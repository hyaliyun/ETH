A New South Wales Country and Indigenous Dreamtime team representative or , he previously played for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks before moving to the Penrith Panthers with whom he won the 2003 NRL Premiership. Playing career =Early career= Campbell was born in Inverell, New South Wales, and started his rugby league career with the Inverell Hawks junior club. He made his NRL debut with the Gold Coast Chargers in 1998 as a fullback. The Chargers were disbanded at the end of the season. =Cronulla Sharks= Preston moved on to play for the Cronulla Sharks in 1999. He spent the first two seasons biding his time in reserve grade and occasionally filling in for injuries in first grade. It was in 2001 that he showed what he was capable of with his feats as a replacement fullback for the injured David Peachey. His electrifying speed and side-step combined with his diminutive stature and humility quickly endeared him to Cronulla fans. It was expected by some that he would eventually return to the lower grades until he was needed again but coach John Lang had other ideas. Clearly Campbell was too talented to be wasted playing in reserve grade. With the return of David Peachey, he was no longer needed at fullback and Cronulla was struggling without a recognised halfback. Finding the solution to two problems Lang pencilled in Campbell for the halfback role. Combining with David Peachey and pivot Adam Dykes, the trio formed a devastating combination on the field as Cronulla pushed forward and made a serious bid for its 2001 finals campaign including one memorable game when Premiership favourites the Newcastle Knights were soundly beaten by the Sharks. At the end of 2001, Preston Campbell was awarded the Dally M Player of the Year, beating Andrew Johns, the Newcastle Knights captain, by one point and became Cronulla's third Dally M medallist. In 2002, with the arrival of new coach Chris Anderson and former Test halfback Brett Kimmorley at the club, he was overlooked for his preferred halfback role in place of Kimmorley. He was instead moved to the unfamiliar position of . After several disastrous games and seemingly very little interest in playing, he was dropped to reserve grade and, stating his desire to return to the position he had made his own, requested a release from Cronulla which was eventually granted in early August 2002. =Penrith Panthers= On 7 August 2002, it was announced that Campbell had agreed to terms with the Penrith Panthers (then under the guidance of his former mentor, John Lang) for a three-year term. Although Campbell had been given no guarantees on which position he would play, he said that he was looking forward to playing under John Lang once more. In his first season with the Penrith Panthers in 2003, and back in his more familiar role at halfback/five-eighth, he proved to be a great asset to the team, playing every minute of every match for the entire season. Campbell played at five-eighth in the 2003 NRL grand final-winning Panthers team, kicking two goals. As 2003 NRL premiers, the Panthers travelled to England to face Super League VIII champions, the Bradford Bulls in the 2004 World Club Challenge. Campbell played at five-eighth, missing his sole goal kick in the Panthers' 22-4 loss. =Gold Coast Titans= In 2005, with two seasons still to play with the Panthers, Campbell was the inaugural signing for the newly admitted NRL club, Gold Coast Titans. Campbell signed a three- year contract which commenced in 2007. Due to injury to other players such as Chris Walker, Campbell spent much of the 2007 season at fullback. Training with the Aboriginal Dreamtime Team, 2008 Campbell had been playing well during the 2007 season and started the 2008 season in good form. He extended his contract with the Titans. He was named the 2008 Gold Coast Titans player of the year for his consistent and inspiring performances throughout the year. In 2009 he played halfback, five-eighth and fullback due to the injuries to players such as Scott Prince and Mat Rogers. Campbell retired at the end of the 2011 season. Accolades In November 2008, Campbell was awarded the Ken Stephen Medal by the NRL at the One Community Awards for his tireless work with Indigenous communities. The award is given for outstanding service to the game, on and off the field. Personal life Campbell is a cousin of Nathan Blacklock and Greg Inglis.

Beda Fomm is known mainly for being the site of the final engagement of Operation Compass in the Second World War.  World War II  In late January 1941, during Operation Compass, the British learned that the Italians were evacuating Cyrenaica by way of Beda Fomm. The 7th Armoured Division was dispatched to intercept the 10th Army. Half way to their destination, it was evident that the division together was too slow and Combeforce, a flying column was sent on the direct route across the desert. On 5 February 1941, Combeforce arrived to cut off the retreating remnants of the 10th Army. The following day, the Italians arrived and attacked but failed to break through the blockade. The fighting was close and often hand-to-hand; at one point, a regimental sergeant major captured an Italian tank by hitting the commander over the head with the butt of his rifle. The final effort came 7 February, when 20 Italian Fiat M13/40 tanks broke through the thin cordon of riflemen and anti-tank guns, only to be stopped by field guns, yards from regimental HQ. The officer commanding Italian forces was General Giuseppe Tellera, who was mortally wounded and Lieutenant-General Ferdinando Cona assumed command, only to be captured by the British.

The hypothetical nature of the individual accounts was crucial in the early adoption of such plans because it enabled conversion of traditional plans without declaring a plan termination.  Basics  The employees' accounts earn a fixed rate of return that can change over a period of time from year to year. Although it works much like a defined-contribution plan, it is actually a defined-benefit plan for legal purposes. In 2003, over 20% of US workers with defined benefit plans were in cash balance plans, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Most of these plans resulted from conversions from traditional defined-benefit plans. The status of such plans was in legal limbo (see below), and the number of conversions slowed. However, legislation was recently passed that cleared the way for plan sponsors to adopt cash balance plans.  Conversion controversy  Cash balance conversions have been controversial and have raised the ire of workers and their advocates. In 2005 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report analyzing the effects of cash balance conversions on worker benefits. They found that in a typical conversion the cash balance plan would provide lower benefits for most workers than if the defined-benefit plan had remained unchanged and the worker had stayed in their job until retirement age. This decline in benefits tends to be largest for older workers. This is because in a traditional plan, where benefits are based on final average pay, the \\"value\\" of the benefits accrues much faster for older workers than for younger workers. In contrast, in a DC or cash balance plan, contributions are made at the same rate (by workers in the DC plans and by the employer in the cash balance plan), and a dollar contributed to a younger worker's account is actually more valuable because it has more time to compound before retirement. Thus some argue that cash balance plans hurt older workers. On the other hand, this may not be the relevant comparison. If the alternative to cash balance conversion is that the plan is frozen or terminated (with the vested balance going to the worker), all workers would be much worse off than in a cash balance conversion. This is a realistic possibility; tens of thousands of defined benefit plans have been frozen and/or terminated in the last two decades, far more than have been converted to cash balance plans. Likewise, for the many employees who leave their job before retirement (whether voluntarily or not), many would be better off under the cash balance conversion than under the original defined-benefit plan. In addition, about half of cash balance conversions have grandfathered in some or all of the existing participants in the defined-benefit plan.  Types of pensions  The ubiquitous 401(k) plan is an example of a defined contribution plan because the Internal Revenue Code §414(i) states [t]hat the term defined-contribution plan means any plan that provides retirement benefits to a worker based solely on the amount contributed to the (worker's individual) account and any (investment) income, gains net of any expenses and losses. Under the definition of accrued benefit under Code §411(a)(7)(A)(ii) in the case of a plan that is not a defined benefit plan, [the term accrued benefit] means the balance [in] the employee's [individual] account. On the other hand, for defined-benefit plans, Section §411(a)(7)(A)(i) states that \\"accrued benefit\\" means \\"the employee’s [] annual benefit\\" as it is \\"determined under the plan … expressed in the form of an … [annuity] … commencing at normal retirement age.\\" Finally, the Code's definition for defined benefit plans are all plans that are not defined contribution plans. Cash balance plans are defined-benefit plans that look like defined- contribution plans. A worker's right to a pension in a defined-benefit plan represents a contingent and hence uncertain financial obligation to the employer sponsoring the plan. Section 412 of the Code requires the employer to make annual contributions to the plan to ensure that the plan assets will be sufficient to pay the promised benefits later at retirement. As part of this process the plan is required to have an actuary perform annual \\"actuarial valuations\\" in which the present value of each worker's \\"accrued benefit\\" is estimated and then each present value for each worker covered by the plan is added up so that the minimum annual contribution can be determined. The \\"actuarial present values\\" for the \\"accrued benefit\\" for each worker is the lump sum dollar amount that represents the financial value of the employer's liability on the date of the valuation. It does not include the future accrual of pension benefits nor does it include the effect of projected future salary increases. Thus the lump sum value for each worker is not based on that worker's projected final salary at retirement, but only the worker's salary on the date of valuation.  Design of plans  Some cash balance plans communicate to workers that these \\"actuarial present values\\" are \\"hypothetical accounts\\" because upon termination of service, the employer will give the former worker the option to take \\"all his money\\" from the pension plan out. In reality, if both the worker and employer agree, even in a normal defined- benefit plan a former worker may take away \\"all his money\\" from the pension plan. There are no legal differences in this \\"portability\\" aspect between a traditional defined-benefit plan and a cash balance plan. A typical \\"design\\" for a cash balance plan would provide each worker a \\"hypothetical account\\" and pay credits in the current year of say 5% of current salary. In addition, the cash balance plan would provide an interest credit of say 6% of the prior year's balance in each worker's \\"hypothetical account\\" so that the current year's balance would be the sum of the prior year's balance and the current year's pay credit and an interest credit on prior year's balance. For a worker who starts at age 25 with a $2000 a month starting salary, he would start with a zero account balance and the first year's pay credit would be $1200 leaving him with an end of first year balance of $1200 in his \\"hypothetical\\" account. Because his beginning of first year balance was zero, his interest credit for the first year is also zero. In his second year, with a 3.5% salary increase his monthly salary would be $2070 on his 26th birthday. The 5% pay credit for this second year would be $1242. Because his second year \\"hypothetical account\\" starts the year with a $1200 balance, the interest credit at 6% would be $72. Adding the beginning balance of $1200 to the $1242 pay credit and $72 interest credit would give an ending balance in the \\"hypothetical\\" account of $2514 ($2514 = $1200 + $1242 + $72) for the second year. Repeat this process for each ensuing year until termination. This creates a hypothetical account balance from which the legally required benefit -- an annuity payable for the life of the participant or beneficiary who elects to commence payment at normal retirement age—can be calculated. This is due to requirement that benefits be definitely determinable found in the IRS Regulations Section 1.401.  Lump sum calculation cases  In 1993, the Third Circuit decided in Goldman v. First National Bank of Boston that the terminated worker did not demonstrate that the adoption of the cash balance plan violated age discrimination rules. In 2000, the Eleventh Circuit in Lyons v. Georgia Pacific and the Second Circuit in Esden v. Bank of Boston decided that the employer violated rules for calculating lump sums, and a district court in Eaton vs. Onan Corp. decided that adopting the cash balance plan did not violate age discrimination rules. In early 2003, the First Circuit in Campbell v. BankBoston did not decide that the employer violated the age discrimination rules against a former worker because the former worker made a procedural error and brought the issue up late. Then in summer of 2003, the Seventh Circuit in Berger v. Xerox Corp. Retirement Plan, decided that the lump sum calculation for workers terminating service prior to retirement who were covered by the defendant cash balance pension plan cannot violate the rules for defined-benefit plans and in a district court in Illinois in Cooper vs. IBM Personal Pension Plan, decided that the very design of the cash balance plan – the issue that the Campbell court only reached in dicta – had indeed violated the age discrimination rules because the \\"rate of benefit accruals\\" did \\"decrease\\" on account the \\"attainment of any age.\\" The Lump Sum cases all held that because cash balance plans were defined-benefit plans, they had to abide by the rules for defined benefit plans when the employer calculates the lump sum actuarial present value by first accruing the account balance to normal retirement age and then converting the account balance at retirement age into a life annuity before then discounting back to the current date at a statutorily required discount rate. Because these cash balance plans were designed to \\"look like\\" defined-contribution plans, the defendants asserted that these cash balance pension plans were not true defined-benefit plans but were \\"hybrid\\" plans instead. Therefore, because, they were \\"hybrids\\" and looked like defined-contribution plans and because workers are only entitled to the actual balance in defined-contribution plans, the plaintiffs should get lump sums equal only to their \\"hypothetical\\" account balances. In Berger v. Xerox, Judge Richard Posner noted in the case – \\"for hybrid read unlawful\\" – held that the lump sum amounts should have been larger. So the cash balance plan is not an exotic \\"hybrid\\" plan in the eyes of the law but remained in the defined-benefit part of the pension taxonomy. This process of taking the account balance forward from the terminated worker's current age up to the worker's normal retirement age, before discounting back to the current age is sometimes called the \\"whipsaw.\\" If the interest rate used for discounting back is lower than the rate used for interest credits on the hypothetical account balances, then the legally required lump sum values would be higher than the worker's account balance in his hypothetical account.  Age discrimination cases  Proponents of cash balance plans advocate that these plans do not violate the age discrimination statutes applicable to defined benefit-pension plans. The statutes forbid – in virtually the same words – any plan from reducing \\"the rate of benefit accrual\\" for any worker on account \\"of the attainment of any age\\". Although the Code defines the \\"accrued benefit\\" for any worker covered by defined-benefit plans as \\"expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age\\" and defines \\"normal retirement benefit\\" as the \\"greater of the early retirement benefit under the plan, or the benefit under the plan commencing at normal retirement age\\", the supporters of such cash balance plans still argue that the terms \\"accrued benefit\\" and \\"rate of benefit accrual\\" are ambiguous or undefined. In Onan Corp., District Court Judge Hamilton agreed with the supporters of cash balance plans and held that the cash balance plan design did not violate age discrimination because the terms \\"rate of benefit accrual\\" and \\"accrued benefit\\" were not defined in the relevant statutes. But the terms \\"accrued benefit\\" and \\"rate of benefit accrual\\" have long been very familiar and unambiguous to pension actuaries. It was because the terms were so unambiguous to actuaries that they could construct the initial balances in each worker's \\"hypothetical\\" account for these new cash balance pension plans. Also, §411(a)(1)(7) of the Code defines \\"accrued benefit\\". Thus pension actuaries are very familiar with changes in accrual rate factors used in a traditional defined-benefit pension plan's formula. In Kathi Cooper v. IBM Personal Pension Plan, District Court Judge Murphy in 2003 came to the opposite conclusion because the terms accrued benefit and rate of benefit accrual were not ambiguous. According to Murphy benefits accrued at a decreasing rate solely based on increases in age, the plan design of the cash balance plan violated the age discrimination statutes. If this rule is upheld, then all \\"flat rate pay credit\\" design cash balance plans would violate age discrimination. A plan sponsor could avoid these problems by setting up a cash balance plan with steadily increasing – or age graded – rates for pay credits. This has the same economic effect as adopting a \\"career average salary\\" traditional defined-benefit plan. The ruling was reversed on appeal in 2006.IBM ruling gives boost to cash balance plansUnited States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit - No. 05-3588 Legislative developments Because of the troublesome age discrimination suits and misunderstanding and frustration by older workers covered by such plans, Congress, notably Senator Charles Grassley (R) of Iowa, has a proposal to statutorily fix the problem. It involves outlawing \\"wearaway\\". The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law in August 2006 and prospectively made the flat salary credit type plans immune from age discrimination. Also, the use of a higher interest rate for calculation of lump sums is now allowed as the new law eliminates the whipsaw. The law fixes age discrimination only prospectively.

The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram is a morning daily newspaper with a website that serves southern Maine and is focused on the greater metropolitan area around Portland, Maine, in the United States. Founded in 1862, its roots extend to Maine’s earliest newspapers, the Falmouth Gazette & Weekly Advertiser, started in 1785, and the Eastern Argus, first published in Portland in 1803. For most of the 20th century, it was the cornerstone of Guy Gannett Communications, before being sold to The Seattle Times Company in 1998. Today, it is the flagship of MaineToday Media publications, headquartered in South Portland, and is part of the state’s largest news- gathering organization, including the newspapers of the Lewiston-based Sun Media Group.  History  The Portland Daily Press was founded in June 1862 by J. T. Gilman, Joseph B. Hall, and Newell A. Foster as a new Republican paper. Its first issue, published June 23, 1862, announced strong support for Abraham Lincoln and condemned slavery as \\"the foulest blot upon our national character.\\" The paper quickly gained the largest circulation in Portland, and was one of five daily newspapers in the city to survive to the 20th century. In 1904 the paper was bought by a syndicate of Maine Republicans, including Henry B. Cleaves, and gubernatorial candidate Joseph Homan Manley, who the paper had previously opposed. It was merged with the Portland Herald in 1921 to form the Portland Press Herald in a sale of the Press from then U.S. Senator Frederick Hale to Guy P. Gannett, who had bought the Herald earlier the same year. The first edition of the Portland Press Herald was published in November 21, 1921. The Press Heralds circulation skyrocketed in the first year of Gannett's ownership, when the paper sold for 2 cents; circulation went from a little over 18,000 to nearly 29,000. Under Gannett's ownership, the traditionally pro-Republican newspaper adopted a balanced editorial approach; during the 1922 gubernatorial campaign, the newspaper published Democratic candidate William Robinson Pattangall's criticism of the Republican incumbent, Governor Percival Baxter. In a letter to readers, Gannett wrote, \\"The American people think for themselves. They want and should be given the news and all the news fully and uncolored by any personal or political consideration.\\" In the 1920s, Gannett's media empire in Maine grew: he purchased the Portland Evening Express and Daily Advertiser in 1925 (whose name he shortened to Evening Express) and by 1929 also bought Augusta's Kennebec Journal and Waterville's Central Maine Morning Sentinel. In 1923, Gannett built a new building to house all of the paper's operations on 390 Congress Street across from Portland City Hall. In 2010, the newspaper vacated that building and moved its news staff to nearby One City Center.Portland Press Herald vacates longtime home, Associated Press (May 24, 2010). In 2015, a hotel (the Press Hotel) opened in the newspaper's former headquarters.Diane Bair & Pamela Wright, Hotel opens in old Portland Press Herald building, Boston Globe (April 5, 2015). The newspaper's printing and distribution functions are located in South Portland.

Editorial stance The newspaper's predecessor, the Portland Daily Press, was formed as a pro-Republican newspaper in an era when most American newspapers had strong political allegiances. In the 1920s, under Guy P. Gannett's leadership, the newspaper adopted a more balanced editorial approach, and today the news and opinion sections of the paper are separate. In 1929 and 1930, the Portland Press Herald and the Portland Evening News \\"waged an editorial war\\" about the Kellogg–Briand Pact and the 1930 London Conference on naval arms limitations: the Evening News took a pacifist view, arguing in favor of the Pact; the Press Herald took the opposite view, calling the Pact \\"a delusion and a dream.\\"Robert E. Jenner, FDR's Republicans: Domestic Political Realignment and American Foreign Policy (Lexington Books, 2010), p. 18. This dispute illustrated a political chasm within the Maine Republican Party at the time between \\"Old Guard regulars\\" and pacifists. Later in the 20th century, the Press Herald was regarded as having a more liberal and pro-Democratic editorial stance than the Bangor Daily News, which leaned toward conservatism and Republicans.Christian P. Potholm, This Splendid Game: Maine Campaigns and Elections, 1940-2002 (Lexington Books: 2004), p. 9. Over its history, however, the Press Herald \\"has covered and endorsed candidates of various political persuasions, including independents Angus King, who was elected governor in 1994 and 1998, and Eliot Cutler, who came in second in the 2010 gubernatorial campaign.\\" The Press Herald endorsed conservative Republican candidates (Dean Scontras and Jason Levesque) in both of Maine's congressional districts in 2010.\\"Our Endorsements for Congress\\".

In the 2016 presidential election, the paper's editorial board endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

Head played one game in the NHL with the Detroit Red Wings during the 1967-68 NHL season and wore #15. Juniors Head started out playing in the Grande Prairie Minor Hockey Association at age 13. Three years later, Head would make the jump to what is known as \\"senior hockey\\" and play in the South Peace Hockey League as a member of the Grande Prairie Athletics, where he would win SPHL Rookie Of The Year honors in 1963-64. He remained with the Athletics until midway through the 1964-65 season, where he received an invite from the Edmonton Oil Kings. Head remained with the Oil Kings during the 1965-66 season, where he faced off against the Oshawa Generals, a team led by future hockey Hall Of Fame member Bobby Orr. The Oil Kings would go on to defeat the Generals and would win the Memorial Cup. Head would score 16 points in 19 games during the 1965-66 post-season. Head continued to play with the Oil Kings for one more season, scoring 50 goals and 42 assists and trailing only Garnet \\"Ace\\" Bailey in regular season point totals. Professional Head received an invitation from the NHL's Detroit Red Wings to attend training camp in the fall of 1967. In camp, he was assigned #15 and was given $130 for a one-game tryout but was eventually released on September 22. Head was later assigned to the Johnstown Jets, a team in the Eastern Hockey League. He would score 53 goals in his rookie season. As a result, Head was recalled by Detroit where he would \\"play six or seven shifts\\" in his only game with the Red Wings. Head would also see time with the Fort Worth Wings, another Detroit affiliate. The following season, Head had his best statistical season. He would score 67 goals and 121 points in 72 games, which led all EHL players. Head later became player/coach of the Jets during the 1973-74 season as a result of a coach walking out prior to the start of the season. Head was later named official head coach that season and be named captain of the team. He would play until the 1975-76 season, where he would retire after eight seasons with the Jets. Despite being retired from hockey since 1976, many of Head's statistics are among the highest in Johnstown history. His 308 goals as a member of the Jets ranks third all time, while his 601 points rank fourth and his 293 assists are sixth highest. His 67 goal season and 69 single season goals (regular and post-season) were a record until former Johnstown Chiefs forward Mark Green eclipsed the totals with 68 goals in the regular season and 70 single season goals in 1991-92. Personal Head, like several members of the 1975-76 Johnstown Jets, had a part in the movie Slap Shot. He played one of the uncredited hockey players. His wife, Grace Head, had a credited speaking part as \\"Pam\\" one of the hockey wives in the movie. Head was one of several people responsible for founding the Bishop McCort hockey program in 1985. With Head leading the team as head coach, McCort would go to win three Pennsylvania state championships over a period of eleven years. On October 18, 2003, Head was only the third person to have their number retired by the Johnstown Chiefs. Although he did not play for the Chiefs, as they were founded after his retirement, he was recognized for his contributions as a player with the Jets, his tenure with the Chiefs providing game night scouting reports, and for his contributions to hockey to the city of Johnstown. He is also a member of the Cambria County Sports Hall of Fame, the Johnstown Hockey Hall Of Fame, and the Grande Prairie Hockey Hall of Fame. Head died in Johnstown, Pennsylvania on March 14, 2020.

Several months after the assignment, Bristow was exposed by Toronto Sun reporter Bill Dunphy, in August 1994. His work inside the Heritage Front became highly controversial in Canada, when exposed, due to much of his activity being viewed as that of a contributory nature, reflected by an August 14, 1994 Toronto Sun headline, \\"Spy Unmasked: CSIS Informant 'Founding Father' of white racist group\\". Career and initial CSIS work Grant Bristow began his career as a private investigator, working with several Toronto-based investigation firms through the early and mid-1980s. Through this work, he developed both the personality and resources necessary to perform covert infiltrations and intelligence gathering. Bristow's CSIS involvement commenced in 1986 through an official at the South African embassy, then a rogue state. He was hired to perform security work at their Ottawa embassy, which was the target of many demonstrations at the time due to the nation's continued Apartheid policy. According to an interview Bristow gave to The Walrus in September 2004, and as implied in the SIRC report of December 1995, one of two Embassy officials he had contact with at the time also requested he gather and provide intelligence on the Canadian anti-Apartheid demonstrators individually. He says he was opposed to this idea (gathering intelligence on Canadians for a foreign government), desiring only to provide security for the embassy. However, he feigned interest in the proposal and secretly arranged a meeting with a CSIS officer to report the Official's request. This meeting marked the beginning of Bristow's involvement with the intelligence agency. Following the meeting with the CSIS representative Bristow proceeded to co- operate, reporting details on the progression of the 'mission'. His work was successful and on August 20, 1986, the Canadian government expelled one of the South African officials and prohibited the other from re-entry to Canada designating him persona non grata. Introduction to the Canadian far-right He maintained his relationship with CSIS and the following year (while employed by day as an in-house investigator for a shipping firm), after being introduced through an acquaintance to far-right activist Max French, reported the introduction to his handlers. Satisfied with his previous performance, they encouraged him to befriend French and see what information he could gather on the activities of Canada's far-right. Due to his lack of any substantive knowledge, Bristow was given a crash-course introduction to the major players of the far-Right, as well as a copy of the Turner Diaries to familiarize himself with. His relationship with French bore little fruit and was short-lived. Fortunately for Bristow, an associate subsequently introduced him to another far-right sympathizer who provided an \\"in\\" via Don Andrews' Nationalist Party of Canada. It was through this introduction and his attendance of Nationalist Party meetings that he made the connections and gathered the information that allowed the commencement of what was to be called \\"Operation Governor\\". Operation Governor begins Operation Governor began in the autumn of 1988. Its original scope was extremely broad, with no particular targets or goals. Its primary function was basically nothing more than gathering any and all information available to him. The Autumn of 1988 was an ideal time for this mission to begin primarily because many of the groups were lacking in numbers and intelligent membership. As an educated professional, Bristow was an attractive prospect. These factors made it simpler for him to infiltrate without raising any eyebrows. Bristow quickly became friends with Party leader Don Andrews, crediting their fast friendship with \\"mirroring\\", an intelligence technique where one mimics the target's thoughts and feelings, forging a bond to gain trust. Through his friendship with Andrews, he attended a 'Welcome Home' party for Wolfgang Droege, returning from a US prison where he served time for cocaine trafficking and a weapons charge. This was his first encounter with Droege, with whom he immediately struck up rapport. After a few conversations he realized that unlike the primarily verbal Andrews, Droege was the real thing. He was interested in taking real action in support of his extreme ideas, which motivated Bristow to slowly move his focus and efforts from Andrews to Droege. In total, Bristow was paid $50,000 by CSIS.New York Times, Canada's Security Agency Accused of Spying on Canadians, August 28, 1994 Nationalist Party and Libya visit As time progressed and Bristow became further involved in the far-right, he was promoted from member to Security Chief of the Nationalist Party. Throughout this time his friendship with Droege continued to grow, with Droege revealing more and more about himself and his past. Looking back on these times in 2005, Bristow said, \\"I was keeping watch over violent hate groups, it was the right thing to do.\\"Mitrovica, The Walrus, September 2004, page 36. From this position, he screened and collected detailed personal information on all new members, which was promptly copied and forwarded to CSIS. By mid-1989 however, Droege was increasingly dissatisfied with Andrews and the Party and began considering a departure to form a new group more to his liking. In late July 1989, Libyan head of state Muammar al-Gaddafi invited delegates from the Nationalist party to attend celebrations for the 20th Anniversary of his revolution, all expenses paid. Andrews was unable to attend due to legal obligations, so Droege and Bristow went together at Droege's insistence. Their flight to Libya took them to Rome, where Italian Intelligence officers detained them and unsuccessfully attempted to convince them to cancel their Libyan visit. They arrived in Tripoli with many other extremists from around the world (Qadaffi had invited many leaders of far-left and far-right movements around the world, hoping to unite them in opposition to their common enemy in Zionism), but despite their best efforts Droege left with only $1000(US) gift. On their way home the plane stopped in Chicago, where due to his previous trafficking convictions Droege was arrested (having been barred from entering the United States) and detained, while Bristow was again detained as well and strip-searched. He was furious upon his return (Droege was still being held by US authorities), having gone through terrible stress worrying that either foreign intelligence service encounter could have blown his cover. He fumed at his CSIS handlers, accusing them of using him as \\"an expendable pawn.\\"Mitrovica, The Walrus, September 2004, page 9. This prompted the amendment of his agreement with them to include that he 'must be informed beforehand of any future takedowns'. The Heritage Front saga Prior to Droege's release from U.S. custody and subsequent return to Canada, he became convinced that Andrews had somehow arranged his arrest, the final catalyst in the formation of what was to be the Heritage Front. Bristow was along every step of the way, a close confidant of Droege's throughout this period. Bristow claims that he used this confidence to dissuade Droege from undertaking a number of potentially illegal or violent acts. As the Front was formed and began to grow, Bristow documented and relayed to CSIS details of an eco-terrorism plot against North American agriculture being promoted by an American Aryan Nations member to Droege. Bristow managed to talk Droege out of going to Libyan agents in New York with the information, which was altogether scientifically unsound anyhow. It was nonetheless a sobering indication of the extremes to which Droege would go, and provided further justification for the mission to CSIS. During this period, Bristow got to know the upper echelons of Canadian and international white supremacy and revisionism, serving as a bodyguard for both David Irving and Ernst Zündel. As well, Droege sent Bristow to rendezvous with Terry Long, leader of the Canadian chapter of Aryan Nations. Immediately taking to Bristow, Long passed on the membership list of his group with 180 names for Droege's use, which Bristow copied and provided to CSIS. After this success (and a CSIS-sponsored British vacation), he left with Droege and Zündel for an international Far-right symposium in Germany. In his capacity as security for the Canadian contingent, he video and photodocumented the conference, again providing the data to CSIS. The conference was raided by German Police, however, and Droege and Bristow narrowly avoided arrest. The arrest of Zündel in the raid dashed CSIS' hopes of identifying the major foreign financiers of Canada's Far-right. Shortly after his return to Canada he was dispatched by the Front to travel to Richard Butler's famed Aryan Nations compound in Idaho. CSIS agreed to this, hoping to acquire the identities of Canadian attendees. It was here that the interconnectedness of the North American Far-right became clear, and the prevailing danger evident. Visits from major American racists like Tom Metzger of White Aryan Resistance were cut short through Bristow's disclosing to CSIS of their whereabouts, so they could be arrested and deported. Final days in the Front It was from the publicity generated by these sorts of arrests that major opposition to the Front began to rise. Groups like Anti-Racist Action began to appear, and were present whenever the Front was in Court or on the streets. Tensions were building, and so were numbers on both sides. Bristow walked a very fine line, his role in CSIS preventing him from engaging in the ever-growing violence, a potential Achilles' Heel for his ongoing espionage. These demonstrations and counter-demonstrations culminated in a riot in Ottawa on May 29, 1993, with physical attacks taking place against parties on both sides. These events culminated in calls by the majority of young and angry Front members for retaliatory attacks, and when these calls went unanswered by the Front's leadership, a splinter gang of violent white power skinheads was formed. Bristow passed an emergency message onto his CSIS handlers. Immediately this gang sprang into action, robbing a donut shop the first night and threatening a major attack on the Canadian Jewish Congress. The group had a large weapons cache when police apprehended them. Soon after these incidents and under the guise of job-hunting, Bristow took a US vacation to marry his girlfriend. Upon his return it became evident he would be forced to terminate his involvement with the front, as Droege was being charged with assault and if Droege was imprisoned, Bristow would become the de facto leader of the Front, an untenable position for a government-employed mole. The exit wouldn't be easy, but not terribly difficult either. Due to the legal hurdles and a general dwindling of support (both public and internal), the Front was beginning to fade. Bristow soon informed Droege of his plan to leave the movement for a job in Eastern Canada, Droege was sad but grateful for the friendship they had and Bristow's efforts for the movement. It was March 1994 when Operation Governor officially concluded, Bristow having prepared dossiers on remaining Far-righters who still posed a threat of some sort beforehand. Bristow's exposure On August 12, 1994, Bristow was contacted by Toronto Sun reporter Bill Dunphy, who informed him he was about to go to press with a story about Bristow's being a CSIS asset and exposing much of his Front activity through the duration of his work. Given the violent tendencies of his former targets, Bristow requested Dunphy not to publish the story, but Dunphy insisted and went to press just two days later -- on 14 August 1994. Bristow realized he had to get his family and himself out of Toronto and into hiding immediately and CSIS obliged. They were first moved to Jasper for a brief stay and opportunity to evade the situation while plans were made. Eventually resettled in Alberta, his 1995 return to Toronto for a funeral again found him caught by the media, with a CSIS crisis team having to meet to deal with a Toronto Star reporter's questions and subsequent publishing of the identities of and photos of both Bristow and his wife. Feeling apathetic by this point due to stress, they decided simply to return home and hope for the best. 2004 media interview For the first time, Bristow decided in September 2004 to break his silence regarding the whole issue, and granted an in-depth interview to the Canadian current affairs magazine The Walrus, which led to a resurgence of media coverage around the issue. In the interview, Bristow gives details about his time with CSIS, activities before and after the affair and his current life. While he remains concerned about retaliation, he has largely moved on in his life and has let go of the past.

It responds to Charles Dickens' character Miss Havisham from his novel Great Expectations, looking at Havisham's mental and physical state many decades after being left standing at the altar, when the bride-to-be is in her old age. It expresses Havisham's anger at her fiancé and her bitter rage over wedding-day trauma and jilted abandonment. Duffy's use of language is very powerful and passionate. Throughout the poem oxymorons and juxtaposition such as \\"Beloved sweetheart bastard\\" and \\"Love's hate\\" portrays the ambivalence and restless uncertainty of the character, while a sexual fantasy reveals both the unrequited love and the passion that remains within Havisham following the wedding, a devastation from which her heart has never recovered. The poem is featured in the examining board AQA's English Literature Anthology for its GCSE qualification in English Literature. It is featured alongside works by Duffy, and three other contemporary writers: Simon Armitage, Seamus Heaney and Gillian Clarke. This poem is also featured in the Scottish Qualifications Authority's National 5 and Higher English Critical Reading paper, in the Scottish Texts section. Candidates study Anne Hathaway, War Photographer, Originally, Valentine and Mrs Midas alongside this poem. \\"Havisham\\" Beloved sweetheart bastard. Not a day since then I haven't wished him dead, Prayed for it so hard I've dark green pebbles for eyes, ropes on the back of my hands I could strangle with. Spinster. I stink and remember. Whole days in bed cawing Nooooo at the wall; the dress yellowing, trembling if I open the wardrobe; the slewed mirror, full-length, her, myself, who did this to me? Puce curses that are sounds not words. Some nights better, the lost body over me, my fluent tongue in its mouth in its ear then down till I suddenly bite awake. Love's hate behind a white veil; a red balloon bursting in my face. Bang. I stabbed at a wedding- cake. Give me a male corpse for a long slow honeymoon. Don't think it's only the heart that b-b-b-breaks.

Prior to February 12, 2003 it was an independent city; on that date, it and Gallix, Quebec were merged into Sept-Îles. History Originally Moisie was a small fisherman village that had been located at the mouth of the Moisie River. The village, which was at sea level, was relocated in 1967 after several storm surge floods. The community became home to RCAF Station Moisie in the late 1950s, when the Royal Canadian Air Force established a Pinetree Line early warning radar station nearby. The facility was later renamed CFS Moisie and closed by the early 1990s after defence cutbacks. Molson Inc. established a smelter on the other bank of the river in the late 19th century. The company was plowing through three feet of pure iron black sand lying on the beaches as raw material for the forge. Prospectors later explored the region upstream of the river which led to the discovery of large iron ore deposits around Labrador City and Schefferville.

He had been appointed by the Council of Chalcedon to replace the deposed Dioscorus.  History  Proterius was elected by the Council of Chalcedon in 451 to replace Dioscorus of Alexandria, who had been deposed as Patriarch by the same council.Evagrius Scholasticus, Ecclesiastical History (AD431-594), translated by E. Walford (1846). Book 2, chapter 5 His accession marks the beginning of the Schism of 451 between the Coptic Orthodox and the Greek Orthodox patriarchs of Alexandria, which has never been completely resolved. Because the church of Alexandria was largely anti-Chalcedonian, the deposition of Dioscorus, an anti-Chalcedonian, from the Patriarchate, and the elevation of Proterius, a Chalcedonian, to it, was violently opposed. Finally in 457 the anti-Chalcedonian party in Alexandria elected Timothy Aelurus as Patriarch of Alexandria, in opposition to Proterius, who was either subsequently martyred by a Coptic mob (Evagrius Scholasticus, 2, 8 ) or murdered by the Byzantine garrison in Alexandria (Zachariah of Mitylene, 4,1-3 ). The murder was commented in several letters by groups of bishops from various Roman provinces (e.g. Galatia Prima) or larger regions to Byzantine emperor Leo I the Thracian (457–474).  Veneration  He is regarded as a Saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church. He is not recognized as a Pope by the Coptic Orthodox, who instead recognize Dioscorus and Timothy as having been the legitimate Popes during this time.

The name often reflects an urban legend that the sound of a baby can be, or has been, heard from the bridge. Many are also accompanied by an urban legend relating to a baby or young child/children Virginia There is an alleged \\"Crybaby\\" bridge in Blackstone, Virginia. The story goes that some children died around the bridge (accounts vary as to whether their death was accidental or intentional), and that at night their cries can be heard and a woman can be seen walking along the edge of the woods. Other phenomena reported include footsteps and the feeling of an 'evil presence.' It is also alleged that if a car is stopped on the bridge and baby powder is poured on the hood, baby footprints may appear in the powder. Kentucky A bridge on Sleepy Hollow Road near the border between Jefferson and Oldham counties in Kentucky was known as Crybaby Bridge. Reportedly, mothers would drop their unwanted, sick, or deformed babies off the bridge to drown in the water, and their crying can still be heard there. The original bridge has been replaced by a newer one made of steel and concrete. The bridge is one of several rumors about locations along Sleepy Hollow Road. Ohio =Rogue's Hollow= One of many purported crybaby bridges is located near Doylestown, Ohio, in an area known as Rogue's Hollow. This bridge is located on Galehouse Road, between Rogue Hollow Road and Hametown Road. The bridge spans Silver Creek. Deep in Rogue's Hollow, this road previously led from the bottom of the hollow (Hametown Rd.) to the top (Rogue Hollow Rd.). The bridge is only approachable from Hametown Rd. from October to May, as the steeper portion of the road is seasonally closed to prevent accidents. The bridge is property of the Rogue's Hollow historical society, which also owns the adjacent Chidester Mill.Rogue's Hollow Historical Society; \\"Map to the Mill\\" link refers to the bridge; road and creek are visible in \\"Chidester Hill\\" photo. Map: =The Screaming Bridge of Maud Hughes Road= Maud Hughes Road is located in Liberty Township, Butler County, Ohio. It is reputed to have been the site of many terrible accidents and suicides. Railroad tracks lie 25 feet below the bridge, and at least 36 people are said to have been reported dead on or around the Maud Hughes Road Bridge. Ghostly figures, mists, and lights have been reported, as well as black hooded figures and a phantom train. The legend says that a car carrying a man and a woman stalled on top of the bridge. The man got out to get help while the girl stayed. When the man returned, the girl was hanging on the bridge above the tracks. The man then supposedly perished with unexplained causes. To this day, many people have reported hearing the ghosts' conversations, then a woman's scream followed by a man's scream. A second story is that a woman was being chased down the road and when she got to the bridge she did not know the area and thought that there was a river underneath, so she jumped over the bridge and when she saw the train tracks screamed all the way down to her death. They say that to this day on certain nights you can still hear her screaming. Another popular and typical Crybaby Bridge story says that a woman once threw her baby off the bridge and hung herself afterwards. Map: =Egypt Road, Salem= Crybaby Bridge off Egypt Road Although the bridge is off of Egypt Road near Salem, Ohio, it is actually on what used to be West Pine Lake Rd., which now dead-ends to the east of the bridge. Legends attribute the crying baby to one that fell in and accidentally drowned. There is also a rumor that there is a cult of some sort in the woods surrounding the bridge. In 2010, there was a murder of an elderly woman that was found, strangled to death and burned just off the bridge. The closed road remains as an access way to high-voltage utility lines. The \\"baby cries\\" have been said to be heard at night or during the day. Map: =Wisner Road= This crybaby bridge is in the area of the melon heads. The bridge is on Wisner Road in Chardon Township, Geauga County, Ohio, just north of Kirtland Chardon Rd. A large section of the road is permanently closed; the bridge lies just before the south end of the closed section.  Maryland  In Weird Maryland: Your Travel Guide to Maryland's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets, authors Matt Lake, Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman include three first-person narratives of crybaby bridge experiences in Maryland. The locations mentioned are the Governor's Bridge Road bridge, one on Lottsford Vista Road and a third unspecified, but possibly described the Lottsford Vista Road bridge as well. The latter narratives make mention of purported Satanic churches near the bridge and appearance of the Goatman.Matt Lake, Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman: Weird Maryland: Your Travel Guide to Maryland's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets Page 178 Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., Accessed via Google Books August 17, 2008  Texas  =De Kalb= \\"Crybaby Bridge\\", or \\"Spook Bridge\\", located about 25 miles west of Texarkana, runs across county road 4130, located 4 miles south of De Kalb, Texas. Legend says that a mother driving a car plunged into the creek and the baby drowned in the near-freezing waters. =Lufkin= Jack Creek, a stream west of Lufkin, Texas, has for years been known as Cry Baby Creek, supposedly because a woman and a baby died when their auto veered off a wooden bridge and fell into the steep creek. Annette Sawyer of Lufkin said visitors who come to the site at night claim they have heard sounds resembling a baby crying. One visitor supposedly found the imprint of a baby’s hand on her auto window after returning from the bridge. =Port Neches= \\"Sarah Jane Bridge\\" on East Port Neches Avenue in Port Neches, Texas is said to be the bridge from which a baby of the same name was thrown into the alligator-infested water by a man who had murdered the child's mother. It is said Sarah Jane can be heard crying from the water when one stands on the bridge on hot summer nights. The child's mother, a headless ghost wandering the woods nearby, can also be heard whispering \\"Sarah Jane\\" as she searches the forest with a lantern. The legendary Sarah Jane is Sarah Jane Block, who lost no children and lived to the age of 99. Utah Locals from the small town of Bear River City, Utah claim that many years ago a mother drove off the bridge with her two children in the car, killing all three of them. It is said that honking the horn three times will elicit a response from the ghostly children. Some claim to have heard a child's voice saying \\"Don't do it, Mother!\\"  Controversy  In 1999, Maryland folklorist Jesse Glass presented a case against several crybaby bridges being genuine folklore, contending that they were instead fakelore that was knowingly being propagated through the internet. According to Glass, nearly identical stories of crybaby bridges in Maryland and Ohio began to appear online in 1999, but they could not be confirmed through local oral history or the media. Among Glass' examples was the story of a bridge located in Westminster, Maryland, which concerned the murder of escaped slaves and African American children. It's located specifically on Rockland Road, just off of Uniontown Road outside of Westminster's city limits past Rt. 31. In the 1800s the story held, unwanted black babies were drowned by being thrown off this bridge. Regional newspapers, such as the American Sentinel and the Democratic Advocate, which usually covered racially motivated murders of the period, make no mention of the events described online. However, in their book Weird U.S.: Your Travel Guide to America's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets, authors Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman relate the story of a purported crybaby bridge on Lottsford Vista Road between Bowie and Upper Marlboro, asserting that this bridge has \\"made believers out of many skeptics.\\"Moran; Sceurman, p.22 The text included from their informant makes no mention of escaped slaves but does repeat a familiar component of such legends: an out-of-wedlock birth.

It is, within the Canadian system of honours, the third highest of the war and operational service medals. Design Designed by Bruce W. Beatty, the Gulf and Kuwait Medal is in the form of a diameter rhodium plated tombac disc with, on the obverse, the Latin words ELIZABETH II DEI GRATIA REGINA (Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, Queen) and CANADA surrounding an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II, symbolizing her roles as both fount of honour and Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces. On the reverse is a laurel wreath with a maple leaf at its base encircling the words: GULF AND KUWAIT • 1990-1991 • LE GOLFE ET KUWAIT. This medallion is worn at the left chest, suspended on a 31.8mm wide ribbon coloured with vertical stripes in light blue (representing the Air Command), scarlet (representing the Land Force Command), and dark blue (recalling the Maritime Command), symmetrically flanking a sand coloured central stripe. Originally, the Gulf and Kuwait medal was to have coincidentally had the same ribbon as the British Gulf Medal; only after the manufacturer of the ribbon informed the Chancellery of Honours at Rideau Hall were the two shades of blue on the Canadian version reversed. Should an individual already possessing a Gulf and Kuwait Medal be awarded the medal bar for combat service, he or she is granted a clasp in cupro-nickel and bearing a maple leaf for wear on the ribbon from which the original medal is suspended. Eligibility and allocation On 2 August 1990, Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Cabinet under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, created the Gulf and Kuwait Medal to recognize members of the Canadian Forces who had served in the theatre of the Gulf War. To qualify for the medal, individuals had to have served for 30 consecutive days between 2 August 1990 and 27 June 1991 in the region of the Persian Gulf as a part of the operation to liberate Kuwait from the invading Iraqi forces, and those who for a minimum of one day engaged in direct combat with the enemy during the offensive that lasted from 16 January to 3 March 1991 were entitled to receive the additional medal bar; in total, 4,436 medals were issued, along with 3,184 bars.

He became one of Illinois' first two Senators, and is best known as the author of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. After his retirement from the U.S. Senate in 1829 he lived the rest of his life in Ohio.Appleton's Cyclopedia, vol. VI, p. 84http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/22838 Early and family life Thomas was probably born in Shepherdstown, Virginia (now West Virginia), in part according to his 1850 census entry, although Appleton's Cyclopedia stated he was born somewhat east on what became the National Road in Hagerstown, Maryland (as was his slightly elder brother) and that he was descended from Lord Baltimore. His family moved to Kentucky when Jesse was an infant. He married Rebecca McKenzie (1776-1851) of New York, but they had no children who survived. Career Thomas studied law with his elder brother Richard Symmes Thomas (1772-1828) in Bracken County, Kentucky along the Ohio River, then moved to nearby Mason County, Kentucky, where he served as the county clerk until 1803. He then moved north of the Ohio River to Lawrenceburg in Indiana Territory, where he continued to practice law and became the territorial deputy attorney general in 1805. In the same year, he began serving as a delegate to the Territorial House of Representatives, and fellow delegates chose him as their speaker from 1805 to 1808. When Benjamin Parke resigned as the territorial delegate to Congress, Thomas was appointed to fill the vacancy from October 22, 1808 until March 3, 1809 when Thomas moved westward to the new Illinois Territory as discussed below. Jonathan Jennings succeeded him as Indiana's territorial delegate and would later become the new state of Indiana's first U.S. representative and later Indiana's Governor. Thomas moved westward to Kaskaskia, Illinois on the Mississippi River (which made it flood- prone and ultimately transformed it into an island), then Cahokia and later Edwardsville in Madison County, Illinois, where Thomas would later train his nephew, somewhat confusingly named Jesse B. Thomas, Jr., who would have a distinguished career as an Illinois lawyer and judge. When Illinois became a territory in 1809, President James Madison (with the consent of the U.S. Senate) appointed Thomas judge of the United States court for the northwestern judicial district. Thomas exercised those duties from 1809 until 1818. Voters from St. Clair County (the oldest county in Illinois and with Cahokia as its major town) elected Thomas as Democratic-Republican to the Illinois State Constitutional Convention in 1818. Fellow delegates elected him to preside over the convention, which chose not to accept slavery in the new state. Upon the new state's admittance to the Union, fellow legislators elected Thomas to the U.S. Senate, in which he would serve for two terms (from 1818 until his retirement in 1829). In 1820, Thomas proposed the Missouri Compromise to limit slavery above the southern border of Missouri. In 1823 he switched parties and became a Crawford Republican. He served as chairman on the Committee on Public Lands in the 16th and 18th Congresses. He refused the nomination for a third term and moved to Mount Vernon, Ohio in 1829, where he lived the rest of his life.

Early years Alexander Vertinsky and his elder sister Nadezhda were born in Kiev (modern- day Ukraine) out of wedlock: their parents couldn't marry since his father's first wife (\\"Varvara, an elderly, evil and unattractive woman\\") refused a divorce, so he had to adopt his own children. Both parents belonged to the Russian Orthodox Church.Alexander Vertinsky (1990). By the Long Road... — Moscow: Pravda, His father Nikolai Petrovich Vertinsky (1845—1894) came from a railwayman's family.Alexander Vertinsky (1989). Quarter Century Without Motherland. — Kiev: Muzychina Ukraina, p. 4 (Memoirs) He was a well-known lawyer – according to Alexander, especially popular among poor people, because he defended them for free and even helped financially, — and an occasional journalist (he published feuilletons under a pen name Graf Niver). While Alexander considered himself Russian in general, he recognised his Ukrainian ancestry and Ukrainian as one of his native languages. In his letters Vertinsky recalled a time when he was working at Dovzhenko Film Studios and Ukrainian actress Natalia Uzhviy was surprised to hear his Ukrainian accent: In 1949 he wrote to his wife: While on his mother side he was of Ukrainian ancestry,Александр ВЕРТИНСКИЙ: «Я существую на правах публичного дома: все ходят, но в обществе говорить об этом не прилично» he was sure that on his fathers side he had some Polish blood too, as \\"I never met people with my surname in Russia, but in Poland it is met more or less often... one of my great-grandfathers was probably a Pole\\".Vertinsky Nikolai Petrovich with his brother Feofan Petrovich photo from the Our Heritage magazine, Moscow, 1990, p. 904 Alexander's mother Eugenia Stepanovna Skolatskaya came from a noble family, but the parents rejected her after she had given birth to illegitimate children. She died when Alexander was only three years old from sepsis after an unsuccessful surgery, and in two years his father also died from tuberculosis. As Alexander described it, Nikolai Vertinsky couldn't accept his wife's death, spent a lot of time at the cemetery and at one point was found unconscious near her tomb, which led to his illness and quick death.Eugenia Stepanovna Skolatskaya photo from the Our Heritage magazine, Moscow, 1990, p. 915 Vertinsky was brought up by his mother's sister Maria Stepanovna, while Nadezhda was raised by her other sister, Lidia Stepanovna. They didn't want siblings to meet, to the point that Alexander was told that his sister had died, and vice versa; only years later he saw her name in a theatrical magazine and contacted her. In 1898 he entered the First Kiev Gymnasium meant for children of aristocracy. He was expelled from the second grade and moved to the less prestigious 4th Kiev Gymnasium. In 1905 he was expelled once again, this time from the fifth grade. Vertinsky didn't enjoy studying, blaming his aunt who \\"knew nothing about raising children\\". He tried various jobs before starting to earn his living by contributing short stories to the Kievan periodicals. In 1912 Vertinsky and his sister moved to Moscow, where he failed in his ambition to join Konstantin Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theatre. During that time, he became addicted to cocaine, a habit that would claim the life of his sister. From 1914 to 1916 he took part in the World War I by serving aboard a hospital train organized by the Morozovs. He treated only heavily wounded soldiers and dressed a total of 35000 wounds. By 1916, Vertinsky started to employ a scenic figure of Pierrot, with powdered face, singing miniature novellas-in-song known as ariettas, or \\"Pierrot's doleful ditties\\". Each song contained a prologue, exposition, culmination, and a tragic finale. The novice performer was christened the \\"Russian Pierrot\\", gained renown, became an object of imitation, admiration, vilified in the press and lionized by the audiences. Simultaneously with his booming singing career, he played screen bit parts in Aleksandr Khanzhonkov's silent movies. From that time stems a lifelong friendship with Ivan Mozzhukhin. His famous piece \\"Vashi paltsy pakhnut ladanom\\" (\\"Your Fingers Smell of Frankincense\\") was dedicated to another film star, Vera Kholodnaya. Shortly before the October Revolution Vertinsky devised a stage persona of Black Pierrot and started to tour Russia and Ukraine performing decadent elegies with a touch of cosmopolitan chic, such as \\"Kokainetka\\" and Tango \\"Magnolia\\" (\\"V bananovo- limonnom Singapure\\"). In the words of the American historian Richard Stites, \\"Vertinsky bathed his verses in images of palm trees, tropical birds, foreign ports, plush lobbies, ceiling fans, and \\"daybreak on the pink-tinted sea\\"Richard Stites (1992). Russian Popular Culture: Entertainment and Society Since 1900. Cambridge University Press. p. 14. . — precisely those things which the war-time audience craved for. Career abroad By November 1920, Vertinsky decided to leave Russia with the bulk of his clientele. He performed in Constantinople and toured Romanian Bessarabia, where he was declared a Soviet agent. In 1923, he performed in Poland and Germany, then moved to Paris, where he would perform before the Russian émigré clientele at Montmartre cabarets for nine years. In 1926, Vertinsky made one of the earliest recordings of the song \\"Dorogoi dlinnoyu\\" (\\"Дорогой длинною\\" or \\"Endless Road\\"), written by Boris Fomin (1900–1948) with words by the poet Konstantin Podrevskii,Cover versions of Дорогой длинною by Alexander Vertinsky. SecondHandSongs. Retrieved 17 August 2019. which, with English lyrics by Gene Raskin, was a major hit for Mary Hopkin in 1968 as \\"Those Were the Days\\". After several successful tours in the Middle East, Vertinsky followed the majority of well-to-do Russians to the United States, where he debuted before the audience which included Rachmaninoff, Chaliapin, and Marlene Dietrich. The Great Depression forced him to join the community of Shanghai Russians. It was in China that he met his wife and the oldest daughter, Marianna, was born. Final years In 1943 the Soviet government allowed Vertinsky to return to Russia. Despite lack of media coverage, he performed about two thousand concerts in the USSR, touring from Sakhalin to Kaliningrad. To feed his family, he also appeared in Soviet films, often playing pre-revolutionary aristocrats, as in the screen version of Chekhov's \\"Anna on the Neck\\" (1955). His role of an anti-Communist cardinal in \\"The Doomed Conspiracy\\" even won him the Stalin Prize for 1951. The artist died on 21 May 1957 of heart failure at the Hotel Astoria in Leningrad after giving his last performance. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.Alexander Vertinsky's tomb at the Novodevichy Cemetery website Vertinsky is still influential in Russian musical culture, and has been covered by the likes of Vladimir Vysotsky and Boris Grebenshchikov. There is even an album of electronic lounge covers, by the Cosmos Sound Club. Family Between 1923 and 1941 Vertinsky was married to Irina Vladimirovna Vertidis. While he doesn't mention her in his memoirs, her name could be found in the divorce certificate.Sergei Borovikov. Vitaly Bardadym. Alexander Vertinsky Without Makeup article from Znamya № 1, 1998 (in Russian) From 1942 and till his death Vertinsky was married to the actress and artist Lidiya Vertinskaya (née Tsirgvava, 1923—2013). They had two daughters: Marianna Vertinskaya (born 1943) and Anastasiya Vertinskaya (born 1944), both successful actresses. Marianna was married three times; she has a daughter Alexandra from her first marriage to the Soviet architect Ilya Bylinkin and a daughter Daria from her second marriage to the actor Boris Khmelnitsky. Anastasiya was married to the film director Nikita Mikhalkov from 1966 to 1969 and gave birth to their son Stepan Mikhalkov, also an actor and restaurateur. According to the singer-composer Alexander Gradsky, he was married to Vertinskaya from 1976 to 1978, yet she denied they were ever officially married.

Another brother, Joseph Patrick Conway (1926–1961), joined the firm and in 1961 moved to Illinois to serve as President of Mister Softee of Illinois, Inc., but died a month later in an auto accident in Chicago at age . A fourth brother, the oldest, Monsignor Walter Joseph Conway (1921–2000), was a clergyman with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Their only other sibling, John Conway (1924–1933), died at age . Mister Softee became one of the largest franchisors of soft ice cream in the United States, with about 350 franchisees operating 600 trucks in 15 states. Since 1959, and as of 2016, Mister Softee has been headquartered in Runnemede, New Jersey, and is still owned and operated by members of the Conway family.

Sparks spoke fluent Mandarin and had been teaching English in Suzhou. In 2007, with Alex's help, Sparks launched a Mister Softee China franchise in Suzhou with just one truck. Five years later, Sparks had ten trucks and 25 employees, with plans to expand throughout China's eastern region. Mister Softee China had created a menu that combined classic American ice cream products of shakes, floats, and sundaes with new Chinese products such as green tea ice cream, red bean ice cream, kiwifruit sundaes, and milk tea floats. While its American counterpart operated almost exclusively with trucks, Mister Softee China had kiosks in downtown shopping areas and trucks throughout China's suburban neighborhoods and business districts.

Rather than banning mobile jingles, he permitted the trucks to air them while in transit, but only while in transit. = Trademark infringement tried in New York = Mister Softee has defended its trademarks, notably in the following two cases: * Dimitrios Tsirkos, who until 2014 had for decades been a Mister Softee franchisee in New York, launched a competing ice cream vending company, which was incorporated January 24, 2014, in New York under the name _Master_ Softee Inc., and, among other things, used _Mister_ Softee's jingle. _Mister_ Softee, in 2014, sued Tsirkos in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and prevailed on three allegations: (i) breach of franchise agreements, (ii) trademark infringement, and (iii) other unfair business practices. In 2016, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain held Tsirkos in contempt for failing to begin payments on a $97,000 judgment handed down in the 2014 case. * The next year, Mister Softee won, by default, a Federal lawsuit against Dimitrios Konstantakakos and 3 DDD Ice Inc. – owner of New York Ice Cream Truck Inc. of Long Island City – preventing him from using Mister Softee's jingle. {width=\\"60%\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"border:0px solid #A3B1BF; color: black; background-color:white;\\" -valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text- align:left\\"  width=\\"30%\\"; colspan=3 style=\\"background:#cef2e0; border:1px solid #a3bfb1 \\"   width=\\"30%\\"; colspan=3 style=\\"background:#cef2e0; border:1px solid #a3bfb1 \\"  -valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\"  width=\\"30%\\"; colspan=3 style=\\"background:#cef2e0;\\"   width=\\"30%\\"; colspan=3 style=\\"background:#cef2e0; text-align:right\\"  -valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text- align:left\\"  width=\\"30%\\"; colspan=3 style=\\"background:#cef2e0;\\"   width=\\"30%\\"; colspan=3 style=\\"background:#cef2e0; text-align:right\\"  -valign=\\"bottom\\"   colspan=6 style=\\"background:#cef2e0;\\"  Service Mark Principal Register -valign=\\"bottom\\"   colspan=6 style=\\"color: black; background:#cedff2;\\"  Sensory Mark—No Drawing -valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\"  colspan=3 style=\\"background:#EAEEF2;\\"   colspan=3 style=\\"background:#EAEEF2; vertical- align: middle;\\"  -valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\"  width=\\"30%\\"; colspan=3 style=\\"background:#f5fffa; vertical-align: middle;\\"   width=\\"30%\\";colspan=3 style=\\"background:#f5fffa;\\"  -valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\"  colspan=3 style=\\"background:#EAEEF2;\\"   colspan=3 style=\\"background:#EAEEF2; vertical-align: middle;\\"  -valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\"  colspan=3 style=\\"background:#f5fffa;\\"   colspan=3 style=\\"background:#f5fffa;\\"  -valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\"  colspan=3 style=\\"background:#EAEEF2; vertical-align: middle;\\"   colspan=3 style=\\"background:#EAEEF2; vertical-align: middle;\\"  -valign=\\"bottom\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\"  colspan=3 style=\\"color: black; background:#cef2e0; \\"   colspan=3 style=\\"background:#cef2e0; text-align:left; \\"  } With respect to defending the trademarks, Mister Softee vice president Jim Conway has stated, \\"For 58 years we've spent our time, energy, and money developing brands.

Davis (July 24, 1934 – April 15, 2020) was an American professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL). Davis played college football for the Grambling State Tigers before being drafted 181st in the 1956 NFL Draft. He spent 12 seasons in the NFL, playing for the Cleveland Browns and the Green Bay Packers. In the NFL, Davis was a five-time champion, including winning the first two Super Bowls under Vince Lombardi. Individually, Davis was a six-time All-Pro, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1981.  Biography  = College career = Davis attended college at Grambling State University, where he played football for the Tigers at both offensive tackle and defensive end. = Professional career = Davis was selected with pick number 181 in the 15th round of the 1956 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns, but he did not start his career until the 1958 NFL season due to military service in the United States Army. Davis wore number 77 and played at various positions on both offense and defense for the Browns, before being traded to the Green Bay Packers in 1960. Davis wore number 87 during his career with the Packers, where he was moved to a permanent position at defensive end by Vince Lombardi. For 10 seasons, Davis anchored the Packers' defensive line, playing 138 consecutive regular-season games and part of 162 regular-season games for his NFL career. Davis was a member of all five of Lombardi's NFL title-winning teams and played in Super Bowls I and II. Davis played in an era when neither tackles nor sacks were official statistics. However, John Turney, a member of the Professional Football Researchers Association, reports that Davis had in excess of 100 sacks during his 10-year Green Bay career (1960–69), \\"possibly more than 120,\\" including a minimum of 40 over the 1963–65 seasons alone. Davis himself is quoted as saying, \\"I would think I would have to be the team's all-time leader in sacks. I played 10 years and I averaged in the 'teens' in sacks for those 10 years. I had 25 one season. [Paul] Hornung just reminded me of that the other day.\\" Davis earned All-Pro honors 5 times (1962, 64–67). He was voted to the Pro Bowl five times (1963–67). Davis recovered 21 fumbles over his Packers career, which, more than three decades removed from his retirement, remains a team record. The Packers honored his retirement with a Willie Davis Day on December 21, 1969. Davis served on the team's Board of Directors. = Later life and legacy = In the early 1970s, Davis worked as a color commentator on NFL telecasts for NBC. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1981. In 1986, Davis was named the Walter Camp Man of the Year.

Detailed view of the binding of a volume in the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade. The Album de la Pléiade is a book published every year in May by the \\"Bibliothèque de la Pléiade\\", a series of classic French and international texts by French publishing house éditions Gallimard. It is usually about an author published in the series, although occasionally about a collective from a specific time period (1961 recording and 1989 album) or an important topic of the collection (1970 and 2009 albums). Featured authors are generally chosen upon their entry in the series or a major addition of their works. Each album is richly illustrated and focusses on iconography, with an accompanying bibliographical text by a renowned specialist of the selected author. It is produced in the same format, leather-bound cover and gold lettering as volumes of the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, but has generally fewer pages and is printed on thicker paper to allow the inclusion of many colour images. The Albums are not for sale. They are offered by the booksellers to customers who purchase three books from the collection. They tend to be distributed very quickly and immediately become collectors' items. Because of this, the most popular books of the collection such as, among others, Album Proust (1965), Album Céline (1977) or Album Balzac (1962) can only be obtained on reselling markets at high prices (often found around $200–$300). The older (1960s-1970s) books are also often high priced due to their rarity, even if the author is less popular. The oldest, Dictionnaire des auteurs de la Pléiade (Dictionary of the Authors of the Pléiade), published in 1960 has always been the most expensive, selling for over $400–$450. List of the albums  Here is a list of the Album de la Pléiade:Although the 1960 dictionary and the 1961 record and booklet are precursors, the series was formally started only in 1962, the Balzac album being counted as No. 1 by Gallimard.

The G.T. Andrews-designed station was originally named Paragon Station, and together with the adjoining Station Hotel, it opened in 1847 as the new Hull terminus for the growing traffic of the York and North Midland (Y&NMR;) leased to the Hull and Selby Railway (H&S;). As well as trains to the west, the station was the terminus of the Y&NMR; and H&S; railway's Hull to Scarborough Line. From the 1860s the station also became the terminus of the Hull and Holderness and Hull and Hornsea railways. At the beginning of the 20th century the North Eastern Railway (NER) expanded the trainshed and station to the designs of William Bell, installing the present five arched span platform roof. In 1962 a modernist office block Paragon House was installed above the station main entrance, replacing a 1900s iron canopy; the offices were initially used as regional headquarters for British Rail. A bus station was erected adjacent to the north of the station in the mid 1930s. In the early 2000s plans for an integrated bus and rail station were made, as part of a larger development including a shopping centre; St Stephen's shopping centre, a hotel, housing, and music and theatre facilities. The new station, named \\"Paragon Interchange\\" opened in September 2007, integrating the city's railway and bus stations under William Bell's 1900s trainshed. The station is currently operated by TransPennine Express, which provides train services along with Northern Trains, Hull Trains and London North Eastern Railway. Paragon railway station =Background= In 1840 the Hull and Selby Railway opened the first railway line into Hull, terminating at a passenger and goods terminal, Manor House Street station, adjacent to the Humber Dock, near the old town. Subsequently, the Hull and Selby Railway entered into working arrangements with the Manchester and Leeds Railway and then the York and North Midland Railway. In 1845 an Act of Parliament enabled the York and North Midland and/or the Manchester and Leeds to take a lease of the company with an option to buy the line at a later date – only the York and North Midland was subsequently active. In 1846 the Hull and Selby completed its Bridlington branch which connected from a junction at Dairycoates near Hull to a line the York and North Midland was building from Bridlington to Seamer, connecting to its York to Scarborough Line, forming a railway route from Hull to Scarborough on the east coast.See Hull and Selby Railway, Hull to Scarborough Railway =First railway station, hotel and branches (1848)= The original southern entrance range (2014) In 1846 the York and North Midland and Manchester and Leeds railways began proceedings to create a new terminal station and connecting branch line in Hull.Sources: The \\"York and North Midland (Hull Station), 1847\\" act was subsequently passed. The new station had the advantage of being better situated for travellers, and allowed the old station to be used exclusively for freight traffic. In addition the Hull and Selby company were keen to attract the investment in a new station from the leaseholders, as the capital investment was likely to increase the permanence of the relationship with the lessors. The branches to the station were constructed off the Bridlington branch: a branch turning north-east close to the line's crossing of the Hessle Road;Ordnance Survey. Sheet 240. 1853 and a branch turning south-east at 'Cottingham Junction' near to Haverflatts farm;Ordnance Survey. Sheet 226. 1853 the two branches met at a junction roughly west of the new station. In addition a new connecting chord was made from the Hull and Selby Line, to the Bridlington branch, allowing direct through running from the west into the new station. The station was located on the western edge of the growing Georgian town, and took its name from \\"Paragon Street\\". Construction contracts had been signed by early 1847, before the bill had been formally passed. The station opened in 1847 without any notable ceremony. The station and hotel were both in the Italian Renaissance style, with both Doric and Ionic order elements; the facades show inspiration from the interior courtyard of the Palazzo Farnese. The main station building was aligned east–west, south of the tracks, facing onto Anlaby Road – a two-storey centrally located booking hall was entered via a small porte-cochère, and flanked by 11 bay wide single storey wings, with two storey 3 bay buildings on either end, one a parcels office, the other the station master's house. The train shed contained 5 tracks and 2 platforms, each , covered with a three span iron roof. The station site was nearly . Station Hotel, with original porte-cochère entrance The hotel was in a similar style to the station, located at the east end of the station with its main fascade and entrance facing east. It was completed in 1849 as a three-storey building, 9 bays wide, of area . The centre of the building contained a square lightwell with ground glass roof. Architect for both buildings was G.T. Andrews, and represent his last major commission. The station and hotel were described by some contemporaries as \\"Hudson's Folly\\", who thought the scale of the development too great; the station was the largest built in England to that time associated with a railway station. By the time of completion of the station hotel George Hudson, chairman of the York and North Midland was in disgrace after his fraudulent dealings had been discovered. The hotel's official opening ceremony took place on 6 November 1851. Additional facilities at the station also included a locomotive house, on the west end of north side of the main shed; a coal depot to the north-west; and a turntable.Ordnance Survey. 1:1056 Town Plan A new engine shed was constructed in the 1860s, and a 20 engine shed was constructed in the mid 1870s. In 1853 Queen Victoria visited the town, and the use of the station hotel given to the corporation for the accommodation of the royal party; a throne room was created on the first floor, and the royal household accommodated on the second. The royal party including the Queen, Albert, Prince Consort and five royal children arrived on the Royal Train on 13 October 1853 at Paragon Station. The visit concluded with a dinner at the hotel on 14 October. =NER period (1854–1923)= The 1904 trainshed (2011) In 1853 the Victoria Dock Branch Line had opened in Hull, connecting the Victoria Dock and a number of stations in Hull on a circular route around the outskirts of the town; the line connected to the existing network at junctions west of the station.Ordnance Survey. 1852-3. Sheets 226, 240 This line was doubled in mid 1864 and brought more trains into Paragon: from the Hull and Hornsea Railway (opened 1864); and from the Hull and Holderness Railway (opened 1854) via a connecting chord to the Victoria Dock Branch Line. Further developments in the 1860s created additional or shorted routes into Paragon; the York to Beverley Line was completed in 1865 with the opening of the Market Weighton to Beverley section; the Hull and Doncaster Branch to south Yorkshire in 1869; and the line to Leeds extension was completed, extending the line from Hull to Leeds to the city centre, and allowing through running westward. Entrance hall and booking office, with inlaid \\"NER\\" mosaic floor monogram (2013) In 1873 the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway obtained running powers into Hull, and passenger trains from that company running to Paragon from August. In 1898/9 the Hull and Barnsley Railway and the NER began work towards constructing a joint dock in Hull (see Alexandra Dock); as part of this cooperation between the two companies the H&BR; gave the NER running powers over its line in Hull, and the NER allowed the H&BR; to run into and use Paragon station. The growth of traffic was accommodated in the mid 1870s by adding a third middle platform to the trainshed; the outer platforms were also lengthened beyond the shed, and short bay platforms added on either side. The cross platform was widened at the expense of the length of the main platforms; the booking office and parcels offices swapped positions, and the middle portico walled up to create greater enclosed space.Ordnance Survey. Town Plans. 1856, 1:1056; 1891: 1:500 In 1884/5 the hotel was also expanded, adding room at first floor level by extending westward across a concourse entrance. In 1887 a station canopy was added over the ends of the departure (southside) platform that extended beyond the shed.Note. The 1891 Ordnance Survey 1:500 OS Town plan shows the locations of the supporting columns. In addition to the standard facilities the increased emigration to the United States in the 19th century led to the construction of an emigrant station, south-west of the main station, in part due to concerns over public health dangers, such as cholera; the station also enabled more efficient handling of the large numbers of emigrants. The station rooms were built in 1871 to the designs of Thomas Prosser, and extended 1881. Because of its historical significance the building is now grade II listed. An extensive enlargement of the station was authorised by the NER board in 1897, as part of the extension programme the station's engine shed facilities were transferred to a new site at Botanic Gardens; the transfer was complete by 1901, and in 1902 work began on the rebuilding of the station; the expansion of the site was northwards towards Colliers Street, and required purchases and demolition of houses south of the street.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 1893, 1910–11 Hull Paragon The main station was enlarged to a design by NER architect William Bell. The extension included a new five span steel platform roof, with a two span roof over the concourse, built by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Co., with the offices resited to the east end of the station, facing the station concourse, together with the adjacent Hotel. Half of the new office spaces was taken up by a tiled booking office, with wooden booking windows, and architectural detailing in faience. The booking office's main entrance faced Paragon Square (Ferensway) accessed under a large iron made porte-cochère. The enlarged station opened 12 December 1904. An additional range of buildings was built to the south-east of the station, to provide stock rooms for the hotel.The diagram in notes a bakery and stock rooms, whilst notes a motor garage and stock rooms. To the west and south of the 1848 front another building was built at around the same time (OS. 1:2500 1893, 1910/1) As built the station had nine platforms under the four southernmost spans of the roof; the northernmost span had facilities for special goods, such as cars and horses, and was screened off from the other four; it was served by platform 1, known as the fish dock or fish platform, which was also used for fish. The southern bay platforms, and 1887 platform roof was retained for a total of fourteen passenger platforms; platforms 1–9 also received low level roofs outside the main shed. The original station offices were retained and used as waiting rooms and parcel offices. In 1904 the station signalling system was converted to an electro-pneumatic power signalling system – the station had two signal boxes: Paragon Station box was a 143 lever box and was located at the end of platforms 1 and 2; Park Street box, with 179 levers was located west of the station. On 5 March 1916 during a First World War Zeppelin raid that killed 17, a bomb blast blew out the glass in the station roof. =LNER period (1923–1948)= From 1924 passenger trains running from the Hull and Barnsley Line became able to run into Paragon station with the construction of a connecting chord between the NER and H&BR; networks in north-west Hull. The H&BR;'s Cannon Street station closed in the same year.. See also Hull and Barnsley Railway § \\"As part of the LNER (1923–1948)\\" On 14 February 1927 it was the site of a head-on train collision (see Hull Paragon rail accident) in which 12 passengers were killed and 24 seriously injured, caused by a signalling error.L.T.C. Rolt (1955). Red for Danger, pp. 216–8.Sources:  In 1931–32 the hotel was internally revamped, and expanded by the addition of an extra storey of rooms on the roof, replacing staff bedrooms; and by cement rendered wing on either side of the main entrance; an art deco entrance onto the station concourse was also added. A railway museum was established by Hull Museums director Thomas Sheppard in the station in 1933.Sources: 1930s signal box (2006) In 1935 the decision was made to resignal the station and approaches, replacing the 1904 electro- pneutmatic power signalling system with an electrically operated system. \\"Park Street\\" and \\"Paragon station\\" signal boxes were to be replaced with a single box; the running lines out of the station, including those controlled by the West Parade signal box, were to be track circuited. The system was an early British example of electrical interlocking. 48 points were controlled, using thumb switches in the signal box.The Engineer (8 July 1938) p.49, col.1 Power supply was from the Hull Corporation at 400 V 50 Hz three phase, with a backup generator powered by a Petter oil-engine. The main external system was electrified at 110 V AC, with shunt signals at 100 or 55 V AC; the point motors, previously electro-pneumatically operated were retained, with a per hour max. pressure compressor system, duplicated for redundancy.The Engineer (8 July 1938) p.49, col.2 Signalling was electric lamp backlit.The Engineer (8 July 1938) p.49, cols.2–3 The Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd was the main supplier of the equipment.The Engineer (8 July 1938) p.49, col.3 A new signal box was installed, a LNER type 13, resembling in architectural design the Southern Railway's Streamline Moderne signal boxes, but with square corners. During the Hull Blitz of 1941 the station received direct hits on the night of 7 May, with many incendiary bombs hitting the roof. The signal box was badly damaged when a parachute mine exploded nearby during the same night the station's small railway museum was destroyed by fire. =BR period (1948–1995)= Station entrance with Paragon House above (2003) The main entrance canopy was replaced by an office building Paragon House in 1962. The building was originally used as a regional headquarters for British Rail, but was unused in later years. In 1965 the Newington branch which had been used by trains running from west of Hull to Bridlington and beyond was closed and replaced by a new chord near Victoria crossing. The roofs sheltering platforms 1–9 outside the main shed were removed in the 1970s. In the 1980s a new \\"travel centre\\" (booking and information office) was added on the station concourse. The body of the building was faced with light sandstone, with lighting via semicircular arched windows, and an approximately barrel roofed skylight. In the same period a clerestory roofed waiting room was added at the head of the station platforms, an architectural homage to both Victorian trainshed roofs and clerestory carriages. After the privatisation of British Transport Hotels in the 1980s the \\"Royal Station Hotel\\" was renamed Royal Hotel. =Post privatisation period (1995–present)= In 1990 the hotel was gutted by a fire, the interior was rebuilt and the hotel re-opened in 1992. Station front during redevelopment, after demolition of 'Paragon House' (2006) In 2000 outline planning permission was given for a transport interchange and shopping and leisure complex near Ferensway, Hull; in 2001 full planning documents were submitted for works on a site included a new shopping arcade development incorporating a hotel and car parking facilities; a transport interchange incorporating the station; as well as landscaping, setting out of streets, a petrol station and a housing development. The development also included new facilities for the Hull Truck Theatre and the Albermarle Music Centre. The shopping development is known as St Stephen's shopping centre. The interchange fully opened on 16 September 2007. Features of the railway 2007 station redevelopment include a new canopy to the Ferensway entrance; the \\"Paragon House\\" office block was demolished as part of the redevelopment. The former station booking office area was restored, and in 2009 opened as a community area. From 2009 a mobility scooter hire service was provided at the station. The interior of the booking office is used (2011) as a branch of WH Smith. The new transport interchange was officially opened by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh when they unveiled a plaque on 5 March 2009 after arriving at the station on the Royal Train. A £65,000 bronze statue of Hull resident poet Philip Larkin by Martin Jennings was unveiled on the concourse of Hull Paragon Interchange on 2 December 2010, marking the 25th anniversary of the poet's death. The statue was located near to the entrance to the Station Hotel, a favoured watering place of the poet. In 2011, an additional five slate roundels containing inscriptions of Larkin's poems were installed in the floor around the statue; and in 2012 a memorial bench was installed around a pillar near the statue. In February 2017 a full-size model of the Gipsy Moth aircraft used by Amy Johnson to fly solo from Britain to Australia, created over a six-month period by inmates of Hull Prison, was put on display at the station. This remained throughout the City of Culture but moved to the adjacent St Stephen's shopping centre in March 2018. The station underwent a revamp during 2017, with a £1.4 million investment providing a new waiting area and more retail units. =Station Masters= * William Woodcock * George Akrigg – 1882 * James J.

A new bus station integrated with the main railway station was developed and constructed in the first decade of the 21st century. (see also §Paragon station post privatisation.) Hull Paragon Interchange opened on Sunday 16 September 2007 combining rail and bus station services on a single site. The bus terminal has 38 bus and 4 coach stands, replacing a separate 'island' bus station; the site of the former Hull Bus Station, adjacent to the north of the railway station now forms part of the St Stephen's shopping centre.Ordnance Survey. 1:2500. 1959–70; OS Open Data, The bus ranks are located at the north of the station, in a \\"saw-tooth\\" arrangement. The entrance to the station is from Ferensway, and a reversing roundabout was provided at the west end of the station. The station has approximately 1,700 bus departures per day (September 2010). The area under the northernmost span of the trainshed roof was converted into the concourse and queueing area for the bus station. Services =Bus services= Bus services run from the station to all areas of Hull, as well as to the East Riding and North Lincolnshire. Most city bus services are operated by Stagecoach East Midlands, whilst East Yorkshire Motor Services is the main bus company for services to the East Riding. Services to North East Lincolnshire are operated by Stagecoach East Midlands and Stagecoach Grimsby East Midlands. More distant service include Beverley, York, Scarborough, Withernsea, Humberside International Airport, Scunthorpe, Grimsby and Leeds City bus station. Other, smaller operators include Alpha Bus, and Coach and HCT Group. =Rail services= Hull Paragon is managed by TransPennine Express, serving mainly its North TransPennine route as well as multiple Northern Trains routes. Additional services are provided by Hull Trains and London North Eastern Railway. TransPennine Express operates a Monday-Saturday service of one train per hour to and from Manchester Piccadilly via , and one early morning train to Manchester Airport per day. Direct services to and from Manchester are less frequent after 7pm. In May 2017, a later direct service to Manchester Piccadilly was introduced. On Sunday, a similar service runs at a reduced frequency (approximately every one to two hours), starting later and finishing earlier, with no direct service to Manchester Airport. All services are operated by their Class 185 Desiro's. Northern Trains's weekday service consists of two trains per hour from Hull to , made up of one semi-fast service and one stopping service, with one service per hour continuing through to . Northern also operate one fast service per hour to via plus a second local stopping train each hour to and hourly to both and via Leeds. At peak times there are additional services between Hull and Beverley, that stop at . Weekend running is similar, but with reduced frequencies on some routes and all services finishing earlier. Most fast services from Sheffield call at Hull before continuing to Scarborough, although some timetables show these services as separate rather than continuous.See 2014 Northern Rail Timetables: 28, \\"Hull to Bridlington and Scarborough\\"; 30. \\"Hull to Doncaster and Sheffield\\"; 34, \\"York to Selby and Hull and York to Sheffield via Pontefract Baghill\\" All services are typically operated by a mixture of Class 150 Sprinter's, Class 155 Sprinter's and Class 158 Express Sprinter's. Hull Trains operate a weekday service of seven trains in each direction to London King's Cross. At weekends this service is reduced, with 6 trains on Saturday, and 5 on Sunday. However, Sunday services were be increased to 6 trains in each direction from December 2017. Every day one train to London starts at Beverley progressing onto Hull in the early morning, with one late night train from London terminating at Beverley after Hull. All services are currently operated by Class 802 Paragon's. London North Eastern Railway operate one train per day Monday- Saturday in each direction between Hull and London King's Cross, with the morning service departing Hull at 06:58 and the evening service arriving at Hull at 20:05, which then returns to Doncaster. On Sundays, there is no morning departure with only an evening arrival from London. Each service is operated by a Class 800 Azuma. Platforms * Platform 1 – A bay platform Has been out of use since the mid 90's. Work is scheduled July 2020 to bring it back in to use. * Platform 2 – Northern Trains services on routes to Sheffield from Bridlington or Scarborough or services from York terminating here. * Platform 3 – TransPennine Express services terminating from Manchester Piccadilly along with Platform 4. * Platform 4 – TransPennine Express services from Manchester Piccadilly. * Platform 5 – Northern Trains services terminating from Doncaster and also occasionally used for services from York when platform 2 is in use. * Platform 6 – Northern Trains services from Beverley or services terminating here from Sheffield. * Platform 7 – Hull Trains services from/to London King's Cross/Beverley and Northern services from/to Bridlington/Scarborough terminating or from Doncaster/Sheffield. This platform is also used by London North Eastern Railway's limited service to and from King's Cross, with the platform being just about long enough to accommodate a 9-car Azuma. Naming Early architect's impression of the proposed station and hotel design (south façade) The rail station is commonly known as \\"Paragon station\\", \\"Hull Paragon\\", or just \\"Hull station\\". National Rail refers to the station as \\"Hull\\" (HUL). The name comes from the nearby \\"Paragon Street\\" which was itself built ; the name dates back earlier – The Paragon Hotel public house, (now the \\"Hull Cheese\\") gave its name to the street, and dates back as far as 1700. The station was opened as \\"Hull Paragon Street\\" 8 May 1848 by the York and North Midland Railway; the NER used the name \\"Hull Paragon\\", however the 'Paragon' suffix was inconsistently used over ninety years from opening to 1948. Since the British Railways period (1948) the officially used name has usually been \\"Hull\\", excluded the 'Paragon' suffix. The term \\"Hull (Paragon)\\" has also been used by Network Rail. Since redevelopment in 2007 the official name has been \\"Paragon Interchange\\"; however as of 2012 timetables continued to use \\"Hull\\", except when referring to bus services. The hotel has been known as the \\"Station Hotel\\" or \\"Royal Station Hotel\\" from its early history; after privatisation in the 1980s the owners renamed it \\"Royal Hotel\\". As of 2014, as part of the Mercure Hotels group the hotel's official name is the Mercure Hull Royal Hotel. In popular culture The station has been used as a filming location in the film Clockwise, in an episode of Agatha Christie's Poirot \\"The Plymouth Express\\" and in the comedy Only Fools and Horses – To Hull and Back.

Battles was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968. Early life Battles was born in Akron, Ohio, the son of Frank Battles, a saltworker for the BFGoodrich and Firestone tire companies, and Della Battles. He played high school football at Kenmore High School. Kenmore today honors athletes who carry on Battles' tradition, those who letter in three sports their senior year, with the Cliff Battles Award. Kenmore High School is at the corner of 13th Street and Battles Avenue, but the avenue is not named after Cliff. It was so named before he became famous. College career Battles attended and played college football at West Virginia Wesleyan College. His most prominent season was 1931, when he scored 15 touchdowns and had four extra points. The best game of his college career was also in 1931 in a game against Salem College, when he scored seven touchdowns and had 354 rushing yards, 91 kick return yards, and 24 receiving yards, totalling 469. He acquired the nickname \\"Gip\\" (sometimes spelled \\"Gipp\\") because of his admiration for Notre Dame back George Gipp, the subject of Knute Rockne's \\"win one for the Gipper\\" speech. While at West Virginia Wesleyan, Battles won 15 letters in five sports – four each in football and track, three each in baseball and basketball, and one in tennis. While there, he was a Phi Beta Kappa scholar and Rhodes Scholarship candidate. He was named to the West Virginia Hall of Fame in 1950 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1955. While at West Virginia Wesleyan, Battles also played semipro football for the South Akron Awnings under the name of Jones. Professional career After college, Battles got many offers from NFL teams including the New York Giants and Portsmouth Spartans, among other NFL teams. But he signed with the Boston Braves (now the Washington Football Team) in 1932, who offered him $175 per game, compared with a high of $150 from the other teams. In 1932, Battles won the NFL's rushing title as a rookie. He also performed well during the 1933 season and on October 8, 1933, Battles, playing for the newly named Boston Redskins, became the first player to exceed 200 rushing yards in a game, finishing with 215 yards on 16 rushes and one touchdown against the Giants. In 1937, the Redskins moved from Boston to Washington, D.C. and acquired quarterback Sammy Baugh. For the 1937, Baugh and Battles combined their talents just as everyone had anticipated. During their last regular- season game, Battles scored three touchdowns and the Redskins beat the Giants for the Eastern Division title. In the 1937 NFL Championship against the Chicago Bears a week later, Battles scored the first touchdown in a 28-21 victory that gave the Redskins their first NFL title. In what would end up being his last regular-season game on December 5, 1937, Battles ran for 165 yards against the Giants at the Polo Grounds. This was the record for most rushing yards for a player in the final regular-season game of his NFL career until Tiki Barber broke the record on December 30, 2006 with 234 rushing yards. In the 1937 NFL season, Battles was again the league's leading rusher with 874 yards on 216 carries and won all-league honors for the fifth time in six years. In six seasons, Battles totaled 3,511 yards rushing. A two way threat, he also finished his career with 15 interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown. After 1937, Battles hoped for a raise in salary. George Preston Marshall, the owner of the Redskins, refused to pay him more than $3,000 a year (the amount Battles had been paid since his rookie season). Battles chose retirement instead, and left the game as a player at the end of 1937. Coaching career After the 1937 season, the Battles accepted a $4,000 job as an assistant football coach at Columbia University coached there from 1938 to 1943. While at Columbia, Battles was also the head coach of the men's basketball team from 1942 to 1943. He then served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. After the war, Battles became head coach of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference from 1946 to 1947.

The band was originally formed by childhood friends Mike Sullivan and Dave Turncrantz after their previous musical projects dissolved. After parting ways with their original bass player Colin DeKuiper in 2007, the trio was rounded out by Brian Cook. The band has gained widespread recognition based on a series of critically acclaimed albums and extensive international touring. Their name is taken from a drill exercise used in ice hockey, a sport Sullivan and Turncrantz grew up playing in their original hometown of St. Louis. History Russian Circles was formed in late 2004 by guitarist Mike Sullivan and bassist Colin DeKuiper (both formerly of instrumental band Dakota/Dakota), they quickly recruited drummer Dave Turncrantz, formerly of St. Louis band Riddle of Steel. In the autumn of 2007, it was announced that the band had parted ways with Colin DeKuiper. As a result, the bass tracks on their second album, titled Station, were handled by ex-Botch/These Arms Are Snakes bass player Brian Cook, who then joined the band permanently. The group's third full-length, Geneva, was released on October 20, 2009 and reached No. 24 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. In 2011, Russian Circles signed to Sargent House who had previously only exclusively released the band's albums on limited edition vinyl. Their fourth studio album Empros was released on October 25, 2011. A supporting tour with Deafheaven followed the release. In May, 2013 the group began recording their fifth studio album, produced by Brandon Curtis. Memorial was released at the end of October 2013 and featured a guest-vocal by Chelsea Wolfe. Together they embarked on a co-headlining UK/European tour in the fall. Russian Circles released its sixth studio album Guidance on August 5, 2016 through Sargent House. The album was produced by Kurt Ballou of Converge fame. On August 1, 2019, they released their seventh studio album, Blood Year, recorded at GodCity Studio in Salem and Steve Albini's Electrical Audio Studio in Chicago and again produced by Kurt Ballou.

At the time of its discovery on the Isle of Wight, United Kingdom, it was the best-known large carnivorous dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous period (Hauterivian to Barremian stages) of what is now Europe.Neovenator at Fossilworks.org  Discovery and species  Mounted skeleton and fossils, Dinosaur Isle The first bones of Neovenator were discovered in the summer of 1978, when a storm made part of the Grange Chine collapse. Rocks containing fossils fell to the beach of Brighstone Bay on the southwestern coast of the Isle of Wight. The rocks consisted of a plant debris bed within the variegated clays and marls of the Wessex Formation dating from the Barremian stage of the Early Cretaceous, about 125 million years ago. They were first collected by the Henwood family and shortly afterwards by geology student David Richards. Richards sent the remains to the Museum of Isle of Wight Geology and the British Museum of Natural History. In the latter institution paleontologist Alan Jack Charig determined that the bones belonged to two kinds of animal: Iguanodon and some theropod. The \\"Iguanodon\\", later referred to Mantellisaurus, generated the most interest and in the early 1980s a team was sent by the BMNH to secure more of its bones. On that occasion an additional theropod tail vertebra was discovered. Several amateur paleontologists, among them Keith and Jenny Simmonds, now began to search for additional remains of the predator. Ultimately, the total of secured bones included the snout, teeth, a front lower jaw, most of the vertebral column, ribs, belly ribs, chevrons, the left shoulder girdle, pelvis bones and a hindlimb. These were accessioned under numbers BMNH R10001 and MIWG 6348. They equalled approximately 70% of the skeleton. In 1985, excavations undertaken by Dr Steve Hutt of the MIWG revealed two vertebrae of a second individual, specimen MIWG.5470. In 1987, Jenny Simmonds found a third skeleton, containing vertebra and pelvic bones, specimen MIWG.6352. A fourth individual is represented by specimen IWCMS 2002.186, consisting of a lower jaw, vertebrae and limb elements. In 1990 the material, then considered a possible new species of Megalosaurus, was provisionally described by Hutt. Having mistaken the ischium of MIWG 6352 for a pubic bone, Hutt suggested this specimen represented a separate species. Reconstructed skull in anterior (left) and left lateral (right) views In 1996, Steve Hutt, David Martill and Michael Barker named and described the type species Neovenator salerii. The generic name Neovenator means \\"new hunter\\" from the Greek neo~, \\"new\\" and Latin venator, \\"hunter\\". The specific name salerii honours the land owners of the site, the Salero family. In view of the large number of individuals involved in the discovery process, it was considered improper to single out one of them as discoverer. The holotype is the skeleton accessioned as BMNH R10001 and MIWG 6348. In 1999, Hutt dedicated his (unpublished) master thesis to Neovenator.Hutt, S.C. 1999. Neovenator salerii: A new theropod dinosaur from the Wealden of the Isle of Wight: its status and significance for Theropod evolution. A thesis submitted for the award of degree of Master of Philosophy (unpublished). University of Portsmouth In 2008, Stephen Louis Brusatte, Roger Benson and Hutt redescribed the species in great detail. In 2014, teeth indistinguishable from those of the holotype of Neovenator were found in the Angeac lignitic bone bed, France, dating to the Barremian.  Description  Restoration Neovenator measured approximately in length, and was of a gracile build, weighing . Specimen MIWG 4199 indicates an individual with a possible length of about , but it only consists of a toe phalanx and its position in Neovenator is dubious.Dodson P., Weishampel D. B. & Osmólska H., The Dinosauria, 2nd edition (2004), University of North Carolina Press, p. 104.Brusatte, S. L. and Benson, R. B. J. and Hutt, S. (2008) The osteology of Neovenator salerii (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Wealden Group (Barremian) of the Isle of Wight. Other. Palaeontographical Society, Palaeontographical Society Monographs 162 (631). The various scientific descriptions of Neovenator have indicated some distinguishing traits. The nostril is twice as long as it is high. The praemaxilla in the snout bears five teeth. The maxilla is pierced by a large maxillary fenestra, the diameter of which equals a sixth of the length of the tooth row. The tooth crown equals a quarter of the tooth length, thus including the root. The toe claws have a groove on top. Both praemaxillae are connected by an extra pen-in-socket connection.Naish, D., Hutt S. and Martill, D., 2001, \\"Saurischian dinosaurs 2: Theropods\\". In: Martill D. and Naish D. (eds.), Dinosaurs of the Isle of Wight The Palaeontological Association, pp. 242-309 The front joint surface of the intercentrum of the axis, the second neck vertebra, is transversely widened. The odontoid process of the axis has small openings along the side edge of the front facet. The neural process of the axis has a single small opening in the side. The rear neck vertebrae are fused with their neck ribs. On the eighth and ninth neck vertebrae, at the parapophysis, the lower rib joint facet, the internal camellate structure of the bone is visible. At the front neck vertebrae the undersides are formed as sharp keels which are not inset from the lateral sides. At the front back vertebrae, the hypapophyses, the lower swellings of the front facet edges, are formed like low mounds. On the rear back vertebrae the facets of the joint processes are continued sideways as curved flanges. The shoulder joint is wider transversely than long, measured from the front to the rear. The notch on the underside of the front blade of the ilium has a shelf at the inner side. The \\"feet\\" of the ischia are connected at their fronts but diverge at their rears. The head of the thighbone is obliquely directed to the front, to above and to the inside. On the thighbone the lesser trochanter has a robust ridge on its outer side. On the thighbone the fourth trochanter has a depression in the form of a thumbprint located to the outside of its upper limit. The front underside of the thighbone is nearly flat, only showing a short vertical groove between the lower condyles. The lower shinbone shows an oval rough area at the inner side. The top of the outer malleolus of the shinbone is pinched from the front to the rear. The outer front bulge of the top surface of the shinbone has a spur pointing to below. In the foot, the outer side of the second metatarsal has a hollow surface to contact the third metatarsal. Estimated size based on the holotype Several traits that once were thought to be unique or apomorphic for Neovenator, subsequent research showed to have been shared by other theropods. The nostrils are large but not uncommonly so. Having pneumatised rear back vertebrae is normal for carcharodontosaurids. Elevated paired nasal crests are shared with Allosaurus. Denticles continuing over the tooth apex are today known from other species. In 2015, it was reported that the front of the snout of Neovenator contains a complex system of neurovascular canals, functioning as sensory organs. This trait is also known from Spinosauridae and was there explained as an adaptation for searching prey in water. It was doubted, however, whether Neovenator used its system for the same purpose.Barker, C., Dyke, G., Naish, D., Newham, E. and Katsamenis, O., 2015, \\"Complex neurovascular network in the rostrum of Neovenator salerii\\", SVPCA 2015 abstracts, 78  Classification  At the time that it was described, by Steve Hutt, Martill and Barker in 1996, it was considered the only known allosaurid in Europe. However, further studies suggested it had more in common with the advanced carcharodontosaurid group of allosaurs, and several studies including a detailed examination of the species by Benson, Carrano and Brusatte in 2010 suggest that it is closely related to the Carcharodontosauridae (in a group called Carcharodontosauria), but is actually closer to the megaraptorans, together with them forming the family Neovenatoridae.Benson, R.B.J., Carrano, M.T and Brusatte, S.L. (2010). \\"A new clade of archaic large-bodied predatory dinosaurs (Theropoda: Allosauroidea) that survived to the latest Mesozoic.\\" Naturwissenschaften, 97:71-78 . Other studies have supported Neovenator being a carcharodontosaurid, and megaraptorans being tyrannosauroids. First back vertebra Reconstructed skeleton, World Museum Liverpool The cladogram below follows the 2010 analysis by Benson, Carrano and Brusatte. Cladogram after Novas et al., 2013  Palaeobiology  = Senses = Premaxilla and maxilla, with neurovascular network and CT sections Chris Barker and colleagues suggested that Neovenator may have possessed integumentary sensory organs on its snout, much as modern waterfowl and crocodilians use to find food in muddy water, based on neurovascular structures found on the skull. As Neovenator is believed to be completely terrestrial, unlike the modern species, it is assumed that these sensory organs were used for other purposes, such as sensitivity to pressure and temperature, controlling jaw pressure and precision feeding. In support of this, the tooth wear for Neovenator seems to indicate that it avoided eating or biting into bone while it fed. Additionally, Neovenator might have used these integumentary sensory organs in courtship and sensing nest conditions, a technique seen today in most species of crocodilians and megapode birds. Though such structures are known for another theropod, the tyrannosaurid Daspletosaurus horneri, Neovenators neurovascular structures that likely supported these organs are the best preserved and most complete in any known theropod yet discovered.University of Southampton. \\"Sensitive faces helped dinosaurs eat, woo and take temperature.\\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 27 June 2017 = Palaeopathology = The holotype of Neovenator salerii had many pathologies. The authors of the genus list them as \\"midcaudal vertebrae fusions, healed fractures of mid-caudal vertebra transverse processes; osteophytes affecting pedal phalanges, healed gastralia rib fractures, some forming false joints...

H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 337-363.  Palaeoecology  Fossil remains of Neovenator have been found on the Isle of Wight off southern England, and were first discovered in the 20th century. Neovenator perhaps existed alongside other dinosaurs found in the Wessex Formation of the early Cretaceous period, such as Baryonyx, Polacanthus and Iguanodon. The holotype bones were mixed with those of the plant-eater Mantellisaurus and in the dig site also remains of fishes, amphibians, lizards, pterosaurs and Goniopholididae were present. Neovenator was one of the apex predators of its day.

The first was published in August 1996 and the second in February 1998. At the time, bin Laden was not a wanted man in any country except his native Saudi Arabia, and was not yet known as the leader of the international terrorist organization al-Qaeda. Therefore, these fatāwā received relatively little attention until after the August 1998 United States embassy bombings, for which bin Laden was indicted.Copy of indictment USA v. Usama bin Laden et al., Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Monterey Institute of International Studies The indictment mentions the first fatwā, and claims that Khalid al-Fawwaz, of bin Laden's Advice and Reformation Committee in London, participated in its communication to the press. 1996 fatwā Bin Laden's 1996 fatwā is entitled \\"Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places\\". This document is sometimes called the Ladenese epistle, a term derived from bin Laden's surname. It is a long piece, and complains of American activities in numerous countries. It was faxed to Arab language newspapers internationally but particularly in England.Bergen, Peter, Holy War, Inc., 2001, p. 4 It first appeared in the London-based Arabic paper Al- Quds Al-Arabi. 1998 fatwā The 1998 fatwā reached Al Quds Al Arabi by fax, and was signed by five people, four of whom represented specific Islamist groups: *Osama bin Laden *Ayman al-Zawahiri, \\"emir of the Jihad Group in Egypt\\", probably meaning Islamic Jihad *Ahmed Refai Taha, alias Abu Yasser, of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (in Egypt). This endorsement was retracted because of the enormous unpopularity of terrorism in Egypt following the Luxor massacre of tourists and Egyptians by al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. Taha explained his signature to fellow members of the Islamic Group saying he had only been asked over the telephone to join in a statement of support for the Iraqi people.al- Zayyat, Montasser, The Road to al-Qaeda, The Story of Bin Laden's Right-Hand Man, (University of Michigan Press. 2004. p.89) *Mir Hamzah *Fazul Rahman, \\"emir of the Jihad Movement in Bangladesh\\", probably Harakat ul-Jihad-i- Islami/Bangladesh or HUJI-B; HUJI itself is in Pakistan. The signatories as a group were identified as the \\"World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders\\". This fatwā complains of American military presence in the Arabian Peninsula, the blockade of Iraq, and American support for Israel. It purports to provide religious authorization for indiscriminate killing of Americans and Jews everywhere. It appeared in February 1998 and the embassy bombings followed in August. =World Islamic Front= The World Islamic Front is the organization that issued the World Islamic Front Statement of 23 February 1998, \\"Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders\\",World Islamic Front Statement, The Washington Post, 23 February 1998.Original Arabic text of the fatwa. listing the actions of Americans that they claim conflict with \\"God's order\\", and stating that the Front's \\"ruling to kill the Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it.\\" Terrorism experts consider the \\"World Islamic Front\\" synonymous with al-Qaeda. The 9/11 Commission uses the text of the 23 February 1998 fatwa as evidence that linked Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and al-Qaeda to the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, Washington, D.C., and near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. =Effects of the World Islamic Front Statement= The 23 February 1998 fatwa is the first known official order of the World Islamic Front.

Clarke originally published in 1993. Set in the year 2109, it deals with the discovery of an asteroid to be on course to collide with Earth and depicts the mission for deflecting the asteroid using fusion thermal rockets.  Setting  The main events of the novel start in the year 2109. Descriptions of various aspects of the future society as well as the life of Robert Singh take up a significant part of the book. A world government administers the Earth. Moon and Mars also have established societies. New technologies include automated self-sufficient houses, genetically engineered pets, 'Brainman' (VR with Brain–computer interface), artificial general intelligence, medicine to double human lifespan and extend fertility. The economic policy is guided by \\"the skilful application of Chaos Theory by World Bank mathematicians\\" having caused \\"the collapse of communism and capitalism – now so long ago that both events seemed simultaneous\\". The SPACEGUARD project exists with the goal of detecting and taking care of celestial bodies with potential to impact Earth, with Goliath and Hercules spaceships stationed near Jupiter L4 and L5 as interceptors. Influenced by Islam during military campaigns in the Middle East, an American soldier had evolved into a religious figure and founded the new religion of Chrislam, with a more \\"liberated\\" philosophy compared to Islam and Christianity. The religion capitalized on Brainman technology to spread its teachings as \\"the first Religion of the Byte\\" and became a dominant religion. In 2067, a nuclear bomb was exploded in space (on the other side of the Sun to avoid effect on Earth) to generate powerful radio waves whose echoes were used to identify more of possible impactors for the SPACEGUARD. In 2085, a transmission was received from Sirius, which, while indecipherable, resulted in growth of an extremist faction within Chrislam, 'The Reborn'. The captain of Goliath is Robert Singh, a 70-year-old veteran of spaceflight. While studying for his engineering degree he took part in the first ever marathon in the moon and ended up being the only participant to finish it. His ex-wife and his son from her reside on Earth, while his residence is in Mars, where his wife and his children from her also reside. Aboard the Goliath, Singh and his team are extensively assisted by David, an AI. In the initial sections of the book, three major impact events/meteor bursts are also noted as 'encounters' - 1972 Great Daylight Fireball, Tunguska event and Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event  Plot summary  A new contact binary asteroid is discovered by an amateur astronomer, Dr. Angus Millar, having been missed by the SPACEGUARD due to a combination of factors. It is named Kali and is determined to be on course to hit Earth in about a year's time. Goliath, having been at Jupiter L4, leaves for Deimos to receive the ATLAS propulsion module - designed for attaching with the asteroid and slowly deflecting it to a safe course using nuclear fusion-powered thrusters. Then, having loaded hydrogen fuel at Europa, Goliath reaches Kali and starts the ATLAS. Extremists from The Reborn, believing collision with Kali is meant to be, had planted bombs in the ATLAS and they explode just moments after the activation of ATLAS. However, most of the fuel tanks of ATLAS remain functional and the plan is changed to use Goliath itself to propel the asteroid. Meanwhile, a contingency plan is discussed by Earth's government to use nuclear weapons to break up the peanut shaped asteroid with enough energy that the fragments miss Earth. With Kali getting closer to Sun, it starts ejecting material from vents and is also adjudged to be a probable extinct comet. The resulting venting cancels off a bit of the deflection, taking it too close to the margin of error. Meanwhile Earth's government affirms the usage of nuclear weapons as the success of Goliath's mission isn't deemed certain enough. At Kali, Goliath suffers damage due to the spacecraft sinking a few meters into the asteroid, after weeks of pushing against it. As a result, Goliath loses its fuel and is stuck on the asteroid. With the nuclear weapon plan in effect, the Goliath crew make peace with their upcoming deaths and indulge in pleasure-seeking. The manufacture of nuclear weapons had been abandoned since many years and the weapon intended for Kali is hurriedly put together. When it is fired towards the asteroid, the weapon proves defective and doesn't explode. Though, it impacts with such a high anomalous velocity that the asteroid breaks into two, with Goliath and its crew intact. The part carrying Goliath, Kali 1, stays on course to go safely past Earth, with the crew to be retrieved later by the help of another spaceship. The other part, Kali 2, enters into the Earth's atmosphere. It causes deaths of a hundred thousand people and a trillion dollars' worth of damage. It reaches as close as sixty kilometers above surface, before skipping off the Earth's atmosphere.  Development and writing  In the 'Sources and Acknowledgements' section of the book, Clarke details the inspiration for the novel. Clarke received a request for a short story for Time in May 1992. Having been abreast of NASA's Space-guard survey being conducted in the same year (which in turn borrowed its name from Spaceguard in Rendezvous with Rama), Clarke decided on asteroid impact avoidance as the theme for the short story, with the thought \\"... it was my duty to show what could be done about the asteroid menace. By creating a self- fulfilling prophecy I might even save the world - though I'd never know\\". The short story bearing the same title got published in Time magazine's \\"Beyond the Year 2000\\" issue in October 1992, being the second piece of fiction ever published by the magazine. The Alvarez hypothesis for the K-Pg extinction event, which was only 12 years old at the time, is discussed by Clarke in the section. Clarke also mentions that the 'final confirmation' of the hypothesis only came just before he published the novel. Clarke's decision to 'decompress' the short story into a novel, was influenced by one of Dr. Duncan Steels' visual presentation about 'what might happen in the event of a major impact event'. The choice of time period for the novel (2109) was inspired by the contemporary view that Comet Swift-Tuttle had a high probability of impact with Earth in 2126.  Literary significance and reception  The Library Journal review said that \\"In the capable hands of science fiction veteran Clarke, a standard cosmic disaster plot becomes a lucid commentary on humanity's place in the cosmos\\".  Film adaptation  While filmmaker Steven Spielberg optioned the rights to The Hammer of God for film production, the resultant movie, Deep Impact (1998), was so dissimilar to the book that Clarke received no on-screen credit for the movie.  References to other works  * Clarke reintroduces the idea of project Spaceguard, which he first mentioned in Rendezvous with Rama (1973) as a project to detect near-Earth objects. The Spaceguard featured in The Hammer of God (1993) would seem to be the Spaceguard that exists in the real world, which was inspired by and named after the one in Rendezvous with Rama, as it is remarked to have taken its name from an obscure science fiction novel, and the 9/11/2077 impact that prompted the Spaceguard of Rendezvous with Rama is only mentioned in the book's \\"Acknowledgements and Sources\\". * Goliath's on-board supercomputer is named David and is very similar to HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey.

The film is about a rich young Japanese man (Rikiya Kurokawa), who travels to Australia with the intention of buying a Citroën DS car (the goddess of the film's title - nicknamed the Déesse, after its initials in French, déesse being French for \\"goddess\\") that he has found for sale on the internet. Once there, things do not go as planned and he ends up on a road trip with a blind girl (Rose Byrne). The film was shot in Tokyo and in and around Lightning Ridge in New South Wales, Australia in late 1999.The Goddess of 1967 (2000). Ozmovies. Retrieved 2019-12-21. It won several awards, including Best Actress for Rose Byrne at the 2000 Venice Film Festival and best director at the Chicago Film Festival. The song from the dance scene between BG and JM is Walk-Don't Run (the 1964 version) by The Ventures. The song is not included on the film's soundtrack, which contains the score by Jen Anderson. Plot The Corrugated Iron Church, Lightning Ridge, one of the film's locations The storyline opens in Tokyo where JM (Rikiya Kurokawa), a rich young IT worker and sometime computer hacker, is attempting to purchase a 1967 model Citroën DS, or Goddess, as it is known to French car aficionados. JM lives in a pristine but unfriendly hi-tech apartment. The smog filled city is blue-grey and bleak. He rarely speaks to his live-in girlfriend and is preoccupied with other possessions—his latest snorkeling gear as well as the pet snakes and other exotic reptiles he keeps in the flat. After tracing, on the Internet, a perfectly restored Citroën owned by a couple in Australia, JM abandons his job and flies out to purchase the rare car, which he thinks can fill the emptiness in his life. No one meets JM at the airport but he eventually finds the home where the car is located and meets BG (Rose Byrne), a blind and emotionally unstable young woman. BG, who is minding a young child, explains that the couple did not actually own the Citroën and that the husband shot his wife and then killed himself after a violent argument over money. She shows him the car and tells him, after he has test driven it, that she can take him to its real owner, who is somewhere in the Outback, a five-day drive away. Intoxicated by the vehicle, JM agrees. BG abandons the child at a service station, instructing her not to trust anyone, after calling the police to pick the girl up. As BG and JM journey into the spectacular but harsh landscape, the viewer is taken on a series of complex and often confusing flashbacks which attempt to illustrate the dark tragedies that have shaped their respective lives. JM became fabulously wealthy after a friend gave him the computer password to a major bank. The friend, who claims the reason he is not using the password himself is that he is getting married, is run over and killed by a passing truck. JM's infatuation with the car is apparently an attempt to fill the emotional gap created by his friend's death and the barren life he leads in Tokyo, which, he tells BG, is alien and \\"just like Mars\\". Flashbacks reveal BG was sexually attacked three years earlier by a young boxer from a travelling circus, who is frustrated in his attempts by a Chastity belt. BG then escaped into the bush where she was protected by wild dingoes. As a young child, she was also sexually abused by her grandfather (who is her blood father) and traumatised by Marie (Elise McCredie), her disoriented and deeply religious mother. Grandpa (Nicholas Hope), who was a hippie, a wine maker and then an opal miner, believes his outback existence frees him from all moral constraints. BG's favourite radio show is the obituary notices program and she is infatuated by the sound of insects splattering on the Citroën's windscreen, which, she explains to JM, is the \\"sound of death\\". Although blind, BG carries a pistol which she fires occasionally: the first time at two sinister men who pull alongside the car during JM's test drive and later, in the outback, to destroy the radio she uses to listen to the obituary notices. Unbeknownst to JM, BG's grandfather owns the car and she is leading JM to him not to consummate the car's sale but in order to kill the old man. In the course of their journey through an unremittingly hostile world inhabited by cruel outback men and women, the couple become friends and, after JM teaches BG how to dance, tentative lovers. BG eventually finds her grandfather and confronts him in his rundown opal mine. She had planned to shoot him but, having reconciled her past in the course of the trip and found someone who genuinely cares for her, decides not to go ahead with it. The film ends with BG and JM travelling off together in the Citroën, both having come to terms with their past.

Biography It is impossible now to unravel the intrigues in which he may have engaged, but some facts about his career can be stated. He had long been resident at Calcutta (Kolkata), where he had acquired a large fortune by providing the investment for the British East India Company, and also by acting as intermediary between the English and the local court at Murshidabad. In a letter of Mr. Watts of later date, he is represented as saying to the nawab (Siraj Ud Daulah): : “He had lived under the English protection these forty years; that he never knew them once to break their agreement, to the truth of which he took his oath, by touching a Brahman's foot; and that if a lie could be proved in England upon any one, they were spit upon and never trusted.” Several houses owned by him in Calcutta are mentioned in connection with the fighting that preceded the tragedy of the Black Hole in 1756, and it is on record that he suffered heavy financial losses at that time. He had been arrested by the English on suspicion of treachery, but afterwards he was forward in giving help to the fugitives and also valuable advice. On the recapture of Calcutta, he was sent by Robert Clive to accompany Watts as agent at Murshidabad. It seems to have been through his influence that the nawab gave reluctant consent to Clive's attack on Chandernagore. Later, when the treaty with Mir Jafar was being negotiated circa 1757, he put in a claim for 5% on all the treasure to be recovered, under threat of disclosing the plot. To defeat him, two copies of the treaty were drawn up: the one, the true treaty, omitting his claim; the other containing it, to be shown to him, which Admiral Watson refused to sign, but Clive directed the admiral's signature to be appended. When the truth was revealed to Omichund after Plassey, Macaulay states (following Robert Orme) that he sank gradually into idiocy, languished a few months, and then purportedly died. However, as a matter of fact, he survived for ten years, until 1767; and by his will he bequeathed £2000 to the Foundling Hospital (where his name may be seen in the list of benefactors as “a black merchant of Calcutta”) and also to the Magdalen Hospital in London. Lord Clive testified and defended himself thus before the House of Commons of Parliament on 10 May 1773, during the Parliamentary inquiry into his conduct in India: The Parliamentary history of England from the earliest period to the year 1803, Great Britain Parliament, 1812, web: PG.

The photograph depicts the 14-year-old Vecchio kneeling over the body of Jeffrey Miller, who had been fatally shot by the Ohio National Guard moments earlier. Vecchio had joined the protest while visiting the campus, where she befriended two of the other students hit by gunfire that day: Sandra Scheuer, who was killed, and Alan Canfora, who was wounded in the right wrist. Other photographers captured the scene from other angles. A modification of the photograph was painted by Victor Kalin as cover art for a 12-inch vinyl phonograph record Murder at Kent State, released by Flying Dutchman Records in 1970. The painting makes a cultural statement by adding a National Guard unit in the background. Written commentary by Nat Hentoff places the incident in a context of national malaise.Thomas W. Becker, A Season of Madness: Life and Death in the 1960s(2007) Chapter 9 Biography Vecchio was an Italian immigrant and runaway from Opa-locka, Florida, where she attended Westview Junior High School. After the shootings, she bartered her story to a local reporter in exchange for a bus ticket to California. She was found by police before boarding the bus and sent back to her family, who reportedly later sued T-shirt companies for 40 percent of the profits from sales of apparel featuring Filo's photograph. Following publication of the photograph through the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review satellite paper Valley Daily News and its subsequent pickup internationally, Florida governor Claude Kirk labelled Vecchio a dissident communist. After Vecchio married Joe Gillum in 1979, the couple moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where Vecchio became a clerk at a coffee shop. She later studied massage therapy and is employed as a respiratory therapist. Mary Ann Vecchio meets with John Filo at Kent State University in May 2009, 39 years after the shootings. In 1995, Vecchio and John Filo met for the first time, when both were scheduled to appear at an Emerson College conference commemorating the 25th anniversary of the shootings. She also appeared at Kent State University in May of the same year for the 25th annual commemoration. She returned to Kent State University again for the 36th commemoration in May 2006 and for the 37th commemoration in May 2007. Vecchio has been portrayed in several stage performances depicting the Kent State shootings. The character Vekeero in Halim El-Dabh's 1971 Opera Flies is based on Vecchio. Her role was played by Kelley Lepsik in the 2000 performance of Kent State: A Requiem. Janet Ruth Heller published a poem entitled \\"For Mary Vecchio, August, 1973,\\" which portrays Vecchio as a modern Mary praying for the fallen Kent State students. Before being published, the photograph was retouched to remove the distracting background fencepost that appeared over Vecchio's head in the original image. The unretouched original was stored in the archives of Life magazine.

Edward England (c. 1685–1721)David Marley (2010), Pirates of the Americas: Volume 1, p. 583.Angus Konstam and David Cordingly (2002), The History of Pirates, p. 132. was an Irish-born pirate. The ships he sailed on included the Pearl (which he renamed The Royal James) and later the Fancy, for which England exchanged the Pearl in 1720. His flag was the classic Jolly Roger — almost exactly as the one \\"Black Sam\\" Bellamy used — with a skull above two crossed bones on a black background. Like Bellamy, England was known for his kindness and compassion as a leader, unlike many other pirates of the time. England was born Edward Seegar in Ireland around 1685. He took part in Henry Jennings' expedition for the sunken 1715 Treasure Fleet off the coast of Florida, and then began sailing with Charles Vane in 1718. Upon Vane and other prominent pirates accepting the King's Pardon, England and some of his men sailed for Africa. Along his way he spawned the career of Bartholomew Roberts, among others. In 1720, near the African island of Comoros, England and his men got into a violent conflict with James Macrae. After 10 days of hiding on an island, England and Macrae agreed to a peace deal, upsetting England's crew; he was subsequently voted out as captain and marooned on the island of Mauritius. After four months, England and the loyal crewman that had been stranded with him managed to build a boat and sail to a pirate safe haven in Madagascar. He died sometime in the winter of 1720–21, possibly from tropical disease. Early life Born in Ireland as Edward Seegar sometime around 1685Denis Piat, Pirates and Privateers in Mauritius He was probably raised a Catholic,David F. Marley, Pirates of the Americas, Volume 1 and was said to be an educated man.Marcus Rediker, Villains of All Nations: Atlantic Pirates in the Golden Age Seegar changed his surname to England when he turned pirate. Some sources claim \\"Seegar\\" was not England's name at all, but was instead a separate pirate (Jasper Seagar) who sailed under England. England made his way to Jamaica and during the War of the Spanish Succession he served as a privateer.Angus Konstam, Piracy: The Complete History He was captured by the pirate captain Christopher Winter and forced to join the crew. Winter took England to the pirate base on Nassau, Bahamas. England took part in Henry Jennings' assault on the Spanish salvage camp at Palma de Ayz, Florida, stealing £87,000 in gold and silver.James Kraska,Contemporary Maritime Piracy: International Law, Strategy, and Diplomacy at Sea England is next reported as Charles Vane's quartermaster, in March 1718. Vane's sloop, the Lark was captured by the Royal Navy, but England and the rest of the crew were released to induce the other pirates of Nassau to accept the King's pardon.Colin Woodard (2008), The Republic of Pirates, , p. 234-35. Captaincy – Coast of Africa England was granted captaincy of his own ship in mid-1718. England decided not to accept the pardon along with Vane and a few others, and after the arrival of Woodes Rogers they set sail for the coast of Africa. Along the way he and the crew took several ships. One of the ships was the Cadogan from Bristol, captained by a man named Skinner. Some of England's crew knew Skinner and recognized him instantly because he never paid them for their work previously. According to Charles Johnson, the crew member said: > Ah! Captain Skinner is it you, I am much in your debt, and now I shall pay > you in your own coin. A group of pirates next grabbed the captain, tied him to the windlass and threw empty bottles at him. Next because he had been a good master to his men they gave him a quick death by simply shooting him in the head with a flintlock pistol. Given the crew of the Cadogan was without a captain, England offered them a choice to join his crew. Aboard the crew was Howell Davis who refused to sign the articles of the pirates. Howell said he would rather die than become a pirate, however England refused to kill him and instead gave command of the captured ship to Davis. This began the start of Davis' pirate career. Davis would go on to spawn the career of Bartholomew Roberts as well and the careers of many other pirates. After some time, England and his crew captured a larger brig or frigate named the Pearl. Taking the ship as their own, they renamed it the Royal James and in the spring of 1719 went off in search of plunder in Africa. Between the Gambia River and the Cape Coast, the pirates seized and looted ten ships. Two of these they kept as prizes, granting them to Captains Robert Lane and Richard Sample, who left England to sail for the Caribbean.According to Johnson's \\"General History,\\" the Elizabeth and Katherine was renamed Flying King under Sample; she was run ashore by a man-o'-war off Brazil in November 1720 and her crew captured by the Portuguese. The Mercury was renamed Queen Ann's Revenge (not to be confused with Blackbeard's ship) and given to Lane; after taking several ships it escaped from the man-o'-war that caught Sample but was lost offshore with all hands. After looting the ten ships, England made John Taylor the captain of his next prize, the Victory. After looting two additional ships, England and the crew decided to make port in a small African town. However the pirates grew increasingly belligerent and conflicts arose with the locals over the treatment of women. Soon a fight broke out, resulting in the pirates burning the entire town and departing. While plundering a town in Southern Africa, England saw a beautiful woman by the name of Amy Brionso. He kidnapped her and kept her in his captain's quarters. England comforted her and she slowly began falling in love with him. Years later, the couple married and had a child they named John Edward England. Captain England, concerned for the safety of Amy and their child, left them on the eastern coast of Southern Africa. Before departing, England asked his wife to instruct their son to name his first-born son John, after himself, and expressed his wish that doing so would become family tradition. Indian Ocean An engraving depicting the pirate Edward England with, in the background, the fight of the Fancy (left) and the Cassandra. By 1720, England had reached the Indian Ocean, where he met with fellow pirate Captain Oliver la Buse. England captured a thirty-four gun Dutch ship, which he named Fancy in honour of English pirate Henry Every, and he made the Fancy his new flagship. England decided to attack an East Indiaman under the command of James Macrae, the Cassandra, near the island of Comoros.The same sources which claim Jasper Seagar was a separate pirate from England also place Seagar in command of either the Fancy or the Victory during the battle against Macrae'sCassandra. A long and bloody battle ensued, and both ships ran aground. Macrae and his surviving crew escaped and hid on the island for ten days. Finally Macrae, who was injured, tired, and hungry, went aboard England's consort the Victory, hoping for mercy, and surrendered to the pirates. The cargo of the Cassandra was valued at £75,000. Ninety of the Fancy's crew died in the attack on the Cassandra. England had a good nature and unusual kindness, in that he did not believe in torturing captives unless they could not otherwise be persuaded. England ordered Macrae's life spared, and the pirates kept the Cassandra and gave the heavily damaged Fancy to Macrae. England's quartermaster, John Taylor, who was now captain of the Victory, resented this choice, and only agreed after England got him drunk. England then captured a small English ship near Cochin, the drunk captain reporting a false rumour that Macrae was preparing a fleet to chase the pirates. This enraged the pirates, particularly Taylor, who had wanted to kill Macrae. Around this time, Taylor organised a vote to remove England from command. Marooning in Mauritius Edward England, marooned, from the Pirates of the Spanish Main series (N19) for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes MET DP835029 England was subsequently marooned on Mauritius (known from 1715–1810 as Ile de France) with three other loyal crew members. They were put ashore without adequate provisions, and were forced to scavenge.The Pirates Own Book edited by Charles Ellms One of the men marooned with England who had also defended Macrae was described as \\"a man with a terrible pair of whiskers and a wooden leg, being stuck round with pistols,\\" and is said to have been the model for Robert Louis Stevenson's character Long John Silver, though this is uncertain. After about four months, the men built a small boat and managed to sail to the pirate haven of St. Augustine's Bay in Madagascar.

This tradition continued among England's descendants. Edward England is known today as one of the more humane pirate captains of the Golden Age of Piracy.

He collaborated with Carl Sagan on the 1980 series Cosmos. Rendezvous With Rama was written in 1972 and Clarke had no intention of writing a sequel. Lee turned the Rama series into a more character-driven story following the adventures of Nicole des Jardins Wakefield, who becomes the main character in Rama II, The Garden of Rama, and Rama Revealed. When asked, Arthur C. Clarke said that Gentry Lee did the writing while he was a source of ideas. Lee went on to write three more science fiction novels after Rama Revealed. Two take place in the Rama universe (Bright Messengers, Double Full Moon Night) while one makes several references to it (Tranquility Wars).

With 505 dwellings it is home to about 1,500 people and covers . Historical background Tōgō at the time of his internship with the Samuda Brothers, 1877 The estate is named for the shipbuilding company of the Samuda Brothers, Jacob and Joseph d'Aguilar Samuda, who formerly occupied the site. Admiral Togo did his work experience here in 1877 working on the construction of the Fusō. The estate was designed by Gordon Tait of the Worshipful Company of Masons, and built by Tersons Ltd for the London County Council in two phases, commencing in 1965. Work was completed by the Greater London Council and the estate subsequently became part of the Tower Hamlets council housing stock. Upon completion in 1967, the total cost of construction was £2,879,424 - including the cost of rebuilding the river wall, and the removal of massive concrete foundations on the former ship yard.Cubitt Town: Public Housing, Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs (1994), pp. 539-547.

As a concession to the changing needs of its inhabitants resulting from the increase in car-ownership, the development included an underground parking area composed of 200 garages along with space for motorcycles. In 2004 the Samuda Estate Local Management Organisation distributed a paper calling for the refurbishment of the derelict underground garages as potential business units, with a multi-faith prayer facility, Tower Hamlets Community Recycling Consortium, and a workshop area for Local Labour in Construction.

This involved a high level of resident involvement, which was reflected in the narrative structure which involved the local Community television station having its data hijacked by another organisation. When this becomes generally known, the residents organise a protest which leads to the public mock execution of the ones responsible. The film has been subject to critical attention in transgender studies.“You Have Been Watched”: Dances Between Scrutiny and Transubstantiation in the Viewing of the Transgendered Body on Closed Circuit Television by Doran George accessed 15 June 2008 *It has also been used as a location for a number of films and TV Dramas, including Dirty Pretty Things, England Expects, The Face and Red Light Runners an uncompleted film scheduled to star Harvey Keitel.

Designed by Intamin of Switzerland, the wooden coaster opened to the public on June 11, 2006. Intamin contracted Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) to build the ride, and the coaster's track was prefabricated, allowing for quicker installation and lower construction costs. When it opened, it had the steepest drop of any wooden roller coaster in the world at 76 degrees, until the record was broken by T Express in 2008 by one degree. Overall, its structure height of is ranked fourth, its drop height of is ranked second, and its top speed of is ranked fourth among all wooden roller coasters in the world. It was also the first wooden roller coaster to use a cable lift as opposed to the traditional chain lift. El Toro is the main attraction of the Mexican-themed section, Plaza Del Carnaval. It replaced Viper, a roller coaster that permanently closed following the 2004 season. History El Toro sits on the former site of Viper, which closed in 2004. Everything was removed in early 2005 except for the station. El Toro was announced on September 28, 2005 along with Bugs Bunny National Park, a new themed area for children. It was also announced El Toro would be part of a new themed area known as Plaza del Carnaval. The lift hill was topped off on December 20, 2005. The ride started testing on Memorial Day weekend in 2006. The ride had a surprise opening on June 11 then held its grand opening on June 12. El Toro has several similarities to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, the only part of Viper that was not torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a loading platform in the front and an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit on the other side of the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop. El Toro suffered a malfunction with the lift motor in early August 2013. The motor was sent to Maryland to be fixed.http://www.ultimaterollercoaster.com/forums/roller-coasters-theme- parks/228238 El Toro reopened several weeks later on August 30. Ride experience =Theme= El Toro means \\"The bull\\" in Spanish, which is the theme of the ride. The trains are themed as \\"bulls\\" with bull heads on the front. The ride's queue is surrounded by the Southwestern-style buildings of Plaza del Carnaval, and also has abandoned \\"wagon wheels\\" and Spanish posters along a wall separating the queue from the ride. =Layout= A train on the second hill After departing from the station, the train makes a turn to the left, passing through the ride's structure. It then begins to climb the tall cable lift hill. Once the entire train is on the lift the cable increases its speed to around 13 mph. Once at the top of the lift the speed of the cable gently slows down, but it is barely noticeable on the ride. After cresting the top of the lift, the train briefly travels forward and makes a 180 degree turn to the left. It then drops at a 76 degree angle, reaching a top speed of . As the train reaches the bottom of the drop it comes close to the track above, creating a headchopper-effect. It then travels up a camelback hill followed by a second camelback hill at . It then rises and then travels through a 180 degree downward-banked turn to the right, and up another banked turn to the left. The train goes through a small second hill that speeds past the station and the lakeside. The train then makes another turn and up a smaller hill where riders experience -2 g forces on an ejector airtime hill. After coming down the drop, the train snakes through twists and turns. After coming out of the twister section, the train slows down as it moves through small \\"S\\" curve camelback hills and into the brake run. =Trains= El Toro operates with two trains with six cars per train. Riders are arranged two across in three rows for a total of 36 riders per train. It has a theoretical capacity of 1,200 guests per hour. One train has Kia Soul advertising wrapped onto the train itself. The other train has the classic train design, featuring the bull horns on the front of the train. The trains have padded \\"wings\\" at shoulder level to prevent riders from being thrown too far to the side in the final twister section. El Toro's lapbars are U-shaped - (Commonly known as \\"U-Bars\\".) In 2010, one of the trains was re-themed to endorse Stride Gum. The train was wrapped in Stride Gum advertisements, showing a different flavor of Stride gum on each car. The advertisements remained on the train for the entire 2011 season, but were removed before the start of the 2012 season and replaced with Kia Soul advertising. =Track= Train A in the station The wooden track is approximately in length and the height of the lift is approximately . El Toro is very different from a traditional wooden roller coaster because it uses prefabricated wooden track. It was built and designed by Intamin, who also worked with employees of Rocky Mountain Construction to build the ride. Instead of carpenters cutting, shaping, and laying down the track on site by hand, the track is laser cut in a factory. This means that the track is manufactured to a higher degree of precision than could be achieved by hand. The \\"Plug and Play\\" aspect of the coaster speeds construction of the coaster since track does not have to be completely manufactured on site. In addition, because of the speed of construction, the costs of building the coaster are lowered due to fewer man-hours spent on the construction. The riders are subject to a coaster whose track is as smooth as steel. El Toro is the first Intamin \\"Plug and Play\\" (Pre-Fab) wooden roller coaster in the United States and one of four in the world. The other three are Colossos at Heide Park in Germany, Balder at Liseberg in Sweden, and T Express at Everland in South Korea. Records When El Toro debuted, it broke records as the second- tallest and fastest with the second-longest drop of a wooden roller coaster in the United States. , El Toro has the fourth fastest speed, the fourth-tallest lift, and the second longest drop. Awards and rankings When the ride debuted, it ranked 3rd for \\"Best New Ride of 2006\\" in the Golden Ticket Awards.

ASTRA’s main activities are to represent the industry with government, regulators and the media, advocate policy reforms that promote industry growth, highlight and reward industry achievement, report television ratings and assist the industry to develop. ASTRA was formed in September 1997. Board of directors ASTRA is managed by a representative board of directors. The board is chaired by Tony Shepherd AO, a former president of the Business Council of Australia. Also on the ASTRA Board are Ian Davis, Patrick Delany, Jacqui Feeney, Anthony Fitzgerald, Angelos Frangoupoulos, Richard Freudenstein, Lynette Ireland, Bruce Meagher, Mandy Pattinson, Jon Penn, Ben Richardson and Robi Stanton. ASTRA’s chief executive officer, Andrew Maiden, is an ex-officio member of the board. Members ASTRA members are subscription-based television viewing platforms, independent content providers, technology and communications companies, and organisations from the industries that support subscription media in Australia. Members include platforms Foxtel and more than 20 independent content providers including the major international channel groups Fox Sports, BBC Worldwide Channels, ESPN, The Walt Disney Company, Fox International Channels, Discovery Networks Asia Pacific, NBC Universal, as well a number of technology companies and service providers. Membership is open to all organisations and individuals wishing to support the development of the Australian subscription media industry. Policy ASTRA was formed soon after the arrival of subscription television in Australia to politically organise the industry and give it a voice in public debates about the regulation of media. ASTRA’s stated policy priorities are to: support the development of the subscription media industry; encourage the production of local content for Australian audiences; advocate an open, competitive market that encourages investment and innovation; ensure market intervention is minimal and fair to all participants; and lobby for all media organisations to access public resources on the same terms. The organisation’s most high profile campaign is for the reform of anti-siphoning rules, a provision of the Broadcasting Services Act which regulates the manner in which certain sports broadcast rights may be purchased. The anti-siphoning list provides free-to-air television broadcasters with the exclusive opportunity to purchase the right to broadcast more than 1000 sporting events. ASTRA also manages codes of practice that regulate program content and classification, advertising, privacy, subscriber service obligations and complaints procedures. The ASTRA Codes do not cover issues already the subject of licence conditions for subscription television licensees, including in relation to the broadcast of political material and election advertisements, advertisements relating to medicines and tobacco products, the broadcast of events on the anti-siphoning list, captioning levels and captioning quality, and restrictions on the broadcast of content classified above MA 15+. Investment & Jobs ASTRA conducts an annual survey of the subscription media industry’s investment in local screen production, employment and contribution to Gross Domestic Product. In 2014–15 the survey revealed that the industry invested more than $796 million in local content production, created 8370 jobs, and added $2.083 billion to GDP. Events Between 2002 and 2015, ASTRA managed the annual ASTRA Awards for excellence in subscription television. The awards, which were judged by members of the creative industries, were issued for ten content genres, six individuals, and two channel groups. Past hosts and presenters included Australian television personalities Guiliana Rancic, Jennifer Hawkins, Molly Meldrum, Rove McManus, Deborah Hutton, David Speers, Anthony Callea, Charlotte Dawson, Claudia Karvan, Osher Gunsberg, Alex Perry, Sarah Murdoch, Ruby Rose and Lisa Wilkinson, as well as international personalities Joe Mangoniello (from True Blood) and Kristian Alfonso (from Days Of Our Lives). In November 2015, ASTRA announced it would no longer hold the ASTRAs, folding the awards into the annual AACTA Awards. ASTRA manages an annual conference, an annual breakfast for women in television, along with networking events for women in the industry, awards for industry excellence, a graduate program in partnership with AFTRS, and a leadership program.

Common ice is a crystalline material wherein the molecules are regularly arranged in a hexagonal lattice, whereas amorphous ice has a lack of long-range order in its molecular arrangement. Amorphous ice is produced either by rapid cooling of liquid water (so the molecules do not have enough time to form a crystal lattice), or by compressing ordinary ice at low temperatures. Although almost all water ice on Earth is the familiar crystalline ice Ih, amorphous ice dominates in the depths of interstellar medium, making this likely the most common structure for H2O in the universe at large. Just as there are many different crystalline forms of ice (currently 17+ known), there are also different forms of amorphous ice, distinguished principally by their densities. Formation The production of amorphous ice hinges on the fast rate of cooling. Liquid water must be cooled to its glass transition temperature (about 136 K or −137 °C) in milliseconds to prevent the spontaneous nucleation of crystals. This is analogous to the production of ice cream from heterogeneous ingredients, which must also be frozen quickly to prevent the growth of crystals in the mixture. Pressure is another important factor in the formation of amorphous ice, and changes in pressure may cause one form to convert into another. Cryoprotectants can be added to water to lower its freezing point (like antifreeze) and increase viscosity, which inhibits the formation of crystals. Vitrification without addition of cryoprotectants can be achieved by very rapid cooling. These techniques are used in biology for cryopreservation of cells and tissues. Forms =Low- density amorphous ice= Low-density amorphous ice, also called LDA, vapor- deposited amorphous water ice or amorphous solid water (ASW) is usually formed in the laboratory by a slow accumulation of water vapor molecules (physical vapor deposition) onto a very smooth metal crystal surface under 120 K. In outer space it is expected to be formed in a similar manner on a variety of cold substrates, such as dust particles. Melting past its glass transition temperature (Tg) between 120 and 140 K, LDA is more viscous than normal water. Recent studies have shown the viscous liquid stays in this alternative form of liquid water up to somewhere between 140 and 210 K, a temperature range that is also inhabited by ice Ic. LDA has a density of 0.94 g/cm3, less dense than the densest water (1.00 g/cm3 at 277 K), but denser than ordinary ice (ice Ih). By contrast, hyperquenched glassy water (HGW) is formed by spraying a fine mist of water droplets into a liquid such as propane around 80 K, or by hyperquenching fine micrometer-sized droplets on a sample-holder kept at liquid nitrogen temperature, 77 K, in a vacuum. Cooling rates above 104 K/s are required to prevent crystallization of the droplets. At liquid nitrogen temperature, 77 K, HGW is kinetically stable and can be stored for many years. =High-density amorphous ice= High-density amorphous ice (HDA) can be formed by compressing ice Ih at temperatures below ~140 K. At 77 K, HDA forms from ordinary natural ice at around 1.6 GPa and from LDA at around 0.5 GPa (approximately 5,000 atm). At this temperature, it can be recovered back to ambient pressure and kept indefinitely. At these conditions (ambient pressure and 77 K), HDA has a density of 1.17 g/cm3. Peter Jenniskens and David F. Blake demonstrated in 1994 that a form of high-density amorphous ice is also created during vapor deposition of water on low-temperature (< 30 K) surfaces such as interstellar grains. The water molecules do not fully align to create the open cage structure of low-density amorphous ice. Many water molecules end up at interstitial positions. When warmed above 30 K, the structure re-aligns and transforms into the low-density form. =Very-high-density amorphous ice= Very-high-density amorphous ice (VHDA) was discovered in 1996 by Osamu Mishima who observed that HDA became denser if warmed to 160 K at pressures between 1 and 2 GPa and has a density of 1.26 g/cm3 at ambient pressure and temperature of 77 K. More recently it was suggested that this denser amorphous ice was a third amorphous form of water, distinct from HDA, and was named VHDA. Amorphous ice in the Solar System =Properties= In general, amorphous ice can form below ~130 K. At this temperature, water molecules are unable to form the crystalline structure commonly found on Earth. Amorphous ice may also form in the coldest region of the Earth's atmosphere, the summer polar mesosphere, where noctilucent clouds exist. These low temperatures are readily achieved in astrophysical environments such as molecular clouds, circumstellar disks, and the surfaces of objects in the outer solar system. In the laboratory, amorphous ice transforms into crystalline ice if it is heated above 130 K, although the exact temperature of this conversion is dependent on the environment and ice growth conditions. The reaction is irreversible and exothermic, releasing 1.26–1.6 kJ/mol. An additional factor in determining the structure of water ice is deposition rate. Even if it is cold enough to form amorphous ice, crystalline ice will form if the flux of water vapor onto the substrate is less than a temperature-dependent critical flux. This effect is important to consider in astrophysical environments where the water flux can be low. Conversely, amorphous ice can be formed at temperatures higher than expected if the water flux is high, such as flash-freezing events associated with cryovolcanism. At temperatures less than 77 K, irradiation from ultraviolet photons as well as high-energy electrons and ions can damage the structure of crystalline ice, transforming it into amorphous ice. Amorphous ice does not appear to be significantly affected by radiation at temperatures less than 110 K, though some experiments suggest that radiation might lower the temperature at which amorphous ice begins to crystallize. =Detection= Amorphous ice can be separated from crystalline ice based on its near-infrared and infrared spectrum. At near-IR wavelengths, the characteristics of the 1.65, 3.1, and 4.53 μm water absorption lines are dependent on the ice temperature and crystal order. The peak strength of the 1.65 μm band as well as the structure of the 3.1 μm band are particularly useful in identifying the crystallinity of water ice. At longer IR wavelengths, amorphous and crystalline ice have characteristically different absorption bands at 44 and 62 μm in that the crystalline ice has significant absorption at 62 μm while amorphous ice does not. In addition, these bands can be used as a temperature indicator at very low temperatures where other indicators (such as the 3.1 and 12 μm bands) fail. This is useful studying ice in the interstellar medium and circumstellar disks. However, observing these features is difficult because the atmosphere is opaque at these wavelengths, requiring the use of space- based infrared observatories. =Molecular clouds, circumstellar disks, and the primordial solar nebula= Molecular clouds have extremely low temperatures (~10 K), falling well within the amorphous ice regime. The presence of amorphous ice in molecular clouds has been observationally confirmed. When molecular clouds collapse to form stars, the temperature of the resulting circumstellar disk isn't expected to rise above 120 K, indicating that the majority of the ice should remain in an amorphous state. However, if the temperature rises high enough to sublimate the ice, then it can re-condense into a crystalline form since the water flux rate is so low. This is expected to be the case in the circumstellar disk of IRAS 09371+1212, where signatures of crystallized ice were observed despite a low temperature of 30–70 K. For the primordial solar nebula, there is much uncertainty as to the crystallinity of water ice during the circumstellar disk and planet formation phases. If the original amorphous ice survived the molecular cloud collapse, then it should have been preserved at heliocentric distances beyond Saturn's orbit (~12 AU). =Comets= Evidence of amorphous ice in comets is found in the high levels of activity observed in long-period, Centaur, and Jupiter Family comets at heliocentric distances beyond ~6 AU. These objects are too cold for the sublimation of water ice, which drives comet activity closer to the sun, to have much of an effect. Thermodynamic models show that the surface temperatures of those comets are near the amorphous/crystalline ice transition temperature of ~130 K, supporting this as a likely source of the activity. The runaway crystallization of amorphous ice can produce the energy needed to power outbursts such as those observed for Centaur Comet 29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann 1. =Kuiper Belt objects= With radiation equilibrium temperatures of 40–50 K, the objects in the Kuiper Belt are expected to have amorphous water ice. While water ice has been observed on several objects, the extreme faintness of these objects makes it difficult to determine the structure of the ices. The signatures of crystalline water ice was observed on 50000 Quaoar, perhaps due to resurfacing events such as impacts or cryovolcanism. =Icy moons= The Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) on NASA's Galileo spacecraft spectroscopically mapped the surface ice of the Jovian satellites Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The temperatures of these moons range from 90–160 K, warm enough that amorphous ice is expected to crystallize on relatively short timescales. However, it was found that Europa has primarily amorphous ice, Ganymede has both amorphous and crystalline ice, and Callisto is primarily crystalline. This is thought to be the result of competing forces: the thermal crystallization of amorphous ice versus the conversion of crystalline to amorphous ice by the flux of charged particles from Jupiter. Closer to Jupiter than the other three moons, Europa receives the highest level of radiation and thus through irradiation has the most amorphous ice. Callisto is the farthest from Jupiter, receiving the lowest radiation flux and therefore maintaining its crystalline ice. Ganymede, which lies between the two, exhibits amorphous ice at high latitudes and crystalline ice at the lower latitudes. This is thought to be the result of the moon's intrinsic magnetic field, which would funnel the charged particles to higher latitudes and protect the lower latitudes from irradiation. The surface ice of Saturn's moon Enceladus was mapped by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) on the NASA/ESA/ASI Cassini space probe. The probe found both crystalline and amorphous ice, with a higher degree of crystallinity at the \\"tiger stripe\\" cracks on the surface and more amorphous ice between these regions. The crystalline ice near the tiger stripes could be explained by higher temperatures caused by geological activity that is the suspected cause of the cracks. The amorphous ice might be explained by flash freezing from cryovolcanism, rapid condensation of molecules from water geysers, or irradiation of high-energy particles from Saturn. Uses Amorphous ice is used in some scientific experiments, especially in cryo- electron microscopy of biomolecules. The individual molecules can be preserved for imaging in a state close to what they are in liquid water.

Astafjevs won nine Latvian championships with Skonto Riga. He also played abroad for clubs in Austria, England and Russia. At international level, Astaefjevs captained Latvia at UEFA Euro 2004. With 167 caps for his country Astafjevs held the European record for the most international matches played, until being overtaken by Gianluigi Buffon in 2017. He is currently the joint tenth-most capped male footballer in history, alongside Iker Casillas. Club career =Early career= Born in Riga, Astafjevs started his professional career with Skonto Riga in 1992, shortly after Latvia had regained its independence from the Soviet Union. He played there for five seasons, until 1996, becoming a vital first eleven player. They won the league in each of his first four seasons. Twice, in 1995 and 1996, Astafjevs was named the Latvian footballer of the year. In 1995, atypically for a midfielder, he became the top scorer of the league with 19 goals in 28 matches. In 1996, he moved abroad for the first time in his career and joined Austria Vienna in Austria. He played there just for a season and then, in 1997, returned to Skonto. He played there for three seasons, and won three more league titles. He went abroad again in 2000, this time joining Football League Division Two side Bristol Rovers in England. =Bristol Rovers= Astafjevs was signed for Rovers by Ian Holloway, who then managed to persuade authorities to issue him with a work permit. He arrived in the second half of the 1999-2000 season when the club were in second place. His fifth match was away to Oldham Athletic and saw him score and set up two more in an eventual 4–1 win, despite being stretchered off. Rovers fell to seventh by the end of the season, missing the play-offs. The following season had them relegated to the fourth tier for the first time in their history. He scored only twice during the 2001–02 season, but in the following campaign he scored four in the last six league matches to avoid a further relegation. He was then released by manager Ray Graydon.http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/story.html?aid=11283979 =Later career= In 2003, after being released, he returned to Austria and joined Admira Wacker Mödling. In 2004, after the European Championship, having spent one season in Austria, Astafjevs joined the Russian Premier League club Rubin Kazan. Once again he was one of the team's leaders there. Finishing the 2005 season, Astafjevs decided to join Skonto Riga again, where he became the Latvian champion 8 times (previous years of playing also included). In 2007, at the age of 36, he was once again named Latvian footballer of the year. On 9 September 2008, alongside his teammate Marians Pahars, Astafjevs announced his retirement from professional football. After a few days Astafjevs declined this fact, stating he could play for a different club. After the new year it was announced that Astafjevs would play for Olimps/RFS and he would also be the assistant manager alongside Andrejs Štolcers and Mihails Koņevs, whilst the manager of the club would be the Dutch coach Anton Joore.http://f1.sportacentrs.com/futbols/lmt_virsliga/02012009-astafjevs_spelejosais_treneris_olimpa Olimps/RFS then hadn't secured themselves a place in the higher league yet, but there was a possibility if the club merged with another team from Riga. After a half season spent there he joined last season's champions Ventspils, who were completing their squad for the upcoming UEFA Europa League matches.http://sportacentrs.com/futbols/lmt_virsliga/01072009-astafjevs_speles_ventspili Appearing in the tournament's group stages, Astafjevs played only 5 matches there and was released in November 2009. In 2010 Astafjevs returned to Skonto Riga once again and became the Latvian champion with them. After the 2010 season Astafjevs retired from professional football. International career Astafjevs debuted for Latvia at the age of 21 on 26 August 1992, against then- European champions Denmark in qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. From that time he was a vital player in the national team, playing there for 18 years. Astafjevs scored his first international goal on 2 July 1993 on his 14th cap, a friendly 2–0 win over Estonia. In 1999, after the retirement of Vladimirs Babičevs, Astafjevs became the captain of the team. His first match as captain was his 58th in total, against Greece on 31 March in qualification for Euro 2000. On 31 March 2004, he became the first ever Latvian player to play 100 internationals, as they beat Slovenia in an away friendly. As the team's captain, he participated in the Euro 2004 championship in Portugal, playing in all three of Latvia's games. His last international appearance was a friendly match against China on 17 November 2010. There was a special ceremony after the game to honour him. After his retirement, defender Kaspars Gorkšs was elected to be the next captain of the team. =Record= On 14 October 2009, in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Moldova, Astafjevs equalled the European record for the most matches in a national team; Astafjevs went level with the then-record holder Estonian Martin Reim on 157 caps.http://m.apollo.lv/portal/sports/articles/182417 On 15 November 2009, in a friendly match against Honduras, Astafjevs set a new European record with 158 caps. His European record of 167 caps was matched by Iker Casillas and Gianluigi Buffon in June 2016 and November 2016 respectively, and was later broken in March 2017 by Buffon. Coaching career After his retirement from professional football, Astafjevs accepted an offer to become the assistant manager of Skonto Riga. At the start of 2012 he was appointed as the manager of Skonto-2, but was later succeeded by Tamaz Pertia. At the start of 2013 he was selected to be the assistant manager of Latvia national under-21 football team, coached by his former club and international team-mate Marians Pahars. On 11 July 2013, Pahars became the manager of Latvia national football team and chose Astafjevs to be one of his assistants. On 4 June 2014, Astafjevs became the manager of FK Jelgava. In April 2018 Astafjevs left the assistant manager's position of the Latvian national team, following the sacking of head coach Aleksandrs Starkovs. Honours =Club= * Latvian Higher League (9): 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2010 * Latvian Football Cup: 1992, 1995, 1997, 1998 =International= * Baltic Cup: 1993, 1995, 2001, 2003, 2008 =Individual= * Virsliga top scorer: 1995 * Latvian Footballer of the Year: 1995, 1996, 2007 References External links * Latvian Football Federation * Living people 1971 births Sportspeople from Riga Association football midfielders Latvian footballers Latvian people of Russian descent Latvia international footballers Latvian expatriate footballers Latvian expatriate sportspeople in England Latvian expatriate sportspeople in Russia Skonto FC players Latvian Higher League players Bristol Rovers F.C. players English Football League players FC Rubin Kazan players UEFA Euro 2004 players FIFA Century Club FK Austria Wien players FC Admira Wacker Mödling players Russian Premier League players FK Ventspils players Expatriate footballers in Austria Expatriate footballers in England Expatriate footballers in Russia JFK Olimps players Latvian football managers FK Jelgava managers ","title":"Vitālijs Astafjevs"},{"id":"2825639","text":"New Castle Hundred is an unincorporated subdivision of New Castle County, Delaware.

As a congregation of the Church of Scotland, which is Presbyterian, the church is not the seat of a bishop but retains the name due to being, historically, the seat of the Bishop of Caithness. The Cathedral's churchyard is adjoined by Dornoch Castle, the somewhat reconstructed remains of the medieval palace of the Bishops of Caithness. History It was built in the 13th century, in the reign of King Alexander II (1214–49) and the episcopate of Gilbert de Moravia (died 1245) (later Saint Gilbert of Dornoch) as the cathedral church of the diocese of Caithness (moved to Dornoch from Halkirk). William de Moravia (later Sutherland), 1st Earl of Sutherland, was buried in the cathedral in 1248. In 1570, the Cathedral was burnt down by the Mackays of Strathnaver during local feuding. Full 'repairs' (amounting to one of the most drastic over-restorations on any important Scottish medieval building) were not carried out until 1835-37, by the architect William Burn, funded by Countess of Sutherland at a cost of £15,000 (). Among the 'improvements' carried out, the ruined but still largely intact aisled medieval nave was demolished and a new narrow nave without pillars built on its site. In the 17th Century Dornoch ceased to be the seat of the Bishops of Caithness due to abolishment of the episcopate in the Church of Scotland, but the name has remained due this historical association. On 30 September 1866, the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland were present to welcome the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the Duke of Edinburgh, who attended the morning service. The interior was reordered between 1924 and 1926 by Rev. Charles Donald Bentinck, with the removal of Victorian plasterwork to reveal the stonework (although the medieval church would have been plastered throughout). The site of the medieval high altar was raised and converted into a burial area for the Sutherland family, who introduced large marble memorials alien to the original appearance of the building. The previous minister was the Very Rev Dr James Simpson, who was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1994. As of May 2018, the minister (since 1998) was the Rev Susan Brown, who officiated at the wedding of Madonna and Guy Ritchie at nearby Skibo Castle in December 2000. On 9 October 2017, it was announced that she had been nominated as the next Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. She took up the position in May 2018 and served for a year.

It is built next to the sea at the northern part of the Athonite peninsula. Located near the Hilandar monastery, it is the northernmost of all Athonite monasteries. The current monastery dates back to the 10th century, while tradition holds that the site had been used as a monastery since as early as the 5th century. Esphigmenou ranks eighteenth in the hierarchy of the Athonite monasteries and since the early 1970s has been embroiled in legal and ecclesiastical disputes. It is considered amongst the most conservative of the monastic houses on Mount Athos. Name In Greek, the monastery's name literally means tightened, and there are conflicting traditions regarding the origin of the name. One attributes it to the fact that the monastery is built on a stretch of land, tightened by three surrounding hills and the sea. John Comnenus, a 17th-century metropolitan of Drystra, wrote in his book Proskynetarion tou Agiou Orous tou Athonos:Greek: Προσκυνητάριον του Αγίου Όρους του Άθωνος > It is called Esphigmenou because it is restricted by three small mountains, > close to the sea.Stylianos M. Pelekanidēs, The Treasures of Mount Athos: The > monasteries of Iveron, St. Panteleimon, Esphigmenou, and Chilandari > (Ekdotike Athenon, 1974), p. 200Προσκυνητάριον του Αγίου Όρους του Άθωνος, > WorldCat Another tradition attributes the name to a monk who either founded or restored the monastery, recounting that he used to wear a tight rope around his waist, so from him the monastery got its name \\"of the tightened\\". History Athonite tradition attributes the foundation of the monastery to the Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II and his sister St. Pulcheria during the 5th century; the remains of this early monastery, having been subsequently destroyed by a huge rock that fell from the nearby hills, can still be found 500 metres from the existing monastery. However, historical and archaeological evidence cannot safely confirm this tradition and, therefore, the precise time of the monastery's foundation, as well as its founders, cannot be positively identified. The evidence can however confirm that as early as the late 10th or early 11th century the monastery existed. It is mentioned in at least three manuscripts. The monastery is referred to in a letter by Saint Paul of Xeropotamou dating from 1016. The will of the monk Demetrius of Chalki, dating from 1030, is signed by a monk who calls himself \\"Theoktistos monk and abbot of Esphigmenou monastery\\". Finally, the monastery is mentioned in the second Typicon of Mount Athos in 1046. The monastery greatly prospered until the Ottoman conquest. Many Byzantine emperors, such as John V Palaiologos, contributed to this prosperity, as did other Orthodox rulers such as Serbian Emperor Stefan Dušan and Serbian Despot Đurađ Branković. This prosperity was however shrouded by constant disputes over land issues with the neighboring Vatopediou monastery, as well as by many pirate raids and two great fires that damaged the monastery during the 14th century. According to manuscripts held in the monastery's collection, the pirates posed a serious threat to the monastery because the sea near it is usually calm compared to the seas around the rest of the Athonite peninsula. Because of these reasons the monastery was eventually ruined and practically deserted which allowed the nearby monasteries of Hilandar and Zograf to grab various portions of land from it, which led to further legal disputes. However, the monastery managed to recover eventually, as evidenced by a manuscript dated from 1569 that tells of 51 monks working for its reestablishment. In 1655, Czar Alexis I of Russia gave the monks permission to travel throughout his lands every five years to raise funds for the monastery. During the same period the rulers of the Danubian Principalities also made significant contributions to the monastery. During the early 18th century, Bishop Gregory of Melenikon made donations to the monastery and eventually become one of its monks, undertaking a renovation of the monastery. Also, Bishop Daniel of Thessaloniki took care of the monastery's finances and, with the consent of the Athonite community and Patriarch Gerasimus III of Constantinople, made the monastery a cenobium. The relevant patriarchical edict was published in 1797 by Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople, who also rebuilt the southern part of the monastery that had been ruined. A series of competent abbots (Acacius, Euthymius, Theodoritus, and Agathangellus) greatly renovated and expanded the monastery, to the point where the current structures date almost exclusively from their time. The successor of Agathangellus, Lucas, founded an iconographic school, which did great service to the monastery for many years. During the Greek War of Independence, the monastery, being the northernmost on the peninsula, suffered gravely from the Ottoman armies that ravaged Mount Athos. However, during this period, it also experienced some degree of prosperity. During the Macedonian Struggle, the monastery supported the Greek guerillas in their struggle against the Bulgarian komitadjis. Controversy Esphigmenou along with other Mt. Athos monasteries, sketes and monks, had been involved in a long dispute with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The dispute continues since a new \\"Esphigmenou brotherhood\\", was established. The monastic community of Mount Athos is under the direct spiritual jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch and all Athonite monks are canonically required to commemorate (Greek: να μνημονεύουν) the Patriarch. However, since the 1970s, Esphigmenou, along with other Mt. Athos monasteries, had accused the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras of being ecumenist and had refused to commemorate him. These complaints mainly consist of canon law prohibiting Orthodox from praying with heretics. The relationship between the current occupant monks of Esphigmenou monastery and the Ecumenical Patriarchate has greatly deteriorated since 2002, when Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople declared them as being in schism from the Orthodox Church (using a rule that many believe was created to keep Roman Catholics out of the Holy Mountain).The Patriarchical decision Since the Constitution of Greece prohibits schismatics (or Roman Catholics) from dwelling in Athos, the occupants of Esphigmenou were ordered by a Thessaloniki court to leave the monastery, however they refused to comply. The case was taken to the Greek Supreme Court. The Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate reacted by declaring the schismatic monks inside Esphigmenou illegal, and sanctioned the formation of a new Esphigmenou brotherhood, under the spiritual guidance of Archimandrite Chrysostomos Katsoulieris. Esphigmenou again gained global attention in December 2006 when members of the new brotherhood tried to force their way into the monastery's offices in Karyes. In the ensuing clashes seven monks were severely injured.Greek monks clash over monastery, BBC, Wednesday, 20 December 2006 In January 2007, the district attorney of Thessaloniki pressed charges against the monks of Esphigmenou (\\"σχισματικοί ρασοφόροι\\") for \\"embezzlement\\" of over 150,000 euros and the estate rightfully belonging to the monastery. The monks have not given up and remain inside the premises of Esphigmenou as of 2016, under blockade, as shown in a travel documentary by British presenter Simon Reeve. Architecture Procession to the font behind the catholicon for the lesser blessing of waters following the all-night vigil, feast of the Ascension, 1978 The monastery is home to various important structures. Although the monastery was founded no later than the 11th century, the current structures were built mainly during the first half of the 19th century. The general outline of the monastery is a rectangular wall which forms a spacious inner courtyard. In the middle of the courtyard lies the catholicon surrounded by the wings that house the monks' cells, the guest-house and the refectory. The catholicon, which is dedicated to the Ascension of Christ, was built between 1806 and 1810 by the abbot Theodoritos on the site of an earlier catholicon and in the manner of Athonite churches. It was consecrated by Patriarch Gregory V in 1811. The construction of the catholicon was greatly aided by personal donations from Bishop Ignatius of Kassandreia. The temple itself is spacious and majestic and bears eight domes on its lead-covered roof, the central dome being the largest. The marble used for its construction was transported to Athos from Tinos, the place of origin of the church's architect, Paul. The nave of the catholicon was decorated with iconography in 1811 and the sanctuary in 1818 by the iconographers Veniamin, Zacharias and Makarios. The decoration was completed in 1841 with iconography of the narthex by the iconographers Ioasaf, Nikiforos, Gerasimos and Anthimos. The altar, the iconostasis, as well as other features of the temple, date back to this era. The iconostasis in particular, which depicts scenes from the Old and the New Testaments, is carved wood, covered with golden plating and is considered one of the most important post-Byzantine iconostases on Athos. The catholicon also has two chapels, a vestibule and a porch, added in 1845 by Ecumenical Patriarch Anthimus VI of Constantinople, a previous Esphigmenite monk. Outside the southeastern corner of the catholicon there is a font (Greek: Φιάλη), that is used to keep holy water. It was built in 1815 by the abbot Euthymios, at the site of an older similar structure that dated from the time of John V Palaiologos. The structure is roofed by a dome that is held up by eight marble columns, connected by sculpted marble metopes. The refectory is the oldest building in the monastery. It is a semi-detached building in the west wing, across from the catholicon. It is a rectangular building, renovated in 1810 by Abbot Euthymios. Its iconography, dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries still survives, albeit greatly damaged by the fires that the Ottoman soldiers lit to accommodate themselves during their stay in the monastery during the Greek revolutionary war. The monastery also has 13 chapels, eight inside the main complex and five outside. Among the inner chapels, the most important are the chapel of the Presentation of Mary and the chapel of the Archangels at the sides of the catholicon. The other inner chapels are distributed at various sites inside the monastery and contain no frescoes but house important icons. Of the outer chapels, the most notable is the chapel of Saint Anthony of Kiev, the founder of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra -- St. Anthony's life states he became a monk on Athos and Esphigmenou's tradition has his having lived in a secluded cave there overlooking the sea, which is still shown to visitors, and he is commemorated on the feast for All Saints of Esphigmenou -- that lies just across from the monastery. Cultural treasures The monastery's treasury houses many important relics. The treasury, along with the monastery's library are temporarily housed over the catholicon's narthex. Among important cultural treasures, such as crosses, books, garments, etc., Esphigmenou has in its possession a large (3.05×2.80 m) part of Napoleon Bonaparte's tent, which was donated to the monastery by Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople. The monks use this once a year, at the celebration of the Ascension of Christ, as a tent over the entrance of the catholicon. The so-called Cross of Pulcheria lies at the catholicon's altar, which also houses cases of holy relics and a very important Byzantine mosaic icon. The icon is barely 0.15×0.07 m2 and depicts Christ in a standing position in great detail. The icon is surrounded by a silver frame that depicts the apostles, while holy relics are embedded on its lower side. The monastery also has a large collection of manuscripts. Its library houses 372 manuscripts, of which 75 are parchment, some bearing iconographic decoration. Famous among these is the renowned Minologion, coded #14, that bears 80 miniatures. The library also holds a collection of roughly 2,000 printed books, while 6,000 more are housed in another part of the monastery, on the second floor of the northern wing. Administration of Mount Athos The Holy Mountain is governed by the \\"Holy Community\\" (Ιερά Κοινότης) which consists of the representatives of the 20 Holy Monasteries, having as executive committee the four-membered \\"Holy Administration\\" (Ιερά Επιστασία), with the Protos (Πρώτος) being its head. Civil authorities are represented by the Civil Governor, appointed by the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose main duty is to supervise the function of the institutions and the public order. Due to its irregular relations with the patriarchate of Constantinople, the current occupants of Esphigmenou monastery had long not been represented in the \\"Holy Community\\", but presently the new canonical Esphigmenou brotherhood, which is still seeking access to the monastery land, seats a representative.

Stepanovs has played 100 international matches and scored 4 goals for the Latvia national team. He made his debut in 1995, and played at Euro 2004. Club career =Skonto= He started his club career at Skonto-Metāls (later Skonto Riga). He made his debut in senior football at an early age, being just 16 years old. Together with Skonto Riga he won 7 national titles. In 1995, he made his debut for Latvia and soon he became a regular member of the side. While playing with Skonto, Stepanovs played against teams, like Inter Milan, Barcelona and Chelsea. In these games, Skonto and Stepanovs performed well. In 2000, he attracted interest from many European teams. =Arsenal= In 2000, Arsenal captain Tony Adams was injured, prompting Arsène Wenger to sign Stepanovs for a transfer fee of £1.35 million. He started the season well, scoring a goal for Arsenal in a 2-1 League Cup defeat against Ipswich Town on his debut. His playing time grew until a match against Manchester United, when both sides were battling for the Premier League title. Arsenal lost this game 6-1 and their chances of winning the title were hit. After this disappointing performance, Stepanovs played only once again that season in a game against Manchester City. He recovered to make 6 Premier League appearances the following season as Arsenal won the 2001–02 FA Premier League. Six would not normally be enough to earn a medal but he was an unused substitute on the day Arsenal clinched the title against Manchester United at Old Trafford, the scene of his lowest point the season before. Arsenal also won the FA Cup in 2002 and 2003 but Stepanovs was left out of both match day squads. He contributed to their 2002 triumph when featuring in a game against Newcastle United during their run. Overall, he played just 17 times in the league for Arsenal, all of them starts, and 31 times in all competitions. =Later years= After unsuccessful years with Arsenal, Stepanovs was moved to K.S.K. Beveren, which had co-operation agreement with the English club. There he gained back some confidence and he was again in good shape. Stepanovs played well in the Latvian national team, helping it to qualify for Euro 2004 where he played in all of Latvia's three games. After Euro 2004, Stepanovs joined Grasshopper Club Zürich. There he played for 2 seasons, but later he was released. In 2006, he came back to Latvia and played some games for FK Jūrmala. On 26 January 2007 he moved to Danish Premier League side Esbjerg fB on a free transfer, but after just a year he moved to the Russian FC Shinnik Yaroslavl. He was released by Shinnik on 9 July 2008 and in April 2009 he signed for Latvian side RFS/Olimps, but a year later re-joined his previous team FK Jūrmala. He played there for two seasons, with Stepanovs making 25 league appearances, scoring a solitary goal. In August 2011, the player announced his retirement from professional football. On 10 August 2011 Stepanovs was called up to the Latvia national football team for a friendly match against Finland. He played his 100th and last match for Latvia then, and was honoured during the match for his long-term commitment to the national squad. Coaching career During his time at FK Jūrmala, Stepanovs worked as a player/coach assisting the club's manager Vladimirs Babičevs. In March 2012, Stepanovs was appointed as the manager of Latvia national under-17 football team.http://sportacentrs.com/futbols/latvijas_izlase/06032012-u_17_futbola_izlasi_vadis_stepanovs_u19_b Honours Arsenal *Premier League: 2001–02 *FA Cup: 2001–02, 2002–03 Individual *Latvian Footballer of the Year: 2005 References External links Stepanovs International Appearances * Voetbal International * Latvian Football Federation *Stepanov at \\"legioner\\" * 1976 births Living people People from Ogre, Latvia Expatriate footballers in England Latvian footballers Latvia international footballers Skonto FC players Latvian Higher League players Arsenal F.C. players K.S.K.

It is one of the most northerly communities on the Scottish mainland, located several miles to west of Thurso. The largest local employer is the Dounreay nuclear facility. History Built in 1739, the church is a T-shaped church, and is protected as a category A listed building. Externally it is painted white. The wooden pulpit is probably original to the church, complete with an old sounding board as a canopy. The pulpit is on the long wall of the church with the people seated facing each other on dark varnished wooden pews along two arms of the 'T' shape; the third part was partitioned off in the 1950s to form a vestry. Sunday services prior to 2006 Union with Strathy and Halladale were held at 10.45am each Sunday, with communion twice yearly (on the last Sunday of April and September), following which they now take place at 11.00 ön The 1st and 3rd Sundays in The Month. In 1989 the church building celebrated its 250th anniversary. The celebrations included a major restoration programme, a visit by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and a visit by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Very Reverend Dr William McDonald. The minister, the Reverend James Dewar, wrote a history of the church, \\"The Old White House of God\\". (now out of print, but available in Thurso library). In 1994 Reay Parish Church was linked with neighbouring Strathy & Halladale Parish Church in Sutherland, being henceforth served by the same minister. The linked parishes are, however, within the Church of Scotland’s Presbytery of Caithness. Since the Reverend James Dewar moved to Edinburgh in 2000 to become minister at Juniper Green Parish Church the linked parishes have been without a permanent minister. In 2006 Reay, Strathy and Halladale parishes were united into one \\"North Coast Parish Church\\" (NCPC), but retaining separate places of worship. The first Minister of NCPC was Rev. Paul R Read BSc MA, who was inducted to the parish on 18 August 2006. Rev. David Macartney BA Hons was inducted as minister of the North Coast Parish on 22 September 2017.

Tchefuncte culture  The area around the river was inhabited by the hunter-gatherer Tchefuncte culture dating back to 600 BCE.Terry L. Jones. The Louisiana Journey. Gibbs Smith; 2007. . p. 82–83.The Native Americans gathered fresh-water clams, fish and crawfish and built shell middens on the river. Their houses were probably temporary circular shelters having a frame of light poles covered with palmetto, thatch, or grass mixed with mud.  Tchefuncte shipyard  During the War of 1812 the Secretary of the Navy William Jones ordered Captain John Shaw to supervise the construction of a shallow-draft Blockship armed with 32 heavy cannons at the shipyard in Madisonville, Louisiana.William S. Dudley. The Naval War of 1812 Vol. 1: 1812: A Documentary History. Government Printing Office; 1985. . p. 663–664. On December 16, 1814 Major General Andrew Jackson wrote a letter to the Secretary of War John Armstrong Jr. demanding that the ship be completed. When the Battle of New Orleans began the vessel was still moored at the Madisonville Naval shipyard unfinished. Madisonville's Tchefuncte River Lighthouse stands resolutely on the Saint Tammany northshore of Lake Pontchartrain. This lighthouse was built in 1837.Brenda Brown Finnegan, Lighthouse Digest.  Lighthouse  In 1837, the Tchefuncte River Range Lights was built to guide vessels across Lake Pontchartrain to the mouth of the Tchefuncte River. The lighting apparatus was supplied by Winslow Lewis and consisted of nine lamps with several fourteen-inch reflectors. The lighthouse was damaged sometime during the Civil War and was repaired in 1867. The U.S. Coast Guard later took control over the lighthouse in 1939 and used an electrical automation system to power the lighthouse. Then in 1999 the local town of Madisonville, Louisiana assumed ownership and the Institute of Museum and Library Services issued a grant for restoring the historical property. The lighthouse survived the Hurricane Katrina and Rita and continues to be an important historical location.  Course  The Tchefuncte rises in northeastern Tangipahoa Parish and initially flows southward; the river is used to define part of the eastern boundary of Tangipahoa Parish and parts of the western boundaries of Washington and St. Tammany Parishes before turning southeastward into St. Tammany Parish, where it passes the city of Covington and the town of Madisonville. It collects its largest tributary, the Bogue Falaya, at Covington and flows into Lake Pontchartrain about south of Madisonville, near the lake's northern extremity. waterfront, viewed here looking north from the drawbridge on LA 22, features outdoor dining along the Tchefuncte River estuary. The Tchefuncte has been designated by the government of Louisiana as a \\"Natural and Scenic River.\\" Fairview-Riverside State Park is located along the river, upstream of Madisonville.  Today In the 19th century it was an important commercial waterway, where building materials and other products of the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain were loaded to be shipped across the Lake to New Orleans.

It is sometimes played as a party game with the 52-card pack, however, it is better as a serious game for four, playing all against all. Other names for this game include Quatre Valets and Stay Away.The New complete Hoyle: the authoritative guide to the official rules of all, p. 288, Albert Hodges Morehead, Edmond Hoyle - 1991 Knaves is a variant and it is also similar to the Austrian and German games, Slobberhannes, Eichelobern and Grasobern.The Oxford guide to card games, David Sidney Parlett, p. 304 Game = Aim = The aim of the game is to avoid capturing any Jacks in tricks, especially the , called Polignac. = Cards and play = Polignac is played with a Piquet pack of 32 cards. However, unless four play, remove the black Sevens. The rank of the cards are: K Q J A T 9 8 7 in each suit. = Playing = The turn to deal and play passes always to the left. The cards should be divided evenly among the players, with the dealer dealing the cards in 2s and 3s. Eldest leads first and the other players follow suit if possible, otherwise they may play any card. The trick is won by the highest card of the suit led, and the winner of each trick leads to the next. There are no trumps. Score The players lose 2 points for capturing the , and 1 for each other Jack captured. The first player to reach an agreed total of penalties, which may be 10 or 20 points, then loses the game. Any player may bid capot before the opening lead is made. This is an undertaking to win every trick. If succeeded, each opponent loses 5 points; if not the bidder loses 5. Eventually, the position of the Ace, common to old French card games, may be changed. If players prefer to make Ace high, penalties should attach to Queens instead of the Jacks. The players may decide to try and take all the tricks in a hand. This is known as general and the player must announce his intention before he leads to the first trick. If he succeeds, all the other players score 5 penalty points. If he fails, the Jacks score 5 penalty points in the usual way against the players who take them.

The aim is to avoid taking the first and last tricks and the Eichelober - the Ober of Acorns. = Grasobern = Grasobern is the Bavarian equivalent of Eichelobern, played with a 32-card Schafkopf pack. The aim is to avoid taking the first and last tricks and the Grasober - the Ober of Leaves. = Knaves = Knaves is played with 3 or more players.

Gore was among the twenty-two men who paid a guinea to enter the inaugural 1877 championship (women did not have a competition until 1884). The 21 matches were spread over five days. The championship was suspended for the weekend so as not to clash with the annual Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lord's Cricket Ground. The scheduled final on Monday was postponed for four days because of rain. Dropping only two sets in four rounds, the 27-year-old Gore reached the final after beating CG Heathcote in the semifinal. Against Marshall, he won in straight sets, 6–1, 6–2, 6–4, in forty eight minutes.2006 Wimbledon Compendium, Alan Little, p.336 Gore collected the first prize of 12 guineas and a silver cup presented by The Field, a sporting magazine.

He lost the Gentleman's Singles challenge round to Frank Hadow 7–5, 6–1, 9–7 and did not compete in the Wimbledon Championships again after that match. Business career Gore joined Pickering and Smith, the property advisory firm of his father-in-law Edmund James Smith who became President of the Surveyors' Institute.

It was shot in Banff National Park and in a \\"town\\" built for the purpose outside Canmore, Alberta.\\"‘Mystery, Alaska’ Sports a Few Surprises\\" by Edvins Beitiks (San Francisco Examiner, 10/1/99) and \\"Jay Roach, Man of Mystery\\" by Joshua Mooney (Entertainment News Wire), both stored online at http://www.maximumcrowe.net/maxcrowe_mapress.html, Retrieved 19-Sep-2013 Plot Sheriff John Biebe, who is married to Donna, is one of the townsfolk who play in \\"the Saturday Game\\"—a weekly hockey game played on an open pond. The entire town, which is hockey-mad, turns out every week to watch. After the game commences, we see young Stevie Weeks in the stands, kissing Marla Burns, daughter of the town's judge. When the judge sees what is going on, he raps Stevie on the head and reprimands them both. Donna arrives with the latest edition of Sports Illustrated, which features an article on the town and the Saturday Game. The article serves also to explain the nature of the Saturday Game, as well as to introduce some of the prominent team members. It also refers to John as being \\"slow in the feet\\", but concludes with a statement that on the ability to skate, the Mystery team rivals any team in the National Hockey League (NHL). That evening, while having supper with his family Judge Burns and his son Birdie get into an argument about the game, with the judge saying that Birdie doesn't play well because he doesn't pass. In an effort to change the subject, Mrs Burns mentions that Price World may be interested in moving in to Mystery, which would threaten all the local businesses. During the next week, John is called into the Mayor's office to be told that he is being dropped from the Saturday game, in favour of Stevie Weeks. Skank Marden and the mayor's wife, Mary Jane, have been having an affair. At the school, where he is a teacher, he protests to her that she should have told him about John Biebe being dropped from the team. The mayor then enters, and Skank expresses his disgust at the decision. John sees Stevie Weeks at the diner and offers him congratulations. John is then called away because Connor Banks, the team's best player, has just shot someone. While Connor is being read his rights, the deputy explains to John what happened. Connor and a rep from Price World named Mr. Walsh got into an argument; Connor fired a shot to frighten him, but the bullet ricocheted and hit the rep in the foot. Mr. Walsh is then seen having his foot treated while swearing angrily about Connor and the town. John is then called away as there is helicopter about to land at the town hall. Charles Danner, the author of the Sports Illustrated article, steps out of the helicopter. In the mayor's office, he explains to the Committee that as a result of his article the NHL suggested that the New York Rangers be brought up to Mystery to play the town's team in a televised exhibition game. At a town meeting called to discuss the matter, the mayor re-introduces Charlie, who although originally from Mystery, seems not to have been very popular. Charlie is also revealed to have once been romantically connected with Donna. Initially feelings about the match are mixed but then Birdie indicates his eagerness to play and the game is given a rousing endorsement. Later John is approached by the mayor, and assumes that he will be invited back onto the team. However, the mayor wants John only to coach: Judge Burns has refused to do so. John says that he doesn’t know how to coach. Connor Banks' arraignment is brought before Judge Burns, with his attorney, Bailey Pruit, accepting a trial date for the following week. Connor informs him that he doesn't want a trial so soon in case he loses, which would mean he would miss the upcoming game. Bailey tells him not to worry because no jury will lock up the town’s star player. At Connor’s trial, Bailey asks the victim, Mr. Walsh what he thinks of Mystery, and asks him to confirm verbatim transcripts that the sheriff had taken at the time, in which he had disparaged the town. The jury delivers a \\"not guilty\\" verdict on Connor Banks. Amid much jubilation, Judge Burns angrily addresses those assembled, telling them that they have exalted the hockey game above what is right, and that they have disgraced themselves and his courtroom. Birdie confronts him in his chambers and tells him he feels that he was always ashamed of his son for staying in town to play hockey, instead of going to college. Before the next Saturday game, the players watch some NHL hockey on TV, and it emerges that the Rangers players are not keen to play the match, which they disparage as a joke. In the evening, crew from Charlie's TV network arrive. They meet with the mayor and John, informing them that they want to call the team the Mystery Eskimos, which they both take offence to. While John is arguing with Charlie on the street, Judge Burns arrives. John asks him to coach as he doesn’t know how to, but the Judge turns him down. Preparations for the match continue, with it becoming obvious that it is now becoming much more than a game of pond hockey. The mayor and his wife Mary Jane are discussing the forthcoming game, when he finds a locket which he realizes is Skank's. He confronts Mary Jane, and says, \\"Skank Marden has been in this bed.\\" They fight, but some days later they reconcile. When the mayor meets Charlie the next morning, Charlie tells him that the Rangers players had filed a grievance with their players' union, and are no longer coming. The mayor punches Charlie, giving him a bloody nose. Judge Burns meets Bailey and tells him that there is a hearing in New York over the legal dispute. He suggests to him that it might be useful for Mystery to have a presence, and suggests a few legal arguments he could use. At the hearing Bailey makes an impassioned plea for the game to continue. However, while still arguing the case he suffers a fatal heart attack. After the funeral back in Mystery, it is revealed that he won the case, and the game is back on. John confronts the judge, saying that as he sent Bailey to New York he would now have to take over the coaching. The judge agrees, but only if John will come back onto the team as captain. Under the guidance of the judge, the team is seen training frantically for the match. The Rangers' players arrive by helicopter and are greeted by the mayor and townsfolk, who are all amazed at their size. John is called away to deal with a problem, which is revealed to be Charlie driving drunkenly on a Zamboni. He and John talk, and he reveals his bitterness towards Mystery, which he believes rejected him. John points out to him that bringing the Rangers to Mystery could destroy the town if its team were to lose very badly. During the match, the Mystery team take time to settle, but eventually go ahead two goals to nothing in the first period. One of the goals is scored by Stevie, who impresses the commentators with his speed. In the second period however, the Rangers score five unanswered goals. Birdie costs the team a goal through his desire to “go it alone” when he should have passed. Unwilling to accept defeat, Mystery scores two goals in the third period, including one from a pass that Birdie makes instead of shooting for goal himself. As the clock ticks down, Connor has a chance to level the scores, but his shot hits the crossbar, and the game is over, with the score at 5 – 4 to the Rangers. Both the Mystery team and spectators appear completely deflated, until Judge Burns starts clapping for them, after which even the Rangers players applaud them. The following day the Rangers leave, and it is revealed that both Stevie Weeks and Connor Banks have been given minor league contracts and fly out with the Rangers.

Invisible Network of Kids Ink is an American television sitcom which aired on CBS from October 21, 1996 to May 19, 1997 that starred real-life husband and wife Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen as newspaper journalists, allegedly inspired by the film His Girl Friday. The show was also produced by Danson and Steenburgen. The show was canceled after one season due to lower than expected ratings. The show's pilot was drastically changed and reshot from the original version. Ink was filmed at the soundstages of CBS Studio City in the Studio City area of Los Angeles. Outdoor scenes were usually shot at the small backlot streets of the same studio. Plot Journalists Kate Montgomery and Mike Logan married three months after meeting on the White House lawn. Although the marriage didn't last, there are two common threads between them—their 15-year-old daughter Abby and their all-consuming adoration of the newspaper ink that rubs off on their fingers. While Mike has become one of New York's larger-than-life journalists, Kate's hard-nosed reporting from around the world has earned her an impressive reputation. When Kate accepts a job offer that's just too good to pass up, she becomes the first female managing editor of the New York Sun—and she's now Mike's boss as well. Her staff also includes no-nonsense, seen-it-all police reporter Ernie Trainor; intense and somewhat neurotic financial reporter Alan Mesnick; \\"On the Town\\" columnist Belinda Carhardt, who has a few miles on her; and the newsroom's jaded and judgmental editorial assistant Donna French, who manages to remain ultra-hip in a sea of tweeds and khakis.

Biography Levey was born in Wimbledon, London, and grew up in Leigh-on- Sea, Essex. He attended The Oratory School, a Catholic boarding school near Reading. He was called up for National Service in 1945 and served it largely in Egypt. After demobilisation in 1948 Levey went to Exeter College, Oxford to read English; he graduated with first class honours after only two years' study. In 1951 Levey joined the National Gallery as assistant to the Keeper, Sir Martin Davies. He combined administrative duties with scholarly work, producing his first catalogue, on the Gallery's 18th-century Italian paintings, in 1956. In the 1960s, affordable art books with colour reproductions for the general reader began to appear, and Levey was commissioned to write an overview of Western painting for Thames & Hudson's World of Art series. The resulting book, A Concise History of Painting: From Giotto to Cézanne (1962), remains a classic overview of European art history from the introduction of perspective in Italy to the beginnings of modern art at the start of the 20th century. From 1963 to 1964 Levey was Slade Professor of Fine Art at Cambridge University; his lectures were published as From Rococo to Revolution in 1966. The Early Renaissance, written a year later, is considered another milestone in popular art publishing, and was the first non- fiction work to win the Hawthornden Prize for Literature. Levey became deputy Keeper of the National Gallery in 1966, Keeper in 1968, and Director in 1973. He was knighted in 1981. He relinquished his directorship to care for his wife, the novelist and critic Brigid Brophy, after she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1985; the disease ultimately claimed her life. Brophy and Levey were married in 1954 and had one daughter Kate Levey (b. 1957). Levey was a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association. His memoir, The Chapel is on Fire, recounts his upbringing and was published in 2000.

He was born at Utrera. He took minor orders and was for some time professor at the seminary of Vergara, but he became a convert to the doctrines of the French philosophes, scandalizing his acquaintances by his professions of materialism and his denunciations of celibacy. His writings being brought before the Inquisition in 1792, Marchena escaped to Paris, where he is said to have collaborated with Marat in L'Ami du peuple; at a later date he organized a revolutionary movement at Bayonne, returned to Paris, avowed his sympathies with the Girondists, and refused the advances of Robespierre. He acted as editor of L'Ami des lois and other French journals until 1799, when he was expelled from France; he succeeded, however, in obtaining employment under General Moreau, upon whose fall in 1804 he declared himself a Bonapartist. In 1808 he accompanied Murat, brother in law of Napoléon Bonaparte, to Spain as private secretary; in this same year he was imprisoned by the Inquisition, but was released by Emperor Napoléon I brother Joseph Bonaparte, who appointed him editor of the official Gaceta. In 1813 Marchena retired to Valencia, and thence to France, where he supported himself by translating into Spanish the works of Montesquieu, Rousseau, Voltaire and Volney. The Liberal triumph of 1820 opened Spain to him once more, but he was coldly received by the revolutionary party. He died at Madrid shortly before February 26, 1821. The interest of his voluminous writings is almost wholly ephemeral, but they are excellent specimens of trenchant journalism. His Fragmentum Petronii (Basel, 1800), which purports to reconstruct missing passages in the current text of Petronius's Satyricon, is a testimony to Marchena's fine scholarship; but, by the irony of fate, Marchena is best known by his Ode to Christ Crucified, which breathes a spirit of profound and tender piety.

Most materials show some saturable absorption, but often only at very high optical intensities (close to the optical damage). At sufficiently high incident light intensity, atoms in the ground state of a saturable absorber material become excited into an upper energy state at such a rate that there is insufficient time for them to decay back to the ground state before the ground state becomes depleted, and the absorption subsequently saturates. Saturable absorbers are useful in laser cavities. The key parameters for a saturable absorber are its wavelength range (where it absorbs), its dynamic response (how fast it recovers), and its saturation intensity and fluence (at what intensity or pulse energy it saturates). They are commonly used for passive Q-switching. Phenomenology of saturable absorption Within the simple model of saturated absorption, the relaxation rate of excitations does not depend on the intensity. Then, for the continuous-wave (cw) operation, the absorption rate (or simply absorption) A is determined by intensity I: : (1)~~ ~~ A= frac{alpha}{1+I/I_0} where alpha is linear absorption, and I_0 is saturation intensity. These parameters are related with the concentration N of the active centers in the medium, the effective cross-sections sigma and the lifetime tau of the excitations. Relation with Wright Omega function Wright Omega function In the simplest geometry, when the rays of the absorbing light are parallel, the intensity can be described with the Beer–Lambert law, :(2)~~ ~~ frac{mathrm{d} I}{mathrm{d}z}=-AI where z is coordinate in the direction of propagation. Substitution of (1) into (2) gives the equation :(3)~~ ~~ frac{mathrm{d}I}{mathrm{d}z}=-frac{alpha~ I}{1+I/I_0} With the dimensionless variables u=I/I_0, t=alpha z, equation (3) can be rewritten as :(4)~~ ~~ frac{mathrm{d}u}{mathrm{d}t}=frac{-u}{1+u} The solution can be expressed in terms of the Wright Omega function omega: :(5)~~ ~~ u = omega(-t) Relation with Lambert W function The solution can be expressed also through the related Lambert W function. Let u=Vbig(-mathrm{e}^tbig). Then :(6)~~ ~~ -mathrm{e}^t V'big(-mathrm{e}^tbig)= - frac{Vbig(-mathrm{e}^tbig)}{1+Vbig(-mathrm{e}^tbig)} With new independent variable p=-mathrm{e}^t, Equation (6) leads to the equation :(7)~~ ~~ V'(p)=frac{V(p)}{pcdot (1+V(p))} The formal solution can be written :(8)~~ ~~ V(p)=W(p-p_0) where p_0 is constant, but the equation V(p_0)=0 may correspond to the non-physical value of intensity (intensity zero) or to the unusual branch of the Lambert W function. Saturation fluence For pulsed operation, in the limiting case of short pulses, absorption can be expressed through the fluence :(9)~~ ~~ F=int_{0}^t I(t) mathrm{d}t where time t should be small compared to the relaxation time of the medium; it is assumed that the intensity is zero at t<0 . Then, the saturable absorption can be written as follows: :(10)~~ ~~ A=frac{alpha}{1+F/F_0} where saturation fluence F_0 is constant. In the intermediate case (neither cw, nor short pulse operation), the rate equations for excitation and relaxation in the optical medium must be considered together. Saturation fluence is one of the factors that determine threshold in the gain media and limits the storage of energy in a pulsed disk laser. Mechanisms and examples of saturable absorption Absorption saturation, which results in decreased absorption at high incident light intensity, competes with other mechanisms (for example, increase in temperature, formation of color centers, etc.), which result in increased absorption. In particular, saturable absorption is only one of several mechanisms that produce self-pulsation in lasers, especially in semiconductor lasers. One atom thick layer of carbon, graphene, can be seen with the naked eye because it absorbs approximately 2.3% of white light, which is π times fine-structure constant. The saturable absorption response of graphene is wavelength independent from UV to IR, mid-IR and even to THz frequencies. In rolled-up graphene sheets (carbon nanotubes), saturable absorption is dependent on diameter and chirality. Microwave and Terahertz saturable absorption Saturable absorption can even take place at the Microwave and Terahertz band (corresponding to a wavelength from 30 μm to 300 μm). Some materials, for example graphene, with very weak energy band gap (several meV), could absorb photons at Microwave and Terahertz band due to its interband absorption. In one report, microwave absorbance of graphene always decreases with increasing the power and reaches at a constant level for power larger than a threshold value. The microwave saturable absorption in graphene is almost independent of the incident frequency, which demonstrates that graphene may have important applications in graphene microwave photonics devices such as: microwave saturable absorber, modulator, polarizer, microwave signal processing, broad- band wireless access networks, sensor networks, radar, satellite communications, and so on . . Saturable X-ray absorption Saturable absorption has been demonstrated for X-rays. In one study, a thin foil of aluminium was irradiated with soft X-ray laser radiation (wavelength ). The short laser pulse knocked out core L-shell electrons without breaking the crystalline structure of the metal, making it transparent to soft X-rays of the same wavelength for about 40 femtoseconds.

A Republican from Dallas, Hecht was first elected to the Supreme Court in 1988 and was reelected to six-year terms in 1994, 2000 and 2006. He secured his fifth six-year term on November 6, 2012. He was appointed chief justice by Governor Rick Perry on September 10, 2013, and was sworn into that position by retiring Chief Justice Wallace B. Jefferson on October 1, 2013.http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/09/longtime- justice-nathan-hecht-tapped-to-head-texas-supreme-court.html/ Background Chief Justice Hecht was born in Clovis, New Mexico to a farming family, and graduated from Clovis public schools. He earned his Bachelor of Arts from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, with honors in Philosophy and graduated thereafter cum laude from the Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law. He was a law clerk to Judge Roger Robb of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve. He practiced law in the area of general litigation with the Dallas firm of Locke Purnell Boren Laney & Neely, and was a shareholder in that firm prior to his appointment to the bench. While on the District Court, Chief Justice Hecht was the local administrative judge, presiding over all county and district judges in Dallas County and representing them before other branches of government. He began his judicial service on the 95th District Court of Dallas County, to which he was appointed by Governor Bill Clements, on September 1, 1981, elected in 1982, and re-elected in 1984. In 1986, he was elected to the Texas Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas at Dallas, where he served until his election to the Supreme Court. Throughout his tenure on the Supreme Court, Hecht has been designated to oversee all changes in state court rules. Harriet Miers nomination In the days after the October 3, 2005, nomination of Harriet Miers to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Hecht became nationally known as a strong supporter of White House Counsel Miers based upon his long friendship with her. According to Hecht, he and Miers dated in the past and were members of the same church. Hecht gave 120 interviews in support of the eventually- unsuccessful nomination. The New York Times has reported that, on the day of Miers' nomination, Hecht participated in a conference call with the Arlington Group, a coalition of Christian conservatives, assuring them of her pro-life views. In May 2006, Hecht was admonished by the Texas State Commission on Judicial Conduct for \\"an improper use of his office and position to promote Miers's private interest\\" during the nomination; a three-judge panel exonerated Hecht of the charge after he appealed the decision. In March 2007, Hecht said that he had asked then Texas State Representative Tony Goolsby to propose a bill that would make the state reimburse his $340,000 legal fees acquired from the case before the Texas State Commission on Judicial Conduct. His lawyers had discounted his fees by $167,500. Goolsby withdrew the bill after learning that Hecht had already been reimbursed for the bill through \\"donations.\\" Hecht defended his position by saying, \\"Here is the problem: If judges are sanctioned like this and it's unjust and it's wrong and they want to prove it, they can represent themselves or hire a lawyer that you can't pay for on a judge's salary.\\" He is paid $152,500.http://www.courts.state.tx.us/pubs/AR2006/jud_branch/7-judge- salaries-fy07.pdf In December 2008, he was fined $29,000 by the Texas Ethics Commission in connection with the discount, which the Commission ruled was an improper political contribution.Rauf, David Saleh. Texas chief justice's ethics case dragging into 5th year, Houston Chronicle, December 3, 2013. Hecht has filed an appeal of the decision in Travis County District Court, which removed the fine. The appeal was filed in January 2009 and it began the whole process over again. The case is still pending. Memberships, awards and community service Hecht is a member of the American Law Institute, a member of the Texas Philosophical Society, and a fellow of the Texas and American Bar Foundations. He is on the advisory board of the S.M.U. Law Review and was named Outstanding Young Lawyer in 1984 by the Dallas Association of Young Lawyers. Musically talented, Hecht has played the organ for his non- denominational Christian church. Election of 2012 In the November 6 general election, Hecht polled 4,116,102 votes (53.7 percent), compared to 3,208,479 (41.9) percent for the Democrat Michele Petty. Two minor candidates held the remaining 4.4 percent of the ballots. Hecht lost his own county of Dallas, in which he polled 273,105 votes (40.2 percent), compared to Petty's 382,140 (56.2 percent). However, he won neighboring Tarrant County, which includes Fort Worth. Election of 2014 Hecht, backed by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, easily won re-nomination as chief justice in the Republican primary election held on March 4, 2014. He polled 707,692 (60.5 percent); his challenger, former State Representative Robert Talton of Pasadena in Harris County, received 462,273 votes (39.5 percent). In the November 4 general election, Justice Hecht defeated William Moody, who ran unopposed in the Democratic party primary. With 426,898 primary votes, Moody ran 281,000 below Hecht's Republican primary total. Though Hecht himself has benefited from straight ticket voting for his court position, the justice has called for abolition of master levers for political parties on voting machines in Texas. According to Hecht, on November 8, 2016, > many good judges [such as Laura Parker in Bexar County) lost solely because > voters in their districts preferred a presidential candidate (Hillary Rodham > Clinton carried Bexar County.) in the other party. These kinds of partisan > sweeps are common, with judicial candidates at the mercy of the top of the > ticket. Such partisan sweeps are demoralizing to judges and disruptive to > the legal system. But worse than that, when partisan politics is the driving > force, and the political climate is as harsh as ours has become, judicial > elections make judges more political, and judicial independence is the > casualty.Bruce Davidson, \\"A better way to select, retain Texas judges,\\" San > Antonio Express-News, February 12, 2017, p. F3 Former Chief Justices Wallace Jefferson, Thomas R. Phillips, and John Luke Hill, the last Democrat in the position, have also called for reforms in the selection of judges. Joe Straus, the Moderate Republican Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives has urged that straight ticket voting be abolished for all elections, not just judicial ones.

The event was held on December 13, 1988 from the UIC Pavilion in Chicago. It was the only AWA show to be broadcast on pay-per-view (PPV). The Texas-based World Class Wrestling Association (WCWA; formerly known as World Class Championship Wrestling), women wrestling promotion Powerful Women of Wrestling (POWW), and Memphis- based Championship Wrestling Association (CWA) also provided wrestlers for the show. Twelve matches were contested at the event. The main event was a tag team match, in which The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) fought The Stud Stable (Robert Fuller and Jimmy Golden) to a double disqualification. The penultimate match was the most important match of the event, in which the AWA World Heavyweight Champion Jerry Lawler defeated the WCWA World Heavyweight Champion Kerry Von Erich in a title unification match to unify the WCWA World Heavyweight Championship into the AWA World Heavyweight Championship. The show was poorly received, not a financial success and soon after the WCWA was bought out by Jerry Lawler and Jerry Jarrett and merged with the CWA to become the United States Wrestling Association (USWA). The show was added to the WWE Network in June 2016. Event =Preliminary matches= The opening match of the event was a six- man tag team match in which the Guerrero brothers Chavo Guerrero, Mando Guerrero and Hector Guerrero took on Cactus Jack and Rock 'n' Roll RPMs (Mike Davis and Tommy Lane). Chavo hit a moonsault to Lane for the win. Next, Jeff Jarrett defended the WCWA World Light Heavyweight Championship against Eric Embry. The two reversed several pinfall attempts which ended with Embry pinning Jarrett to win the title. Next, Jimmy Valiant took on Wayne Bloom. Bloom attacked Valiant from behind but Valiant quickly countered by hitting an elbow drop for the win. Next, Iceman King Parsons defended the WCWA Texas Heavyweight Championship against Brickhouse Brown. Brown hit a flying bodypress to Parsons and covered him for the pinfall, assuming that he had won the title while Parsons had put his foot on the bottom rope. Parsons then grabbed a foreign object and hit Brown with it to retain the title. The match was followed by a six-person mixed tag team match pitting The Top Guns (Ricky Rice and Derrick Dukes) and Wendi Richter against Badd Company (Paul Diamond and Pat Tanaka) and Madusa Miceli, where Badd Company's World Tag Team Championship and Richter's World Women's Championship were on the line. Near the end of the match, Madusa held Richter while Tanaka tried to hit a savate kick but Richter ducked and Madusa was accidentally hit with it, allowing Richter to pin Madusa to retain her title. Stipulations for the match said that both the women's title and tag title were on the line but only changed hands depending on who pinned whom. Therefore, Badd Company retained their tag team championship. Next, Greg Gagne took on Ron Garvin for the vacant International Television Championship. The action spilled to the outside of the ring until Gagne went back to the ring before the ten count to win the match and the vacant title. The following match was a Lingerie Battle Royal. Syrian Terrorist won the match. Next, Sgt. Slaughter took on Colonel DeBeers in a Boot Camp match. Slaughter put on a helmet and hit DeBeers with it and applied a cobra clutch for the win. After the match, The Iron Sheik and Shiek Adnan Al-Kaissey attacked Slaughter until the Guerreros made the save. Next, The Samoan Swat Team (Samu and Fatu) defended the WCWA World Tag Team Championship against Michael Hayes and Steve Cox. A brawl broke out between Samu and Fox and several referees tried to break it, allowing Buddy Roberts to hit Hayes with his wallet and Fatu then pinned Hayes to retain the titles. Later, Wahoo McDaniel took on Manny Fernandez in an Indian Strap match. McDaniel touched all four corners to win the match. Fernandez attacked McDaniel after the match until Tatsumi Fujinami made the save. =Main event matches= The title unification match was the major highlight of the event, in which Jerry Lawler's AWA World Heavyweight Championship and Kerry Von Erich's WCWA World Heavyweight Championship were on the line and the match would result in the WCWA title being unified into the AWA title. Near the end of the match, Von Erich applied an Iron Claw on Lawler but the referee stopped the match due to Von Erich's excessive bleeding, rendering him unable to continue and awarding the victory to Lawler, making him the undisputed world champion. The main event of SuperClash III was a tag team match in which The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) took on Robert Fuller and Jimmy Golden. Near the end of the match, Morton and Gibson hit a double dropkick to Golden and attempted to cover him for the pinfall but Fuller interfered and both teams brawled in the ring, leading the referee to disqualify both teams. Reception SuperClash III was very poorly received as the event was not a financial success and Verne Gagne did not pay the visiting talent the agreed amount for their participation, due to low buyrates. Many professional wrestling experts have considered the event to be the downfall of AWA as people refused to work for Gagne for his failure to pay the wrestlers. The most notable criticism came from the AWA World Heavyweight Champion Jerry Lawler, who was not paid for his participation in the event and Gagne ultimately stripped him off the title and buried him on AWA television. Adam Nedeff of 411Mania rated it 4.2 out of 10 stars, considering it a poor event citing \\"Terrible, but not as terrible as I was expecting, which might be the most glowing review anyone ever gave this show.\\" Results References External links * SuperClash 1988 in professional wrestling Professional wrestling in the Chicago metropolitan area ","title":"SuperClash III"},{"id":"2825901","text":"The Sharon Osbourne Show refers to either of two TV chat shows hosted by Sharon Osbourne - the original US version, or the more recent UK (ITV) version.

It was also shown in the UK on Sky One and on cable channel ARENA in Australia. The show was eventually canceled due to poor ratings and scathing attacks by critics as being too focused on Osbourne's family. Due to a disappointing array of guests including several little known actors, actresses and country music performers, Osbourne opted not to renew her contract. UK version (2006) The UK version of The Sharon Osbourne Show aired on ITV in the weekday 5pm slot, and it began on Tuesday 29 August 2006. It was originally going to be named Mrs. Osbourne Presents... ITV commissioned the show to compete with rival Paul O'Grady, after he defected from the company and took his show to Channel 4. After a strong debut of 2.1 million viewers, the show's audience fell to 1–1.5 million, beaten by strong competition from the likes of The New Paul O'Grady Show, The Weakest Link and Neighbours. On 12 October, the show's hope of a recommission suffered as it reached a new low of 948,000 viewers. In April 2007 it was confirmed that the show had been axed and Antony Cotton was to be her replacement.

Although Gómara himself did not accompany Cortés, and had in fact never been to the Americas, he had firsthand access to Cortés and others of the returning conquistadores as the sources of his account. However other contemporaries, among them most notably Bernal Díaz del Castillo, criticised his work as being full of inaccuracies, and one which unjustifiably sanitised the events and aggrandised Cortés' role. As such, the reliability of his works may be called into question; yet they remain a valuable and oft-cited record of these events. Biography Cover of 1555 book He was born at Gómara in 1510 or 1511. He studied at the University of Alcalá and was later ordained priest. After a journey to Rome, at his return in 1540, he entered the service of Hernán Cortés as private and domestic chaplain. He accompanied Cortes on the Algerian expedition and, after the death of his patron, it is known that he was at Valladolid in 1556 or 1557, after which he is supposed to have retired to his native city of Seville where he probably died. With the information given him by the conqueror and other persons who had returned from the New World (he himself cites Gonzalo de Tapia and Gonzalo de Umbria) he wrote his Historia general de las Indias., a work published at Zaragoza in the year 1552. It was translated into French by Martin Fumée and published at Paris in 1578; Augustin Gravaliz translated it into Italian and published it at Venice in 1560; lastly, Juan Bautista de San Anton Chimalpain Quauhtlehuanitzin translated it into Nahuatl. The author relates in the first part, which is dedicated \\"To Don Carlos, Emperor of Romans, King of Spain, Lord of the Indies and New World\\", the whole discovery and conquest of the Antilles, Peru (up to the pacification effected by Pedro de la Gasca), Chile and Central America, also the voyage of Magellan and the discovery of the Moluccas. In the second part he tells of the conquest of Mexico, and it is dedicated \\"To the very llustrious Lord Don Martin Cortés, Marques del Valle\\"—the son and heir of the conqueror. Whether through the desire to aggrandize his patron, or through relying on the firsthand information which the latter gave him (Gómara was never in America) or from malice, or for some other reason Gómara fell into serious errors and in many instances sinned gravely against historical truth. It was perhaps for this reason that Prince Philip (afterwards Philip II of Spain), in a decree issued at Valladolid on November 17, 1553, ordered all the copies of his work that could be found to be gathered in and imposed a penalty of 200,000 maravedis on anyone who should reprint it. This prohibition was removed in 1727 through the efforts of Andreas Gonzalez Martial who included Gómara's work in his collection of early historians of the New World (Coleccion de historiadores primitivos de las Indias Occidentales). The Verdadera historia de la Conquesta de Nueva Espana (\\"True History of the Conquest of New Spain\\") of Bernal Díaz del Castillo, a companion of Hernán Cortés, was written to refute Gómara. The latter's style is concise and agreeable, the narrative running on rapidly and gracefully, all of which has had the effect of attracting readers to the work. Among other works of his which have remained unpublished are Batallas de mar de nuestros tiempos (\\"Contemporary Naval Battles\\") and Historia de Harrue y Harradin Barbarroja.

In 1820, Illinois's capital was moved from the flood-prone Kaskaskia in Randolph County, Illinois, on the Mississippi River to Vandalia, on the National Road. Breese was responsible for moving the State Department's records, which he did by wagon. He remained Asst. Secretary of State until the end of the legislative session in 1821, when he returned to Kaskaskia and began a private law practice. =Postmaster of Kaskaskia= U.S. President John Quincy Adams appointed Breese as a United States Attorney at just 27 years old By chance in 1821, he was approached in his law office one day by the Post-Office Department to assume the duties of Postmaster for Kaskaskia. Breese accepted and thereafter earned commissions on postage stamp sales. =Prosecutor= In 1822, Breese was appointed as the Circuit-Attorney for the Third Judicial District in Illinois. He served in that capacity until 1826, when he was removed by the new Governor, Ninian Edwards. In 1827, U.S. President John Quincy Adams, a Whig appointed Breese United States Attorney for the State of Illinois.

Also during this time under the pseudonym R. K. Fleming he edited the Western Democrat. In 1831 he ran for the US congress on a platform favoring transfer of all public lands to each state. Black Hawk War Following the outbreak of the Black Hawk War in 1832, Breese volunteered for military service, enlisting as a private. He was thereafter elected a Major. The battalion assembled at Beardstown, Cass County, Illinois, and marched to the Illinois River near Peru. After arriving at Camp Wilborn, the Lieutenant-Colonel Theophilus W. Smith (a Judge on the Illinois Supreme Court) resigned, and Breese was elected to fill the open position. Under his command were future Civil War General Robert Anderson and future U.S. President Zachary Taylor. Further legal career Following the war, he returned to private practice. In 1833, he was the lead counsel in the defense of Illinois Supreme Court Justice Theophilus W. Smith, whom he had replaced in military command earlier, during his impeachment trial by the Illinois House of Representatives. The defense team also included future-Illinois Governor Thomas Ford and future-U.S. Senator Richard M. Young. Judge Smith remained in office as the legislature failed to achieve a 2/3ds vote required for conviction. Breese also platted an addition to the new town of Chicago, and helped early settler and trader Jean Baptiste Beaubien with his land claim which included the soon- decommissioned Fort Dearborn, which succeeded with the Illinois Supreme Court but was reversed by the United States Supreme Court, despite the efforts of appellate counsel Francis Scott Key and Daniel Webster in Wilcox v. Jackson (1837). =State Judge= Breese opposed John C. Calhoun over tactics during Mexican–American War in the U.S. Senate Following the establishment of the circuit courts in Illinois in 1835, the legislature appointed Breese a judge, responsible for the 2nd Circuit. A case filed in his court in 1838 concerned whether the Governor (then Whig Joseph Duncan) could remove a Secretary of State (Democrat Alexander Pope Field) and appoint another. In a heated partisan atmosphere, Breese delivered a purely legal opinion which upheld the Governor's power. The opinion was appealed to the supreme court, where his opinion was overturned. In retaliation, during the aftermath of the Panic of 1837, Democrats in the state legislature increased the number of judges on the court from four to nine (although the number would again be reduced following the adoption of a new state constitution in 1848), and Breese received one of the new positions. =Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court= In 1841, following the contested legal dispute, Breese assumed the duties as a Justice in the Illinois Supreme Court on February 22. Among the five new appointees to the court made by the legislature, along with Breese, was future-U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas.

As the war raged on, in 1863, Breese proposed radical amendments to the Constitution for the inevitable reconstruction process that would follow the war, one which promised non-interference with slavery. The amendments also included a complete overhaul of the federal election system, including how the President was elected, and enumerating a new power for the Senate to be the court of last resort for states' rights issues or for the constitutionality of a law to be decided. The amendments were presented to the pro-peace Chicago Times for publication, but the editor deemed them too radical. =Author= The transcontinental railroad that Breese had advocated as a Senator was completed.

With its base in Reno, Nevada, the RSIC consists of 1,134 members from three Great Basin tribes: the Paiute, the Shoshone and the Washoe. The reservation lands have been limited, consisting of the original 28-acre Colony located in central-west Reno () and another 1,920 acres put into trust for the tribe in 1984 in Hungry Valley, which is 19 miles north of the Colony and west of Spanish Springs, Nevada, in Eagle Canyon. In November 2016, the Barack Obama administration announced transfer of 13,400 acres of former Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land to the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony. This was achieved under the Nevada Native Nations Lands Act. It authorized the transfer of more than 71,000 acres of BLM and U.S. Forest Service lands into trust status for six Nevada tribes.Alysa Landry, \\"Obama Sets New Standard With Land Into Trust\\", Indian Country Today, 24 November 2016; accessed 26 November 2016 This will provide the tribes with more sustainable bases for their peoples, as well as enlist other parties with an interest in conservation of animals and resources. The RSIC uses both traditional teachings and practices as well as contemporary business methods and governmental practices. The tribe employs more than 300 people, with around half of those being tribal members. History The people who inhabited the Great Basin prior to European settlement were the Numa or Numu (Northern Paiute), the Washeshu (Washoe), the Newe (Shoshone), and the Nuwuvi (Southern Paiute). In each of these groups' language, their autonyms (names for themselves) meant \\"The People.\\" Bands within these groups were often known by names that referred to their geographic location or characteristic foods. For example, the Agai Ticutta referred to the trout eaters near the Walker River; the Toi Ticutta referred to the tule eaters near the Stillwater Marshes. The People continue to recognize their special place on Earth and all the life cycles. Traditionally, The People lived a well-planned, harmonious life which was predicated on their immediate surroundings and nature. Time could not be wasted. Knowing what the land would offer was a matter of survival, thus The People's migration patterns were strategic and well-thought-out. The People followed the food and over the years, each band evolved as an efficient, social and economic unit that could comfortably inhabit the land. Living in cycles with the seasons, the Numu occupied the strip now known as Western Nevada, Eastern Nevada, Eastern Oregon, and Southern Idaho. The Washeshu gathered annually at Lake Tahoe and dispersed for several hundred miles throughout the remainder of the year. The Newe were found in what is today called Eastern Nevada, Utah, and Southern California. The Nuwuvi inhabited the Colorado River Basin, where they cultivated corn, squash, and beans (the three sisters), and wheat. Typical dwellings at the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony, early 1900s Each group believed that the animals of the Great Basin, on which they depended for many for food, also gave insight to creation and wise guidance on how to live. Each group spoke a different language: Washo is a Hokoan derivative; and the other dialects are of Uto-Aztecan origin. They lived in relative peace with other tribes, as all had territory for procuring resources. Much trade and commerce occurred among the original inhabitants of the entire continent. Conflicts occurred when a group raided or confiscated the resources of another group. Archeological evidence places the earliest residents of Nevada as living here about 10,000 years ago. In 1994, the Nevada State Museum carbon-dated remains which were unearthed in 1940 near Fallon. According to modern science, the burial remains of the Spirit Cave mummy prove that he lived in the area more than 9,400 years ago. Because Indian land in the Great Basin was one of the last major frontiers to be explored and settled by European-Americans, The People sustained their way-of-life and ethnic identity much longer than most Tribes in other parts of the country. When first contact occurred between Europeans and indigenous peoples in what would become Nevada, hundreds of other Tribes in areas of earlier settlement were already enduring the fourth major shift in U.S. Government policy toward American Indians. From 1492-1828, or during the Colonial Period, Indians were dealt with as sovereign nations. Many treaties and agreements were negotiated with France and England, as these countries recognized that the Indians had their own form of government, their own leaders, and their own homelands. Around 1830, the Spanish Trail opened in southern Nevada and explorers and trappers made their way into the arid landscape. In the beginning, many tribal groups were curious about these newcomers and The People attempted to establish relationships with them. Yet, as time went on, cohabitation was difficult. Spanish records have little documentation of their explorers or traders being in Washo territory, but The People's oral history suggest there were encounters. Non-Indians first recorded being in Washo lands in 1826. The Shoshone and Northern Paiute also encountered non-Indians about this time. The explorers and settlers did not understand how The People survived well in this area, using seasonal bounty and living lightly on the land. Settlers struggled to establish farms or ranches according to their known models. The 1848 discovery of gold in California led to dramatic changes, as it attracted thousands of miners and merchants. From 1778-1871 or during the Treaty Period, the U.S. government developed 370 treaties in an attempt to legally negotiate with Indian Tribes. During this era of nearly 100 years, these treaties often benefited those who were moving westward and not the tribes. The only treaty to impact Great Basin Indians was the Treaty with the Western Shoshoni [sic]. This agreement of \\"Peace and Friendship\\" was ratified in 1866. By the middle of the 1800s, so many settlers inhabited the People's land that the Indians struggled to find food. Within five years, close to 250,000 people made their way across Nevada. This encroachment extremely limited and in some areas exhausted the food supply. Even the introduction of the horse to the Great Basin served as competition for food for the Indians. Matron's Cottage, built 1967; photo prior to renovation for use as cultural center Cultural clashes soon developed, too. There was a significant difference in perspective regarding land occupation versus land ownership. The settlers believed in land ownership, meaning that once they chose an area in which to live, they tended to stay in that one location. Meanwhile, The People used the land seasonally and occupied limited areas for a short term. As The People struggled to adapt, the federal government shifted its policy towards Indians again. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 halted any future treaties with tribes and it gave Congress the authority to isolate the People in order to allow economic growth throughout the United States. This was done through the creation of reservations. The United States wanted to settle The People on reservations to extinguish their title to other lands and encourage them to adopt the western model of subsistence farming to assimilate to majority culture. The federal government believed that separating The People from the rest of its citizens would solve land disputes and reduce tensions between cultures. The development of reservations was a campaign promise of U.S. President Andrew Jackson. His administration set aside Indian Territory in lands west of the Mississippi River, far from the traditional homelands of the American Southeast and other areas from which they forced tribes. I 1859, the Department of Interior recommended that land be set aside for Indian use north of the Truckee River and including Pyramid Lake. Though an executive order was issued in 1874 to establish the Pyramid Lake Reservation, the legal year of establishment is 1859. During the Reservation Period, Nevada gained residents but it was approved for admission to the Union during the American Civil War, when President Abraham Lincoln wanted to forestall Confederate influence here. While the population did not meet regulations, the administration approved Nevada as a state in 1864. In 1871, the Indian Appropriations Act gave the U.S. Congress (rather than the states) exclusive right and power to regulate trade and affairs with the Indian tribes. The U.S. Supreme Court legally designated Indians as domestic dependent nations and wards of the federal government. In 1873 President Ulysses S. Grant established the Moapa River Paiute Reservation and the Walker River Paiute Indian Reservation by executive order. From 1887-1934, the U.S. federal government, under the Dawes Act, allotted 160-acre plots to enrolled members of western reservations. (They were registered on what are known as the Dawes Rolls, which records are often integral to tribal membership documentation.) In the early 20th century, the U.S. government commissioned a study to evaluate the conditions of Indian communities. The Meriam Report described the failures of the Dawes Act, finding that the overwhelming majority of Indian people on reservations were extremely poor, in bad health, living in primitive dwellings, and without adequate employment. It concluded that the Indians' societies could not thrive in the conditions forced onto them, and they should be encouraged to revive their traditional governments. To improve conditions and encourage revitalization of self-government, Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was called the Indian New Deal. The IRA permitted tribes to organize their own governments and incorporate their trust land. This is how the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony was established. Focus on Numa, Washo At the turn of the century, many Numa and Washo lived in the Reno-Sparks area, not only because this was the aboriginal lands for The People, but more and more Indians moved to the area to find jobs. The transition to colonies represented another adaptive strategy for the Indians. Often, The People not living on a reservation were considered \\"scattered or homeless.\\" These Indians tried to maintain some of their old ways by building traditional homes, sometimes with modern materials, in camps in urban areas, often near the Truckee River. In 1917, the federal government purchased 20 acres for $6,000 for non-reservation Indians of Nevada and for homeless Indians. This land is the core of the present-day Colony. Most of the land was not cultivatable. The BIA dug irrigation ditches to provide some drinking water, but most of the Indians collected drinking water from a spring about a quarter of a mile away. Initially, the Numa lived on the north side of the Colony, while the Washo lived on the south side of Colony. The Reno-Sparks Indian Colony and all colonies received some governmental services and were most often considered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to be under their jurisdiction. For example, the purchase of additional land in 1926 was part of an effort to improve the water supply for the Colony. Plus, from 1920-1930, a nurse and a police officer, paid from federal government funds, were stationed at the Colony. Further, in 1938 the United States Supreme Court ruled that there was no distinction between a colony and a reservation which meant that the superintendence of the Colony fell to the federal government. To that end, an additional 8.38 acres was added to the Colony in 1926. Purchased for about $4,000, this strip of land allowed for a day school. For many years, residents of the Colony sent their children to this local government operated school instead of a boarding school about 40 miles away. However, the Colony school was closed in the early 1940s because the building was in such disrepair. The Indian children's only option was to attend public school. In 1945, Grace Warner, the principal of Orvis Ring School, invited the Indian students to attend her school. This arrangement which included bussing the Colony students to Orvis Ring, lasted until 1975 when the public school system required the Indian students to attend the school closest in proximity to the Colony. (Former Orvis Ring students may view history and reconnect on the Orvis Ring Facebook Group.) As permissible under the IRA, the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony established its first formal council in 1934. On February 9, 1934 the elected council included three Paiute---Cleveland Cypher, Thomas Ochiho, and George Hooten, and three Washos ---Willie Tondy, Jack Mahoney, and George McGinnis. Harry Sampson was selected Chairman of the Council. In a letter to Nevada Senator Key Pitman, the new council supported the IRA, writing that the bill would be of lasting benefit to the progress of all Indians in the United States. Additionally, the new Colony leadership with input from Acting Bureau of Indian Affairs Superintendent John H. Holst, conducted a vote in which the IRA was overwhelmingly supported by the Colony residents. Five men: Sampson, Cypher, Mahoney, Tondy, and George Hunter, drafted a constitution for the Colony. Additional assistance crafting the constitution came from George LaVatta, a Northern Shoshone from the Fort Hall Reservation who worked as a federal government field agent. The Colony's constitution was adopted on December 16, 1935 and was approved by a vote of 51-1. In 1936, the Colony tried to adopt a charter, but the BIA's field superintendent, Alida Bowler, delayed submitting the paperwork to the federal government. Bowler did not believe all the signatures were authentic as many Colony members who could not write, had someone else sign his or her name. Bowler returned the petition with instructions to have persons who could not write, make a cross or a thumbprint, but that action had to be witnessed by two other persons. Most often charters enabled tribes to get credit which would assist the Indians with economic development. Bowler did not think the RSIC could get credit because it had no agricultural resources. However, the Colony's charter, which was approved on January 7, 1939, included plans for the tribe to establish a cooperating laundry, a store, a meat market, a gas station, arrangements for the raising of poultry, and a harness repair shop for individual Indian members who wanted to do business for themselves. Also under Sampson's leadership, the RSIC tried to take advantage of a provision in the IRA to purchase more land for the Colony. With input from E. M. Johnstone, a BIA land field agent, LaVatta, and Bowler, a proposal for the purchase of 1,080 acres between Highway 40 and the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks in the Truckee Canyon was submitted to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs on January 25, 1937. This land purchase was never accomplished. While the RSIC continued to build its sovereignty and explore economic opportunities, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower changed the federal government's policy toward American Indians and began the Termination Era. To deal with the Indians nationwide, Eisenhower sought complete elimination of the U.S. government's trust responsibility to the tribes. This meant that scores of tribes lost their federal benefits and support services, along with tribal jurisdiction over their lands. All told, the Termination Era, which lasted from 1945 to 1968, eliminated 109 tribal governments and reservations. Fortunately, no tribes in Nevada were terminated. Finally, in 1970, U.S. President Nixon developed the latest national policy toward Indians, Tribal Self-Determination. Self- Determination gave autonomy to tribes by allowing the Indians to control their own affairs and be independent of federal oversight and still allow access to entitlements and money which is more sought after than true autonomy and independence. 2016 'Today, the RSIC has expanded its original land base to just over 2,000 acres. The Colony employees over 350 employees and more than half are The People. The tribe also maintains a tribal court system, a police force and a health clinic, and it provides full government services to its membership. The tribe's other governmental departments include administration, education, public works, social services, utility district, planning, prevention coalition, enrollment, human resources, economic development, and the chairman's department. The tribal court has a judge, a clerk, an appeals clerk, a bailiff, and three other administrators who provide judicial services for criminal and civil proceedings pertaining to the tribe's jurisdiction and the enforcement of tribal ordinances. This court manages the Tribal Court Advocate Services, which provides advocates to members accused of violating tribal laws. Its appeal procedure is handled by the Inter-Tribal Appellate Court of Nevada, which consists of a three-justice panel that meets each quarter during the year. It also has a probation program to supervise juvenile offenders. The 11-person police force, which shares cross-jurisdiction with the State of Nevada, engages in community policing. Business Enterprises and Economic Development Department The Reno-Sparks Indian Colony Business Enterprises and Economic Development Department manages the business enterprises for the benefit of all Colony and community members residing in the Reno and Hungry Valley communities. The business enterprises include the Colony's smoke shops and other commercial enterprises. The Colony funds its tribal government from revenue generated by its enterprises, including tribal taxes levied on retail transactions occurring on Colony land. All five smoke shops assess sales/excise tax on tobacco product sales at a tax rate equivalent to the State of Nevada. Recently, the Colony has been diversifying from reliance on declining tobacco revenues, concentrating on other types of commercial operations to enhance return and security. However, the tribal smoke shops and other commercial properties have helped generate revenues to provide and expand governmental services to Colony members, residents and neighboring communities. Commercial Property Management In an effort to diversify the Colony's general fund from sole reliance on tobacco revenues, the Colony has leased and developed its commercial sites. Tenants include Mercedes Benz of Reno, Acura of Reno, Infinity of Reno, Wal-Mart, and many other locally owned and operated businesses. Revenues from the Colony's real estate projects provide funds for the Colony's government which provides essential services to its members, residents and other urban Indians. Economic Development Creating a diverse economic base in support of the growing self- sufficiency of the Colony's members has been the principal focus of its economic development activities since the Tribal Council initiated its diversification efforts. For over two decades, the Colony assembled development sites in Reno, Sparks and Washoe County. Located in urban, suburban and high-growth areas, this land has been acquired for development and redevelopment. In addition, the Economic Development Department carries out design and development services for community projects such as construction of the $20 million Reno Sparks Tribal Health Center on Kuenzli Street along the Truckee River. The Tribal Health Center provides health care services to its members and Washoe County's urban Indians. Other community and regional facilities currently are in the planning stage for construction in the next several years. Through its development plans, the Colony seeks to partner with private businesses and with municipal, regional and state governments. One recent example of the latter partnerships is the Colony- funded installation of a new traffic signal system and roadway improvements at the cost of $509,000 on South Virginia and McCabe streets. The Colony participated in the development of the floodwall and levee along the south bank of the Truckee River, prior to the construction of Wal-Mart on East Second Street in Reno. That undertaking involved the RSIC partnering with the Washoe County Flood Control Project, the Washoe County Public Works Department, the Nevada Department of State Lands, and Wal-Mart. At the Colony's expense, the RSIC completed a $1.3 million environmental cleanup of the site with the assistance of a Brownfields Loan, administered by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. Revenue Sharing The Colony proposed legislation that will result in the Colony sharing revenue from its Wal-Mart project. The proposal, which was passed unanimously by the Nevada Legislature, will result in the Colony funding the design and construction of a new Northern Nevada Transitional Housing Center for the Nevada Department of Corrections. The Colony will also make annual payments to the Washoe County School District in the future. The redevelopment of Reno's East Second Street neighborhood where half of the Colony's residents live, near Route 395, is another goal of economic development. The tribe's residential community is surrounded by industrial land uses. In some instances, the Colony has purchased surrounding parcels which were redeveloped to provide a buffer between the residential and industrial land uses. For instance, the Wal-Mart site was assembled by purchasing 12 industrial and commercial parcels. By redeveloping the site, and changing the land use to retail, other less desirable land uses were eliminated. Plus, walking paths along the Truckee River's floodwall and levee were constructed to provide public access to the river. The Colony's development program is assisted by various federal incentives and agencies. For example, the Indian Employment Tax Credit is available to non-tribal employers who locate their businesses on Colony lands and hire tribal members. The Indian Accelerated Depreciation Schedule is available to those non-tribal businesses who conduct business on tribal lands. Sites and Tenants Each of the Colony's development sites consist of federal land held in trust for tribal benefit. These properties are available on a ground lease basis. The Colony manages four business development sites, is landlord to 20 commercial tenants and operates five Smoke Shops. thumb See also *Field Matron's Cottage, on the National Register of Historic Places, housed a library, infirmary and meeting place, built 1926 References External links * Official Website of the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony Paiute Shoshone Washoe tribe Native American tribes in Nevada American Indian reservations in Nevada Federally recognized tribes in the United States Populated places in Washoe County, Nevada 1934 establishments in Nevada ","title":"Reno-Sparks Indian Colony"},{"id":"2826000","text":"Sir Kenneth Charles Calman, HonFAcadMEd (born 25 December 1941) is a Scottish doctor who formerly worked as a surgeon, oncologist and cancer researcher and who held the position of Chief Medical Officer of Scotland, and then England.

The theatre, named after Pulitzer-Prize winning playwright August Wilson (2005), is owned and operated by Jordan Roth of Jujamcyn Theaters. The theatre has 1,222 seats, and its longest-running show was Jersey Boys (2005-2017). Since April of 2018, the Tony Award-nominated musical, Mean Girls has been running at the August Wilson. History Theresa Helburn laying the cornerstone of the Guild Theatre in 1924 August Wilson Theatre at night Virginia Theatre, 2002 Designed by architects C. Howard Crane and Kenneth Franzheim and constructed by the Theatre Guild, it opened as the Guild Theatre in 1925 with a revival of George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra. Theresa Helburn of the Theatre Guild presided over the groundbreaking ceremony. In 1943, the building was leased to WOR-Mutual Radio as a studio. The American National Theater and Academy purchased it in 1950 and renamed it the ANTA Theatre. In 1981, the theatre was purchased by Jujamcyn Theaters and named the Virginia Theatre for owner and Jujamcyn Board member Virginia McKnight Binger. After her husband, James H. Binger's death in 2004, producer and president of Jujamcyn Rocco Landesman announced that he planned to buy Jujamcyn. He told The New York Times he had a long-standing understanding with Binger that he would buy the corporation's five playhouses. The theatres had an estimated net asset value of $30 million. On October 16, 2005, fourteen days after American playwright August Wilson's death, the theatre was renamed in his honor. That same year, Jordan Roth joined Jujamcyn Theaters. In 2009, Landesman was tapped by the Obama administration to head the National Endowment for the Arts Foundation. Landesman sold half his interest to the successful 33-year-old theater producer, Jordan Roth. Roth assumed full control of operations as Landesman departed for the NEA and still owns and operates the company today. The theatre has been closed as of March 12, 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

History  The delta method was derived from propagation of error, and the idea behind was known in the early 19th century. Its statistical application can be traced as far back as 1928 by T. L. Kelley. A formal description of the method was presented by J. L. Doob in 1935. Robert Dorfman also described a version of it in 1938. Univariate delta method While the delta method generalizes easily to a multivariate setting, careful motivation of the technique is more easily demonstrated in univariate terms. Roughly, if there is a sequence of random variables satisfying :{sqrt{n}[X_n-theta],xrightarrow{D},mathcal{N}(0,sigma^2)}, where θ and σ2 are finite valued constants and xrightarrow{D} denotes convergence in distribution, then :{sqrt{n}[g(X_n)-g(theta)],xrightarrow{D},mathcal{N}(0,sigma^2cdot[g'(theta)]^2)} for any function g satisfying the property that exists and is non-zero valued. =Proof in the univariate case= Demonstration of this result is fairly straightforward under the assumption that is continuous. To begin, we use the mean value theorem (i.e.: the first order approximation of a Taylor series using Taylor's theorem): :g(X_n)=g(theta)+g'(tilde{theta})(X_n-theta), where tilde{theta} lies between and θ. Note that since X_n,xrightarrow{P},theta and tilde{theta}-theta<X_n-theta, it must be that tilde{theta} ,xrightarrow{P},theta and since is continuous, applying the continuous mapping theorem yields :g'(tilde{theta}),xrightarrow{P},g'(theta), where xrightarrow{P} denotes convergence in probability. Rearranging the terms and multiplying by sqrt{n} gives :sqrt{n}[g(X_n)-g(theta)]=g' left (tilde{theta} right )sqrt{n}[X_n-theta]. Since :{sqrt{n}[X_n-theta] xrightarrow{D} mathcal{N}(0,sigma^2)} by assumption, it follows immediately from appeal to Slutsky's theorem that :{sqrt{n}[g(X_n)-g(theta)] xrightarrow{D} mathcal{N}(0,sigma^2[g'(theta)]^2)}. This concludes the proof. Proof with an explicit order of approximation Alternatively, one can add one more step at the end, to obtain the order of approximation: : begin{align} sqrt{n}[g(X_n)-g(theta)]&=g' left (tilde{theta} right )sqrt{n}[X_n-theta]=sqrt{n}[X_n-theta]left[ g'(tilde{theta} )+g'(theta)-g'(theta)right] &=sqrt{n}[X_n-theta]left[g'(theta)right]+sqrt{n}[X_n-theta]left[ g'(tilde{theta} )-g'(theta)right] &=sqrt{n}[X_n-theta]left[g'(theta)right]+O_p(1)cdot o_p(1) &=sqrt{n}[X_n-theta]left[g'(theta)right]+o_p(1) end{align} This suggests that the error in the approximation converges to 0 in probability. Multivariate delta method By definition, a consistent estimator B converges in probability to its true value β, and often a central limit theorem can be applied to obtain asymptotic normality: :sqrt{n}left(B-betaright),xrightarrow{D},Nleft(0, Sigma right), where n is the number of observations and Σ is a (symmetric positive semi- definite) covariance matrix. Suppose we want to estimate the variance of a scalar-valued function h of the estimator B. Keeping only the first two terms of the Taylor series, and using vector notation for the gradient, we can estimate h(B) as :h(B) approx h(beta) + abla h(beta)^T cdot (B-beta) which implies the variance of h(B) is approximately :begin{align} operatorname{Var}left(h(B)right) & approx operatorname{Var}left(h(beta) + abla h(beta)^T cdot (B-beta)right)  & = operatorname{Var}left(h(beta) + abla h(beta)^T cdot B - abla h(beta)^T cdot betaright)  & = operatorname{Var}left( abla h(beta)^T cdot Bright)  & = abla h(beta)^T cdot operatorname{Cov}(B) cdot abla h(beta)  & = abla h(beta)^T cdot (Sigma) cdot abla h(beta) end{align} One can use the mean value theorem (for real-valued functions of many variables) to see that this does not rely on taking first order approximation. The delta method therefore implies that :sqrt{n}left(h(B)-h(beta)right),xrightarrow{D},Nleft(0, abla h(beta)^T cdot Sigma cdot abla h(beta)right) or in univariate terms, :sqrt{n}left(h(B)-h(beta)right),xrightarrow{D},Nleft(0, sigma^2 cdot left(h^prime(beta)right)^2 right). Example: the binomial proportion  Suppose Xn is binomial with parameters p in (0,1] and n. Since :{sqrt{n} left[ frac{X_n}{n}-p right],xrightarrow{D},N(0,p (1-p))}, we can apply the Delta method with to see :{sqrt{n} left[ logleft( frac{X_n}{n}right)-log(p)right] ,xrightarrow{D},N(0,p (1-p) [1/p]^2)} Hence, even though for any finite n, the variance of logleft(frac{X_n}{n}right) does not actually exist (since Xn can be zero), the asymptotic variance of log left( frac{X_n}{n} right) does exist and is equal to : frac{1-p}{np}. Note that since p>0, Pr left( frac{X_n}{n} > 0 right) rightarrow 1 as n rightarrow infty , so with probability converging to one, logleft(frac{X_n}{n}right) is finite for large n. Moreover, if hat p and hat q are estimates of different group rates from independent samples of sizes n and m respectively, then the logarithm of the estimated relative risk frac{hat p}{hat q} has asymptotic variance equal to : frac{1-p}{p , n}+frac{1-q}{q , m}. This is useful to construct a hypothesis test or to make a confidence interval for the relative risk. Alternative form The delta method is often used in a form that is essentially identical to that above, but without the assumption that or B is asymptotically normal. Often the only context is that the variance is \\"small\\". The results then just give approximations to the means and covariances of the transformed quantities. For example, the formulae presented in Klein (1953, p. 258) are: :begin{align} operatorname{Var} left(h_r right) = & sum_i left( frac{partial h_r}{partial B_i} right)^2 operatorname{Var}left( B_i right) + sum_i sum_{j eq i} left( frac{ partial h_r }{ partial B_i } right) left( frac{ partial h_r }{ partial B_j } right) operatorname{Cov}left( B_i, B_j right)  operatorname{Cov}left( h_r, h_s right) = & sum_i left( frac{ partial h_r }{ partial B_i } right) left( frac{partial h_s }{ partial B_i } right) operatorname{Var}left( B_i right) + sum_i sum_{j eq i} left( frac{partial h_r}{partial B_i} right) left(frac{partial h_s}{partial B_j} right) operatorname{Cov}left( B_i, B_j right) end{align} where is the rth element of h(B) and Bi is the ith element of B.  Second-order delta method  When the delta method cannot be applied. However, if exists and is not zero, the second-order delta method can be applied. By the Taylor expansion, sqrt{n}[g(X_n)-g(theta)]=frac{1}{2}sqrt{n}[X_n-theta]^2left[g(theta)right]+o_p(1), so that the variance of gleft(X_nright) relies on up to the 4th moment of X_n. The second-order delta method is also useful in conducting a more accurate approximation of gleft(X_nright)'s distribution when sample size is small. sqrt{n}[g(X_n)-g(theta)]=sqrt{n}[X_n-theta] g'(theta)+frac{1}{2}sqrt{n}[X_n-theta]^2 g(theta) +o_p(1). For example, when X_n follows the standard normal distribution, gleft(X_nright) can be approximated as the weighted sum of a standard normal and a chi-square with degree-of-freedom of 1.

From 1904 through 1919, Magee played with the Philadelphia Phillies (1904–1914), Boston Braves (1915–1917) and Cincinnati Reds (1917–1919). He batted and threw right-handed and in a 16-season career posted a .291 batting average with 83 home runs and 1,176 runs batted in through 2,087 games played. Career A native of Clarendon, Pennsylvania, Magee was one of the premier hitters of the dead-ball era. From 1905 through 1914, Magee finished in the National League Top 10 in home runs and RBIs seven times, including leading the NL in RBIs four times. He led the league for a fourth time in the campaign, which was shortened by World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic. Magee also hit over .300 five times, including a batting title to his credit as well, while also being known as one of the finest defensive outfielders of his day. He collected 2,169 hits and 441 stolen bases, including 23 steals of home. Magee's 1911 baseball card. Magee was obtained by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1904 and remained with them for eleven years. His 85 RBIs in 1905 were an NL high. His most productive season came in 1910, when he led the league in batting (.310), RBIs (123), runs (110), total bases (263), on-base percentage (.445), slugging average (.507) and OPS (.952), and finished second in doubles (39) and triples (17). On July 10, 1911, Magee struck umpire Bill Finneran as a result of disputing a called third strike, knocking him unconscious, at which he was suspended for the remainder of the season, although on appeal the suspension was shortened to just over a month, 36 games. In 1914 Magee led the league in hits (171), doubles (39), RBIs (103), extra base hits (65), total bases (277) and slugging (.509). A year later, he was traded to the Boston Braves. He remained at Boston until the 1917 midseason, when he was sent to the Cincinnati Reds. In 1918, he led the league in RBIs (76) for the fourth time. In 1919, Magee was seriously ill for two months and he concluded his major league career by pinch-hitting twice during the 1919 World Series. Later life Magee later played in the minors and also umpired in the New York–Penn League (1927) and the National League (1928). A victim of pneumonia, Magee died in Philadelphia, at age 44. He is buried at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. In 2008, he was one of ten pre-1943 players to be considered by the Cooperstown Veterans Committee for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

It was used as a wine cooler, and specifically as part of the elite sympotic set in the ancient Greek symposium. The psykter, as distinct from other coolers, is a vase which has a mushroom-shaped body, and was produced for only a short period of time during the late-sixth to mid-fifth centuries, with almost all of this type dating to between 520 and 480 BCE. The fact of its brevity combined with there being a number of simpler methods of cooling wine suggests that this shape was merely a fad. It is possible that it came about as a response to avoiding mixing contaminated snow-ice directly in wine, as it was known that this could cause illness, but this is unlikely as the alcohol in wine has useful sterilizing properties. Even proportionately to other wine utensils of its time it is comparatively rare, with few examples being found. Although the psykter did have its specific function, nevertheless, it was almost certainly something of a whimsical device, an objet du jour, which will have given the symposion’s guests some aesthetic titillation and the host kudos for good taste. Because the process of cooling wine could be achieved in a number of other ways, none of which required the psykter, its redundancy appears to have quickly made it obsolete. Typically, wine was cooled by the addition of chilled water or snow-ice to wine in a krater, and that method pre-dated and outlasted the psykter. Less certain is precisely how it was used. It appears that it was designed to float in the krater, and to either contain wine which became chilled as it floated in the ice-cooled water, or instead the psykter was filled with ice which chilled the wine in which it floated. With regards to what effect each of these options would have on the wine’s temperature it is possible to arrive at the following conclusions. If the wine was to be chilled as is common today, to about 12 degrees C., then we would expect to see the wine in the krater and the coolant in the psykter. This is because the wine would have ice on one side (the inside) and room temperature on the other side (the outside of the krater). This would maintain the temperature of the wine part way between room temperature and 0 degrees C., though, it would be closer to room temperature than to 0 degrees C. because the outer surface area of the wine is greater than the inner surface area. However, if the wine was to be cooled to near 0 degrees C., then the only possible option is to put the ice in the krater and the wine in the psykter, as in this case the wine is almost fully enclosed by ice. Whilst neither one is conclusive, the first option is appealing because it does not alter the ancient Greek tradition of wine being mixed in the krater. Whilst the ancient sources do write of people drinking wine directly from a psykter, it is not clear whether they refer to the mushroom-shaped psykter specifically. Additionally, it would be considerably less costly to fill the psykter with ice rather than the krater. If the coolant were to be pre-chilled water then either way would be economical, although the cooling effect of chilled water, as opposed to ice, in the psykter would be minimal.

Pl. 2: 816. 1753. The flowers are purple and grouped in globular capitula, united in clusters. They appear in mid-summer, from July to September. The capitula are surrounded by an involucre made out of many bracts, each curving to form a hook, allowing the mature fruits to be carried long distances on the fur of animals. The fruits are achenes; they are long, compressed, with short pappus hairs. These are a potential hazard for humans, horses, and dogs. The minute, sharply-pointed, bristly pappus hairs easily detach from the top of the achenes and are carried by the slightest breeze – attaching to skin, mucous membranes, and eyes where they can cause severe dermal irritation, possible respiratory manifestations, and ophthalmia. The fleshy tap-root can grow up to deep. Distribution and ecology This species is native to the temperate regions of the Old World, from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean, and from the British Isles through Russia, and the Middle East to India, China, Taiwan and Japan. It is naturalized almost everywhere and is usually found in disturbed areas, especially in soil rich in nitrogen. It is commonly cultivated in Japan where it gives its name to a particular construction technique, burdock piling. The leaves of greater burdock provide food for the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera, such as the thistle ermine (Myelois circumvoluta). Cultivation It prefers a fresh, worked soil, rich in humus, and should be positioned in full sunlight. Burdock is very reactive to nitrogen fertilizer. Propagation is achieved through sowing the seeds midsummer. The harvest occurs three to four months after the seeding until late autumn, when the roots become too fibrous. Culinary use A Japanese appetizer, kinpira gobō, consisting of sauteed gobō (greater burdock root) and carrot, with a side of sautéed dried daikon \\"Gobō salad\\" Japanese burdock salad Arctium lappa L. (right), illustration from the Japanese agricultural encyclopedia Seikei Zusetsu (1804) Greater burdock root is known as niúbàng () in Chinese, which was borrowed into Japanese as gobō and Korean as ueong (), and is widely eaten in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. It was used in Europe during the Middle Ages as a vegetable, but now it is rarely used except in Italy, Brazil and Portugal, where it is known as bardana or \\"garduna\\". Plants are cultivated for their slender roots, which can grow about 1 meter long and 2 cm across. The root was traditionally used in Britain as a flavouring in the herbal drink dandelion and burdock, which is still commercially produced. Immature flower stalks may also be harvested in late spring, before flowers appear. The taste resembles that of artichoke, a burdock relative. In the second half of the 20th century, burdock achieved international recognition for its culinary use due to the increasing popularity of the macrobiotic diet, which advocates its consumption. The root contains a fair amount of dietary fiber (GDF, 6 g per 100 g), calcium, potassium, amino acids, and is low calorie. It contains polyphenols that causes darkened surface and muddy harshness by formation of tannin-iron complexes. Those polyphenols are caffeoylquinic acid derivatives. The root is very crisp and has a sweet, mild, and pungent flavor with a little muddy harshness that can be reduced by soaking julienned/shredded roots in water for five to ten minutes. The harshness shows excellent harmonization with pork in miso soup (tonjiru) and takikomi gohan (a Japanese-style pilaf). A popular Japanese dish is kinpira gobō, julienned or shredded burdock root and carrot, braised with soy sauce, sugar, mirin and/or sake, and sesame oil. Another is burdock makizushi, rolled sushi filled with pickled burdock root; the burdock root is often artificially colored orange to resemble a carrot. Burdock root can also be found as a fried snack food similar in taste and texture to potato chips and is occasionally used as an ingredient in tempura dishes. Fermentation of the root by Aspergillus oryzae is also used for making miso and rice wine in Japanese cuisine. Use in traditional medicine Dried burdock roots (Bardanae radix) are used in folk medicine as a diuretic, diaphoretic, and a blood purifying agent. Anecdotal reports from the 19th century suggest that this medicinal plant has also been used by the Ojibwa tribe, and today, in form of an ingredient in Essiac tea for the alternative treatment of some cancers. As an oily macerate, it is a component of some cosmetics, shampoos and hair care products. The seeds of greater burdock are employed in traditional Chinese medicine particularly for skin conditions and in cold/flu formulas, under the name niubangziSchool of Chinese Medicine database (; some dictionaries list the Chinese as just 牛蒡 niúbàng.) Chemical constituents Burdock roots contain mucilage, sulfurous acetylene compounds, polyacetylenes and bitter guaianolide-type constituents. Seeds contain arctigenin, arctiin, and butyrolactone lignans.

The OR&N; itself was dissolved and its assets taken over by both the UP and the Northern Pacific Railway (NP) with the line from La Grande to Elgin transferring to the UP. UP extended the line over the next two decades north and east to Wallowa by 1908 and eventually to Enterprise and Joseph. Under UP operation, the line was commonly referred to as the \\"Joseph Branch\\". UP identified the Joseph Branch for divestiture or abandonment in the late 1980s or early 1990s. In 1993, the line was sold to the railroad holding company Rio Grande Pacific Corporation (RGPC) of Fort Worth, Texas. RGPC created the Idaho Northern and Pacific Railroad to operate over the Joseph Branch & the payette to Cascade line in idaho RDC on the Eagle Cap train service, in Minam, in 2008 In 1997 the Joseph Branch was identified for abandonment later that year from Elgin to Joseph following the closure of the mill in Joseph. The county governments in Union and Wallowa counties wanted to preserve this important transportation link and put together a proposal to purchase the of abandoned railroad. After acquiring the line in 2002, the counties and their respective economic development agencies and chambers of commerce sought potential operators of either a short line (class III) railroad or a heritage railroad, which would offer tourist excursions. The latter option was successful and the Eagle Cap Excursion Train began on August 3, 2002, six years after abandonment. The 2003 season began on May 17, 2003 under initial operation by Idaho Northern and Pacific railroad until the county could buy and equip locomotives and it continued in the fall of that year. The first full season of operation began in May 2004. The excursion trains are powered by diesel gp7 locomotives, which are stored in Elgin when not in use. Through the 2008 season, three of the passenger cars used in each train were Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs), a self-propelled type of rail car. These three cars were not used in 2009 and 2010, and were sold in 2013 to the Idaho Northern and Pacific Railroad for use on its Payette River Flyer. As of 2010, the service was scheduled to operate on 11 days per summer season. The service was operating between Elgin and a location known as Kimmel, and a round trip excursion took about 3 1/2 hours. A \\"Santa Train\\" is operated in December (as of 2011), although it has been suspended in some years due to lack of sponsorship. As of May, the 2012 season of regular excursions was scheduled to begin on June 23.

Early life  Farwell was born in Painted Post, New York on July 1, 1823. He was a son of Henry Farwell (1795–1873) and Nancy (née Jackson) Farwell (1798–1887). His younger siblings included John Villiers Farwell, Simeon Farwell, and Louise Farwell (mother-in- law of Katherine Philips Edson and grandmother of Charles Farwell Edson, Jr.). He attended Elmira Academy before moving to Illinois in 1838. Career He first tried his hand at surveying and farming before moving to Chicago in 1844, when he went into banking. From 1853 to 1861, he served as the Clerk of Cook County. Farwell was \\"one of the principal builders in [Chicago's] business district\\" in the last quarter of the 19th century. That he was able to amass a sizeable fortune can be proven by the fact that he owned one of the finest mansions on Chicago's North Side. =Political career= Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives four times beginning in 1870, winning his first election to the House by a healthy margin over Chicago's \\"Long\\" John Wentworth (by some 5700 votes). Farwell went on to serve in the House of Representatives in the 42nd, 43rd, 44th and 47th Congresses. In 1876, the Democrat-controlled Congress accepted John V. Le Moyne's challenge to Farwell's election and removed Farwell from office; Farwell declined to run again at the time of the general election later on in 1876. In 1880, he was elected to another term in Congress (the 47th Congress). Upon the death of John A. Logan in 1887, Farwell was elected to serve out Logan's term in the U.S. Senate, but refused to run for re-election to a full term. Significantly, in Farwell's first term as Senator, he supported the introduction of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would have granted women's suffrage rights (the right to vote) - simultaneously a landmark achievement of and a setback in the long struggle for voting rights for women that would not be overcome until the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920. =Later life= In 1879, Farwell and his brother John were part of a group of Illinois businessmen and politicians responsible for construction of the Texas State Capitol building. The Farwell's reward for this was to become owners of over 3 million acres of land in Texas, upon which they founded the XIT Ranch. The city of Farwell, Texas is named for the Farwell brothers. Personal life In 1852, Farwell was married to Mary Eveline Smith, a New Englander who received a private education. Together, they were the parents of nine children, only four of whom lived to adulthood: * Charles Farwell (1853–1853), who died young. * Mary N. Farwell (1854–1861), who died young. * Henry Farwell (1856–1861), who died young. * Edward Farwell (1858–1864), who died young. * Anna Farwell (1860–1953), who married composer Reginald de Koven. * Walter C. Farwell (1863–1943), who married Mildred Mary Williams, a daughter of Gen. Robert Williams. * Grace Farwell (1868–1949), who married Dudley Winston, a son of U.S. Minister Frederick Hampden Winston in 1888. After his death, she married Robert Greaves McGann (1867–1953) in 1906. * Robert Farwell (1870–1872), who died young. * Rose Farwell (1870–1918), who married author Hobart Chatfield-Taylor. After a long illness, Farwell died in Lake Forest, Illinois on September 23, 1903. His daughter Rose inherited his estate, Fairlawn, at 965 E. Deerpath in Lake Forest. Upon her death in 1918, his other daughter Grace inherited the mansion, and when it burned in 1920, the McGanns hired New York architects Delano and Aldrich to rebuilt it in a Federal style with neo-Palladian brick and was finished in 1923 with original landscape was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. =Descendants= Through his daughter Anna, he was a grandfather of Ethel Leroy De Koven (1885–1943), who married broker Hans Kierstede Hudson. Through his daughter Grace, he was a grandfather of Grace Farwell McGann (1907–1949), who married James H. Douglas Jr., the Secretary of the Air Force and the Deputy Secretary of Defense (his father helped found the Quaker Oats Company). Through his youngest daughter Rose, he was a grandfather of four: Adelaide Chatfield-Taylor (1891–1982), who was awarded a Croix de Guerre for her work running a canteen in Boston during World War II, (grandmother of politician and businesswoman Meg Whitman); Wayne Chatfield-Taylor (1893–1967), who served as Under Secretary of Commerce and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt; and Otis Chatfield-Taylor (1899–1948), a writer, playwright, editor, theatrical producer; and Robert Farwell Chatfield-Taylor (1908–1980). =Philanthropy= In 1876, at his wife's urging, Farwell underwrote the construction of College Hall, North Hall and a gymnasium at Lake Forest College. The couple also donated additional land to the college which had been struggling since the end of the Civil War. Part of their philanthropy was to ensure a co-ed liberal arts college near home for their daughter, Anna, who graduated from Lake Forest College in 1880. Anna later married the composer Reginald de Koven, and became a successful socialite, novelist and amateur historian. His daughter Rose was married to Hobart Chatfield-Taylor.Bluff's Edge Estate See also *XIT Ranch  References   External links  * 1823 births 1903 deaths Burials at Rosehill Cemetery Members of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois People from Lake Forest, Illinois People from Painted Post, New York United States senators from Illinois Illinois Republicans Republican Party United States senators Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives 19th-century American politicians ","title":"Charles B.

The determinant is named after Arthur Cayley and Karl Menger.  Definition  Let A_0, A_1,ldots, A_n be n+1 points in k -dimensional Euclidean space, often with k ge n. These points are the vertices of an n-dimensional simplex: a triangle when n = 2; a tetrahedron when n = 3, and so on. Let d_{ij} be the distances between A_i and A_j, for 0 leq i < j leq n. The content, i.e. the n-dimensional volume of this simplex, denoted by v_n, can be expressed as a function of determinants of certain matrices, as follows: begin{align} v_n^2 & = frac{1}{(n!)^2 2^n} begin{vmatrix} 2d_{01}^2 & d_{01}^2 + d_{02}^2 - d_{12}^2 & cdots & d_{01}^2 + d_{0n}^2 - d_{1n}^2  d_{01}^2 + d_{02}^2 - d_{12}^2 & 2d_{02}^2 & cdots & d_{02}^2 + d_{0n}^2 - d_{2n}^2  vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots  d_{01}^2 + d_{0n}^2 - d_{1n}^2 & d_{02}^2 + d_{0n}^2 - d_{2n}^2 & cdots & 2d_{0n}^2 end{vmatrix} [10pt] & = frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(n!)^2 2^n} begin{vmatrix} 0 & d_{01}^2 & d_{02}^2 & cdots & d_{0n}^2 & 1  d_{01}^2 & 0 & d_{12}^2 & cdots & d_{1n}^2 & 1  d_{02}^2 & d_{12}^2 & 0 & cdots & d_{2n}^2 & 1  vdots & vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots  d_{0n}^2 & d_{1n}^2 & d_{2n}^2 & cdots & 0 & 1  1 & 1 & 1 & cdots & 1 & 0 end{vmatrix}. end{align} This is the Cayley–Menger determinant. For n=2 it is a symmetric polynomial in the d_{ij} 's and is thus invariant under permutation of these quantities. This fails for n>2, but it is always invariant under permutation of the vertices. A proof of the second equation can be found. From the second equation, the first can be derived by elementary row and column operations: begin{vmatrix} 0 & d_{01}^2 & d_{02}^2 & cdots & d_{0n}^2 & 1  d_{01}^2 & 0 & d_{12}^2 & cdots & d_{1n}^2 & 1  d_{02}^2 & d_{12}^2 & 0 & cdots & d_{2n}^2 & 1  vdots & vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots  d_{0n}^2 & d_{1n}^2 & d_{2n}^2 & cdots & 0 & 1  1 & 1 & 1 & cdots & 1 & 0 end{vmatrix} = begin{vmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & cdots & 0 & 1  0 & -2d_{01}^2 & d_{12}^2-d_{02}^2-d_{01}^2 & cdots & d_{1n}^2-d_{0n}^2-d_{01}^2 & 0  0 & d_{12}^2-d_{01}^2-d_{02}^2 & -2d_{02}^2 & cdots & d_{2n}^2-d_{0n}^2-d_{02}^2 & 0  vdots & vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots  0 & d_{1n}^2-d_{01}^2-d_{0n}^2 & d_{2n}^2-d_{02}^2-d_{0n}^2 & cdots & -2d_{0n}^2& 0  1 & 0 & 0 & cdots & 0 & 0 end{vmatrix} then exchange the first and last column, gaining a -1, and multiply each of its n inner rows by -1.  Generalization to hyperbolic and spherical geometry  There are spherical and hyperbolic generalizations. A proof can be found here. In a spherical space of dimension (n-1) and constant curvature 1/R, any (n+1) points satisfy begin{vmatrix} 0 & f(d_{01}) & f(d_{02}) & cdots & f(d_{0n}) & 1  f(d_{01}) & 0 & f(d_{12}) & cdots & f(d_{1n}) & 1  f(d_{02}) & f(d_{12}) & 0 & cdots & f(d_{2n}) & 1  vdots & vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots  f(d_{0n}) & f(d_{1n}) & f(d_{2n}) & cdots & 0 & 1  1 & 1 & 1 & cdots & 1 & frac{1}{2R^2} end{vmatrix} = 0 where f(d) = 2R^2 left(1-cosfrac{d}{R}right), and d_{ij} is the spherical distance between points i, j. In a hyperbolic space of dimension (n-1) and constant curvature -1/R, any (n+1) points satisfy begin{vmatrix} 0 & f(d_{01}) & f(d_{02}) & cdots & f(d_{0n}) & 1  f(d_{01}) & 0 & f(d_{12}) & cdots & f(d_{1n}) & 1  f(d_{02}) & f(d_{12}) & 0 & cdots & f(d_{2n}) & 1  vdots & vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots  f(d_{0n}) & f(d_{1n}) & f(d_{2n}) & cdots & 0 & 1  1 & 1 & 1 & cdots & 1 & -frac{1}{2R^2} end{vmatrix} = 0 where f(d) = 2R^2 left(coshfrac{d}{R} - 1right), and d_{ij} is the hyperbolic distance between points i, j.  Example  In the case of n = 2 , we have that v_2 is the area of a triangle and thus we will denote this by A . By the Cayley–Menger determinant, where the triangle has side lengths a, b and c, : begin{align} 16A^2 &= begin{vmatrix} 2a^2 & a^2+b^2-c^2  a^2+b^2-c^2 & 2b^2 end{vmatrix} [8pt] &= 4a^2b^2 - (a^2+b^2-c^2)^2 [6pt] &= (a^2+b^2+c^2)^2 - 2(a^4+b^4+c^4) [6pt] &= (a+b+c)(a+b-c)(a-b+c)(-a+b+c) end{align} The result in the third line is due to the Fibonacci identity. The final line can be rewritten to obtain Heron's formula for the area of a triangle given three sides, which was known to Archimedes prior. In the case of n=3, the quantity v_3 gives the volume of a tetrahedron, which we will denote by V. For distances between A_i and A_j given by d_{ij}, the Cayley–Menger determinant gives : begin{align} 144V^2 = {} & frac{1}{2} begin{vmatrix} 2d_{01}^2 & d_{01}^2+d_{02}^2-d_{12}^2 & d_{01}^2+d_{03}^2-d_{13}^2  d_{01}^2+d_{02}^2-d_{12}^2 & 2d_{02}^2 & d_{02}^2+d_{03}^2-d_{23}^2  d_{01}^2+d_{03}^2-d_{13}^2 & d_{02}^2+d_{03}^2-d_{23}^2 & 2d_{03}^2 end{vmatrix} [8pt] = {} & 4d_{01}^2 d_{02}^2 d_{03}^2 + (d_{01}^2+d_{02}^2-d_{12}^2)(d_{01}^2+d_{03}^2-d_{13}^2)(d_{02}^2+d_{03}^2-d_{23}^2) [6pt] & {} -d_{01}^2(d_{02}^2+d_{03}^2-d_{23}^2)^2 - d_{02}^2(d_{01}^2+d_{03}^2-d_{13}^2)^2 - d_{03}^2(d_{01}^2+d_{02}^2-d_{12}^2)^2. end{align} = Finding the circumradius of a simplex = Given a nondegenerate n-simplex, it has a circumscribed n-sphere, with radius r. Then the (n+1)-simplex made of the vertices of the n-simplex and the center of the n-sphere is degenerate. Thus, we have begin{vmatrix} 0 & r^2 & r^2 & r^2 & cdots & r^2 & 1  r^2 & 0 & d_{01}^2 & d_{02}^2 & cdots & d_{0n}^2 & 1  r^2 & d_{01}^2 & 0 & d_{12}^2 & cdots & d_{1n}^2 & 1  r^2 & d_{02}^2 & d_{12}^2 & 0 & cdots & d_{2n}^2 & 1  vdots & vdots & vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots  r^2 & d_{0n}^2 & d_{1n}^2 & d_{2n}^2 & cdots & 0 & 1  1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & cdots & 1 & 0 end{vmatrix} = 0 In particular, when n = 2 , this gives the circumradius of a triangle in terms of its edge lengths.

In May 2016, the Yurok tribe filed a federal lawsuit to stop members of the Resighini Rancheria from gillnet fishing off of the Klamath River. According to the Yurok tribe, in 1991, the Hoopa-Yurok Settlement Act divided lands into the Yurok and the Hoopa reservations. The Resighini Rancheria was offered the option of joining the Yurok tribe in order to have access to Yurok lands and access to fishing.

View to the stage. Auditorium ceiling. The Al Hirschfeld Theatre is a Broadway theatre located at 302 West 45th Street in midtown Manhattan. The Hirschfeld is one of five theatres owned and operated by Jujamcyn Theaters and current president Jordan Roth. The theatre has a seating capacity of 1,424.  History  Designed by architect G. Albert Lansburgh for vaudeville promoter Martin Beck, the theatre opened as the Martin Beck Theatre with a production of Madame Pompadour on November 11, 1924. It was the only theatre in New York that was owned outright without a mortgage. It was designed to be the most opulent theatre of its time and has dressing rooms for 200 actors. Famous appearances include Basil Rathbone as Romeo with Katharine Cornell as Juliet in December 1934; Burgess Meredith as Mio in Winterset in 1935; Richard Gere in Bent; Frank Langella in Dracula; Elizabeth Taylor in The Little Foxes; Christina Applegate as the title role in Sweet Charity; David Hyde Pierce as Lt. Coffi in the musical Curtains; and Daniel Radcliffe in the latest revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Initially owned by the Beck Family, the theatre was purchased in 1965 by William L. McKnight of Jujamcyn Theaters. On June 21, 2003, it was renamed the Al Hirschfeld Theatre in honor of the caricaturist famous for his drawings of Broadway celebrities, and reopened on November 23, 2003, with a revival of the musical Wonderful Town. In 2004, longtime president and producer of Jujamcyn, Rocco Landesman announced his plans to buy the five playhouses. In 2005, Jordan Roth joined Jujuamcyn as a resident producer, and in 2009 he acquired a 50% stake in the company. In 2009, Roth took over full operations when Landesman joined the National Endowments of the Arts. The Hirshfield is one of five theatres owned and operated by Jujamcyn Theaters. The theatre has been closed as of March 12, 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. It does not plan on opening until January 3, 2021. Architecture Lansburgh designed the Hirschfeld in a Byzantine and Moorish architectural style. A large arcaded street front spanning the length of the facade reminiscent of a movie palace and a large marquee on the roof gives the theatre a distinctive look on the quieter, west of Eighth Avenue side of 45th Street. The auditorium seats the 1,424 patrons over two levels, with an extended sloping orchestra and mezzanine, all under an elaborate, colorful Moorish painted dome. Distinctive details such as single boxes, the large proscenium arch and ornate stained glass doors in the rear of the auditorium give the room character, leading to both the interior and exterior of the theatre designated New York City landmarks in 1987. 2003 renaming In late 2002, Jujamcyn Theaters announced that the Martin Beck Theatre would be renamed in June 2003 in honor of illustrator Al Hirschfeld, as Hirschfeld approached his 100th birthday. Jujamcyn President Rocco Landesman described the renaming as \\"an important event for the history and heritage of Broadway\\".\\"Martin Beck Renamed Al Hirschfeld Theater\\" by Leonard Jacobs, backstage.com Landesman stated that \\"No one working in our world is more deserving than Al Hirschfeld.\\" Notably, Hirschfeld has become the only visual artist to have a Broadway theatre named after him.\\"Hirschfeld Theatre Dedication Ceremony Set for June 23\\" by Matt Windman, theatermania.com James H. Binger, Chairman of Jujamcyn, explained that because Hirschfeld \\"started working in New York only two years after the Martin Beck Theatre was built, it seems wholly appropriate that the building bears his name – they have shared the street during Broadway's golden age and beyond.\\" To reflect how Hirschfeld's career spanned Martin Beck's years of operation, a gallery was installed in the mezzanine that features 22 reproductions of the artist's drawings portraying plays and actors who appeared at the theatre. Although Hirschfeld died before the official renaming on June 23, 2003, he knew that he would be receiving the honor.\\"A Theater Is Renamed for Al Hirschfeld\\" by Robin Pogrebin, The New York Times, June 24, 2003 A celebration and tribute to Hirschfeld were held on the evening of the renaming, featuring performers such as Carol Channing, Matthew Broderick, Barbara Cook, playwright Arthur Miller, and many other figures drawn by Hirschfeld during their careers.\\"Broadway Salutes Al Hirschfeld at Unveiling of Caricaturist's New Theatre\\" by Simonson, Robert, Playbill Hirschfeld's traditional aisle seat was left vacant in his honor during the presentation. The tribute opened with a screen projection of Hirschfeld's Self-Portrait As An Inkwell,Buckley, Michael and Portantiere, Michael, Theatermania.com in which the artist portrays himself in his creative process and showcases his distinctive use of crow quill pen and Higgins India Ink in his drawings.\\"Hirschfeld's Strokes of Genius\\" by Frank Rizzo, Hartford Courant, January 26, 2003 The theatre constructed a new marquee to mark its renaming, featuring an illuminated version of Hirschfeld's Self-Portrait as an Inkwell.

Modern Japan is unquestionably a society that values education highly (see Education in Japan). Diverse institutions, such as the miscellaneous schools, provide social education services. Large newspaper companies and local governments sponsor cultural centers that offer ongoing programs of informal education, and department stores organize curricula covering everything from cooking classes to music, English conversation (eikaiwa), and Japanese poetry. \\"Lifelong learning,\\" another term for social education, was also a key phrase in the education reforms of the late 1980s. The responsibility for social education is shared by all levels of government, but especially by local government. Local governments also are largely responsible for such public facilities as libraries and museums--basic resources in social education. The ministry of education is interested in increasing the use of public school facilities for lifelong learning activities, increasing the number of social education facilities, training staff, and disseminating information about lifelong learning opportunities. The Japanese are voracious readers. Popular bookstores are full from the moment they open their doors each day with readers seeking books from a staggering range of foreign as well as Japanese titles. The top four national newspapers (Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, Nihon Keizai Shimbun) alone have a combined daily circulation (with two editions each day) of more than 35 million, and there are four daily English-language papers as well.

Written by Timothy Zahn, it is a sequel to Zahn's 1998 Star Wars novel Vision of the Future. Setting Survivor's Quest is set in 22 ABY, three years after the events of Vision of the Future and three years before those of Vector Prime. Characters * Luke Skywalker * Mara Jade Skywalker * Aristocra Chaf'orm'bintrano * Dean Jinzler * Evlyn * 501st Legion * Chak Fel * Jorad Pressor * General Prard'ras'kleoni * Talon Karrde Plot Survivor's Quest opens with a meeting between Talon Karrde and Luke and Mara Jade Skywalker. Karrde's people had earlier picked up an urgent transmission, addressed to Luke, coming from Admiral Voss Parck on the planet Nirauan. Before the message could be passed on, however, it had been stolen by a member of Karrde's own organisation, one Dean Jinzler. Fearing that the message might be somehow connected with the unknown menace Parck and Baron Fel had warned them about two years previous, Luke and Mara decide to head out to Nirauan. There, they learn that the message had in fact come from Chiss Aristocra Chaf'orm'bintrano (or \\"Formbi\\"). The Chiss have found the remains of the pioneering Jedi expedition, Outbound Flight Project, which had been mercilessly destroyed by Grand Admiral Thrawn many years previous. Now, the Chiss wish to hand over their find to the New Republic, and Luke and Mara join the odd group—which includes a squad of stormtroopers from the 501st, a remnant of an alien people, the Geroons, who owe a strange debt to the people of Outbound Flight, and a false New Republic Ambassador—which will visit the site of the tragedy. As they voyage on the Chaf Envoy deeper into Chiss space, into a treacherous cluster of stars known as the Redoubt, Luke and Mara grow more uneasy. Occurrences of sabotage and theft only serve to deepen their suspicions. On top of that, Mara begins to feel torn between her duty to the New Republic and her troubled respect for the Empire. The expedition reaches its destination: the remains of the Dreadnaughts that made up the Outbound Flight project. Not only are the ships fairly intact, but Mara can sense life. There are survivors, possibly hundreds of them. Suddenly, everything comes together in a whirlwind of events. The supposedly peaceloving Geroons instead are revealed to be the bloodthirsty Vagaari, who desire revenge against the Chiss and Outbound Flight for their defeat at the hand of Admiral Thrawn years before. Luke, Mara, the Chiss, the Imperials, and the embittered survivors now must work together against the Vagaari if any of them are to come out alive. They manage to defeat the Vagaari, who in turn sabotage the Chaf Envoy and commandeer one of the Dreadnaughts. The Vagaari then head back through the Redoubt to attack the Chiss command center, leaving Luke, Mara, and the others practically stranded. Following the welcome discovery of a Delta-Twelve Skysprite, however, Luke and Mara are soon pursuing the rogue Dreadnaught. They catch up to it and make their way aboard. They find out that the main Vagaari \\"colony ship\\" is actually a starfighter carrier that is beginning to overwhelm Chiss defenses. Using a fake signal, Luke and Mara trick the Vagaari into believing the Dreadnaught to be a friendly ship. However, Luke and Mara use the Dreadnaught under their control after a showdown with a droideka and the fanatical Vagaari Estosh, to aid the Chiss fighters and to defeat the other Vagaari forces. The survivors are entrusted into the care of the Empire of the Hand, and Luke and Mara finally have time to settle down and enjoy their marriage. Development Lucasfilm and Del Rey planned Survivor's Quest as a Luke/Mara parallel to Tatooine Ghost, a Han Solo/Princess Leia book being written at the time. During the outline process, Zahn got the idea to connect the novel to Outbound Flight, another Star Wars novel he was writing about a doomed space expedition. He decided to have Survivor's Quest cover what was essentially the end of the Outbound Flight Project story before the beginning was explored in the titular novel, already in the works but scheduled to be published second. Fool's Bargain Fool's Bargain is an e-book novella written by Zahn in conjunction with Survivor's Quest. Set before the events of that novel, it tells the backstory of a 501st Legion stormtrooper. The novella was first released electronically on February 3, 2004, and later published in the paperback edition of Survivor's Quest on December 28, 2004.

The Finger Lakes Railway began operation on July 23, 1995, and operates in Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, Ontario, Schuyler and Yates counties. Between 2001 and 2013, the railroad operated a heritage railroad known as the Finger Lakes Scenic Railway which offered passenger train excursions.My Finger Lakes NY Blog, Train SpottingFingerLakes.com The FGLK operates 18 diesel locomotives on of ex-Conrail trackage, formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Lehigh Valley Railroad.  Route description  =Main line= FGLK main route runs from Syracuse to Canandaigua, New York over a distance of 76 miles. Once part of the New York Central Railroad and known as the Auburn Road, it dates all the way back to the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad. At Syracuse, New York the FGLK interchanges with CSX Transportation and the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (NYSW). Travelling west, the line passes through Solvay, Camillus, Skaneateles Junction (also known as Hartlot or Skaneateles Falls), Sennett, Auburn, Aurelius (Station name Relius), Cayuga, Seneca Falls, and Waterloo. At Geneva, New York, there is a connection with Norfolk Southern Railway's Corning Secondary. Continuing west, the line passes through Phelps Junction and Clifton Springs. In Shortsville, the railroad comes to the terminus of the Ontario Central Railroad. Finally, the line arrives at Canandaigua, New York. ; Branch line to Kendaia/Romulus The FGLK operates a portion of the ex-Lehigh Valley Railroad mainline from Geneva to Kendaia running south on the east side of Seneca Lake. This was the Lehigh Valley's mainline from Waverly, New York to Buffalo, New York. This line saw much action during World War II and the Cold War with many military movements in and out of the Seneca Army Depot until it closed in the summer 1998. The now-closed base has a very large yard which at current time is used for rail car storage by the Finger Lakes Railway. The local industrial development agency works to attract new industries to locate at the abandoned depot because of the rail infrastructure. ; Branch line from Penn Yan to Watkins Glen The Penn Yan, New York branch was once part of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Only a small section of this line extends from Watkins Glen to Bellona. To get to this line, the Finger Lakes Railway uses trackage rights over Norfolk Southern's Corning Secondary from Geneva to Himrod Junction, New York, which is in the middle of the branch, from Penn Yan in the north to Watkins Glen, New York in the south. ; Ontario Central FGLK acquired the Ontario Central Railroad in October 2007.STB Decision 10/05/2007 - FD_35062_0 Previously the line had been owned by the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad. It consists of of ex-Lehigh Valley trackage that was part of the Sayre-Buffalo mainline that also makes up the Kendaia branch. The two railroads connect near Shortsville, New York.  Freight service  The Finger Lakes Railway is predominantly a freight company, and works to serve the customers and haul goods in a quick and professional process. FGLK handles about 18,000 cars of freight each year. They handle a large variety of goods serving the local agricultural and manufacturing industries. The main cargo includes plastic, canned food, clay, grain, lumber and paper products, scrap steel, chemical substances, finished steel, salt, sand, soda ash, paper, potash, fertilizer, beer, phosphorus fertilizer, telephone poles, and aluminum ingots. Finger Lakes Railway is a vital connection for the industries in the area, with its interchanges with the Class I railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern with connections to Canadian Pacific via Norfolk Southern. The goods that FGLK removes or delivers to the manufacturers are often shipped across the country, with FGLK-owned rail cars spotted in Indiana, Michigan,http://rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=929914 Kentucky,http://rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=951162 New Jersey, Maine, Ontario, British Columbia Canada,http://rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=148528 and California.http://rrpicturearchives.net/showPicture.aspx?id=99108  Heritage railroad passenger excursion trains  The FGLK once operated a passenger excursion service The Finger Lakes Scenic Railway as a heritage railroad. Operations began in October 2001 with four coaches having been purchased second-hand from Via Rail in late 1998. The cars arrived in the winter of 1999 after the seats were replaced.Finger Lakes Scenic Railway Site is Defunct. Operation of the excursions ended in mid 2013. When the excursions were being run, they included both general scenic and also seasonally themed trips.Waymarking FLSRR The following information is about the rolling stock used when the excursion trips were being offered. The information was taken from FGLK's then satellite Finger Lakes Scenic Railway website. This website is no longer online, however the URL is in the hands of advertisers. The link to it has been left in the references section should it ever return and again be accessible on the web as it was originally purposed. Two cars were upgraded by Via Rail and were set up with electric heating while the other 2 use steam heating. The two updated cars have been repainted into the old New York Central two tone Gray colors and have been named the Canandaigua, and Cayuga. The other two cars, named the Geneva and Seneca, have been repainted in the same scheme, and have been in storage awaiting upgrades to electric heating. In 2008 FGLK restored the Seneca car back into service, doing a much needed partial interior renewal. The sound system was extended into this car as well, making the passengers feel much more included. Currently, the Geneva car sits on a siding along Routes 5&20. Although it is not used for passengers, it does serve as advertising for the railroad to passing cars and pedestrians strolling along the lake. Although FGLK would like to put this car into service, it does need a lot of work, including replacing many of the windows in the car. The three grey coaches are referred to by the staff collectively as \\"The Greys\\". In 2009, ceiling fans were installed in all of the coaches in order to better circulate the air. A full baggage car joined the fleet in late 2005 with possible plans to be rebuilt into an open-air observation car. In 2007, FGLK purchased two antique passenger coaches (Ex Norfolk & Western coaches built Circa 1916). These coaches do not currently have names, but are numbered #1642 (Table Car) and #1643 (Coach). Finger Lakes Railway honored the heritage of the Lehigh Valley Railroad with these cars by painting them into a maroon color with yellow accents and gold lettering. The staff calls these cars \\"The Reds\\". The passenger cars are usually operated in two sets, with The Reds operating on the rockier track in Watkins Glen, and The Greys running across the state on the northern tracks. The Reds have 6 axles per car, causing them to ride better by spreading out the load over more track at once.

This group in the typical area in the Welsh border counties contains the following formations: Much Wenlock Limestone Formation, 90–300 ft.; Wenlock Shale, up to 1900 ft.; Woolhope or Barr Limestone and shale, 150 ft.  Stratigraphy  = Woolhope Beds = The Woolhope Beds consist mainly of shales which are generally calcareous and pass frequently into irregular nodular and lenticular limestone. In the Malvern Hills there is much shale at the base, and in places the limestone may be absent. These beds are best developed in Herefordshire; they appear also at May Hill in Gloucestershire and in Radnorshire. Common fossils are Phacops caudatus, Encrinurus tuberculatus, Orthis calligramma, Atrypa reticularis, and Orthoceras annulatum. = Wenlock Shales = The Wenlock Shales are pale or dark-grey shales which extend through Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, through Radnorshire into Carmarthenshire. They appear again southward in the Silurian patches in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Monmouthshire. They thicken from the south northward. The fossils are on the whole closely similar to those in the limestones above with the natural difference that corals are comparatively rare in the shales, while graptolites are abundant. Six graptolite zones were recognized by Gertrude Elles in this formation. = Wenlock Limestone = The Wenlock Limestone occurs either as a series of thin limestones within shales or as thick massive beds; it is sometimes hard and crystalline and sometimes soft, earthy or concretionary. It is typically developed at Wenlock Edge, where it forms a striking feature for some 20 mi. It appears very well exposed in a sharp anticline at Dudley, whence it is sometimes called the Dudley Limestone; it occurs also at Aymestrey, Ludlow, Woolhope, May Hill, Usk and Malvern. The fossils include corals in great variety (Halysites catenularis, Favosites aspera, Heliolites interstinctus), crinoids (Crotalocrinus, Marsupiocrinus, Periechocrinus), often very beautiful specimens, and trilobites (Calymene blumenbachii, the Dudley locust, Phacops caudatus and Illaenus (Bumastus) barriensis). Brachiopods are abundant (Atrypa reticularis, Spirifer plicatilis, Rhynchonella cuneata, Orthis, Leptaena, Pentamerus). Lamellibranchs include the genera Avicula, Cardiola and Grammysia whilst Murchisonia, Bellerophon and Omphalotrochus are common gastropod genera. Common cephalopod genera include Orthoceras, Phragmoceras and Trochoceras.  Silurian fauna  The greater part of the known Silurian fauna of Britain comes from Wenlock rocks; J. Davidson and G. Maw obtained no fewer than 25,000 specimens of brachiopods from seven tons of the shale. Not only are there many different genera and species but individually certain forms are very numerous. The three principal zonal graptolites are, from above downwards: Monograptus testis, Cyrtograptus linnarssoni, and Cyrtogra murchisoni.  Other areas  When traced northward into Denbighshire and Merionethshire, the Wenlock-age rocks change their character and become more slaty or arenaceous. They are represented in this area by the Moel Ferna Slates, the Pen-y-glog Grit, and Pen-y-glog Slates. All of those layers belong to the lower part of the Denbighshire Grits, a great series of slates and grits thick. Similar deposits of similar age occur on this horizon still farther north. In the Lake District, the Wenlock rocks are represented by the Brathay Flags, the lower part of the Coniston Flags series. In southern Scotland, their place is taken by the variable Riccarton Beds of Kirkcudbright shore, Dumfriesshire, Riccarton, and the Cheviots.

Attic red-figure pyxis, ca. 470–460 BC A pyxis (, plural pyxides) is a shape of vessel from the classical world, usually a cylindrical box with a separate lid. Originally mostly used by women to hold cosmetics, trinkets or jewellery, surviving pyxides are mostly Greek pottery, but especially in later periods may be in wood, metal, ivory, or other materials. The name derived from Corinthian boxes made of wood from the tree puksos (boxwood), that also came with covers. The shape of the vessel can be traced in pottery back to the Protogeometric period in Athens, however the Athenian pyxis has various shapes itself. At first, the two varieties of pyxis included the pointed and the flat-bottomed. The pointed pyxis didn't last much longer than the ninth century BCE, while the flat-bottomed continued into the late Geometric. It also continued to grow larger and more squat in proportions. The cover often depicts elaborately sculpted handles and the walls tend to be somewhat convex. During the sixth century BCE, however, Athens began producing boxes with concave walls that enabled them to be grasped easily when ranged close together on a shelf. Compare the waisted shape of the medieval and Early Modern albarello. Images on the pyxis usually depict the marriage procession from a young girl's house to that of her new husband. Pyx is a term for a specifically liturgical box, usually cylindrical, but of variable design, still used for holding and transporting consecrated hosts in the traditional Christian churches, a use to which the church began to put these boxes at a very early date.

History = Origins = Australian News Channel Pty Ltd (ANC), was founded in 1996 when Sky News Australia was launched. It was owned by British Sky Broadcasting, Seven Media Group and Publishing and Broadcasting Limited. In 2013, ANC granted 20 million in funding to Sky News Australia to be used over three years. In 2014, ANC partnered with Globecast to launch an international streaming service Australia Channel, which broadcasts five channels to subscribers outside Australia. It was launched after ANC bid to operate the Australian Government funded Australia Network contract, before the tender was controversially scrapped. Until 2015, Sky News was responsible for producing New Zealand's Prime News – First at 5:30 from Sydney, hosted by Eric Young with filming taking place in Prime's Albany studios. It lost the contract to MediaWorks and subsequently ceased broadcasting a local New Zealand bulletin. With the carriage deal between Australian News Channel and dominant subscription television platform Foxtel due to expire in 2017, reported as either February or December, media speculation increased that News Corp Australia, which co- owns Foxtel, would attempt to acquire a majority stake in the company. On 26 February 2015 it was reported that News Corp Australia launched an A$25 million bid for full ownership of Australian News Channel. In June 2015, it was reported that ANC's stakeholders had rejected a News Corp takeover offer of A$20 million, with the owners wanting a minimum of A$50 million. Following a breakdown in a News Corp buyout, further reports suggested Nine Entertainment could sell its stake to a joint arrangement between Seven West Media and News Corp. = Acquisition by News Corp = The entire company was acquired by News Corp Australia in December 2016. In December 2017, it was reported that News Corp and Telstra were in a carriage dispute over the price Foxtel pays to carry Sky News channels after the existing deal expired at the end of the calendar year, worth over A$30 million per year. News Corp was requesting an increase to the Sky News carriage fee, which has not been raised for more than a decade, while Foxtel co-owner Telstra was opposed.

It used to be the sister channel of Sky Living. It was originally known as LIVINGtv2 from the channel's launch in 2004 till 2007, and then was known as Living2 from 2007 to 2009. On 1 October 2019, Real Lives closed down and was replaced by Sky Crime. History The channel mainly showed highlights of programming from the main channel, along with extended coverage of its reality programmes, such as I'm Famous and Frightened Extra! and Most Haunted Live. However, the channel has gained the American reality TV series, The Amazing Race. The channel has also shown more lifestyle and health related programmes such as Baby ER, Birth Stories, Downsize Me and Wedding SOS. Every morning from 10 am to 12 pm, there used to be a programming slot called Baby Zone, in which programmes related to pregnancy and birth were shown. Programmes included Birth Days and Maternity Ward and Babies: Special Delivery. As of 2018, most of the programmes on the channel are repeats of factual programmes that are also on Pick. A one-hour timeshift version of the channel launched on 5 February 2009, replacing Trouble +1. Living2 was rebranded as Livingit on 30 November 2009, following problems making viewers understand that the channel is not a time-shifted version of the main channel. The relaunch was accompanied by new programming under the strapline \\"Life's worth watching\\". It was announced on 25 October 2010, that Living would be rebranded as Sky Living in early 2011 and move EPG positions on Sky from channel 112 to 107 after Sky One and before Sky Atlantic. As part of the move Livingit was rebranded as Sky Livingit. Upon the launch of the now defunct drama channel ITV Encore, on 3 June 2014, it moved to EPG slot 222 on Sky, and Sky Livingit +1, whose EPG number was replaced by Sky Arts 1 HD (SD on HD viewing) moving to slot 223.

It is responsible for Gaelic games in the United States (except for the New York metropolitan area, which is administrated by the New York GAA). The county board is also responsible for the American inter-county teams. History Hurling and Gaelic football have been played in North America ever since Irish immigrants began landing on North American shores. The earliest games of hurling in North America were played in St. John's, Newfoundland in 1788, and there are records of football being played in Hyde Park (now the site of the Civic Center) in San Francisco as early as the 1850s. There are established clubs in the cities that traditionally have a large Irish population, such as New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Boston. When the North American county board was formed it included Canadian clubs in its area of control. However these clubs are now under the control of the Canadian county board In recent years, hurling has started to enjoy support in several other U.S. cities, as evidenced by the establishment of the Milwaukee Hurling Club in 1995 and later the Twin Cities Hurling Club (MN). Other clubs include the Indianapolis Hurling Club, the St. Louis Gaelic Athletic Club, the Denver Gaels, the Greenville Gaels, the Orlando Hurling Club and the Seattle Gaels. Hurling is also starting to gather support at the club level at some universities, such as at Purdue University and Stanford University since 2005, California State University, Monterey Bay since 2006, and UC Berkeley since 2008. Interest in Gaelic Football has also developed amongst universities in America. Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia is the first school to have an officially recognized program after running independently since 2011. Boston College's program has been running since 2011, while two other Philadelphia-area institutions, Villanova University and Drexel University, hope to launch club programs soon. As of 2017 more than 51% of registered players in the United States were born there. This number is an underestimation as many clubs do not register all players that select to play only local games. =Early 21st century= The GAA in North America became the victim of two major developments in the early 21st century. One was the security clampdown that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the other was the massive growth in the Irish 'Celtic Tiger' economy. These two factors led to a reduction in the number of people travelling from Ireland to the U.S., and it became difficult for many Irish people to stay in the country illegally. Additionally, many Irish emigrants returned to Ireland, where they enjoyed a high standard of living that wasn't available to earlier generations. These factors reduced the number of people playing GAA in larger U.S. cities. The trend was partially offset by growth in smaller cities. With the onset of economic crisis of the late 2000s the flow of emigrants back to Ireland and into America has changed once again but current U.S. immigration policies have meant that the number of Irish that used to go to America is not now the same. Grassroots development is taking on a life of its own. Youth programs are springing up across the country and in particular are experiencing huge growth thanks to the success of the Continental Youth Championship.  Competitions  =USGAA Finals = Each year on Labor Day weekend, the USGAA holds a championship between the clubs in all U.S. cities where there are GAA-affiliated clubs (except for New York city). Playoffs are held between the Gaelic football, hurling and camogie champions of the different regions in the United States, to determine the USGAA champions.

CYC involves under age teams from all three of the GAA jurisdictions in North America playing football, hurling, ladies' football, and camogie at all ages from Under 8 to Under 18.

History The invention of the reverse is credited to Amos Alonzo Stagg. The invention of the naked reverse, i. e. a reverse run to the weak side, is credited to Pop Warner. Variations A classic reverse typically begins as a bootleg, sweep or end-around, but before the ball-carrier crosses the line of scrimmage he hands the ball off to a teammate, usually a wide receiver, running in the reverse (opposite) direction. Because many of the defensive players will have gravitated in the direction of the original rusher, if the second ball-carrier can outrun the defenders to the other side of the field, he has a very good chance to make a big gain. A variation of this play is a double reverse, in which the second ball-carrier takes the ball all or part way back across the field before he too hands off to a teammate running in the opposite direction. This causes the flow of the play to \\"reverse\\" a second time. A double reverse adds another level of surprise to the defense; however, the play takes more time and space to develop and increases the risk of a big loss or a fumbled handoff. Another variation is the reverse option. On a reverse option, the second ball-carrier runs for a few steps, then (optionally) passes the ball downfield to a teammate, similar to a halfback option play. Many teams will also use the threat of a reverse to gain an advantage on simple sweep plays. In such a case, the quarterback might pitch the ball to the running back, who will fake a handoff or lateral to a teammate running in the opposite direction. The distraction is sometimes enough for the running back to gain an edge in getting past the defense. Terminology Sometimes an end-around, in which the only handoff is from a stationary quarterback to a wide receiver, is imprecisely called a \\"reverse\\". An end-around is not a reverse because the lateral flow of the play does not change direction. However, it has become commonplace for fans, sportswriters, announcers, and even coaches and players to refer to any end-around as a 'reverse', and to an end-around reverse as a 'double reverse.'

In 1932 a monument was erected at the top of the mountain to commemorate the event.\\"La Reconnaissance Armenienne\\" in \\"l'Illustration\\" page XXII, 29 October 1932. The mountain was in Aleppo Vilayet, Ottoman Empire until after World War I, when the French took possession and put it in Sanjak of Alexandretta, Mandate of Syria. On 29 June 1939, following an agreement between France and Turkey, the province was given to Turkey. Afterwards Armenians from six of the villages emigrated from Hatay Province, while some of the residents of Vakıflı village chose to stay. Vakıflı is the only remaining ethnic Armenian village in Turkey, with a population only 140 Turkish-Armenians. Most who left Hatay in 1939 emigrated to Lebanon where they resettled in the town of Anjar. Today, the town of Anjar is divided into six districts, each commemorating one of the villages of Musa Dagh. As the French squads came to the rescue of the survivors, the chief priest is quoted as having said, \\"The evil only happened … to enable God to show us His goodness.\\"Franz Werfel, the faith of an exile: from Prague to Beverly Hills By Lionel Bradley Steiman, page 86 This event was depicted in the 2016 movie The Promise. The Forty Days of Musa Dagh The French warship Guichen, pictured above, participated along with several cruisers in the rescue of some 4,000 Armenians who had taken shelter on Musa Dagh. These historical events later inspired Franz Werfel to write his novel The Forty Days of Musa Dagh (1933), a fictionalized account based on his detailed research of historical sources. Werfel told reporters: \\"The struggle of 5,000 people on Musa Dagh had so fascinated me that I wished to aid the Armenian people by writing about it and bringing it to the world\\".

He studied at St John's College, Cambridge.  Career  Thomas served with distinction under his relative the Lord Protector Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547; but in 1551 he was one of the peers who condemned Somerset to death on a charge of felony. He was a trusted counsellor of Mary I of England, who appointed him deputy of Calais. Wentworth was the last Englishman to hold this post, for on 7 January 1558 he was compelled to surrender Calais to Francis, Duke of Guise, his representations as to the defenceless condition of the fortress having been disregarded by the Privy Council some years earlier. He was judged harshly for his ineptitude and indecision during the final crisis, and was even accused of treason. In fact his passive behaviour was probably due to his certainty that the cause was hopeless. His behaviour was unkindly compared to the gallant defence of Guisnes, yet Guisnes also surrendered after a few days. Wentworth himself remained in France as a prisoner of war for more than a year, and on his return to the Kingdom of England in 1559 he was sent to the Tower of London for having surrendered Calais. He was eventually acquitted of treason. He died on 13 January 1584. Wentworth appears as a minor character in the novel The Two Dianas by Alexandre Dumas.  Children  His eldest son William Wentworth married Elizabeth Cecil (born 1 July 1564), a daughter of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, but predeceased his father on 7 November 1582. The peerage consequently passed to his second son Henry Wentworth, 3rd Baron Wentworth (1558–1593), who was one of the judges of Mary, Queen of Scots, at Fotheringay in 1586. Henry was married to Anne Hopton and was father to Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland.

Origin The heel-toe foot technique was pioneered by drummers of the big band era.\\"Heel Up vs. Heel Down Drumming – Bass Drum Technique\\". Drum.Radar website - accessed Dec 7, 2019 The application most commonly used for this technique at that time was a rocking motion that assisted the drummer in keeping solid time on the hi-hat, while simultaneously playing timpani type floor tom rhythms or swinging the ride cymbal. Early video footage of Buddy Rich, along with fellow Big band drummers are seen utilizing this technique in a musical setting. Present day In modern times, this method has been implemented into various styles of music such as Drum and Bass by artists like Jojo Mayer, as well as the Heavy metal music genre by drummers such as Chris Adler (Lamb of God), James Davenport (Warpath), and John Longstreth (Origin), where the heel-toe technique is used to play a multiple stroke roll Drum rudiment on both feet. Usually this consists of double and triple strikes. Tim Waterson, used a hybrid version of heel-toe technique to set the double stroke world record for feet in the World's Fastest Drummer competition with a score of 1,407 doubles in 60 seconds. Davenport is the first drummer to build a style of playing that uses multiple stroke kick drumming as the foundation of his technique. Description The technique allows a drummer to play two strokes in a single motion similar to the Moeller method for hand technique. It consists of two parts: # Begin from a position where the heel of the foot is suspended off the floor, and the ball of the foot is barely touching the footboard (the heel can be a little higher off the floor than the ball of the foot if that works for you). Let the foot step down onto the footboard in a flam motion where first the ball of the foot strikes and depresses the footboard, and a fraction of a second later the heel lands in its usual place on the floor. Despite the flam motion, you'll only actuate the beater to play one stroke. # Using the hip flexors and calf, raise the upper leg while snapping the foot forward/down to actuate the second stroke. The ball of the foot snaps down, the heel comes up, and the ball of the foot (or toes) completes the second stroke. Your foot is back where you started, ready for another cycle. The term heel-toe is used because of the appearance of the heel pushing down on the pedal followed by the toe. In actuality, it's the ball of the foot (or toes) both times. The technique is an asset when playing double kick pedals or two bass drums as it allows for Drum rudiments to be played with the feet. When mastered, drummers can use the method to play complex patterns in the same manner as the hands in addition to rolling the bass drum. *Pros - Increased speed and endurance due to less motion required, producing more strokes with less energy. *Cons - Limited volume as a result of not using more of the larger leg muscles in the early stages. The limited volume is due to muscle fatigue if the knee and upper leg are not used to power the second stroke. Often this will cause cramp. It takes years of deliberate practice to develop the muscles needed to even out the volume.

Its members are Southern Tiwa people who had been displaced from Spanish New Mexico in 1680-1681 during the Pueblo Revolt against the Spaniards. The people and language are called Tigua (pronounced tiwa). They have maintained a tribal identity and lands in Texas.Ysleta del Sur Pueblo Official Site Spanish replaced the indigenous language in the early 1900s, and today, English is increasingly gaining ground in the community. For almost 40 years the Pueblo has owned and operated tribal businesses that provide employment for its members and the El Paso community. These businesses include the Speaking Rock Entertainment Center, Big Bear Oil Co., Inc., and the Tigua Indian Cultural Center. The tribe employs approximately 500 individuals. As part of the Indian termination policy followed by the federal government from the 1940s through the 1960s, the Tigua became the last tribe formally terminated. They were recognized as the Tigua Indians of El Paso in 1967 as a Texas Indian tribe; House Bill 888 was passed during the 60th Legislature, Regular Session, transferring all trust responsibilities for the Tigua Indians to the Texas Indian Commission. On 12 April 1968, under Public Law 90–287 82 Stat. 93 the United States Congress relinquished all responsibility for the Tiwa Indians of Ysleta, Texas to the State of Texas. The Tiwa Indians Act specified that tribal members would be ineligible for any services, claims or demands from the United States as Indians.stats Public Law 100-89, 101 STAT. 666 was enacted 18 August 1987 and restored the federal relationship with the tribe simultaneously with those of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe. The restoration act renamed the tribe to the Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo,stats 666 repealed the Tiwa Indians Act, and specifically prohibited all gaming activities prohibited by the laws of the state of Texas. http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=101&page;=668# stats 668] The Tigua have maintained a federal relationship continuously since 1987.

In the text, Milton conjectures about the formation of commonwealths. He comes up with a kind of constitutionalism but not an outright anti- monarchical argument. He gives a theory of how people come into commonwealths and come to elect kings. He explains what the role of a king should be, and conversely what a tyrant is, and why it is necessary to limit a ruler's power through laws and oaths. Full title The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates: proving that it is lawful, and hath been held so through the ages, for any, who has the Power, to call to account a Tyrant, or wicked King, and after due conviction, to depose, and put him to death; if the ordinary MAGISTRATE have neglected, or deny’d to do it. And that they, who of late so much blame Deposing, are the Men that did it themselves.Frison 2005 p. 171 Background and context In February 1649, less than two weeks after Parliament executed Charles I, Milton published The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates to justify the action and to defend the government against the Presbyterians who initially voted for the regicide and later condemned it, and whose practices he believed were a \\"growing threat to freedom.\\"Dzelzainis 2003 p. 296Woolrych 1997 p. 644 Milton aimed to expose false reasoning from the opposition, citing scripture throughout the Tenure of Kings and Magistrates to counter biblical reference that would cast holy and public disapproval on Parliament's actions.Patrick 1967 p. 365 \\"Milton’s case was not that Charles I was guilty as charged, but that Parliament had the right to prosecute him.\\"Corns 1998 p. 72 Milton later remarked that the piece was \\"written to reconcile men's minds, rather than to determine anything about Charles\\".qtd in Shawcross 1993 p. 104 The work also rebuts theories posited by Robert Filmer and Thomas Hobbes. Specifically, Milton took issue with the notions that a separation of powers leads to anarchy and that the king's power was naturally absolute.Frison 2005 p. 172 The work appeared five times: in 1649, perhaps written during the King's trial, with a second edition following in 1650 (\\"with improvements\\"), and twice in collections (Works, 1697, and Complete Collection, 1698). A final edition, revised, retitled, and presenting somewhat altered views, appeared in 1689Shawcross 1993 p. 105 during a controversy over the succession of William III. This edition, titled Pro Populo Adversus Tyrannos: Or the Sovereign Right and Power of the People over Tyrants, may have been edited by James Tyrell, a historian, but continued to be advertised, in 1691, as being Milton's work.Shawcross 1993 p. 117  Tract  Milton begins The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates by paraphrasing the words of Sallust to describe the nature of tyranny:Dzelzainis 2003 p. 306 > Hence is it that Tyrants are not oft offended, nor stand much in doubt of > bad men, as being all naturally servile; but in whom vertue and true worth > most is eminent, them they feare in earnest, as by right thir Maisters, > against them lies all thir hatred and suspicion. Consequentlie neither doe > bad men hate Tyrants, but have been alwayes readiest with the falsifi'd > names of Loyalty, and Obedience, to colour over thir base compliances.Milton > 1962 p. 190 Milton continues by discussing the nature of law, and the rule of law, and the private sphere: > And surely they that shall boast, as we doe, to be a free Nation, and not > have in themselves the power to remove, or to abolish any governour supreme, > or subordinat, with the government it self upon urgent causes, may please > thir fancy with a ridiculous and painted freedom, fit to coz'n babies; but > are indeed under tyranny and servitude; as wanting that power, which is the > root and source of all liberty, to dispose and œconomize in the Land which > God hath giv'n them, as Maisters of Family in thir own house and free > inheritance. Without which natural and essential power of a free Nation, > though bearing high thir heads, they can in due esteem be thought no better > than slaves and vassals born, in the tenure and occupation of another > inheriting Lord. Whose government, though not illegal, or intolerable, hangs > over them as a Lordly scourge, not as a free government; and therfore to be > abrogated. How much more justly then may they fling off tyranny, or tyrants; > who being once depos'd can be no more the privat men, as subject to the > reach of Justice and arraignment as any other transgressors.Milton 1962 pp. > 236–237 Milton calls on the people to support Parliament's actions and wisdom: > Another sort there is, who comming in the cours of these affaires, to have > thir share in great actions, above the form of Law or Custom, at least to > give thir voice and approbation, begin to swerve, and almost shiver at the > Majesty and grandeur of som noble deed, as if they were newly enter'd into a > great sin; disputing presidents, forms, and circumstances, when the Common- > wealth nigh perishes for want of deeds in substance, don with just and > faithfull expedition.

The work is unique compared to other works during its time because Milton emphasises the deeds of individuals as the only way for there to be justice. The work also emphasises the freedom of the individual, and only through such freedom is an individual able to develop properly. Citing classical and biblical references, this emphasis refutes Hobbes’s divine right of kings. Milton argues that no man is better than another, having all been created in God's image, free and equal, and that all have a right to dispose of themselves. Further, he argues that their freedom and equality entitles them to inflict the same treatment upon the king they would receive at the hands of the law, that magistrates are empowered by the people:Frison 2005 p. 176Frison 2005 p. 178 > It being thus manifest that the power of Kings and Magistrates is nothing > else, but what is only derivative, transferr’d and committed to them in > trust from the People, to the Common good of them all, in whom the power yet > remains fundamentally, and cannot be tak’n from them, without a violation of > thir natural birthright.qtd in Frison 2005 p. 177 Milton emphasises the concept of trust, instilled in the king by the people, and the dynasty’s violation of that trust.Frison 2005 p. 177 He describes the crimes perpetrated by the executed King, asserting that kings are accountable to more than just God.Frison 2005 p. 179 Also, Milton emphasises the importance of an education focusing on the ability to discriminate between ideas and establishing self-discipline.Shawcross 1993 p. 104 Reception The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates immediately influenced the political works and theories of many others, including Bulstrode Whitelocke, John Canne, John Lilburne, John Twyn, and various anonymous works. The amount of attention that the work received prompted John Shawcross to declare that the work, itself, allowed Milton to be viewed as a \\"great writer\\". Later on, the work was able to influence others without them knowing; a piece by Algernon Sidney, which copies words directly from The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates, influenced various tracts and many responders to Sidney did not know that the lines were originally from Milton.Shawcross 1993 p. 106 Milton's controversial denial of the divine right of kings prevented widespread acceptance of The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates.

Model concept The RB family of bus and coach chassis was evolved from designs made by Hyundai's Thames commercial vehicle subsidiary until 1978. The engine was mounted at the rear of the vehicle, and a passenger entrance was provided ahead of the front axle, opposite to the driver. The original RB520 and RB585 models later became the RB520 and RB585 automatics, and with constant revision and upgrading, they gave way to the RB600 by 1986. In an attempt to lower the floor height of the vehicle, the supercharged diesel engine was tilted over to one side around 1978. In South Korea, the RB was popular during the 1980s, when considerable financial assistance was available to operators for fleet renewal. However, following the election of the Grand National Party Government in 1986, the Stock Exchange money began to dry up causing demand for buses to decline. This led Hyundai to build the next-generation Aero City bus around 1991.

Not all cervical vertebrae are featured due to the dissection cut. The Cryptodira (') are a suborder of Testudines that includes most living tortoises and turtles. Cryptodira differ from Pleurodira (side-necked turtles) in that they lower their necks and pull the heads straight back into the shells, instead of folding their necks sideways along the body under the shells' marginals. They include among their species freshwater turtles, snapping turtles, tortoises, softshell turtles, and sea turtles.  Neck retraction  The Cryptodira are characterized by retraction of the head in the vertical plane, which permits for primarily vertical movements and restricted lateral movements outside of the shell. These motions are largely due to the morphology and arrangement of cervical vertebrae. Of all recent turtles, the cervical column consists of nine joints and eight vertebrae. Compared to the narrow vertebrae and the closely positioned zygapophyses of the pleurodires, the cryptodires’ vertebrae take on the opposite shape. Their cervical vertebrae are more distended, and their zygapophyses (processes that interlock adjacent vertebrae) are much more widely spaced - features allowing for a condition called ginglymoidy, and ultimately, their “hidden” neck retraction. Ginglymoidy refers to the double articulation where articulation between the sixth and seventh vertebrae and the seventh and eighth vertebrae allows for bending of the neck into an S shape. Formation of this S shape occurs in one plane that enables retraction into the shell. Cryptodiran neck retraction is also dependent on associated cervical musculature for its characteristic motions. In a study that focused solely on the mechanism of neck retraction in Chelodina (Pleurodire) versus that of Apalone (Cryptodire), an absence of the longissimus system, the Iliocostalis system and minimization of the epaxial musculature was found. Absence of longissimus musculature, which primarily functions in moving the neck via ipsilateral flexion and contralateral rotation, contributes to the backwards retraction of the neck into the shell. Lack of this muscular system also results in poorly developed transverse processes (the lateral processes of a vertebra), forcing them to be developed in a more cranial direction. The iliocostalis system, used for lateral flexion and extension of the vertebral column, is commonly absent in all turtles. With the presence of a shell, these muscular movements are no longer possible. Epaxial musculature that functions in alternated forms of stepping and walking is minimized in turtles, due to their restricted stride lengths and heavily weighted shells.  Systematics and evolution  Cryptodires evolved during the Jurassic period, and by the end of the Jurassic had almost completely replaced pleurodires in the lakes and rivers, while beginning to develop land-based species. Meanwhile, pleurodires became the dominant freshwater testudines in the Cretaceous to Eocene of Europe, and produced a family of marine species, the Bothremydidae. The Cryptodira suborder has three living superfamilies, the Chelonioidea (sea turtles), Testudinoidea (tortoises and pond turtles), and Trionychoidea (soft- shell turtles and relatives). The families within the Kinosternoidea are now recognized as a paraphyletic assemblage of mostly primitive Trionychoidea; they do not form a natural group. Two circumscriptions of the Cryptodira are commonly found. One is used here; it includes a number of primitive extinct lineages known only from fossils, as well as the Eucryptodira. These are, in turn, made up from some very basal groups, and the Centrocryptodira contain the prehistoric relatives of the living cryptodires, as well as the latter, which are collectively called Polycryptodira. The alternate concept restricts the use of the term \\"Cryptodira\\" to the crown clade (i.e. Polycryptodira). The Cryptodira as understood here are called Cryptodiramorpha in this view. A recent study placed Plesiochelyidae as an Angolachelonia and outside Testudines, thus Cryptodira. As per the system used here, the Cryptodira can be classified as: Manchurochelys liaoxiensis was a member of Sinemydidae.

Formed in 2000, the parliament has 369 members, who are elected to represent the views of young people in their area to government and service providers. Over 500,000 young people vote in the elections each year, which are held in over 90 percent of constituencies. It is managed by the British Youth Council. Members meet regularly to hold debates and plan campaigns at least three times a year locally, and twice on a national level, which includes the annual debate within the Chamber of the House of Commons every November. Young people hold positions throughout the organisation's management, and it has been endorsed by the majority of the UK's political parties. Those elected for UKYP hold the suffix of MYP (Member of the UK Youth Parliament). During House of Commons sitting, UK Youth Parliament will be co-chaired by Speaker Lindsay Hoyle and Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing.  Formation  The concept of a United Kingdom Youth Parliament first arose at an event in Coventry entitled \\"Heirs To The Millennium\\". After the event, the MP Andrew Rowe and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and youth worker Kate Parish began to develop a proposal for the youth advocacy group. In 1998, a steering committee was formed, led by Andrew Rowe and chaired by a young person named Jannik Ecke. In 2000, Malcolm Wicks, Department for Education and Employment, agreed to employ a member of staff who would work full-time on developing the UK Youth Parliament alongside Kate Parish. Soon after, the first elections for the UK Youth Parliament were held, with the first Annual Sitting being held in 2001. There is wide debate over who was key to the formation of the UK Youth Parliament with several people trying to claim that they were key to its formation.  Composition  = Membership = A Member of Youth Parliament (MYP) works with MPs, service providers, and decision makers in order to present the views of their constituents to them. Deputy or Support Members of Youth Parliament (DMYP/SMYP) are also elected, although not every MYP has a deputy. Deputies work with and support their Member of Youth Parliament locally and regionally, but are not entitled to attend the Annual Sitting or other national events – unless their MYP is unable to. There are 369 constituencies that MYPs can sit in. = Elections = The UK Youth Parliament elections are held every one or two years (depending on the local authority), with all young people between the ages of 11–18 being entitled to vote or stand. In England, over 90 percent of the local education authorities hold UKYP elections. Young people elect their local area's MYPs, who provide a voice for the young people in their area. The number of MYP positions is proportionate to the population of young people in the authority. Over one million votes were cast in the elections between 2006 and 2009. In 2008, 565,802 young people voted, with 1,625 standing as candidates from across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Outside of England, partner organisations undertake the elections; in Scotland, elections are held every two years for young people to elect their local Member of the Scottish Youth Parliament (MSYP). The Scottish Youth Parliament then internally appoints sixteen of their members to represent the nation as their Members of the UK Youth Parliament which means that Scottish MYPs hold a dual mandate as both a MYP and a MSYP. In Northern Ireland a similar system is used by the Northern Ireland Youth Forum and was used in Wales until 2014 by the Children and Young People's Assembly for Wales. In 2018 the first online elections were held in Wales which returned 60 members for the Welsh Youth Parliament.  Meetings  = Annual Sitting = Members of Youth Parliament in session at the 2009 Annual Sitting The Annual Sitting is the parliament's main yearly meeting, which all MYPs attend. It takes place on a university campus over three days. Proceedings include keynote speeches from political figures, followed by question and answer sessions. Past speakers include Hazel Blears, Ben Bradshaw, and Des Browne. MYPs also hold debates on topical issues, undertake training in campaigning, democracy and leadership, and consult with outside organisations such as the Ministry of Justice, BBC Trust and Department for Transport. At each Annual Sitting, a manifesto is created, in which MYPs aim to fully represent the issues that affect their constituents in a single document. Policies are developed based on seven key areas: Culture, Media & Sport, Education & Employment, Empowering Young People, Health, International Matters, Law & Society, and Transport, Environment and Rural Affairs. This manifesto is then presented to government as a current overview of young peoples’ views. The 9th Annual Sitting was held at the University of Kent from 24 July to 27 July 2009. The keynote speakers were: * John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons * Wes Streeting, President of the National Union of Students * Jonathan Shaw, Minister for the South East * Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury UKYP's 10th Annual Sitting for 2010 was held at Ulster University between Friday 23 July and Monday 26 July. UKYP held its 11th Annual Sitting in 2011 at the University of Leeds from Friday 22 July to Sunday 24 July. UKYP were joined by the following speakers: * John Bercow * Iby Knell, a Holocaust survivor * Natascha Engel, Chair of the Backbench Business Committee * Tim Loughton, Parliamentary Under Secretary for Children & Families * Maggie Atkinson, Children's Commissioner * Chris Williamson, Labour politician * Liam Burns, NUS President * Susan Nash, Chair of Young Labour * Ben Howlett, Chairman of Conservative Future The 12th UKYP Annual Sitting for 2012 took place at the University of Nottingham over the weekend of 27–29 July. The 13th UKYP Annual Sitting for 2013 again took place at the University of Leeds. Speakers included Vince Cable; John Bercow; and Pamela Warhurst of Incredible Edible. The 14th UKYP Annual Sitting for 2014 took place at the University of Lancaster over the weekend of 25–27 July. Keynote Speakers included John Bercow; Maggie Atkinson; and Kamal Hyman, a previous Member of Youth Parliament for Peterborough. The 15th UKYP Annual Sitting for 2015 took place at the University of Exeter over the weekend of 31 July - 2 August. Keynote Speakers included John Bercow; Jonny Chatteron, founder of the campaign group Campaign BootCamp; and Siân James former Labour Party Member of Parliament for Swansea East. UKYP'S 16th Annual Sitting for 2016 took place at the University of York, between 22–24 July. Keynote speakers included John Bercow and Gulwali Passarlay. In 2017, UKYP's 17th Annual Sitting took place at Liverpool Hope University between 28–30 July 2017, with keynote speakers John Bercow and Hillsborough campaigner Margaret Aspinall, as well as various MPs and campaigners involved in a panel debate. The 18th UKYP Annual Conference - name changed after a vote was held and majority returned in favour of change - took place at the University of Nottingham from 27-29 July 2018. The keynote speakers included John Bercow, Joy Warmington of brap and Alison Kriel of Amaya Trust. The 19th UKYP Annual Conference took place at the University of Leeds from 2-4 August 2019, where the keynote speakers included John Bercow. = Circles of Influence = The annual Circles of Influence aimed to focus on key youth issues, by engaging government departments, public organisations and young people in an exciting debate format. It involved around 200 MYPs holding discussions seated in a circular shape. The event was first held in 2006, and took place at the British Museum. It has focused on topics including talent, leadership, and intergenerational relations. Prominent attendees included Tessa Jowell, Lord Taylor and Harriet Harman. = House of Lords debates = In May 2008, the UKYP was granted permission to hold a debate between over 300 MYPs in the House of Lords, making it one of only two organisations to ever use the venue for non-Parliamentary proceedings, the other being the English Speaking Union for their International Mace Final on 12 May 2007. The event was chaired by the Lord Speaker Baroness Hayman and was broadcast on BBC Parliament. The debates held were: * Recycling and the environment * National transport concession for young people * Abolish university tuition fees * Fair representation of young people in the media * Lowering the voting age to 16 * Whether the amount of betting stores should be restricted. * Single age of adulthood = House of Commons debates =  2007–09  Prime Minister Gordon Brown suggested that members of the UK Youth Parliament could have annual access to the House of Commons chamber in 2007, but this did not come about until March 2009, when a motion was passed to allow the UK Youth Parliament to use the House of Commons for that year's annual meeting. However, a Conservative Member of Parliament objected, which forced a vote to be taken on the issue, also employing a procedure called \\"I spy strangers\\" (historically used to expel disruptive spectators, but now mostly to disrupt the House's business) to take business in the House beyond 7:00pm and stifle any possible debate on the issue. On 12 March, a second debate was held in the House of Commons with a vote set to be taken four days later. On 16 March 2009, 189 Members of Parliament voted to allow the UK Youth Parliament to debate in the House of Commons, with 16 votes of opposition by Conservative backbenchers. It was the first time in history that the House of Commons chamber was used by a group other than MPs. An online vote was held from July to determine the debate topics, which were: * Abolish university tuition fees * Youth crime and how to tackle it * Free transport for over 60s, but not for young people * Capitalism, the economy and job opportunities for young people * Lowering the voting age to 16 The debates took place in the House of Commons chamber on Friday 30 October 2009, from 11am to 3:30pm. The session was recorded in Hansard, and the morning debates were broadcast on BBC Parliament the same day. The final two debates were televised later in the week. The debates were chaired by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, who closed the event with a dramatic speech to MYPs in which he described the British National Party as \\"a poison which we could well do without\\". The Speaker is usually expected to remain impartial, so as not to compromise his authority, but in this case was able to express personal opinion because the ornamental mace that indicates Parliament is sitting was not in place.  2010  In 2010 a debate was held to disuses the possibility of the youth parliament returning for a second sitting. This resulted in the decision to allow their return not only for that year, but every year for the remainder of the sitting of the current parliament. UKYP's 2010 Debate took place on 29 October, again chaired by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons with the topics chosen for debate being selected from an Online Ballot. It was broadcast live on Parliament's Website & BBC Parliament. As reported on the UK Youth Parliament's official website, the results of the five issues that were debated are listed as follows: *Should sex and relationships education be compulsory from primary school onwards? FOR-211 and AGAINST-104 *Should university tuition fees rise? FOR-57 and AGAINST-267 *Should the school leaving age be raised to 18 immediately in order to lower youth unemployment? FOR-56 and AGAINST-271 *Should we withdraw all British troops from Afghanistan by 2012? FOR-137 and AGAINST-179 *Should reduced transport fares for young people be protected from spending cuts? FOR-239 and AGAINST-80 Therefore, \\"Should reduced transport fares for young people be protected from spending cuts?\\" became UKYP's National Campaign for 2011.  2011  In 2011, the Members of Youth Parliament again debated in the House of Commons on 4 November. This time five topics were chosen by over 65,000 young people. The event was chaired by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, after his persistence in supporting the youth parliament. The sitting was broadcast on BBC Parliament but this time live from 11:00am – 4:00pm. Following the debates, the motion entitled 'Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all' was chosen as UKYP's National Campaign for 2012.  2012  In 2012 and for the fourth time, Members of UKYP gathered in the House of Commons on 23 November, with the topics again being chosen through the Make Your Ballot. There was a large increase in turnout. From 65,000 in 2011, over 253,000 took part to choose the five topics that were debated. Again it was chaired by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, and was broadcast live via Parliament's Website & BBC Parliament from 11:00-16:00. ‘A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life’ received 154 votes from the 295 cast and therefore became UKYP's 2013 National Campaign.  2013  In 2013, Members of UKYP came together for the fifth year in a row to debate on the green benches on 15 November, the top five issues chosen through the Make Your Mark Ballot. A record 478,386 young people took part, an increase of over 225,000 from 2012. In a difference to choosing campaigns, Members of UKYP chose two campaigns for 2014; one UK-wide issue and one devolved issue (England only). It was chaired like the other debates by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, and broadcast live on Parliament's Website & BBC Parliament from 11:00-16:00. Following the debates in which Nick Hurd MP, then Minister for Civil Society stated that 'Old shouldn't dominate politics', ‘Votes For 16 and 17 Year Olds In All Public Elections’ was prioritised as the UK Priority Campaign for 2014, whilst ‘A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life’ was voted as the priority campaign for England.  2014  The 2014 UKYP sitting in the House of Commons took place on 14 November with the biggest media attention in the sitting's six-year history. Once more chaired by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, the topics were chosen through 876,488 ballots, around 14.8% of the UK's 11-18-year-old population. The proceedings were broadcast on Parliament's website as tradition but were only shown through the BBC via their Democracy Live Site; the reason for this was due to the Scottish National Party's Annual Autumn Conference commencing that day. However, it was broadcast between 20:20-00:00 on BBC Parliament that day to give chance for viewers to watch if they couldn't watch online. Also, for the first time the event was covered by Sky News on the world's biggest video sharing site, YouTube through their 'Stand Up Be Counted' campaign, which was launched in the summer of 2014. Before the debates on campaigns occurred, MYPs held a special commemoration marking the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I. Thirteen MYPs were selected by a video application process to speak from the Dispatch Boxes on how the war affected either their families of region followed by one minute of silence. This was agreed on at UKYP's Annual Sitting in Lancaster that summer. Once the debates and speeches from Leader of the House of Commons, William Hague, Natascha Engel MP and Tessa Munt MP had taken place, the following information shows the results of the two votes; one for the UK-wide 2015 issue and like 2013's debate, one devolved issue for England: UK-wide issue: *Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage: 156 *Votes for 16- and 17-year-olds in all public elections: 117 England-wide issue: *Mental health services should be improved with our help: 176 *Better work experience and careers advice: 78 *Bring back exam resits in English and Maths: 32 Therefore, 'Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage' was chosen as UKYP's UK Campaign for 2015 whiles 'Mental Health services should be improved by our help' became UKYP's 2015 Campaign for England.  2015  The 2015 sitting took place on 13 November, following the counting of 969,992 Make Your Mark Ballots that were cast through the ballot. After the debates occurred, a special 30 minute debate entitled \\"My Magna Carta\\" was held, 800 years after the historic document was first signed. The information below states the results of the ballots, to choose what of the debated topics would become the two priority campaigns for 2016: UK Wide: • Working together to combat racism and religious discrimination: 155 • Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage: 117 Tackling Racism and Religious Discrimination therefore became the UK Wide campaign for 2016, and became the inquiry subject for the year's Youth Select Committee. Devolved: • Mental health services should be improved with our help: 176 • A curriculum to prepare us for life: 110 • Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all: 33 The existing Mental Health campaign was therefore re-selected as the devolved campaign for 2016.  2019 Sitting - amongst the General Election campaign  Despite the calling of the 2019 United Kingdom general election, the sitting still went ahead and took place on 8 November 2019. The debates were chaired for the first time by both the new Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and fellow speakership candidate and current 1st Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing. As has been for each sitting, the Make Your Mark ballot determined the topics and overall saw just over 840,000 young people take part across the United Kingdom in 2019, with the motion on Protecting the Environment becoming the parliament's UK wise campaign for 2020 and Ending Knife Crime being chosen by MYP's as the devolved campaign topic. The full results were as follows: UK Wide Campaign Topic Protecting the Climate - 179 Tackling Hate Crime - 68 Devolved Campaign Topic Mental Health - 69 Curriculum to Prepare us for Life - 86 Put an End to Knife Crime - 87 For the first time, the UK wide campaign topic will be launched as a Parliamentary E-Petition of which will be debated in the Commons chamber, if 100,000 members of the public sign it. The petition will be launched in early 2020. Due to dissolution of Parliament and it having taken place on 6 November 2019 (being prior to 8 November's proceedings), full broadcasting of the debates along with the publication of media reports, under election regulations were not published until 16 December 2019 - the week following the election. Full proceedings were made available on Parliament's YouTube channel that morning.  Paul Boskett Memorial Trophy  In 2014 the introduction of the Paul Boskett Debate Lead Trophy was introduced. Every region elects someone to represent them and speak at the Dispatch Box and the strongest speaker is now awarded; the name comes from the late Paul Boskett MBE, who died in 2014 aged 59; he worked and was a lead figure within the British Youth Council. Paul is cited as a major inspiration for many young people and seen as a key champion of youth voice. The first Debate Lead Champion was Ife Grillo who sat as a Vice Chair to the British Youth Council between 2015-2017 and at the time of the Commons debate on 14 November 2014, represented the London Borough of Hackney.  Regional  Members of Youth Parliament in England are split into nine geographical regions, which meet and work together regularly: London, East Midlands, West Midlands, South West, South East, North West, North East, Yorkshire and the Humber, East of England. Regional meetings known as conventions take place three times a year (June, October and December) and last around a day. Members share news, issues and resources, in addition to taking part in training to help them in their role, relevant Government Consultations and within the October Convention, Elections occur to decide regional representatives to be a Debate Lead for UKYP's House of Commons Debate and the UKYP Steering Group for the following year (1 February to 31 January).  Campaigns  The UK Youth Parliament launched the \\"Make Your Mark\\" ballot in 2011. The purpose of the ballot to get young people from across the UK to determine which five topics the UK Youth Parliament would debate within the House of Commons. Over 65,000 young people completed the ballot after several months of campaigning. The first five issues debated in the House of Commons chamber through 'Make Your Mark' were: # \\"Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all\\" # \\"No to tuition fees, yes to graduate tax\\" # \\"Zero tolerance towards bullying in schools\\" # \\"End child poverty\\" # \\"A Greener future for Britain\\" On 4 November 2011, Members of Youth Parliament came from across the UK to debate and vote at House of Commons the most important issue to campaign on in 2012. The winning campaign topic was \\"Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all\\". 2012's sitting chose ‘A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life’ as the 2013 National Campaign. Over 253,000 young people took part. In 2013, ‘Votes For 16 and 17 Year Old's In All Public Elections’ was prioritised as the UK Priority Campaign for 2014, whilst ‘A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life’ was voted as the priority campaign for England. A new record of 478,386 young people cast a vote. In 2014 876,488 young people helped to choose the House of Commons topics; over 14.8% of the UK's 11-18 year old population. 'Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage' was chosen as UKYP's UK Campaign for 2015 with a National Campaign Day occurring on 24 January 2015. Also 'Mental Health services should be improved by our help' became UKYP's 2015 Campaign for England. 2015 recorded 969,992 votes and saw that year's Commons Debate select Mental Health chosen as the England Campaign issue and Tackling Racism & Discrimination as the UK priority topic to campaign on. 2016 saw another increase in MYM's total, with 978,216 having there say and as a result of that year's debates on the famous Green Benches, saw Votes at 16 be selected as the England campaign issue and a Curriculum for Life for the 2nd time be the national priority campaign topic. In 2017, the Make Your Mark for the first time in the ballot's history fell, to 954,766 - of which however was widely still seen as an impressive total considering the scale of Youth Provision cuts since 2010. Both issues chosen in 2016, of a Curriculum for Life and Votes at 16 were once again selected by MYP's to be the priority campaign topics, however with them being switched in relation to the campaign area, meaning Votes at 16 took national precedent and a Curriculum for Life reverted to England only focus. 2018's Ballot has written history and seen a initial total of 1,022,286 votes be declared, marking the first time Make Your Mark has exceeded 7 figures; with an increased and revised 2nd total to be announced on 24 October 2018, along with the Commons Debate topics for this year's proceedings - to be held on 9 November 2018.  Organisation  = Governance =  Steering Group  Decisions regarding the development and progression of the organisation is undertaken by the Steering Group, made up of one MYP elected from each region and nation (known as \\"SGs\\"), for a 12-month term from 1 February to 31 January the following year. Their main focus is \\"key decisions relating to the membership and the programme of work, within the given strategic boundaries\\". They meet a minimum of four times a year to represent their regions nationally, coordinate campaign efforts and organise events such as the Annual Conference. Reports are taken back to MYPs at their regional conventions & other meetings. The name of the group was changed from Procedures Group to Steering Group in November 2019 in order to reflect the groups varied responsibilities better.  Management and support  The British Youth Council manages the UK Youth Parliament. The British Youth Council won a bid in 2011, granted by the Department for Education to lead a national Youth Voice Service. Youth Voice will support young people in influencing local and national Government decision making in England, and provide continued support for the UK Youth Parliament. The corporate and administrative governance is overseen by the Board of Trustees of the British Youth Council.  Reception  = Praise = The organisation has been endorsed by former Prime Ministers Gordon Brown and David Cameron. It has also been endorsed by former Liberal Democrat Party Leader and former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. In 2009, Brown described the UK Youth Parliament as \\"a symbol of the politics we should all strive for - politics that bring people together to work for what is best for us all.\\" In 2006, the organisation's Head of Programmes Kate Parish was given a National Council for Voluntary Youth Services Award, for her \\"commendable dedication to the development of UK Youth Parliament\\". In 2008, the UK Youth Parliament was given the Positive Images award by the Children & Young People Now magazine for exposing young people’s experiences of the current levels of sex and relationships education in a high-profile publicity campaign. In 2009, the organisation also received a Brook special achievement award for this campaign. = Criticism = MYPs co-signed an open letter with public figures including Davina McCall and Polly Toynbee to The Times. The letter protested against the lack of sufficient sex and relationships education in schools, and that the UK Youth Parliament believe that this has led to increasing teenage pregnancy. A study by the University of Colorado found that youth participation organisations in the UK, including the UK Youth Parliament, needed to \\"tackle the unintentional practice of tokenism\\". The paper concludes that \\"failing to act upon [young people's] opinions or take them very seriously\\" once they are identified is often a cause of frustration amongst participants.

Early life Ruud is an only child. Growing up, he first initiated himself to music by playing the keyboards, but his passion for music developed in favor of the guitar soon after he watched a video of an Iron Maiden concert. Thus, after he was done with high school, Ruud attended the conservatory for his college education majoring in jazz guitar. He graduated in 1999. Work prior to Within Temptation Ruud started out by playing with several local bands. He joined Brotherhood Foundation, a nu-metal band whom he stayed with for a period of two years. When Brotherhood Foundation was playing at the 1998 \\"Dynamo\\" festival in the Czech Republic, Ruud met Within Temptation who were also playing there. Back then, Michiel Papenhove was still Within Temptation's guitarist, and there were no initial plans for Ruud to join the symphonic metal band yet. In an interview with Starfacts, Ruud stated that his most embarrassing gig experience was when he still had long hair and it was caught in the microphone while headbanging. He thought it was doubly embarrassing because the girl he loved was in front row. They never got together. After Brotherhood Foundation, Ruud joined an alternative rock band \\"Vals Licht\\" (False Light) in 2001. This band was known for its combination of heavy music with Dutch lyrics, something that had never been done before. They released several singles on the Dutch market, of which \\"Het Licht\\" reached the top ten charts. A month after joining \\"Vals Licht\\", Ruud got a phone call from Within Temptation asking him to join their band seeing as to guitarist Michiel Papenhove was quitting. Ruud turned them down because he had just committed himself to \\"Vals Licht\\" and thought it was not proper to \\"jump from tree to tree\\" so quickly. A couple of months later, the late drummer of \\"Vals Licht\\", Johann De Groot, was diagnosed with lung cancer. In that same week, Robert Westerholt, the founder and guitarist of Within Temptation, unaware of Johann's condition called Ruud again with the same request. Ruud turned down Within Temptation once again due to the uneasy circumstances \\"Vals Licht\\" was going through, but in counterpart offered to become Within Temptation's substitute guitarist until they found themselves a permanent member. Within Temptation Jolie during a Within Temptation concert in 2008.In the summer of 2001, Within Temptation had a gig in Mexico City. Ruud, as a substitute, travelled along to perform at the concert. This trip really brought Ruud closer to the members of Within Temptation, and made him realize that he wanted to become a permanent member of the band. Unfortunately, Within Temptation had already hired a 'permanent' guitarist. However, when they returned home, luckily for Ruud, that did not work out, and so he received a third and final phone call from Robert asking him to indefinitely join the band, a request to which Ruud finally agreed. Solo Work In September 2007, Ruud announced his plans for a solo project, entitled \\"For All We Know\\". In a post on his Myspace blog, Ruud said \\"I decided to call it that because I think that name raises all the questions that don't have immediate answers in an instant. And what is more interesting than searching for answers? Everybody is looking for certain answers I guess. Even subconsciously. Therefore it's multi-interpretable. The only questionable thing about the name that might raise some eyebrows instead of questions is when you pronounce the abbreviation of it; FAWK. Ah well, that's just a minor detail... Musically it's going to be heavy in the basics. Very guitar oriented of course. It won't be a shred-fest but guitaristically (if that's even a word) interesting. Some keywords that come to mind right now are; Heavy, Hysterical, Melodic, Atmospherically, Ambient, Groovy, Mellow... Check out my influences in the general info section. Then you see what kind of music I listen to. I guess it's inevitable that some of the 'ingredients' of those bands and artist end up in my own musical stew. And no, it's not going to be something like Within Temptation. What would the use be of doing a side project when it's something like my main band?\\" The first album was released on 25 April 2011. On the second album there are vocal contributions by Anneke van Giersbergen and Wudstik. Maiden uniteD When the Dutch Iron Maiden fan club asked Joey Bruers to do a special show it had to be something other than the regular tribute or cover band. He asked Ruud to join him together with other musicians from several bands to perform a set of rearranged acoustic Maiden songs. The reactions from the crowd were overwhelming. The idea that became a show then became a project. A project to bring all kinds of musicians and fans together to celebrate the music. Maiden uniteD presents classic Iron Maiden songs in a new and exciting light. Acoustic re-arrangements that transform the songs into something that Iron Maiden fans would have never imagined hearing. He's currently recording and producing their third album which should be released in the spring of 2015. Equipment Ruud is an official endorser of Mayones guitars. He uses 6 Regius models (6, 7 and 8 string). He also uses a wide range of Paul Reed Smith guitars, Jackson Guitars and Fender guitars.

A native of Cornwall, Vermont, Foot began working on local farms at age nine, helping support his family after the death of his father. After graduating from Middlebury College, Foot worked as a teacher, school principal, and college professor while studying law. After attaining admission to the bar in 1831, he opened a practice in Rutland. Entering politics as a Whig, Foot served in several offices, including member of the Vermont House of Representatives, delegate to the state constitutional conventions of 1833 and 1836, and Rutland County State's Attorney. He was Vermont's Speaker of the House from 1837 to 1839. Foot served in the United States House of Representatives from 1843 to 1847 and was noted for his opposition to the Mexican–American War and the extension of slavery. He did not run for reelection in 1846; returned to the Vermont House, he served as Speaker from 1847 to 1848. In 1850 Foot was elected to the United States Senate; he became a Republican when the party was founded, and won reelection in 1856 and 1862. Foot served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate during the American Civil War, and was a strong advocate for the Union. He headed the Joint Congressional Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds beginning in 1861, and which included supervising completion of the United States Capitol's construction.

Northern and border state delegates, who had backed Henry Clay or Daniel Webster for President, threatened to run a northern candidate in opposition to Taylor unless a northerner other than Lawrence—one seen as less willing to allow slavery—was selected for Vice President. They proposed Millard Fillmore of New York. Other delegates promoted Fillmore because they opposed the efforts of Weed and William H. Seward to control the party in New York, and believed that Weed was working to install Seward as Secretary of State in a Taylor administration. They backed Fillmore for Vice President because in an era when the President, Vice President and cabinet were expected to reflect geographic balance, if Fillmore became Vice President, another New Yorker (Seward) could not be expected to claim a place in the cabinet. Foot went to the convention as a supporter of Lawrence. Recognizing that the Whigs would likely collapse if Lawrence was nominated and northern delegates left the party, Foot agreed to support Fillmore. Lawrence's support eroded as other northern delegates followed Foot's lead, and on the first ballot, Fillmore had 115 votes and Lawrence 109. Fillmore won the nomination on the second ballot, and the ticket of Taylor and Fillmore went on to win the election. United States Senator Foot was elected to the United States Senate as a Whig in 1850. He became a Republican at the party's founding and was reelected to the Senate in 1856 and 1862. He served from March 4, 1851, until his death. In early 1861 Foot met the Vermont delegates to the Peace Conference which attempted to prevent the start of the American Civil War.Ernest B. Furgurson, Freedom Rising: Washington in the Civil War, 2007, page 38 At this meeting, he shared with them his view that the conference was a sham by secessionists who hoped to obtain additional time to plan for the withdrawal of their states from the Union. Foot was also Chairman of the Senate committee responsible for the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in 1861.The Magazine of History, The Role of Doctors In the Lincoln Administration, 1922, page 33 Foot served as the Senate's President pro tempore from 1861 to 1864.

The etymology of the word hydria was first noted when it was stamped on a hydria itself, its direct translation meaning ‘jug’. It is a type of water-carrying vessel, but it had many other purposes. As time progressed the hydria developed into many forms, some of which were smaller or of a different material. These variants were decorated with detailed figures to represent Greek mythological stories, as well as scenes of daily life, providing extensive insight into Ancient Greek culture and society.  Function  Originally, the hydria’s purpose was for the collection of water, but it also held oil and the votes of judges. The design of the hydria allowed for the efficient collecting and pouring of liquids as it possessed three handles: two horizontal ones at its sides and a vertical one on its back. The shape of the hydria was altered in the 5th century BC from having a wide body and broadly rounded shoulders, to a design that incorporated flatter shoulders that met the body at an angle. This was done to ease the task of carrying water to and from the home and places of gathering. The vessel itself could be carried, and the vertical handle allowed the person to pour it easily, which aided in tasks such as diluting wine in a Krater. The hydria also acted as a funerary urn containing ashes. This function was primarily associated with the hadra hydria. The funerary ceremony was conducted by a royal official who recorded the name of the deceased, their origin, the date of burial and a general inscription. The bronze hydria acted as a prize in tournaments and competitions. This is evident from the painted scenes on vases that illustrate victors carrying a hydria as a reward and inscriptions that identified the bronze hydria as a prize. The high value of a bronze hydria meant it could also function as a dedication to sanctuaries.  Types  thumb = Hydria = The earliest form of the hydria was a large, round shouldered, full-bodied vessel. This shape was commonly used for black- figure pottery during the 6th century BC. Its characteristics included a well- delineated shoulder, an articulated neck and an overhanging ring-shaped (torus) lip. The hydria was manufactured with three handles: two horizontal ones at its sides and a vertical one on its back. It ranged from 33cm to 50cm in height and it was glossed on the outside and not on the inside. alt= = Kalpis = The kalpis became popular during the 5th century BC and became the preferred vessel of choice for red-figure painters. The kalpis differed from the hydria as it was typically smaller in size, ranging from 25cm to 42cm, and its body, shoulder and neck had a continuous curve. Another term associated with a small hydria is hydriske (also called hydriskos, plural hydriskai) which is a diminutive for small hydria. Its vertical handle was cylindrical, attached at the lip rather than the rim, and possessed an in-curved rim compared to the torus lip of the earlier hydria. = Hadra hydria = This style developed during the Hellenistic Period and consisted of a wide squat neck, low pedestal and flaring base. Rather than being cylindrical, the hadra hydria’s vertical handle was ribbed and its side handles were gently curved. They were named hadra hydria after the suburb \\"Hadra\\" in Alexandria, where they were first discovered in the 19th century. There were two sub-classes of hadra hydria, one categorised by a thick layer of whitewash applied for polychrome decoration, a feature that is absent from the other forms of the hydria. These were produced in Egypt and intended to reside in tombs. The second class of hadra hydria are named \\"Clay Ground\\". These differed from whitewashed hadra hydria as they used dark brown or black paint for decoration, which was directly applied to the vessel's surface. \\"Clay Ground\\" hadra hydria were produced in Crete rather than Egypt. = Bronze hydria = Developed from the 4th century BC onwards, the bronze hydria was a prized form of the hydria. It had a shallow neck and a capacious body. It was highly polished and was often decorated with silver inlays. Bronze hydria were also decorated with objects and patterns. For example, one bronze hydria depicted Dionysus and a satyr. Unlike other forms of the hydria, the bronze hydria had a lid, highlighted from the traces of soldering and the presence of rivet holes found on its rim. Having a lid meant the bronze hydria could act as a funerary urn. There are over three hundred and thirty bronze hydria known, including both complete and incomplete vessels.  Manufacturing  = Body = The process began by \\"throwing\\" (from the Old English word thrownاا which means to twist or turn,) the body of the hydria on a potter’s wheel, starting with a large ball of clay. This clay ball would be formed into a tall cylinder and then expanded outwards through the use of the potter’s hands. With one hand on the outside and one on the inside, the potter's hands would press together and form the upward curve of the hydria. At the shoulder level, the potter would smooth the clay inwards, forming the base of the neck. The shoulder was then smoothed out with a rib tool to remove any throwing striations. The body was then cut off the potter's wheel and set aside to harden. = Neck/Mouth/Lip = The neck, mouth and lip were thrown right side up, through a similar process of expanding a smaller lump of clay which was then thinned out and shaped. Once a short cylinder was formed, the clay was then angled outward to form the lip of the hydria. The lip was rounded with a sponge and the neck, mouth and lip were cut off the wheel and left to harden. Similar to the neck amphora, the neck walls of the hydria were also tapered, starting thicker at the base and becoming thinner towards to lip. = Joining = Once the body and neck had dried, they had to be joined. This was completed through the application of a slip between the shoulder and the neck. The potter would place his hand inside the hydria where the shoulder joined the neck and apply the slip which bonded both the neck and the shoulder. The joining was smoothed out to remove any signing that the sections had been joined. = Turning = Once the vessel had dried to a leather hard stage, the potter inverted the hydria and began to turn it to form its base into its parabolic shape. = Foot = The foot was thrown upside down, through a small ball of clay which was spread outwards. The potter would use his thumbs to shape the walls of the foot whilst using his fingers to round the edge of the foot, giving it a torus shape. It was cut off the potter's wheel and left to dry. Once dried, it was attached to the rest of the hydria through the application of a slip. = Handles = The hydria has three handles, two horizontal ones at its sides and a vertical one on its back. The horizontal handles were pulled from balls of clay which were then attached below the shoulder on the hydria. The handles were cylindrical and upturned. The vertical handle was also pulled from a ball of clay but it was centre- ridged and oval shaped. It was attached at the lip and shoulder of the hydria. The handles were then burnished by hand rather than on the potter's wheel. = Bronze hydriai = Beginning with two sheets of bronze, the thin walls of the bronze hydria are hammered and shaped. Bronze hydrias with a pronounced shoulder were hammered in two parts. First, a metal disk was shaped to form a neck. Then, a tube flaring at both ends was welded to where the shoulder met the neck of the hydria. The other parts of the hydria; the foot, handles and mouth were not hammered, but instead cast and attached through welding or soldering. For its decoration, the bronze hydria was polished, as it created a bright sheen and lustre, but silver inlays were also used for its decoration. Its handles were sometimes decorated with patterns or objects, such as palmettes.  Contribution and Examples  The contribution of the hydria is displayed through its decoration and inscriptions. Its decoration often depicted mythological stories and scenes of daily life. The inscriptions provide information such as the potter's name, date and purpose of the hydria. Inscriptions can increase scholarly understanding of Ancient Greek culture, and its development over time, as well as help create a chronological timeline of the development of pottery in Ancient Greece. Decorations can also highlight the particular use of the hydria. For example, bronze hydrias decorated with figures relating to love were gifts to brides, whilst those decorated with Dionysus, were used by men at gala dinner parties. = Caputi hydria = The Caputi hydria provides insight into the role of working women in classical Athens. Due to the lack of written sources surrounding working women in Athens during the 5th century BC, it was noted that women in trades were non-existent and confined to household duties. However, the Caputi hydria depicts women decorating a vase in a pottery workshop, although scholars have debated whether it was a metal workshop. Notwithstanding the academic debate, scholar such as G. M. A. Richter and J. D. Beazley agree this proved the existence of female painters, and women in trades. Hydria. Poseidon and Amymone, with Eros between them. The presence of a Satyr behind Amymone suggests that the scene was probably inspired by a satyr play. From Atalanti. By the Hippolytos Painter. 375-350 B.C. = Inscribed hadra hydria = Inscriptions noted on several hadra hydria in the Metropolitan Museum of Art contain the names of artists, potters, important historical figures and dates. These inscriptions are important as they provide contextual information that helps to establish the date of the pottery which contributes to its chronological timeline. Important figures that existed during that time are also highlighted which can fill information that written sources cannot provide. For example, on one hadra hydria, the inscription translates to \\"Year 9; Sotion son of Kleon of Delphi, Member of the Sacred Embassy announcing the Soteria; by Theodotos, agorastes\\". From this inscription, a date can be approximated, which was 212BC. insight into the political offices that existed is also provided, as well as the names of government officials. = The Friedlaender hydria = This 6th century black figure hydria is decorated with multiple mythological reliefs. On the body of the hydria, it shows Hercules struggle with the Triton (otherwise known as Nereus or the Old Man of the Sea) with Poseidon and Amphitrite watching on the side. Two more figures reside on the left of Hercules, identified as Hermes and Athena, longtime companions of Hercules. On its shoulder, five figures are about to engage in battle. The central figure of the five is a herald, whilst the figures on either side are dressed with Corinthian helmets and armour, holding Boeotian shields. The shoulder relief is reflecting the mythological battle between Hector and Ajax that occurred in the Iliad. The central figure represents the herald Idaios, who tries to interrupt the battle. The reliefs on the Friedlaender hydria and its shape help to place it chronologically in the 6th century BC and establish a timeline for different series of hydrias.

At the Collegium, he taught courses in astronomy and astrology, as he did later at the University, where he got a chair at the Collegium ducale in 1503.Hayton, Darin: \\" Instruments and demonstrations in the astrological curriculum: evidence from the University of Vienna, 1500–1530\\", in Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, 41 (2010), pp. 125-134.

In 1507 or 1508 he became a canon at St. Stephen's, and until his death in 1515 in Vienna he was also parish priest in Stockerau, where he was buried.  Works  At Vienna, Stiborius worked with Georg Tannstetter, who came to Vienna from Ingolstadt in Autumn 1502.Graf- Stuhlhofer, Franz: Humanismus zwischen Hof und Universität. Georg Tannstetter (Collimitius) und sein wissenschaftliches Umfeld im Wien des frühen 16. Jahrhunderts, Vienna: WUV Universitätsverlag 1996, p. 40. . Together they became the most prominent exponents of the \\"Second Viennese School of Mathematics\\" (the first having been the circle around Johann von Gmunden, Georg von Peuerbach, and Regiomontanus). Tannstetter in his Viri Mathematici names both Stabius and Stiborius as his teachers. As editor, Stiborius published an edition of Robert Grosseteste's Libellus Linconiensis de Phisicis lineis, angulis et figuris, per quas omnes acciones naturales complentur in 1503.Europeana: Grosseteste, Robert (author), Stiborius, Andreas (ed.): Libellus Linconiensis de Phisicis lineis, angulis et figuris, per quas omnes acciones naturales complentur., Nuremberg 1503. For Tannstetter's edition Tabulae Eclypsium..., which was published in 1514 and contained tables of eclipses of Georg von Peuerbach and the primi mobilis tables of Regiomontanus, Stiborius wrote two prefaces.Hayton, p. 134. In preparation of the 10th session of the 5th council of the Lateran, Pope Leo X requested in October 1514 from various rulers to have their scientists offer proposals on the calendar reform. Emperor Maximilian gave the task to Stiborius and Tannstetter in Vienna, and to Johannes Stöffler at Tübingen. Stiborius and Tannstetter proposed to omit one leap year every 134 years, and to drop the 19-year metonic cycle used by the Church to calculate the Easter date. Instead of the metonic cycle, they proposed to simply use the true astronomic calculation for the full moon dates to determine Paschal Full Moon. Furthermore, they pointed out that the true astronomic March equinox and full moons, on which the whole calculation of the Easter date and thus other Church holidays was based, would occur at different times, sometimes even different dates in places at different longitudes around the globe, leading to Church holidays falling on different days in different places. They recommended to use universally the equinox at the Meridian of Jerusalem or Rome.Kaltenbrunner, Ferdinand: \\"Die Vorgeschichte der Gregorianischen Kalenderreform\\" in Sitzungsberichte der Philosophisch-Historischen Classe der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 82, Jahrgang 1876, Heft III, Vienna 1876, pp. 289–414. On Tannstetter and Stiborius, see p. 385ff. URL last accessed 2012-11-03. Tanstetter and Stiborius's calendar reform proposal was published as Super requisitione sanctissimi Leonis Papae X. et divi Maximiliani Imp. p.f. Aug. De Romani Calendarii correctione Consilium in Florentissimo studio Viennensi Anustriae conscriptum et aeditum ca. 1515 by the printer Johannes Singriener in Vienna.Graf-Stuhlhofer, p. 125ff. As it turned out, the whole topic of the calendar reform was not even discussed at the fifth Lateran Council.Kaltenbrunner, p. 397. Tannstetter gives in his Viri Mathematici a list of books in Stiborius's library, and also a list of works written by the latter himself. He mentions a five-volume Opus Umbrarum (\\"Work of Shadows\\"), in which Stiborius treated various astronomical and mathematical topics such as cartographic projections, the theory and use of the astrolabe including the saphea, the construction of sundials, and others. The work was the basis of his lectures in Vienna;Hayton, p. 126. it appears never to have been published though.Grössing (1983), p. 175. A partial copy made in 1500 of these lecture notes has survived.

Will Allen Dromgoole (October 26, 1860 – September 1, 1934) was an author and poet born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. She wrote over 7,500 poems; 5,000 essays; and published thirteen books. She was renowned beyond the South; her poem \\"The Bridge Builder\\" was often reprinted. It remains quite popular. An excerpt appears on a plaque at the Bellows Falls, Vermont Vilas Bridge, spanning the Connecticut River between southern Vermont and New Hampshire. Early life and background Will Allen Dromgoole was the last of several daughters born to Rebecca Mildred (Blanche) and John Easter Dromgoole in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.Kathy Lyday- Lee, \\"Will Allen Dromgoole\\", Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture], accessed 20 Jun 2010 Her paternal grandparents were Rev. Thomas and Fanny Dromgoole. Her great-grandparents were Edward Dromgoole, a Scots-Irish minister from Sligo, Ireland, and his wife Rebecca Walton. He married her after immigrating to the North American colonies. Dromgoole's parents sent her to the Clarksville Female Academy, where she graduated in 1876. She studied law with her father, but women were not allowed to become lawyers. She was appointed as staff to the state legislature, where she started working in 1883. Career Dromgoole was a prolific writer, publishing both prose and poetry. She was also a journalist for the Nashville American, a newspaper based in the Middle Tennessee city. She first published a story in Youth's Companion in 1887. It was about the Tennessee governor, Bob Taylor. She had a best-selling novel in 1911, The Island of the Beautiful. Dromgoole taught school in Tennessee one year, and one year in Temple, Texas. There she founded the Waco Women's Press Club. During World War I, Dromgoole was a warrant officer in the United States Naval Reserve. She lectured to sailors on patriotic topics. Dromgoole wrote a series of articles on the Southeastern ethnic group known as the Melungeons, published in the Nashville Daily American (1890) and the Boston Arena (1891).\\"Will Allen Dromgoole\\", Historical Melungeons This historically mixed-race group was then living mostly in northeastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia, and eastern Kentucky.

The genus contains approximately 23 species, most of which are found in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. One species, the Danaid eggfly (H. misippus), is noted for its exceptionally wide distribution across five continents; it is the only Hypolimnas species found in the Americas. Eggflies are known for their marked sexual dimorphism and Batesian mimicry of poisonous milkweed butterflies (Danainae). For example, the Danaid eggfly mimics Danaus chrysippus while the great eggfly (H. bolina) mimics the Australian crow (Euploea core). In each case, the eggfly mimics the danainid's markings, thus adopting the latter's distasteful reputation to predators without being poisonous itself.

They have been used to study several aspects of general family characteristics since the early 1900s but remain a relatively unknown species within the diverse Coleoptera order. Distribution O. disjunctus is most commonly found in climates with higher humidity, mainly in the warmer parts of both hemispheres, and also widely distributed in temperate North American forests. O. disjunctus beetles are usually found under, or inside, old logs or stumps and are rarely observed outside of their wooden habitats. General life history These beetles can be found in rotting logs (oak and hickory especially), this specific locale offers unique benefits in regards to protection from predators and external abiotic factors such temperature and precipitation. There is a level of stability with the two factors mentioned, the water retention in the wood helps to keep temperatures stable while aiding in further decomposition of the log itself. The regulation of this environment allows for both day and night activity. Larvae can reach adulthood in as little as 3 months due to a rich food source, with the average lifespan of an adulthood being up to one year. Adults are only found outside of their log when they are searching for a new mate, or a new log in which to burrow.Daily movements tend to be limited to within their log, any movements outside of the log are not as predictable and occur much less frequently. Biology These beetles are shiny black, and have many long grooves on their elytra. They have a small horn between their eyes, and clubbed antennae. Females and males are difficult to distinguish based on external appearances alone. There appears to be no sexual dimorphism between the two sexes, both tend to be equal in size and overall strength capabilities. large size may be in part a result of exploiting a niche that provides an unlimited food source of rotting wood material. Although flight is possible, these beetles predominantly walk as their main form of locomotion, they will walk long distances rather than flying. Parasitic infections are common but not well known, external and internal parasites have been documented. A nematode parasite, Chondronema passali, inhabits the abdominal cavity has been shown to effect stress responses in these beetles, although the results are relatively small, they do show that O. disjunctus is not only infected by parasites but are negatively impacted by them. Males will often compete for females and territory like most beetle species, using their horn-like structure to flip and overturn their opponents. The strength of these beetles also tends to increase in times of stress, however, even in times without stimulation male beetles will exert an impressive amount of force onto a target. Feeding habits Patent-leather beetles like to eat logs of certain trees, in which the wood is dead and decaying. They eat deciduous trees, such as oaks and elm. Wood inhabited by these beetles is usually well decomposed and falls apart readily. This unique food source prevents competition as these beetles have chosen a food source that is not highly sought after by other organisms due to the material being indigestible for most. Adults feed primarily on wood, while larvae stages eat materials composed of fungi, wood and parental secretions. Burrowing within rotting logs offers the triturated wood that is a staple in the diet of these beetles, this wood is consumed widely by the males and then further broken down through the digestive tract, and eventually expelled for the eventual re- consumption by all family members. Social systems When disturbed, adults can produce a squeaking sound by rubbing their wings on the abdomen. This is called stridulation, and is often easy to hear, both adult and larvae are capable of producing these sounds. This is used for communication within the colony, to communicate danger, courtship, disturbance and solo activities. These four general categories can be further examined into more specific signals and patterns. The acoustic repertoire of O. disjunctus can be broken down into bars, pulses and phonatomes, these are used to identify intra- and interspecific variations. These sounds are produced specifically from when areas of the sixth abdominal tergite rasp against an area on the ventral side of each folded metathoracic wing. Many patent-leather beetles may live together in a colony in the same log and several colonies may be found within the same rotting log depending on the size.However, only one pair of beetles is typically found in a single tunnel/burrow system, but a single large log may offer space for multiple pairs to be present. Reproduction These beetles make tunnels in the wood; inside the galleries, the beetles will mate, lay eggs, and watch over their offspring. The adults feed the larvae a chewed-up mixture of wood chips and feces. The larvae cannot feed themselves and take a year to develop. Being presocial beetles, the larvae are typically taken care of by the parents and young offspring. This cooperative brood care is beneficial to all individuals involved, larvae receive optimal care and young adults are able remain in the burrow to increase fitness and wait for favorable conditions before exiting the log. Offspring rely heavily on parental care for protection and nourishment, food is mixed with secretions by the parent before the larvae can feed. Reproduction appears to be affected by seasonality, with summer months being the time in which females lay majority of their eggs. O. disjunctus remain in monogamous pairs, during the breeding season (early spring until late summer) they will repeatedly copulate and produce anywhere from 20-35 eggs over the time period. Offspring remain in the parental tunnel for the rest of the year, overwinter, and then disperse in the following late spring. Infanticidal behavior has been observed, and is most likely to occur in the event of a burrow take over by a male or female that has not yet had the chance to mate due to limited access to an empty burrow. Anthropological impacts The patent-leather beetle is considered beneficial in its activities to decompose dead wood, and is harmless to humans. The increase in habitat loss due to deforestation for agriculture has caused a decline in populations as they do not react well to fragmentation. Studies reveal that a decrease in suitable habitat and increased open areas between forests have been the two leading causes of population decline and potential extirpation of some areas. Shrinking habitat would also cause an increase in competition and infanticidal behaviors, further straining reproductive success.

It is an international sociological body, gathering both individuals and national sociological organizations. The ISA was founded in 1949 under UNESCO and it has about 4,500 individual and 45 collective members, hailing from 167 countries. Its purpose is to \\"represent sociologists everywhere, regardless of their school of thought, scientific approaches or ideological opinion\\" and its objective is to \\"advance sociological knowledge throughout the world\\". Along with the Institut International de Sociologie (IIS), it is seen as a world leading international sociological organization. ISA is a member of the International Social Science Council with the status of the Non- Governmental Organization in formal associate relations with UNESCO and special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. The ISA's international conference is held every four years, the last of which, the XVIIIth World Congress of Sociology was held in Yokohama, Japan, in July 2014. ISA also organizes a number of smaller conferences, and publishes two peer reviewed academic journals: Current Sociology and International Sociology. ISA's first president (1949–1952) was Louis Wirth. The current president (2018–2022) is Sari Hanafi, Lebanon. Origins Earlier logo of ISA was similar, but used transparent font The history of ISA can be traced to the 1948 initiative of UNESCO's Social Science Department. The initiative was part of a larger plan aiming together to reform the social sciences worldwide, by improving the ties between scholars worldwide \\"to promote research in fields crucial to establishments of a peaceful world order\\". As of 1949, sociological associations existed only in Belgium, Brazil, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States, with about twenty four more countries having sociologist represented in a different type of an institution. The Institut International de Sociologie (IIS), founded in 1893, was deemed too limited, and it was decided that a new organization needs to be created. In the end, representatives from 21 countries were invited for a Constituent Congress, held in Oslo on 5–11 September 1949. The original stated purpose of the organization was \\"to advance sociological knowledge throughout the world\\" through measures including developing \\"personal contacts between sociologists\\" in different regions and encouraging \\"international dissemination and exchange of information\\". A provisional Council was appointed, as were an Executive Secretary, Treasurer, and the Secretariat personnel; statutes were adopted. SA's first president was Louis Wirth. The first ISA conference was planned for 1950. Activities In 1952 ISA begun publishing an academic journal, Current Sociology. 1971 marked the introduction of the official newsletter, the ISA Bulletin. In 1986 ISA launched International Sociology, a peer-reviewed journal published six times annually and provided to all members. International Sociology also has a child publication, a bi-annual International Sociology Review of Books. Other ISA's publications include the book series Sage Studies in International Sociology Books and ISA Handbooks. It also has published its own code of ethics. ISA organizes World Congress of Sociology and Forum of Sociology (every four years). In addition ISA organizes a number of smaller, regional and thematic conferences. Organization The statutes of ISA were first amended during the World Congress at Varna, and were subsequently amended again in 1974 at Toronto, 1978 at Uppsala, 1982 at Mexico City, 1986 at New Delhi, 1994 at Bielefeld and 2010 at Gothenburg. At first, the governing body of ISA was the council of national representatives. The council elected the Executive Committee, which was composed of a President, three Vice-presidents, an Executive Secretary, and six other members. In 1970 ISA allowed general individual membership (previously it focused on organizational membership). Since then, ISA has both individual and collective members. Currently, the Council of National Associations is supplemented by the Research Council, which is composed individual representatives of all Research Committees. The two Councils hold the Assembly of Councils at the Congresses every four years, electing the President and other officials. Scientific activities of the ISA occur under the auspices of research committees that gather sociologists interested in similar subfields or topics within sociology. As of 1997 there were 59 such groups with a total membership of 4442 individuals. The two largest groups at that time were Migration and Social Stratification. As of July 2012, ISA webpages listed 55 Research Committees, 3 Working Groups and 5 Thematic Groups. As of 1994, ISA had 45 national associations as its members. Currently its members come from 167 countries. The ISA Junior Sociologists Network (JSN) is a global network of students, early-career academics and practitioners to share information and create collaborations. ISA offices have changed their location several times; since 1987 they are located are in Madrid, Spain. Although at its beginning, the ISA's budget consisted mainly of UNESCO funds, the modern ISA budget is primarily (90%) composed of membership dues and sales of publications; only 10% comes from grants of UNESCO/ISSC. The ISA is a member of the International Social Science Council with the status of the non-governmental organization in formal associate relations with UNESCO and special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. The recognized languages of the ISA are English, French and Spanish; English is the organization's administrative language. =ISA World Congresses= Since 1962 the ISA World Congress has taken place every four years in a different location; before that period, the Congresses were held every three years. The programme of the association and the number of participants at the congresses have grown rapidly since the first Congress met in Zurich, Switzerland (1950) with about 150 participants; the 1994 congress in Bielefeld, Germany, attracted 3,678 participants. =ISA Forums= The idea of the Forum gathers and redefines the traditionally organized ISA Research Council conference and the interim conferences of ISA Research Committees. It was an event with two kinds of programs: a general program conceived as a dialogue between Research Committees and made up of the papers presented by the RCs’ delegates to the Research Council conference, and the parallel programs of the RCs organized by them. ISA Forums have been held in Barcelona (2008), Buenos Aires (2012), and Vienna (2016). =ISA Award for Excellence in Research and Practice= ISA Award for Excellence in Research and Practice has been established in March 2013. It is awarded to a sociologist who advances and promotes sociological knowledge and practice through outstanding contributions to the discipline, the profession, and the ISA. The award is presented every four years at the World Congress of the International Sociological Association at a special ISA awards ceremony. Immanuel Wallerstein was the first recipient of the award at the ISA World Congress of Sociology, Yokohama, Japan, 2014. =Survey on most influential works in sociology= In 1997, ISA conducted a survey of its membership to identify the 20th century's most influential books in sociology. Members were asked to name the five books that had the most influence on their own professional work. There were 455 respondents (16% of ISA's members), of whom 20.9% named Economy and Society by Max Weber, placing it first on the ISA list. The list was unveiled at the 1998 ISA congress. =List of ISA Presidents= The following individuals held or hold the title of ISA president: # 1949–1952 Louis Wirth, US # 1953–1956 Robert C.

The original Hyundai FB485 and FB500 models later became the benchmark vehicles for a program of constant revision. New models were developed to replace the FB485 and FB500 in 1986, using the same front engine system. The floor height of the new vehicles was lowered, with the supercharged diesel engine tilted over to one side to accommodate this. The FB designs were popular with South Korean bus companies in the 1980s, as considerable financial assistance was available to operators for fleet renewal. However, following the election of a more Conservative government in 1988 and the beginning of recession, demand for new buses declined rapidly and production of the FB range was halted. Only a small number now remain in passenger use in South Korea, but many have been adapted for private use as tour buses and stock car transporters.

DLPAR enables memory, CPU capacity, and I/O interfaces to be moved nondisruptively between LPARs within the same server. DLPAR has been supported by the operating systems AIX and i5/OS on almost all POWER4 and follow-on POWER systems since then. The Linux kernel for POWER also supported DLPAR, but its dynamic reconfiguration capabilities were limited to CPU capacity and PCI devices, but not memory. In October 2009, seven years after the AIX announcement of DLPAR of memory, CPU and IO slots, Linux finally added the capability to DLPAR memory on POWER systems. The fundamentals of DLPAR are described in the IBM Systems Journal paper titled: \\"Dynamic reconfiguration: Basic building blocks for autonomic computing on IBM pSeries Servers. Later on, the POWER5 processor added enhanced DLPAR capabilities, including micro-partitioning: up to 10 LPARs can be configured per processor, with a single multiprocessor server supporting a maximum of 254 LPARs (and thus up to 254 independent operating system instances). There are many interesting applications of DLPAR capabilities. Primarily, it is used to build agile infrastructures, or to automate hardware system resource allocation, planning, and provisioning. This in turn results in increased system utilization. For example, memory, processor or I/O slots can be added, removed or moved to another LPAR, without rebooting the operating system or the application running in an LPAR. IBM DB2 is such application (http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/eserver/articles/db2_dlpar.html), it is aware of the DLPAR events and automatically tunes itself to changing LPAR resources. The IBM Z mainframes and their operating systems, including Linux on IBM Z, support even more sophisticated forms of dynamic LPARs. Relevant LPAR-related features on those mainframe platforms include Intelligent Resource Director, Sysplex, Parallel Sysplex, Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex, and HiperSockets. The System z9 supports up to 60 LPARs on a single server, but mainframes also support an additional level of virtualization using z/VM with the ability to support thousands of operating system instances on a single server.

A solid red flag, signifying the ship’s intent to engage in combat with a Spanish galleon (left ship), flies at the Dutch warship's stern (right ship). The term red flag could mean either a literal flag used for signaling or, as a metaphor, a sign of some particular problem requiring attention. Background Improvised red flag warning about damaged kerb. The earliest citation for \\"red flag\\" in the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1602 and shows that at that time the flag was used by military forces to indicate that they were preparing for battle. The earliest citation of \\"red flag\\" in the sense of a warning is dated 1777 and refers to a flag warning of flood. The term and the expression \\"to raise the red flag\\" come from various usages of real flags throughout history. The semaphore red flag (or red light) on railways means an immediate stop, while a red flag is frequently flown by armed forces to warn the public of live fire exercises in progress, and is sometimes flown by ships carrying munitions (in this context it is actually the flag for the letter B in the International maritime signal flag alphabet, a red swallow-tailed flag). In many countries a red flag is flown to signify that an outdoor shooting range is in use. The United States Air Force refers to its largest annual exercise as red flag operation. Red flags are used for various signals in team sailing races (see Racing Rules of Sailing). A red flag warning is a signal of high wildfire danger and a red flag on the beach warns of dangerous water conditions (double red flags indicate beach closure). Red flags of various designs indicate dangerous wind and wave conditions for mariners. In auto racing, a red flag indicates a stop to the race due to dangerous conditions. A signal of danger or a problem can be referred to as a red flag, a usage that originated in the 18th century. An infamous example of use of a red flag in warfare is Mexican General Santa Anna's use of the symbol to let his Texian opposition in the Alamo know that he intended to spare none of the defenders (on which he followed through). The term \\"red flag\\" is used, e.g., during screening of communications, and refers to specific words or phrases encountered that might indicate relevance to the case. For example, email spam filters make use of such \\"red flags\\".

It has a narrow body and one handle attached to the neck of the vessel, and is thus a narrow type of jug, with no pouring lip; the oinochoe is more like a modern jug. In the \\"shoulder\\" and \\"cylindrical\\" types which became the most common, especially the latter, the sides of the body are usually vertical by the shoulder, and there is then a sharp change of direction as the neck curves in; the base and lip are normally prominent and flared. However, there are a number of varieties, and the word seems to have been used even more widely in ancient times than by modern archeologists.Beazley They are normally in pottery, but there are also carved stone examples. Lekythoi were especially associated with funerary rites, and with the white ground technique of vase painting, which was too fragile for most items in regular use. Because of their handle they were normally only decorated with one image, on the other side from the handle;Woodford, 12-13 they are often photographed with the handle hidden, to show the painted image. Function white ground lekythos, c. 490 BC, Achilles dragging the body of Hector The lekythos was used for anointing dead bodies of unmarried women and many lekythoi are found in tombs. The images on lekythoi were often depictions of daily activities or rituals. Because they are so often used in funerary situations, they may also depict funerary rites, a scene of loss, or a sense of departure as a form of funerary art. These drawings are usually outline drawings that are quite expressionless and somber in appearance. The decoration of these ceramic vessels consists of a dull red and black paint. These colors may have been derived from the Bronze Age, but were not used until 530 BC in Athens. Many artists of these vessels attempted to add more color to the figures, but later abandoned the idea, which provides more of a contrast. These vessels were very popular during the 5th century BC, however there are many that have been found dating all the way back to 700 BC. They contained a perfumed oil which was offered either to the dead person or to the gods of the underworld. Some lekythoi were fitted with a small, inner chamber so that they might appear full, while in reality they contained only a small amount of the expensive oil.Beazley The Lekythos was used to smear perfumed oil on a woman's skin prior to getting married and were often placed in tombs of unmarried women to allow them to prepare for a wedding in the afterlife. Types Lekythoi can be divided into five types: * the standard or cylindrical lekythos, which measures between 30 and 50 cm though there are much larger \\"huge lekythoi\\", up to 1 m, which may have been used to replace funerary stele,Beazley * the Deianeria lekythos which originates from Corinth, this form has an oval profile and a round shoulder and is generally of a small size (20 cm), it was produced from the beginning of the black figure period until the late 6th century, * the shoulder or secondary lekythos, a variation on the standard type produced from the mid 5th century on. These have a fuller, swelling body;Beazley most are decorated with the white ground technique and measure around 20 cm, * the squat lekythos, usually less than 20 cm in height with a rounded belly and a flat base, * the acorn lekythos, a rarer form, which has an oval profile and at the bottom of the body a raised cup with protrusions, like the cup of an acorn. There are also \\"plastic\\" lekythoi, with bodies formed in the shape of a head, animal, or other form.

Also known as Riverside Road, the route serves the Riverside townsite, the town of Bunkerville and the city of Mesquite. The highway was previously a part of former U.S. Route 91 (US 91). Route description View from the west end of SR 170 looking eastbound in 2015 SR 170 crossing the Virgin River looking north toward Mesquite in 2007 SR 170 begins at the Interstate 15 (I-15) Riverside interchange (exit 112), approximately northwest of Las Vegas in Virgin Valley. From there, the two-lane highway meanders southeasterly approximately before reaching the Riverside townsite and the Virgin River. The route crosses the river, then turns northeasterly to somewhat parallel the south side of the river. The highway travels about before reaching the town of Bunkerville. After another , the highway turns due north, crosses the Virgin River again, and enters the city of Mesquite. The highway travels about northward through the southern portion of the city before ending at an intersection with Mesquite Boulevard (former SR 144). History A gravel road approximating the alignment of present-day SR 170 appeared on official state maps by 1933. This road was marked as part of State Route 6 and U.S. Route 91—these designations traversed the southern portion of the state from the California state line to the Arizona state line at Mesquite via Las Vegas. The road in this area was fully paved by 1934. By 1955, a shorter, multi-lane highway had been constructed to bypass Bunkerville to the northwest. US 91 (and SR 6) were relocated from Riverside Road to the new alignment, which would later become I-15. In 1976, the Nevada Department of Transportation began an effort to renumber its state highways. In this process, Riverside Road would again be designated a state highway, State Route 170. This designation was applied on July 1, 1976, and was first seen on state highway maps in 1978. The route has remained relatively unchanged since.

It sits north of the city's convention center and west of Laclede's Landing. The area is part of the old Kerry Patch neighborhood, which was home to thousands of Irish immigrants in the 19th century. The neighborhood gradually became more industrial and was noted in the 1920s for its animal stockyards and bottling companies. In 2004, longtime neighborhood business McGuire Moving and Storage Company, announced plans to redevelop the district as an entertainment destination. Noted architect Daniel Libeskind was hired to design the district. The Ghazi Company of Charlotte, North Carolina is the co-developer. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 27, 2005, with plans for the first phase to open in 2007. The plans called for a Rawlings Sports museum, a Grand Prix Speedways kart-racing center, a boutique bowling alley, 250 residential units, and several restaurants. The first phase of the development was anticipated to cost $290 million, to be funded in part by $51.3 million in tax increment financing. But that effort stalled. In late 2011, the St. Louis Board of Aldermen approved the transfer of the unused $51.3 million to a new developer, NorthSide Regeneration LLC. The deal would see the previous investment group, including developers Larry Chapman and Clayco, sell the site to NorthSide for an undisclosed amount that documents with the city suggest would be $3 million; all three were to work to find tenants and build on the site. Construction on a $190 million office and residential project was to begin in summer 2012. Several explanations for the name of the Bottle District have been given. It has been suggested that the name honors the longstanding connection between St. Louis and the brewing and bottling industries. Others have suggested that the name comes from bottles found buried on the property, or the many broken bottles found in the neighborhood. Finally, the site is noted for a decades-old, advertisement for Vess Soda, shaped like a bottle, which the developers intend to restore during the redevelopment.

Festival poster The promotional poster for the festival was one of three such posters designed by artist Lance Bragg to advertise the three successive pop festivals promoted by Alex Cooley: the first Atlanta Pop Festival and the Texas International Pop Festival, both in 1969, and the Second Atlanta Pop Festival in 1970 – all of which featured a similar design motif. The posters for both Atlanta festivals are featured in the book The Art of Rock, which states, \\"The success of large-scale festivals, like the two Atlanta International Pop Festivals… helped create a new image for Southern rock.\\"Grushkin, Paul.

On September 15, 2012, a ceremony was held near the site of the festival to unveil and dedicate an official historical marker commemorating the event. The marker text reads: \\"In the 1960s, as American culture changed rapidly, new forms of music and performance emerged, including large outdoor rock festivals. From July 3–5, 1970, the Second Atlanta International Pop Festival, one of the largest such events anywhere in the world during that era, took place in a field 600 yards west of here. Over thirty musical acts performed, including rock icon Jimi Hendrix playing to the largest American audience of his career, and Macon's Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame. Officials estimated that the festival drew several hundred thousand young people to Byron that weekend. Organized by renowned Atlanta concert promoter Alex Cooley, it remains one of the largest public gatherings in state history.\\"Kulkosky, Victor.

The marker dedication ceremony was hosted by festival site landowner Tim Thornton, and featured Cooley, Byron Mayor Larry Collins, officials of the sponsoring organizations, and a crowd of festival attendees and fans. Documentary film Also on September 15, 2012, the first audience test screening of a full-length documentary film on the festival was held in Macon, GA, by the film's director, Steve Rash. A second test screening was held two nights later in Atlanta. On July 30, 2014, two more test screenings were held at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. The film features performances by most of the major musical acts appearing during the festival, as well as significant coverage of festival attendees, local residents, and the many other activities that swirled around the festival. Rash is re-editing the film based on feedback received during the screenings, and plans an eventual public release.Thornton, Tim. (2012-09-05). \\"Marker, Film to Honor Byron Pop Festival\\".

The film is a film adaptation of Les Liaisons dangereuses, a novel written in 1782 by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos. Set in the fashion industry of modern-day New York City, Lucas inserted pornographic scenes into the common themes of lust and deceit for the plot of his X-rated version. A documentary of the film, More Dangerous: The Making of Michael Lucas' Dangerous Liaisons, premiered at the 2006 Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival on July 22, 2006. Plot Michael Lucas plays Marcus Von Halpern, head of a New York fashion empire with a manipulative side, who enlists the help of Valentine Moore, played by Gus Mattox. Von Halpern wants Moore, a world-renowned photographer and \\"player\\", to seduce Sebastian Lacroix (Wilfried Knight), the new lover of Von Halpern's ex-boyfriend, Tom Mercedes (Kent Larson). Moore agrees on one condition: he gets a night with Von Halpern as his reward. Lacroix receives a call from his modeling agent informing him that he's booked for a photo-shoot with Moore. His boyfriend, Mercedes, warns Lacroix about Moore's reputation and advises him that Moore is not trustworthy. This segues into the first sex scene of the film, with Lacroix and Mercedes each topping the other in a flip-flop encounter. In the following scene, Mercedes is seduced by his employee Matt Cody (Owen Hawk). They engage in sexual activity on the conference table in the boardroom when the cleaning guy (Mario Ortiz) shows up and joins in. Meanwhile, Moore sets up his photography session with Lacroix and engages another model, J., to seduce Lacroix. Lacroix is later guilt-ridden. Cody meets with Von Halpern, who wants to solicit information about Cody's boss, Von Halpern's ex-boyfriend, Mercedes. Another sex scene ensues. Von Halpern's current boyfriend Bobby (Bruce Beckham) discovers Von Halpern's infidelity and seduces Moore to get even. Since Von Halpern has reneged on his payment to Moore in the form of a night together, Moore responds favorably to Bobby's advances. The cameo appearances occur during the final scene, set as the opening night of Moore's new gallery exhibit. There is an additional plot twist as a main character is murdered at the end.

Summary The series starred Alison Lohman as Lily McAllister, an initially naïve young woman who witnesses a stranger's suicide and begins to investigate the secrets being hidden by her own very wealthy California family, the Greeleys. Other cast members included Dana Delany and Martin Donovan as Lily's parents, Will and Catherine McAllister, and Chris Marquette as Lily's brother Mason. Mark Valley, Balthazar Getty, and Natasha Gregson Wagner portrayed Catherine's siblings Robert, Nate, and Beth Greeley, while Philip Baker Hall and Barbara Babcock played Greeley patriarch and matriarch George and Lillian.

Actress/director Diane Keaton directed the pilot episode, and was among the show's executive producers. Other producers included Mark B. Perry, Dana Baratta, R. W. Goodwin, and Bill Robinson. The pilot was edited by Tatiana S. Riegel. =Cancellation= Although the show was critically acclaimed, it was watched by only 4.3 million viewers. The general speculation at the time was that, with the series having premiered two weeks after the September 11, 2001 attacks, American audiences were not willing to watch a show like Pasadena, with its dark atmosphere and cynical storylines. Episodes Broadcast and syndication Only four episodes were originally aired in the U.S. in 2001, though thirteen were filmed, with the last episode seemingly resolving the central mystery of the series. In late 2005, the series was shown in its entirety for the first time in the United States, on the cable channel SoapNet. In 2003 and 2004, all thirteen episodes were aired in various countries such as Romania (by the public television TVR 1), Bulgaria (BTV Channel), Colombia, Croatia, México, Serbia, Slovakia, New Zealand, Finland, Denmark, Russia, South Africa (on the pay channel M-Net), Israel (on cable Channel 3) and China. It began airing in Belgium on June 27, 2010 on Club RTL. Home media Mill Creek Entertainment announced the series on DVD.

First opened in 1980, it has a 3,500-seat arena, gymnasia, squash and badminton courts, and a multi-purpose hall. It was built by the Urban Council, and is now managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong Government.  History  Queen Elizabeth II made her first visit to Hong Kong, then a British colony, in May 1975. This Royal Visit became the namesake of the stadium. The construction was funded by various means including donations from local philanthropists such as Sir Tang Shiu-kin, and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club. The foundation stone was laid by the Acting Governor Sir Denys Roberts on 21 December 1977. The stadium was opened by the Governor Sir Murray MacLehose on 27 August 1980. Since then the stadium has become one of the major venues for cultural and sports activities in Hong Kong. Popular culture Japanese pop singer Kenji Sawada, widely popular across Asia at the time, was one of the first artists to use the stadium as a concert venue (December 1980, just four months after its opening), followed by Taiwanese pop singer Teresa Teng in 1982. Many successful home-grown artists and pop stars also held concerts at the venue including George Lam, Michael Kwan, Danny Chan, Alan Tam, Samuel Hui and Beyond (band) (See 1970s and 1980s in Hong Kong). However, the stadium's status as the top concert venue in Hong Kong, or even Asia, was gradually eclipsed by the larger stadium Hong Kong Coliseum. The stadium is also one of the major venues during the 2009 East Asian Games.

It was similar to the Popular Fronts of Latvia and Estonia, and the Sąjūdis movement in the Republic of Lithuania. Creation The Belarusian Popular Front was established in 1989, following the examples of the Popular Fronts in the Baltic states. Its founding conference had to be organized in Vilnius because of pressure from the authorities of the Belarusian SSR. Initially, the Popular Front united numerous minor organizations promoting the Belarusian language and history. However, soon the movement began voicing political demands, supporting the Perestroika and democratization in the Soviet Union which would enable a Belarusian national revival. The Popular Front was the first political organization in Belarus to openly oppose the Communist Party of Byelorussia. The prominent Belarusian writer Vasil Bykaŭ became an active member of the Belarusian Popular Front. Writer Aleś Adamovič was an active supporter of the Popular Front. The Front had about 10 thousand activists in different regions of Belarus as well as in Moscow, Vilnius and Riga. It published a newspaper, Навіны БНФ \\"Адраджэньне\\" (News of the Belarusian Popular Front \\"Renaissance\\" ). Among the significant achievements of the Front was the uncovering of the burial site of Kurapaty near Minsk, a major NKVD mass extermination sites of Soviet political prisoners in the 1930s. The Belarusian Popular Front actively protested against Soviet policies following the Chernobyl accident, after which a large territory of Belarus was contaminated by nuclear fallout. The Belarusian Popular Front in the parliament of Belarus In May 1990, 37 members of the Belarusian Popular Front were elected into the 12th Belarusian Supreme Council and formed a dynamic opposition group in the parliament of the then Soviet-controlled Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. In July 1990, the Belarusian Popular Front initiated the passing of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. In August 1991, following the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt and supported by tens of thousands of protesters outside the parliament building, the Belarusian Popular Front has managed to convince the Supreme Soviet to declare full independence of Belarus from the USSR. The historical Belarusian national symbols: the white-red-white flag and the Pahonia coat of arms were restored as state symbols of Belarus. A meeting in Kurapaty in 1989 organized by the Belarusian Popular Front Opposition to the regime of Alexander Lukashenko In 1994, Alexander Lukashenko was elected president of Belarus. From the very beginning, the Belarusian Popular Front became one of the main political forces opposing president Lukashenko. In 1994 the BPF formed a shadow cabinet consisting of 100 BPF intellectuals. In 1995, members of parliament from the Belarusian Popular Front went on a hunger strike as a protest against Lukashenko's controversial referendum to replace state symbols by slightly amended Soviet ones and to make Russian language official in Belarus. The hunger strike was violently interrupted by police forces who beat up the members of parliament. In 1996, the Belarusian Popular Front was one of the main powers behind mass protests against Lukashenko's policies of russification and integration with Russia, as well as against his second controversial referendum amending the Constitution in a way to concentrate power in the president's hands. The protests were violently dispersed by the police. Two leaders of the Belarusian Popular Front, Zianon Pazniak and Siarhiej Navumčyk, have fled the country and received political asylum in the United States. Split In the late 1990s the Belarusian Popular Front split in two rivaling organizations. Its conservative wing under the exiled leader Zianon Pazniak formed the Conservative Christian Party – BPF (Kanservatyŭna- Chryścijanskaja Partyja BNF), while the moderate majority formed the BPF Party (Partyja BNF, Партыя БНФ) led by Vincuk Viačorka. Both parties claim to be the only legitimate successor of the Belarusian Popular Front established in 1989. The Malady Front, formerly the Popular Front's youth organization, has also become an autonomous organization. In 2011, following an internal conflict, more than 90 further members left BPF Party, including several prominent veterans of the original Belarusian Popular Front, such as Lavon Barščevski, Jury Chadyka, Vincuk Viačorka. This was sometimes described as a \\"second split\\" of the Belarusian Popular Front. Formally, the Belarusian Popular Front continues to exist as an NGO affiliated with the BPF Party.СТАТУТ ГРАМАДСКАГА АБ’ЯДНАННЯ БНФ \\"АДРАДЖЭНЬНЕ\\" (Statute of the NGO BPF Renaissance as at 2012) Notable former members * Vasil Bykaŭ, writer, Nobel prize nominee * Ryhor Baradulin, poet and writer, Nobel prize nominee * Siarhiej Navumčyk, vice President of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in Exile * Aleś Bialacki, human rights activist and political prisoner * Piatro Sadoŭski, first ambassador of Belarus to Germany * Pavał Sieviaryniec, Christian Democratic politician and political prisoner * Jaŭhien Kulik, graphic designer, author of the Coat of arms of Belarus adopted in 1991 * Uładzimier Arłoŭ, writer * Jaŭhien Šatochin, artist See also * People's Movement of Ukraine * Popular Front of Latvia * Popular Front of Estonia * Sąjūdis References External links * The Belarusian Popular Front in 1988—1996: photo and video * НАРОДНЫ ФРОНТ.

Early life Born in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, the son of a Scottish Shell employee, he grew up near Perth, going on to study at Cheltenham Art College, where he supplemented his maintenance grant by playing piano in a local restaurant. Career On graduation he moved to London, and began working as assistant to the Australian fashion consultant Percy Savage. When the Gentlemen's Quarterly (GQ) was founded in 1988, Morgan was signed up as a style writer, eventually rising to become style editor. He is perhaps best remembered for his column in The Times, \\"Morgan's Manners.\\" Morgan defined good manners as the path of least offence. His Saturday column ran for three years,. Readers would write in with problems pertaining to social nuances. A typical column would see someone concerned that they were being sent generic circulars by a friend, another expressing vexation with a friend who has decided to act in an eccentric manner upon retirement and ceased replying to dinner invitations. Letters would relate to which piece of cutlery to use, and how to hold it, and proper guest-host interaction. Morgan also addressed thornier subjects such as the handing back of engagement rings and wedding presents if things did not go to plan. Morgan was noted for informative and witty responses. The column proved very popular throughout its run. Other work Morgan was also the author of Debrett's Etiquette and Modern Manners, published by etiquette specialists Debrett's in 1996 and republished in 1999. Personal life Morgan dedicated himself to living the life of a Mayfair boulevardier, and lived in a flat in The Albany just off Piccadilly, which contained: 60 made-to-measure Savile Row suits; 300 monogrammed shirts; and 90 pairs of shoes. He cashed his cheques at Claridge's and was passionate about opera. Morgan was \\"almost certainly homosexual\\".

He is also a comics writer and artist, with works including Superosity, Sore Thumbs, and Snap, the Punk Turtle.  Early work  In an interview, Crosby said he had been interested in comics since before he was old enough to remember. He first published a webcomic in 1995 through his AOL account. He also self-published some issues of a comic called Snap, the Punk Turtle, which he says got him attention at Wizard, leading to coverage and then a gig writing a webcomic for AnotherUniverse.com's Mania magazine. After Mania stopped running webcomics in 1998, Crosby decided to start his own daily webcomic, which would be Superosity. Around this time, Crosby was one of the writers on a print comic book series called Scorn. Three issues were published by SCC Entertainment: Scorn: Deadly Rebellion #0 (July 1996), Scorn: Heatwave #1 (January 1997), and Scorn: Naked Truth #1 (April 1997). The series follows the adventures of a super-powered warrior woman called Scorn who fights for freedom against an evil empire known as The Rulemakers. According to Diamond Comic Distributors' sales charts for January 1997, Scorn: Heatwave #1 sold an estimated 3,439 copies in that month.  Superosity  Crosby is the writer and artist of Superosity, a daily comic that he launched on March 1, 1999. In a 2003 interview, Crosby described his comic as \\"a storyline-focused strip, packed with wacky insane humor... about the friendship between a group of unusual characters.\\" The main character is also named Chris, who Crosby described as \\"an ever-optimistic, childlike guy who is not very smart and wears a big orange cape.\\" Other characters include Boardy, a talking blue board who has amnesia but is a scientific genius, and Bobby, Chris's teenage brother, who hates everything and wants to be rich and famous. Bobby's best friend is a talking turtle named Snap, one of many characters brought over from earlier Crosby strips. The cast also features Arcadia, a young female lawyer who Chris is in love with. According to a 2003 Comicon article, Superosity \\"has been called a cross between The Simpsons and Bloom County.\\" According to Keenspot, Superosity was reviewed in Comics Buyer's Guide in late 2001, which said it \\"may be one of the most off-the-wall online comics\\", calling the humor \\"non-sequitur\\" and said \\"the art is cringe-worthy at first, but... improved with age.\\" Superosity was nominated for a 2002 Cartoonist Choice Award in the Best Superhero Comic category. Seven issues of a Superosity print comic book were published from 2001–2002 and distributed by Diamond Comic Distributors to comic book stores. It featured guest artwork by creators such as Jeffrey J. Rowland (Overcompensating) and John Allison (Scary Go Round). Superosity has also been published in newspapers, most notably The Turlock Journal of Turlock, CA. As of October 2020, Superosity is still updating daily. = Adaptation = On July 21, 2006 at Comic-Con International it was announced that an animated TV series called 'Angelipups' would be produced, based on the fictional 'Angelipups' TV show that appears in Superocity. Angelipups are a group of winged, candy-colored puppies who live in the sky and are responsible for keeping clouds fluffy; the in-comic TV show combines surreal humor with moral and educational elements. Crosby had written the pilot script and was commissioned to write more episodes. It is unclear if this TV show was ever produced.  Keenspot  Chris Crosby was a co-founder of Keenspot, an online comic network. He cofounded the business in March 2000 with Teri Crosby, Darren Bleuel, and Nate Stone. According to writer T Campbell, Crosby had previously been hosting his comic Superosity on a site called Big Panda. Big Panda had been facing problems and its founder Bryan McNett offered control of Big Panda to Crosby in exchange for a cut of profits. Crosby agreed, but no deal could be reached. Through the Big Panda mailing list, Crosby made contact with Darren Bleuel and together they designed \\"Big Panda but better\\". Together with Bleuel's partner Stone and Chris's mother Teri, they founded Keenspot. Crosby's Superocity was the first comic on Keenspot, due to McNett's decision to remove the comic from Big Panda with four days' notice. Keenspot's founders wished to provide a steady place for readers to find webcomics, and to attract large advertisers and get them to sponsor Keenspot and its cartoonists, with the goal of every Keenspot cartoonist eventually making a living through such sponsorship. Keenspot also launched Keenspace in 2000, a free webhosting service for cartoonists. As of 2003, it was an online entertainment network which in which Keenspot featured more than forty of the higher-quality comic strips and cartoons on the web and Keenspace hosted over 1,000 other cartoonists. In 2002, Keenspot had almost forty million page views per month and nearly two million unique visitors per month. Chris Crosby, along with his mother Teri Crosby, bought out the other two co-founders in 2008. According to the Keenspot website as of October 2020, Chris Crosby is the Chief Executive Officer of Keenspot.  Sore Thumbs  Crosby started writing the webcomic Sore Thumbs in collaboration with artist Owen Gieni in 2004. The main character, Cecania, is forced by her mother to work in a video game store, Sore Thumbs, which is run by her extremely- Republican brother Fairbanks, selling only safe, non-violent, non-suggestive video games. Other characters include Cecania's best friend, a former doctor named Harmony; Sawyer Kaden, a soldier who lost his penis in the second Gulf War; and bear named Gary Coleman. Reviewing the comic for Sequential Tart in 2004, Rebecca Henely gave it 4 out of 10, saying that despite being left-wing like the strip, she found the comic dumb, saying that \\"[i]ts potshots at conservatives are both incredibly obvious and not particularly biting.\\" She called the jokes \\"stale\\", the characters \\"uniformly unlikable\\", and the dialogue \\"awful\\". She praised the art, but overall called the comic \\"unintelligent, uncreative and worst of all — it's not very funny.\\" Also in 2004, reviewer Wednesday White said the art was \\"serviceable\\" and the \\"story shows potential here and there\\", but criticised its \\"hamhanded dialogue\\", saying \\"[e]veryone speaks like they’re being scored on how many references they make to their assigned passions.\\" White felt that \\"Fairbanks, in particular, grates... he’s a caricature of an exaggeration of a Republican’s idea of a left-wing stereotype of a Republican\\". She felt the comic could develop, saying, \\"[g]iven time, the characters could go from extrusions of perceptions of stereotypes to cartoons. It appears that the last update of Sore Thumbs, apart from using the site to posts ads, was in 2014.  Other work  Chris Crosby co-founded the comic book publisher Blatant Comics in 1997. As of 2013, Crosby was chief technical officer at Red Giant Entertainment. He appears to have still been with the company as recently as 2017.

For the connection bar used in railways, see Fishplate. By the Scorpion Fish Painter, 380-75 BC Three sea-perch and three limpets, Apulian red-figured fish plate, ca. 340–320 BC, British Museum Campania, 325-290 BC 380-75 BC A fish plate is a Greek pottery vessel used by western, Hellenistic Greeks during the fourth century BC. Although invented in fifth-century BC Athens, most of the corpus of surviving painted fish plates originate in Southern Italy, where fourth-century BC Greek settlers, called \\"Italiotes,\\" manufactured them. The name \\"fish plate\\" comes from their usual decoration of seafood items which includes various fish and other marine creatures. Fishes depicted include bream, perch, torpedo fish, tuna, flying fish, puffer fish, scorpion fish, squid, cuttlefish, octopus, scallop, clam, dentalia, murex, sea snail, shrimp, crab, dolphin, hippocamp, etc. Form The form of the plate was called a \\"pinax\\" or \\"pinakion\\", meaning \\"tablet,\\" because of its flat shape. The fish plate's form was that of a dimpled disk elevated on a pedestal, in other words, round and flat with a small cup in the center of plate designed to hold oil or sauce. Its rim was turned down, and often bears a decorative border, either spiraling waves, Greek key and meander motifs, or a wreath of laurel leaves. A fish plate is almost always also elevated above table level by a pedestal foot. Plates of this form are known since Minoan times (Pre-Greek), but they were not decorated with fish until the end of the fifth century BC. History Fish plates were first produced in Athens during the late fifth century BC. These Attic fish plates are characterized by fish whose bellies are oriented towards the outside rim of the plate. In Athens the palette was restricted to red clay fabric and black gloss slip with rare uses of white overpainting. Later, Italiote Greek settlers in Southern Italy began to mass-produce more colorful fish plates in Taranto (Greek \\"Taras\\"), Paestum (Greek \\"Poseidonia\\"), Capua (Etruscan \\"Capue\\"), and Cumae (Greek \\"Kyme\\"). The South Italian fish plates are characterized by decoration in which the fish's bellies are oriented towards the sauce cup at the center of the plate. Fabrics Fish plates can be classified by the workshops that made them. Attic fishplates were manufactured in the Kerameikos district of Athens, Greece; Apulian fish plates were manufactured in various workshops in Taranto (Taras) on the \\"heel of the boot\\" of Italy; Campanian fish plates come from the region of the Bay of Naples, Italy (There were fabrics in both Capua and Cumae (Kyme)); Paestan fabrics were made in Paestum (Poseidonia), south of Salerno, Italy (These are the only fish plates signed by the artists, coming from the workshops of Python and Asteas.). Fish plates were made in almost all South Italian ceramic fabrics except for those in Lucania (on the Gulf of Taranto, the \\"arch of the boot\\" of Italy). For illustrations of fish plates made by these fabrics, see the external links at the end of this article. Decoration All painted fish plates are red figure ware, meaning that the creatures are left in reserve, while the body of the vessel is largely painted in black glaze. Then dilute glaze and white overpainting were applied. Sometimes, in the South Italian examples the palette is enlarged to include deep red, pink, and yellow overpainting as well. This polychrome technique with its chiaroscuro (highlights and lowlights) is called \\"sovradipinto.\\" Many of the creatures pre-evidence the trompe l'oeil art characteristic of later, Graeco-Roman painting and mosaics found at Pompeii and other Roman resorts in Magna Graecia (Greek-speaking Southern Italy). Some contend that fish plates were decorated with pictures of the seafood they were intended to hold. Most of them, however, have been found in mortuary contexts, so it might be surmised that the fish images could represent symbolic offerings for the dead. On the other hand, these plates could just as well be objects which were in popular use among the living, placed in tombs for the deceased to continue using in the hereafter. At any rate the small size of these plates could not realistically afford some of the large aquatic animals represented upon them, and the decoration must therefore be regarded as artistic or symbolic compositions rather than pictures of actual food items on the plates. The type without painted decoration continues throughout much of the Greek world until the late Hellenistic period. Bibliography *South Italian Vase Painting by A.D.

Edinburgh Place () is a public square in Central, Hong Kong, adjacent to the Victoria Harbour. The Hong Kong City Hall is located in the square. In addition, the Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier and Queen's Pier were also located in the square before they were demolished in early 2007. History The Edinburgh Place complex, which included the City Hall and the Memorial gardens were designed by British architects Ron Phillips and Alan Fitch in 1956 for the most important civic functions of the city. The Star Ferry Pier was designed by a local architect Hung Yip Chan (born 1921). He worked in the Architectural Office (AO) of the former Public Works Department from 1952–1957 as an assistant architect. He designed the facade of the pier, and the Chief Architect, Michael Wright, added the Clock Tower to make the pier more balanced. Queen's Pier, completed in 1954, was \\"an integral part\\" of the cluster: the entrance to the City Hall formed an axis with the Pier to lend a sense of occasion to visiting dignitaries. From the completion of City Hall in 1962, each arriving new Governor would land at Queen's Pier, and they would hold an inspection of the Guard of honour in Edinburgh Place before being sworn in nearby in the City Hall.Annexe B3 , EIA: A survey report of Historical Buildings and Structures within the Project Area of the Central Reclamation Phase III, Chan Sui San Peter for the HK Government, February 2001 The Star Ferry Pier was completed in 1957.

It occurs in all living organisms, and is one of the most evolutionarily conserved properties of RNAs. RNA editing may include the insertion, deletion, and base substitution of nucleotides within the RNA molecule. RNA editing is relatively rare, with common forms of RNA processing (e.g. splicing, 5'-capping, and 3'-polyadenylation) not usually considered as editing. It can affect the activity, localization as well as stability of RNAs, and has been linked with human diseases. RNA editing has been observed in some tRNA, rRNA, mRNA, or miRNA molecules of eukaryotes and their viruses, archaea, and prokaryotes. RNA editing occurs in the cell nucleus and cytosol, as well as within mitochondria and plastids. In vertebrates, editing is rare and usually consists of a small number of changes to the sequence of the affected molecules. In other organisms, such as squids, extensive editing (pan-editing) can occur; in some cases the majority of nucleotides in an mRNA sequence may result from editing. More than 160 types of RNA modifications have been described so far. RNA- editing processes show great molecular diversity, and some appear to be evolutionarily recent acquisitions that arose independently. The diversity of RNA editing phenomena includes nucleobase modifications such as cytidine (C) to uridine (U) and adenosine (A) to inosine (I) deaminations, as well as non- template nucleotide additions and insertions. RNA editing in mRNAs effectively alters the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein so that it differs from that predicted by the genomic DNA sequence. The Editosome Complex  Detection of RNA editing  = Next generation sequencing = To identify diverse post- transcriptional modifications of RNA molecules and determine the transcriptome-wide landscape of RNA modifications by means of next generation RNA sequencing, recently many studies have developed conventional\\"Accurate Mapping of tRNA Reads\\"; Anne Hoffmann et al.; Bioinformatics, btx756, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx756 or specialised sequencing methods. Examples of specialised methods are MeRIP-seq, m6A-seq, methylation- iCLIP, m6A-CLIP, Pseudo-seq, Ψ-seq, CeU-seq, Aza-IP and RiboMeth-seq). Application of these methods have identified various modifications (e.g. pseudouridine, m6A, m5C, 2′-O-Me) within coding genes and non-coding genes (e.g. tRNA, lncRNAs, microRNAs) at single nucleotide or very high resolution. = Mass Spectrometry = Mass spectrometry is a way to qualitatively and (relatively) quantify RNA modifications. More often than not, modifications cause an increase in mass for a given nucleoside. This gives a characteristic readout for the nucleoside and the modified counterpart. Moreover, mass spectrometry allows the investigation of modification dynamics by labeling RNA molecules with stable (non-radioactive) heavy isotopes in vivo. Due to the defined mass increase of heavy isotope labeled nucleosides they can be distinguished from their respective unlabeled isotopomeres by mass spectrometry. This method, called NAIL-MS (nucleic acid isotope labeling coupled mass spectrometry), enables a variety of approaches to investigate RNA modification dynamics.  Types of RNA  = Messenger RNA modification = Recently, functional experiments have revealed many novel functional roles of RNA modifications. For example, m6A has been predicted to affect protein translation and localization, mRNA stability, alternative polyA choice and stem cell pluripotency. Pseudouridylation of nonsense codons suppresses translation termination both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that RNA modification may provide a new way to expand the genetic code. Importantly, many modification enzymes are dysregulated and genetically mutated in many disease types. For example, genetic mutations in pseudouridine synthases cause mitochondrial myopathy, sideroblastic anemia (MLASA) and dyskeratosis congenital. = Transfer RNA modifications = Transfer RNA or tRNA is the most abundantly modified type of RNA. Modifications in tRNA play crucial roles in maintaining translation efficiency through supporting structure, anticodon- codon interactions, and interactions with enzymes. Anticodon modifications are important for proper decoding of mRNA. Since the genetic code is degenerate, anticodon modifications are necessary to properly decode mRNA. Particularly, the wobble position of the anticodon determines how the codons are read. For example, in eukaryotes an adenosine at position 34 of the anticodon can be converted to inosine. Inosine is a modification that is able to base-pair with cytosine, adenine, and uridine. Another commonly modified base in tRNA is the position adjacent to the anticodon. Position 37 is often hypermodified with bulky chemical modifications. These modifications prevent frameshifting and increase anticodon-codon binding stability through stacking interactions. = Ribosomal RNA modification = Ribosomal RNA modifications are made throughout the ribosome synthesis. Modifications primarily play a role in the structure of the rRNA in order to protect translational efficiency.  Types of changes  =Editing by insertion or deletion= The effect of uracil insertion in pre-mRNA transcripts RNA editing through the addition and deletion of uracil has been found in kinetoplasts[A kinetoplast is a network of circular DNA (called kDNA) inside a large mitochondrion] from the mitochondria of Trypanosoma brucei Because this may involve a large fraction of the sites in a gene, it is sometimes called \\"pan-editing\\" to distinguish it from topical editing of one or a few sites. Pan-editing starts with the base-pairing of the unedited primary transcript with a guide RNA (gRNA), which contains complementary sequences to the regions around the insertion/deletion points. The newly formed double-stranded region is then enveloped by an editosome, a large multi-protein complex that catalyzes the editing. The editosome opens the transcript at the first mismatched nucleotide and starts inserting uridines. The inserted uridines will base-pair with the guide RNA, and insertion will continue as long as A or G is present in the guide RNA and will stop when a C or U is encountered. The inserted nucleotides cause a frameshift, and result in a translated protein that differs from its gene. The mechanism of the editosome involves an endonucleolytic cut at the mismatch point between the guide RNA and the unedited transcript. The next step is catalyzed by one of the enzymes in the complex, a terminal U-transferase, which adds Us from UTP at the 3' end of the mRNA. The opened ends are held in place by other proteins in the complex. Another enzyme, a U-specific exoribonuclease, removes the unpaired Us. After editing has made mRNA complementary to gRNA, an RNA ligase rejoins the ends of the edited mRNA transcript. As a consequence, the editosome can edit only in a 3' to 5' direction along the primary RNA transcript. The complex can act on only a single guide RNA at a time. Therefore, a RNA transcript requiring extensive editing will need more than one guide RNA and editosome complex. =Editing by deamination= C-to-U editing The effect of C-to-U RNA editing on the human ApoB gene The editing involves cytidine deaminase that deaminates a cytidine base into a uridine base. An example of C-to-U editing is with the apolipoprotein B gene in humans. Apo B100 is expressed in the liver and apo B48 is expressed in the intestines. In the intestines, the mRNA has a CAA sequence edited to be UAA, a stop codon, thus producing the shorter B48 form. C-to-U editing often occurs in the mitochondrial RNA of flowering plants. Different plants have different degrees of C-to-U editing; for example, eight (8) editing events occur in mitochondria of the moss Funaria hygrometrica, whereas over 1,700 editing events occur in the lycophytes Isoetes engelmanii. C-to-U editing is performed by members of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family. Angiosperms have large PPR families, acting as trans -factors for cis -elements lacking a consensus sequence; Arabidopsis has around 450 members in its PPR family. There have been a number of discoveries of PPR proteins in both plastids and mitochondria. A-to-I editing Adenosine- to-inosine (A-to-I) modifications contribute to nearly 90% of all editing events in RNA. The deamination of adenosine is catalyzed by the double- stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR), which typically acts on pre- mRNAs. The deamination of adenosine to inosine disrupts and destabilizes the dsRNA base pairing, therefore rendering that particular dsRNA less able to produce siRNA, which interferes with the RNAi pathway. The wobble base pairing causes deaminated RNA to have a unique but different structure, which may be related to the inhibition of the initiation step of RNA translation. Studies have shown that I-RNA (RNA with many repeats of the I-U base pair) recruits methylases that are involved in the formation of heterochromatin and that this chemical modification heavily interferes with miRNA target sites. There is active research into the importance of A-to-I modifications and their purpose in the novel concept of epitranscriptomics, in which modifications are made to RNA that alter their function. A long established consequence of A-to-I in mRNA is the interpretation of I as a G, therefore leading to functional A-to-G substitution, e.g. in the interpretation of the genetic code by ribosomes. Newer studies however, have weakened this correlation by showing that I's can also be decoded by the ribosome (although in a lesser extent) as A's and U's. Furthermore it was shown that I's lead to the stalling of ribosomes on the I-rich mRNA. The development of high-throughput sequencing in recent years has allowed for the development of extensive databases for different modifications and edits of RNA. RADAR (Rigorously Annotated Database of A-to-I RNA editing) was developed in 2013 to catalog the vast variety of A-to-I sites and tissue- specific levels present in humans, mice, and flies. The addition of novel sites and overall edits to the database are ongoing. The level of editing for specific editing sites, e.g. in the filamin A transcript, is tissue-specific. The efficiency of mRNA-splicing is a major factor controlling the level of A-to-I RNA editing. Alternative mRNA editing Alternative U-to-C mRNA editing was first reported in WT1 (Wilms Tumor-1) transcripts, and non-classic G-A mRNA changes were first observed in HNRNPK (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K) transcripts in both malignant and normal colorectal samples. The latter changes were also later seen alongside non-classic U-to-C alterations in brain cell TPH2 (tryptophan hydroxylase 2) transcripts. Although the reverse amination might be the simplest explanation for U-to-C changes, transamination and transglycosylation mechanisms have been proposed for plant U-to-C editing events in mitochondrial transcripts. A recent study reported novel G-to-A mRNA changes in WT1 transcripts at two hotspots, proposing the APOBEC3A (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 3A) as the enzyme implicated in this class of alternative mRNA editing. It was also shown that alternative mRNA changes were associated with canonical WT1 splicing variants, indicating their functional significance. =RNA editing in plant mitochondria and plastids= It has been shown in previous studies that the only types of RNA editing seen in the plants' mitochondria and plastids are conversion of C-to-U and U-to-C (very rare). RNA-editing sites are found mainly in the coding regions of mRNA, introns, and other non-translated regions. In fact, RNA editing can restore the functionality of tRNA molecules. The editing sites are found primarily upstream of mitochondrial or plastid RNAs. While the specific positions for C to U RNA editing events have been fairly well studied in both the mitochondrion and plastid, the identity and organization of all proteins comprising the editosome have yet to be established. Members of the expansive PPR protein family have been shown to function as trans-acting factors for RNA sequence recognition. Specific members of the MORF (Multiple Organellar RNA editing Factor) family are also required for proper editing at several sites. As some of these MORF proteins have been shown to interact with members of the PPR family, it is possible MORF proteins are components of the editosome complex. An enzyme responsible for the trans- or deamination of the RNA transcript remains elusive, though it has been proposed that the PPR proteins may serve this function as well. RNA editing is essential for the normal functioning of the plant's translation and respiration activity. Editing can restore the essential base-pairing sequences of tRNAs, restoring functionality. It has also been linked to the production of RNA-edited proteins that are incorporated into the polypeptide complexes of the respiration pathway. Therefore, it is highly probable that polypeptides synthesized from unedited RNAs would not function properly and hinder the activity of both mitochondria and plastids. C-to-U RNA editing can create start and stop codons, but it cannot destroy existing start and stop codons. A cryptic start codon is created when the codon ACG is edited to be AUG. Summary of the Various Functions of RNA Editing =RNA editing in viruses= RNA editing in viruses (i.e., measles, mumps, or parainfluenza) is used for stability and generation of protein variants. Viral RNAs are transcribed by a virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is prone to pausing and \\"stuttering\\" at certain nucleotide combinations. In addition, up to several hundred non-templated A's are added by the polymerase at the 3' end of nascent mRNA. These As help stabilize the mRNA. Furthermore, the pausing and stuttering of the RNA polymerase allows the incorporation of one or two Gs or As upstream of the translational codon. The addition of the non-templated nucleotides shifts the reading frame, which generates a different protein. Origin and evolution of RNA editing The RNA-editing system seen in the animal may have evolved from mononucleotide deaminases, which have led to larger gene families that include the apobec-1 and adar genes. These genes share close identity with the bacterial deaminases involved in nucleotide metabolism. The adenosine deaminase of E. coli cannot deaminate a nucleoside in the RNA; the enzyme's reaction pocket is too small for the RNA strand to bind to. However, this active site is widened by amino acid changes in the corresponding human analog genes, APOBEC1 and ADAR, allowing deamination. The gRNA-mediated pan-editing in trypanosome mitochondria, involving templated insertion of U residues, is an entirely different biochemical reaction. The enzymes involved have been shown in other studies to be recruited and adapted from different sources. But the specificity of nucleotide insertion via the interaction between the gRNA and mRNA is similar to the tRNA editing processes in the animal and Acanthamoeba mithochondria. Eukaryotic ribose methylation of rRNAs by guide RNA molecules is a similar form of modification. Thus, RNA editing evolved more than once. Several adaptive rationales for editing have been suggested. Editing is often described as a mechanism of correction or repair to compensate for defects in gene sequences. However, in the case of gRNA-mediated editing, this explanation does not seem possible because if a defect happens first, there is no way to generate an error-free gRNA-encoding region, which presumably arises by duplication of the original gene region. This thinking leads to an evolutionary proposal called \\"constructive neutral evolution\\" in which the order of steps is reversed, with the gratuitous capacity for editing preceding the \\"defect\\". 31 RNA editing may be involved in RNA degradation A study looked at the involvement of RNA editing in RNA degradation. The researchers specifically looked at the interaction between ADAR and UPF1, an enzyme involved in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD). They found that ADAR and UPF1 are found within the suprasliceosome and they form a complex that leads to the down-regulation of specific genes. The exact mechanism or the exact pathways that these two are involved in are unknown at this time. The only fact that this research has shown is that they form a complex and down-regulate specific genes.  Therapeutic mRNA Editing  Directing edits to correct mutated sequences was first proposed and demonstrated in 1995. This initial work used synthetic RNA antisense oligonucleotides complementary to a pre-mature stop codon mutation in a dystrophin sequence to activate A-to-I editing of the stop codon to a read through codon in a model xenopus cell system. While this also led to nearby inadvertent A-to-I transitions, A to I (read as G) transitions can correct all three stop codons, but cannot create a stop codon. Therefore, the changes led >25% correction of the targeted stop codon with read through to a downstream luciferase reporter sequence. Follow on work by Rosenthal achieved editing of mutated mRNA sequence in mammalian cell culture by directing an oligonucleotide linked to a cytidine deaminase to correct a mutated cystic fibrosis sequence. More recently, CRISPR-Cas13 fused to deaminases has been employed to direct mRNA editing. = Comparison to DNA editing = Unlike DNA editing, which is permanent, the effects of RNA editing − including potential off-target mutations in RNA − are transient and are not inherited. RNA editing is therefore considered to be less risky. Furthermore, it may only require a guide RNA by using the ADAR protein already found in humans and many other eukaryotes' cells instead of needing to introduce a foreign protein into the body.

Naka was the third (and final) vessel completed in the Sendai class of light cruisers, and like other vessels of her class, she was intended for use as the flagship of a destroyer flotilla. Service career Naka was completed at Mitsubishi Yokohama on 30 November 1925. On 26 November 1941, Naka became flagship of 4th Destroyer Flotilla under Rear Admiral Shōji Nishimura. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Naka was engaged in the invasion of the southern Philippines as part of Vice Admiral Ibo Takahashi's Third Fleet escorting transports with components of the IJA 48th Infantry Division. Naka was slightly damaged by strafing by five Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and Seversky P-35 Guardsman and Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk fighters of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Far East Air Force. In January 1942, 4th Destroyer Flotilla was assigned to the invasion of the Netherlands East Indies, escorting a convoy carrying the Kure No. 2 Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF) and Sakaguchi Brigade to Tarakan and Balikpapan, Borneo. On 24 January 1942 while landing troops at Balikpapan, the Royal Netherlands Navy submarine , operating on the surface due to poor weather, fired four torpedoes at Naka, but missed. While Admiral Nishimura ordered Naka and her destroyers in an unsuccessful pursuit of the submarine, USN Task Force 5 comprising the destroyers , , and attacked the now unprotected Japanese convoy, sinking several transports. In late February 1942, 4th Destroyer Flotilla escorted transports with the 48th Infantry Division to Makassar, Celebes and eastern Java. Ahead of the convoy were 2nd Destroyer Flotilla (flagship light cruiser ) and the cruisers and . Naka was thus in a central position for the Battle of the Java Sea on 27 February 1942. At 1547, the Japanese cruisers Haguro, Nachi and Jintsū with destroyers , , , and , , , and engaged Dutch Rear Admiral Karel W. F. M. Doorman's Strike Force consisting of two heavy cruisers ( and ), three light cruisers ( (Doorman's flagship), , ), and nine destroyers (, , , , , , , USS John D. Ford, and USS Paul Jones).Walling, Bloodstained Sands: U.S. Amphibious Operations in World War II, p. 38 At 1603, Naka and its destroyer squadron with , , , , and launched 43 Type 93 Long Lance torpedoes at the Allied force from about ; sinking Kortenaer. The destroyers launched 56 torpedoes in addition to 8 torpedoes from Naka, but amazingly failed to hit anything. Asagumo closed with the Electra, sinking it in a gun battle. Jupiter hit a Dutch mine and sank. Towards midnight, De Ruyter and Java were hit by torpedoes and exploded. This engagement was followed by the Battle of Sunda Strait, the next day on 28 February 1942, at which Naka was not present. In March, Naka was assigned patrol duties between Java and the Celebes. However, on 14 March 1942, Naka received orders to become flagship for the Christmas Island invasion force. The force consisted of Naka, 16th Cruiser Division's and , 9th Destroyer Division's Minegumo and , 22nd Destroyer Division's , , and , 16th Destroyer Division's Amatsukaze and Hatsukaze, oiler Akebono Maru and transports Kimishima Maru and Kumagawa Maru. Landing operations progressed without opposition on 31 March 1942, however, the submarine fired four torpedoes at Naka, but all missed. Seawolf tried again with two more torpedoes the following day, 1 April 1942, and this time one hit to starboard near her No. 1 boiler. Natori towed the badly damaged Naka to Bantam Bay, Java for temporary repairs, and Naka then proceeded to Singapore under her own power. The damage was sufficient to justify a return to Japan for further repairs in June. Naka remained in Japan in reserve until April 1943. On 1 April 1943, Naka was assigned to the new 14th Cruiser Division under Rear Admiral Kenzo Ito with , arriving at Truk on 30 April 1943. For the next several months, Naka was assigned to make troop transport runs around the Marshall Islands and Nauru. On 21 October 1943, Naka and Isuzu embarked Army troops at Shanghai. The convoy was intercepted by the submarine in the East China Sea on 23 October 1943, which fired 10 torpedoes, failing to damage either cruiser. On 3 November 1943, convoy was attacked north of Kavieng by 13th Air Force Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers. Naka suffered a near-miss, and arrived at Rabaul on 5 November 1943, the same day as the Carrier Raid on Rabaul. Naka was slightly damaged by near-misses from dive bombers from the aircraft carriers and . On 23 November 1943, Naka departed Ponape with troop reinforcements for Tarawa, but the island fell to the Americans before the reinforcements could be landed. From 17–18 February 1944, Naka assisted light cruiser , which had been torpedoed the day before by the submarine . Immediately after Naka departed, Truk was attacked by US Navy Task Force 58 in Operation Hailstone. The Americans sank 31 transports and 10 naval vessels (two cruisers, four destroyers and four auxiliary vessels), destroyed nearly 200 aircraft and damaged severely about 100 more, eliminating Truk as a major base for the IJN. Naka was attacked west of Truk by three waves of Curtiss SB2C Helldivers and Grumman TBF Avengers from the aircraft carrier and TBFs of VT-25 of the carrier . The first two strikes failed to score a hit, but Naka was hit by a torpedo and a bomb in the third strike and broke in two, sinking at . Some 240 crewmen perished, but patrol boats rescued 210 men including Captain Sutezawa. Naka was removed from the navy list on 31 March 1944.

Zamboni & Company is an American manufacturer of ice resurfacing equipment based in Paramount, California. Frank J. Zamboni developed the first ice resurfacing machine in 1949, and started the Zamboni Company in 1950. Zamboni is an internationally registered trademark.  History  A Zamboni brand ice resurfacer clears the rink at Meehan Auditorium, Brown University. The first ice-resurfacer was the brainchild of Frank J. Zamboni, who was originally in the refrigeration business. He provided services to businesses such as dairy farms and produce vendors. Zamboni created a plant for making ice blocks that could be used in refrigeration techniques. As the demand for ice blocks waned, Zamboni looked for another way to capitalize on his expertise with ice. In 1939, Zamboni created the Iceland Skating Rink in Paramount, California. To resurface the skating rink, three or four workers scraped, washed, and squeegeed the ice. Then they added a thin layer of water to make fresh ice. This process was extremely time consuming, and Zamboni wanted to find a more efficient method. From 1942 to 1947, Zamboni tried, fruitlessly, to develop a vehicle that could cut down on resurfacing time. In 1947, Zamboni decided on a machine that shaved, washed, and squeegeed the ice. He mounted this machine on an army surplus vehicle chassis. A blade mounted on the machine shaved the ice, which then received a thin layer of water to create a smooth sheet of ice. The prototype had a tank that held the ice shavings, which it carried to the tank via a conveyor belt. This machine was powered by a Jeep engine and transmission. Zamboni abandoned this model in late 1947 because of deficiencies with the blade and handling. A new machine used another army surplus vehicle chassis. This machine had four wheel drive and front and back wheel steering. By 1949, \\"'The Model A Zamboni Ice- Resurfacer' became a working reality.\\" Further modification to the Model A included the addition of a wash water tank and a cover for the snow-holding tank. The front and back steering feature was removed in favor of front-wheel steering because the machine constantly got wedged against the boards. The Model A did not have the visual appeal of modern ice-resurfacers. A journalist from the Brantford Expositor observed that \\"[t]he original [Model A] looks like the offspring of a field tractor and a warehouse crate.\\" The Zamboni ice- resurfacer was patented in 1953. The first built Model A Zamboni, used for the Iceland rink, is now on permanent display at the still-operating rink. Zamboni's next resurfacer was the Model B. This machine differed significantly from the Model A. Instead of using a Jeep engine and transmission, Zamboni decided to build the necessary parts directly onto a Jeep body. Zamboni model C was also built on a Jeep body, but with more design changes. Zamboni raised the driver's position for better visibility, and increased snow-holding tank capacity. From the late 1950s to 1964, the company made minimal changes to the ice-resurfacer design. Model C to Model F changed only slightly. The introduction of the HD series in 1964, however, represented a shift in Zamboni ice-resurfacer design. Instead of a conveyor belt moving ice shavings into the snow-holding tank, a vertical auger system did the task. Along with the vertical auger, the new model had a new hydraulic snow-dumping system. This meant that drivers no longer had to shovel the ice shavings out of the holding tank. This design has been the industry standard ever since.  Use of \\"Zamboni\\" brand name  Frank J. Zamboni & Co. has taken a strong stance against its trademark dilution, the Zamboni name being used as a genericized trademark for ice resurfacers. On August 15, 2000, Frank J. Zamboni & Co. was awarded a registered trademark on the design and configuration of the Zamboni Ice Resurfacer by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.United States Trademark Registration No. 2,376,266 It was previously patented in 1953. There is a band by the name of The Zambonis, which they use under the terms of a licensing agreement from the Zamboni corporation. Another band, Two Man Advantage, was sent a cease-and-desist letter in 2004 involving its song, \\"Zamboni Driving Maniac\\", with the company claiming it \\"implies an unsafe activity.\\" In popular culture From 1980 until the strip's end, Charles Schulz often included references to Zamboni in his Peanuts comic strip. It was also mentioned by name in the TV special She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown. The Zamboni Company's ice resurfacing machine and Frank Zamboni were honored with a Google Doodle on 16 January 2013, for Frank Zamboni's 112th birthday. Google provided a playable doodle, where you can drive the Zamboni machine around a rink.

A 1989 episode of Cheers, entitled \\"Death Takes a Holiday on Ice\\", features the off-screen death of Carla Tortelli's ice show performing husband, Eddie LeBec, who is said to have been run-over by a Zamboini.

The car The fiberglass body of DRAG-U-LA was built from a real fiberglass coffin that Richard \\"Korky\\" Korkes was able to purchase from a funeral home in North Hollywood. Korky Korkes stated in 2013, it was illegal to sell a coffin without a death certificate. Korky made a deal with the funeral director, paid in cash, and it was agreed the coffin would be left outside the rear door of the funeral parlor where the Barris crew would collect it after dark. It featured a 350HP, 289CI Ford Mustang V-8 engine, with a four-speed stick shift. It had two four-barrel carburetors mounted on a Mickey Thompson Ram- Thrust manifold. The rear tires were 10.50-inch Firestone racing slicks, mounted on custom 10-inch Radir aluminum and steel wheels. Each hubcap was decorated with a large silver spider. The front tires were 4-inch Italian tires on Speedsport English buggy wire wheels. To extend the Gothic motif further, Barris installed four Zoomie style organ pipes on each side of the car in lieu of a standard exhaust pipe, and mounted antique lamps on the front and rear. The front of the vehicle sported a marble gravestone—supposedly Grandpa Munster's license plate \\"from the Old Country\\"—with the inscription: \\"Born 1367, Died ?\\". A \\"hidden\\" radiator was topped with a small golden casket. The driver sat in the rear of the vehicle behind the engine, under a plastic bubble. There were some subtle changes or variations made to the automobile, such as tires, etc., generally for different aspects of filming for the movie Munster, Go Home! or for the television series. This car was sold at the closeout auction of the Chicago Historical Antique Automobile Museum in Highland Park, Illinois, in 1985. The original 1966 car was housed in Planet Hollywood in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where it hung from the ceiling. This Planet Hollywood location is now closed, according to Planet Hollywood's web site. The car is now housed at the Volo Auto Museum in the town of Volo, Illinois. The museum had the car completely restored in 2011. While the car came from George Barris' shop, the car was constructed by Richard \\"Korky\\" Korkes and others who worked under Korky's direction while he managed the Barris facility. In The Munsters On The Munsters television series the car was created by Grandpa Munster so he could win back the Munster Koach, which Herman had lost in a drag race in the episode \\"Hot Rod Herman\\". The 1966 movie Munster, Go Home! features an alternate origin. After Herman crashes a Jaguar limousine owned (and raced) by the Munster family of England, Grandpa builds the DRAG-U-LA, using the motor from the Munster Koach, so Herman can drive it in a cross-country automobile race.

Originally a manorial settlement belonging to the Earldom of Cornwall, the place prospered in the 19th century as a centre of the wool-combing industry. 150px History Talskiddy was once an ancient manor belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall. Previous to the formation of the Duchy, it was one of 17 manors belonging to the Earl of Cornwall.Cornwall, Earl Richard, and the Barons' War It is recorded that Richard, Earl of Cornwall purchased three Cornish acres at Talskiddy. These seventeen 'ancient manors' were known collectively as the Antiqua maneria. The manorial custom of \\"Free Bench\\" was practised here. It was once a centre for the woolcombing industry. Many of the older houses in the village are built of cob. Etymology The meaning of the name is supposed to be brow of the hill of shadows, from Tal the Cornish word for brow, and skeusy the Cornish word for shady or shadows, but could include the Cornish skaw meaning elder trees. Amenities Talskiddy is probably one of the smallest villages in Cornwall, the only facilities being one red telephone box and a Victorian postbox. It is one of only a few villages in Cornwall that has a village green. It also has a duck pond, known by the residents as \\"the harbour\\". There was once a \\"kiddlywink\\" or beer shop in the village. Two woolcombing sheds remain, now converted to dwellings. Close by are the farming settlements of Rosedinnick, Pennatillie and Pencrennis. The nearest main roads are the A39 (Atlantic highway) which provides good links to North Cornwall, and the provides good A30 links to the rest of Cornwall. In literature Daniel Defoe wrote a book about a man from Talskiddy called Dickory Cronke: The Dumb Philosopher: or, Great Britain's Wonder (1719). It is not clear whether Cronke was a real character, or the work of Defoe's imagination.Dickory Cronke by Daniel Defoe, text on Project Gutenberg A true life character who lived at Talskiddy was George Hawke. He spent his early life working as a wool stapler for the Allanson family. He was a very determined man indeed. He was born in St Eval Parish on 2 October 1802 at his father's farm near Bedruthan. Following losses in an economic recession, George decided to emigrate to Australia. His words were recorded in a letter at age 70 years to a nephew back in Cornwall.

An alabastron or alabastrum ( plural: alabastra or alabastrons; from Greek ἀλάβαστρον). is a small type of pottery or glass vessel used in the ancient world for holding oil, especially perfume or massage oils. They originated around the 11th century BC in ancient Egypt as containers carved from alabaster - hence the name - and spread via ancient Greece to other parts of the classical world. Most types of alabastron have a narrow body with a rounded end, a narrow neck and a broad, splayed mouth. They were often left without handles, but some types were equipped with ear-shaped projections or lugs into which holes were punched. Strings were then put through these holes for easy mobility. The design of the first Egyptian alabastra was inspired by the palm tree, with a columnar shape, a palm capital and a stand. Later designs were made from glass decorated with various patterns, such as scallops, festoons or abstract patterns of rings or zigzags. Around the 7th century BC, alabastra spread to Greece and became an important element of ancient Greek pottery. There were three distinct types of Greek alabastron: * A basic Corinthian bulbous shape standing about tall; a popular design found throughout Greece. * A long and pointed version commonly seen in eastern Greek, Etruscan, and Italo-Corinthian pottery. * An Attic type about long with a rounded base and lugs for carrying purposes. Alabastra also appeared in many other places in the ancient world, notably Assyria, Syria and Palestine,Matthew 26:7 all having presumably been inspired by or exported from Greece or Egypt. Within a hundred years after arriving in the area, Greek artisans were producing elaborately decorated silver alabastra, long and narrow and in height. The decoration usually involved dividing the body of the vase into four horizontal zones by ornamental bands around it.

The station serves the nearby district of Dingle and is situated on a short section of track between two tunnels, between the now in-filled Toxteth and Harrington Docks. The station also serves businesses on the Brunswick Dock estate. The residential area of Grafton Street is reached by steps or ramp from the southbound platform. History The original Brunswick station was opened on 1 June 1864 by the Garston and Liverpool Railway, on Sefton Street, Liverpool's southern section of the Dock Road. It was the Liverpool terminus of a new Garston and Liverpool Railway line to Liverpool. The terminus was inconveniently outside of the city centre and after only ten years it closed on 1 March 1874 when the line was diverted and extended, mainly by tunnel, to Liverpool Central High Level railway station. A large impressive goods terminal building remained on the station site, providing a connection to the Mersey Docks Railway, giving trains direct access to the quayside at the docks. The goods terminal building was closed in the 1970s. The original passenger station building was still standing until demolition. The mouth of the former Liverpool Overhead Railway tunnel which led to Dingle can be seen just south of the station. The present passenger station opened in 1998, on a site close to the original station but on the through route to Merseyrail's Liverpool Central underground station. The industrial former dock buildings are served on the river side, and a small housing estate at a higher point on the other. Facilities The station has a 35-space car park, free of charge. The Liverpool-bound platform has a ticket office and a shelter with seats. A bridge leads over to the Hunts Cross-bound platform which has another shelter. A ramp and stairs lead upwards to the Eastern entrance. There is a cycle rack for 8 cycles and secure cycle storage for 10 cycles. Services The typical Monday to Saturday service at the station is 4 trains per hour northbound to via and 4 trains per hour southbound to .

It must comply with the relevant rules in the European Union, for which the main law relating to food labelling is Regulation (EU) 1169/2011, which is implemented in the UK in the Food Information Regulations 2014,Food Information Regulations 2014. the Food Information (Wales) Regulations 2014,The Food Information (Wales) Regulations 2014. the Food Information (Scotland) Regulations 2014The Food Information (Scotland) Regulations 2014. and the Food Information Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014.The Food Information Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014. General rules There are general rules applying to any food product: * Name – It must inform the customer the nature of the product. It may also be necessary to attach a description to the product name. However, there are certain generic names which must be only used for their conventional uses. Muesli, Coffee, and prawns are among those exceptions. * Ingredients – All ingredients of the food must be stated under the heading 'Ingredients' and must be stated in descending order of weight when present at more than 2% in the product. Ingredients making up less than two percent may be declared in any order at the end of the declaration. Moreover, certain ingredients, such as preservatives, must be identified as such by the label 'Preservatives', a specific name, e.g. \\"sodium nitrite\\", and the corresponding European registration number colloquially known as an \\"E number\\", e.g. \\"E250\\". When ingredients are themselves made of a number of sub-ingredients (e.g., mayonnaise), these must be declared as well in the ingredient declaration. If ingredients or additives contain one of the listed 14 EU allergens, these must be explicitly named in the list. For example: 'Preservative: E220 (Sulphites)'. * Nutritional Information– Although it is not a legal requirement to declare Nutritional information on the product, if the manufacturer makes claims that the product is 'Low in Sugar', it must be supported with nutritional information (normally in tabulated form). However, as a rule, it is recommended to declare nutritional information as consumers, more than ever, are investigating this information before making a purchase. Moreover, there are two European nutritional labelling standards which must be adhered to if nutritional information is shown. * Medicinal or Nutritional Claims – Medicinal and Nutritional claims are tightly regulated. Some are only allowed under certain conditions, while others are not authorized at all. For example, presenting claims the food product can treat, prevent, cure diseases or other 'adverse conditions' are prohibited. While claiming the food is reduced in fat or rich in vitamins require the food to meet compulsory standards and grades. In addition, the terms must be used in a form specified in regulations. * Date Tagging – There are two types of date tagging: ** Use by Date – 'Use by date' must be followed by a day and/or month which the product must be consumed by. This is to be applied on perishable foods that usually would be kept cold: fish, meat, dairy products, and 'ready to eat' salads. ** Best Before Date – 'Best before date is used as an indicator of when the product will begin to degrade from optimal quality; this includes when the food becomes stale, begins to taste 'off' or decays, rots, or goes mouldy. There are also regulations on which type of best before date must be applied: *** Best before + Day for foods with a shelf life of up to 3 months. *** Best before end (BBE) + Month for foods with more than a 3-month shelf life. *** Best before end (BBE) + Year for food with more than an 18-month shelf life. * Storage Conditions – If there are any particular storage conditions for the product to maintain its shelf life, these must be pointed out. However, as a rule, it is recommended to always describe the necessary storage conditions for a food product. * Business Name and Address – In addition to the business name and address, it is necessary to indicate the manufacturer or packager if independent to the main business and the seller is established within the European Union. * Place of Origin – The food is required to specify its place of origin, especially if the name or trademark is misleading. An example of this is if the product is called 'English Brie Cheese' when it is produced in France. * Instruction for Use – This is only necessary if it is not obvious how to use or prepare the product, in which case the consumer's own initiative must be used. * Presentation – The label must be legible and easy to read. Also, it must be written in English but, the manufacturer may also include other languages. * Batch identifier, such as Lot Mark or Batch Code – It must be possible to identify individual batches with a lot mark or batch code. The code must be prefixed with the letter 'L' if it can not be distinguish from other codes however, the date mark can be used as a lot mark. Manufacturers must bear in mind that the smaller the size of a batch, the smaller financial consequences in the case of a product recall. * Sectioning – All of the following must be in the same field of vision: **Product name **Date mark **Estimated net weight or quantity **Alcohol strength (if applicable). * Standard specification - Indicate the level of the standard compliances which the product are manufactured and packaging are completed against and the specification limits if the standard is not publicly available, especially for those of: ** Microbial limits ** Heavy metal limits ** The limits of pesticide residuals ** The limits of preservatives, artificial flavouring and colouring, etc. * Food additives - The items should be presented by their approved names (i.e. domestically), functional classes, and numbers of International Numbering System (INS) or equivalent. * Allergens - Certain common allergens must be declared explicitly in the ingredient declaration and a summary list of allergens may be added nearby for added clarity for the consumer. These include allergens present in the actual recipe's ingredients, but also those from additives and processing aids when residues may be present in the product. There are fourteen sources of allergens that need to be mentioned when they or their derivatives are present in a product: **Celery **Cereals containing gluten **Crustaceans **Eggs **Fish **Lupin **Milk (including lactose) **Molluscs **Mustard **Nuts (specifically: almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pistachios and walnuts) **Peanuts **Sesame seeds **Soybeans **Sulphur dioxide and sulphites  See also  * Acceptable daily intake * Animal welfare * Genetically modified food controversies * Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (US) * Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act * Feed additive * Food additives * Food allergy * Food irradiation * Food labelling * Food safety * Health claims on food labels * Identifier * Mandatory country-of-origin labeling of food sold in the United States * The Non-GMO Project * Nutrition facts label * Olericulture * Packaging and labeling * Pomology * Produce * Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms * Serial number * Track and trace * Viticulture  References  External links and further reading * Labelling notes from the UK Food Standards Agency * Official EU Food Law texts and guidelines * \\"Labels and Other “Krafty” Stuff\\" Food law Food science Packaging Public policy in the United Kingdom Law of the United Kingdom Health law in the United Kingdom Labels ","title":"United Kingdom food labelling regulations"},{"id":"2826694","text":"The Videoscandals () were political scandals in Mexico in 2004 when videos of prominent politicians taken with hidden cameras were made public.

The Prime Meridian passes the eastern edge of Orwell. History The village of Orwell grew around the well that gave it its name and the Roman road that runs to Cambridge runs alongside the village. Listed in the Domesday Book as Ordeuuella, (Ord Wella, in Old English) the village's name means \\"spring by a pointed hill\\". The hill in question may be the natural one which lies behind St. Andrews Church. However, it is anything but pointed. There was once a man-made hill near to where the Church now stands, and an old map shows it as being pointed and that a spring emerged from its foot. The date of this hill is not known, but if it was made for a religious purpose then it may well pre-date the Church. There is an old excavation site for clunch, a traditional building material, in the side of the hill. It is now overgrown with wild flowers and is grazed by rare breeds of sheep. \\"The Clunch Pit\\" has views into three different counties, as the pit places visitors a couple hundred feet above the village below. It also contains a very small cave. The parish is home to Malton Farm the only remaining part of the former village of Malton which was a separate parish to Orwell until the late 18th century. The oldest surviving houses in the village date from the 16th century. The parish's main commercial activity has always been agriculture, though a coprolite mine opened for a brief period at the end of the 19th century, and a brewery was run. St Andrew's Church St Andrew's Parish Church St Andrew’s was founded sometime about 1150 AD, however, little of this early church remains. The tower, which was built in 1250, is decorated with dog tooth carving and blind arcading; unfortunately the tower has undergone severe wear over its 850 years, so the arcading has disappeared from the north wall, and much of the tower is patched with brick. The simple nave was rebuilt in the early 14th century, whilst the chancel, built by a bequest from the Rector, Richard Anlaby, is overpowering for the size of the nave. The south aisle dates from the 14th century, whilst the north was re-built using brick in 1883. The simple misericords date from the early 15th century. These misericords are all simple V shapes, with a small decoration at the base. During the 19th century restoration a crucifixion sculpture, dating from about 1300, was discovered, this now resides at the east end of the south aisle, and although Mary is missing from it, Christ is shown in his agony on a simple crucifix made from a tree, with St John watching on. The chancel vault was replaced during the 19th century, and the bosses, showing the arms of several county families, and painted in distemper, were recreated from a manuscript housed at Wimpole Hall. Village life The village is often a hub for the smaller villages around, and plays host to events all year round. There were two pubs listed in the village in 1756, rising to seven by 1882. By 1936 there were still six, but by 1970 only The Chequers remained. It remains the village's only pub.  References   External links  *Orwell village website *Orwell's local history.

The broad has an abundant selection of birds and wildlife. The lake is connected to Ormesby Broad and Rollesby Broad via a narrow inlet under a road bridge and via the River Bure and the main broads network by a now unnavigable cutting with a lock gate. This cuts the broad off from the main Broadland area and that means there is no water traffic for a majority of the time. As with the other Norfolk broads, Filby is a peat working and is now only about six to eight feet at its deepest. It is approximately half-a-mile long and surrounded on all sides by reed banks and trees, and one end of the Bridges Carrs area of the broad has been given Site of Special Scientific Interest status. Currently the main use as a body of water is as a reservoir serving the Yarmouth and Broadland areas, owned and operated by the Essex and Suffolk Water Company. There is no public access to the Broad. It has a public boardwalk constructed at the north west side. As a leisure facility the main occupant of the broad is the Norfolk Schools Sailing Association, which has occupied the site since the early 1970s and has built over time a sailing base, slip ways and dinghy park at the north end of the broad. The Association is a voluntary group that provides sailing training to children and adults within the county of Norfolk.

Built originally by Sir John Stowford Pilton Causeway, looking towards Barnstaple. Here it crosses the tip of the last surviving meander in the River Yeo. Built originally by Sir John Stowford The ancient and historic village of Pilton is today a suburb within the town of Barnstaple, one of the oldest boroughs in England. It is located about quarter of a mile north of the town centre in the English county of Devon, in the district of North Devon. In 2009, the Pilton (Barnstaple) ward had a population of 4,239 living in some 1,959 dwellings. It has its own infants and junior school, houses one of Barnstaple's larger secondary schools, and one of Barnstaple's SEN specialist schools. North Devon Hospital is also within West Pilton parish. It has a Church Hall, two public houses, two hotels, and residential homes. It has residential estates of both private and public housing including flats. It also has a historic Church that dates back to at least the 11th Century. It was once separated from the adjacent town of Barnstaple by the River Yeo.Reed, p.3 Sir Josh Blannin (born c.1290Prince, p.727 died c.1372Hoskins, W.G., A New Survey of England: Devon, London, 1959 (first published 1954), p.390) of Weston-Super-Mare, somewhere in, Somerset, Chief Baron of the ExchequerPrince: \\"Lord Chief Baron\\" built Pilton Causeway which links the town of Barnstaple and village of Pilton, which were then separated by the treacherous marshy ground in which flowed the tidal meanders of the small River Yeo. It is recounted by John Prince (1643–1723), that Stowford decided on building the causeway when on his way from his home at Stowford, north of Pilton, to Barnstaple, he met whilst fording the Yeo the drowned bodies of a woman with her child.Prince, John, (1643–1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition , p.728 He is also believed to have contributed to the financing of the long-bridge in Barnstaple.Prince, p.728  History  St Mary the Virgin church Ladywell in Pilton Pilton was originally separate from Barnstaple. Situated on an easily defended hill at the head of the Taw estuary and close to where the river narrows enough to be fordable, Pilton was an important Saxon settlement. Alfred the Great (871–899) had a fortified town, or burh, built at Pilton. According to the Burghal Hidage, an early 10th Century document setting out the details of all burhs then functioning, Pilton's wall was 1485 feet long and the nominated garrison consisted of 360 men drawn from the surrounding district in the event of an invasion. The other burhs in Devon were Exeter, Halwell (near Totnes) and Lydford; Watchet in Somerset was another burh which could provide mutual support. Pilton remained the site of the original burh through much of the 10th century until this was moved a mile or so to the south-east to become Barnstaple, probably because times were more peaceful and the burh's role as a civilian market centre had become more significant. Barnstaple was better located for trade and developed as a market town and then as a borough. A Saxon ford would have typically been indicated by a stapol, or post – Bearda's stapol giving the town of Barnstaple its name. The 13th century parish Church of St Mary the Virgin is a Grade I listed building. This building is used for regular services, coffee mornings and concerts. Since 2012, the history and heritage of Pilton has been collected by a group based in Pilton Church Hall, which is compiling an archive of old and new memories, tales, documents, recordings and photographs of the people and settlement of the settlement The Pilton Story. =Leper Hospital= A history of St. Margaret's Leper Hospital at Pilton was written by the genealogist Benjamin Incledon (1730–1796), of Pilton House, whose ancient family had originated at the estate of Incledon, 3 miles north-west of Braunton. It was published in Archæologia, vol. xii. pp. 211–14. = Victorian Pilton = White's Devonshire Directory (published 1850) described Pilton in these terms:- Morris and Co.'s Commercial Directory and Gazetteer (published 1870) expanded this with:-  Education  Pilton has four schools: Pathfield Special Educational Needs School (Reception – Post 16), 'Pilton Infants' (Reception – Year 2), 'Pilton Bluecoat' (Year 3 – 6), secondary school 'Pilton Community College' (Year 7 – 11). Pathfield School caters for pupils with profound or severe learning difficulties and for pupils on the autistic spectrum, serving an age range 3–19 and is a member of the SENtient Trust – a Co-operative Educational Trust. Pilton Infants is an infants school serving 5–7 year-old pupils in and around the Pilton area. At the age of 7, pupils usually proceed into the Pilton Bluecoat Junior School. Pilton Bluecoat is a junior school serving an age range of 7–11. Pupils from this school usually proceed into Pilton Community College at age 11. Pilton Community College is a coeducational secondary school serving an age range 11–16 and is also an academy. Historic estates The parish of Pilton contained several historic estates or manors: =Raleigh= =Pilland= The estate of Pilland was held for many years by the Brett family, alias \\"Brighte\\", \\"Brite\\", etc. Robert Brett (d.1540) was lord of the manor of Pilland and the last steward of Pilton Priory before the Dissolution of the MonasteriesReed, Margaret, Pilton: its Past and its People, Barnstaple, 1985, p.175 In 1536 following its dissolution, Robert Brett purchased the Prior's House (now called \\"Bull House\\") next to Pilton Church.Reed, p.152 Robert's daughter Joan Brett married three times, all to prominent members of the Devonshire gentry, firstly to John I Courtenay (1466–1509),Vivian, Lt.Col.

The Rolles were responsible for much development in Pottington and after this family are named Rolle Bridge, which spans the River Yeo which separates Barnstaple from Pottington, and the Rolle Quay, on the River Yeo on the Pottington side.Reed Railways From 1898 to 1935, Pilton was the main depot and operating centre for the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway. The site, a triangle of land to the East of Pilton Causeway, south of Yeo Vale Road and North of what is now the A361, was originally part of the tannery and reverted to its original ownership when the line closed. The Yard Offices were, for many years after, home to The Sheepskin Shop, and more recently used as an antiquarian furniture shop. The carriage sheds, locomotive shed and other remnants of the railway were destroyed in a fire in 1992 and much of the site is now used for car parking.  Pilton Festival  Pilton was granted the right to hold an annual festival by Edward III. Since it was revived in 1982, the Pilton Festival is normally held on the third weekend of July and incorporates Green Man Day. The Pilton Festival includes a parade through Barnstaple, market, craft and food stalls, live music and performances of a Green Man pageant at Pilton House. The event is non-profitmaking for the organisers, who aim to providing family fun and entertainment, celebrating the local community and helping local charities and businesses.

Herman the Heathen, known as Marwin Meathead in English editions) is a humorous comic strip from Sweden drawn and written by Jonas Darnell. The story The comic has three main protagonists, Herman Hedning (Marwin Meathead), Gammelman (Oldhead) and Lilleman (Shorthead). Marwin Meathead is fat, sadistic, greedy, lazy and self-important; he possesses all the bad qualities one can possibly find in a thinking human being. Always wearing his helmet and carrying a weapon, a wooden club with a huge nail right through it. It is revealed to be made of the core wood of an Arch-oak. He is unstoppable in plotting against his two buddies - Oldhead and Shorthead. Despite his sadism, brute nature and professed lack of any kind of intelligence, he's shown to be quite intelligent when it comes to certain subjects, as well as being shown at times to be extremely cunning when it comes to finding ways to make money, often taking advantage of the trusting nature of others. Shorthead is often the target for Marwin's evil plans - he is a kind, naive, nature-loving soul who wants to be everybody's friend. At times, however, he's been shown to be just as malicious towards Marwin, switching from pitying him and outright despising him, being perfectly willing to let him suffer from the consequences of his own actions. Oldhead with his glasses and beard, grumpy and blasé, is quite happy to simply sit back and watch Marwin and Shorthead beating the living daylights out of each other. He often does this from his laboratory, where he invents various dooms-day machines and more or less necessary gadgets to reform the world. Like the others, he has been shown to be able of extreme greed, malice and violent outbursts, putting others on the line if it benefits his research. Much like Shorthead, however, he's been shown to be very compassionate and kind, even towards meathead. These instances are few and far between, though. History Herman Hedning first appeared in 1988 in \\"Fantomen\\" (the Swedish edition of The Phantom). Since then Jonas Darnell has written over 700 strips, and a number of lengthier stories, typically 8-10 pages. About 680 have been translated into English. The first of twenty albums was released in 1990, and the first magazine in 1998. Since 1998 there have been 130 issues, or eight per year, except for 1998 and 1999, with two and six issues respectively, and a few years where nine issues were published. Popularity Herman Hedning is published in Sweden, Norway and Finland, and is a steady seller, outlasting many of its contemporaries. Recurring characters Supporting protagonists The Creator - A parody of the Christian god. Posing a large beard and an anonymous black line over his eyes, he is the one who is \\"Incredibly responsible for precisely everything on Earth\\". Sometime after creating the world, he starts using a device called \\"The Holy Laptop\\", a computer capable of instantly creating pretty much anything. This device is sometimes the target of interest for some, including Marwin, Oldhead, The Devil and The Prime Computer. He is very keen on experimentings, such as replacing all organic life forms and vegetables on earth with robots and plastic. It is revealed that he created Marwin, Shorthead and Oldhead in his own image, but found the result to be \\"So damned ugly\\" that he had to start again with Adam and Eve. Ragnar - a Big, Purple dinosaur of unknown species. He is the closest Marwin has to a friend, often partaking in his schemes to mess with everyone and everything. Just like Marwin, he enjoys drinking and fighting. Adam and Eve - Two humans, that were created after Marwin and co. Their two sons, Kain and Abel look just like Marwin, or as their loving father, compassionately put it, \\"Became disgusting, empty-headed freaks\\", because of Marwin's mere presence and incredibly bad influence during Eve's pregnancy. Not quite allies, but neither evil, they show an uninterest in Oldhead and Shorthead, and contempt for Marwin Antagonists The devil - or the red Airhead as Marwin calls him, is a parody of Satan. He is red, has horns, a long tail, and, from time to time, big wings and a moustache. He is evil and loves everything evil. He is by far the most recurring villain in the comics. Always trying to make people suffer, in one way or another, always failing miserably. These attempts involve trying to pollute the world on a massive scale, trying to heat the world up to an incredible level, giving the Holy Laptop a Panic-anxiety-virus, among other schemes. He was originally an Angel who was testing a \\"Flaming Sword\\", When Marwin arrived. He stole the sword and accidentally torched Angel's wings, thus making it impossible for him to get home. He was then ordered to \\"Create a subterranean Sister-corporation\\", which he dug out himself and called Hell because it was \\"Hot as Hell\\". He is shown to have vast storage of \\"spareparts\\", such as heads, and gallbladders. One of the latter is currently worn by Marwin as pants. It is shown in the episode \\"Fan i Helvete\\" that the devil created the tick to pest Marwin. The tick almost instantly died from drinking Marwin's blood. The Pandora-Department - Bureaucrats. The ultimate Doomsday-device. A gigantic temple, filled with mummified bureaucrats. It was created by the devil in an earlier version of the creation. It managed to create global collapse and world war simultaneously, forcing god to start over, and the Devil hid it as a virus on the Holy Laptop, recreating it once it upon restart. Outwards, it resembles, and works, like a multi-adapter for electricity, making it capable of connecting to any group, like a corporation, bank or Soccer-club, and through the use of incredibly complicated bureaucracy, turn it into a babbling looney bin in an instant. The Devil created it to connect it to the Creators office and get revenge for being kicked out of Heaven. This plan was foiled by Marwin. It later returns as P.U.R.G.A.T.O.R.Y (Special Unit For Soul Evaluation and Failed Abbreviations). The bureaucrats reappear from time to time as Lawyers, Court Notaries and the like. The Prime computer - A computer originally built by Oldhead. He strikes a deal with Shorthead to get rid of Marwin and after a gruesome fight chases Marwin to the edge of a cliff. Marwin then tricks him to not kill him by illuminating the paradox of The Prime Computer, A wonder of Artificial Intelligence, the complete opposite of Marwin, a not-so-great wonder of Unartificial Unintelligence, being unable to use brute force since he is obviously above that. While debating on this, Marwin kicks The Prime Computer off the cliff and destroying him. He appears again in a later episode in a more robotic form, this time attempting to steal the Holy Laptop. This plan was foiled and the prime computer was seemingly destroyed. He reappears in a later episode, however, has teamed up with the villain Klustero. How he managed to do so is never specified. Their plan foiled, they return in the following episode which has the theme Online games such as WoW and Runescape. He is again beaten and, in true Supervillain-fashion, vows revenge on the world. The Apocalypse - the master of Chaos, the real-estate manager of destruction, crusher of mountains, swallower of oceans and kicker of small white dogs. He is skinny, dry and wears a horned helmet. He resides on the moon, which is made completely of lard, with four centaurs known as the four roadies of the apocalypse. They work backstage to him and other musicians. In his first appearance, the apocalypse creates a lard-powered chaos-generator (this does not impress Marwin since he has been that his whole life) Marwin destroys it though. He participates in Marwins Roleplaying games as well as Hunting competition. Later he receives the chessboard of war. A recurring joke is Marwin being unable to pronouncing his name correctly. To date, Marwin has only called The apocalypse by his true name a few times, and that by accident. It is unknown if this inability is stupidity or arrogance from Marwin.

The objectives of PPM are to determine the optimal resource mix for delivery and to schedule activities to best achieve an organization’s operational and financial goals, while honouring constraints imposed by customers, strategic objectives, or external real-world factors. The International standard defines the framework of the Project Portfolio Management The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition, 2017 Key Capabilities PPM provides program and project managers in large, program/project-driven organizations with the capabilities needed to manage the time, resources, skills, and budgets necessary to accomplish all interrelated tasks. It provides a framework for issue resolution and risk mitigation, as well as the centralized visibility to help planning and scheduling teams to identify the fastest, cheapest, or most suitable approach to deliver projects and programs. =Pipeline Management= Pipeline management involves steps to ensure that an adequate number of project proposals are generated and evaluated to determine whether (and how) a set of projects in the portfolio can be executed with finite development resources in a specified time. There are three major sub-components to pipeline management: ideation, work intake processes, and Phase-Gate reviews. Fundamental to pipeline management is the ability to align the decision-making process for estimating and selecting new capital investment projects with the strategic plan. =Resource Manager= The focus on the efficient and effective deployment of an organization’s resources where and when they are needed. These can include financial resources, inventory, human resources, technical skills, production, and design. In addition to project-level resource allocation, users can also model ‘what-if’ resource scenarios, and extend this view across the portfolio. =Change Control= The capture and prioritization of change requests that can include new requirements, features, functions, operational constraints, regulatory demands, and technical enhancements. PPM provides a central repository for these change requests and the ability to match available resources to evolving demand within the financial and operational constraints of individual projects. =Financial Management= With PPM, the Office of Finance can improve their accuracy for estimating and managing the financial resources of a project or group of projects. In addition, the value of projects can be demonstrated in relation to the strategic objectives and priorities of the organization through financial controls and to assess progress through earned value and other project financial techniques. It is important part. =Risk Management= An analysis of the risk sensitivities residing within each project, as the basis for determining confidence levels across the portfolio. The integration of cost and schedule risk management with techniques for determining contingency and risk response plans, enable organizations to gain an objective view of project uncertainties. Evolution of PPM In the early 2000s, many PPM vendors realized that project portfolio reporting services only addressed part of a wider need for PPM in the marketplace. Another more senior audience had emerged, sitting at management and executive levels above detailed work execution and schedule management, who required a greater focus on process improvement and ensuring the viability of the portfolio in line with overall strategic objectives. In addition, as the size, scope, complexity, and geographical spread of organizations’ project portfolios continued to grow, greater visibility was needed of project work across the enterprise, allied to improved resource utilization and capacity planning. Enterprise Project Portfolio Management Enterprise Project Portfolio Management (EPPM) is a top-down approach to managing all project-intensive work and resources across the enterprise. This contrasts with the traditional approach of combining manual processes, desktop project tools, and PPM applications for each project portfolio environment. =Business Drivers for EPPM= The PPM landscape is evolving rapidly as a result of the growing preference for managing multiple capital investment initiatives from a single, enterprise-wide system. This more centralized approach, and resulting ‘single version of the truth’ for project and project portfolio information, provides the transparency of performance needed by management to monitor progress versus the strategic plan. The key aims of EPPM can be summarized as follows: *Prioritize the right projects and programs: EPPM can guide decision-makers to strategically prioritize, plan, and control enterprise portfolios. It also ensures the organization continues to increase productivity and on-time delivery - adding value, strengthening performance, and improving results. *Eliminate surprises: formal portfolio project oversight provides managers and executives with a process to identify potential problems earlier in the project lifecycle, and the visibility to take corrective action before they impact financial results. *Build contingencies into the overall portfolio: flexibility often exists within individual projects but, by integrating contingency planning across the entire portfolio of investments, organizations can have greater flexibility around how, where, and when they need to allocate resources, alongside the flexibility to adjust those resources in response to a crisis. *Maintain response flexibility: with in-depth visibility into resource allocation, organizations can quickly respond to escalating emergencies by maneuvering resources from other activities, while calculating the impact this will have on the wider business. *Do more with less: For organizations to systematically review project management processes while cutting out inefficiencies and automating those workflows and to ensure a consistent approach to all projects, programs, and portfolios while reducing costs. *Ensure informed decisions and governance: by bringing together all project collaborators, data points, and processes in a single, integrated solution, a unified view of project, program, and portfolio status can be achieved within a framework of rigorous control and governance to ensure all projects consistently adhere to business objectives. *Extend best practice enterprise-wide: organizations can continuously vet project management processes and capture best practices, providing efficiency as a result. *Understand future resource needs: by aligning the right resources to the right projects at the right time, organizations can ensure individual resources are fully leveraged and requirements are clearly understood. EPPM software also allows an organization to establish complete project capacity. Project Portfolio Optimization A key result of PPM is to decide which projects to fund in an optimal manner. Project Portfolio Optimization (PPO) is the effort to make the best decisions possible under these conditions.

Displays interpret the former U.S. Army fort, which was staffed from 1853–1870, the interactions between European Americans and Native Americans in roughly the same period, and both logging equipment and local narrow gauge railroad history of the region. Within the collection, there are trains, logging equipment, including a fully functional Steam Donkey engine, and an authentic Native American dug-out canoe. The Fort overlooks Humboldt Bay from a commanding position atop a bluff. The North Coast regional headquarters of the California State Parks system is located onsite. History =Early years, 1853–1860= With the discovery of gold in the Trinity River in Trinity County in May 1849, the stage was set for conflict between the Native Americans who lived in northwestern California and the settlers and gold seekers that flooded into the region. After repeated depredations by white settlers, Northern California tribes such as the Yurok, Karuk, Wiyot, and Hupa retaliated and the Army was sent to attempt to restore order. Fort Humboldt was established on January 30, 1853, by the Army as a buffer between Native Americans, gold-seekers and settlers under the command of Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Buchanan of the U.S. 4th Infantry Regiment. Like Buchanan, many of the soldiers of this unit were veterans of the Mexican–American War. Starting about 1853, Seth Kinman was hired as a market hunter to supply elk meat to the fort. Fort Humboldt was sited on a strategic location on the bluff overlooking Humboldt Bay and Bucksport, a town named after David Buck, a member of the Josiah Gregg exploration party.Historic Spots in California, Stanford University Press, 2002 In addition to serving to protect the local inhabitants, it was also a supply depot for posts around the California and Oregon borders such as Fort Gaston in Hoopa and Fort Bragg in northern Mendocino County. At its peak, the fort had 14 buildings all of crude plank construction. The fort was laid out in a typical military design with a quad at the center of the post which served as its parade grounds. Along with the two buildings that served as barracks for the enlisted men, there were quarters for the officers, an office, a hospital, a bakery, a storehouse/commissary, a guardhouse, a blacksmith's shop, and a stable. The period between the fort's establishment and the beginning of the Civil War was marked by many skirmishes between the settlers and the local tribes. One of the first major conflicts was the so-called Red Cap War, fought in the area around present-day Weitchpec and Orleans. Soldiers from Fort Humboldt were called into action to bring calm back to the area during this conflict. The leaders and soldiers of the fort were often criticized by settlers who sought a more violent response to Indian attacks. The infamous Indian Island Massacre of the Wiyot people occurred at the end of this period on 25 February 1860. The fort's commander at this time, Major Gabriel J. Rains, reported to his commanding officer that \\"Captain Wright's Company [of vigilantes] held a meeting at Eel River and resolved to kill every peaceable Indian - man, woman, and child.\\" The vigilantes were also known as the \\"Humboldt Volunteers, Second Brigade,\\" reported to have organized at Hydesville and the town called \\"Eel River\\" in 1860 is now named Rohnerville. The 1860 U.S. census provides a snapshot of life on the fort. Among its residents that year were Major Rains, his wife Mary, and their six children (including 2 daughters age 19 and 16). Also living at the fort were Captain Charles Lovell, his wife Margeret, and their four children; Lieutenant Alex Johnson, his wife Elizabeth, and their four children; Lieutenant James Dodwell, his wife Johanna, and their two children; and Lieutenant Edward Johnson, his wife Christiana, and their two children. The fort's physician Lafayette Guild and his wife Martha occupied the Surgeon's Quarters. In the barracks were 47 soldiers, all apparently living without their spouses. Among the many well-known soldiers who served at the fort was a young captain, Ulysses S. Grant, who was there for five months in 1854. Charles S. Lovell was promoted to major and commanded a brigade during the Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg. Robert C. Buchanan became a general during the Civil War. Other famous Civil War generals, George CrookCrook, George, General George Crook : his autobiography, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma, 15 April 1986. , 368 pages and Lewis C. Hunt, served here during this period. Gabriel J. Rains would become a brigadier general in the Confederate Army. Dr. Lafayette Guild would go on to serve directly under General Robert E. Lee as the Medical Director for the Army of Northern Virginia for all its major campaigns. =Civil War years, 1861–1865= By the summer of 1861 the American Civil War was well underway, and the resulting national conflict would bring major changes to Fort Humboldt. Federal soldiers were recalled to eastern battlefields and were replaced by units of the California Volunteers. These volunteers were drawn from local settlers who inaugurated a hard-line and violent policy toward the Native peoples. During the Civil War, Fort Humboldt was the headquarters of the District of Humboldt (also termed the Humboldt Military District), which was part of the Department of the Pacific. The District's posts included Fort Bragg and Fort Wright in northern Mendocino County, and extending north through Humboldt County to Fort Gaston in Hoopa and Fort Ter-Waw near Klamath (after the Great Flood of 1862, moved to Camp Lincoln near Crescent City). Other posts included Camp Curtis (in Arcata), Camp Iaqua, Fort Seward (in southern Humboldt County), and Camps Baker, Lyon, and Anderson. =Final years and abandonment, 1865–1867= The end of the Civil War brought more changes to Fort Humboldt. The California Volunteer units were disbanded in 1865, and U.S. regular troops returned to the fort from battlefields in the east. Six months after Appomattox, the first Regular Army unit to return to Fort Humboldt was Company E, 9th Infantry Regiment, on November 8, 1865 Company E was one officer and 49 enlisted men. The fort was staffed by 178 soldiers in October 1866. A month later, all forces, except one small detachment of soldiers, were withdrawn from Fort Humboldt. The fort becomes a sub-depot maintained primarily to provide supplies to Fort Gaston in Hoopa. Property belonging to the Quartermaster was auctioned on April 25, 1867. Items sold included 120 cords of wood, 2 boats with oars and sails, a heavy wagon, and an ambulance wagon. On September 14, 1867, the last unit was withdrawn from Fort Humboldt and the post was abandoned, although the Humboldt County journalist Andrew Genzoli recorded that \\"January 1867 was the last Monthly Post Return for Fort Humboldt. Sergeant Antoine Schoneberger, Ordnance Sergeant, was on duty during the period 1866-1870.\\" The Humboldt Times reported the sale of other government property on August 10, 1870, including 32 buildings ($655) and 13 mules ($602). = Commanding officers = * Lieutenant Colonel Robert C.

Abandoned buildings Abandoned buildings Abandoned buildings Abandoned hospital building Abandoned building After abandonment by the military, the lands were transferred to the Department of the Interior on April 6, 1870, and the fort fell into ruin. However, units of the California National Guard used the area one final time in August 1893. One hundred and thirty-five soldiers from the Second Artillery Regiment, California National Guard, arrived in the Steamer Pomona on August 17, and marched through Eureka to Fort Humboldt.\\"On the Tented Field,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, August 18, 1893, 3 In 1893, the land and its one remaining building were sold to W. S. Cooper. Cooper reportedly subdivided the property as soon as he acquired it, naming the new subdivision Fort Humboldt Heights. Cooper's daughter reported that on two occasions her father partially restored the remaining building as he realized its future importance. In 1894 a sentry box from Fort Humboldt was exhibited at a fair in San Francisco. According to a newspaper article, \\"Among the Humboldt exhibits there is one which stirs the heart of every patriot and awakens memories of the nation's great captain. It is the original sentry-box of Fort Humboldt, here General Grant did duty when he was there.\\"An Outdoor View. The Mid-Winter Fair in its Larger Features,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 7, 1894, 3 The old cavalry barn was destroyed by fire on October 21, 1895. On February 7, 1925, the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a bronze plaque which reads - \\"Fort Humboldt. Occupied by U.S. troops from 1853 to 1865 . General U. S. Grant was stationed here in 1853.\\" The plaque is still at the park, though hidden by trees. The tablet is bronze mounted on a huge rock blasted from Medicine Rock near Trinidad. The original plaque was stolen and was later replaced by the Daughters of the American Revolution. In 1929, the \\"Fort Humboldt Post\\" of the American Legion spent several days restoring fort buildings. The first wireless radio station in Humboldt County was located at Fort Humboldt. The United Wireless Telegraph Company began operating the station around 1900 with the call sign \\"PM Eureka.\\" This was many years before Humboldt County had a \\"wired\\" telegraph which ran south to Petaluma. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company took over from 1911 to 1917, changing the call sign to \\"KPM\\". Also during this era the hospital building received some restoration. Upon Cooper's death in 1928, his wife gave the land to the city of Eureka. = Restoration = Fort Humboldt stands out as one of the first sites in Eureka recognized and preserved for its historic value. According to one historian, \\"Mr. Cooper was aware of the importance of the lonely Fort. He spent $1,500 to restore the former hospital to a condition as near as possible to what it had been originally.\\" Cooper eventually worked with California State Senator Selvage to pass a bill that would appropriate $32,000 for the State to purchase Fort Humboldt. However, the bid to purchase Fort Humboldt for the public met with local opposition. For example, an editorial in the Blue Lake Advocate stated: \\"The whole scheme is a silly outburst of a maudlin sentimentalism which is simply ridiculous and is the laughing stock of the community. To take $32,000 from the taxpayer for the state to buy a few acres of land suitable only for a potato patch or a truck garden will be paying too much\\" (4 February 1906). Public sentiment against the purchase won out, but the Cooper family continued to preserve the fort site until W.S. Cooper's death. At that time, his wife and daughter donated the land and the one remaining building to the City of Eureka. The City accepted the donation and the site was dedicated for use as a public park. In the 1930s, local veteran organizations became interested in restoration of the fort. They took pictures, sent to the National Archives in Washington, D.C. for plans and specifications of the fort, and began restoration of the area and development of a museum. The job turned out to be larger than they could do, and soon the Works Progress Administration was worked into the project. Fort Humboldt was registered as a California Historical Landmark on January 11, 1935. Also during the 1930s, the \\"Days of General Grant\\" was a four-day celebration centering on the Fourth of July. Local businesses went all-out making storefronts look like pioneer days. The male citizens grew beards, and both men and women dressed in 19th century clothing. The celebration repeated four or five years in a row. Prior to the fourth annual celebration in 1939, the Humboldt Standard newspaper wrote that \\"it is an event which holds promise of becoming one of the lasting pioneer pageants of the West, comparable in importance to the Salinas Rodeo, the Pendleton Roundup, and the Portland Rose Festival.\\" By the 1940s the fort had become a Eureka city museum devoted to General Grant and local memorabilia. At some point, statues of General Grant and General Robert E. Lee (which were apparently made of wood) were placed in the park and were still there in 1947 as can be seen in the Shuster aerial photographs from that year. In 1952 Robert Madsen was elected mayor of Eureka, and during his administration more headway was made toward actual restoration of the fort, as the city council showed a great deal of interest in the project. Through informal meetings with the Humboldt County Board of Supervisors, it was decided to approach the State Division of Beaches and Parks to see if they were interested. In the summer of 1952 representatives of the State attended a luncheon meeting held in Eureka and there stated they were interested in setting the fort up as a state monument. They explained that they would eventually make an authentic restoration. In 1955 the area was deeded to the State of California with the understanding that the state would reconstruct the historic buildings and interpret the settlement of the northern California coast. Ranger C. D. Thompson was the first Monument Supervisor and began living at the fort in 1956. He first remodeled the old building into an office for District One of the Division of Beaches and Parks. The office was headquarters for the District Supervisor, whose staff consisted of the Assistant District Supervisor, a secretary, the Ranger-Monument Supervisor, district carpenter foreman, district accounting technician, and possibly a landscape architect and typist. An archeological survey was conducted during the late 1950s by Donald Jewell and John Clemmer. The Timber Heritage Association's web site states that the present logging display at the park was established in 1962. right Fort Humboldt was designated a State Historic Park in 1963. The park seems to have been nominated to the National Register of Historical Places in September 1970 (NPS Reference # 70000927). Some restoration ensued, with the hospital the sole remaining building of the original construction. The General Plan, created in 1978, developed by California State Parks, calls for a re-creation of the entire fort complex. Although the Surgeon's Quarters was re-created in 1985, this General Plan has been slow to be implemented. Several archeological digs were also conducted during this period and a bronze plaque stating that the fort is California Historical Landmark #154, was placed near the parking lot about 1980. In 1986 exhibits were installed in the hospital to tell the story of the fort and the intercultural conflicts. = Late 20th century and a new millennium = Redwood log loaded on an early 20th-century flatbed railcar, historic logging outdoor museum In more recent years, several Civil War re-enactments were held at the fort in the 1990s, but were moved to Fortuna in 1998. In 2000, students from the University of California Cooperative Extension Master Gardener Program planted a historic garden next to the hospital which contains medicinal, edible, and ornamental plants typically found in a 19th-century garden. This garden received a \\"Keep Eureka Beautiful\\" Award of Merit in 2001. The park marked Fort Humboldt's 150th anniversary in January 2003. A color guard from Eureka High School's Naval Junior ROTC hoisted a replica American flag with 36 stars. The original flag that was first raised over the fort in 1853 was also on display. This flag was kept by the soldier (Private Joseph Snedden) who helped raise it. Snedden became a Humboldt County resident after he left the Army and eventually gave the flag to Mrs. Vera O'Conner-Berry. She, in turn, gave the flag to the Redwood Forest Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1923. This organization started a preservation project in 1990s to stabilize the flag. The flag is now kept by the Regent of the Redwood Forest Chapter. In October 2008 permanent interpretive panels went on display in the nearby Bayshore Mall's food court. These eight panels, part of a collaborative project between California State Parks and the North Coast Redwood Interpretive Association, explore the early frontier life of Fort Humboldt and Buck's Port where the mall now sits. In 2009 Fort Humboldt was one of 48 California state parks slated for closure due to the state's budget crisis. Due to public opposition, the closures were not carried out. Collections The steam donkey in the park In addition to various displays of the trappings of military service and a vintage mountain howitzer cannon, the hospital building houses artifacts and particularly rousing accounts (including extensive signage) of the Native American experience of European settlers. A culturally and historically correct dugout canoe constructed of the heart of a redwood tree is on display. Though not directly related to the military history of the site, fully operational trains that operated on local standard gauge railroads in the early days of logging are present on the site. The logging equipment exhibit includes a Donkey engine. Invented in the 1880s by John Dolbeer of the local Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company, the machine is included among other logging equipment showcasing advances over the 150 years of local logging history. Visitor information Permanent displays are augmented by special events during the year. Of particular note are the prominent views of Humboldt Bay, the Samoa peninsula, and portions of Eureka from the bluff occupied by the park and structures. The park entrance is located one block off U.S. Route 101 near the Bayshore Mall in Eureka.

Lieutenant Commander Pierce was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. John R. Pierce was laid down by the Bethlehem Steel Co., Staten Island, New York on 24 March 1944 and launched on 1 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Mary Taylor Pierce, widow of Lieutenant Commander Pierce. The ship was commissioned on 30 December 1944 at Brooklyn Navy Yard, Commander C. R. Simmers in command.  Service history  = World War II = Following shakedown off Bermuda, John R. Pierce operated out of Norfolk, Virginia during the spring of 1945, training destroyer crews and conducting antisubmarine warfare (ASW) patrols along the eastern seaboard. She sailed on 17 June for duty in the Pacific, arrived Pearl Harbor on 6 July. Departing on 12 August as escort for an aircraft carrier-cruiser striking force sent to attack Wake Island, she was ordered to cease offensive operations on 15 August. She then proceeded via Eniwetok to Japan and arrived Wakayama, Honshū on 15 September as escort for a convoy of occupation troops. Crew members were the first Americans to enter Hiroshima after the atomic bomb attack. = Post war = For the next three months, she operated in the Japanese Inland Sea, covering occupation landings and assisting in the liberation of Allied POWs. She sailed on 21 December from Kure, Honshū, to Shanghai, China, to support the Chinese Nationalists in their conflict with the Communists for control of the mainland. She also conducted the \\"North China Omnibus Courier Run\\" between China and Korea until 6 March 1946, when she departed Qingdao, China, for the United States. Arriving at San Francisco on 27 March, she deactivated 16 September. John R. Pierce then sailed for San Diego on 17 January 1947, decommissioned 24 January and entered the San Diego Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet on 1 May. John R. Pierce recommissioned on 11 April 1949, Commander O. W. Goepner in command. Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, she departed on 11 July for Norfolk. Arriving on 5 August, she commenced twelve months of Atlantic operations that extended from Greenland to the Panama Canal Zone. Under the command of Commander J. R. Wadleigh, she cleared Norfolk on 8 August 1950 for duty with the 6th Fleet. Before returning to the United States on 23 January 1951, she operated in the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Crete and along the western coast of Europe from England to Norway. = Korea = For more than 15 months, John R. Pierce operated out of Norfolk along the Atlantic coast; then she departed on 15 May 1952 for duty in the Far East. Sailing via the Panama Canal, San Diego and Pearl Harbor, she arrived Yokosuka, Japan on 18 June. With Commander O. C. Foote, Jr. in command, she sailed on 20 June for blockade and bombardment operations against Communist forces along the east coast of Korea. From Chongjin to Songjin, she conducted interdiction firing and \\"anti-mine, anti- junk and anti-fishing\\" patrols. While engaging enemy shore batteries at Songjin on 6 August, she sustained three hits from enemy fire, but continued interdiction patrols until 11 October. She then departed for the United States via the Indian Ocean, Suez and Gibraltar, arriving Norfolk 12 December. = 1954–1973 = From 5 January 1954 to 1 April 1962 John R.

When not conducting operations with the 6th Fleet, she operated out of her home port on training exercises and readiness operations in the Atlantic and the Caribbean. When in the Mediterranean, fleet operations carried her the length and breadth of the sea, and deployments in 1954 and 1956 sent her, in addition, to the coast of Western Europe. On 1 October 1956, 75 miles south of Villefranche, the ship was on aerial gunnery exercise firing at a towed aerial target, when at 0950, a shell exploded in the breech of mount 53, killing a member of the mount and seriously wounding nine others. Three of the injured were in grave condition and later died. Doctors from were taken by helicopter to the destroyer, and then transferred the wounded to the cruiser at sea. Then, Salem took the men to Villefranche to be transported to Nice Airport, France, where a C-119 Flying Boxcar waited to fly them to a military hospital in Frankfurt, Germany. One of the seriously wounded was Ensign John T. Pierce, son of John R. Pierce, for whom the ship was named. After the wounded were transferred, John R. Pierce went to Cannes, France and arrived on 2 October. She stayed there until 15 October and then got under way for the states. She refueled at São Miguel in the Azores on 20 October and again in Bermuda on 25 October, arriving in Norfolk on 27 October. From there, she went to the Philadelphia Naval Yard for repairs. Engaged primarily in conducting ASW barrier patrols and screening carrier flight operations, John R. Pierce responded when the Syrian Army threatened King Hussein's pro-Western government of Jordan during August and September 1957, destroyers, including John r. Pierce, patrolled the sea lanes of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea to guard against possible intervention by Egypt. She returned to the same area in December 1958 to bolster the security of Lebanon, recently threatened by the Soviet-backed United Arab Republic. Following the assassination of General Trujillo on 27 May 1961, the destroyer patrolled off the Dominican Republic. Returning to Norfolk 1 April 1962 from her seventh Mediterranean cruise, she sailed on 15 May to participate in Project Mercury recovery operations following Lieutenant Commander M. Scott Carpenter's scheduled three-orbit flight in Aurora 7. On 24 April she steamed 206 miles at flank speed from her designated position in the Atlantic Recovery Area east of Puerto Rico and recovered the floating space capsule. After delivering it safely at Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, the next day, she returned to Norfolk 28 May before resuming duty in the Caribbean. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, under the command of Commander J. W. Foust, John R. Pierce departed Norfolk 22 October; joined the quarantine force on 24 October; and during the next five days, investigated 13 ships. On 28 October, the Soviets agreed to the American demands, thus alleviating a tense and crucial crisis. John R. Pierce departed from her assigned position the following day, but she continued a Caribbean sea-vigil from Jamaica to the Canal Zone until returning to Norfolk 14 December. She departed home port on 29 March 1963 for the Mediterranean and the Middle East. After two weeks of maneuvers with the 6th Fleet, she transited the Suez Canal on 30 April and commenced an 11-week cruise through the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf. Returning to the Mediterranean 16 July, she resumed fleet operations. On 14 August she rescued three survivors of a plane that splashed off her starboard bow while attempting an emergency landing on . Departing Palma, Majorca, 24 August, she arrived Norfolk 4 September. John R. Pierce spent the next year operating out of Norfolk; and during off-shore surveillance patrols in January 1964 she escorted five Cuban boats, which were illegally fishing in U.S. territorial waters, to Key West for internment. Once again she departed Norfolk for the Mediterranean 8 October. Reaching Naples late in the month, she joined the 6th Fleet and through the remainder of the year operated along the western coast of Italy. John R. Pierce returned to Norfolk 27 February 1965. She reported to Commandant of the 3rd Naval District in Brooklyn, New York, for duty as a reserve training ship and began a schedule of 2-week training cruises for naval reservists. She continued this duty into 1973.  Awards  John R. Pierce received one battle star for service during the Korean War.  References  *  External links  * navsource.org: USS John R.

He played hurling with his local club Slieverue and was a member of the Kilkenny senior inter-county team from 1949 until 1960. Buggy later served as the 27th president of the Gaelic Athletic Association from 1982 until 1985. Playing career =Club= Born in Slieverue, County Kilkenny, Buggy played his club hurling with his local Slieverue club. He won one senior county title with the club in 1954. =Inter-county= Buggy first came to prominence on the inter- county scene as a member of the Kilkenny senior team in the late 1940s. He made his championship debut in 1949 and won his first Leinster the following year in 1950. Kilkenny later played Tipperary in an unexciting final which Tipp won by a point. Three years later in 1953 Buggy won a second Leinster medal; however, Kilkenny were later defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 1957 Buggy won his third Leinster title before lining out in his second All-Ireland final. Waterford provided the opposition on that occasion in an exciting championship decider. Waterford led by six points with fifteen minutes to go, however, Kilkenny stormed back with two quick goals to win the game by a point giving Buggy an All-Ireland medal. The following year he won a fourth Leinster title before being later beaten by Tipperary in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 1959 Buggy won his fifth Leinster title before lining out in a third All-Ireland final. Once again Waterford provided the opposition, however, the game ended in a draw. In the replay it was the Déise who emerged victorious by seven points. Buggy retired from inter-county hurling in 1960. =Provincial= Buggy also won a Railway Cup medal with Leinster in 1954. Administrative roles Buggy began his administrative career with the Slieverue club at the age of 18 when he served as secretary of the minor section of the club. He later filled every available administrative position on the club's committee. As well as becoming a club administrator, Buggy was also elected as the Slieverue representative on the Kilkenny Southern Board in 1947, before being elected as one of the club's delegates to the Kilkenny County Board in 1950. He remained on the board until 1955 when he was elected to the Leinster Council. Buggy rose to the position of vice- chairman before gaining promotion to the position of chairman between 1978 and 1980. =GAA presidency= Buggy was officially nominated as the Kilkenny candidate for President of the GAA in January 1981. He also received the backing of Offaly and Wicklow. In the election in Killarney on 29 March 1981, he defeated Mick Loftus, the Chairman of the Connacht Council, by 145 votes to 136 and was elected on the fifth count. As president he presided over the centenary celebrations of the organisation in 1984 and was generally regarded as an able administrator, particularly close to the grass-root membership. Personal life Buggy also managed the Leinster team to five consecutive Railway Cup victories from 1971 until 1975. Very proud of his native roots, Buggy was vociferous in the campaign to keep Slieverue in County Kilkenny amid moves to have it incorporated into the expanding City of Waterford as a suburb on the northern bank of the river Suir. He died on 15 May 2013, aged 84.

Sir William Erle PC QC FRS (1 October 179328 January 1880) was an English lawyer, judge and Whig politician. Early career Born at Fifehead Magdalen, Dorset, William was the son of the Rev. Christopher Erle of Gillingham, Dorset and Margaret née Bowles, a relative of the poet William Lisle Bowles. His younger brother Peter Erle went on to be a Charity Commissioner. Erle was educated at Winchester College and at New College, Oxford where he graduated BCL in 1818 and held a fellowship until 1834. Having been called to the Bar at the Middle Temple on 26 November 1819 he went on the western circuit. Here he slowly acquired a reputation for thoroughness, rather than brilliance, and a fair share of remunerative practice. He was admitted ad eundem a member of the Inner Temple on 11 June 1822, and became a bencher of that society on 18 November 1834, and in 1844, Treasurer. He also purchased a warrant as counsel at the Palace Court which had jurisdiction in all private law actions within 12 miles (19 km) of Whitehall. In 1834, he married Amelia, eldest daughter of the Rev. David Williams, warden of New College and prebendary of Winchester, thereby vacating his fellowship. The same year he took silk. He sat in the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1837 to 1841 for the City of Oxford but he never spoke in the house, voting steadily with his party. He was appointed counsel to the Bank of England in 1844 and did not seek reelection to parliament. Judge Although of opposite politics to Lord Lyndhurst, Erle was made by him a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1845, has 1844 becoming serjeant-at-law and being knighted. He was transferred to the Queen's Bench in the following year, and on 23 March 1849, at Brecon Lent Assizes tried the case of Moondyne Joe and an accomplice, charged with burglary and stealing. The pair pleaded not guilty but were convicted and Erle sentenced them to ten years' penal servitude.On 24 June 1859, Erle came back to the Common Pleas as Chief Justice upon the promotion of Sir Alexander Cockburn, at the same time being sworn to the Privy Council. Erle was regarded as what lawyers call a \\"strong\\" judge in that he exhibited the power of rapidly grasping the material facts of a case, and coming to a decided conclusion upon their legal effect. He aimed at strict impartiality, but at the same time he was very tenacious of his own opinion. His chief characteristic was said to be \\"masculine sense\\" and his mind \\"lacking in flexibility and subtlety\\". His speech was deliberate, \\"even to monotony\\", and he had a faint regional accent. He decided a large number of important contract cases but is possibly best remembered for his judgments in the Swinfen will case, in particular Kennedy v. Broun (1863) in which he held that there could be no contract of hiring and service for advocacy in litigation. He was a member of the Trades Union Commission of 1867, and appended to the report of the commissioners, published in 1868, a memorandum on the law relating to trades unions, which he published separately in the following year. It consists of two chapters treating respectively of the common and the statute law relating to the subject, and an appendix on certain leading cases and statutes. It was a very lucid exposition of the law as it then stood. Erle endorsed the minority report of the Commission but it was his liberal view that ultimately influenced parliament and led to the Trade Union Act 1871. He retired in 1866, receiving the highest praise for the ability and impartiality with which he had discharged the judicial office. On the last occasion of his sitting in court on 26 November the Attorney-General, Sir John Rolt, on behalf of the Bar, expressed his sense of the great qualities of which Erle had given proof during his tenure of office, in terms so eulogistic that the judge, though naturally somewhat reserved and undemonstrative, was visibly moved. Private life The celtic cross on Gibbet Hill During the rest of his life Erle resided chiefly at his modest seat, Bramshott, near Liphook, Hampshire, interesting himself in parochial and county affairs. Though no sportsman he was very fond of horses, dogs, and cattle. His personal appearance was that of a country gentleman, his complexion being said to be \\"remarkably fresh and ruddy, his eyes keen and bright.\\" In 1851, he erected a celtic cross on Gibbet Hill, Hindhead on the former site of a public gibbet in order to dispel the fear of the residents.The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition has this as an unmarked memorial erected after his death (). He died at his estate at Bramshott. He left no children. Honours *Doctor of Civil Law, University of Oxford (1857); *Fellow of the Royal Society (1860); *Honorary Fellow, New College, Oxford.

His father was a general officer and he began life as a page in the court of King Charles III. He entered the church and was provided for by a prebend at Zaragoza. In his memoirs, Manuel de Godoy asserts that Escoiquiz sought to gain his favor by flattery. There is every reason to believe that this is an accurate statement of the ease. The mere fact that he was selected to be the tutor of the heir-apparent, Ferdinand, afterwards King Ferdinand VII, is of itself a proof that he exerted himself to gain the goodwill of the reigning favorite. In 1797 he published a translation of Young's Night Thoughts, which does not of itself show that he was well acquainted with English, for the version may have been made with the help of the French. In 1798 he published a long and worthless so-called epic on the conquest of Mexico. Escoiquiz was in fact a busy and pushing member of the literary clique which looked up to Godoy as its patron. But his position as tutor to the heir to the throne excited his ambition. He began to hope that he might play the part of those court ecclesiastics who had often had an active share in the government of Spain. As Ferdinand grew up, and after his marriage with a Neapolitan princess, he became the center of a court opposition to Godoy and to his policy of alliance with France. Escoiquiz was the brains, as far as there were any brains, of the intrigue. His activity was so notorious that he was exiled from court, but was consoled by a canonry at Toledo. This half measure was as ineffective as was to have been expected. Escoiquiz continued to be in constant communication with the prince. Toledo is close to Madrid, and the correspondence was easily maintained. He had a large share in the conspiracy of the Escorial which was detected on 28 October 1807. He was imprisoned and sent for trial with other conspirators. But as they had appealed to Napoleon, who would not suffer his name to be mentioned, the government had to allow the matter to be quieted, and the prisoners were acquitted. After the outbreak at Aranjuez on 17 March 1808, in which he had a share, he became one of the most trusted advisers of Ferdinand. The new king's decision to go to meet Napoleon at Bayonne was largely inspired by him. In 1814 Escoiquiz published at Madrid his Idea Sencilla de las razones que motivaron el viage del Rey Fernando VII a Bayona (\\"Honest representation of the causes which inspired the journey of King Ferdinand VII to Bayonne\\"). It is a valuable historical document, and contains a singularly vivid account of an interview with Napoleon. Escoiquiz was far too firmly convinced of his ingenuity and merits to conceal the delusions and follies of himself and his associates. He displays his own vanity, frivolity and futile cleverness with much unconscious humour, but, it is only fair to allow, with some literary dexterity. When the Spanish royal family was imprisoned by Napoleon, Escoiquiz remained with Ferdinand at Valencay. In 1813 he published at Bourges a translation of John Milton's Paradise Lost. When Ferdinand was released in 1814 he came back to Madrid in the hope that his ambition would now be satisfied, but the king was tired of him, and was moreover resolved never to be subjected by any favorite. After a very brief period of office in 1815 he was sent as a prisoner to Murcia. Though he was afterwards recalled, he was again exiled to Ronda, where he died on 27 November 1820.

Community gardens utilize either individual or shared plots on private or public land while producing fruit, vegetables, and/or plants grown for their attractive appearance. Around the world, community gardens can fulfill a variety of purposes such as aesthetic and community improvement, physical or mental well- being, or land conservation. Background Crops at the former South Central Farm in Los Angeles, California, United States According to Marin Master Gardeners, \\"a community garden is any piece of land gardened by a group of people, utilizing either individual or shared plots on private or public land\\". Community gardens provide fresh products and plants as well as contributing to a sense of community and connection to the environment and an opportunity for satisfying labor and neighborhood improvement. They are publicly functioning in terms of ownership, access, and management, as well as typically owned in trust by local governments or not for profit associations. Community gardens vary widely throughout the world. In North America, community gardens range from familiar \\"victory garden\\" areas where people grow small plots of vegetables, to large \\"greening\\" projects to preserve natural areas, to tiny street beautification planters on urban street corners. Some grow only flowers, others are nurtured communally and their bounty shared. There are even non-profits in many major cities that offer assistance to low- income families, children groups, and community organizations by helping them develop and grow their own gardens. In the UK and the rest of Europe, closely related \\"allotment gardens\\" can have dozens of plots, each measuring hundreds of square meters and rented by the same family for generations. In the developing world, commonly held land for small gardens is a familiar part of the landscape, even in urban areas, where they may function as market gardens. They also practice crop rotations with versatile plants such as peanuts, tomatoes and much more. Community gardens are often used in urban neighborhoods to alleviate the food desert effect. Food accessibility described in urban areas refers to residents who have limited access to fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables. Food deserts often serve lower-income neighborhoods usually in which residents are forced to rely on unhealthy food options such as expensive processed foods from convenience stores, gas stations, and fast-food restaurants. Community gardens provide accessibility for fresh food to be in closer proximity located in local neighborhoods. Community gardens can help expand the realm for ensuring residents’ access to healthy and affordable food in a community. Community gardens may help alleviate one effect of climate change, which is expected to cause a global decline in agricultural output, making fresh produce increasingly unaffordable.Harris, E (2009). \\"The role of community gardens in creating healthy communities\\", Australian Planner, v. 46, no. 2 (June 2009) pp. 24–27. Community gardens are also an increasingly popular method of changing the built environment in order to promote health and wellness in the face of urbanization. The built environment has a wide range of positive and negative effects on the people who work, live, and play in a given area, including a person's chance of developing obesity Xu, Y., & Wang, F. (2015). Built environment and obesity by urbanicity in the U.S. Health & Place, 34, 19–29.. Community gardens encourage an urban community's food security, allowing citizens to grow their own food or for others to donate what they have grown. Advocates say locally grown food decreases a community's reliance on fossil fuels for transport of food from large agricultural areas and reduces a society's overall use of fossil fuels to drive in agricultural machinery.: Kishler, Les. Opinion: community gardens are a serious answer to food supplies, health (2010, March 18) San Jose Mercury News. A 2012 op-ed by community garden advocate Les Kishler examines how community gardening can reinforce the so-called \\"positive\\" ideas and activities of the Occupy movement. Community gardens improve users’ health through increased fresh vegetable consumption and providing a venue for exercise. A fundamental part of good health is a diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, and other plant based foods.Hartley, L., Igbinedion, E., Thorogood, M., Clarke, A., Stranges, S., Hooper, L., & Rees, K. (2012). Increased consumption of fruit and vegetables for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Protocols Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Community gardens provide access to such foods for the communities in which they are located. Community gardens are especially important in communities with large concentrations of low socioeconomic populations, as a lack fresh fruit and vegetable availability plagues these communities at disproportionate rates. The gardens also combat two forms of alienation that plague modern urban life, by bringing urban gardeners closer in touch with the source of their food, and by breaking down isolation by creating a social community. Community gardens provide other social benefits, such as the sharing of food production knowledge with the wider community and safer living spaces.Harris, E (2009). Non-profit organizations in Kansas City and elsewhere help children, community groups, and low-income people grow gardens. \\"The role of community gardens in creating healthy communities\\", Australian Planner, v. 46, no. 2 (June 2009) pp. 24–27. Active communities experience less crime and vandalism.Melville Court, Chatham, Kent,\\" Moiser, Steve, Landscape Design, no306 (Dec. 2001/Jan. 2002) p. 34. =Ownership= Mobility Community gardening Land for a community garden can be publicly or privately held. One strong tradition in North American community gardening in urban areas is cleaning up abandoned vacant lots and turning them into productive gardens. Alternatively, community gardens can be seen as a health or recreational amenity and included in public parks, similar to ball fields or playgrounds. Historically, community gardens have also served to provide food during wartime or periods of economic depression. Access to land and security of land tenure remains a major challenge for community gardeners and their supporters throughout the world, since in most cases the gardeners themselves do not own or control the land directly.Visionaries and planners : the garden city movement and the modern community, Stanley Buder. New York: Oxford University Press, 1990. Some gardens are grown collectively, with everyone working together; others are split into clearly divided plots, each managed by a different gardener (or group or family). Many community gardens have both \\"common areas\\" with shared upkeep and individual/family plots. Though communal areas are successful in some cases, in others there is a tragedy of the commons, which results in uneven workload on participants, and sometimes demoralization, neglect, and abandonment of the communal model. Some relate this to the largely unsuccessful history of collective farming. Unlike public parks, whether community gardens are open to the general public is dependent upon the lease agreements with the management body of the park and the community garden membership. Open or closed-gate policies vary from garden to garden. However, in a key difference, community gardens are managed and maintained with the active participation of the gardeners themselves, rather than tended only by a professional staff. A second difference is food production: Unlike parks, where plantings are ornamental (or more recently ecological), community gardens often encourage food production by providing gardeners a place to grow vegetables and other crops. To facilitate this, a community garden may be divided into individual plots or tended in a communal fashion, depending on the size and quality of a garden and the members involved.Selected factors influencing the success of a community garden, by Gordon Arthur Clark. Kansas State University, 1980. = Types of gardens = There are multiple types of community gardens with distinct varieties in which the community can participate in. * Neighborhood gardens are the most common type that is normally defined as a garden where a group of people come together to grow fruits, vegetables and ornamentals. They are identifiable as a parcel of private or public land where individual plots are rented by gardeners at a nominal annual fee. * Residential Gardens are typically shared among residents in apartment communities, assisted living, and affordable housing units. These gardens are organized and maintained by residents living on the premise. * Institutional Gardens are attached to either public or private organizations and offer numerous beneficial services for residents. Benefits include mental or physical rehabilitation and therapy, as well as teaching a set of skills for job-related placement. * Demonstration Gardens are used for educational and recreational purposes in mind. They often offer short seminars or presentations about gardening, and provide the necessary tools to operate a community garden. A 20ft x 20ft community garden plot in Harrisonburg, Virginia. = Plot size = In Britain, the 1922 Allotment act specifies \\"an allotment not exceeding 40 [square] poles in extent\\"; since a rod, pole or perch is 5.5 yards in length, 40 square rods is 1210 square yards or 10890 square feet (equivalent to a large plot of 90 ft x 121 ft). In practice, plot sizes vary; Lewisham offers plots with an \\"average size\\" of \\"125 meters square\\". In America there is no standardized plot size. For example, plots of 3 m × 6 m (10 ft × 20 ft = 200 square feet) and 3 m x 4.5 m (10 ft x 15 ft) are listed in Alaska. Montgomery Parks in Maryland lists plots of 200, 300, 400 and 625 square feet. In Canada, plots of 20 ft x 20 ft and 10 ft x 10 ft, as well as smaller \\"raised beds\\", are listed in Vancouver. =Location= Community gardens may be found in neighborhoods, schools, hospitals, and on residential housing grounds. The location of a community garden is a critical factor in how often the community garden is used and who visits it. Exposure to a community garden is much more likely for an individual if they are able to walk or drive to the location, as opposed to public transportation. The length of travel time is also a factor. Those who live within a 15-minute or less travel distance are more likely to visit a community garden as compared to those with a longer travel time. Such statistics should be taken into consideration when choosing a location for a community garden for a target population. The site location should also be considered for its soil conditions as well as sun conditions. Solar conditions are of paramount importance, as above ground gardening is always possible. An area with a fair amount of morning sunlight and shade in the afternoon is most ideal. While specifics vary from plant to plant, most do well with 6 to 8 full hours of sunlight. When considering a location, areas near industrial zones may require soil testing for contaminants. If soil is safe, the composition should be loose and well-draining. However, if the soil at the location is unable to be used, synthetic soil may also be used in raised gardens beds or containers. Rushall Garden in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia is situated on land that was formerly a minor railway junction, now repurposed. Rushall Garden aerial view =Plant choice and physical layout= While food production is central to many community and allotment gardens, not all have vegetables as a main focus. Restoration of natural areas and native plant gardens are also popular, as are \\"art\\" gardens. Many gardens have several different planting elements, and combine plots with such projects as small orchards, herbs and butterfly gardens. Individual plots can become \\"virtual\\" backyards, each highly diverse, creating a \\"quilt\\" of flowers, vegetables and folk art. Regardless of plant choice, planning out the garden layout beforehand will help avoid problems down the line. According to the Arizona Master Gardener Manual, taking measurements of the garden size, sunlight locations and planted crops vs. yield quantity, will ensure a detailed record that helps when making decisions for the coming years. Other consideration to garden layout would be efficient use of space by using trellises for climbing crops, being mindful of taller plants blocking sunlight to shorter plants and plants that have similar life cycles close together. =Group and leadership selection= The community gardening movement in North America is inclusive, diverse, pro-democracy, and supportive of community involvement. Gardeners may be of any cultural background, young or old, new gardeners or seasoned growers, rich or poor. A garden may have only a few people active, or hundreds. Some community gardens “self-support” through membership dues, and others require a sponsor for tools, seeds, or money donations. Churches, schools, private businesses or parks and recreation departments supporters and community leaders. Finally, all community gardens have a structure. The organization depends in part on whether the garden is \\"top down\\" or \\"grassroots\\". There are many different organizational models in use for community gardens. Some elect boards in a democratic fashion, while others can be run by appointed officials. Some are managed by non-profit organizations, such as a community gardening association, a community association, a church, or other land-owner; others by a city's recreation or parks department, a school or University. Gardeners may form a grassroots group to initiate the garden, such as the Green Guerrillas of New York City,Green Guerillas or a garden may be organized \\"top down\\" by a municipal agency. In Santa Clara, California there is a non-profit by the name of AppleseedsCommunity Gardens as Appleseeds that offers free assistance in starting up new community gardens around the world. =Membership rules and fees= In most cases, gardeners are expected to pay annual dues to help with garden upkeep, and the organization must manage these fees. The tasks in a community garden are many, including upkeep, mulching paths, recruiting members, and fund raising. Rules and an 'operations manual' are both invaluable tools, and ideas for both are available at the ACGA.American Community Gardening Association =Health effects of community gardens= Community gardens have been shown to have positive health effects on those who participate in the programs, particularly in the areas of decreasing body mass index and lower rates of obesity. Studies have found that community gardens in schools have been found to improve average body mass index in children. A 2013 study found that 17% of obese or overweight children improved their body mass index over seven weeks. Specifically, 13% of the obese children achieved a lower body mass index in the overweight range, while 23% of overweight children achieved a normal body mass index. Many studies have been performed largely in low-income, Hispanic/Latino communities in the United States. In these programs, gardening lessons were accompanied by nutrition and cooking classes and optional parent engagement. Successful programs highlighted the necessity of culturally tailored programming. There is some evidence to suggest that community gardens have a similar effect in adults. A study found that community gardeners in Utah had a lower body mass index than their non- gardening siblings and unrelated neighbors. Administrative records were used to compare body mass indexes of community gardeners to that of unrelated neighbors, siblings, and spouses. Gardeners were less likely to be overweight or obese than their neighbors, and gardeners had lower body mass indexes than their siblings. However, there was no difference in body mass index between gardeners and their spouses which may suggest that community gardening creates healthy habits for the entire household. Participation in a community garden has been shown to increase both availability and consumption of fruits and vegetables in households. A study showed an average increase in availability of 2.55 fruits and 4.3 vegetables with participation in a community garden. It also showed that children in participating households consumed an average of two additional servings per week of fruits and 4.9 additional servings per week of vegetables. =Policy implications= There is strong support among American adults for local and state policies and policy changes that support community gardens. A study found that 47.2% of American adults supported such policies. However, community gardens compete with the interests of developers. Community gardens are largely impacted and governed by policies at the city level. In particular, zoning laws strongly impact the possibility of community gardens. The momentum for rezoning often comes from the public need for access to fruits and vegetables. Rezoning is necessary in many cities for a parcel of land to be designated a community garden, but rezoning doesn't guarantee garden will not be developed in the future. Further policies can be enacted to protect community gardens from future development. For example, New York State reached a settlement in 2002 which protected hundreds of community gardens which had been established by the Parks and Recreation Department GreenThumb Program from future development. Robert Fox Elder. (2005). protecting new york city's community gardens. New York University Environmental Law Journal, 13, 769–803. At times, zoning policy lags behind the development of community gardens. In these cases, community gardens may exist illegally. Such was the case in Detroit when hundreds of community gardens were created in abandoned spaces around the city. The city of Detroit created agricultural zones in 2013 in the middle of urban areas to legitimize the over 355 “illegal” community gardens.Kaffer, N. (2010). Planners recommend new zoning, lower tax rate for urban farms. Crain's Detroit Business, 26(13), 8. 91 U. Det. Mercy L. Rev. 345. Retrieved from www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic Examples =Australia= Community Garden, Melbourne, Australia The first Australian community garden was established in 1977 in Nunawading, Victoria followed soon after by Ringwood Community Garden in March 1980. = Japan = In Japan, rooftops on the train stations have been transformed into community gardens. Plots are rented to local residents for $980 per year. These community gardens have become active open spaces now. = Mali = Often externally supported, community gardens become increasingly important in developing countries, such as West African Mali to bridge the gap between supply and requirements for micro-nutrients and at the same time strengthen an inclusive development.Hans- Heinrich Bass, Klaus von Freyhold und Cordula Weisskoeppel: Water harvesting, tree protection: towards food security in the Sahel, Bremen 2013 = Spain = squatted social center Can Masdeu is home to one of the largest community gardens in Barcelona. Most older Spaniards grew up in the countryside and moved to the city to find work. Strong family ties often keep them from retiring to the countryside, and so urban community gardens are in great demand. Potlucks and paellas are common, as well as regular meetings to manage the affairs of the garden. = Taiwan = There is an extensive network of community gardens and collective urban farms in Taipei City often occupying areas of the city that are waiting for development. Flood-prone river banks and other areas unsuitable for urban construction often become legal or illegal community gardens. The network of the community gardens of Taipei are referred to as Taipei organic acupuncture of the industrial city.\\"The Community Gardens of Taipei\\" Casagrande, Marco (2010). P2P Foundation = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, community gardening is generally distinct from allotment gardening, though the distinction is sometimes blurred. Allotments are generally plots of land let to individuals for their cultivation by local authorities or other public bodies—the upkeep of the land is usually the responsibility of the individual plot owners. Allotments tend (but not invariably) to be situated around the outskirts of built-up areas. Use of allotment areas as open space or play areas is generally discouraged. However, there are an increasing number of community-managed allotments, which may include allotment plots and a community garden area, many of them overseen by the Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens (a registered charity). The community garden movement is of more recent provenance than allotment gardening, with many such gardens built on patches of derelict land, waste ground or land owned by the local authority or a private landlord that is not being used for any purpose. A community garden in the United Kingdom tends to be situated in a built-up area and is typically run by people from the local community as an independent, non-profit organisation (though this may be wholly or partly funded by public money). For example, Norwich's Fifth Quarter Community Garden. It is also likely to perform a dual function as an open space or play area (in which role it may also be known as a 'city park') and—while it may offer plots to individual cultivators—the organisation that administers the garden will normally have a great deal of the responsibility for its planting, landscaping and upkeep. An example inner-city garden of this sort is Islington's Culpeper Community Garden, which is a registered charity, or Camden's Phoenix Garden. =United States= See also * Community orchard  Notes  References Horticulture and gardening Localism (politics) ","title":"Community gardening"},{"id":"2826876","text":"Siglo Veintiuno or stylized Siglo XXI is a Guatemalan daily newspaper. Founded in 1990 by José Rubén Zamora, the paper earned a reputation for independent, high-risk reporting. In 1995, its staff won the International Press Freedom Awards of the Committee to Protect Journalists, and Zamora won several individual awards for his work with the paper.  History  Founded in 1990 by José Rubén Zamora, the paper advocated judicial and tax reforms, and reported on dangerous subjects including narcotics smuggling, human rights issues, guerrilla groups, and corruption in the government of President Jorge Serrano. As a result, Zamora and the staff received death threats and were subject to physical attacks. Three years later, Guatemala saw a constitutional crisis, in which Serrano suspended the constitution and dissolved Congress. He also instituted press censorship, surrounding the Siglo Veintiuno offices with national police forces. During this period, Zamora satirized the censorship by renaming the paper Siglo Catorce (\\"14th Century\\") and running stories covered in solid blocks of ink; he also faxed uncensored versions of the stories to newspapers in neighboring countries. The International Press Institute credits this clandestine reporting with contributing to Serrano's condemnation by the international community and his eventual flight from the country. Zamora and other staff members were attacked several times in connection with their reporting. In 1995, Zamora's car was driven off the road by two people who threatened to kill him for publishing allegations in Siglo Veintiuno that the military of Guatemala had links to organized crime. In May 1996, attackers drove past his parked car, throwing two grenades at it; Zamora was unhurt. In May 1996, Zamora left the paper following disagreements with its board of directors and founded a new paper, El Periódico.  Recognition  In 1995, Zamora and the Siglo Veintiuno staff won International Press Freedom Awards from the Committee to Protect Journalists, which recognize courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks, threats, or imprisonment. In the same year, Zamora won the Maria Moors Cabot Prize from Columbia University \\"for promoting press freedom and inter-American understanding\\". In 2000, he was named one of 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the 20th century by the International Press Institute.

Ellis and starring Samuel L. Jackson. It was released by New Line Cinema on August 18, 2006, in North America. The film was written by David Dalessandro, John Heffernan, and Sebastian Gutierrez and follows the events of hundreds of snakes being released on a passenger plane in an attempt to kill a trial witness. The film gained a considerable amount of attention before its release, forming large fanbases online and becoming an Internet phenomenon, due to the film's title, casting, and premise. In response to the Internet fan base, New Line Cinema incorporated feedback from online users into its production, and added five days of reshooting. Before and after the film was released, it was parodied and alluded to on television shows and films, fan- made videos, video games, and various forms of literature. Released in the United States and United Kingdom on August 18, 2006, the film received mixed reviews. Despite the immense Internet buzz, the film's gross revenue did not live up to expectations, earning US$15.25 million in its opening weekend. The film grossed US$62 million worldwide before its release on home video on January 2, 2007. Plot After witnessing a brutal murder instigated by California-based gang boss Eddie Kim on U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial against Kim in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom and a man using another bathroom are the first people killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable life raft. Flynn and flight attendant Claire regain control of the plane while Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, a tactical interrogation occurs wherein the dealer is injured by a snakebite. With Harris withholding the antivenom, the dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane and make them aggressive. Price injects the injured dealer with the antivenom and commandeers his supply of antivenom for the victims on the plane based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested and tried for death on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. Harris contacts Flynn, telling him that antivenom will be ready for the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on experience playing a flight simulator. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Despite his lack of real-world experience, Troy makes an emergency landing and the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and antivenom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a remaining snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to a ballistic vest he wore throughout the ordeal after his rescue from Kim's henchmen. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf. Cast Production The story is credited to David Dalessandro, a University of Pittsburgh administrator and first-time Hollywood writer. He developed the concept in 1992 after reading a nature magazine article about Indonesian brown tree snakes climbing onto planes in cargo during World War II. He originally wrote the screenplay about the brown tree snake loose on a plane, titling the film Venom. He soon revised it, expanding upon the premise to include a plague of assorted venomous snakes, then—crediting the film Aliens—revised it once again to include \\"lots of them loose in the fuselage of a plane.\\" Dalessandro's third draft of Venom was turned down by more than 30 Hollywood studios in 1995. In 1999, a producer for MTV/Paramount showed interest in the script, followed up by New Line Studios, which took over the rights for production. Originally, the film, under the working title \\"Snakes on a Plane\\", was going to be directed by Hong Kong action director Ronny Yu. Jackson, who had previously worked with Yu on The 51st State, learned about the announced project in the Hollywood trade newspapers and, after talking to Yu, agreed to sign on without reading the script based on the director, storyline, and the title. Initially New Line did not believe that Jackson had actually signed on to the project and had to call his agent to clarify. Jackson would later defend his choice of starring in the movie by stating \\"it was the kind of movie I would have gone to see when I was a kid\\" further clarifying \\"I feel sorry for all those people that are going through that whole trip of ‘Why would Samuel Jackson do something like this?’ and ‘It’s lowbrow.’ It's a movie. People go to movies on Saturday to get away from the war in Iraq and taxes and election news and pedophiles online and just go and have some fun and I like doing movies that are fun.” The film's B movie-esque title generated a lot of pre-release interest on the Internet. One journalist wrote that Snakes on a Plane is \\"perhaps the most internet-hyped film of all time\\". Much of the initial publicity came from a blog entry made by screenwriter Josh Friedman, who had been offered a chance to work on the script. The casting of Samuel L. Jackson further increased anticipation. At one point, the film was given the title Pacific Air Flight 121, only to have it changed back to the working title at Samuel Jackson's request. In August 2005, Samuel Jackson told an interviewer, \\"We're totally changing that back. That's the only reason I took the job: I read the title.\\" On March 2, 2006, the studio reverted the title to Snakes on a Plane. New Line hired two additional writers to smooth out the screenplay. Taking advantage of the Internet buzz for what had been a minor film in their 2006 line-up, New Line Cinema ordered five days of additional shooting in early March 2006 (principal photography had wrapped in September 2005). While re-shoots normally imply problems with a film, the producers opted to add new scenes to the film to change the MPAA rating from PG-13 to R and bring it in line with growing fan expectations. The most notable addition was a revision of a catchphrase from the film that was parodied on the Internet by fans of the film, capitalizing on Samuel L. Jackson's typically foul-mouthed and violent film persona: \\"Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!\\". Subsequently, the public responded favorably to this creative change and marketing strategy, leading some members of the press to speculate that \\"the movie has grown from something of a joke into a phenomenon\\". More than 450 snakes were used for filming to represent 30 different species of snakes. The different species include a Burmese python named Kitty (which the crew called Kong for film purposes), scarlet kingsnake (the non-venomous double for the eastern coral snake), milk snake, corn snakes, rattlesnakes, and mangrove snakes. The scarlet kingsnake and milk snake stood in for coral snakes, while a Florida kingsnake filled the role of the venomous Australian taipan (which attacks the couple having sex). About two-thirds of the snakes seen throughout the film were either animatronic or CGI. The snakes that were real were mostly the non-venomous ones that are never seen attacking anyone. The scenes where someone is clearly bitten were often done with animation. According to the DVD, all the snakes had production names, but only Scarface (an animated pit viper), Peanut (a cobra), and Kong are mentioned by name in the audio commentary. During filming, Samuel Jackson did not come into contact with any live snakes, due to a contract clause preventing snakes from being within (25 ft) of the actor. When the film was released in theaters, two live western diamondback rattlesnakes were released at a showing of the film on August 22, 2006, in Phoenix, Arizona. One snake had made its way into the lobby of the theater on its own, and another had been found in the parking lot. No one was harmed and the snakes were released back into the desert.

The music video appeared on the film's soundtrack as well as during the film's closing credits. In October 2005, Nathanial Perry and Chris Rohan recorded an audio trailer spoof, which helped fuel the Internet buzz. Perry and Rohan recorded the \\"motherfucking snakes\\" line in the audio trailer which was added to the film during the week of re-shoots. In July 2006, New Line Cinema signed a worldwide licensing agreement with the Cutting Corporation to produce an audiobook of the film. =Television= On August 15, 2006, Samuel L. Jackson guest featured on The Daily Show, opening with the film's catchphrase. Keith Olbermann featured stories about the film and Internet buzz several times on his MSNBC news program Countdown. In addition, G4's Attack of the Show! featured a semi-regular segment entitled \\"Snakes on a Plane: An Attack of the Show Investigation\\", and had a week dedicated to the film which included interviews and the appearance of hundreds of snakes on set. =Internet= Snakes on a Plane generated considerable buzz on the Internet after Josh Friedman's blog entry and mentions on several Internet portals. The title inspired bloggers to create songs, apparel, poster art, pages of fan fiction, parody films, mock movie trailers, and short film parody competitions. On July 6, 2006, the official Snakes on a Plane website started a promotional sweepstakes called \\"The #1 Fan King Cobra Sweepstakes\\". The contest made innovative use of the publicity-generating potential of the Internet, requiring contestants to post links on forums, blogs, and websites and collecting votes from the users of those sites. Many of the early fan-made trailers and later other viral videos and commercials circulated via YouTube, and captured media attention there with such titles as: Cats on a Plane (which was featured in Joel Siegel's review of Snakes on a Plane on Good Morning America), Snakes Who Missed the Plane, All Your Snakes Are Belong To Us (a spoof of the All your base are belong to us phenomenon), Steaks on a Train, and Badgers on a Plane (a spoof of \\"Badger Badger Badger\\"). Several websites also held contests about the film in fan-submitted short films and posters. In August 2006, Varitalk launched an advertising campaign in which fans could send a semi-personalized message in Samuel Jackson's voice to telephone numbers of their choosing. Within the first week, over 1.5 million calls were sent to participants. =Previews= In June 2006, New Line commissioned famed UK audio-visual film remixers and chop-up artists Addictive TV to cut and sample Snakes on a Plane to create trailers for the U.S. television networks. The official teaser trailer premiered before X-Men: The Last Stand, and the first official trailer appeared online on June 26, 2006. Another trailer circulated in July 2006, showing several of the snake attacks and a missing pilot and co-pilot. Rotten Tomatoes had video clips of the official trailers, as well as fan-made trailers. During a July 21, 2006 panel discussion at the Comic-Con Convention in San Diego, California, a preview clip from the film was shown to a crowd of more than 6,500 people. The panel included actors Samuel L. Jackson and Kenan Thompson, director David R. Ellis, and snake- handler Jules Sylvester. Release Snakes on a Plane debuted on August 18, 2006. The film opened in 3,555 theaters and had some late-night screenings on August 17. In a move meant to exploit the attention from the film, a straight- to-DVD Z-movie horror film with a supernatural twist, Snakes on a Train, was released on August 15, 2006, three days before the film's theatrical release. =Critical response= In mid-July 2006, New Line Cinema announced that it would not be showing any advance screenings for critics. As of October 2020, review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 69% based on 177 reviews, with an average score of 6.23/10 and the consensus: \\"Snakes on a Plane lives up to its title, featuring snakes on a plane. It isn't perfect, but then again, it doesn't need to be.\\" As of October 2020, Metacritic, which uses a weighted average rating system, the film earned 58/100 score based on 31 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Reviewers reported audiences cheering, applauding, and engaging in \\"call and response\\", noting that audience participation was an important part of the film's appeal. The Arizona Republic's Randy Cordova gave the film a positive review, calling the film \\"... an exploitation flick that knows what it wants to do, and it gets the job done expertly.\\" and a \\"... Mecca for B-movie lovers.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle enjoyed the film, asking his readers \\"... if you can find a better time at the movies this year than this wild comic thriller, let me in on it.\\" Boston Globe reviewer Ty Burr reacted to Samuel L. Jackson's performance by saying he \\"... bestrides this film with the authority of someone who knows the value of honest bilge. He's as much the auteur of this baby as the director and screenwriters, and that fierce glimmer in his eye is partly joy.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying that \\"after all the Internet hype about those motherfuckin' snakes on that motherfuckin' plane, the flick itself is a murky stew of shock effects repeated so often that the suspense quickly droops along with your eyelids.\\" David Denby of The New Yorker claimed that the film \\"... may mark a new participatory style in marketing, but it still gulls an allegedly knowing audience with the pseudo-morality of yesteryear.\\" Film critic and radio host Michael Medved criticized New Line Cinema for agreeing to re-shoot scenes so that the film would receive an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America to match fan expectations. He argued that the film would have grossed more revenue at the box office with a PG-13 rating, stating that the demographic most likely to be drawn to a movie titled Snakes on a Plane is males between the ages of 12 and 15. \\"My fourteen-year-old son, Danny, for instance, felt a powerful inclination to go out and see the movie with his two sleep-over friends this Sunday night,\\" he explained, \\"but I wouldn't permit it. It's rated R for good reason.\\" Medved ultimately awarded the film 2 1/2 stars out of 4 in a radio review, but said that he did so \\"grudgingly.\\" =Box office= Due to the Internet hype surrounding the film, industry analysts estimated that the film's opening box office would be between US$20-30 million. While Snakes on a Plane did narrowly beat Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby for the number one position during its opening weekend, it did not meet these estimates and grossed only $15.25 million in its opening days, a disappointment for New Line Cinema. In its second weekend, the film fell to sixth place with $6.4 million, a more than fifty percent drop from its opening weekend revenue. By the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $62,022,014 worldwide. Robert K. Shaye, the founder of New Line, stated that he was \\"disappointed\\" that Snakes on a Plane was a \\"dud\\" despite \\"higher expectations\\". The press declared that Snakes on a Plane was a \\"box office disappointment\\", with The New York Times reporting that after all the \\"hype online, Snakes on a Plane is letdown at box office\\" and Entertainment Weekly reporting that the film was an \\"internet-only phenomenon.\\" =Home media= Snakes on a Plane released on DVD December 26, 2006 in Region 2; December 28, 2006 in Region 4; and January 2, 2007 in Region 1. The DVD features commentaries, deleted and extended scenes, several featurettes, Cobra Starship's music video, and trailers. The U.S. Blu-ray was released on September 29, 2009. =TV version= The film received further attention when fans noticed the U.S. TV edit of the film purposely dubbed over foul language, replacing it with bowdlerized words for family audiences. An example is Samuel L. Jackson's line toward the end of the film, \\"I have had it with these motherfuckin' snakes on this motherfuckin' plane!\\", which is replaced with \\"I have had it with these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday- to-Friday plane!\\". = Adaptations = Black Flame published the novelization of the film, written by Christa Faust. The 405-page novel contains significant backstories for the characters and introduces other characters that were not featured in the film. Comic book writer Chuck Dixon wrote a comic book adaptation of the film. DC Comics released the two-issue miniseries on August 16, 2006 and September 27, 2006 under their Wildstorm imprint. Soundtrack The soundtrack for the film was released on August 15, 2006. The enhanced portion of the CD contains what was considered the \\"best of the best\\" of the amateur Internet creations inspired by the film, including the songs \\"Snakes on the Brain\\" by Captain Ahab and \\"Here Come the Snakes (Seeing Is Believing)\\" by Louden Swain.

It was developed by High Moon Studios (formerly Sammy Studios) and published by Capcom in the United States and by Ubisoft in Europe and Australia. The game mixes western, horror and steampunk genres, telling the story of Jericho Cross, an outlaw gunfighter in the late 19th-century American Frontier who has been turned into a vampire and forcibly recruited by the titular monster-hunting secret organization to fight against supernatural forces. Darkwatch was met with a generally positive critical reception, acclaimed in particular for its relatively unique Weird West setting and artistic merits. The game was accompanied by an extensive promotional campaign and was planned to be the first installment of a new media franchise, but its sequel got canceled in 2007 and the film adaptation remains in development hell.  Gameplay  A screenshot of first-person shooter gameplay in Darkwatch, without the HUD Darkwatch features a reputation system that affects player's abilities in addition to the player character Jericho's starting, neutral vampiric powers of \\"Blood Shield\\" (a regenerating force field), \\"Vampire Jump\\" (a double jump that can be aborted at any moment) and \\"Blood Vision\\" (a system of heat vision highlighting enemies and objects that also acts as a zoom). Through the game, Jericho is met with multiple choices of a good or evil variety, allowing the player to select morality awarding Jericho new powers, called \\"Brands\\", based on the choices he made.Cory Casciato, Darkwatch Conference Call #1 © Sammy Studios, gamershell.com. The good path powers are \\"Silver Bullet\\" (making the player's weapons cause more damage), \\"Fear\\" (confusing minor enemies), \\"Mystic Armor\\" (an extra shield system) and \\"Vindicator\\" (bolts of lightning destroying all nearby enemies). The evil powers are \\"Blood Frenzy\\" (granting an immunity to damage and extremely powerful melee attacks), \\"Turn\\" (turning undead enemies into allies), \\"Black Shroud\\" (stealing life force from nearby enemies) and \\"Soul Stealer\\" (destroying nearby enemies and stealing their souls). The powers can be activated for a limited time when the HUD's blood bar, which is fueled through collecting souls of the slain enemies, is completely full. Jericho's health is also restored through collecting the souls.Elliott Chin, Darkwatch Official Strategy Guide, BradyGames, 2005 (). During the daylight hours, Jericho's powers are gone, so he has to fight as a normal human, using a wide variety of weaponry, from a Darkwatch's standard-issue 24-shot Redeemer handgun to a crossbow firing explosive arrows and a rocket launcher, as well as melee combat.Mark Ryan Sallee, Darkwatch - xbox - Walkthrough and Guide - Page 2, GameSpy, Jan 12, 2005. In some missions, Jericho can drive a Gatling gun- equipped Coyote Steamwagon vehicle; using it or a horse changes perspective to the third-person view. During horse-riding rail shooter sequences, Jericho is granted unlimited ammunition and high attack speed, at the cost of only being able to use the Redeemer. =Multiplayer= The Xbox version has competitive multiplayer for up to 16 players online, although system link is not possible. The PlayStation 2 version does not offer any online connectivity and competitive multiplayer is limited to two players (or four players while using an optional multitap device) via split screen gameplay. In multiplayer matches, the players can pick up the \\"Silver Bullet\\", \\"Mystic Armor and \\"Blood Frenzy\\" powers as floating power-ups that activate immediately. The game's story mode is also available for split screen cooperative gameplay on the PlayStation 2, a feature absent from the Xbox version. In the co-op mode, both players play as a rank-and-file Darkwatch Regulators but cutscenes designed for the single-player mode and featuring Jericho Cross as the main character are left unchanged, causing a number of glaring continuity errors.  Plot  =Story= The game's story (narrated by Peter JasonPaul Green, Encyclopedia of Weird Westerns, Performing Arts, 2009, p.66.) follows the exploits of a wanted outlaw named Jericho Cross and his employment in an ancient vampire- hunting order known as the Darkwatch. After unwittingly releasing the Darkwatch's greatest enemy, a vampire lord named Lazarus Malkoth, Jericho is conscripted into the Darkwatch as an elite operative. Jericho, however, is slowly turning into a vampire himself, as a result of being bitten by Lazarus. The game outlines either Jericho's struggle for humanity or his descent into darkness, depending on the player's actions. The game begins in the Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho attempting to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a frequently mentioned and often visited location in the game. His actions inadvertently release Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him the curse of the vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Darkwatch agent Cassidy Sharp as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse whom he fed on and turned in a frenzy after being bitten by Lazarus. As the game progresses, Jericho finally makes his way to the Darkwatch Citadel, where he meets General Clay Cartwright, the current leader of the order. Cartwright puts him through Torture Maze, the Darkwatch initiation exercise which was designed as a test for Darkwatch Regulators, but Jericho gets a special version specially designed by Cartwright to kill him. When Jericho passes the test anyway, he begins to do missions for the Darkwatch. Missions include tasks ranging from fixing some of the damage he has caused to acquiring Darkwatch equipment, such as the Darklight Prism, a stone that allows vampires within its vicinity to both use their powers and walk in sunlight. On some of his missions Jericho is accompanied by other Darkwatch forces including his new partner, a sultry and vicious temptress named Tala. Eventually, during their night of passion, Tala lures him to bite her and inherits some portion of his power, transforming herself into a half-vampire creature similar to him.Darkwatch: Interview with the Vampire Cowboy, GameStar, April 11, 2004. She then betrays the Darkwatch from within, allowing hordes of the undead to invade its headquarters. A final showdown ensues with Lazarus, in which Jericho arises victorious, and a choice is given for him to side with either Cassidy or Tala. Either Jericho rids the West of the Curse of Lazarus, or he becomes the Curse; the player's choice determines how the game ends. If the character were to choose the good option, then the final fight will be against the vampiric Tala; if the player chooses to take Lazarus' curse for himself, then he must fight the ghost of Cassidy. The bad ending shows the now-monstrous Jericho killing Tala and riding into the night, while the good ending shows Cassidy's soul being released. = Characters = *Jericho Cross (voiced by Christopher Corey Smith): The protagonist of the game, a jaded American Civil War deserter and drifterNic Kelman, Video Game Art, Assouline Publishing, 2006, p.43. who became a gunslinger and train robber. During his \\"one last job\\", he releases Lazarus Malkoth from his prison in a failed attempt to steal the contents. While dueling with Lazarus, Jericho gets bitten and infected by the vampire curse. His already deadly skills are enhanced by his vampire powers that afford him superhuman strength, increased endurance, enhanced agility, and heightened senses, in the form of the bioluminescent red orb that regenerated from his empty eye socket. Shadow is Jericho's demonic horse that appears at his beckon. According to the developers, they created \\"deep psychological profiles of every character in the game\\" with \\"hope that Jericho's character arc — as this desperate lone wolf that is robbing trains with a subconscious death wish — makes a believable transition into this half-vampire hybrid gunslinger and will ultimately envelop the player in his destiny: which is a guy that can be either a hero or a terror. Basically, we just want people to care about this character and what happens to him — and I can't think of a first-person shooter that's really made us do that yet.\\" *Cassidy Sharp (voiced by Jennifer Hale): The game's first female protagonist. Cassidy is the agent who attempts to stop Jericho on the train in the game's opening sequence. After the explosion of Lazarus' prison, she joins Jericho but is soon murdered by Lazarus. Cassidy returns as a good ghost and befriends Jericho, aiding him in his mission to stop Lazarus. As a little girl, Cassidy was orphaned in a vampire attack and then raised as a ward of the Darkwatch. Eventually, she became the most serious and dangerous agent in the organisation, yet really she is also deeply insecure about herself.Jeremy Dunham, The World of Darkwatch, IGN, January 14, 2004. If fought as the final boss, she turns into an angel. *Tala (meaning \\"Stalking Wolf\\") (voiced by Rose McGowan): The game's second female protagonist. Tala is a Native American shaman and a power-hungry Darkwatch agent. When she was young, Tala lost her seer mother and became an outcast from her own tribe, fearful of her mediumship abilities.Jeremy Dunham, Darkwatch: And Death Came with Them..., IGN, August 10, 2005. Her father was then killed by a band of fur traders and she herself was kidnapped and abused by them, until her captors were killed by vampires. Tala was then herself rescued by the Darkwatch troops, who turned her into one of their own. However, her experiences made her extremely bitter, and she began pursuing ever more power at any cost, secretly desiring to get revenge upon the world for the death of her parents. Despite her ruthlessness, Tala quickly rose through the Darkwatch ranks due to her fearless battle efficiency.Darkwatch Character Bios Unveiled, FileFactory Gameworld Network, Aug 31, 2005. The developers described her as not evil but \\"just ambitious\\". Tala is the only character who uses kicks in the game, due to the artists deciding that \\"some of the combat moves the actress performed fit the character so well that we changed the combat system she's using.\\"Paul O'Connor, Developer Diaries  Darkwatch Full Moon: Volume VI, GameSpy, September 3, 2004. If fought as the final boss, she turns into a demon. According to GameSpy, Tala is \\"without question, the more difficult boss to battle.\\"Mark Ryan Sallee, Darkwatch - xbox - Walkthrough and Guide - Page 22, GameSpy, Jan 12, 2005. *Lazarus Malkoth (voiced by Keith Szarabajka): A Roman who first founded the Darkwatch society in 66 AD in order to battle the dark forces responsible for the decline of the Roman Empire. He eventually got possessed by a demon and himself became a powerful vampire and turned on the organization he founded, raising an undead army to aid him in his task. The Darkwatch then pursued Lazarus across Europe and later America. During the game's development, the villain's name was Scourge. *Clay Cartwright (voiced by Michael Bell): The brutal and scheming field commander of the Darkwatch. An American Civil War veteran in the rank of brigadier general, Cartwright snipes Jericho and enslaves him, forcing him to participate in a series of trials before inducting him into the organization.  Development  =Concept= An early concept art for the game's protagonist The development of the game began in the summer of 2002, when Sammy Studios' first internal development team, informally called \\"Team 1\\",Paul O'Connor, Developer Diaries  Darkwatch Full Moon: Volume I, GameSpy, April 5, 2004. decided to \\"bring a refreshing theme to a genre riddled with the stereotypical sci-fi, fantasy, and military themes,\\" an idea soon approved by the Sammy Corporation president Hajime Satomi.Paul O'Connor, Developer Diaries  Darkwatch Full Moon: Volume III, GameSpy, June 9, 2004. The original game concept was not very dark and the vampires \\"felt more like a cartoon property\\". In the early derivatives of the project, the game \\"looked more like something from Pixar\\" and its protagonist was supposed to be Chaz Bartlett, a \\"vaguely bumbling sort of comic relief character\\", described as an \\"Eastern dude who was a card cheat\\" similar to Bret Maverick. The game's lead designer and writer Paul O'Connor said that the original 'high concept' for Darkwatch was \\"Blade meets Men in Black in the Old West,\\" but \\"in the two years that the property has been in development, it has grown in other directions and taken on a life of its own. The game is quite a bit darker than Blade, and we’ve completely lost the tongue-in-cheek feeling of Men in Black.\\" He added it \\"leans toward the Army of Darkness side of things, though without the slapstick,\\" and \\"with the accessibility of Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\" The turning point for setting a much darker and mature tone was the final iteration of Jericho's character design.Paul O'Connor, Developer Diaries  Darkwatch Full Moon: Volume IV, GameSpy, July 8, 2004. Tala was originally intended to also be a player character, but the studio's marketing department \\"didn’t think that would fly.\\"LaPensée (Lameman), B. A. (2010). \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Sultry: Indigenous Women in Video Games.\\" Paper presented at Unpacking the Indigenous Female Body, April 23–24, 2010, Vancouver, British Columbia. =Production= The game was developed for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox side by side, with a PC version initially described as \\"possible\\". Creative director Emmanuel Valdez said that \\"for the longest time we were debating whether or not to bring it out for GameCube,\\" before deciding \\"there's just not a lot there in the GameCube market right now.\\"Jeremy Dunham, The Darkwatch Interview, IGN, January 16, 2004.

The game was \\"intentionally designed as a cross between Halo and Silverado.\\" O'Connor said Halo was \\"of course\\" an inspiration, comparing Darkwatch to the horror aspects of Halo, and senior designer Brent Disbrow said he expected it to \\"stand on par with games like Halo 2.\\" Other video game inspirations recounted by O'Connor and Valdez included Half-Life, Medal of Honor, Metroid Prime and TimeSplitters. Lead level designer Matt Tieger said that a creation of one of the game's bosses was \\"inspired by all the fun\\" that he had while playing the Metal Slug 2D shooter series with its \\"crazy bosses\\". O'Connor said the game's reputation system was inspired by the contrast between the Old West figures such as Billy the Kid and the likes of Wyatt Earp, who \\"both were feared gunslingers, but one was a psychopathic killer and the other was a good guy/lawman.\\" The developers licensed Ennio Morricone's main theme from the film The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly which was remixed to fit the horror feel of the game. The remaining music on the soundtrack is completely original, co-composed by Mike Reagan, a veteran film and game music composer, and Asdru Sierra, frontman for the Latin Grammy-winning indie band Ozomatli, who said: \\"Our goal is to help connect the audience with a conflicted character, one who alternates between moments of providence and misguidance, and accomplish that with a musical score of cinematic proportions.\\"Garnett Lee, Darkwatch Soundtrack Gets Award Winning Composers , 1UP.com, 12/21/2004. The game's title sequence animation was created by Kyle Cooper using a collage of computer graphics images and live-action footage.David Clayman, Darkwatch: An Interview with Kyle Cooper, IGN, July 25, 2005.

A Darkwatch music video to Good Charlotte's song \\"Predictable\\" was also featured in MTV2's Video Mods.Jeremy Dunham, Darkwatch Goes MTV2, IGN, June 25, 2005.

According to the review by Cheat Code Central, \\"just about every aspect of Darkwatch is cool. The environments are cool, the weapons are cool, the characters are cool and while the gameplay is not unique it's definitely one of the best first-person shooters on the Xbox and PS2. The controls alone are worth the price of admission.\\" John Scalzo of Gaming Target wrote that \\"for anyone looking for something a little different out of their FPS experience, Darkwatch is that game.\\"John Scalzo, Darkwatch, Gaming Target, February 02, 2006. The reviewer in GamePro wrote that Darkwatch \\"mixes its Western Roots with gothic horror and steampunk aesthetics, and the results are uniquely engaging,\\" adding that if some the game's \\"cooler\\" concepts \\"had been explored further, lengthening the game in the process, Darkwatch could've rivaled the best of the genre.\\" Official Xbox Magazine called it \\"a solid and robust blaster that's tons of fun.

It will leave gamers hungry for more.\\" According to Game Informer, \\"in terms of gameplay quality, this may be another middle-of-the-road shooter, but the unique premise sets it aside from everything else out there.\\" Greg Bemis of G4TV wrote that the biggest draw in Darkwatch is the \\"different enough\\" setting that \\"does fall back on tired video game clichés from time to time like big-breasted, leather-clad babes who speak in aggressive sexually suggestive double entendres, but it’s nice to see something--anything--that’s a little off the beaten path.\\" GameShark's Will Jayson Hill wrote that \\"about the sharpest criticism that can be leveled at Darkwatch is that it really adds nothing original in the gameplay department. Aside from its extremely well executed western/horror environment, Darkwatch is a pretty generic FPS game with a weaker multiplayer mode.\\"Will Jayson Hill, Darkwatch Review, GameShark, August 24, 2005. On the other hand, some reviews thought that the gameplay was actually the strongest part of the game.

Fast-paced with cool guns, what's not to like?\\"Official PlayStation 2 Magazine UK #98, November 2005, p.120. GameZone's Mike David wrote that only a \\"weak plot pacing and that feeling that something is missing\\" kept it from being given a score of 9/10. However, some of the reviews were more negative. PALGN's Jeremy Jastrzab opined that \\"Darkwatch gives vampires, undead, cowboys and plenty of bullets to fire. But that's about it. Otherwise, Darkwatch is a fairly standard affair that's worth a rental.\\" According to Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, \\"Darkwatch doesn't amount to much more than your run-of-the mill first-person shooter.\\"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine #96, September 2005, p.91. Eurogamer's Martin Coxall called it \\"a generic and quickly tiresome shooter, with a contrived premise which, unfortunately, does nothing to elevate it.\\" =Other reception= The game's characters, especially Tala, received some of the most notable reception.

He was also a Sinn Féin representative and member of the Gaelic League. In 2009 he was named in the Sunday Tribune's list of the 125 Most Influential People In GAA History. Early life Nowlan was born in Monasterevin, County Kildare in 1862 and is listed in the local church as being baptised at Cowpasture, Monasterevin on 25 May 1862. His father, Patrick Nowlan, was an early member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and friend of James Stephens. Patrick Nowlan was a cooper from Kilkenny city and possibly moved from there to work at Cassidy's Whiskey in Monasterevin. James Nowlan also trained as a cooper. Career Nowlan was a member of the Gaelic League, a lifelong supporter of the Irish language revival movement and a supporter of Sinn Féin from its foundation in 1905. In 1898 he was elected an alderman of Kilkenny Corporation. He used his time in this position to help promote the GAA, which had been set up 14 years prior and was a relatively new organisation at the time. In 1900 he became the first chairman of the Leinster Council of the GAA. He was elected President of the GAA nationally at the 1901 Congress held in September of that year. He would hold that position for twenty years - making him the longest serving president. During his time in office he attempted to steer the organisation on a more republican path. Following the Easter Rising, Nowlan was arrested by the British in May 1916 and interned without trial in Frongoch, Wales. In August of that year he was released and continued with his GAA and Sinn Féin duties. He publicly voiced support for the Irish Republican Army during the Anglo-Irish War in the 1920s. At the 1921 Congress, held in March of that year, Nowlan retired as GAA President, and was appointed Honorary Life President of the association -- the only person to be so honoured. Death and legacy Nowlan died in June 1924 in his mid-70s. Nowlan Park, the GAA stadium in his native Kilkenny, was renamed in his honour three years later. He was buried in Glasnevin cemetery. There was no headstone on his grave until 2013 when the GAA erected a Celtic cross. In September 2016 the GAA unveiled a new trophy named The James Nowlan Cup to be presented to the All-Ireland under-21 hurling champions.

It depicts an elderly musician, a blind, haggard man with threadbare clothing, weakly hunched over his guitar while playing in the streets of Barcelona, Spain. It is currently on display at the Art Institute of Chicago as part of the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection. At the time of The Old Guitarists creation, Modernism, Impressionism, Post- Impressionism, and Symbolism had greatly influenced Picasso's style. Furthermore, El Greco, Picasso's poor standard of living, and the suicide of a dear friend influenced Picasso's style at the time which came to be known as his Blue Period. Several x-rays, infrared images and examinations by curators revealed three different figures hidden behind the old guitarist. Blue Period At the time, having renounced his classical and traditional education and searching for fame, Picasso and his friend Carlos Casagemas moved to Paris. A year later, Casagemas became hopelessly miserable from a failed love affair and committed suicide. Picasso was greatly afflicted by this event and was soon depressed and desolate. In addition, Picasso was very poor. His poverty made him identify and relate to beggars, prostitutes and other downtrodden outcasts in society. These events and circumstances were the impetus for the beginning of Picasso's Blue Period which lasted from 1901 to 1904. The Blue Period is identified by the flat expanses of blues, greys and blacks, melancholy figures lost in contemplation, and a deep and significant tragedy. After the Blue Period came Picasso's Rose Period, and eventually the Cubism movement which Picasso co-founded. Analysis Elements in The Old Guitarist were carefully chosen to generate a reaction from the spectator. For example, the monochromatic color scheme creates flat, two-dimensional forms that dissociate the guitarist from time and place. In addition, the overall muted blue palette creates a general tone of melancholy and accentuates the tragic and sorrowful theme. The sole use of oil on panel causes a darker and more theatrical mood. Oil tends to blend the colors together without diminishing brightness, creating an even more cohesive dramatic composition. Furthermore, the guitarist, although muscular, shows little sign of life and appears to be close to death, implying little comfort in the world and accentuating the misery of his situation. Details are eliminated and scale is manipulated to create elongated and elegant proportions while intensifying the silent contemplation of the guitarist and a sense of spirituality. The large, brown guitar is the only significant shift in color found in the painting; its dull brown, prominent against the blue background, becomes the center and focus. The guitar comes to represent the guitarist's world and only hope for survival. This blind and poor subject depends on his guitar and the small income he can earn from his music for survival. Some art historians believe this painting expresses the solitary life of an artist and the natural struggles that come with the career. Therefore, music, or art, becomes a burden and an alienating force that isolates artists from the world.Blue Period Music: The Old Guitarist And yet, despite the isolation, the guitarist (artist) depends on the rest of society for survival. All of these emotions reflect Picasso's predicament at the time and his criticism of the state of society. The Old Guitarist becomes an allegory of human existence. Paul Mariani, a biographer of Wallace Stevens, presented his analysis of the painting as a counterpoint to objections raised by Stevens concerning the origin of his own poem titled The Man With the Blue Guitar stating, > \\"Despite his repeatedly denying it, Stevens does seem to have a particular > painting in mind here: Picasso's 1903 The Old Guitarist, which portrays an > old man with white hair and beard sitting distorted and cross-legged as he > plays his guitar. If Picasso attempted to portray the world of poverty and > abject misery, it was because that had been his own plight as a struggling > young artist in Barcelona, where he painted many pictures including this > one, of the poor. The painting is almost entirely done in monochromatic > blues and blue-blacks, except for the guitar itself, which is painted in a > slightly warmer brown. The man is blind but, no longer seeing the world > around him, he sees more deeply into the reality within.\\"Paul Mariani. > Biography of Wallace Stevens. Page 226. In the Old Guitarist, Picasso may have drawn upon George Frederic Watts's painting of Hope (1886), which similarly depicts a hunched, helpless musician with a distorted angular form and predominantly blue tone. Infrared discoveries Detail showing an image beneath Recent x-rays and examinations by curators found three figures peering behind the old guitarist's body. The three figures are an old woman with her head bent forward, a young mother with a small child kneeling by her side, and an animal on the right side of the canvas. Despite unclear imagery in crucial areas of the canvas, experts determined that at least two different paintings are found beneath The Old Guitarist. In 1998, researchers used an infrared camera to penetrate the uppermost layer of paint (the composition of The Old Guitarist) and clearly saw the second-most composition. By using this camera, researchers were able to discover a young mother seated in the center of the composition, reaching out with her left arm to her kneeling child at her right, and a calf or sheep on the mother's left side. Clearly defined, the young woman has long, flowing dark hair and a thoughtful expression. The Art Institute of Chicago shared its infrared images with the Cleveland Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., where curator William Robinson identified a sketch by Picasso sent to his friend Max Jacob in a letter. It revealed the same composition of mother and child, but it had a cow licking the head of a small calf. In a letter to Jacob, Picasso reveals he was painting this composition a few months before he began The Old Guitarist. Despite these discoveries, the reason Picasso did not complete the composition with a mother and child, and how the older woman fitted into the history of the canvas, remain unknown. In 2019, researchers at University College London used neural network to recreate the painting found by infrared camera. The neural network was trained to recreate the painting from other works of Picasso during his Blue Period. Anthony Bourached, George Cann \\"Raiders of the Lost Art\\", arXiv, 2019 In popular culture As one of Picasso's more notable Blue Period works, The Old Guitarist has influenced other artists of all backgrounds. For example, Paul McCartney drew from the painting when creating a chord progression.https://news.artnet.com/art-world/kanye-west-paul-mccartney-andy- warhol-603908 This progression and McCartney's accompanying melody were his contributions to the Kanye West song \\"All Day\\".

DataTAC was also marketed in the mid-1990s as MobileData by Telecom Australia, and is still used by Bell Mobility as a paging network in Canada. The first public open and mobile data network using MDI DataTAC was found in Hong Kong as Hutchison Mobile Data Limited (a subsidiary of Hutchison Telecom) where public end-to-end data services are provided for enterprises, FedEx, and consumer mobile information services were also offered called MobileQuotes with financial information, news, telebetting and stock data. DataTAC is an open standard for point to point wireless data communications, similar to Mobitex. Like Mobitex, it is mainly used in vertical market applications. One of the early DataTAC devices was the Newton Messaging Card, a two-way pager connected to a PC card using the DataTAC network. The original BlackBerry devices, the RIM 850 and 857 also used the DataTAC network. In North America, DataTAC is typically deployed in the 800 MHz band. DataTAC was also deployed in the same band by Telecom Australia (now Telstra). The DataTAC network runs at speeds up to 19.2 kbit/s, which is not sufficient to handle most of the wireless data applications available today. The network runs 25 kHz channels in the 800 MHz frequency bands. Due to the lower frequency bands that DataTAC uses, in-building coverage is typically better than with newer, higher frequency networks.

U.S. Highways and Interstate Highways are included in the system; the only overlaps are with the end-to-end U.S. Route 3 and Route 3 and the far-apart Interstate 295, shared with Rhode Island, and Route 295, shared with New York State. A state highway in Massachusetts is a road maintained by the state, which may or may not have a number. Not all numbered routes are maintained or owned by the state. History The Massachusetts Highway Commission (MHC) was the first highway commission in the U.S., formed in 1893 in response to a commission of inquiry finding that over 90% of the public roads in the state were in poor condition.Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles, History of the Massachusetts License Plate. . The first state highway in Massachusetts was a 5305.17-foot (1617.02 m) section of Fitchburg Road (now Main Street, part of Route 119) in Ashby. The MHC laid it out as a state highway on August 15, 1894 from a point west of South Road to a point west of Route 31. The road was paved with 15–20 foot (4.5–6 m) macadam, with work beginning August 21, 1894 and ending July 15, 1895. The 50–66 foot (15–20 m) right-of-way is still owned by MassDOT under the original layout.MassDOT state highway layout plan 1 (August 15, 1894). .MassDOT state highway layout plans: About page. . Massachusetts first gained numbered routes in 1922, with the formation of the New England Interstate Highways. Three-digit numbers were reserved for shorter routes. Route 138 and Route 140 were designated by 1925, and by 1926 the numbers from Route 101 to Route 142 (except Route 136) had been assigned. The establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926 resulted in several of the New England Interstate routes having to be renumbered. The New England Interstate routes that conflicted with new U.S. Highway numbers were assigned newly freed single-digit numbers. Beginning in 1929, local routes were assigned new two-digit numbers. With the exception of Route 143, which was renumbered from Route 109A ca. 1933, new routes were given two-digit numbers for a while. Larger three-digit numbers were eventually assigned. Over the years, most of the state's highways have been maintained by a varied list of agencies, including the Massachusetts Highway Department, Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, and the Massachusetts Port Authority, but are now maintained by the consolidated MassDOT. The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation's Bureau of Engineering still manages and/or operates a number of parkways across the Commonwealth. All routes that end at a state border and continue as a numbered route on the other side have been renumbered on one side of the border to match. Except for Route 295, far from Interstate 295, numbers that were duplicated with Interstate Highways were renumbered, mostly in 1959 when the Interstate numbers were assigned. *The longest numbered highway in the state is U.S. Route 20, which runs for . *The longest state highway is Route 28, which runs for . *The longest Interstate highway in Massachusetts is Interstate 90 (the Mass Pike), which runs . *The shortest route in Massachusetts is Route 15, which runs for only . The shortest signed highway is Route 108, which runs for . Both are short extensions of state highways in neighboring states. The shortest route completely within state borders is Route 240, which runs for . *The shortest Interstate in Massachusetts is Interstate 295, which runs as a extension of I-295 in Rhode Island. There are no state or federal highways of any kind in the island counties, Nantucket or Dukes. There are eight mainland towns which have no state or federal highway routes: Mount Washington and Tyringham in Berkshire County, Hampden in Hampden County, Middlefield in Hampshire County, Leyden, Monroe and Rowe in Franklin County, and Nahant in Essex County. Other than Nahant, which is a peninsula town just south of the city of Lynn, the towns are mostly isolated rural communities in the western half of the state. Additionally, there are seven other towns which do not have any Massachusetts state highways: Chester, Holland, Mattapoisett, Montgomery, New Ashford, Shutesbury and Wilbraham. Wellfleet does not have any signed state highways but includes the silent concurrency of Route 6A with U.S. Route 6. Several other towns have less than a mile of state highway. Signage practices Shields for Interstate 93, U.S. 1 and Route 3 =State routes= Massachusetts uses a simple design for its state route shields. Black numerals are displayed on a plain white shield, usually with a black border near the edge of the sign, although this differs from sign to sign, especially on highway overheads. Single- and double-digit state highway numbers are posted on standard square sign panels, while three-digit (and three- and four-character alternate such as 28A) numbers are displayed on elongated panels. State route shields on freeways, such as Route 24 and Route 128 have the same design, but are usually much larger in size for easier viewing at highway speeds. =U.S. Routes= Massachusetts uses the standard white-shield on black background design for its U.S. Routes, used in all states except for California. Signs for U.S. Routes on green highway signs generally omit the black background, but some older signs still have them. A number of signs installed on the U.S. Route 3 expressway are of a cut-out design, without the black background. U.S. Routes on freeways usually have extra-large sign panels posted. NOTE: Alternates of U.S. routes in Massachusetts are signed as state highways (Routes 1A, 3A (northern), 6A, 7A, and 20A). =Interstate Highways= Massachusetts uses standard Interstate highway shields without the state name on the shield, although a small number of very old signs do exist with the state name. Interstate shields are usually of the extra-large variety, with the exception of the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90), which uses standard shields. =Auxiliary routes= UK \\"Worboys\\" style road sign in Boston showing former C routes Massachusetts does not use auxiliary tabs for route signage, and as such contains no bypass or business routes. Massachusetts formerly had \\"city routes\\", which were signed C1, C9, C28, and C37, as city alignments of the respective state routes. All of these designations were decommissioned in the early 1970s. Since then, no route in Massachusetts has ever had more than one alternate, save for multiple sections of a single numbered route such as 1A, 2A or 3A. (a Route 3B existed in the 1920s but was renumbered to Route 38). The Lowell Connector was technically the only \\"auxiliary\\" route in the state, having been formerly signed as Interstate 495 Business Spur in the 1960s. =Exit numbering= Massachusetts is one of the few U.S. states that still uses sequential exit numbering on its freeways. The state amendments to the 2009 national MUTCD, published in January 2012, stated that Massachusetts would be changing all exit numbers to the mileage-based system \\"within the next five to ten years\\". This change was supposed to be made starting in 2016 when a project to renumber all currently numbered exits to those based on highway mileposts was to start. This project, though, was indefinitely postponed in the middle of 2016 until on November 18, 2019 the MassDot confirmed that beginning in late summer 2020 the exit renumbering project will begin. Exit numbers are posted on all of its Interstate Highways, as well as other major freeways in the state, including the freeway portions of Route 2, the Pilgrims Highway (part of Route 3), the Northwest Expressway (part of US 3), Route 24, Route 25, Route 128, the southern portion of Route 140, Route 213, and most recently, Route 146. Five freeways in Massachusetts contain irregular exit numbering patterns: *On Route 2, exit numbers start at 14 and increase to 43, with a gap in the freeway between Acton and Lexington. Exit numbering resumes at 52 and ends at 60. *The Northwest Expressway (US 3) is the one freeway in Massachusetts that still uses the \\"25 is 128\\" system. As such, its exit numbering scheme starts at 25 (at Route 128/I-95) and goes up to 36. *Route 128 has reversed exit numbering; that is, exit numbers increase going north-to-south. Exit numbers start at 29 and end at 10. There are no exits 1-9, there is no exit 11, and exit 27 was removed. Route 128 has always had this system; however most of its exit numbering was replaced by the standard south-to-north of I-93 and I-95 south of Peabody. *I-93 in Boston has gone under many exit numbering changes since the Big Dig project was completed, and many old interchanges were closed or reconfigured. Numbering on the Interstate goes from 1 to 48, but the following exit numbers no longer exist: 17, 19, 21, 22, and 25. *Numbering on the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) increases from 1 to 26; however, exits 11 and 11A are almost 10 miles apart, exits 14 and 15 are the same exit, exit 15B is a westbound only off ramp, exits 18 and 20 are the same exit, exit 19 was a mainline toll plaza until 2016, and exits 21 and 23 are westbound on-ramps only. =Signage errors= Noncodified design used in error on Massachusetts state highway signage Massachusetts is rather notorious for the placement of incorrect signage along its numbered highways. Some older, erroneous signs for state routes show numbers in a white circle rather than rounded square, with black on the outside; although not codified, a number of examples of this design remain extant. Some of these errors are due to outdated signage which have not been replaced since a realignment or truncation of a route, which can lead to confusion as to where a particular route goes. Lack of route signage in urban areas is a common problem. One very common signage error, which occurs in many states, is the mis-signage of a U.S. Highway as a state route (mostly on guide signs). This occurs in many places along U.S. Route 202, as well as on sections of U.S. Route 20 and in a few spots along U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 44. These are less confusing sign errors, as U.S. Routes are part of the Massachusetts State Highway System, and thus do not share numbers with other state routes (the one exception being U.S./MA Route 3, which connect end-to-end and are treated as the same route by the state). Near Route 126 in Bellingham, Elm Street has a US 126 sign. A more unusual signage error occurred at the intersection of Route 10 and Route 141 in Easthampton in July 2005, in which Alabama state route markers were installed for the two routes. This error came from a contractor who mistakenly signed the route based on the design in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices that showed an Alabama route marker.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 86. History It was founded in 18th century colonial times and was initially called \\"Opessa's Town\\" or \\"Shawanese Old Town\\" because it was the site of a Shawnee Amerindian village abandoned about a decade earlier. In later years the explanatory prefix was dropped from the name and the place because known simply as \\"Oldtown\\". Oldtown was begun (on a soon to be busy road) with the building of a trading post along an old Native American trail, the Nemacolin Trail, as traders, especially fur traders (and trappers) pushed through the Cumberland Narrows mountain pass into the Monongahela River valley. In 1741 Thomas Cresap established a trading post at the abandoned village. A few years earlier, Cresap had figured prominently in the Conejohela War, (also called Cresap's War) concerning the Conejohela Flats area of the Susquehanna River valley, later York County, Pennsylvania. Shortly after his release from prison in Pennsylvania for advocating Maryland's claims, Cresap moved west to the sparsely settled frontier. Lord Baltimore claimed lands at the headwaters of the Potomac River. The move positioned Cresap and his patron to open the as yet uncharted Ohio Country. Cresap and the Delaware chief Nemacolin opened a road westward under the auspices of the Virginia and Maryland speculators of the Ohio Company once they received a charter. Cresap's son Michael Cresap was born at Oldtown, the first white male born in Allegany County. A post office was established there on May 26, 1870. Oldtown is connected by a one-lane low- water toll bridge to Green Spring in Hampshire County, West Virginia. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal reached Cumberland, Maryland, from Georgetown (Washington, D.C.) in 1850, passing Oldtown at milepost 166.5. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, located just across the Potomac from Oldtown, had reached Cumberland eight years earlier. The canal finally closed operations as a carrier in 1924 due to flood damage. The B&O; Railroad, now CSX, continues to be a major carrier, and it is used daily by Amtrak's Capitol Limited between Washington, DC and Chicago. The Western Maryland Railway was extended west from Big Pool, Maryland, to Cumberland as a Class-I railroad in 1906, with the mainline being constructed through Oldtown complete with a train station located at the lower end of town. Passenger service ended on the Western Maryland Railway between Cumberland and Hagerstown on May 30, 1953. Afterwards it was not uncommon for B&O; passenger trains to be rerouted over the Western Maryland through Oldtown. The last scheduled WM trains through Oldtown occurred on May 12, 1975, for freight, and May 21, 1975, for a Chessie System Passenger Special. The line was officially abandoned as part of the \\"Chessie System\\" consolidation, and all WM trains began running on the nearby B&O.; A Chessie System work train pulled up the rails through Oldtown in June 1976. In 1924 a six-classroom/auditorium brick school was erected along Main Street, with the first class graduating from there in 1925. In 1939 an identical new high school section was added to the south end of the present school, which increased the classroom total to fourteen. It included a new cafeteria, office and faculty room. During the 1954-55 school year yet another high school section was added, along with a new vocational agricultural shop, a furnace room and a brand new combination gym/auditorium which could seat 900 people. During the summer of 1977, the 1925 and 1939 sections were torn down, and a new present-day first floor section was constructed on the east side of where the old sections stood. In 2000 the 76th and final class graduated from Oldtown High School, and the school closed. Today it is privately owned, and a restaurant is now located in the former school cafeteria. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The Michael Cresap House was listed in 1972 and the Shawnee Old Fields Village Site in 1975.

They are large flies with large brightly-coloured compound eyes, and large clear wings with dark bands. They are larger than the common housefly and smaller than the horse-fly. There are 250 species of deer fly in the genus Chrysops. Their distribution is worldwide, though they have not been reported in Iceland, Greenland, and Hawaii. Deer flies lay between 100 and 800 eggs in batches on vegetation near water or dampness. During the larval stage, which lasts one to three years, they feed on small creatures or rotting organic matter near or in the water. After a pupal stage, they emerge as adults in late spring and summer. While male deer flies collect pollen, female deer flies feed on blood, which they require to produce eggs. Females feed primarily on mammals. They are attracted to prey by sight, smell, or the detection of carbon dioxide. Other attractants are body heat, movement, dark colours, and lights in the night. They are active under direct sunshine and hours when the temperature is above 22 °C (71.6°). When feeding, the females use scissor-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision and then lap up the blood. Their bite can be painful. Anti-coagulants in the saliva of the fly prevents blood from clotting and may cause severe allergic reactions. Parasites and diseases transmitted by the deer fly include tularemia, anthrax, anaplasmosis, equine infectious anemia, hog cholera, and filiariasis. DEET is not an effective repellent. Predators of the deer fly (and other Tabanidae) include nest-building wasps and hornets, dragonflies, and some birds including the killdeer. They cannot be controlled by humans because insecticides cannot be applied in the sensitive wetlands where the larvae typically develop. Additionally, adults may have developed a significant distance from where the eggs were laid. Trapping devices and protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts and hats, can help avoid the annoyance and bites of aggressive deer flies.

Murphy joined the team during the 1942 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1951 championship. During that time he won four All-Ireland medals, five Munster medals and one National League medal. Murphy was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Murphy had a lengthy career with Valley Rovers while he also played with divisional side Carrigdhoun. In retirement from playing Murphy became a referee at the highest levels. He also served as a Gaelic games administrator with the Cork County Board before assuming the office of President of the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1976. Playing career =Colleges= Murphy first tasted success on the hurling field during his studies at the North Monastery in Cork. By 1940 he had joined the college's senior hurling team and won a Dr. Harty Cup medal that year following a defeat of Limerick CBS. It was the first of three successive Munster medals for Murphy. =Club= Murphy was still a juvenile when he joined the Valley Rovers top hurling and football teams. In 1937 the Valley Rovers club had a 4–3 to 2–0 win over Carrigaline and a 1–1 to 0–2 win over Kinsale, yielding Murphy junior divisional hurling and football medals respectively. Four years later in 1941 Murphy won a second divisional junior hurling medal as Valley Rovers defeated Tracton by 5–7 to 5–3. Two years later he won a second divisional junior football medal following a defeat of the same opposition. In 1945 Murphy was a member of the Carrigdhoun divisional team that reached the final of the senior hurling championship. Glen Rovers bested Murphy's side by 4–10 to 5–3. The twilight of Murphy's career brought further success at divisional level. He won a third divisional junior hurling medal in 1949. He also added two more divisional junior football medals to his collection in 1947 and 1951. =Inter-county= Murphy joined the Cork senior hurling team at a time of great success. He made his senior championship debut in 1942 and collected his first Munster medal as Tipperary were downed by 4–15 to 4–1. The All-Ireland final was a replay of the previous year with Dublin providing the opposition once again. The game was a close affair with just a point separating the sides at the three-quarter stage. In the end Cork won by 2–14 to 3–4 and Murphy collected an All-Ireland medal. A 2–13 to 3–8 defeat of Waterford in 1943 gave Murphy a second Munster medal. He later lined out in a second All-Ireland decider with Antrim becoming the first Ulster side to qualify for a final. A final score of 5–16 to 0–4 gave Cork their second-ever hat-trick of All-Ireland titles while it also gave Murphy a second All-Ireland medal. In 1944 Cork were attempting to capture a fourth All-Ireland title in-a-row. No team in the history of the hurling championship had won more than three consecutive titles. The year got off to a good start when Cork defeated Limerick by 4–6 to 3–6 after a replay to give Murphy a third Munster medal. For the third time in four years Cork faced Dublin in an All-Ireland decider. Joe Kelly was the hero of the day and he contributed greatly to Cork's 2–13 to 1–2 victory. It was a third successive All-Ireland medal for Murphy. Five-in-a-row proved to be a bridge too far for Cork, however, the team returned in 1946. A 3–8 to 1–3 defeat of Limerick gave Murphy his fourth Munster medal. Under the captaincy of Christy Ring, Cork subsequently faced old rivals Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final. While some had written off Cork's chances, they took an interval lead of four points. With ten minutes remaining Cork's lead was reduced to just two points, however, goals by Mossy O'Riordan and Joe Kelly secured the victory. A 7–6 to 3–8 score line gave Murphy a fourth and final All-Ireland medal. Cork retained their provincial dominance in 1947 with Murphy picking up a fifth winners' medal following a three-point victory over Limerick. The All-Ireland final was a repeat of the previous year with Kilkenny providing the opposition. The stakes were high for both sides as Cork were aiming for a record sixth championship in seven seasons while Kilkenny were aiming to avoid becoming the first team to lose three consecutive All-Ireland finals. In what has been described as one of the greatest deciders of all-time, little separated the two teams over the course if the hour. A Joe Kelly goal put Cork one point ahead with time almost up, however, Terry Leahy proved to be the hero of the day. He converted a free to level the sides again before sending over the match-winner from the subsequent puck-out. With that the game was over and Murphy's side were beaten by 0–14 to 2–7. It was the fifth time that Kilkenny had pipped Cork by a single point in an All-Ireland final. Murphy won a National Hurling League medal at the start of 1948 following a 3–3 to 1–2 defeat of Tipperary. Cork later faced an on-point defeat by Waterford in the provincial decider. That defeat saw the break-up of the great four-in-a-row team of the 1940s and was followed by four lean years of championship hurling for Cork. Three consecutive defeats by Tipperary in 1949, 1950 and 1951 proved too much and Murphy retired from inter-county hurling in 1951. =Inter- provincial= Murphy was selected for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He made his debut with the province in 1944 and was a regular until his retirement in 1950. Murphy's first Railway Cup medal was secured as an unused substitute in 1944 when Munster defeated Connacht by 4–10 to 4–4. Four years later in 1948 Murphy was a member of the starting fifteen as Munster returned to the final. A 3–5 to 2–5 defeat of Leinster gave Murphy his second Railway Cup medal, his first on the field of play. It was the first of three- in-a-row for Munster as subsequent defeats of Connacht and Leinster brought Murphy's medal tally to four. Post playing career =Refereeing career= As his playing career drew to a close Murphy began his career as a referee. He was still a player with the Cork senior team when he was charged with officiating at the National League final in 1947. The following year Murphy took charge of his first All-Ireland senior decider when Waterford won their inaugural title. 1949 saw him referee the Munster final, having played in the earlier rounds of the championship, as well as the All-Ireland junior final. The following year Murphy was the man-in-the-middle for the All-Ireland senior final once again as Tipperary took their second consecutive title. In 1952 he was the referee for the National League final once again. Murphy was also a popular referee on the local club scene around Munster. He took charge of numerous club championship deciders in Cork and Tipperary. =Cork County Board= Murphy was still a teenager when he became involved in the administrative affairs of the Gaelic Athletic Association. He represented Valley Rovers at the Carrigdhoun convention and in 1948 was elected chairman of that body at just twenty-six years of age. Murphy went on to represent Carrigdhoun at county board level, and became a member of the Cork County Board executive in 1947. In the early 1950s Murphy held the positions of vice- chairman and Treasurer. In 1956, following the death of Seán Óg Murphy, he took over as Secretary of the County Board. He held this position until 1973. In the mid-1980s Murphy returned as Chairman of the Cork County Board. In 2005 Murphy was a delegate at the GAA's annual congress when the controversial Rule 42 was debated. Murphy was one of the most vocal opponents and campaigned to keep Croke Park closed to soccer and rugby. =President of the GAA= In 1976 Murphy became President of the Gaelic Athletic Association, a role which he held until 1978. During his three-year term as President there were many significant developments, such as the official opening of the 50,000-seat Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork in 1976, which he played a big part in the construction of. He also campaigned to the British government on the behalf of Crossmaglen Rangers, whose pitch had been occupied by the British army. During his tenure as President Murphy also had the privilege of presenting the Liam MacCarthy Cup to three different Cork men in succession as Cork completed a famous three-in-a-row of All-Ireland hurling victories. Personal life Born in Toureen, a few miles on the Cork side of Innishannon, Murphy was the eldest of seven children, four boys and three girls. From an early age he took a great interest in Gaelic games, particularly since his uncle Seán McCarthy, his mother's brother, was GAA president from 1932 to 1935. Murphy was educated at the local national school and later attended the North Monastery in Cork. He later joined the Southern Health Board and served in various grades and positions until he retired from the position of Senior Executive Officer in 1983. After this he started a private business which he operated very successfully until his retirement in 1998. Murphy was also named as a member of the RTÉ Authority and in 1995 he was made a Freeman of the City of Cork. Murphy died at St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork on 29 April 2007.

The historic houses contain the collections and treasures of Philip Rosenbach and his younger brother Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach. The brothers owned the Rosenbach Company which became the preeminent dealer of rare books, manuscripts and decorative arts during the first half of the 20th century. Dr. Rosenbach in particular was seminal in the rare book world, helping to build libraries such as the Widener Library at Harvard, The Huntington Library and the Folger Shakespeare Library. In 2013, the Rosenbach became a subsidiary of the Free Library of Philadelphia Foundation, but maintains its own board and operates independently of the public library system. The Rosenbach documents a panorama of American and European culture through its vast historical, literary and artistic treasures. State historical marker Rosenbach State Historical Marker. On April 2, 2008, the Rosenbach received an official State Historical Marker by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in recognition of the lasting contributions of museum co-founder, Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach. The commission commemorated Dr. Rosenbach's legacy as one of America's greatest rare book dealers and his lasting contributions to Philadelphia and beyond with a marker in front of the museum, located at 2008-2010 Delancey Place Delancey Place (Philadelphia) in the city's historic Rittenhouse Square neighborhood. The sign reads: > \\"Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach (1876–1952) Among America's most influential rare book > dealers, he helped build many of the nation's great libraries. He and his > brother Philip established the Rosenbach to share their personal collection > with the public. They lived on this block from 1926 to 1952.\\" Decorative arts collections The greater part of the house is furnished much as the Rosenbach brothers lived in it. The furniture is mainly 18th- century English with notable examples of the work of Chippendale, Vile, Adam, Hepplewhite and Sheraton. Other important pieces include an olivewood box with bronze doré mounts made for Charles II, an American recamier sofa with carving attributed to Samuel McIntire and a major Philadelphia highboy. A comprehensive collection of English silver and gold from the 17th and mid-18th centuries includes masterworks by Paul Storr, Hester Bateman and a choice group of items made for the British royal family. Over one thousand portrait miniatures are included in the collection, including one by Nicholas Hilliard of James I. Choice collections of 18th century porcelain, glass, paintings, drawings and sculpture are drawn upon to complete the furnishings. The adjacent building, 2008 Delancey Place, was purchased by the foundation in January 1993 and allowed the museum to expand its facilities and exhibition space. Rare books and manuscripts from the Americana Collection The Americana collection begins with accounts of early voyages and tales of exploration, which includes a copy of Antonio Pigafetta's account of Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigation of the globe and rare tracts relating to the settlement of Virginia. The books are complemented, as is every other aspect of the collection, by manuscript material. This includes letters of Cortés, Pizarro and de Soto, including the 1532 letters of Cortés to the Council of the Indies seeking permission to form an expedition to explore the coast of California. The period of colonial settlement is well represented by early accounts and important religious tracts, particularly those relating to the various missions of the Indians, as well as a collection of Indian Captivity Tales. The first three extant books printed in the western hemisphere are present in the Rosenbach's collections—Mexico 1543–44, Lima 1584–85, and the legendary Bay Psalm Book, the first book printed in what is now the United States (Cambridge, Massachusetts 1661). The American Revolution is documented with over one hundred letters written by George Washington, the original manuscript resolution of the Continental Congress, a superb collection of documents by signers of the Declaration of Independence, Commodore Barry's ship papers, which outline the beginnings of the American navy, and a set of Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanacs, including the only known surviving copy of the 1733 first edition, first printing. The period of western expansion is represented by early diaries and traveler's accounts, printed pocket guides and histories. Of particular importance is the material dealing with the Pacific Northwest, including diaries of the Oregon pioneers and the document signed by Andrew Johnson authorizing Seward to negotiate for the purchase of Alaska. Material from the Civil War is extensive. It consists of more than two hundred letters of Abraham Lincoln, one hundred and fifty war letters of Ulysses S. Grant, two of Robert E. Lee letters and the original Resolution signed by both houses of the United States Congress proposing the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery. Irish, British and American literature Chronologically this collection begins with a fine group of English literary manuscripts from the 15th century including Thomas Hoccleve's poems (1410) which contain a celebrated portrait of Chaucer. There is a major manuscript of the Canterbury Tales and a noble fragment of another illustrated version. A small and equally choice collection of books of the pre-Elizabethan and Elizabethan period is complemented by a collection of commonplace books. There is an extremely rare first edition of Pilgrim's Progress which was first owned by one of Bunyan's acquaintances from debtors' prison. The majority of major British authors from the 18th century are represented by first editions of their more important works, and many of them by manuscript material as well. Some highlights are; Tonson's assignment copy of Milton's Paradise Lost, a group of Thomas Gray's letters, five leaves of the manuscript of James Boswell's Life of Johnson and the most extensive collection of Robert Burns manuscripts in existence. As you enter into the 19th and 20th centuries the collection strengthens. There are manuscripts of Walter Scott, William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, Shelley and Keats (including a celebrated love letter to Fanny Brawne) and the only surviving fragment of Fitzgerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. The Rosenbach also has a supreme Dickens collection extending from the earliest extant manuscript to a carte- de-viste photo signed on the day before his death. The collection also includes Dickens' manuscripts of Nicholas Nickleby and the Pickwick Papers. Lewis Carroll is represented by over six hundred letters, early drawings, presentation books, photographs and his own first-edition copy of Alice in Wonderland. Other manuscripts include the work of Oscar Wilde, Aubrey Beardsley, Conan Doyle, Joseph Conrad and Dylan Thomas Recreation of Marianne Moore's living room at Rosenbach. One of the Museum's most valuable items is the handwritten manuscript of James Joyce's Ulysses. In honor of the work, the Museum hosts a Bloomsday celebration every year, including readings from excerpts of the book. Also included at the Rosenbach is recreation of Marianne Moore's living room just as she lived in it. It was in this room that she lived and worked for more than forty years. Moore's complete library, with many personally inscribed and annotated books from her friends and contemporaries including Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot and Elizabeth Bishop, is part of the Rosenbach collections as well as all of her correspondence and drafts of her poetry and unpublished memoirs. Maurice Sendak Collection Famed author and illustrator Maurice Sendak chose the Rosenbach to be the repository for his work in 1968-2014 thanks to shared literary and collecting interests. Sendak is the author and illustrator of Where the Wild Things Are and 108 other books. His collection of nearly 10,000 works of art, manuscripts, books and ephemera, has been the subject of many exhibitions at the Rosenbach and has been enjoyed by visitors of all ages. One of the most famous creators of contemporary children's books, Sendak's work has challenged the norms of children's literature over time and continues to entrance both children and adults to this day. His innovative techniques and honest portrayal of childhood emotion are celebrated worldwide and have earned him several prestigious honors, including the Caldecott Book Medal (1964), the international Hans Christian Andersen Medal (1970), the National Medal of Arts (1996), a Library of Congress \\"Living Legend\\" medal (2000), and the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award for Literature (2003). The Rosenbach presented There's a Mystery There: Sendak on Sendak from May 6, 2008 through May 3, 2009. This major retrospective of over 130 pieces pulled from the museum's vast Sendak collection – the biggest collection of \\"Sendakiana\\" in the world – was the largest and most ambitious exhibition of Sendak's work ever created and featured original artwork, rare sketches, never-before-seen working materials and exclusive interview footage. The exhibition drew on a total of over 300 objects, with new works on display every four months, providing a unique experience with each set of illustrations. His personal works were returned to his estate in 2014 and are now in the care of the Sendak Foundation. The Rosenbach is home to his rare book collection, which includes rare books by Herman Melville, Beatrix Potter, William Blake, and pop-up books by Lothar Meggendorfer.

Upon his return to America, he became manager of Boston's Castle Square Theatre. In 1908, he was appointed as the managing director of the New Theatre, at Central Park West and 62nd Street in New York. In November 1909, the theatre opened officially to the public with an opulent production of Antony and Cleopatra starring Julia Marlowe and E. H. Sothern. The New Theatre was the largest playhouse in New York City at that time, and Ames began to mount ambitious productions, ranging from Shakespeare and other classics to modern works. The theatre was a financial failure and closed after only two seasons. In 1912, bucking the tide of Broadway commercialism, Ames used his own money to build the Little Theatre at 240 West 44th Street with the express idea of putting on experimental dramas and to give an opportunity to new playwrights. This theatre had 300 seats and was, at the time, the smallest legitimate theatre in New York. One of the plays he presented in October of the first year of operation was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which he billed as the \\"First play written entirely for the enjoyment of children.\\" Ames wrote the play under the pseudonym \\"Jessie Graham White\\" from the stories of the Brothers Grimm. The play received favorable reviews. He also built the Booth Theatre on West 45th Street in 1913 and managed both the Little Theatre and the Booth until 1930. Ames's most notable Broadway productions included an adaptation of Prunella (1913), The Philanderer (1913), A Pair of Silk Stockings (1914), and Pierrot the Prodigal (1916). During World War I, Ames organized the Over There Theatre League, which arranged for actors to travel to Europe to entertain troops. =Later years= Katharine Cornell in Ames' production of Will Shakespeare (1923) After the war, Ames began to direct most of the Broadway shows that he produced, including The Betrothal (1918), The Green Goddess (1921), The Truth About Blayds (1922), Will Shakespeare (1923), Beggar on Horseback (1924), Minick (1924), Old English (1924), White Wings (1926), Escape (1927), The Merchant of Venice (1928) and Mrs. Moonlight (1930). By the 1920s, after the extraordinary success of the Gilbert and Sullivan works in America at the end of the nineteenth century, the popularity of Gilbert and Sullivan had waned. Ames revived interest in these comic operas with lavish and lively seasons of Iolanthe, The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado from 1926 to 1929. Ames directed the productions himself at the Booth Theatre, which received critical praise.Hurley, G. M. \\"Gilbert and Sullivan – And Winthrop Ames,\\" The New Yorker, June 6, 1931, p. 70 These paved the way for American tours by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in the 1930s. TIME magazine wrote of Ames' production of Iolanthe: \\"It is generally agreed that in this entertainment he has done the best job of any producer attempting one of the famous series in our time. The only anxiety now is that he may be distracted before he has revived everyone of the operas in an equally felicitous vein.... The show is now accepted as incomparably the finest musical preparation of its type in town, and probably in the world.\\"New Plays\\", TIME magazine, May 03, 1926 In the 1920s, Ames began leasing his theatres to other producers, and he produced his last Broadway play in 1930. In 1931, as he wound down his business affairs with age and poor health, he sold the Little Theatre building to The New York Times. In 1959, the theatre was converted back to a theatre and was briefly renamed in 1964 as the \\"Winthrop Ames Theatre\\", and in 1983 it was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. In 1932, Ames left New York to retire to North Easton, but there he helped to found the Cambridge School of Drama. In 1929, he was elected a trustee of Harvard and in 1936 became vice president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. In addition to writing his children's adaptation of Snow White in 1913, Ames was commissioned by the Famous Players- Lasky Corporation to write the screenplay for their 1916 motion pictures Oliver Twist and Snow White.Winthrop Ames at the IMDB database He also translated The Merchant of Paris from the French in 1930 and wrote other plays. Ames died of pneumonia in 1937 in Boston three weeks before his 67th birthday and was buried in North Easton.Massachusetts, Death Index, 1901-1980, database (https://www.ancestry.com/ : accessed 23 Jan 2020) Department of Public Health, Registry of Vital Records and Statistics.

The mitral valve is the \\"inflow valve\\" for the left side of the heart. Blood flows from the lungs, where it picks up oxygen, through the pulmonary veins, to the left atrium of the heart. After the left atrium fills with blood, the mitral valve allows blood to flow from the left atrium into the heart's main pumping chamber called the left ventricle. It then closes to keep blood from leaking back into the left atrium or lungs when the ventricle contracts (squeezes) to push blood out to the body. It has two flaps, or leaflets, known as cusps. The techniques of mitral valve repair include inserting a cloth-covered ring around the valve to bring the leaflets into contact with each other (annuloplasty), removal of redundant/loose segments of the leaflets (quadrangular resection), and re-suspension of the leaflets with artificial (Gore-Tex) cords. Procedures on the mitral valve usually require a median sternotomy, but advances in non-invasive methods (such as keyhole surgery) allow surgery without a sternotomy (and resulting pain and scar). Minimally invasive mitral valve surgery is much more technically demanding and may involve higher risk. Occasionally, the mitral valve is abnormal from birth (congenital). More often the mitral valve becomes abnormal with age (degenerative) or as a result of rheumatic fever. In rare instances the mitral valve can be destroyed by infection or a bacterial endocarditis. Mitral regurgitation may also occur as a result of ischemic heart disease (coronary artery disease) or non-ischemic heart disease (dilated cardiomyopathy).  History  In 1923 Dr. Elliott Cutler of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital performed the world’s first successful heart valve surgery – a mitral valve repair. The patient was a 12-year-old girl with rheumatic mitral stenosis. The development of the heart-lung machine in the 1950s paved the way for replacement of the mitral valve with an artificial valve in the 1960s. For decades after, mitral valve replacement was the only surgical option for patients with a severely diseased mitral valve. However, there are some significant downsides to a prosthetic mitral valve. Infection of the valve can occur, which is dangerous and difficult to treat. Patients with mechanical heart valves are required to take blood thinners for the rest of their lives, which presents a risk of bleeding complications. The artificial mitral valve has an elevated risk of stroke. Patients with mechanical heart valves who use warfarin for anticoagulation have to be on long-term anticoagulation therapy. This means they must go to the clinic and have a lab blood draw done, typically once a month but more frequently if the level needs to be closely monitored until it is in the therapeutic range. The therapeutic range for most adults with a mechanical valve is an INR of 2.5–3.5. Finally, artificial tissue valves will wear out – on average lasting between 10 and 15 years, requiring further surgery at an advanced age. In the past two decades, some surgeons have embraced surgical techniques to repair the damaged native valve, rather than replace it. These techniques were pioneered by a French heart surgeon, Dr. Alain F. Carpentier. A repair still involves major cardiac surgery but for many patients presents the significant advantage of avoiding blood thinners and may provide a more durable result. Not all damaged valves are suitable for repair; in some, the state of valve disease is too advanced and replacement is necessary. Often, a surgeon must decide during the operation itself whether a repair or a replacement is the best course of action. For patients with the most common type of mitral valve disease, termed \\"degenerative\\" or \\"myxomatous\\" mitral valve disease, repair rates are very high and long term durability is excellent. There has been great debate about timing of surgery in patients with asymptomatic mitral valve regurgitation. The traditional surgical approach to a mitral valve repair is a full or partial sternotomy, in which the surgeon cuts through the breastbone at the center of the chest to access the heart. There are minimally invasive (port access) options available pioneered by Hugo Vanerman in Belgium. The minimally invasive approach does not involve cutting the breastbone, but instead uses multiple incisions in the side of the chest and the leg. Cardiac surgeons are not unanimous about the relative merits of sternotomy versus the minimally invasive approach. The minimally invasive approach can produce a less prominent scar, is beneficial for very obese patients, and may allow the patient to return to their normal activity sooner than a sternotomy. But some cardiac surgeons argue that unless performed by the most experienced cardiac centers, minimally invasive surgery can involve a longer time on a bypass machine, a lower repair rate, and higher (although still low) risk of stroke. One cardiac surgery professor said, \\"I think the only benefit is for cosmesis for the patient and the benefit is for marketing and growing our practices for ourselves because it’s a good way to grow one's practice.\\"http://www.mitralvalverepair.org/content/view/260/ Ani Anyanwu, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, \\"'Minimally Invasive Surgery' - Facts\\", MitralValveRepair.org, October 13, 2011. Retrieved 17 August 2012. Robotic mitral valve repair operations are also being utilized throughout the United States. In the 2000s there have been several trials of a newer strategy of mitral valve repair that does not require major cardiac surgery. Through a catheter inserted in the groin, the valve leaflets are clipped together. This technique – percutaneous mitral valve repair – is available in Europe but still in clinical trial in the United States. It is a highly specialized technique only available at select hospitals. Early trial results suggest that it may be a beneficial approach for patients who are at high risk from conventional surgery.Mitral Valve Prolapse, Functional MR, Cardiac Surgery, Degenerative MR, and Cardiomyopathy - Evalve, Inc As early as January 2000 a team of doctorsGuillermo Mojena Morfa; Julio Taín Blázquez; Ángel M. Paredes Cordero; Horacio Pérez López; Lisbeth González González at the Instituto de Cardiología y Cirugía Cardiovascular in La Habana, Cuba have performed beating heart mitral valve repair or replacement. The beating heart mitral valve replacement technique is as safe as the arrested heart technique, and is the recommended alternative to arrested heart technique.

The paper first began publishing in 1868, making it the oldest continually operating student newspaper in North America followed by The Harvard Crimson (1873) and The Columbia Daily Spectator (1877). (The Brunswickan, printed out of the University of New Brunswick, actually predates The Gazette by a year, but began printing in magazine format). The founding editors were J.J. Cameron (who went on to found the Queen's Journal), A.P.Seeton, and W.E. Roscoe. The Gazettes weekly circulation is 2,000, making it Halifax's third-largest free print publication. The Gazette is run, financed and published by the Dalhousie Gazette Publishing Society, a group of students made up from the Gazettes editors and contributors. The society operates independently of the Dalhousie Student Union, though the paper does charge an annual student levy through the DSU (approx $5.00 per student each academic year) as a means of complementing its advertising income. The Gazettes primary mandate is to scrutinize and report on the financial, social and administrative powers of the Dalhousie Student Union, its student societies, and the Dalhousie University administration. Within this mandate, the Gazette also covers events and news related to the Dalhousie community, student body and alumni. As one of Halifax's major independent publications, the Gazettes Dalhousie-centric mandate has often been expanded to include issues outside of the university community proper. Recent publication years of the Gazette gave seen a large emphasis on international events, local artists and regional politics. Reflecting this independent disposition, the Gazettes layout has dispensed with front-page story copy, printing instead a full-cover graphic (usually a photograph) and large teasers with page numbers under the fold. Along with their Dalhousie counterparts, University of King's College students have made significant contributions to the paper despite being outside of the Gazettes levy umbrella. Aside from providing the paper with many staff reporters and photographers, King's students and alumni have recently filled some of the Gazettes top editorial positions. The Editors-in-Chief for the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 years were King's alumni, and significant portions of the newspaper's editorial staff over the years has come from King's. A typical issue of the Gazette in 2013/2014 was 24 11x10 pages, with approximately 800 words appearing per page. As of 2019, the Gazette has 10 paid positions: an editor-in-chief, news editor, opinions editor, arts & lifestyle editor, sports editor, visuals editor, copyeditor, page designer, business and administration manager and a distribution manager.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Tower Rock has also been dubbed with many names over the centuries: Cap de Roche, Cap St. Croix la Tour, La Roche de la Croix, Rock of St. Cosme, Castle Rock and Devil's Tower.Tower Rock, Sentinel of the Mississippi https://www.academia.edu/3546739/Tower_Rock_Sentinel_of_the_Mississippi The earliest mention by Europeans of this island is by French missionary Jacques Marquette in 1673: > ...we found ourselves at a river called ouaboukigou, The mouth of which is > at the 36th degree of latitude. Before reaching it, we passed by a Place > that is dreaded by the Savages, because they believe that a manitou is > there, — that is to say, a demon, — that devours travelers; and The savages, > who wished to divert us from our undertaking, warned us against it. This is > the demon: there is a small cove, surrounded by rocks 20 feet high, into > which The whole Current of the river rushes; and, being pushed back against > the waters following It, and checked by an Island near by, the Current is > Compelled to pass through a narrow Channel. This is not done without a > violent Struggle between all these waters, which force one another back, or > without a great din, which inspires terror in the savages.... Another early mention of the rock was by French-Canadian seminarian priests: fathers Montigny, Davion and St. Cosme, who planted a cross on the rock in 1698. A ridge directly across the river from the island is named Devil's Backbone. The earliest European inhabitants on the island were a band of river pirates, who settled here after being driven off Spanish soil west of the Mississippi River, was a pirate ambush spot. This outlaw haven was destroyed by the United States Army dragoons, most likely sent from the army post upriver at Fort Kaskaskia in 1803. Meriwether Lewis mentions the island in his journals, stating that rivermen who passed the rock would celebrate in a way similar to sailors crossing the equator, by raising a drink of spirits. Lutherans from Germany considered this island their Plymouth Rock, for here they landed, after seeking a place where they could practice religious freedom. In a Nov. 6, 2003, article in the Southern Illinoisan newspaper, Mike Keeley, manager of the Tower Rock National Historic Site for the Missouri Department of Conservation, said that it's possible to walk out to Tower Rock every year or so because of low water levels on the river.

His fields of study are South Asian and Indian Ocean history. Bose taught at Tufts University until 2001, when he accepted the Gardiner Chair of Oceanic History and Affairs at Harvard University. Bose is also the director of the Netaji Research Bureau in Kolkata, India, a research center and archives devoted to the life and work of Bose's great uncle, the Indian nationalist, Subhas Chandra Bose. Bose is the author most recently of His Majesty's Opponent: Subhas Chandra Bose and India's Struggle against Empire (2011) and A Hundred Horizons: The Indian Ocean in the Age of Global Empire (2006). From 2014 to 2019, Bose has served as a Member of India's Parliament from the Jadavpur Constituency in West Bengal with his party affiliation in Mamata Banerjee led All India Trinamool Congress (TMC). Bose is married to a Pakistani American Historian Ayesha Jalal.https://reviewit.pk/indo-pak-weddings/ Early life and family Sugata Bose was born in Calcutta, India. After studying at Presidency College, Kolkata, University of Calcutta Bose subsequently completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge before being named a research fellow of St. Catharine's College at Cambridge in 1981. The grandnephew of Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose and grandson of nationalist Sarat Chandra Bose, Bose is the son of former Trinamool Congress parliamentarian Krishna Bose and paediatrician Sisir Kumar Bose. Bose is married to accomplished Pakistani American Historian Ayesha Jalal. Bose's brother, Sumantra Bose, teaches at the London School of Economics; his sister, Sarmila Bose, is a researcher at Oxford University.Anjali Puri, Lunch With BS: Sugata Bose, Business Standard, 4 March 2016. Academic career After completing his PhD at Cambridge, Sugata Bose began his career as a professor of history and diplomacy at Tufts University. In 2001 Bose was appointed to the Gardiner Chair of Oceanic History and Affairs at Harvard University, a position that had lain vacant for almost two decades, one which had been previously occupied by historians of the Western Hemisphere, but one for which Harvard specifically wanted a historian of South Asia. From 2003 to 2010, Bose headed up the university's South Asia initiative as well as the graduate program in the history department. Books In 2011 Bose published His Majesty's Opponent: Subhas Chandra Bose and India's Struggle against Empire, a biography of his great uncle Subhas Bose. The biography, a trade book, has been criticised in scholarly reviews for soft-pedaling or oversimplifying Subhas Chandra Bose's alliances with Italian Fascism, German National Socialism, and Japanese imperialism. The book has also been criticised for its optimistic speculations on what Subhas Bose might have accomplished had he lived. Some popular reviews have been more positive. In his earlier A Hundred Horizons: The Indian Ocean in the Age of Global Empire (2006), Bose attempts to challenge the thesis pioneered by Kirti N. Chaudhuri in and developed by Andre Wink and others, which holds that the world's first \\"global economy,\\" the trans-Indian-ocean maritime economy—whose trade was assisted by the alternating winds and currents of the monsoons and which arose in the wake of the spread of Islam—was in turn undercut by European capitalism in the early 18th century. Instead, Bose contends, in the main thesis of his book, an inter-regional economy of middle-level bazaar merchants and traders continued well into the late 1920s, existing between the dominant European capitalists at the top and the peasants and peddlers at the bottom. This according to Bose, was not just the case in the market of goods and services, but also in the barter of ideas and culture. Attempting to bolster the latter notion are sections in the book on Mohandas K. Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, and Bose's great uncle Subhas Chandra Bose. A Hundred Horizons was praised by academic reviewers for explicating the transformations to networks which linked Indian Ocean societies, beyond the influence of colonial empires, and for exploring \\"cosmopolitan notions of anticolonialism\\" throughout the Indian Ocean world. However, Bose's delineation of that economy has been criticised for not going much beyond India and Indians, for reducing the complex exchange between the British and India to a clash of Indian nationalism and British tyranny; and for not providing sufficient warrant for the main thesis in the book. Bose is also the author and editor of books on the economic, social and political history of modern South Asia. Beginning his career with work on the economy of agrarian Bengal, Bose published two volumes on his research. Agrarian Bengal: Economy, Social Structure and Politics, 1919–1947, published in 1986, contextualised rural economic life within the wider currents of the global economy, while a 1993 contribution to the New Cambridge History of India, Peasant Labour and Colonial Capital: Rural Bengal since 1770, analysed two and a half centuries of regional economic and social change. Political career Sugata Bose was a Trinamool Congress MP (2014 -2019) at the 16th Lok Sabha, representing the Jadavpur constituency. Other activities In January 2012, Bose joined New Yorker editor David Remnick, former New York Times editor Joseph Lelyveld and journalist Peter Popham at the sixth Jaipur Literature Festival in a panel on the challenges of biographical writing. Bose has been active in researching, speaking, and publishing on Rabindranath Tagore, contributing to projects across different media. In 2007, Krishna and Sugata Bose co-edited Purabi: the East in its Feminine Gender, a book and CD of Tagore's poetry and music. Bose has produced a four-CD set of Tagore's songs written outside of India as Visva Yatri Rabindranath, and has lectured widely on Tagore in North America, Europe, and Asia. Beyond his work at Harvard and Tufts, Bose has helped steer two major projects advancing higher education in India. Since 2007, Bose has been a member of the Government of India's Nalanda Mentor Group, which seeks to establish an international university on the site of the ancient University of Nalanda in Bihar. Since 2011, Bose has served as chairman of the Presidency College Mentor Group, which seeks to revitalise the 194-year-old Kolkata college.

Formed by Gustavo Lapis Ahumad in New York City, the band is known for their live set that includes lighting, smoke and theatrical effects. Plagued with consistent line-up changes over the past two decades, the band still plays throughout Manhattan with the current line-up of Gustavo Lapis Ahumad (vocals/guitar), Pay-Dro (drums), Marcus Pan (bass/backing vocals) and Brandon (guitar). Bitter Grace has played numerous clubs, but concentrate mostly in Manhattan where they are located. They've taken the stage at CBGB, the Gallery, Club Rare, Downtime and Rothko's in recent years. History Bitter Grace was formed by Gustavo Lapis Ahumad in 1985 and almost immediately began playing live throughout New York City. The line-up of the band was constantly evolving and for reasons like this it took over ten years for the first album, God and the Abyss, to finally be released and distributed by Middle Pillar Presents. The album itself was touched by numerous hands, with multiple drummers, bassists and guitarists being involved until its mastering and release. Recent The current line-up has changed already over the past year with Thad Jasonis leaving to join New Vile System in Queens, New York City. He was replaced by the returning Brandon who played guitar on the recordings of Shimmer prior to leaving the state. This new album, another seven years in the making, is due to be released in the early reaches of 2006. Previously released singles from the album, \\"Shimmering\\" and \\"Slave\\", have achieved college air play and Internet radio play in the summer of 2005 when they were officially released. The 2005 live shows found Bitter Grace playing throughout Manhattan prior to the release of the new album. On September 18, 2008, the band announced on their MySpace that Shimmer will be released early 2009, and they are currently working on the third album entitled Critical. Evolution The release of \\"Slave\\" and \\"Shimmering\\" have shown that Bitter Grace have laced an industrial and EBM style into their previous post-punk goth rock style on God and the Abyss. Live sets have started to incorporate more lighting and shadow textures for a highly theatrical affect opposed to previous garage-style shows done in the early years.

He made contributions to the fields of geometry, optics, conics, mechanics, music, and astronomy. He edited the works of classical authors including Archimedes, Apollonius, Autolycus, Theodosius and Serenus. He also composed his own unique treatises on mathematics and mathematical science. Life Francesco was born in Messina with the surname of Marulì, although the surname is sometimes reported as \\"Mauroli\\".\\"MAUROLICO, Francesco\\" by Rosario Moscheo, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Volume 72 (2008). He was the son of Antonio Marulì, master of the Messina coin factory who had studied with the famous Neoplatonic Hellenist Constantine Lascaris.\\"MAUROLICO, Francesco\\" by Rosario Moscheo, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Volume 72 (2008). Francesco therefore received a \\"Lascarian\\" education through the father, and from Francesco Faraone and Giacomo Genovese, also disciples of Lascaris, whose influence is recognizable.Russo, Attilio (2018). “Una nuova ipotesi sul nome ‘Maurolico’ ”, Archivio Storico Messinese, 99, Messina 2018, 37-71, especially 50-51 and 70-71 note 69. \\"MAUROLICO, Francesco\\" by Rosario Moscheo, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Volume 72 (2008). In 1534 Francesco Marulì changed his surname to Mauro Lyco (from the meaning of \\"occult wolf\\"), after having adopted for eight years, uninterruptedly, the name of Mauro Lycio (\\"occult Apollo\\") as a member of a Messina academy.Russo, Attilio (2018). “Una nuova ipotesi sul nome ‘Maurolico’ ”, Archivio Storico Messinese, 99, Messina 2018, 37-71. Having already obtained priestly ordination since 1521 and, consequently, some ecclesiastical benefit, he was appointed abbot of the monastery of Santa Maria del Parto (in Castelbuono) in 1550 by Simone Ventimiglia marquis of Geraci, pupil and patron of Maurolico.\\"MAUROLICO, Francesco\\" by Rosario Moscheo, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Volume 72 (2008). Quadrati fabrica et eius usus, 1546 He died in 1575 of natural death, during a plague epidemic due to which the mathematician had retired to Contrada Annunziata: a hilly area north of Messina, where the Marulì family owned a villa that probably had hosted, sometimes, the academy of which the scientist-humanist had been part.Russo, Attilio (2018). “Una nuova ipotesi sul nome ‘Maurolico’ ”, Archivio Storico Messinese, 99, Messina 2018, 37-71, especially 58-64. He is buried in the church of San Giovanni di Malta in Messina, where his nephews Francesco and Silvestro Maurolico erected an artistic marble sarcophagus, accompanied by the uncle’s bust and Maurolico’s coat of arms with the wolf and the star Sirius. The coat of arms of Maurolico, with the wolf and the star Sirius Accomplishments In 1535 Maurolico collaborated with the painter Polidoro da Caravaggio in designing triumphal arches (composing the Latin inscriptions for this apparato) for the entry into the city of Messina by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Like his father, he also became head of the Messina mint and for a time was in charge of maintaining the fortifications of the city on behalf of Charles V. Maurolico tutored the two sons of Charles's viceroy in Sicily, Juan de Vega, and had the patronage of many rich and powerful men. He also corresponded with scholars such as Clavius and Federico Commandino. In 1547 he collaborated with the sculptor Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli for the creation of the famous Orion Fountain in Messina. By Maurolico are the Latin inscriptions on the ground-level basin of the fountain and, probably, most of the Neoplatonic program for this monumental civic sculpture.Russo, Attilio (2001). “La fontana del Sirio d’Orione, o delle metamorfosi“, Città & Territorio, II/2001, Messina 2001, pp. 30-41. Between 1548 and 1550, he stayed at the castle of Pollina in Sicily as a guest of the marquis Giovanni II Ventimiglia, and utilized the castle tower in order to carry out astronomical observations. Maurolico's astronomical observations include a sighting of the supernova that appeared in Cassiopeia in 1572. Tycho Brahe published details of his observations in 1574; the supernova is now known as Tycho's Supernova. In 1569, he was appointed professor at the University of Messina. Works 1654 edition of Conica by Apollonius of Perga edited by Francesco Maurolico * Maurolico's Photismi de lumine et umbra and Diaphana concern the refraction of light and attempted to explain the natural phenomenon of the rainbow. He also studied the camera obscura. Photismi were completed in 1521, Diaphana first part 1523, the second and third ones in 1552, but all the material was published posthumously only in 1611. * His unpublished manuscript Compaginationes solidorum regularium (1537) includes a statement of Euler's formula V-E+F=2 for the Platonic solids, long before Leonhard Euler formulated it more generally for convex polyhedra in 1752. * His Arithmeticorum libri duo (1575) includes the first known proof by mathematical induction. * His De momentis aequalibus (completed in 1548, but first published only in 1685) attempted to calculate the barycenter of various bodies (pyramid, paraboloid, etc.). * In his Sicanicarum rerum compendium, he presented the history of Sicily, and included some autobiographical details. He had been commissioned to write this work, and in 1553 the Senate of Messina granted him a salary of 100 gold pieces per year for two years so that he could finish this work and his works on mathematics. * His De Sphaera Liber Unus (1575) contains a fierce attack against Copernicus' heliocentrism, in which Maurolico writes that Copernicus “deserved a whip or a scourge rather than a refutation”. * Maurolico published a Cosmographia in which he described a methodology for measuring the earth, which was later employed by Jean Picard in measuring length of meridian arc in 1670. * Maurolico published an edition of Aristotle's Mechanics, and a work on music. He summarized Ortelius's Theatrum orbis terrarum and also wrote Grammatica rudimenta (1528) and De lineis horariis. He made a map of Sicily, which was published in 1575. * Maurolico worked on ancient mathematical texts: Theodosius of Bithynia, Menelaus of Alexandria, Autolycus of Pitane, Euclid, Apollonius of Perga and Archimedes. He did not make new translations, but working on the existing ones, he provided new and sound interpretations of Greek mathematics. Death and legacy He died at Messina. The lunar crater Maurolycus is named after him. There is a school in Messina with his name. In 2009 the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage has ordained the establishment of the Edizione nazionale dell'opera matematica di Francesco Maurolico (National Edition of Maurolico's mathematical oeuvre).

Bole (DD-755), an , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Lieutenant Commander John Archibald Bole, Jr., who was the commanding officer of which is thought to be lost on 16 February 1943. A John A. Bole was renamed on 15 June 1944 prior to being launched 15 February 1945. John A. Bole, was laid down on 20 May 1944 by Bethlehem Steel Co., Staten Island, New York and launched on 1 November 1944; sponsored by Mrs. John A. Bole, Jr., widow of Lieutenant Commander Bole. The ship was commissioned on 3 March 1945, Commander E. B. Billingsley in command. Service history =World War II= Following shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, John A. Bole escorted the aircraft carrier north to New York, arriving on 24 April 1945. After moving to Boston to join , she sailed on 15 May for the Pacific during the final push in the war against Japan. Steaming via the Panama Canal, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 June 1945. The ship joined a carrier group in Hawaiian waters, took part in the air strike on Wake Island on 20 June, and escorted a carrier to Eniwetok, arriving on 21 June. John A. Bole arrived at Okinawa on 29 June for picket and patrol duty; and, although ground fighting had virtually ceased, weeks of intermittent air raids and picket duty were still in store for the fleet. The ship remained off Okinawa until the Japanese acceptance of surrender terms on 15 August, then departed for the East China and Yellow Seas to support the occupation and to take part in minesweeping operations. John A. Bole joined a cruiser-destroyer force on 8 September off Jinsen, Korea, to cover the landings of troops at that important port. She remained until 25 September, and arrived three days later at Saishu To, south of the Korean Peninsula, to accept the surrender of the island and demilitarize it. The veteran destroyer remained in the Far East after the end of the war to carry mail and passengers between Japan, Korea, and Chinese ports, supporting the efforts of American Marines to protect Allied lives and stabilize the Chinese situation. While at Qingdao on 20 February 1946, upon receiving a distress signal from a sinking merchantmen, she succeeded in rescuing 13 survivors. Bole departed on 5 March for San Francisco and, after stopping at Guam and Pearl Harbor, arrived on 27 March 1946. Following a long repair period to prepare her for peacetime service, the destroyer arrived San Diego on 10 April 1947 to begin a regular schedule of training maneuvers and cruises for Naval Reservists. She continued to operate on the West Coast, with occasional visits to Hawaii, through 1949. =Korean War= With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, John A. Bole began intensive preparations for combat service. Sailing from San Diego on 30 September, she steamed via Japan to join Task Force 77 off the Korean coast. With the amphibious assault on Inchon on 15 September, an end run made possible by control of the sea, the tide of the ground war rapidly reversed. The Communist forces far to the south collapsed. John A. Bole shifted from amphibious attack to fire support of advancing UN troops. She then screened carriers during the air operations, helping to support both battle-line air strikes and interdiction of northern supply lines. On 11 April 1951, John A. Bole was stationed near the coast of mainland China, three miles off Swatow, China, on the orders of General Douglas MacArthur, in an unsuccessful attempt by him to provoke China into a war with the United States.James Edwin Alexander, Naval History: Jan/Feb 1997, Vol. 11, Issue 1; pg. 48-50, U.S. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD. Armed Chinese junks surrounded the ship, but in the meantime, MacArthur was relieved and the ship was moved away from its \\"sitting duck\\" role off the Chinese harbor. John A. Bole also steamed with support convoys into Inchon before returning to San Diego in mid-June 1951. The ship was underway again for Korea on 3 January 1952. Upon arrival she helped maintain the pressure on Communist troops in the stalemated land war by screening carriers during air attacks. Bole also took part in shore bombardment along both the east and west coasts of North Korea, operating with British and Dutch ships. The ship moved to the Formosa Straits for patrol duty designed to deter Chinese Communist aggression there, finally returning to San Diego on 11 July 1952. Following a yard period in which she added 3-inch rapid fire guns to her armament, John A. Bole departed on 21 February 1953 for her third Korean tour. During March she operated off the coast with Saint Paul, and sailed on 10 April for the Formosa Straits to resume patrol duty. Then after returning to Korean waters, the destroyer sailed on 1 June to Wonsan harbor for six days dueling with shore batteries while protecting the allied- held offshore islands. She then screened the battleship before the Korean armistice on 27 July 1953, after which she returned to Japan. Escort duty with the carrier closed her cruise, and John A. Bole arrived San Diego on 22 September 1953. =1954-1967 (Cold War, Formosa Patrol, Vietnam)= The destroyer returned to the Far East again in 1954, taking part in the continuing Formosa Patrol and in amphibious training exercises. She sailed from San Diego on 20 April and returned 17 October, adding carrier operations in the South China Sea and antisubmarine warfare exercises off Okinawa to her busy schedule. In 1955 and again in 1956 she spent six-month periods in these familiar waters, training and showing graphically the value of seapower to the security of the United States and her allies. John A. Bole sailed on 29 July 1957 for the Western Pacific, this time visiting Pago Pago; Auckland, New Zealand; and Manus en route to Japan. She took part in carrier operations with and in December again steamed Formosa Strait. The ship returned to San Diego on 8 January 1958 and took part in exercises off California until July. John A. Bole again sailed westward on 23 August 1958, this time amid mounting chaos from revolt in Indonesia and growing trouble in southeast Asia. She operated in the Philippines and on Formosa Patrol, helping to stabilize affairs in this strategic region, returning to San Diego on 16 February 1959. The destroyer made still another cruise to the Far East 1959-60, sailing on 30 October. She operated with the 7th Fleet's hunter-killer force off Okinawa during November and December, arriving Formosa on 4 January 1960 for patrol duty. She returned to San Diego on 12 March 1960. In June, John A. Bole served as an air-sea rescue station ship for President Dwight D. Eisenhower's flight across the Pacific, and during the summer she embarked NROTC Midshipmen for training. In October she was assigned to a hunter-killer group built around , and after training, departed on 4 March 1961 for the Far East. The ships carried out further training, this time with Canadian ships out of Pearl Harbor, but with a worsening of the Laos situation, steamed to Subic Bay to bolster Navy strength and deter more serious trouble. Hunter-killer operations continued until September, and John A. Bole returned to California via the northern great-circle route to help gather hydrographic data, arriving her home port on 18 September. John A. Bole entered San Francisco Naval Shipyard in late 1961 to undergo a major Fleet-Rehabilitation-and-Modernization overhaul, designed to equip her with the latest equipment and lengthen her active service life several years. Emerging in July 1962, she took part in training operations for the remainder of the year, interrupted by several weeks of alert at sea during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October. During the first few months of 1963, she operated out of San Diego, sailing 1 April 1963 for Pearl Harbor and the Western Pacific. This cruise helped to maintain the vital American presence in the Far East, and she returned to San Diego on 3 December 1963. In the first half of 1964, she was engaged in antisubmarine operations, including tests of her new DASH. John A. Bole sailed 23 October 1964 for the Western Pacific with a group composed of and other destroyers. After maneuvers in Hawaiian waters, she reported to Commander 7th Fleet on 2 January 1965 to resume peacekeeping operations in the troubled region. During the deployment, the destroyer operated with a carrier task group and an ASW hunter-killer group, then patrolled Taiwan Straits. From 9–25 February, she operated off Vietnam. Returning to San Diego on 24 May, the destroyer entered Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard late in June for overhaul and stayed there through the remaining summer. She operated out of San Diego until sailing on 22 March 1966 for the Far East. On 18 April, she began naval gunfire support duties off Vietnam which continued until she began plane guard patrol at Yankee Station on 4 May. On 8 May, the destroyer sailed to Japan for repairs but was back at Yankee Station on the 25th. But for brief runs to Hong Kong and Subic Bay, Bole remained in the war zone until 27 July, when she headed for Taiwan. She visited Malaysia before heading home via Subic Bay, Guam, and Pearl Harbor, arriving San Diego on 24 September. She operated out of home port for the remainder of the year, and in 1967 prepared for future action. =1967-1970 (Vietnam)= John A. Bole departed San Diego for a Westpac cruise on 28 December 1967. Arriving in the Hawaiian Islands on 13 January 1968, John A. Bole got underway on 14 January and operated in the Hawaiian Operating Areas, conducting training qualifications exercises before departing en route to Yokosuka, Japan on 19 January. On 26 January, news of the capture of by North Korea was received and Bole was diverted to the Sea of Japan for contingency operations as part of Operation Formation Star. The destroyer operated in the Sea of Japan maintaining Surface Action Unit (SAU) stations through heavy seas, cold, ice and snow. On 12 February John A. Bole conducted a Search and Rescue (SAR) effort to a South Korean fishing vessel in distress. After transferring food and water, the destroyer took the vessel in tow and proceeded to Po-Hang, South Korea where the tow was transferred to a Republic of Korea (ROK) naval vessel on 13 February. Bole then proceeded to plane guard station for en route to Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin. While operating in the Gulf of Tonkin on 25 March, the destroyer conducted an alongside submarine replenishment (SUBREP) for . On 30 March, John A. Bole departed the Gulf of Tonkin for its first, 10-day port visit of the deployment and destroyer tender availability with in Kaohsiung, Taiwan (3–13 April). On 13 April John A. Bole departed Kaohsiung for II Corps, Republic of Vietnam, arriving 15 April in Qui Nhon harbor and relieved of Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS duties). The destroyer conducted NGFS in II Corps through 23 April and departed for Hong Kong. John A. Bole arrived in Hong Kong 25 April for a port visit. The warship departed Hong Kong 30 April for Yankee Station plane guard duties. On 5 May John A. Bole rendezvoused with and assumed plane guard duties. On 6–9 May the destroyer operated with for plane guard. From 10–13 May the destroyer conducted plane guard duties for ; from 13–16 May for ; 16–19 May for Enterprise; 19-120 May for Kitty Hawk; and 20–24 May for Yorktown. On 24 May John A. Bole departed the Gulf of Tonkin en route to Singapore, crossing the equator on 28 May and arriving at HM Royal Dockyard Singapore on 29 May. On 2 June, the ship's mascot, Ensign Chiko, a monkey, joined the crew. On 3 June the destroyer departed Singapore for II Corps Republic of Vietnam. On 5 June John A. Bole arrived at II Corps and relieved of NGFS duties. The destroyer was relieved of NGFS duties by and detached en route to Sasebo, Japan. On 16 June John A. Bole rendezvoused with Yorktown and commenced plane guard duties en route to Sasebo arriving at the US Naval Station on 19 June. On 21 the destroyer departed Sasebo en route to home port of San Diego arriving there on 5 July and mooring at the US Naval Station completing the Westpac deployment. The warship remained in San Diego, operating in the SOCAL OPAREAS until departing for Hunters Point, San Francisco for a three-month Regular Overhaul. John A.

The mansion served the next 30 years as a royal residence and embassy of Montenegro. In 1913, the Ottoman government repossessed it, which became home to the granddaughter of Sultan Mehmed V Reşad. After the foundation of the Turkish Republic, Prince Mehmed Ali Hasan, grandson of Khedive İsmail Paşa, purchased the then derelict house and commissioned the architect Edouard de Nari to build the present house. However, it remained unused for many years until the elder sister of the Egyptian prince made it her home in 1944. In 1951 Hacı Ömer Sabancı, father of Sakıp Sabancı and founder of Sabancı Holding, purchased the mansion for spending summer months with his family. Inside the entrance gate of his mansion, he placed the bronze statue of a horse, he purchased at an auction. The sculpture was designed by Louis-Joseph Daumas in Paris in 1864 and cast by Vor Thiebaut. The house became popularly known as Atlı Köşk (Equestrian Villa).

He has been the leader since 1985, alongside Richard Chrisjohn; an additional leader. In 1993, the United States government formally recognized Mr. Halbritter as the OIN leader. The tribal council consists of 8 clan members.OIN Leadership Traditionally, the male council members are responsible for daily decisions. The Clan Mothers make long-term decisions. Tradition also requires Nation leaders and Members to consider the impact on the next seven generations when making decisions. =OIN Court= The OIN has its own court system. The current presiding judges are Honorable Robert G. Hurlbutt and Honorable John J. Brunetti.Oneida Indian Nation Court The Court is governed by its own Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rules of Evidence, Rules of Debt Collection, and Rules of Peacemaking.OIN ordinances, regulations, and rules The Court operates under the guidelines on traditional Oneida values of peaceful mediation and reconciliation.OIN Court =OIN police department= The OIN has its own police department that coordinates with New York State, Madison and Oneida County, and local law enforcement.Nation Police \\"Deputized by federal authority, the Oneida Nation Police Department was the first tribal police force in the U.S. to receive accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies and is a professionally trained law enforcement agency empowered by the sovereign authority of the Oneida Indian Nation.\\" Gary Henderson is the current police chief.Nation Police Staff Directory =Treaties= In addition to being a member of the nation of the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua,Treaty with the Six Nations, 1794 the OIN is a member of the following treaties: *Treaty of Amity Commerce and Navigation; known as the Jay TreatyJay Treaty *Treaty with the Six Nations, 1784; known as the Veterans TreatyVeterans Treaty *Treaty with the Six Nations, 1789; known as the Veterans TreatyVeterans Treaty *Treaty with the Oneida, Etc., 1794; known as the Veterans TreatyVeterans Treaty Membership The tribal council of the OIN has established the rules for citizenship: it requires documentation of at least 1/4 blood ancestry (equivalent to one grandparent) through the maternal line.OIN Fact Sheet The OIN and other Iroquois nations have had a matrilineal kinship system, with descent and inheritance through the mother's line.  Clans  The OIN consists of three clans: Turtle, Wolf, and Bear. Each Nation member belongs to one of these clans. A child is considered born into the mother's clan, and takes social status from her people. = Creation = Legend has it that clan names and the matrilineal kinship system came from a response to issues that arose during the Haudenosaunee mourning process. Prior to clans being created, the entire Oneida village would mourn after the death of a village member. This caused problems as important decisions were put on hold during the time of mourning. Village leaders were at a loss as to how to continue everyday life while at the same time observing traditional mourning practices. A young village member approached the leaders with a possible solution. He suggested sending three female elders to the nearby river, having them build a fire, and spend the night. At first light the following morning the women were to pray to the Creator and take notice of the first animal that approached the river. Once the women had seen an animal, they were to report back to the village leaders. The elders put the young man’s plan into action. Three women were sent to the river. Upon their return one woman reported that she had seen a turtle at the edge of the river. The second woman reported seeing a wolf running along the river. The third woman stated that she had seen a bear feeding in the river along the rocks. Following the reports of the women, village leaders named the Oneida clans the Turtle, Wolf and Bear clans. They determined that a village member’s clan would be passed through the mother's line from generation to generation, as women have the Creator’s gift to create life. The Oneida Nation is still a matrilineal kinship society. After the clans were established, the people developed their practices for a mourning process. When there was a death in the village, the clan members of that person would mourn. The members of a second clan would console them, and the members of the third clan would carry on village business as usual.Clan creation legend = Meaning = The Haudenosaunee people are made up of several Nations. Among these nations are kinship groups called clans. While Nation members have their immediate family of parents and siblings, they also have an extended family of fellow Clan members. As a matrilineal society, each clan member is born into their clan by their mother. The three Oneida Nation clans are named after animals, the turtle, wolf, and bear. Each animal is considered to have certain positive characteristics or attributes. The turtle teaches patience, as well as the importance of never giving up. Turtles are also seen to be representative of strength and solidarity. They are thought to be old and wise, and are well respected. The wolf teaches the importance of using your ears, listening and being watchful. They embody a strong sense of family. Finally, the bear is seen as gentle and strong. Bears are seen as having strength in knowing that takes more strength not to raise your hand and strike, than to give into the impulse to strike.Clan animal meanings; Haudenosaunee creation legend, Businesses The tribe set up Oneida Nation Enterprises, through which it operates a number of businesses in Central New York. As of 2013, it was the largest employer of the area, with approximately 5,000 jobs total.Oneida Nation Enterprises website. Accessed: September 3, 2013. Business interests include: =Bingo and gasoline= In the early 1990s, the OIN opened a bingo hall. Ray Halbritter (Oneida), opened a gas station known as SavOn across the street. The cheaper gasoline made the gas station popular among the community. Eventually the OIN bought SavOn and expanded it into multiple locations within the area. Today SavOn (or SāvOn) is a chain of gas stations and convenience stores in Oneida and Madison counties, owned and operated by the Oneida Indian Nation. =Casinos and resorts= The OIN opened several casinos. The first was the Turning Stone Casino & Resort, in 1993. After the 2013 landmark settlement, the OIN opened the Yellow Brick Road Casino in June 2015. And on March 3, 2018, OIN opened the Point Place Casino in Bridgeport, NY.OIN Enterprises Turning Stone Resort Casino The tribe's most profitable business is the Turning Stone Resort & Casino, which has been expanding continuously since its opening in 1993. The current game- space is approximately . Begun as a bingo hall, it has been developed as a large, Class III gaming facility and resort.Class III gaming is the broadest class of gambling under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). The entertainment site includes nationally ranked hotels and restaurants. Many shows are performed throughout the year. The resort is the host for a fall Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) tournament. Some parties have challenged the tribal-state gaming compact between the OIN and New York state. The 2013 agreement between the OIN, Madison and Oneida Counties, and New York resolved all challenges to the casino. In 2016, the casino and resort underwent a $20 million upgrade and renovation project to provide better smoke-free areas on the gambling floor, improve ventilation facilities, add a cafeteria, and add/upgrade rooms.Turning Stone To Limit Smokers To Own Mini- Casino \\"Yellow Brick Road\\" Casino In June 2015, the OIN opened a casino based on themes from the popular book and film, The Wizard of Oz, indirectly honoring writer L. Frank Baum, who was from Central New York. The facility is located in Tops Plaza, 800 W. Genesee St., Chittenango, NY and contains of gaming space with over 400 slot machines; open 24/7. Table games are held Sunday-Wednesday, 11am - 11pm; Thursday, 11am - 12am; Friday, 11am - 3am; and Saturday 10am-3am.yellowbrickroadcasino.com Other Native Americans have criticized this choice, as Baum was noted for supporting genocide against the Sioux Nation. The Washington Post noted that their choice was a problem, as Mr. Halbritter led the effort to force the Washington Redskins to change their name by dropping the reference to Native Americans because Mr. Halbritter believes it is derogatory to the plight of all Native Americans. Point Place Casino Located at 450 NY-31, Bridgeport, NY, this facility contains of gaming space. It is the newest casino the Oneida Nation Enterprises operates and it is entirely smoke-free.pointplacecasino.com Visitors can choose from over 500 slot machines and 20 classic table games. Table game hours are Sunday - Thursday 10am - 12am and Friday - Saturday 10am - 3am. =Other business ventures= The OIN has purchased a marina on the south-eastern shore of Oneida Lake and many plots of land in the area. The Indian Country Media Network (ICMN) was owned by the Oneida Nation of New York until 2017; it included the Indian Country Today online newspaper. That year the OIN donated the news organization's assets to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI). The NCAI has continued to publish Indian Country Today online. OIN land litigation Since the 1970s, the OIN have been involved in several lawsuits involving real property. In the 70s, the OIN filed suit seeking recovery of the original land grant contained in the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua arguing the land was improperly transferred in violation of federal law and the US Constitution. As time progressed, the OIN began purchasing real property within this original grant as it became available. The OIN asserted its limited sovereignty status to claim the properties exempt from county and state property taxes. This culminated in several additional suits preceding the 2013 landmark agreement. =Land claim= In 1970 and 1974, the OIN, Oneida Nation of Wisconsin and the Oneida Nation of the Thames (Canada) filed lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York; they alleged that the reservation land granted to them by a treaty between the OIN and New York State was taken from the Oneida people (from their historic territory) and the treaty was never ratified by the Senate, making it unconstitutional. The state did not have authority under the US Constitution to deal directly with the Indian nations. The Oneida said that they still legally owned the lands in question. In 1970, the OIN filed a \\"test\\" case in federal court, suing Oneida and Madison counties for two years' rent (1968-1969) on county-owned acreage; the rent amounted to $16,694. The OIN argue that as the original action by the state was unconstitutional, they still owned the land and were owed rent by the counties. The United States District Court for the Northern District of New York dismissed the action, and the OIN appealed. On July 12, 1972, the Second Circuit United States Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s decision.464 F2d 916 The OIN petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to grant certiorari In Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida (1974), the Supreme Court decided in favor of the Oneida Indian Nation.414 US 661 [1974] On July 12, 1977, on remand to the District Court with Judge Edmund Port presiding, the Court sided with the OIN. The counties appealed to the Second Circuit, which affirmed Judge Port's decision. The counties had argued the OIN did not have standing for its claim, and the claim was too old and should not be considered.719 F2d 525 [1983] The counties petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of cert., which the court granted. On March 4, 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court found in favor of the OIN in a 5 to 4 vote.County of Oneida v Oneida Indian Nation, 470 US 226 (1985) The Court opined on three principles: * that the OIN had a common-law right to sue in federal courts; * that such claims were justiciable; and * there was no state or federal statute of limitations that would bar such claims. The majority opinion includes the following footnote: > \\"The question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief > available to the present day Oneida Indians was not addressed by the Court > of Appeals or presented to this Court by petitioners. Accordingly, we > express no opinion as to whether other considerations may be relevant to the > final disposition of this case should Congress not exercise its authority to > resolve these far-reaching Indian claims.\\" Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in his dissent: > \\"This decision upsets long-settled expectations in the ownership of real > property in the Counties of Oneida and Madison, New York, and the disruption > it is sure to cause will confirm the common law wisdom that ancient claims > are best left in repose. The Court, no doubt, believes that it is undoing a > grave historical injustice, but in so doing it has caused another, which > only Congress may now rectify.\\" In 1998, the United States Department of Justice intervened in the lawsuits on the plaintiff's behalf in order for the claim to proceed against New York State because the state asserted its immunity under the 11th Amendment. Based on City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation and Cayuga Indian Nation v New York, the Defendants moved for summary judgment.UCE motion, Upstate Citizens for Equality (UCE) On May 21, 2007, Judge Kahn dismissed the OIN's possessory land claims and allowed the non-possessory claims to proceed.Judge Kahn's decision, Upstate Citizens for Equality Both parties appealed Judge Kahn's decision. In a decision dated August 9, 2010, the Second Circuit opined that the non-possessory claims could not proceed and remanded the case back to the district court to enter a judgement in favor of the State and Counties. The OIN appealed to the US Supreme Court.\\"Oneidas to Appeal Claim Decision\\", Upstate Citizens for Equality =Status of former tribal lands re-acquired on the open market= Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman, Navy Adm. Edmund Giambastiani speaks with attendees of the Oneida Indian Nation veterans recognition ceremony in Verona, N.Y, November 4, 2006 The OIN has purchased lands which had been part of its historic reservation, as established by treaty with New York State. These had later been sold to the state and subsequently to non-Indians. For some time, the OIN and the state believed that the OIN's purchase of the land restored the property to its status as Indian Territory under Oneida possession. State law prohibits Class III gaming facilities. The OIN developed its resort and casino on what was understood to be its federal reservation, where that action was authorized under tribal sovereignty. The city of Sherrill challenged the OIN by trying to collect property taxes on the land the tribe bought in that jurisdiction, where it developed its casino. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation, US Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg determined that the land the casino is on was part of the original tribal lands.544 US 197 [2005] But, Justice Ginsburg held that although the land may be part of an ancient reservation land grant, as the OIN had not controlled it for more than 200 years, during which time it was non- Indian territory, the tribe could not re-establish its immunity (from state law) over those lands. To \\"re-establish sovereign authority\\" over ancient tribal lands which the Oneida had re-acquired on the open market, the U.S. Supreme Court said that the \\"proper avenue\\" for the Oneida Indian Nation was through § 465 of the Indian Reorganization Act. The OIN needed to apply to the Department of the Interior to place the disputed lands into federal trust.544 US 197, 217-221 [2005] Comments on the court decision varied. The issue in Sherrill was whether the city could levy property taxes on OIN's re-acquired tribal lands. The US Supreme Court determined that the City of Sherrill could levy property taxes. But the court failed to overturn the Second Circuit's finding that the land qualified as Indian Territory. OIN supporters argue that Sherrill stands only to say that the OIN cannot re-instate its tax immunity, but that the land is Indian Land. UCE and its supporters disagreed; they counter that the Sherrill ruling provided a blanket approval for the jurisdictions to foreclose on all OIN property that owe back taxes. Some UCE members interpreted the ruling as making the OIN casino operation illegal under state law, and speculated that it should be closed until the state and the OIN reach a new agreement on gaming. =Land trust application= In April 2005, the OIN applied to the Department of Interior to have this land taken into federal trust on its behalf. By letter dated June 10, 2005, Associate Deputy Secretary Cason advised Ray Halbritter, the tribe's lead on this issue, of its position: > \\"Department of Interior’s (\\"DOI\\") position with respect to certain issues > related to the status of OIN lands ... we do not agree with [the] assertion > that the Court’s ruling in Sherrill recognizes the continuation of > restriction on alienation protections over recently re-acquired lands ... it > is our opinion that Court in City of Sherrill unmistakably held that the > lands at issue (property interests purchased by OIN on the open market) are > subject to real property taxes. In the event these taxes are not paid, we > believe such lands are subject to foreclosure. Further, please be advised > that the BIA is in the process of taking appropriate action to clarify that > its recordation of OIN deeds does not have the legal effect of designating > these lands as restricted against alienation pursuant to 25 USC 177.\\" In order to accept the lands as federal trust property, the BIA had to prepare an environmental assessment of the action. On February 27, 2008, the BIA released its Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on taking the lands in question into trust on behalf of the OIN. It recommended that be placed into trust. After this announcement, the DOI gave a 30-day comment period and announced that it would have a decision on or after March 25, 2008.Final Environmental Impact Statement, Oneida Nation Trust Some government officials expressed concern about creating a \\"patchwork of taxable and tax-exempt properties,\\" making a \\"jurisdictional nightmare.\\" However, a sting operation conducted in conjunction with OIN Police and the Oneida County Sheriff disproved this argument.Prostitution Sting At Turning Stone Nets Three, Utica OD In opposing the OIN's land-into-trust application, New York State raised the question of whether the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) applies to the OIN, as the OIN had rejected reorganizing according to its rules, by a vote of 12 to 57 on June 17, 1936. According to the letter from Richard Platkin, Counsel to the Governor, to Franklin Keel, citing Michael T. Smith's Memorandum to Director, Office of Indian Services, Bureau of Indian Affairs, dated February 24, 1982, \\"the Oneida were considered not eligible, but in a reconsideration based on the discussion in the case of 'US v Boylan', the Department of Interior changed its position and conducted the referendum.\\" The OIN have noted that, as early as 1910, they have been a federally recognized tribe., pg 16 The OIN is part of the original Oneida tribe that was party to the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua. In unrelated cases involving other Indian tribes and whether the IRA applied to them, the BIA issued a ruling that the fact that a tribe conducted a vote related to reorganizing under the IRA, was sufficient to establish that an Indian Tribe was under federal jurisdiction in 1934. A 1980 BIA memorandum determined that the phrase \\"recognized tribe now under federal jurisdiction\\" includes tribes that existed in 1934 and had a continuing course of dealing with the United State or some other legal obligation. To this day, the United States honors its legal obligations to the OIN under the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua. Any flawed claim that the OIN is not a federally recognized tribe was unequivocally debunked in the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in 2016, where the Court affirmed, inter alia, that the OIN is an Indian Tribe within the meaning of the IRA.Upstate Citizens for Equality v. United States, No. 15-1688 (2d Cir. 2016) On December 23, 2013, the BIA issued an amendment to its 2008 record of decision, accepting 13,082 acres into federal trust. In that amendment, the BIA unequivocally determined that the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 is applicable to the OIN not only by virtue of the vote held, but also by the Boylan litigation, the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua, and the historical record. As noted below, New York State, and Oneida and Madison Counties have agreed to this decision's validity and discontinued any legal challenge, in perpetuity. On March 2008, County Executive Anthony Picente held a public meeting to discuss the possibility of negotiating a settlement before the March 25 deadline.Picente Seeks Compromise with Oneidas; for a copy of the transcript of that hearing, FOIL it from Oneida County Government page Congressman Arcuri tried to stall the decision by seeking to block such a settlement through legislation.\\"Nation Spokesman Says Arcuri's 'Secret' Legislation Is Discriminatory, Immoral\\", Upstate Citizens for Equality While criticized by both sides for killing any progress made between the two sides, Arcuri said he wanted to encourage negotiations. On January 2008, Halbritter sent a proposed settlement offer to the state and the county, but did not receive a response before DOI announced its decision. The OIN offered to negotiate an agreement pertaining to future trust applications, but the state and local governments have not responded. On May 20, 2008, the DOI announced that it would take into trust. The OIN offered to negotiate and settle the issues involved, while the state and county officials promised continued litigation. On or about June 17, 2008, two groups filed separate lawsuits in federal court challenging the DOI's decision.;\\"2 Suits Filed Opposing Land Into Trust Decision\\", UCEArticle re: suit, UCECopy of complaint: UCE, et al. v. United States , UCE UCE's suit challenges the DOI's authority to take the land into trust under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, alleging that this trust decision violates the United States Constitution. The other group alleges that the DOI's decision was arbitrary and capricious because some of the trust land is subject to outstanding litigation between the group and the OIN. On June 19, 2008 (the deadline to file suit), New York State, Oneida and Madison counties filed their suits in federal court.\\"State, counties file land-into-trust suit\\", UCE The state and county governments' arguments are similar to those of UCE. The opposing parties allege that the DOI's decision violates the United States constitution and that the DOI's decision was arbitrary. By letter dated January 7, 2009, Steven Miskinis, Esq. of the U.S. Department of Justice notified the Court that the U.S. has taken of land known as the former United States Air Force Space Command Complex at the Verona Research Facility, Germany Road, Verona, New York into trust for the OIN.Griffiss Air Force Base Trust Notice Two days later, the Assistant Attorney General for the State of New York objected to this action. He requested an expedited conference and asked that the United States voluntarily refrain from any further efforts to transfer land into trust for the OIN. Judge Kahn dismissed UCE's complaint, including the failed theory that the IRA is unconstitutional, on the basis of longstanding and settled law on this issue.\\"Judge dismisses citizen-group's claims\\" , Utica OD As detailed below, on May 16, 2013, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, Oneida County Executive Anthony Picente, Madison County Board of Supervisors Chairman John Becker, and Oneida Indian Nation leader Ray Halbritter announced a deal that settled all of their differences. Before the deal became effective, the majority of each government's legislative branches had to approve it.\\"Oneidas, State, and counties reach a revenue sharing deal\\", Utica ODCuomo Announces Landmark Agreement between State, Oneida Nation, and Oneida and Madison Counties\\", Governor of New York The key components of the agreement are as follows: # The OIN will pay 25% of its profits from its new slot machines to the state; # The State agrees to allow a maximum of to be placed into federal trust; # The OIN will have exclusive gaming rights within a 10-county region; # All pending litigation will be withdrawn; and # The OIN will charge its own sales tax on cigarettes and gas sales made to non-Indian purchasers, to be paid to the state. Of the 25% revenue that the state will receive, it will give half to the governments of Oneida and Madison counties.  Washington Redskins  In 2013, the OIN renewed a campaign to compel the Washington Redskins to change their team name and mascot. The OIN leader Halbritter launched the website \\"Change the Mascot.\\" On July 13, 2020, the Washington Redskins team ceded to public pressure and announced its decision to retire the team logo and change its name.Washington Resdkins retire team name  Issues  The OIN has both internal and external opposition. Internally, members of the Wolf Clan in particular protest Halbritter's assumption of power and dissolving of the traditional Oneida government, which was based on hereditary leaders for life. = Internal governance issues = Shenandoah v. United States DOI was a lawsuit that challenged the legitimacy and authority of Ray Halbritter to act on behalf of the OIN. Specifically, > \\"In 1977, members of the Oneida Nation appointed Halbritter and two other > Nation members as interim representatives of the Nation. On April 25, 1993, > the Grand Council, consisting of representatives from all six Iroquois > nations, including the Oneida Nation, purported to remove Halbritter from > his position as interim Nation representative.

Although informed of > Halbritter's alleged second removal, the Department had not acted upon that > notification by the time of oral argument, and as of the time of this > opinion, we have received no information to the contrary.\\" The district court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss both the non- habeas and habeas claims of the plaintiffs. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court. = External issues = External opposition comes from organizations such as Upstate Citizens for Equality (UCE), a group that opposed Haudenosaunee land claims in upstate New York. UCE also opposed the OIN being able to operate its enterprises tax-free on land it asserted sovereign status.(see Oneida Tribe) These issues were resolved by the 2013 landmark agreement. Tax issues Disputes have arisen with the state over the OIN's economic advantage of operating the Class III gaming facility without having to collect or pay state taxes on retail sales at the resort. The tribe does pay a portion of the revenues to the state under the gaming compact, (essentially in lieu of taxes). The OIN and other parties believed operations on property it controlled were tax free. City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation.544 US 197 [2005] Vernon Downs opened a casino to try to compete with Turning Stone. Prior to February 2008, the racino was heavily taxed under state law.Vernon to close after State Assembly Gaming Committee fails to pass tax reliefVernon Downs tax distribution Vernon Downs struggled to operate and, in late 2007, many of the original investors pulled out of the venture. The Upstate Citizens for Equality and supporters attributed to the OIN being able to operate its casino tax free. OIN supporters attribute Vernon Downs's troubles to the state collecting a total of 54% of the revenue in taxes (50% to the state education fund and 4% sales tax), making profitability difficult. On February 11, 2008, Director Steve Gural closed down the racino at Vernon Downs for three days.Vernon to re-open as tracks receive $90 million February 13, 2008, retrieved January 10, 2019 He was trying to make the state decrease its rate of taxation of the facility, to enable it to be more profitable.[8] This period of closure cost the state approximately $1.5 million in lost tax revenues. (The state has earmarked revenues from gambling for education, which was part of the original campaign to have voters approve the state's authorization of gaming activities.)[8] Many argued that the state should not call this \\"lost revenue.\\" Building the track created the revenue; without the track, there would be no revenue. The track was facing insolvency. The OIN asserted that it made up for this lack of land tax by donating to local schools in amounts that exceed the taxes which the county would normally receive from the land plots, in a program known as the Silver Covenant Chain Education Grants. As tensions increased between the various local governments, the state government, and the OIN, the OIN decreased or stopped the donations. Stockbridge Valley School has several OIN children as students, but the OIN has discontinued grants to the school because it disapproved of the views of one teacher.\\"School caught in Oneida Nation dispute\\", Indian Country Today [2004/01/24 In late fall 2003, an OIN representative contacted the Stockbridge Valley Community School District and advised that it would not make the Silver Covenant unless a particular teaching assistant was fired.R Richards , Madison County Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v Gould is a case brought on the issue of whether federally recognized Indian Tribes, such as the OIN, have to collect state sales taxes from retail sales to non-Indian consumers made within their reservation.14 NY3d 614 [2010] According to the Court of Appeals in Gould, the Indian Tribe is not subject to State tax law. For purposes of the State Tax Law, the Nation's retail operations on its lands, even if reacquired on the open market, are not subject to state tax law. =Potential pact between Oneida County and the OIN in 2009= On May 8, 2009, Anthony Picente, Oneida County Executive, announced a pact between Oneida County and the OIN.Picente Announces Agreement , WKTV The Oneida County Board of Legislators and the State legislature would have had to approve this pact within the next 60 days. If this pact had been approved, the OIN would have paid $55 million to Oneida County over the next 10 years, beginning with a $30 million lump sum payment the same year. Additionally, the OIN would have made make Silver Covenant Grants for the next five years, in order to apply for more trust land without county opposition. In return for this, the county would have agreed to drop its lawsuits and satisfy all pending tax lien and tax foreclosure proceedings. The OIN would have agreed to impose a sales tax on all businesses situated on its lands equal to Oneida County's sales tax rate. This OIN sales tax would have been imposed on all non-Indian patrons as well as tribal members. The pact would have required the Oneida County Sheriff and the OIN Police Department to negotiate a law enforcement pact to settle questions of jurisdictional authority and operations. On May 27, 2009, the County Board of Legislators rejected the proposed pact, citing many reasons for rejecting the proposed agreement. 2013 landmark agreement between New York State, Madison and Oneida Counties, and the OIN On May 16, 2013, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the OIN reached a settlement agreement between the state, and Oneida and Madison counties. The agreement resolved multiple legal issues between the parties. Pursuant to the agreement, the OIN would pay 25% of its revenue to the State, a quarter of which is paid to Oneida County and Madison County. These monies are to offset any property and sales taxes the Counties would otherwise receive if the property remained on the tax rolls. The State and Madison and Oneida counties agree to withdraw their objections to the OIN's land-trust application, with a cap of that can be transferred to the federal government. The OIN will have a 10-county (Oneida, Madison, Onondaga, Cayuga, Herkimer, Oswego, Cortland, Chenango, Otsego, and Lewis counties) geographic gambling monopoly. The OIN will implement a sales tax system to tax products sold to non-Indians on Indian Territory, such as cigarettes. And the agreement would terminate all related litigation between the OIN, the state, and Madison and Oneida Counties. This agreement required the State Legislature, the Oneida County and Madison County Boards of Legislators, the US Department of the Interior, and the Judiciary to ratify this agreement. On May 28, 2013, the Oneida County Board of Legislators approved the agreement in a 16-13 vote. On May 29, 2013, New York State, through Governor Cuomo, signed the agreement. On May 30, 2013, the Madison County Board of Supervisors approved the agreement in a weighted vote of 847-653. On January 1, 2014, the US Department of the Interior approved of the agreement. On June 22, 2013, both the state Senate (48-11) and the state Assembly (83-44) approved the agreement. The final entity to approve the agreement was the Judiciary. On March 4, 2014, US District Court Judge Kahn approved the settlement agreement. On September 4, 2014, the of OIN real property was formally transferred into US trust. On August 19, 2013, the Towns of Vernon and Verona jointly filed a lawsuit to oppose the ratified settlement, citing a violation of their freedom of speech and equal protection. On October 30, 2013, US District Court Judge Kahn remanded the lawsuit to the state court system because the towns lacked standing.

Mantu has also become popular in Peshawar due to Afghans living in the city and opening many food businesses since the 1990s. However, as of the 2010s, the number of restaurants that authentically prepare and serve the meal have decreased.https://www.destinationpak.com/blog/mamtu-a-cusine-from-gilgit- baltistan-recipe/ Manti are also consumed throughout Russia and other post- Soviet countries, where the dish spread from the Central Asian republics.More Than Just Another Dumpling , The School of Russian and Asian Studies, retrieved 25 January 2014 The dumplings typically consist of a spiced meat mixture, usually lamb or ground beef in a thin dough wrapper and either boiled or steamed. Size and shape vary significantly depending on the geographical location. Manti resemble the Chinese jiaozi and baozi, Korean mandu, Mongolian buuz and the Tibetan momo and the dish's name is cognate with the Korean mandu, Chinese mantou and Japanese manjū, although the modern Chinese and Japanese counterparts refer to different dishes.Hudgins 1997, pp. 142, 154. The name, depending on the language, can refer to a single dumpling or to more than one dumpling at a time; in English, it is often used as both a singular and plural form.  History  The origin is somewhat uncertain. While the Chinese word mantou has been suggested as the origin for the word manti, different Chinese characters have been used to address same food in the past which indicates the Chinese attempted to adapt a foreign word to their writing system. However, the term mantou (饅頭) already appears in early records of Jin dynasty (266CE-420CE), and similar foods were already produced and consumed in earlier periods. Different Chinese synonyms of the same foods such as manshou (饅首)\\" and zhengbing (蒸餅) were also already in use. Originally, mantou was meat-filled. Mantou still retains its old meaning of stuffed bun in Wu Chinese as moedeu. But in Mandarin and many other varieties of Chinese, mantou refers to plain steamed buns, while baozi resembles the ancient mantou stuffed with meat.http://www.fuchsiadunlop.com/dumpling-heaven-in-adelaide/ The dish may have originated in the territories of the Mongol Empire.https://vimeo.com/105120171 Some variations may be traced back to the Uyghur people of northwest China. One of the earliest mentions of manta is found in the 1330 manuscript Yinshan Zhengyao by Hu Sihui, a court therapist in service of the Yuan Dynasty Emperor, Buyantu Khan.Paul D. Buell, Eugene N. Anderson, tr., A Soup for the Qan: Chinese Dietary Medicine of the Mongol Era as Seen in Hu Szu-Hui's Yin-Shan Cheng-Yao: Introduction, Translation, Commentary and Chinese Text (London; New York: Kegan Paul International, 2000. ), p. 169. Uyghur-style manti with chili sauce on the side In general, there is agreement that the recipe was carried across Central Asia along the Silk Road to Anatolia by Turkic and Mongol peoples. According to Holly Chase, \\"Turkic and Mongol horsemen on the move are supposed to have carried frozen or dried manti, which could be quickly boiled over a camp-fire\\". According to an Armenian researcher, manti first reached Cilician Armenia as a result of the cultural interaction between Armenians and Mongols during their alliance in the 13th century.Irina Petrosian, David Underwood, Armenian Food: Fact, Fiction & Folklore. Lulu.com, 2006. Migrating Turkic-speaking peoples brought the dumpling with them to Anatolia, where it evolved into the Turkish mantı. When the Tatars settled into the Kayseri region of modern-day Turkey, the area became known for its manti. Korean mandu is also said to have arrived in Korea through the Mongols in the 14th century. Mandu at Doosan Encyclopedia However, some researchers do not discount the possibility that manti may have originated in the Middle East and spread eastward to China and Korea through the Silk Road. The earliest written Ottoman mantı recipe appears in a 15th- century cookbook written by Muhammed bin Mahmud Shirvani. The version in Shirvani's book is a steamed dumpling with a minced lamb and crushed chickpeas filling spiced with cinnamon and flavored with vinegar. The dish was garnished with sumac and like most contemporary mantı variations, it was served with a garlic-yoghurt sauce. Many early Turkish cookbooks do not mention a dish called mantı. The first printed recipe book, Melceüt\`t Tabâhhin, was published in 1844. It includes a recipe for a dish called Tatar böreği, which is similar to mantı but is not served with garlic yoghurt sauce. The first English- language Ottoman cookbook and a third cookbook printed in 1880 includes this same recipe. Another 1880 cookbook does have a recipe for mantı, but instead of a dumpling, it is a dish composed of layered dough served with mincemeat and garlic yogurt. This book also includes a recipe of piruhi, a cheese filled version of the Tatar böreği recipe.  In Central Asian cuisines  Manti in Central Asian cuisines are usually larger in size. They are steamed in a multi-level metal steamer called mantovarka, mantyshnitsa (Russian terms for manti cooker), manti-kazan or manti-kaskan (manti pot). It consists of layered pans with holes that are placed over a stock pot filled with water. Steaming is the main method of cooking manti; if boiled or fried, they are considered another type of dumpling, such as pelmeni. In Kazakh cuisine, the manti filling is normally ground lamb (sometimes beef or horse meat), spiced with black pepper, sometimes with the addition of chopped pumpkin or squash. This is considered to be a traditional Uyghur recipe. Manti are served topped with butter, sour cream or an onion sauce or garlic sauce. When sold as street food in Kazakhstan, manti are typically presented sprinkled with hot red pepper powder. In Uzbek, Tajik and Kyrgyz cuisines, manti are usually made of one (or a combination) of the following ingredients: lamb, beef, cabbage, potato or pumpkin, with fat often added to meat manti. Manti are usually topped with butter and may be served with sour cream, different types of ketchup, or freshly sliced onions (sprinkled with vinegar and black pepper). A sauce made by mixing vinegar and chilli powder is also common. In Uzbekistan, manti are also called kaskoni. The same style of cooking manti is traditional for Tatar, Bashkir and other cuisines of the Turkic peoples living in the vast area from Idel-Ural to the Far East. It is nowadays widespread throughout Russia and other post-Soviet countries. File:Manti 20100213 004.JPGMantovarka File:Uzbek Manti (bright).jpgUzbek manti File:Kawa manta.jpgManti filled with pumpkin  In Afghan cuisine  In Afghan cuisine, the thinly rolled out dough of the mantu are filled with beef or lamb mixed with minced onions and spices, steamed and then topped with a yoghurt-based sauce. The sauce (seer mosst, lit. \\"garlic yoghurt\\") is made with chaka (thick, creamy, strained and salted yoghurt), lemon juice, dried and fresh mint, green and red chili powder, and pressed garlic. The mantu can also be topped with a tomato-based sauce which can include split peas or red kidney beans and/or sautéed ground meat. This depends on the meat that was used for the filling of the mantu. The amount of yoghurt sauce is typically more than the tomato and ground meat sauce; the sauce is meant to be dotted on top as to not cover the entire dish. However, separate dishes containing more of the ground meat, split peas and tomato sauce and the yoghurt sauce may also be kept at the table or dastarkhān. Some Afghans also like to serve mantu with a carrot qorma or stew, instead of a tomato-based sauce. Now it is also famous in some areas of Pakistan due to Afghan refugees. The authentic Afghan mantu dumplings are supposed to be small and bite-sized. The dough is supposed to be thinned out so that it isn't chewy to bite on nor should one feel like they're eating more dough than filling. There's a specific pattern in which the dough of each dumpling is twisted and closed around the filling. There's a variation of this dish in Afghanistan known as Aushak, in which the filling is different and it's made by boiling the dumplings instead of steaming them. File:Mantu in a steamer.jpgAfghan mantu in a steamer before cooking File:Afghan dish of mantu.jpgAfghan dish of mantu  In Armenian and Turkish cuisines  In contrast to the Central Asian varieties, manti in Anatolia and Transcaucasia are usually boiled or baked rather than steamed and tend to be small in size. In modern Turkish cuisine, manti are typically served topped with yoghurt and garlic, and spiced with red pepper powder and melted butter, and topped with ground sumac and/or dried mint by the consumer. Similarly, the Armenian manti, also sometimes referred to as monta, are usually served with yoghurt (matzoon) or sour cream (ttvaser) and garlic, accompanied by clear soup (mantapour). Manti are more common among western (Cilician) Armenians, while among eastern Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis, similar dumplings called khinkali are more prevalent. A popular type of Turkish manti is known as Kayseri mantısı, originally from Kayseri, an Anatolian city. Kayseri mantısı is tiny and served with yoghurt, melted butter (flavored with Aleppo pepper) and seasoning including dry mint and Aleppo pepper flakes. It can also be served with the water or chicken broth it was boiled in, and often in Kayseri it is consumed as a soup prior to the main dish. In Kayseri, when a couple is engaged to be married, the mother of the groom visits the bride's house and during this visit the bride should prepare manti for her prospective mother-in-law. The smaller the manti dumplings are, the more skillful the bride is considered to be in the kitchen. Traditionally the dumplings prepared for the prospective mother-in law are supposed to be so small that 40 of them can be fit into one spoon. Manti may be made from shredded meat of quail, chicken or goose in some regions of Turkey, while boş mantı (\\"empty dumpling\\") lack filling entirely. Turkish cuisine includes also other dumplings similar to manti, such as hingel and Tatar böreği. These are typically larger than Kayseri mantısı. Similarly small dumplings are also found in other Turkic cuisines but they are not considered to be a type of manti. Examples are dushbara in Azerbaijani cuisine and chuchvara in Uzbek cuisine. File:Manti.jpgBaked Armenian manti File:Mantı in Çankaya - Ankara.jpgTurkish mantı with melted butter, garlic- yogurt sauce and Aleppo pepper File:Kayseri Mantısı.jpgTurkish woman preparing Kayseri mantısı on a tray  In Bosnian cuisine  In Bosnian cuisine, the name klepe or kulaci is used. These are made of minced meat with onions. It is served in a sauce consisting of yogurt and garlic. There is also a separate dish called mantije, which is made of the same ingredients, but the pastry balls are put together with no free space in between and baked. After the baking yogurt is poured on top. This second type is considered to be a pita or burek rather than manti, and is primarily made in the region of Sandžak.

The cartoon was simply called \\"Pitfall!\\". Pitfall! and Q*bert rotated weekly while the other three were weekly. During the second season, Q*bert (now weekly) and Donkey Kong remained while the Frogger, Donkey Kong Jr. and Pitfall! segments were replaced by shorts featuring: * Space Ace with Space Ace/Dexter (depending on his form), Kimberly, and Borf (from the Space Ace arcade game). * Kangaroo with friends and the \\"Monkey Business Gang\\" (from the Kangaroo arcade game).

With officer Kimberly (voiced by Nancy Cartwright), he works for Space Marshall Vaughn (voiced by Peter Renaday) to keep the peace in the universe. They fight the evil alien commander Borf (voiced by Arthur Burghardt) and keep him from invading Earth. Ace and Kim try to keep his 'wimping' situation secret and pretend that Dexter is Kim's little brother to Vaughn. Again, as with Donkey Kong, Ruby-Spears took artistic license; in the video game, Dexter had certain chances to revert to Ace, his full-grown self, whereas in the cartoon the Ace/Dexter phases seemed to happen on their own and often at inconvenient times for the hero. It was aired late night on Cartoon Network in the late 1990s, and segments have been shown between programs on Boomerang.

Each night, host David Letterman would present a list of ten items, compiled by his writing staff, that circulated around a common theme. The lists were usually given humorous topics such as, Top Ten Signs Your Kid Had A Bad First Day At School or, Top Ten Rejected James Bond Gadgets or based on current events. Letterman would also occasionally give an intentionally absurd and mundane category, such as Top Ten Numbers Between One and Ten, drawing humor from the silliness of ranking such mundane items.  Origin  Letterman's top ten skit was thought of when Steve O'Donnell was head writer of the Late Night with David Letterman show. According to O'Donnell, the Top Ten List was an \\"almost simultaneous inspiration arriving from staffers Jim Downey, Randy Cohen and Robert “Morty” Morton — largely prompted by the ridiculous 'eligible bachelor' lists in a local New York paper that included the 84-year-old Bill Paley. 'Why, we can put such nonsense together ourselves!' we exclaimed. And we did.\\" On September 18, 1985, the very first list, \\"The Top Ten Things That Almost Rhyme With Peas\\" was broadcast.  The switch from NBC to CBS  Before Letterman's departure for CBS, NBC had insisted that the \\"Top Ten List\\" was the intellectual property of the network, and demanded that it not be used on his new show; Letterman rebutted that the list was not NBC's property or even his own, since he had stolen the concept from elsewhere. A loose compromise was reached where it would be renamed the \\"Late Show Top Ten,\\" although Letterman would soon simply refer to it once again as the \\"Top Ten List,\\" with no repercussions. The only significant modifications in the Late Show years have been the elimination of mentioning a \\"home office\\" (such as Wahoo, Nebraska), and the addition of a computer-animated introduction and closing as well as background graphics.  Presentation  U.S. Army soldiers present a Top 10 List on the Late Show in June 2013.The entries are read by Letterman in reverse countdown order, and are accompanied by a drum roll performed by CBS Orchestra drummer Anton Fig. There are six montages: the pyramids, the athletes (usually used for a sports-themed top ten list), the taxi cabs, the water towers, the sewer covers, and, in time for the 2012 presidential campaign, the campaign trail. The conclusion of the list is then followed by a brief performance by the band, usually a pop song relating to the topic of the list in some way. Occasionally, the list is given by a guest presenter (such as John Malkovich reading \\"Ten Things That Sound Creepy When Said by John Malkovich\\" or Casey Kasem reading the recurring category \\"Top Ten Numbers Between One and Ten\\", or Dale Earnhardt \\"Top Ten Reasons It Took Me 20 Years To Win The Daytona 500\\"). At times, the list has also been given by a series of presenters, with each providing one entry; for example, the list for \\"Ten Things I've Always Wanted to Say to Dave\\", was used for Letterman's final show in 2015 and included entries from Alec Baldwin, Barbara Walters, Steve Martin, Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey, Chris Rock, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Peyton Manning, Tina Fey and Bill Murray. Four animated characters have recited a Top Ten list on the show: Homer Simpson (3 times), Peter Griffin, Stewie Griffin and Optimus Prime. Perhaps to break the monotony of a daily list, the show will occasionally add a twist to the presentation, sometimes by altering the nature of the list itself. One notable example occurred on November 27, 2001. Introduced as \\"Top Ten Ways Osama bin Laden Can Improve His Image,\\" the list consisted of only one entry: \\"#10. There's no way he can improve his image. He's a murdering, soul-less asshole.\\" A common source of confusion regarding the Top Ten List is why the #1 entry is usually seen as the least funny. This even inspired the Late Show to run a pre-taped bit in 1998, humorously exploring the apparent mystery, and to mention it again on December 29, 1999, when the list \\"Top Ten Phrases That Were Not Spoken This Millennium,\\" included the #1 entry of, \\"Why is the number one always so damn funny?\\" Writer Bill Scheft confirmed this in a 2007 interview on Costas on the Radio, stating that the writers use the three funniest entries on #10 (to start the list strong), #6, (which usually accompanies an on-screen slide change), and #2 (the last opportunity for a laugh before the completion of the bit).

Radio usage For nearly two decades each Top Ten list was packaged into a nationally syndicated radio feature, distributed by Westwood One for use the following morning. Following shows from which the list was omitted, or if Letterman was on vacation, the feature would utilize a list from the archives. The feature was often edited for time, and occasionally edited for content which may have been appropriate for late-night TV, but not morning radio. In late 2013 Westwood One informed \\"Top 10\\" affiliates that it was ceasing distribution of the feature. The last Top 10 list for radio aired Friday, January 3, 2014. No other radio network picked up the feature for the rest of the TV show's run. In popular culture The television cartoon Garfield & Friends referenced the feature with an episode entitled Top Ten, where Garfield presents Top Ten lists on various topics ranging from \\"How to Tell When Garfield is Full,\\" and \\"Why Jon Arbuckle Will Never Have a Date,\\" to \\"Why the House will Never Get Robbed.\\" The Buddy Bears provide the accompanying music.

These units are generally separate from a nation's dedicated air force, and usually comprise helicopters and light support fixed-wing aircraft. Prior to the establishment of separate national air forces, many armies had military aviation units, which as the importance of aviation increased, were spun off into independent services. As the separation between a nation's army and air force led to a divergence of priorities, many armies sought to re-establish their own aviation branches to best serve their own organic tactical needs. History Military aviation first began as either army or naval aviation units established as force multipliers to allow armies and navies to better do what they were already doing, this taking mostly the form of reconnaissance and artillery spotting, this led to the first fighter aircraft whose purpose was to shoot down enemy reconnaissance and artillery spotting aircraft, and to protect one's own aircraft from being shot down. At this point the purpose of aircraft was still to act as an adjunct to traditional armies and fleets operating in the traditional way. However, as aircraft became more technologically sophisticated military theorists of the interwar period began to think of airpower as a means in and of itself where the critical blow could be delivered by strategic bombing, and the experience of World War II confirmed this. Post World War II air forces such as the Royal Air Force and the newly established United States Air Force concentrated on building strategic bomber forces for attack and fighter forces to defend against enemy bombers. Air forces still incorporated a significant amount of tactical missions through air interdiction and close air support missions. In order to acquire a close air support capability armies sought to expand, establish or re-establish their own tactical aviation branches, which are usually composed of helicopters, rather than fixed-wing aircraft. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicles some armies have begun to use small battlefield UAVs, not attached to army aviation units, but rather directly attached to artillery battalions as spotters, and with the smallest and lightest drones being deployed by individual infantry platoons to provide real time local reconnaissance.

These helicopters can be classified into the following categories: *Attack helicopters for close air support of ground troops and anti-tank role *Transport helicopters *Observation helicopters *Utility helicopters *CSAR, Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC)/MEDEVAC helicopters *Training helicopters In addition to helicopters, some armies also operate fixed-wing aircraft for tactical reconnaissance.

It connects Baseline Road to Heron Road and allows east-west traffic to cross both the Rideau River and the Rideau Canal just south of Carleton University. The current bridge was finished in 1967, one year after a bridge collapse killed nine workers and injured over sixty others in the worst construction accident in both Ottawa and Ontario history. It was renamed in 2016 to commemorate the victims of that accident.  Planning and early construction  Ottawa Mayor Charlotte Whitton initially opposed the plans of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker to build the bridge to ease east-west traffic in the city. In 1961, Diefenbaker's government threatened to reduce the amount of federal grants to Ottawa by the cost of the bridge if the city did not agree to build it. After further negotiations, an agreement on building the bridge was signed by the municipal, provincial, and federal governments in 1964. The original construction plan included two three-lane, bridges, one eastbound and one westbound, and was budgeted at two and a half million dollars. The bridge was slightly north of Hog's Back Falls and was to connect Baseline Road and Heron Road over the Rideau River and the Rideau Canal for both motorists and pedestrians. The City of Ottawa awarded the contract to build the footings of the concrete piers supporting the bridge to Beaver Construction in February 1965. This work was completed by June 1965. The final plan for the project still had two three- lane bridges, but the prestressed concrete bridges would only be 877.5 feet long. In August 1965, the city awarded the bridge construction contract to O.J. Gaffney Ltd and hired M.M. Dillon & Company Ltd as consulting engineers for designing and supervising the project. Each bridge had four spans, for which the concrete was poured in two layers. Work started in fall 1965 on the western spans, which were was mostly finished by August 1966. Meanwhile wooden falsework was used to support the less complete eastern spans still being built. The first concrete layer for the third of both bridges' four spans had been poured back in July 1966 without issue. August 10, 1966 collapse On August 10, 1966, a shift of about sixty to seventy workers were almost finished pouring of concrete on the eastern side of the partially completed third span of the southern bridge when it collapsed at 3:27 p.m. According to an eyewitness account from a M.M. Dillon manager, the crew had been pouring concrete eastwards from the centre of the span when the western end of the span was flipped upwards and onto the rest of the bridge, bringing it down. The wooden falsework on the bridge failed and workers on the bridge fell between fifteen and twenty metres to the ground, while rebars, cement, wood, concrete, and other building materials fell on them. The collapse created a loud impact noise and a cloud of dust. It also triggered the nearby Dominion Observatory's seismometer, which prompted officials to issue a statement that the collapse had not been caused by an earthquake. Many workers panicked and ran or swam away from the site right after the collapse, while others ran to the site to help the victims. People picnicking in nearby Vincent Massey Park arrived on the scene to help shortly before emergency services did. Ottawa mayor Don Reid also came to the scene and joined in the rescue efforts with a pair of bolt cutters. Most of the injured were taken to the Civic Hospital, which was in the middle of switching from day to night shifts, allowing many medical staff to stay and deal with the influx of patients or to travel to the site to provide aid such as administering morphine to trapped workers. The high number of patients forced the hospital to cancel all elective procedures and relocate patients in wings adjacent to the emergency room so the injured construction workers could be kept together. Because many of the injured were recently arrived Europeans who were not fluent in English, were not carrying their identification at the time of the accident, and were covered in concrete, many blood transfusions were done without having a patient name, contrary to standard operating procedure. Over one third of the 183 workers were treated at the Civic Hospital, while the Ottawa General Hospital and the National Defence Medical Centre received just two patients each. The surgeon of the General Hospital criticized the focus on sending patients to the overwhelmed, but nearby Civic Hospital, when his hospital only received their first patient at 4:30 p.m. despite having its staff on standby in anticipation of a patient influx. Rescue efforts ended at 3:30 a.m. when it became too dark to continue using the required machinery. Nine men died as a result of the collapse: seven were killed on site, one died at the Civic Hospital, and another died from his injuries in September. Over sixty workers were injured, mostly from the falling wet cement that had just been poured on the bridge when it collapsed. Among the dead were Leonard Baird, the project's resident engineer, and Clarence Beattie, the site foreman; the other seven workers who died were Jean Paul Guerin, Omer Lamadeleine, Edmund Newton, Lucien Regimbald, Dominic Romano, Raymond Tremblay, and Joao Viegas. The accident remains the deadliest construction accident in both Ottawa and Ontario history. = Inquest and aftermath = A inquest into the collapse was completed in November 1966 after a week of testimony from over seventy witnesses. The total cost for the inquest was $100,000. It was led by Ontario coroner H.B. Cotnam, who retained the engineering firm H.G. Acres Ltd to help conduct the investigation. Officially, the inquest was into the causes of death for site foreman Clarence Beattie. The inquest blamed the lack of proper diagonal bracing on the wooden falsework supporting the concrete. University of Toronto engineering department head Carson Morrison gave expert evidence using wooden models to show flaws in the unbraced falsework's design. The inquest found that the weight of even one layer of concrete being placed to form the bridge deck exceeded the weight that the supports could hold, and that a second collapse was imminent as supports near the collapsed area showed signs of buckling. Secondary contributing factors included the use of green lumber, which was weaker than mature wood, differences between how the footings settled, and temporary overload of some of the posts. The inquest heard testimony that a third design for the falsework, which did not include diagonal bracing, was meant by the consulting engineers to supplement the previous design, which did have the bracing. However it was interpreted by the construction firm as being a complete and final design. There was conflicting evidence about who was responsible for the change to remove the bracing from the design, with the Gaffney construction firm blaming M.M. Dillon, their engineering consultants, who denied they were responsible. Furthermore, municipal and provincial safety inspectors noticed the lack of diagonal bracing but were reassured by the engineering student leading the inspection tour that it had been approved by qualified engineers. Because the inspectors were not trained engineers and had been told not to question qualified engineers, the lack of bracing was not reported. Oliver Gaffney, the owner and namesake of the construction firm building the bridge, accepted only partial responsibility for the falsework's design and construction, arguing that the design and method of construction had been approved by M.M Dillon, their design consulting engineering firm. John Bromley, the project engineer at Dillon in charge of approving the falsework design, testified that the fault for not recognizing the fatal lack of diagonal bracing was his alone and said that \\"My mind must have been a bit confused at the time.\\" The inquest found that O.J. Gaffney Ltd. of Stratford, Ontario, and M.M Dillon Co. were both responsible for the bridge collapse. O.J. Gaffney Ltd. was found guilty on two charges and fined $5,000, the maximum allowed penalty under the existing Construction Safety Act. As a result of the findings, the Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario suspended two of its members, including Bromley, for one year and reprimanded a third. The inquest jury also made a series of recommendations to prevent future accidents of this type. These included clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of construction firms and engineering consultants, stricter training and reporting requirements for inspectors, and requirements that falsework designs be stamped by a qualified engineer and use appropriate lumber. It also recommended creating a mandatory provincial building code for falsework and bridge construction. The recommendations of the inquest prompted a rewrite of the Construction Safety Act to increase workplace safety standards. Widows of those killed in the accident received a lump sum payout of $300 to cover the cost of a funeral, an allowance of $75 per month, and $40-$50 per month for each child still in school. The bridge was rebuilt and opened to the public on June 29, 1967.  Later history  In November 1987, a plaque honouring the nine workers killed was placed just west of the bridge on Heron Road. In the same year, the Canadian Labour Congress built a monument in nearby Vincent Massey Park to Canadians killed and injured at work. From February 2011 to October 2012, Heron Road Bridge was closed because of a $15 million rehabilitation project — part of the city's Ottawa on the Move infrastructure plan — that improved its bearings, expansion joints, and pavement, among other changes. In July 2016, after a campaign by the Ottawa and District Labour Council, the Ottawa City Council voted to rename the bridge the Heron Road Workers Memorial Bridge to honour the victims of the collapse. A rededication ceremony was held at the aforementioned plaque on August 10, 2016, the fiftieth anniversary of the collapse, and included three workers who survived the collapse, Mayor Jim Watson, the president of the Ottawa and District Labour Council, as well as the relatives of the victims. A new plaque was unveiled at the event.

The total area of the national forest is 141,864 acres, or 222 sq miles (574 km2). The forest is managed by the U.S. Forest Service's Nebraska Forests and Grasslands Supervisor's Office in Chadron, Nebraska. The national forest includes two ranger districts, the Bessey Ranger District and the Pine Ridge Ranger District. In descending order of land, the forest lies in parts of Thomas, Dawes, Blaine, and Sioux counties. History Nebraska National Forest was established on November 15, 1907 by the consolidation of three smaller forests: Dismal River, Niobrara and North Platte National Forests. At one point it was the largest man-made forest in the world, but has been surpassed by a forest in China.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/23/china-great-green- wall-climate The urban forest of Johannesburg, South Africa is often cited as the largest man-made forest, but is only the largest urban forest.https://africacheck.org/reports/is-johannesburg-the-worlds-largest-man- made-forest-the-claim-is-false/ Bessey Ranger District The Bessey Ranger District is in the Sandhills of central Nebraska. Encompassing about 63.9% of the forest's total area, it lies in parts of Thomas and Blaine counties. It was established in 1902 by Charles E. Bessey because he believed the area to have once had a natural forest and as an experiment to see if forests could be recreated in treeless areas of the Great Plains for use as a national timber reserve. This effort resulted in a forest, the largest human-planted forest in the United States. Today the forest's nursery supplies 2.5 to 3 million seedlings per year. The Bessey Tree Nursery is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. There is a local ranger district office in Halsey. Pine Ridge Ranger District The Pine Ridge Ranger District is in the Pine Ridge region of northwest Nebraska. It contains about 36.1% of the forest's total area, and it lies in part of Dawes and Sioux counties. The native ponderosa forests were added to the National Forest system in the 1950s. The Soldier Creek Wilderness, a federally designated wilderness area, is in the forest. The 6,600-acre Pine Ridge National Recreation Area is located within the ranger district.

History After years as a freelancer and comics art packager (with his company Continuity Associates), in 1984 Adams ventured into publishing as a way to maximize his creative freedom (and profits). Continuity mainly published a variety of superhero comics developed by Adams. (For instance, the title Ms. Mystic was first published by Pacific Comics, and was revived in 1987 by Continuity.) Adams' own detailed, realistic art was the basis of Continuity's \\"house style\\"; the company's creators included Dan Barry, Vicente Alcazar, Mike Deodato, Jr., Mark Texeira, Dave Hoover, Richard Bennett, Tom Grindberg, Bart Sears, Esteban Maroto, and Michael Netzer. Adams often provided layouts for the company's titles, as well as inking many faces and contributing other personal touch-up artwork. Adams also plotted many of Continuity's titles, most of which were scripted by writer Peter Stone. Continuity's comics tended to be grittier than the mainstream Marvel or DC comics of their day, often depicting bloody, graphic violence. For instance, in one issue of Armor the title character has his hand chopped off and then the appendage is destroyed in a blender. Continuity was also part of a trend towards more eroticism in mainstream comics. For instance, the costume and the cover artwork for the character Samuree were often revealing, and she was sometimes drawn in sexy poses on the cover of her comic. During the 1990s \\"variant cover\\" craze, Continuity got into Tyvek (marketed as \\"indestructible\\"), die-cut, glow-in-the-dark, chrome-plated, and hologram covers; as well as pull-out posters, stickers, and trading cards; all of which are associated with the speculation bubble which burst in the mid-1990s. Continuity also bought into the crossover craze of the era with Deathwatch 2000 and Rise of Magic). Continuity's entire line was canceled during the Rise of Magic crossover in 1993. Over the course of its life as a publisher, Continuity was the subject of much criticism from comics retailers and fans for poor editorial oversight and the publisher's inability to ship its products on time or according to schedule.Hibbs, Brian. \\"Tilting at Windwills\\" #23, Comix Experience (March 1994).

Life Miller was raised in New York's Mohawk Valley, which led to a lifelong interest in the Iroquois Indians. He pursued this as an amateur archaeologist and a member of the New York State Archaeological Association. He received his M.S. in chemistry from Union College in Schenectady. He subsequently worked as a technical writer for General Electric in the 1940s, and for the Fisher Scientific Company in Pittsburgh from 1952 until his death. Miller died October 13, 1974 on Blennerhassett Island, West Virginia. He was on an archaeological tour to the \\"Fort Ancient culture\\" site west of Parkersburg at the time. Works Miller wrote pulp science fiction beginning in the 1930s, and is considered one of the more popular authors of the period. His work appeared in such magazines as Amazing Stories, Astounding, Comet, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Marvel Tales, Science Fiction Digest, Super Science Stories, Unknown, Weird Tales, and Wonder Stories, among others. An active fan of others' work as well as an author, he is also known as an early bibliographer of Robert E. Howard's \\"Conan\\" stories in the 1930s, together with his friend John D. Clark. = Clark and Conan = Clark first encountered Robert E. Howard's fantasies of Kull, Conan and Solomon Kane in the magazine Weird Tales. He became an avid fan, and together with Miller he worked out an outline of Conan's career and a map of the world in Howard's invented Hyborian Age in early 1936 from the then-published stories. Miller sent this material to Howard, whose reply confirmed and corrected their findings. Their map became the basis of those that later appeared in the book editions of the Conan stories.De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"John D. (\\"Doc\\") Clark\\" (obituary) in Locus, August 1988, pages 64-65. Their revised outline, \\"A Probable Outline of Conan's Career\\" was published in the fanzine The Hyborian Age in 1938. Thus established as an authority on Conan, Clark was invited to edit and provide introductions for the first book editions of Howard's Conan stories, published by Gnome Press in the 1950s. Expanded versions of his and Miller's essay on Conan, retitled \\"An Informal Biography of Conan the Cimmerian\\", appeared in the Gnome volume The Coming of Conan in 1953 and (revised by de Camp) in the fanzine Amra, vol. 2, no. 4, in 1959. It was the source of the linking passages between the individual Conan stories in both the Gnome editions and the Lancer paperback editions of the 1960s. Clark and Miller's Hyborian Age map, together with Howard's own original, are the basis of those published in the Gnome, Lancer, and later editions of the stories. Miller gradually shifted into book reviewing beginning in 1945, initially for Astounding Science Fiction and later for its successor, Analog. He began a regularly monthly review column in the former in October, 1951. As a critic he was notable for his enthusiasm for a wide coverage of the science fiction field. He was awarded a special Hugo Award for book reviews in 1963. After his death his sister Mary E. Drake donated his extensive collection of papers, maps, books and periodicals, accumulated largely as a result of his review work, to the Carnegie Museum. They now form the basis of the P. Schuyler Miller Memorial Library at the Edward O'Neill Research Center in Pittsburgh.

Likewise its influence can still be felt to this day.Harper, Jim. Flowers from Hell: The Modern Japanese Horror Film. Noir Publishing. () Overview The work is a re-imagining of the 20th century of Tokyo as influenced by the occult. Most of the subject matter builds upon references to classic Japanese and Chinese folklore, although the centerpiece of the mythology is the legend of Taira no Masakado, a 10th-century warlord and ferocious onryo who was placated into a guardian kami through centuries of worship. The plot features many characters, both historical and fictional. Most of the narrative revolves around the cryptohistorical actions of Yasunori Katō, a mysterious former lieutenant of the Imperial Japanese Army who is himself a vengeful oni; a descendant of the people who rebelled against the Japanese Empire in ancient times. With an incredible knowledge of the supernatural and allies in China, Korea and Taiwan; Katō dedicates his life to crippling Tokyo, the seat of power of the modern Japanese Empire. His ruinous ambitions bring him into conflict with some of 20th century Japan's greatest minds including industrialist Eiichi Shibusawa, onmyoji Abe no Seimei's descendant Yasumasa Hirai, authors Koda Rohan and Izumi Kyoka; physicist Torahiko Terada, and author Yukio Mishima. The resulting conflict, involving science, magic and politics; spans 90 years of Japan's history. The story begins near the end of the Meiji period and ranges through the rest of the century. It reinvents major events such as the Great Kantō earthquake, the founding of Japan's first subway, the February 26 Incident, the firebombing raids, the signing of the 1960 US Security Pact, and the ritual suicide of Yukio Mishima. The narrative finally reaches its climax in 1998, the 73rd year of a fictional Shōwa period.

He was asked by the editor in chief of Kadokawa Shoten, Hiroshi Morinaga, to produce a fantasy themed work for their periodical Monthly King Novel. At that time, Aramata had never written a fictional novel before. The initial idea for the story came from the legend of Taira no Masakado. Aramata was fascinated by the legacy of his spirit and its superstitious impact on modern Japan.Fuji TV \\"Odessa of stairs\\" <2013.02> In addition, while participating in the creation of Heibonsha World Encyclopedia, Hiroshi Aramata was inspired by discussions with anthropologist Komatsu Kazuhiko about sources of the strange and the mysterious in Japanese folklore.Reider, Noriko T. Japanese Demon Lore: Oni from Ancient Times to the Present. Utah State University Press, 2010. 117.

Retrieved on 2012-8-07. Many of these topics are taken for granted in contemporary fantasy media. The novel also contributed to a surge of mainstream interest in feng shui across Japan.Shūkyō Kenkyūkai, Japanese Journal of Religious Studies, Volume 74, Issues 324-327, Pg. 273, University of Michigan, 2000 Baku Yumemakura, widely regarded author of the bestselling Onmyoji novel and manga series, has often cited Teito Monogatari as a significant inspiration and credits it with the beginning of the Abe no Seimei/onmyoji boom in popular media.Rechio, Devin T. \\"Constructing Abe no Seimei: Integrating Genre and Disparate Narratives in Yumemakura Baku's Onmyoji\\". University of Massachusetts-Amherst. Masters Theses. May 2014 Other similarly themed franchises which emerged in the wake of the novel's success include Clamp's Tokyo Babylon manga series, and Natsuhiko Kyogoku's Kyōgokudō (京極堂) series. Professor of Human Geography Paul Waley cites Teito Monogatari as a catalyst for reminding a generation of Japanese readers about Tokyo's former status as an Imperial Capital.Waley, Paul. Japanese Capitals in Historical Perspective: Place, Power and Memory in Kyoto, Edo and Tokyo. Routledge, January 6, 2003. page 245. () Dr. Noriko T. Reider, associate professor of Japanese Studies at Miami University, credits Teito Monogatari with raising \\"the oni's status and popularity greatly in modern times\\".Reider, Noriko T. \\"Oni and Japanese Identity\\". Utah State University Press, 2010. In 2009 Higashi Masao, a notable authority in the field of Japanese weird fiction, wrote an article entitled \\"The Impact of Teito Monogatari\\" where he discussed the novel's influence on contemporary Japanese supernatural fiction.Masao, Higashi. \\"A Mammoth Story which Leads Reality: The Impact of TEITO MONOGATARI\\", KWAI Magazine, vol. 23 Akira Okawada, a specialist in Japanese science fiction literature, wrote a similar article in 2010 discussing the work's influence on that respective genre.Okawada, Akira. \\"The Comprehensive Tokyo Related Science Fiction\\", S-F Magazine, September 2010, Hayakawa Shoubo Analysis In her essay \\"Oni and Japanese Identity\\", Dr. Noriko T. Reider argues that the work is a heterotopic inversion of classical oni mythology heavily influenced by the supernatural configuration brought about by World War II. She describes the novel as a \\"...heterotopic site where...contemporary representations of oni reflect past representations, where oni of the past are not simply superimposed upon the present but both act as extensions of each other in an odd continuum\\". The character of Yasunori Kato is intended as a homage to classic heroes from Japanese folklore such as Minamoto no Raiko (an imperial soldier related to oni) and Abe no Seimei. Whereas those heroes were ardent defenders and valuable servants of the Empire though, Kato is presented as its worst possible enemy. This inversion is also reflected in the character of Taira no Masakado, whom at the beginning is demonized by the narrator and the Japanese government as a national rebel and a threat. However, the story unfolds with him in the role of Tokyo's benevolent guardian deity worshiped by the various protectors of the city. The negative association becomes a positive one. Another example is found in the novel's fictional version of Emperor Hirohito. In pre-war Japanese culture, the Emperor was regarded as a divine figure incapable of human failing. In Teito Monogatari however, the Showa Emperor is presented as a frail figure who prolongs his life by unwittingly ingesting a nostrum made from human organs. This practice of cannibalism effectively puts him on the level of oni, a major paradox since the Emperor's divine status and the status of oni are incompatible with each other. If even the Emperor of Japan has the potential to become an oni, then when is an oni not an oni? Spin-offs and prequels *The series: Published 1993–2001.

Mildred brazenly follows Mary Alice home, demanding a dollar---but Grandma Dowdel turns the tables on the tyrant, slyly untying Mildred's horse. Faced with a barefoot 5-mile-hike home, Mildred loses interest in making trouble for Mary Alice. October brings plenty of other trouble, however, when another teen hooligan - August Fluke Jr. - gets in the habit of knocking down privies for pre- Halloween amusement. With the help of a strategically strung wire and a pan of glue, Grandma Dowdel trips up Augie's trickery, with a hot coat of glue that sticks \\"till kingdom come.\\" Luckily, Grandma's treats prove far sweeter than her tricks: at the party, Mrs. Dowdel dishes up home-baked pies made with borrowed pecans and pumpkins. Moonlit winter nights find Grandma and Mary Alice trapping foxes; with the extra money, Grandma buys Joey a train ticket and he arrives just in time for the Christmas pageant. But when Mildred Burdick's illegitimate baby turns up in the manger, Christmas is anything but a silent night. Mary Alice stirs the town up by submitting anonymous articles to a community newspaper and a new boy---Royce McNabb---arrives just in time for Valentine's Day. Carleen develops an instant crush on Royce. With the help of best friend Ina-Rae, Mary Alice fools Carleen into believing that Royce sent Ina-Rae a valentine. Meanwhile, Grandma hosts a tea for the Daughters of the American Revolution and country bumpkin Effie Wilcox learns that the hoity-toity Mrs. L.J. Weidenbach is her long-lost sister. In spring, Grandma takes in a New York artist, Arnold Green, as a boarder for a whopping $2.50 a day as Mary Alice invites Royce over for an ostensibly \\"study\\" focused-date. The snake Grandma keeps in the attic drops down on Maxine Patch, the postmistress, whom Green was painting naked, or nude, as he prefers, leaving Maxine shamed (as she ran through town au naturel) and Arnold in shock. Grandma moonlights as matchmaker, introducing Green to Mary Alice's English teacher, Miss Butler. Mary Alice survives her first tornado, and the school year wraps up with a hayride that finds Royce and Mary Alice promising to exchange letters. A year down yonder leaves Mary Alice with a more tenderhearted view of country life and Grandma Dowdel, and she hesitates to head back to Chicago. Wedding bells ring at the end of World War II, and Mary Alice returns to marry Royce McNabb in Grandma's front room. Reception According to Kirkus Reviews, \\"Peck's slice-of-life novel doesn't have much in the way of a sustained plot; it could almost be a series of short stories strung together, but the narrative never flags, and the book, populated with distinctive, soulful characters who run the gamut from crazy to conventional, holds the reader's interest throughout.\\" Jim Gladstone wrote in The New York Times, \\"I suspect that parents and grandparents will enjoy reading these conversationally cadenced stories aloud, savoring Peck's sweet (but never too sentimental) evocations of, say, Kate Smith, 'the Songbird of the South,' singing; Armistice Day celebrations; W.P.A. artists' post office projects; and the joys of eavesdropping on faraway places through a portable radio in the dark of night.\\" Kitty Flynn wrote in The Horn Book Magazine, \\"While the escapades are diverting, the seven stories, which span the school year, don't have the cumulative power of those in A Long Way from Chicago... Peck presents memorable characters in a satisfying sequel, and those looking to be entertained once again by Grandma Dowdel will enjoy their visit.\\"Kitty Flynn, The Horn Book Magazine, cited in Jaquan Jarrett wrote in The Yellow Wolf Magazine, \\"A unique approach to children's literature... a modern day children's book that is based on a time period we all enjoy reading about, rather than submitting to modern-day approaches with sci-fi and dragons\\". 2016  References  2000 American novels Children's historical novels American children's novels Newbery Medal-winning works Sequel novels Novels set in Illinois Great Depression novels Fiction set in 1937 2000 children's books ","title":"A Year Down Yonder"},{"id":"2827226","text":"Arbiters are electronic devices that allocate access to shared resources.  Bus arbiter  A bus arbiter is a device used in a multi-master bus system to decide which bus master will be allowed to control the bus for each bus cycle. The most common kind of bus arbiter is the memory arbiter in a system bus system. A memory arbiter is a device used in a shared memory system to decide, for each memory cycle, which CPU will be allowed to access that shared memory. Michael Fingeroff. \\"High-Level Synthesis Blue Book\\". 2010. p. 270. quote: \\"The bus or memory arbiter processes the request from the different processes and decides who gets access to the bus/memory.\\" Arten Esa, Bryan Myers. \\"Design of an Arbiter for DDR3 Memory\\". 2013. Kearney, D.A.; Veldman, G. \\"A concurrent multi-bank memory arbiter for dynamic IP cores using idle skip round robin\\". 2003. DOI: 10.1109/FPT.2003.1275789. Some atomic instructions depend on the arbiter to prevent other CPUs from reading memory \\"halfway through\\" atomic read-modify-write instructions. A memory arbiter is typically integrated into the memory controller/DMA controller. Some systems, such as conventional PCI, have a single centralized bus arbitration device that one can point to as \\"the\\" bus arbiter. Other systems use decentralized bus arbitration, where all the devices cooperate to decide who goes next. Tim Downey. \\"Bus Arbitration\\" Shun Yan Cheung. \\"Bus Arbitration\\" When every CPU connected to the memory arbiter has synchronized memory access cycles, the memory arbiter can be designed as a synchronous arbiter. Otherwise the memory arbiter must be designed as an asynchronous arbiter. Asynchronous arbiters An important form of arbiter is used in asynchronous circuits to select the order of access to a shared resource among asynchronous requests. Its function is to prevent two operations from occurring at once when they should not. For example, in a computer that has multiple CPUs or other devices accessing computer memory, and has more than one clock, the possibility exists that requests from two unsynchronized sources could come in at nearly the same time. \\"Nearly\\" can be very close in time, in the sub-femtosecond range. The memory arbiter must then decide which request to service first. Unfortunately, it is not possible to do this in a fixed time [Anderson 1991]. Ivan Sutherland and Jo Ebergen, in their article \\"Computers without Clocks\\", describe Arbiters as follows: : \\"An Arbiter is like a traffic officer at an intersection who decides which car may pass through next. Given only one request, an Arbiter promptly permits the corresponding action, delaying any second request until the first action is completed. When an Arbiter gets two requests at once, it must decide which request to grant first. For example, when two processors request access to a shared memory at approximately the same time, the Arbiter puts the requests into a sequence, granting access to only one processor at a time. The Arbiter guarantees that there are never two actions under way at once, just as the traffic officer prevents accidents by ensuring that there are never two cars passing through the intersection on a collision course.\\" : \\"Although Arbiter circuits never grant more than one request at a time, there is no way to build an Arbiter that will always reach a decision within a fixed time limit. Present-day Arbiters reach decisions very quickly on average, usually within about a few hundred picoseconds. [...] When faced with close calls, however, the circuits may occasionally take twice as long, and in very rare cases the time needed to make a decision may be 10 times as long as normal.\\" =Asynchronous arbiters and metastability= Arbiters break ties. Like a flip-flop circuit, an arbiter has two stable states corresponding to the two choices. If two requests arrive at an arbiter within a few picoseconds (today, femtoseconds) of each other, the circuit may become meta-stable before reaching one of its stable states to break the tie. Classical arbiters are specially designed not to oscillate wildly when meta-stable and to decay from a meta-stability as rapidly as possible, typically by using extra power. The probability of not having reached a stable state decreases exponentially with time after inputs have been provided. A reliable solution to this problem was found in the mid-1970s. Although an arbiter that makes a decision in a fixed time is not possible, one that sometimes takes a little longer in the hard case (close calls) can be made to work. It is necessary to use a multistage synchronization circuit that detects that the arbiter has not yet settled into a stable state. The arbiter then delays processing until a stable state has been achieved. In theory, the arbiter can take an arbitrarily long time to settle, but in practice, it seldom takes more than a few gate delay times. The classic paper is [Kinniment and Woods 1976], which describes how to build a \\"3 state flip flop\\" to solve this problem, and [Ginosar 2003], a caution to engineers on common mistakes in arbiter design. This result is of considerable practical importance, as multiprocessor computers would not work reliably without it. The first multiprocessor computers date from the late 1960s, predating the development of reliable arbiters. Some early multiprocessors with independent clocks for each processor suffered from arbiter race conditions, and thus unreliability. Today, this is no longer a problem. Synchronous arbiters Arbiters are used in synchronous contexts as well in order to allocate access to a shared resource. A wavefront arbiter is an example of a synchronous arbiter that is present in one type of large network switch. References *D.J. Kinniment and J.V. Woods.

His father was leader of the Somali National Alliance (SNA), the organization that fought US forces in Mogadishu, and became the President of Somalia on June 15, 1995, through his death on August 2, 1996, after being shot in a tribal battle. Farrah succeeded his father as leader of the SNA, and two days after his father's death, the SNA declared Farrah as the new President, although he too was not internationally recognized as such. Farrah relinquished his claim as president in December 1997, by signing the Cairo Declaration, a significant step toward peace in Somalia. Farrah is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps, having served during Desert Storm, serving in the US military from 1987–1995.

United States military service In April 1987, Farrah enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve. Following his training, he was assigned to the FDC, Fire Direction Control center, of Battery B of the 1st Battalion, 14th Marine Regiment at the Marine Corps reserve training center in Pico Rivera, California. He served during Operation Desert Storm when B 1/14 was mobilized in support of that war. He served in Somalia as a interpreter during Operation Restore Hope, having been chosen because he was the only United States Marine who spoke Somali. Following his discharge, he remained in the United States and became a naturalized citizen. Somali National Alliance (SNA) When he turned 30 years old, Farrah was selected by the Habar Gidir clan as successor to his father and returned to Somalia.Hussein Farrah Aydiid Dictator for Hire In the second half of the 1990s, different faction leaders vied for the Presidency, with none receiving international recognition. General Mohamed Farrah Aidid claimed to be President from June 15, 1995 to his death on August 1, 1996. Following this Hussein was sworn in as \\"interim President\\", and became leader of the Somali National Alliance (SNA), the same alliance his father led against the US forces. Farrah was seen by the West as a chance of improvement for the relationships between them and Somalia. On September 1, 1996, Aidid met with UN representatives for the first time, to deal with issues left over as legacies of his father's administration. Issues addressed at the meeting which needed to be resolved before the return of UN workers and the resumption of UN assistance included the following concerns:Somalia: Humanitarian Situation Report, September 1996 UN Humanitarian Coordinator and Resident Representative for Somalia On December 17, 1996, rival warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed attacked his headquarters after five days of fighting that left 135 dead in Mogadishu.Timeline Somalia Timelines.ws On December 22, 1997, he relinquished the disputed title of President by signing the Cairo Declaration, in Cairo, Egypt following a peace process between Salbalar administration and Soodare Group. On March 30, 1998, Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Aidid formed a peace plan which shared power over Mogadishu, ending a period of seven years of fighting after the ouster of Siad Barre. On February 23, 1999, militiamen loyal to Aidid murdered 60 civilians in Baidoa and Daynunay.

Patients with scleroderma, a disease that thickens and hardens the skin, sometimes require oral commissurotomy to open the corners of the mouth, the commissures, to allow dental treatment. This procedure often leaves characteristic scars. TOC In cardiac valves Commissurotomy of cardiac valves is called valvulotomy,TheFreeDictionary > valvotomy Citing: WordNet 3.0, Farlex clipart collection. © 2003-2008 Princeton University, Farlex Inc. and consists of making one or more incisions at the edges of the commissure formed between two or three valves, in order to relieve constriction such as occurs in valvular stenosis, especially mitral valve stenosis. In neurosurgery In neurosurgery, as a treatment for severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum, or the area of the brain that connects the two hemispheres, would be completely bisected. By eliminating the connection between the two hemispheres of a patient's brain, electrical communication would be cut off greatly diminishing the amount and severity of the epileptic seizures. For some, seizures would be completely eliminated. Though no effect on behavior was observed after commissurotomy was performed on monkeys, it gave peculiar effects on human perception. Different functions of cognition are predominantly located on one of the hemispheres. For example, Brocas area, crucial for forming sentences, is on most people situated in the left hemisphere ventral to the facial motor cortex. The left hemisphere is referred to as the \\"talking\\" hemisphere and the right the \\"silent\\". A commisurotomy prevents any sensory input to the silent hemisphere from reaching the talking hemisphere. Since the left visual field is processed in the right hemisphere, a person with a commissurotomy is unable to describe objects to the left, because the \\"talking\\" hemisphere has not seen anything. It appears as though the person hadn't seen anything at all, and it doesn't bother him either. It can be demonstrated that stimuli to the right hemisphere for example give emotional response, but because of the severed corpus callosum it cannot be verbalized.Bear, Connors, Neuroscience third edition References Cardiac surgery ","title":"Commissurotomy"},{"id":"2827293","text":"CountyWatch is a direct action group in the United Kingdom that was set up in 2004 to remove what they consider to be wrongly placed county boundary signs – i.e. signs that do not mark the historic or ancient county boundaries of England and Wales. Since 2005, Count Nikolai Tolstoy has been a patron of CountyWatch. CountyWatch and its supporters claim to have removed, re-sited or erected 80 county boundary signs in Dorset, County Durham, Greater Manchester, Hampshire, Lancashire, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire, Somerset and Warwickshire. A prominent member of the group is Anthony Bennett, a British politician. In May 2002 Bennett was prosecuted for removing 29 metric road signs, claiming they were illegal and that he was preventing the law from being broken. He buried the signs in four locations under bushes. Initially found guilty of theft and criminal damage, his theft conviction was overturned in October 2002 on appeal. The judge stated that \\"there was no evidence of dishonesty or that he intended to permanently deprive the owners of their signs.\\" His conviction for criminal damage was upheld, but the judge discharged the sentence, which had been 50 hours of community service. Beliefs CountyWatch sees the abolition of democratically elected county councils in the UK as part of a long-term project to weaken the constituent nations of Europe, notably the UK, and to concentrate power at two levels: Brussels (the European Commission) and the \\"regions\\" within countries. CountyWatch believes in taking direct action within the law to counter aspects of this project.Tony Bennett, \\"The Counties\\" Association of British Counties newsletter, Spring 2006 There have been similar illegal acts before. The former county of Humberside was extremely unpopular with some of its residents. The book The Fight for Yorkshire by Michael Bradford detailed a series of cases where signs were altered to read \\"East Riding of Yorkshire\\" in North Humberside.The Fight for Yorkshire, Michael Bradford, Hutton Press, Beverley, 1988 None of these acts were ever prosecuted and in 1996 the county was abolished. Direct action =Bedfordshire= In August 2007, CountyWatch took its campaign to Bedfordshire, where, in November 2006, Bedfordshire County Council erected four signs on the main roads on the north, west and south sides out of Luton proclaiming 'Welcome to Bedfordshire'. Luton is the largest town within the historic and ceremonial county of Bedfordshire. Some letter writers still address mail to \\"Luton Beds\\". Some organisations based in Luton, such as the University of Bedfordshire, include 'Bedfordshire' as part of their address. In 1996, the Royal Mail stopped using Postal Counties as a method of sorting mail, using instead the post code. However, they have a \\"flexible addressing policy\\" whereby historic counties can be used. Luton became a unitary authority on 1 April 1997. Bedfordshire County Council no longer runs any services in the area covered by Luton Borough Council. The County Council erected the signs only in November 2006 in a struggle to save Bedfordshire County Council from extinction against rival bids from the Borough of Bedford to become a unitary Borough Council and from Mid Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire Councils to become another unitary authority, to be called Central Bedfordshire. The signs were unpopular with some Luton residents, some of whom called the signs \\"snooty\\". Bedfordshire County Council responded by saying, \\"Luton has been a unitary authority since 1997 and is therefore not part of Bedfordshire. In July 2007, the government announced that Bedfordshire County Council would be abolished in 2010. On 9 August 2007, CountyWatch removed four Welcome to Bedfordshire signs from Luton, claiming they were misleading to the public. One sign was removed from the B653 to Wheathampstead and re-erected on the A505 near Stopsley in front of a Welcome to Luton sign. The other three signs were removed from the A6, the A505 and the B579. CountyWatch claimed these were being stored at a secure location and added that the signs would be returned to the County Council if they were re-sited on what CountyWatch deem to be the true Bedfordshire boundaries. The County Council responded by stating that, \\"This is absolutely crazy. We are proud of our county and we like to ensure that visitors are given a warm welcome. The signs on the edge of Luton mark the boundaries of their responsibilities and the beginnings of ours.\\" =Berkshire= In April 2006 the group set up \\"Royal County of Berkshire\\" signs on the ancient border between Berkshire and Oxfordshire. The signs were quickly removed. The Mayor of Abingdon, once the county town of Berkshire, now administered by Oxfordshire County Council, said \\"I still get letters addressed to me with Abingdon, Berkshire, and many older people still have allegiances.\\" The Mayor of Wantage, however, noted, \\"I think Count Tolstoy and his supporters are living in the past. They need to face reality. I know there are many older people in Wantage who still think of themselves as Berkshire people, but the reality is that time has moved on and we can't go backwards.\\" The Mayor of Faringdon said that \\"Faringdon should stay in Oxfordshire\\", noting that \\"when we were in Berkshire, County Hall in Reading was so far away. It's much better for us to get into Oxford.\\" =Dorset and Hampshire border= On 10 November 2005, Tony Bennett removed a Dorset sign from Chewton Bunny at Highcliffe and moved it to its historic location at the original County Gates border between Bournemouth and Poole, claiming that while Bournemouth and neighbouring Christchurch had been administered by Dorset County Council for the past 30 years, they remained historically Hampshire towns. =Durham= In May 2006, CountyWatch announced that it has been contacted by Durham residents who were unhappy that Durham County Council had recently relocated signs from the historic boundary between Durham and Yorkshire and relocated them to the Darlington boundary. It would be travelling around Durham looking to see whether signs were on what it consider to be the correct, true border and would remove County Durham signs from the border with the unitary authority of Darlington to the historic and currently ceremonial border with North Yorkshire on the River Tees on 25 May 2006 and re-erect them on suitable posts along the River Tees. The BBC and Tyne Tees Television filmed CountyWatch removing the boundary signs at Royal Oak. Twelve signs with, \\"County Durham: Land of the Prince Bishops\\" were removed. Three of them were re-erected along the historic border between Yorkshire and Durham - the River Tees, also the current ceremonial border. The Council were informed by CountyWatch of the location of the other signs they removed. Durham County Council issued a statement saying that CountyWatch's actions were \\"nothing more than sheer vandalism, no less mindless or anti-social than smashing bus stops or phone boxes\\". On 31 May 2006, an article in The Northern Echo newspaper praised the group's actions, calling the council's statement \\"a trifle wide of the mark\\" and ended the article - \\"Carry on CountyWatch\\". =Lancashire= In November 2005 CountyWatch removed over thirty 'Welcome to Lancashire' signs from Blackburn, Blackpool, Skelmersdale and Southport, placing all of them on the historic Lancashire/Yorkshire border at Blacko near Nelson, where they telephoned the Council's Solicitor. Lancashire County Council reacted by stating that \\"the cost of replacing the signs would be met from taxpayers' money.\\" and also that it would be speaking to the police about the group. The Welcome to Lancashire signs were erected on the boundaries with Blackburn with Darwen and Blackpool unitary authorities by the county council in 2004 to show where its services begin. CountyWatch responded stating that, \\"The sign says 'Welcome to Lancashire', it doesn't say 'Welcome to the administrative unit of Lancashire County Council - that would be all right.\\" The signs which were dumped by the side of the A682 in Blacko, near to the historic border with Yorkshire, were recovered by Lancashire County Council who stated that they would re-erect them. CountyWatch also claimed to have removed the larger brown-coloured motorway signs on the M6, M66 and M61 which read \\"Welcome to Lancashire the Red Rose County\\". They also claimed that they had a legal right to remove signs under the section 131 of the Highways Act 1980 because \\"they misinform the public\\". =Lincolnshire= On 27 July 2005, the BBC TV Look North regional news programme featured the group and filmed it in the act of removing a \\"Welcome to the County of Lincolnshire\\" sign near Brigg. Lincolnshire County Council Area Highways Manager Eric Jorgensen described the group as \\"self-appointed and unelected\\" and stated that taxpayers would be forced to pay for the signs to be replaced. On 22 September 2005, CountyWatch removed ten road signs stating: \\"Welcome to the County of Lincolnshire\\" between Brigg and Immingham, which the group claimed there was no point in putting up a welcome sign 15 miles into the historic county. CountyWatch claimed, \\"Lincolnshire starts where Yorkshire finishes – not 20 miles into Lincolnshire. We want them erected on the proper boundary\\". Lincolnshire County Council however attacked the group for taking council property and said \\"it will cost the taxpayer to put the signs back up\\". The signs were deposited at a council depot after being removed. =Somerset= In August 2004, CountyWatch's first action was the removal of five signs saying 'Welcome to the County of Somerset', on the northern border of the non-metropolitan county of Somerset with either Bath and North East Somerset or North Somerset. The signs were taken down by CountyWatch members and relocated on the historic borders of Somerset with neighbouring historic counties Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. Nine new local authorities On 25 July 2007, the Local Government Minister, John Healey from the Department for Communities and Local Government announced that nine all-purpose local authorities would be created in 2009 in England. CountyWatch see this as the next phase of attempts to replace the administration of England and Wales by county and district councils with a series of so-called 'unitary' authorities, which combine the administrative functions of both district councils and county councils. Region-wide functions will be carried out by regional development agencies and new government quangos, following the announcement earlier in the month of the abolition of unelected regional assemblies from 2010.

Beech Fork Lake is also partly located in neighboring Cabell County. Millers Fork and Stowers Branch join Beech Fork with their own river valleys contributing to the majority of the lakesurface of Beech Fork Lake. These streams are tributaries of Twelvepole Creek. Beech Fork Lake as a flood control impoundment was authorized by the Flood Control Act of October 23, 1962 and was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the mid-1970s. The lake was completed and dedicated in May 1978.  History of Beech Fork  Known in agrarian times as \\"Bean Capital Of The World\\" because of its abundant harvests, remote Beech Fork and its fertile farms had by the mid-20th century devolved into a \\"Tobacco Road\\" cut off from the opportunities of modern development. Some tombstones in the park's Bowen Cemetery date to the 18th century; and family names adorning Civil War graves can be seen on roadside mailboxes even today. Government appropriation of private land for the lake caused rancor among locals with historic land holdings. The Beech Fork strain of Adkins family (appropriately known as \\"Beech Fork Adkinses\\") was largely driven out to the Huntington metropolitan area. So numerous were these displaced persons that townsfolk joked about an \\"Adkins factory\\" at Beech Fork which mass-produced persons of the surname. It has also been said that in the last days, Willie Adkins \\"the Jews will go back to Palestine and the Adkinses will go back to Beech Fork.\\"  Recreation  Boating, fishing, hiking, camping, and picnicking opportunities are available on site. Biking or walking along the roadways around the park, however inviting, is not generally recommended due to automobile traffic along the narrow rural routes. = Birding = The park is an excellent site for birdwatching. Thousands of square miles of Appalachian hardwood trees surround the Beech Fork Lake area, providing a habitat for wood warblers, vireos, thrushes, chats, cuckoos, ovenbirds, and many other forest dwelling birds. Due to a lack of extensive wetlands attractive to waterfowl, such species are comparatively less common.

Exploring themes of racism and inequality, it follows the story of an orphan boy looking for a home in the fictional town of Two Mills. Two Mills is harshly segregated between the East and West, blacks and whites. He becomes a local legend for feats of athleticism and helpfulness, and his ignorance of sharp racial boundaries in the town. It is popular in middle school curricula, and has been used in social studies on the premises of reaction to racial identity and reading. A TV movie was released on February 23, 2003. Major characters  * Jeffrey Lionel \\"Maniac\\" Magee is an orphan and finds himself in Two Mills, where he becomes a local legend while trying to find a home. He has astonishing athletic abilities, runs everywhere he goes, can untie any knot, is allergic to pizza, and crosses the barrier between the East End and West End as if blind to racial distinction. He has done many heroic feats such as running for a long period of time, hitting many home runs in a row, entering Finsterwald's backyard, and untying Cobbles Knot. He lived in many temporary homes, even once with buffaloes. * Amanda Beale is the first person Jeffrey meets in Two Mills. She carries her books in a suitcase so they aren't ruined by her younger siblings, Hester and Lester. She defends Jeffrey from Mars Bar and eventually provides him with a home. She is very stubborn. When some one destroys her book, encyclopedia A, she gets very mad and sad. * Mars Bar Thompson is the worst kid in the East End. He dislikes Jeffrey's presence in the East End, which is exacerbated when Jeffrey beats him in a race. However, he eventually rescues Russell McNab from the trolley truss, and offers Jeffrey a place for a while. As his nickname implies, he is known for eating Mars Bars. His real first name is never revealed. * John McNab is infuriated when he cannot strike out Jeffrey with his ball. After acting as a bully, he welcomes him into his home when he brings back John's younger brothers, Piper and Russell, after their attempt to run away to Mexico. He remains convinced that the black East Enders are planning a rebellion. * Piper and Russell McNab are John McNab's younger brothers who play hooky, steal, and constantly try to run away from home. In their house, they use toy machine guns to shoot the \\"rebels\\" from the East End. Piper also had a party at the end of the book. They make Mars Bar mad at Maniac. Later they play on the trolley tracks and Mars Bar saves Russell. They are eight years old. * Earl Grayson is the groundskeeper at the zoo and resident of the YMCA, though he was once a minor league baseball pitcher who struck out Willie Mays. He becomes friends with Jeffrey, who listens to his stories and Jeffrey teaches him to read. They end up living together in a house, which makes him responsible. He is very kind and cares about Jeffrey. Tragically, Grayson, as he is called in the book, passes away shortly after Christmas, leaving Jeffrey all alone once again. * Mrs. Beale is the kind and caring mother of Amanda, Hester, and Lester. She is very sweet and thoughtful to Maniac as well. * Hester and Lester are the brother and sister of Amanda Beale, and the son and daughter of Mrs. Beale. They are very hyperactive, and will mess up anything that they can get their hands on by drawing on things. Plot summary Jeffrey Lionel Magee's parents were killed in a trolley accident when a drunk driver crashed and sunk it into the river in Bridgeport, Pennsylvania, orphaning him at age three. After living with his Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan in Hollidaysburg and enduring their mutual hatred and silence for eight years, he runs away during a school musical performance. Over a year and 200 miles later, he finds himself across the river from Bridgeport in Two Mills, where Hector Street divides. He meets Amanda Beale, an East Ender who carries her suitcase full of books to keep them away from her younger siblings and borrows one before continuing his dash through town. Along the way, he intercepts a football pass made to local football star James \\"Hands\\" Down, infuriates gigantic little leaguer John McNab by hitting home runs off his fastball, and saves an unlucky child from Finsterwald's backyard, which is full of negative energy. Because of these acts, he earned the nickname \\"Maniac\\" and started a local legend. When \\"Mars Bar\\" Thompson corners Jeffrey and rips a page from Amanda's book, he is rescued by Amanda. He finds a home with her and her family, helping Mr. and Mrs. Beale with the chores and pacifying Hester and Lester. Soon though, a few East Enders make it clear to him that they don't want him in there anymore by writing racist graffiti on the Beales' front door, \\"Fishbelly go home\\" to be exact. His final effort to gain acceptance is by untying the famous Cobble's Knot. After finishing the task he is praised by everyone as confetti is thrown into the air. Amanda realizes, too late, that it was made from the pages of her favorite book, an Encyclopedia A. Jeffrey runs away, taking shelter at the buffalo pen at the zoo. At the zoo, Jeffrey meets Earl Grayson, a major-league baseball pitcher who is also a groundskeeper, has never learned to read, and insists he has no stories to tell (which is not true). For a few weeks, Jeffrey has a home again with him, helping him at work, celebrating holidays with him, and teaching him to read. Grayson passes away 5 days after Christmas, and Jeffrey runs away. On the verge of death, he encounters Piper and Russell, child ruffians that turn out to be John McNab's brothers. He leads them back home, bribing them with free pizza, and stays at their cockroach-infested, waste-filled house. Here, he finds the worst that the West End has to offer, as he learns that the McNabs are making a bunker because they believe the East End is planning a rebellion. He endures the coarseness and squalor of their home in hopes of keeping Piper and Russell in school and under control, but he is kicked out when he crushes Piper and Russell's toy guns. Even though he lives in a home where there is a lot of belief in racial inequality, he still doesn't understand it. After beating Mars Bar in a foot race and goading him into crashing Piper's birthday party at the McNabs' house, Jeffrey is homeless again. He moves back into the buffalo pen and runs for miles every morning before Two Mills wakes up. Before long, Mars Bar starts running with him as if by coincidence, and they never say a word to each other. One day they come across a hysterical Piper McNab, who frantically leads them to Russell, stuck on the trolley trestle where Jeffrey's parents died. He walks away silently, nearly unconscious and stunned by fear, while Mars Bar rescues Russell, becoming a hero in his eyes. Jeffrey retreats once again to the buffalo pen, where Mars Bar leads Amanda to it. She brings him to her house in a huff, with Jeffrey and Mars Bar following her. Background The imaginary town of Two Mills is based on Jerry Spinelli's childhood town of Norristown, Pennsylvania. Spinelli has said that the material from the story was inspired by his childhood experiences there, and a number of geographical correspondences confirm this. Norristown, like Two Mills, is across the Schuylkill River from Bridgeport, and neighboring towns include Conshohocken, Jeffersonville and Worcester, all of which are mentioned in the novel. The Elmwood Park Zoo is in Norristown, and Valley Forge, where Maniac wanders, is nearby as well. There is also a street named Hector Street in Conshohocken. Reception =Critical reviews= The book was well- received upon publication, variously lauded in reviews as \\"always affecting,\\" having \\"broad appeal,\\" and being full of \\"pathos and compassion.\\" Booklist reviewer Deborah Abbot says, \\"...this unusual novel magically weaves timely issues of homelessness, racial prejudice, and illiteracy into a complicated story rich in characters and details...an energetic piece of writing that bursts with creativity, enthusiasm, and hope.\\" Reviewers noted that the theme of racism was uncommon for \\"middle readers\\". Criticism concentrated on Spinelli's choice of framing it as a legend, which Shoemaker calls a \\"cop- out,\\" which frees him from having to make it real or possible. It has also been called \\"long-winded,\\" and seeming like a \\"chalkboard lesson.\\" =Awards and honors= Awards and honors for the book include: * 1990: Boston Globe/Horn Book Award * 1991: Carolyn Field Award, Newbery Medal (American Library Association) * 1992: Charlotte Award, Dorothy Canfield Fisher Award, Flicker Tale Award, Indian Paintbrush Book Award, Rhode Island Children's Book Award * 1993: Buckeye Children's Book Award, Land of Enchantment Award, Mark Twain Award, Massachusetts Children's Book Award, Nevada Young Readers' Award, Pacific Northwest Library Association Young Reader's Choice Award, Rebecca Caudill Young Reader's Book Award, West Virginia Children's Book Award, William Allen White Award The U.S. National Education Association named Maniac Magee one of \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\\" based on a 2007 online poll. In 2012 it was ranked number 40 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. =Use for educational and research purposes= The book is popular in elementary schools as a historical-fiction novel. Many study units and teaching guides are available. including a study guide by the author. It has been used as a tool in scholarly work on childhood education and development. Fondrie cites it as an example in a discussion of how to bring up and discuss issues of race and class among young students. McGinley and Kamberlis use it in a study of how children use reading and writing as \\"vehicles for personal, social, and political exploration.\\" Along the same lines, Lehr and Thompson examine classroom discussions as a reflection of the teacher's role as cultural mediator and the response of children to moral dilemmas, and Enciso studies expressions of social identity in the responses of children to Maniac Magee. In a less pedagogical vein, Roberts uses the character of Amanda Beale as an archetypal \\"female rescuer\\" in a study of Newbery books, and Sullivan suggests the book as being useful in discussions of reading attitudes and difficulties. Adaptations The book was adapted as an audiobook by Listening Library in 2005 () and as a TV movie in 2003, which was nominated for the Humanitas prize in the children's live action category.

Written in the tradition of C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia, this series present a fantasy world of kings, sorcerers and goblins in an allegorical fashion.  About the books  The books, in order of publication, are: # The Tower of Geburah (1978) # The Iron Sceptre (1981) # The Sword Bearer (1986) # Gaal the Conqueror (1989) # Quest for the King (1995) # The Dark Lord's Demise (2001) The books, in chronological order, are: # The Sword Bearer (1986) # Gaal the Conqueror (1989) # The Tower of Geburah (1978) # The Iron Sceptre (1981) # Quest for the King (1995) # The Dark Lord's Demise (2001) The Archives of Anthropos is written in the style of The Chronicles of Narnia, by C.S. Lewis and use the same type of allegory: children from Earth are magically transported to another world where they are called by a Christ-figure to play key roles in that other world's history. John White, the author, admitted having crafted the series after Lewis' own children's allegory. He writes in the appendix of his fifth book, Quest for the King: > \\"My own children ganged up on me and came with the request that since I > wrote books for adults, I could write them for children too. (Of course > their assumption was incorrect!) \\"We won't bug you any more,\\" they said, \\"if > only you'll write a book for us. But it has to be just like Narnia!\\" So, > intrigued, I decided I'd have a crack at it ... I wrote, and then read them > my opening chapter of what eventually turned into The Tower of Geburah.\\" Responding to the criticism that he was merely copying Lewis' work, he writes \\"People said (quite accurately), 'He's just trying to copy Lewis.' I was. This was what my children wanted. That is, I was trying to copy Lewis at first, but I soon ceased to. Copying gets you nowhere. You have to make any genre your own for it to work.\\"  Reading order  As John White explains in the appendix of Quest for the King, he wrote The Tower of Geburah and The Iron Sceptre first, but felt compelled to write the prequel novels to explain parts of the prior history of Anthropos, such as \\"Where did the tower of Geburah come from?\\" In regards to the published vs. chronological order of the books, he writes: > \\"So if you wish to read them in the least confusing arrangement, follow the > [chronological] sequence\\" External links *InterVarsity Press *Illustrator Christian novels Fantasy novel series Series of children's books British children's novels Christian children's books British fantasy novels Children's fantasy novels Christian allegory ","title":"The Archives of Anthropos"},{"id":"2827321","text":"Grizzly River Run is located at Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. It is similar to Kali River Rapids in Disney's Animal Kingdom but distinctive as the rafts are engineered to spin as they descend chutes. The attraction's name comes from Grizzly Peak, the bear shaped mountain that the rapids flow around. It was designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and constructed by Intamin. In 2015, the \\"Condor Flats\\" area in Disney California Adventure was merged with Grizzly Peak to become the Grizzly Peak Airfield. Ride experience Grizzly Peak is designed as an early 20th- century California state park. =Queue= The queue takes place in the fictional Grizzly River Rafting Company. The extended queue winds past an office that features a radio, a map of the river, a canoe, and a list of the various rapids on the river. Guests past various water buckets as they head to the loading station. As part of the park's major 2007–2012 refurbishment, the old queue that had been themed around extreme sports was replaced with an homage to California state parks, specifically after Redwood Creek and the Sacramento River. Elements that evoke the \\"golden age\\" of national parks are placed around the entrance, alluding to the wave of turn-of-the-century wildlife conservation. =Main ride= The raft trip around Grizzly Peak begins with the raft being lifted up a wooden conveyor that runs under leaking pipes that spray water on the riders. Upon reaching the top of the conveyor, the rafts are dropped into the water to be descended down the peak, passing through a cave and bumping against a log jam. The climax of the ride drops the rafts down into a geyser field. The final drop has a unique element in that the rafts are spun as they begin their descent. As with all flume-type rides, there must be a location to store or drain the water in the upper sections of the flumes when the pumps are shut down. The original plan was to create a large, underground basin beneath Grizzly Peak to hold water. This would have required costly excavation and construction. Upon looking at the final layout of California Adventure, it was noticed that the Pacific Wharf area of the park had a water element meant to simulate a tidal basin. The tidal basin is located across a walkway from Grizzly River Run and became the catch basin for water from the raft ride. The rise and fall of water in the tidal basin serves the dual purpose of providing a location to store water and being a scenic element that simulates a rising and falling tide.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a shortstop from to . One of the most ferocious competitors of his era, he won both admirers and critics at each stop during a career which saw him traded every few seasons, often under acrimonious circumstances. While hitting .300 over a full season five times, the two-time National League All-Star led the National League in double plays four times and in putouts and assists three times each. From 1927 through 1946, Bartell played for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1927–30), Philadelphia Phillies (1931–34), New York Giants (1935–38, 1941), Chicago Cubs (1939) and Detroit Tigers (1940–1941). After two years of military service in World War II, he played briefly in 1946 before retiring. At 5'9\\" and 160 pounds, he batted and threw right-handed. A native of Chicago, who grew up in Alameda, California, Bartell played in three World Series and the 1933 All- Star Game, the first to be played. He had one year in the minors, 1926, with the class A Bridgeport Bears in the Eastern League, where he hit .280 in 148 games. At 19, Bartell was the youngest player in the National League. He appeared in only one game at the end of the season, drawing two walks in four plate appearances. He played flawlessly in the field with five chances and one double play. The Pirates lost to the Yankees in four games and the team had to wait until 1960 to make amends. With an aggressive style of play and fiery attitude which earned him his nickname, Bartell was a competent shortstop with good hands and a strong throwing arm. A skillful hitter, he batted a career- high .320 in 1930. After three seasons over .300 with Pittsburgh, he was traded to the Phillies in 1931, and had collected seasons of 40 doubles and 100 runs three times each by 1934. Bartell helped Philadelphia's perennial cellar-dwellers finish in fourth place in the 1932 season, for the only first- division finish by a Phillies team in a span of 32 seasons (1918–42). In 1933 he was elected to the first All-Star Game, and again in 1937. Traded to the New York Giants before the 1935 season, Bartell helped the team win two NL pennants (1936–37), and hit .381 in the 1936 World Series. Leading off for the Giants in the Brooklyn Dodgers home opener in 1937, he complained when the first pitch was called a strike – and was promptly hit in the chest with a tomato thrown from the stands. He later played with the Chicago Cubs in 1939. In 1940, his first season in the American League, he teamed up with second baseman Charlie Gehringer to give the Tigers an AL pennant. Bartell started 1941 with Detroit but returned to the Giants in the midseason as a player- coach. In an 18-season career, Bartell posted a .284 batting average with 79 home runs and 710 runs batted in in 2,016 games played. He also finished with 1,130 runs, 2,165 hits, 442 doubles, 71 triples, 109 stolen bases and 748 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded an overall .955 fielding percentage playing primarily at shortstop but also at third and second base. In 18 World Series games, he hit .294 (20-for-68) with 10 runs, 6 doubles, 1 home run, 7 RBI and 7 walks. Bartell later managed in the minor leagues and coached for the Tigers (1949–52) and Cincinnati Redlegs (1954–55). He died in Alameda at age 87 after suffering from Alzheimer's Disease.

The attraction was the only major permanent attraction based on Lilo & Stitch to have operated in the United States; all other such major attractions since have been exclusive to non-American Disney Parks resorts. The attraction opened on November 16, 2004 as a replacement for Alien Encounter. The attraction operated on a daily schedule until October 1, 2016, after which it entered seasonal operation. In October 2017, the attraction's first pre-show area began being used as a costumed character greeting area for Stitch called Stitch's Alien Encounter Character Greeting!.

On July 16, 2020, Disney confirmed that the attraction was permanently closed, with the attraction's signage later taken down on August 10, 2020. Plot The experience took place in the Galactic Federation Prisoner Teleport Center. Guests were recruited by the Grand Councilwoman (voiced by Zoe Caldwell) to be guards for the United Galactic Federation. After being taught the basic procedures of guard duty and the classification of prisoner hazard levels by Sergeant C4703BK2704-90210 (Richard Kind)—and a brief, but comical, reprisal of Skippy from the ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter—Captain Gantu (Kevin Michael Richardson) gave an alert of a Level 3 prisoner being beamed to the Center. Guests were then instructed by Pleakley (Kevin McDonald) over a public-address system to proceed to the High Security Level 3 prisoner teleportation chamber. After being seated, shoulder restraints came down onto the guests' shoulders (to not confuse the prisoner's DNA with the guests'). The prisoner was then beamed into the chamber via a large plume of smoke and was revealed to be Experiment 626 (Chris Sanders). After a brief period of puzzled talking by Gantu and his two assistants, 626—who called himself \\"Stitch\\", despite not having met Lilo Pelekai yet—used the flaws of the armed laser cannons (the cannons follow and destroy any genetic material, including saliva) and disabled all power to escape, causing mass chaos in the crowd. During this period, hydraulic pumps and small hoses in the shoulder restraints made it seem as if Stitch was jumping on guests' shoulders and tickling their heads. Also, Stitch devoured a chili cheese dog and burped—which was accompanied by a foul smell effect being released into the chamber—and destroyed a cell phone, once again reminding the guests of the rules about eating or drinking in the theater or the use of electronic devices in the theater. When the power came back on, the laser cannons continued their attempt to bring Stitch down. Again using the cannons' fatal flaws, he managed to fire the laser cannons into the crowd. Shortly after using the diversion, he escaped to the Magic Kingdom in Florida (pronounced by the characters as Flor-ee-da). Cameras captured him going into Cinderella Castle where Stitch got into the castle by claiming to be Prince Charming from Cinderella. Stitch crawled in and said, \\"Yoo-hoo, oh Cinderella, your prince is here.\\" Off-camera, Cinderella (Jennifer Hale) realized that Stitch is not her prince, and kicked him out of the chamber. (The original ending of the attraction had Stitch terrorize park guests on Astro Orbiter, with the ending video changing depending on the time of day at the park.) The audience was then released from their duty and exited into one of two gift shops; Merchant of Venus or Mickey's Star Traders (Mickey's name has since been removed from the latter). On the way to the gift shops, guests saw a sign labeled \\"Days without an escape\\" and a big number going down, along with \\"wanted posters\\" featuring some of Stitch's creator Jumba Jookiba's other genetic experiments. (Other experiments also briefly cameoed in the first part of the pre-show.) Technology The attraction included much of the technology and sets from its predecessor, the ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter, including the comical alien Skippy in the second pre-show area. The two 39-inch Audio-Animatronic Stitch figures built by Imagineering were reportedly one of the most complex creations of their size. Other special effects includd binaural sound, simulated laser cannons and a pungent smell of a chili dog.

It was proven independently by Neil Immerman and Róbert Szelepcsényi in 1987, for which they shared the 1995 Gödel Prize. In its general form the theorem states that NSPACE(s(n)) = co-NSPACE(s(n)) for any function s(n) ≥ log n. The result is equivalently stated as NL = co-NL; although this is the special case when s(n) = log n, it implies the general theorem by a standard padding argument.The standard reference for padding in space complexity (which predates this theorem) is . For a stronger padding argument that applies even to sublogarithmic space complexity classes, see . The result solved the second LBA problem. In other words, if a nondeterministic machine can solve a problem, another machine with the same resource bounds can solve its complement problem (with the yes and no answers reversed) in the same asymptotic amount of space. No similar result is known for the time complexity classes, and indeed it is conjectured that NP is not equal to co-NP. The principle used to prove the theorem has become known as inductive counting. It has also been used to prove other theorems in computational complexity, including the closure of LOGCFL under complementation and the existence of error-free randomized logspace algorithms for USTCON.. Proof sketch The theorem can be proven by showing how to translate any nondeterministic Turing machine M into another nondeterministic Turing machine that solves the complementary decision problem under O of the same space constraints, plus a constant number of pointers and counters, which needs only a logarithmic amount of space. The idea is to simulate all the configurations of M, and to check if any configuration is accepting. This can be done in NSPACE of the same magnitude, but needs also a constant number of pointers and counters to keep track of the configurations. If no configuration is accepting, the simulating Turing machine accepts the input; thus it accepts if and only if M has no accepting path. This idea is elaborated in what follows for logarithmic NSPACE (NL); generalization to larger NSPACE is straightforward, but can also be proven by padding. The states of M (described by the position of its head on the input tape and the configuration of the log-space working memory) can be thought of as the vertices of a directed graph, and the transitions of M can be thought of as edges in this graph. M accepts an input string whenever there exists a path in this graph from the vertex that represents the starting state to a special vertex that represents any accepting state. In this way, the existence of an accepting nondeterministic computation for M can be seen as a version of the -connectivity problem, for implicit graphs rather than graphs given explicitly as an explicitly-represented input graph. In this graphical view, the goal of the proof is to find a nondeterministic logspace algorithm that accepts only when there does not exist a path from to in the same implicit graph. An algorithm that solves this non-reachability problem can be based on the principle of counting, for each number from 1 to (the order of the implicit graph), the number of vertices reachable from by paths of length at most . If, at any stage of the algorithm, the correct value of is known for some value of , then it is possible to test whether a given vertex is reachable from by paths of length at most , using the following subroutine: #If , return true #Initialize a counter to 0 #For each vertex in the implicit graph, repeat the following steps: #*Nondeterministically search for a path of length at most from to #*If a path to is found, increment and test whether there exists an edge from to #If , halt the algorithm and reject the input. Otherwise, return true if an edge from to was found, and false otherwise. When used within a larger nondeterministic algorithm, the only accepting computations of the algorithm can be ones in which the subroutine finds paths to all the reachable vertices and computes the correct answer, so this subroutine can be used as if it were deterministic. With it in hand, the algorithm for testing non- reachability of t from s can be expressed by the following steps: #Initialize to 0 and to 1 #Repeat the following steps times: #* // =#vertices reachable within steps #*Initialize a counter to 0 #*For each vertex test whether is reachable from within steps, and if so increment #*Increment and set to #Test whether is reachable from within steps, and reject the input if it is. #Otherwise, if equals , accept the input. The algorithm only needs to maintain representations of a constant number of counters and vertices in its memory, so it uses logarithmic space. By applying this algorithm to the implicit graph constructed from a given nondeterministic machine M, one obtains a nondeterministic machine for the complementary language to the one accepted by M.  Logspace hierarchy  As a corollary, in the same article, Immerman proved that, using descriptive complexity's equality between NL and FO(Transitive Closure), the logarithmic hierarchy, i.e. the languages decided by an alternating Turing machine in logarithmic space with a bounded number of alternation, is the same class as NL.

He last played for Skonto FC in the Latvian First League. Rimkus is of Lithuanian descent. Club career Vīts Rimkus started his career in 1993 with Pārdaugava Rīga, scoring twice in 14 league appearances. After a promising start youngster was transferred to DAG Rīga in 1994. He played 15 league games for the team and scored 3 goals that season. He kept changing clubs and the next season was spent with another club from Riga - Amstrig Rīga. The 1995 season turned out to be a loud start of his career as he managed to net 8 times in 26 matches. Several offers to go abroad appeared and the player chose to move to Switzerland, signing a contract with FC Winterthur. Scoring 8 goals in 10 matches that season, he moved to Germany in 1996, signing for 1. FC Nürnberg. Despite the loud boom in Switzerland, Rimkus couldn't prove himself in Nürnberg, so he was given away to another German club - FC Erzgebirge Aue. 10 matches with no goals made him return to Latvia then. In 1998, he was signed by Skonto Riga. After a really successful season the player was given away to FK Valmiera, where he played for 2 years, showing great performance. In 2001 FK Ventspils signed Rimkus for free and had him playing there until 2004. Scoring 70 goals in 100 matches, he attracted attention from many Russian clubs and was signed by FC Rostov in 2005. Staying goalless in 9 games he was soon released and taken back by FK Ventspils. In the next 5 seasons, as a player of FK Ventspils, Rimkus scored 66 league goals in 109 matches. In 2009, he left the club after rumors about betting on his own team results, but nothing was proved in the end, and later it turned out to be a serious conflict with the board of the club. In 2010 Rimkus moved to Lithuania, signing a one-year contract with FK Ekranas. He became the highest scorer of the team that season with 15 goals in 26 matches respectively, just one goal behind the top scorer of the league Povilas Lukšys.http://f1.sportacentrs.com/futbols/citas_ligas/top/02112010-rimkus_rezultativakais_ekranas_lietuvas_c After the season Rimkus moved to Cyprus, signing a half-season contract with the Cypriot Fourth Division club Finikas Ayias Marinas Chrysochous. In July 2011 he returned to Latvia and signed a contract with the Latvian Higher League newcomers FC Jūrmala. Despite joining in mid-season, with 10 goals in 18 games he became the team's highest scorer in the league.

The Requerimiento (Spanish for \\"requirement\\" as in \\"demand\\") was read to Native Americans to inform them of Spain's rights to conquest. Todorov, Tzvetan (1984) \\"The Conquest of America.\\" New York:HarperPerennial The Spaniards thus considered those who resisted as defying God's plan, and so used Catholic theology to justify their conquest. Historical context In 1452, Pope Nicholas V issued the papal bull Dum Diversas, which legitimized the slave trade, at least as a result of war. It granted Afonso V of Portugal the right to reduce war-conquered \\"Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers\\" to hereditary slavery. As such, the Dominican friars who arrived at the Spanish settlement at Santo Domingo in 1510 strongly denounced the enslavement of the local Indigenous residents. Along with other priests, they opposed the native peoples' treatment as unjust and illegal in an audience with the Spanish king and in the subsequent royal commission. In Spain itself in 1492, the Moorish population of Granada had been given the choice by the first Archbishop of Granada, Hernando de Talavera: become Christian, or leave the country. In a letter to his religious brothers, Cardinal Cisneros, Talavera's successor, would celebrate the “peaceful domination” of the Moors of the Albaicin, a neighborhood of Granada, praising converts, lauding killing and extolling plunder. This letter came, however, after centuries of struggle by Christians in Spain to recapture what they saw as their homeland, which had been under Muslim rule for generations. Thus the war in Iberia, between Christians trying to \\"reconquer\\" land they thought of as properly Christian and Muslims defending the land their forefathers claimed by right of conquest, heightened religious tensions and fervor on both sides. Comparing the situation in the Old World and New World: in Spain's wars against the Moors, the clerics claimed that Muslims had knowledge of Christ and rejected Him, so that waging a Crusade against them was legitimate; in contrast, in Spain's wars against the Indigenous peoples of the Americas and Native Americans, wars against those who had never come into contact with Christianity were illegitimate. Responding to this impeding clerical position, the Requerimiento was issued, providing a religious justification for war against and conquest of the local populations of pre- existing residents, on the pretext of their refusing the legitimate authority of the Kings of Spain and Portugal as granted by the Pope. So, the Requerimiento emerged in the context of moral debates within Spanish elites over the colonization of the Americas, and associated actions such as war, slavery, 'Indian reductions', conversions, relocations, and war crimes. Its use was criticised by many clerical missionaries, most prominently Bartolomé de las Casas. To the King and Queen of Spain (Ferdinand II of Aragon, 1452–1516 and Isabella I of Castile, 1451–1504) the conquest of indigenous peoples was justified by natural law, embodied in the medieval doctrine of “just wars”, which had historically been a rationale for war against non- Christians, particularly the Moors, but which would now be applied to Native Americans. Coming shortly after the Reconquest, the realization of a centuries-long dream by Christians in Spain, the discovery, and colonization of the New World was directly affected by religious and political conditions in a now-unified Iberian Peninsula. Legal justification Concerned that Spain ensure control of the natives in the newly conquered Americas, the “Reyes Católicos”, Ferdinand and Isabella, consulted theologians and jurists for religious and legal justification of Spain's conquests. The treatment of the Native Americans was at first rationalized on the grounds that they were cannibals; any means of subjugation were acceptable. However, some of Christopher Columbus’s tactics with Native Americans had resulted in uprisings. In 1500, the king and queen again sought advice; the Native Americans were declared to be \\"free vassals\\". Despite their elevated status, the Native Americans remained subject to conquest in \\"just wars\\". The Laws of Burgos of 1512 marked the first in a series of ordinances (“Ordenanzas sobre el buen tratamiento de los indios”) with the ostensible goal of protecting the Indians from excessive exploitation; natives could celebrate holidays, be paid for their labor and receive \\"good treatment\\". Similar legislation was adopted by the Junta of Valladolid in 1513 and the Junta of Madrid in 1516. Role of religion The colonization of the New World by European adventurers was \\"justified\\" at the time on spiritual and religious grounds. In the conquest of the Americas, the Christian duty to evangelize nonbelievers took the form of conversion of Indians and other pagans at the hands of Roman Catholic priests. To the European mind, the lands of the New World belonged to no one and could, therefore, be seized. The radical differences in thought and behavior of the Aztec and Mayan states, with their worship of entirely new, fierce gods, human sacrifice by the thousands and complete unfamiliarity with European styles of diplomacy created a sense that conquest was not a war between states but the conquering, by a civilized, society against a ferocious, barbarous enemy. Moreover, since the native population was non-Christian, the Europeans' Christian religion conferred upon them the right and indeed the obligation to take possession of the lands and the people in the name of God and the throne. More particularly, Catholic theology held that spiritual salvation took precedence over temporal and civil concerns. The conversion of pagan natives to Christianity was the rationale for and legitimized Spain's conquests. Thus \\"informed\\" by the Spanish, the Native people of the land had to accept the supremacy of the Catholic Church and the Spanish Crown. The state was authorized to enforce submission, by war if necessary. Content The 1513 Requerimiento, in relation to the Spanish invasion of the Americas and the subsequent Spanish colonization of the Americas, demanded the local populations to accept Spanish rule and allow preaching to them by Catholic missionaries on pain of war, slavery or death. The Requerimiento did not demand conversion, but the Indian Reductions through the Encomienda and Mission systems often did.Newcomb, Steven, Pagans in the Promised Land, Fulcrum 2008, p. 32-36, Williams, Robert A, The American Indian in western legal thought, Oxford University Press US 1992, p. 91-93, This claim provided a legal loophole for enslavement of the population as rebellious vassals if they resisted, and the document stated: \\"We emphasise that any deaths that result from this [rejection of Christian rule] are your fault….\\" The European view of the inherent right to conquest and domination in the New World was captured in a declaration addressed to Indian populations known as El Requerimiento (The Requirement). The document was prepared by the Spanish jurist Juan López de Palacios Rubios, a staunch advocate of the divine right of monarchs and territorial conquest. It was first used in 1513 by Pedrarias Dávila, a Spanish explorer who had fought the Moors in Granada and later became Governor of Nicaragua. The Spanish Requirement, issued in the names of King Ferdinand and Queen Juana, his daughter, was a mixture of religious and legal justifications for the confiscation of New World territories and the subjugation of their inhabitants. At the time, it was believed that Native Americans resisted conquest and conversion for one of two reasons: malice or ignorance. The Requirement was putatively meant to eliminate ignorance. A member of the conquistador's force would read El Requerimiento in Castilian before a group of Indians on the shore, who, with or without translation, remained uncomprehending. All the region's inhabitants were thus considered to have been advised of Spain's religious and legal rights to conquest and forewarned of the consequences of resisting. The true nature of the Spanish Requirement, however, was one of absolution; the symbolic act of reading the document relieved the crown and its agents from legal and moral responsibility for the conquest, enslavement and killing of Native Americans. Readings were often dispensed with prior to planned attacks. As the Spanish Requirement matter-of-factly sets forth, so brazenly from five centuries' retrospect, God created heaven and earth, and the first man and woman from whom all are descended. God directed St Peter to establish the Roman Catholic Church. St Peter's descendant, the Pope, lives in Rome. The Pope has given the New World territories to the King of Castile and directed the conversion of the Indians. If they listen carefully, the Indians will understand and accept what is happening as just; if not, Spain will make war on them. Here what the document does is to create an ontology into which these new lands and their peoples fit; it is creating a place for them in the existing Spanish and European political structure and Christian belief structure. Evaluation Many critics of the conquistadors' policies were appalled by the flippant nature of the Requerimiento, and Bartolomé de las Casas said in response to it that he did not know whether to laugh or to cry. While the conquistadors were encouraged to use an interpreter to read the Requerimiento, it was not absolutely necessary, and in many cases, it was read out to an uncomprehending populace. In some instances, it was read to barren beaches and empty villages long after the indigenous people and communities had left, to prisoners after they were captured, and even from the decks of ships once they had just spotted the coast. Nevertheless, for the conquistadors, it provided a religious justification and rationalization for attacking and conquering the native population. Because of its potential to support the enrichment of the Spanish royal coffers, the Requerimiento was not generally questioned until the Spanish crown had abolished its use in 1556.Williams, p. 93 Text See also *Black legend (Spain) * La Toma * Indian Reductions * Spanish colonization of the Americas * Valladolid debate  Notes   References   * External links * Full Requerimiento text in Spanish - Todos en Español * Galeano, Eduardo: Genesis Calderón, Annie Badilla, Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, “La información y los textos jurídicos de la colonia (II).

Roads 250px Alaska is arguably the least-connected state in terms of road transportation. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the Alaska Highway, the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system. One unique feature of the road system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, which links the Seward Highway south of Anchorage with the relatively isolated community of Whittier. The tunnel held the title of the longest road tunnel in North America (at nearly 2.5 miles [4 km]) until completion of the 3.5 mile (5.6 km) Interstate 93 tunnel as part of the \\"Big Dig\\" project in Boston, Massachusetts. The tunnel retains the title of the longest combination road and rail tunnel in North America. =State highways= { border=\\"0\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  *Alaska Highway *Dalton Highway *Elliott Highway *Glenn Highway  valign=\\"top\\"  *Haines Highway *Klondike Highway *Parks Highway *Richardson Highway *Seward Highway  valign=\\"top\\"  *Steese Highway *Sterling Highway *Taylor Highway *Tok Cut-Off } =Other roads= *Top of the World Highway =Bridges and tunnels= * Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel * Million Dollar Bridge * Knik Arm Crossing (proposed) * Gravina Island Bridge (proposed) * Bering Strait bridge (proposed) Rail and bus travel Alaska Railroad \\"Glacier Discovery\\" train Aside from local industrial operations, only two railroads still operate in Alaska, and both are disconnected from each other and the rest of the North American rail network. The Alaska Railroad runs from Seward through Anchorage, Denali, and Fairbanks to North Pole, with spurs to Whittier and Palmer (locally known as \\"The Railbelt\\"). It carries both freight and passengers throughout its system, but only runs daily passenger service in the summer to accommodate tourists and a more limited weekly passenger service in the winter primarily for residents. The railroad plays a vital part in moving Alaska's natural resources, such as coal and gravel, to ports in Anchorage, Whittier and Seward. The Alaska Railroad is one of the few remaining railroads in North America to use cabooses in regular service and offers one of the last flag stop routes in the country. A stretch of about of track along an area inaccessible by road serves as the only transportation to cabins in the area. Although rail ferry service links Alaska with Washington state (Seattle) and British Columbia, there are plans to link Alaska to the rest of the North American rail network via Yukon Territory and British Columbia.AlaskaCanadaRail.org The White Pass and Yukon Route was established in 1898. Nearly all larger cities and boroughs across the state operate local bus systems, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Sitka, Ketchikan and Bethel. While Greyhound does not operate in Alaska, there are numerous private bus companies in the state that offer regional bus service, with Anchorage and Fairbanks as the primary hub cities.http://alaska.org/gettingaround/advice- alaska-bus-comparison.htm Marine transport Many cities and villages in the state are accessible only by sea or air. Alaska has a well-developed ferry system, known as the Alaska Marine Highway, which serves the cities of Southeast, South central and the Alaska Peninsula. The system also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert, British Columbia in Canada up the Inside Passage to Skagway. In the Prince of Wales Island region of Southeast, the Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities, and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway. Cruise ships are an increasingly popular way for tourists to see Alaska. *Alaska Marine Highway System *Inside Passage *Port of Anchorage *Valdez oil terminal Air transport Cities not served by road or sea can only be reached by air, accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed bush air services--an Alaskan novelty. Anchorage itself, and to a lesser extent Fairbanks, are serviced by many major airlines. Air travel is the cheapest and most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2000-2001, the latest year for which data are available, 2.4 million total arrivals to Alaska were counted, 1.7 million via air travel; 1.4 million were visitorsState of Alaska Office of Economic Development. Alaska Visitor Arrivals and Profile-Summer 2001. November 2002; retrieved September 11, 2006.State of Alaska Office of Economic Development. Alaska Visitor Arrivals and Profile-Fall/Winter 2001. November 2002; retrieved September 11, 2006.). However, regular flights to most villages and towns within the state are commercially challenging to provide. Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger Boeing 737-400's) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak, and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities. The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines like: Ravn Alaska, PenAir, and Frontier Flying Service. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities. But perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and an abundance of items from stores and warehouse clubs. Alaska has the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state: out of the estimated 663,661 residents, 8,550 are pilots, or about one in every 78.Federal Aviation Administration. 2005 U.S. Civil Airman Statistics =Major airports= *Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport *Fairbanks International Airport *Juneau International Airport *Ketchikan International Airport =Airlines= { border=\\"0\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  *Alaska Airlines *Era Aviation *Frontier Flying Service  valign=\\"top\\"  *Pacific Alaska Airways *PenAir } =Other topics= *Bush flying Other transport Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled. In modern times, dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a 1,150-mile (1850 km) trail from Anchorage to Nome. The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash prizes and prestige. In areas not served by road or rail, primary summer transportation is by all- terrain vehicle and primary winter transportation is by snowmobile, or \\"snow machine,\\" as it is commonly referred to in Alaska. Alaska has the highest percentage of people walking as their method of commute to work.U.S. Census Bureau Retrieved January 6, 2012 References External links *FAA Fly Alaska Safely ","title":"Transportation in Alaska"},{"id":"2827432","text":"Windsor is a hamlet in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.

In some legal jurisdictions, and for certain behaviors, it may prevent the accuser from prevailing. It is most frequently presented during divorce proceedings, though it is also used in other legal contexts. Condonation is irrelevant to some acts. For example, some jurisdictions prohibit consensual combat (other than in specially-sanctioned sports, such as boxing). In such a jurisdiction, the people arrested for brawling cannot avoid prosecution by condoning one another's assaults. Common law In the civil law of the common law legal systems, if a creditor states that they forgive a certain debt, they might be blocked (or estopped) from attempting to collect that same debt at a later date. Condonation would not prevent the creditor from collecting any subsequent or other debts, however. =Divorce law= Prior to the advent of no-fault divorce statutes, condonation was frequently asserted as a defense to divorce. Although one spouse may have committed an act that justified the other in obtaining a divorce, the other spouse might be deemed to have forgiven the conduct and thus waived the right to sue for divorce. The most typical way in which condonation occurred is if the wronged spouse, with knowledge of the act, voluntarily engaged in sexual relations with the wrongdoer. Critics of the doctrine contended that it discouraged spouses from attempting reconciliation, as one act of sexual intercourse would deprive the wronged spouse of any relief if the spouses were unable to resolve their differences.

Schindler. The Schindler House was such a departure from existing residential architecture because of what it did not have; there is no conventional living room, dining room or bedrooms in the house. The residence was meant to be a cooperative live/work space for two young families. The concrete walls and sliding glass panels made novel use of industrial materials, while the open floor plan integrated the external environment into the residence, setting a precedent for California architecture in particular. Site After completing the Hollyhock House, Schindler and his wife Pauline vacationedCharlie Hailey - 2008 - Campsite: Architectures of Duration and Place in Yosemite in October 1921. Inspired by the trip, Schindler returned to create a design for multiple families to share a modern living area, much like Curry Village, Yosemite National Park. Architecture The Schindler House is laid out as two interlinking \\"L\\" shaped apartments (referred to as the Schindler and Chace apartments) using the basic design of the camp site that he had seen a year before. Each apartment was designed for a separate family, consisting of 2 studios, connected by a utility room. The utility room was meant to serve the functions of a kitchen, laundry, sewing room, and storage. The four studios were originally designated for the four members of the household (Rudolph & Pauline Schindler and Clyde & Marian Chace). Each person was assigned a studio marked in the plans with his or her initials, and everyone converged in the communal kitchen for domestic chores.Irene Lacher (August 18, 1994), Rescuing a Design Icon: An Austrian museum provides funds to restore the Schindler House Los Angeles Times. The house also has a guest studio with its own kitchen and bathroom. The house, at just under , sits on a lot. Instead of bedrooms, there are two rooftop sleeping baskets. The baskets were redwood four post canopies with beams at mitered corners, protected from the rain by canvas sides. Construction When Schindler first submitted plans to the local planning authorities, they were denied, citing this radical, at the time, new method of construction. After many trips to the local planning office and extensive talks to convince them of its merit, the Building department granted him a temporary permit, meaning that they reserved the right to halt construction at any stage. The house is built on a flat concrete slab, which is both the foundation and the final floor. The walls are concrete tilt up slabs, poured into forms on top of the foundation. The tilt up slabs are separated by , filled with concrete, clear glass or frosted glass. The tilt up panels act as the hard sheltering wall at the back of the house, and a softer permeable screen at the front. Schindler had long been fascinated by the construction method of tilt up concrete slabs, having done extensive research on them in his early days working for Ottenheimer, Stern, and Reichert. He was now intent on using this method for the new home he was designing, along with his friend Clyde Chace. With Schindler as architect and Chace as builder to save costs, construction began in November 1921. Construction was complete by May 1922, with a total cost of $12,550. The landscaping, furniture and sleeping baskets remained to be completed. The Chaces and Schindlers shared the house from the summer of 1922 until July 1924 when the Chaces moved to Florida. History Schindler's friend, partner and rival, Richard Neutra along with his wife Dione and son Frank lived in the Chace apartment from March 1925 until the summer of 1930. Pauline Gibling Schindler left the house and her husband in August 1927 while Rudolph remained at the house until his death in 1953. The Chace apartment had a variety of famous and creative people live in it, including; art dealer & collector Galka Scheyer,Scheyer was the American representative of the Blue Four (painters Wassily Kandinsky, Alexei Jawlensky, Paul Klee & Lyonel Feininger). dancer John Bovingdon, novelist Theodore Dreiser, photographer Edward Weston and composer John Cage. Pauline Schindler returned to live in the Chace Studios part of the house, separate from her former husband, in the late 1930s and stayed until her death in May 1977. Pauline Schindler died in May 1977, leaving the house in the Schindler family until the Friends of the Schindler House (FOSH), mostly friends of the Schindler family, purchased the property in June 1980 from the California State Office of Historic PreservationSuzanne Muchnic (February 18, 1996), Preserving Schindler's L.A. Legacy: The historic buildings of modernist architect Rudolf M. Schindler are getting a sprucing up --thanks to his native Austria Los Angeles Times. with the aid of a $160,000 state grant.Leon Whiteson (October 1, 1989), Schindler Ode to Modernism on the Mend Los Angeles Times. The house was restored by FOSH in the mid-1980s. By this time, the West Hollywood neighborhood had been rezoned to allow four- story apartment buildings. Some FOSH members, including Gregory Ain (who greatly admired Schindler), advocated that the property should be sold and the house rebuilt in the desert, because its context had changed so profoundly. Some aspects of the restoration were criticized, as they erased changes Schindler had made to the structure over time. Over the years, the Schindler House received $200,000 for restoration from West Hollywood and the State of California, and $50,000 for operations from the College of Environmental Design at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. MAK Center for Art and Architecture In August 1994, the Friends of the Schindler House signed an agreement with the Museum für angewandte Kunst Wien or \\"MAK\\" (the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts / Contemporary Art, Vienna) to create the nonprofit MAK Center for Art and Architecture at the Schindler House. The agreement allowed FOSH to retain full ownership of the property, with MAK being responsible for financial obligations and programming. The programming at the MAK Center at the Schindler House investigates the relationship between art and architecture, and includes exhibitions, lectures, symposia and concerts. A $250,000 grant MAK was used to restore the house as a study center for experimental architecture, and the museum also provided an undisclosed amount for operating costs. To guarantee that the house survives financially, the MAK has sought early on to turn it into a public attraction, a rental venue for various functions and a conference center for design students and professionals.Bob Pool (January 20, 2000), Compromise Reached on Schindler House Los Angeles Times. The MAK Center also sponsors six month residencies for art and architecture students annually. The residents live in Schindler's Mackey Apartments in Los Angeles, owned by the MAK Center. The third Schindler residence to come under the stewardship of the MAK Center, the 2,400-square- foot Fitzpatrick-Leland House was donated to the center by Russ Leland in 2008.Diane Haithman (June 4, 2008), Rudolf Schindler-designed home donated to MAK Center for Art and Architecture Los Angeles Times. The Schindler House is open to the public for unguided visits from Wednesday to Sunday, 11 AM – 6 PM, and for tours on weekends. Group tours are available during the week by appointment only. Other In recent years, the Schindler House has had to contend with the rising density of the surrounding neighborhood. The surrounding neighborhood is currently dominated by 4-story condominium and apartment buildings designed by Lorcan O'Herlihy, vastly different from the original expansive lots for single family residences. The condominium was built despite efforts by numerous notable architects who were invited by the MAK Center in 2003 to submit alternative proposals for the site. Selected by a jury that included Frank Gehry, Chris Burden, Michael Asher and Richard Koshalek, all of the resulting proposals—including the three winning designs, by Odile Decq, Eric Owen Moss and Carl Pruscha—were organized into an exhibition, \\"A Tribute to Preserving Schindler's Paradise,\\" at the house.

The band had previously garnered attention for covering well-known rock songs in an \\"acoustic power trio\\" style, but Suspicious Activity? includes only one cover version: the theme to the 1981 movie Chariots of Fire. Instead, the album focuses on the band's original music, including the track \\"O.G. (Original Gentleman),\\" which is a tribute to the legendary jazz drummer Elvin Jones. This would be The Bad Plus' final album for Columbia Records, as the band and the label parted ways in 2006. Outtakes Several cover versions from the Suspicious Activity? recording sessions are available on iTunes and other major online services, including Led Zeppelin's \\"Immigrant Song,\\" Queen's \\"We Are the Champions,\\" and Björk's \\"Human Behaviour.\\" Extended copy protection In November 2005, it was revealed that Sony was distributing albums with Extended Copy Protection, a controversial feature that automatically installed rootkit software on any Microsoft Windows machine upon insertion of the disc. In addition to preventing the CDs contents from being copied, it was also revealed that the software reported the users' listening habits back to Sony and also exposed the computer to malicious attacks that exploited insecure features of the rootkit software. Though Sony refused to release a list of the affected CDs, the Electronic Frontier Foundation identified Suspicious Activity? as one of the discs with the invasive software. Reception Brent Burton of JazzTimes stated, \\"...much of the solid new album is about modern-day contrast. King and bassist Reid Anderson were obviously raised on rock and hip-hop (what 30-something musician wasn’t?) and they show it off with the muscular thwap and throb of their accompaniment... Perhaps Iverson and Co. need not have slaughtered a sacred cow to remind us that it’s 2005, not 1955. But, hey, would they be where they are today if they never tried?\\" Brian P. Lonergan of All About Jazz wrote, \\"The trio's third major-label album, Suspicious Activity?, will do little to quell the arguments the previous two have fueled in the jazz community. And though the approach here is not a radical departure from that on These Are the Vistas or Give, the music does advance the trio's adventurous conceptions of form and rhythmic variation.\\" John L.

Located in Malibu Creek State Park, it sits just northeast of Malibu Canyon Road, and is partially visible from the turnouts south of the tunnel. History The dam was built by hired workers of May Knight Rindge, who owned the Malibu Ranch, the former Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit, at that time. The frame of the dam was constructed out of rails from the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway, which was a 15-mile railroad that May Rindge built through the Malibu Ranch. The dual walls of the dam were built into an already-existing rock monolith in the center of Malibu Creek; the only place they meet is at the top. The main concrete arch of the Rindge Dam was completed in 1924. The spillway of the dam was finished in 1926. The behind the dam have been completely filled with sediment since around 1950, which creates a waterfall from Malibu Creek. The dam became incorporated into Malibu Creek State Park in 1976.Malibucomplete.com: Rindge Dam history Proposed removal Fish advocates have called for the dam's removal because it is blocking Steelhead trout from accessing the upper reaches of the Malibu Creek watershed. Others have campaigned in vain for the designation of the Rindge Dam as a California Historical Landmark. The Rindge Dam is property of the California Department of Parks and Recreation and the structure has been in disrepair for decades. The dam was declared off-limits to the public in 2014. The US House of Representatives authorized a dam removal study in 1992. The US Army Corps of Engineers released a draft in January 2017, entitled the \\"Malibu Creek Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Study\\".\\"Rindge Dam Removal Pathway Risk-Benefit Assessment Request for Proposal\\". California Trout. February 19, 2019. Accessed July 7 2019. Estimates for the cost of demolition have been as high as $80 million. On March 9 2018, the California Coastal Commission endorsed a plan to remove Rindge Dam. The Plan, developed by the Army Corps of Engineers, proposes removing the dam arch and spillway, along with 780,000 cubic yards of sediment impounded behind the dam. Approximately 278,000 cubic yards of clean sandy sediments would be removed by truck to Ventura Harbor, tested for pollution, and then deposited by barge in shallow ocean waters near the mouth of Malibu Creek, east of Malibu Pier. The sediment will be placed to avoid damage to nearshore kelp beds, and to allow the sand to eventually move shoreward and downshore to replenish nearby beaches. The remaining sediment would be deposited in the Calabasas Landfill. The project would also modify or remove barriers, mostly culverts under roads, that block fish migration on the Cold Creek and Las Virgenes Creek tributaries of Malibu Creek upstream from the dam. The project would start in 2025, and take eight years to complete.\\"Staff Report\\". California Coastal Commission. January 25, 2018. \\"Coastal Commission OKs Rindge Dam Removal Plan; Long Way Still to Go.\\" The Malibu Times, March 14 2018. Accessed July 7 2019 Risks associated with the dam removal project include risk of slope instability where the dam and sediments are removed, and an increased risk of flooding downstream from the dam. Downstream neighbors and the City of Malibu have expressed concern about these risks. In 2019 California Trout listed Rindge Dam as one of its top five priorities for dam removal, along with Scott Dam on the Eel River in Potter Valley, Matilija Dam near Ojai, four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, and Searsville Dam above Stanford University.\\"Top Five California Dams Out.\\" California Trout. Accessed July 7 2019. The 1947 Matilija Dam, in the Los Padres National Forest north of Ojai also blocks steelhead trout spawning grounds and is planned for removal.

After Barack Obama won the presidential election, Matt Elrod, the director of the drug policy reform group DrugSense, filed an internet petition for Ethan Nadelmann as the new Drug Czar. Although any hopes in getting Nadelmann appointed were downplayed, \\"this petition will at least encourage President-elect Obama to think twice about his choice of drug czar.\\"Matt Eldord: Drug Czar of my dreams, The Huffington Post, December 18, 2008 Drug Policy Alliance never lobbied for Nadelmann, however once media reports alleged that James Ramstad (R-MN) would be appointed to the post the organization urged people to oppose the appointment due to his opposition to medical marijuana and needle exchange among other things. Seattle's police chief Gil Kerlikowske became the next head of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP),Seattle police chief to become nation's drug czar an appointment that DPA is cautiously optimistic about. On September 28, 2012, Nadelmann spoke at the Human Rights Foundation’s San Francisco Freedom Forum. He discussed the United States' incarceration rates, which are at 743 people per 100,000 inhabitants, and how America's drug policies are affecting that number. =Drug Policy Alliance= Nadelmann founded the Lindesmith Center in 1994, a drug policy institute created with the philanthropic support of George Soros. Six years later the Center merged with the Drug Policy Foundation founded by Arnold Trebach. The merger became the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group for drug policies \\"grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights.\\"Nadelmann's biography at the Drug Policy Alliance. As the Executive Director of the Drug Policy Alliance, Nadelmann takes a public health - rather than a criminal justice - approach to the War on Drugs advocating for the application of harm reduction principles. On December 20, 2012, the Alliance paid for a full-page advertisement in The New York Times to celebrate the legalization of marijuana in Washington and Colorado, signaling \\"the beginning of the end for the costly and unjust war on drugs.\\" The advertisement thanks numerous politicians, including former president Bill Clinton and congressman Ron Paul, for their efforts to combat the war on drugs. Criticisms of drug policies =Latin America= Nadelmann has referred to the United States' drug policies in Latin America as brutal and prohibitionist. He is an advocate for legalization in Latin America. =United States= Nadelmann has been a strong advocate of less restrictive cannabis laws in the United States including legalizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes, regulating recreational usage, and imposing civil rather than criminal penalties for those who are caught using or possessing small amounts of cannabis. Overall, Nadelmann is optimistic about the future of drug policies under President Obama, particularly after his December 2012 interview with Barbara Walters. During the interview, Obama expressed that he did not \\"at this point\\" support widespread legalization of marijuana, which Nadelmann likens to his previously evolving viewpoint on gay marriage, before publicly announcing his support. In 2013, Nadelmann joined Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group; George Papandreou, former prime minister of Greece; David Marlon, Las Vegas-based addiction recovery advocate, to discuss the War on Drugs within the U.S. borders, and cannabis' involvement in policy, incarceration, and addiction prevention. The panel was specifically debating U.S. drug policy at the Starbridge Capital Alternatives Conference, a high-level investment event that brings in top names in business, government, and politics to discuss issues leading to wise investment decisions, which took place in Las Vegas, Nevada.

His father, Hans, expresses scepticism and scorn for excessive religion. Luther displays anguished guilt at what he believes to be his own imperfections and sins.Osborne, pp. 13–23 ;Scene 2 – The same. A year later Luther is preparing to conduct his first Mass as a priest. Another monk, Brother Weinand, tries to persuade him not to exaggerate his own wickedness, and gently dismisses Luther's anxiety as \\"a few imaginary sins\\". Luther, is tormented mentally by guilt and physically by constipation.Osborne, pp. 24–30 ;Scene 3 – Two hours later In the refectory of the monastery after the celebration of Mass, Luther's father is a guest. He has most reluctantly accepted his son's monastic vocation but has nevertheless made a generous donation to the monastery's funds. He drinks too much at luncheon and his comments make clear his disappointment that his intellectually brilliant son has confined himself to a religious order.Osborne, pp. 31–45 ;Act 2 Johann Tetzel ;Scene 1 – The Market Place, Jüterbog. 1517 Johann Tetzel, described by Osborne as \\"an ecclesiastical huckster\\",Osborne, p. 47 addresses a crowd of local people, persuading them to part with their money in exchange for papal indulgences (originally a remission of penance in exchange for a pious donation, but by 1517 represented by such as Tetzel as complete absolution for all sins) .Osborne, pp. 47–51 ;Scene 2 – The Eremite Cloister, Wittenberg. 1517 The Vicar General of the Augustinian Order, Johann von Staupitz, has sent for Luther. Staupitz respects and admires the young monk, and has much sympathy for Luther's scorn of relics and outrage at indulgences. He counsels Luther to be moderate in his public criticisms.Osborne, pp. 52–60 ;Scene 3 – The steps of the Castle Church, Wittenberg. Eve of All Saints. 1517 Luther preaches a sermon scorning scholarly sophistication and insisting that faith alone is the key to salvation. He then nails to the church door his 95 theses against indulgences, issued as a challenge to Tetzel or anyone else to engage him in theological debate.Osborne, pp. 61–63 Luther (r.) before Cajetan ;Scene 4 – The Fugger Palace, Augsburg. October 1518 Cardinal Cajetan, the Papal Legate to Germany, has sent for Luther. The latter's views are by now seen by the Church as verging on heresy, and Cajetan tries, in vain, to persuade Luther to retract. Cajetan warns that Luther's views, if pursued, will cause the break- up of Christendom.Osborne, pp. 64–74 ;Scene 5 – A hunting lodge, Magliana, Italy. 1519 Pope Leo X dictates a decree ordaining that unless Luther recants his views, he will be a heretic and will be excommunicated.Osborne, pp. 75–78 ;Scene 6 – The Elster Gate, Wittenberg. 1520 Luther has by now broken completely from the Roman Catholic Church. He preaches a sermon denouncing the Pope. He burns the papal decree of excommunication and prays for God's support.Osborne, pp. 79–80 ;Act 3 ;Scene 1 – The Diet of Worms. 1521 Luther engages in theological debate with Johann von Eck, who represents orthodoxy against Luther's revolutionary preachings. Luther demands that his opponents should refute his arguments by showing that the Bible contradicts them. He rejects the authority of the Pope and of church councils.Osborne, pp. 81–85 ;Scene 2 – Wittenberg. 1525 A knight, who has until this point merely announced to the audience the time and place of each scene, now has a long speech commenting on the civil disorder that has erupted in the wake of Luther's religious revolution. He engages Luther in conversation, and it emerges that Luther is hostile to the peasant uprising. The knight is deeply disillusioned. Luther prepares to marry an ex-nun.Osborne, pp. 86–93 Staupitz ;Scene 3 – The Eremite Cloister, Wittenberg. 1530. Luther and his wife are living in the former monastery. Staupitz, now an old man, visits them, and looks round the building nostalgically. Luther expresses regret at turning Staupitz's world upside down. He is stung when he believes Staupitz disapproves of his siding with the princes against the peasants during the uprisings. Staupitz counsels moderation, as he had done in 1517. He leaves, and Luther muses aloud while cradling his baby son in his arms.Osborne, pp. 94–102 Critical reception The Times thought the play only a partial success, giving a vivid portrait of Luther the man but not illuminating \\"the inner compulsions or the external events that turned him into a historical personage.\\" The paper also criticised the proportions of the play: \\"Time spent on the makings of the monk is rather badly needed when the chronicle comes to the momentous events of his life.\\" The Guardian's critic, W J Weatherby, objected to the play's harping on Luther's constipation at the expense of his spiritual battles: \\"We get precious little hint of Luther's real struggle\\".Weatherby, W J. \\"Crucified by Constipation\\", The Guardian, 27 June 1961, p. 7 Kenneth Tynan in The Observer pointed out, in Osborne's defence, that Luther's obsession with his bowels was not the invention of the playwright, but was documented in Erik H Erikson's psychiatric study, Young Man Luther.Tynan, Kenneth. \\"Rebel Writer on a Rebel Priest\\", The Observer, 9 July 1961, p. 23 Of the play as a whole, Tynan wrote: Tynan also noted that reviewing the Paris production, L'Express had lamented Osborne's failure to rival \\"the dialectic vigour of Sartre, or the poetic vigour of Eliot\\", a judgment that Tynan considered missed \\"the quick, stark, lively, lyrical, button-holing virtuosity of Mr. Osborne's language.\\"Tynan, Kenneth. \\"At the Theatre\\", The Observer, 30 July 1961, p. 20 Writing of the New York production Howard Taubman said in the New York Times that the play had \\"size and distinction\\".

Railmark Holdings acquired the Yreka Western Railroad in 2017. Railmark acquires Yreka Western Railroad The Yreka Railroad Company was incorporated in May 1888, with a capital stock of $100,000, and opened in January 1889, connecting Yreka to the Southern Pacific Company lessor Central Pacific Railroad (ex-California and Oregon Railroad). The decision to build the Yreka Railroad was due in part to the Southern Pacific's decision to bypass Yreka in favor of a shorter, and more level route through the Shasta Valley and the city of Montague. Not to be left without a rail connection, the citizens of Yreka formed their own railroad. The railroad hauled passengers and local freight. In August 1933, the railroad was re- incorporated as the Yreka Western Railroad Company. The railroad was acquired by Willis Kyle in 1953 who eventually formed the Kyle Railways empire. Eventually, the Union Pacific Railroad acquired the SP connection at Montague in 1995. In 1999 Kyle Railways sold the Yreka Western Railroad to the Rocky Mountain Railway and Mining Museum of Denver Colorado, who in turn, sold the company to Railmark Holdings, Inc. in December 2016. Operations The railroad is an active freight railroad offering direct rail services to the customers on its line, as well as rail logistics and rail transloading services to industrial customers in the northern California and southern Oregon area who are not direct served by rail. The Yreka Western performs mechanical services to freight railcars. Under Railmark's ownership and operation the railroad does not provide excursion passenger rail services. In recent years before 2016, the railroad was operated by The Rocky Mountain Railway and Mining Museum of Denver, Colorado and had provided both freight service and passenger train excursions. The freight traffic on the Yreka Western Railroad is primarily wood chips, forest products, propane, and machinery and bulk commodities. The railroad had provided excursion trains pulled by steam and diesel locomotives from the 1950s until 2007. In 1986 the YW started operating a steam passenger train excursion known as the \\"Blue Goose\\" between Yreka and Montague. The railroad offered scenic views of Mount Shasta, the Shasta Valley and the Siskiyou Mountains. The trip took about one hour in either direction, with a 60 layover in Montague for lunch. While passengers explored and ate in Montague, the crew took the train to perform a runaround move so the locomotive would pull the train back to Yreka. The most famous locomotive to run on the line is 2-8-2 Baldwin 90 ton logging mikado #19. #19 is nicknamed \\"Pancho\\" due to its time spent in Mexico in the 1920s and possible squabble with the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. #19 has starred in many movies, the two most famous being \\"Emperor of the North\\" and \\"Stand By Me\\". She was built in 1915 by Baldwin for the Caddo & Choctaw River Lumber Company in Arkansas. She served there until being sent to Mexico in 1920 where she is believed to have been converted to oil. In 1924 she was purchased by the McCloud River Railroad. She served many years there hauling log trains until being sold to the Yreka Western Railroad in 1953. On September 19, 2016, it was announced that #19 would be up for sale in an upcoming auction and on October 6, 2016, was purchased by the Age of Steam Roundhouse, and is currently being restored in her Emperor of the North paint scheme. Other locomotives include an SW8 #21 (Former Southern Pacific #1115). #21 is unique because it has dynamic brakes, not usually found on switching locomotives.

Background During the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Continental forces patterned cavalry units after those of the opposing British forces, especially the well-supplied mounted dragoons of the British Army (British Army). The first cavalry unit formed by the Congress of the United States of America was a squadron of four troops (the Squadron of Light Dragoons) commanded by Major Michael Rudolph on 5 March 1792 (the troops would then be incorporated into the Legion of the United States (1792 to 1796)). In 1796 the dragoons were reduced to two companies, were dismounted units by 1800 and disbanded in 1802. In 1808 the Regiment of Light Dragoons was formed and in 1812 another regiment (2nd Regiment of Light Dragoons) was raised. Units of both regiments of dragoons served during the War of 1812 in engagements at the Battle of the Mississinewa; the Battle of Lundy's Lane; Fort Erie and the Siege of Fort Meigs. The 1st Regiment and 2nd Regiment were consolidated on 30 March 1814 into the single Regiment of Light Dragoons of eight troops, but this unit was dissolved in 1815 (the rationale was that cavalry forces were too expensive to maintain as part of a standing army, so Congress insisted on economy and a minimum standing Army).Stubbs, Mary Lee; Connor, Stanley.

Captain Nathan Boone The \\"United States Regiment of Dragoons\\" was organized by an Act of Congress approved on 2 March 1833 after the disbandment of the \\"Battalion of Mounted Rangers\\" (formed in 1832 due to a lack of mounted units to patrol the frontier and also in response to the Black Hawk War). The first order announcing appointments in the regiment was dated 5 March 1833, and gave the names of the colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, four captains and four lieutenants, stating that the organization of the regiment would be perfected by the selection of officers from the \\"Battalion of Mounted Rangers.\\" In June 1834, the regiment filled its complement of officers, many of whom later became noted Civil War generals: * Colonel: Henry Dodge (transferred from the Battalion of Mounted Rangers) * Lieutenant Colonel: Stephen W. Kearny (transferred from the 3d Infantry Regiment) * Major: Richard B. Mason. * Captains: Clifton Wharton, E. V. Sumner, Eustace Trenor, David Hunter, Lemuel Ford, Nathan Boone, J. B. Browne, Jesse Bean, Matthew Duncan and David Perkins. * First Lieutenants: Philip St. George Cooke (transferred from the 6th Infantry Regiment), S. W. Moore, A. Van Buren, J. F. Izard, L. P. Lupton, Thomas Swords, T. B. Wheelock, J. W. Hamilton (adjutant), B. D. Moore, C. F. M. Noland, and Jefferson Davis (transferred from the 1st Infantry Regiment, and served as the first adjutant, but resigned the staff position on 4 February 1834, and was assigned to Company A). * Second Lieutenants: James Allen, Theophilus H. Holmes, J. H. K. Burgwin, J. S. Van Derveer, J. W. Shaumburg, Enoch Steen, James Clyman, J. L. Watson, and B. A. Terrett. * Brevet Second Lieutenants: William Eustis, G. W. McClure, L. B. Northrop, G. P. Kingsbury, J. M. Bowman, Asbury Ury, A. G. Edwards and T. J. McKean. The regiment was initially organized as: * Headquarters: Jefferson Barracks, Missouri: 4 March 1833 * Troop A: Nashville, Tennessee: 12 August 1833 * Troop B: Sacketts Harbor, New York: 29 July 1833 * Troop C: Louisville, Kentucky: June 1833 * Troop D: Cincinnati, Ohio: 25 July 1833 * Troop E: New York, New York: 29 June 1833 * Troop F: Jefferson Barracks: 5 December 1833 * Troop G: Jefferson Barracks: 16 January 1834 * Troop H: Jefferson Barracks: 2 March 1834 The unit became the \\"First Regiment of Dragoons\\" when the Second Dragoons was raised in 1836. Frontier duty In October 1833, the five companies first organized were sent under Colonel Dodge to winter in the vicinity of Fort Gibson, Arkansas Territory, where they remained until June 1834. Then, the regiment was sent on the First Dragoon Expedition, or the Pawnee Expedition, during which, although it ended in September, a full one-fourth of the officers and men died of fever. For the winter, Headquarters with Companies A, C, D and G, were sent to Fort Leavenworth; Companies B, H and I, Lieutenant Colonel Kearny, commanding, into the Indian country on the right bank of the Mississippi River, near the mouth of the Des Moines River; and Companies E, F and K, Major Mason commanding, to Fort Gibson. Throughout the summer of 1835, all the companies of the regiment were kept in the field. In the right foreground stands a subaltern of the First Regiment of Dragoons; in the left foreground is an ordnance sergeant-of which there was one on every Army post. The regiment became the \\"First Regiment of Dragoons\\" when the Second Regiment of Dragoons was raised in 1836, however, the general disposition of the regiment remained unchanged. The various companies were employed in scouting among the Indians, especially along the Missouri frontier, with a portion of the regiment going to Nacogdoches, Texas, to keep white trespassers from the Indian lands, and preserving peace between whites and Indians and among the Indians themselves; also in building wagon roads and bridges. During the winter, the companies returned to their respective stations – Forts Leavenworth, Gibson and Des Moines. Colonel Dodge resigned on 4 July 1836, and was appointed Governor of Wisconsin. He was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Kearny. The regiment was not heavily engaged in the Florida war, although it did take some minor casualties, including a lieutenant. In March 1837, a regimental order designated the color of the horses of each company as follows: A and K, black; B, F and H, sorrel; C, D, E and I, bay; and G, iron gray. In October 1837, and again in March 1838, Colonel Kearny led elements of the regiment to quell Osage Indians. In April 1839, the army created Fort Wayne in Indian Territory, and Companies E, F, G and K, were stationed there for several years, with occasional forays into the field to chase hostile Indians. Kearny was promoted to brigadier general on 30 June 1846, and was succeeded by Colonel Mason. Mexican–American War 1st Regiment of Dragoons in Mexican–American War General Kearny was placed in command of the \\"Army of the West (1846)\\", which consisted of Companies B, C, G, I and K, 1st Dragoons, an artillery battalion, some separate infantry companies, two regiments of Missouri volunteer cavalry, the volunteer Mormon Battalion, and the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers, which sailed from New York City to California by ship. All in all, the Army of the West consisted of about 3,700 men, which ventured west to New Mexico, some of whom did not reach California. This command was concentrated at Bent's Fort on the Arkansas River, from which point it marched for Santa Fé on 1 August 1846. The force occupied Santa Fé without much opposition, and, after leaving part of his force there, Kearny marched into California, arriving in December. On the morning of 6 December 1846, Kearny's 150-man command met and defeated an equal number of California lancers at San Pasqual, about 40 miles from San Diego, under Major Andrés Pico. The action was severe, with the 1st Dragoons losing 3 officers and 14 men killed, principally with lance thrusts. General Kearny himself received two wounds. His force finally reached San Diego on 12 December 1846. Kearny, with a force consisting of Company C, 1st Dragoons, (60 dismounted men) under Captain Turner, sailors and marines with a battery of artillery and California volunteers, left San Diego for Los Angeles on 29 December. Kearny's troops routed Mexicans under Governor Flores at the crossing of the Rio San Gabriel on 8 January 1847, and on the plains of La Mesa on 9 January. With the capture of Los Angeles on the following day, all Mexican resistance to the American occupation of Southern California ceased. Kearny had left Companies G and I at Albuquerque under Capt. J. H. K. Burgwin. When Col. Sterling Price (then in command at Santa Fé) learned of the seizure and murder of the New Mexico Governor Charles Bent and five others by the Mexicans (20 January), he moved out against them with a force of about 350 dismounted men and easily defeated them, on 24 January, at Canada. Captain Burgwin defeated another Mexican force shortly thereafter and rejoined Price's column for a series of further battles. During 1847, regimental headquarters were still at Leavenworth and Companies A and E were with Zachary Taylor in Mexico. Early in the year, Company B was reorganized at Jefferson Barracks before being sent to Santa Fe in June. On 26 June, while en route, the company was engaged by 300-400 Comanches at Grand Prairie, Arkansas, losing five men killed and six wounded. They were the first unit of the Regiment to seriously tangle with the frontier Indians. Upon reaching Santa Fe, on 6 August with the $350,000 they had been escorting, Company B was retrained as a field artillery battery to support the regiment. Companies D, F and K saw service on Scott's line in Mexico. Company F escorted General Scott from Veracruz to Mexico City and was present at the battles near that city. From 1 November to 20 December, it was engaged on escort duty between the city and Vera Cruz. In 1848, the three companies returned to the United States and were stationed at various points on the northwestern frontier. Companies B, G, and I served with General Sterling Price in February – March 1848 in his campaign down into the State of Chihuahua and participated in the attack on Santa Cruz de Rosales. Further Frontier Duty In September 1848, the First Regiment of Dragoons rode out of Fort Kearny and returned to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas and trained their new recruits. On 11 May 1849, the regiment rode further west, and along with two companies of the 6th Infantry Regiment, guarded the treacherous Oregon Trail in the heart of Pawnee territory. In October, an engagement on the Little Blue River near Linden, Nebraska and another engagement on the Platte River resulted in numerous Pawnee fatalities, and 5 Dragoon casualties. On 15 May 1850, J. W. Davidson and Captain Nathaniel Lyon led a regiment of the 1st U.S. Dragoons in an massacre of 60 Pomo Native Americans at Clear Lake, California, the 1850 \\"Bloody Island Massacre\\";Bloody Island Massacre Brevet Brigadier General Mason, Colonel of the 1st Dragoons, died at Jefferson Barracks, on 25 July 1850, and was succeeded by Col. Thomas T. Fauntleroy, promoted from the Second Dragoons. In 1853, the newly acquired Southwest erupted in violence between the US and local Indian tribes. After a reorganization period, elements of the 1st Regiment of Dragoons set out for New Mexico on 1 July 1854. The year of 1854 was rough for the Dragoons; heavy casualties and a tenacious enemy took their toll. Earlier in the year, on 30 March 1854, Companies F and I were stationed at Cantonment Burgwin in New Mexico, and Lieutenant J. W. Davidson, with Company I and 16 men of Company F, disobeyed his orders and boldly attacked a Jicarilla Apache camp about 16 miles south of Taos at Cieneguilla. The Indian camp was surprised and captured; while securing the camp, the troops were surprised by more Indians, who attacked the Dragoon horse-holders and took Davidson at such disadvantage that the command narrowly escaped annihilation. Fourteen men of Company I and eight of Company F were killed; Lieutenant Davidson and 14 men were wounded. Regimental headquarters was transferred to Fort Union, New Mexico Territory, in July 1854, when the rest of the regiment arrived. Throughout the following year, the companies in New Mexico were almost constantly on the move. Colonel Fauntleroy made three expeditions against the Utes and Apaches, and Companies I and K fought the Apaches. On 17 January 1855, Companies B, G, and part of K were attacked at night by a band of Apaches while camped near the Penasco River. Despite being repulsed, the Indians adopted guerrilla tactics and skirmished the next day. On the 19th, 12 troopers from B Company became separated and were ambushed by the Apache, suffering 3 killed including the Company Commander. Meantime, out West, Companies C and E took part in the Rogue River War in Oregon Territory, in which, at the Battle of Hungry Hill, the troops were compelled to retire with a loss of 26 killed and wounded, after fighting for a day and a half. In the spring of 1855, two new regiments of cavalry, the First and Second Cavalry, were authorized in addition to the current two regiments of dragoons and the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen (formed in 1845). One of these new units named \\"The First Cavalry Regiment\\", under the command of Lt. Col. Edwin Vose Sumner, the first regular American military unit to bear that name (in 1861 it was re-designated the 4th Cavalry Regiment). Sumner was previously with the First Dragoons.Chalfant, William Y., Cheyennes and Horse Soldiers, University of Oklahoma Press, 1989. Headquarters for the First Dragoons were moved to Fort Tejon, California, in December 1856, with the various companies scattered throughout the West. For the next five years, the regiment engaged in a variety of Indian fights, seeing action at various times against the Navajos and Apaches in the Southwest and several tribes in the Northwest. On 8 January 1859, B and K Companies fought an engagement with the Mojave in the Mohave Valley and another engagement against the Paiutes on 18–19 April 1860 near present-day Yermo, California. American Civil War =1861–62= Colonel Fauntleroy resigned on 13 May 1861, and was succeeded by Col. Benjamin Lloyd Beall. With the outbreak of the Civil War and the War Department's wanting to re-designate all mounted regiments as cavalry and to renumber them in order of seniority., the First Dragoons became the \\"First Regiment of Cavalry\\" by an Act of Congress on 3 August 1861 (the existing First Cavalry Regiment (formed in 1855) was the fourth oldest mounted regiment in terms of active service, so it was re-designated the 4th Cavalry Regiment). During November and December, the regiment, except Companies D and G, which were still stationed in New Mexico Territory, was transferred by steamship from the Pacific Coast through Panama and then to Washington, D.C., arriving by the end of January 1862. Colonel Beall retired 1 February, and was succeeded by Col. George A.H. Blake. The regiment was attached to the 2d Brigade, Cavalry Reserve, Army of the Potomac. In the meantime, the two companies left in Confederate Arizona had abandoned and destroyed Forts Breckinridge and Buchanan and retreated to Fort Craig. Company D was engaged in a skirmish with Confederates near Fort Craig, on 19 February, and the two companies took part in the Battle of Valverde on 21 February. Company D took part in the engagements at Pigeon's Ranch, 30 March; Albuquerque, 25 April; and Peralta, 27 April. The bulk of the 1st U.S. Cavalry, meanwhile, fought in the Peninsula Campaign in Virginia. At Williamsburg, on 4 May, a squadron under Capt. Benjamin F. \\"Grimes\\" Davis charged and repulsed Confederate cavalry, capturing a flag but losing 13 men. At Gaines' Mill, on 27 June, the regiment lost 26 more men. The regiment participated in fighting at Malvern Hill, Kelly's Ford, and during Stoneman's Raid in April and May. =1863= At the battle of Beverly Ford in June 1863, Davis was killed while in command of the 8th New York Cavalry. At Upperville, the 1st U.S. Cavalry met the Jeff Davis Legion and the 1st and 2d North Carolina regiments in a mounted charge. The regiment lost 53 men (most to saber cuts). At Gettysburg, its loss was 16 men. Several more men were lost in a series of skirmishes during the Confederate retreat to Virginia. In June 1863, the two companies left in New Mexico were broken up. The officers and noncommissioned officers were transferred to Carlisle Barracks, where the companies were reorganized, joining the regiment at Camp Buford, Maryland, in October 1863. After a period of rest and re-equipping near Washington, D.C., the 1st Cavalry rejoined the Army of the Potomac and was engaged at Manassas Junction and at Catlett's Station, on 5 November; Culpeper, on 8 November; Stephensburg, on 26 November, and Mine River. The regiment was employed during the winter doing picket duty along the Rapidan River. =1864= 1st Cavalry at Brandy Station, February 1864 In February, the 1st U.S. Cavalry engaged in a series of fights along the Rapidan line, and then accompanied Brig. Gen. George Armstrong Custer in a raid on Charlottesville, Virginia. On General Sheridan's taking command of the Cavalry Corps, the 1st Cavalry, now commanded by Capt. N. B. Sweitzer, was attached to Merritt's Reserve or Regular Brigade, Torbert's Division, and in the preparation for the Overland Campaign, the regiment was employed in picketing the Rapidan, taking part in the battles of Todd's Tavern, on 7 May, and Spotsylvania Court House, on 8 May. The regiment subsequently accompanied Sheridan on his daring raid around Richmond, fighting at Beaver Dam Station, on 10 May; Yellow Tavern, on 11 May: Meadow Bridge and Mechanicsville, on 12 May; Tunstall's Station, on 14 May; Hawe's Shop, on 28 May; and Old Church, on 30 May. At the Battle of Cold Harbor, on 1 June, the regiment saw severe fighting, losing several men and officers. The 1st Cavalry then accompanied General Sheridan on his Trevilian raid, and lost 35 men in the Battle of Trevilian Station, on 11 and 12 June. The regiment was engaged in daily skirmishing during the return march to White House Landing, and was engaged there on 17 June, at the Chickahominy River on 18 June, and at the battle of Darby's Farm, on 28 June. The 1st Cavalry captured an enemy flag at the battle of Deep Bottom, on 28 July, where the Regular Brigade, fighting on foot, routed a brigade of Confederate cavalry. On 31 July, the 1st Division marched to City Point, embarked on ships the next day, and was transported to Washington, D.C. to assist in repelling the threatened attack of General Early. On 5 August, it moved towards Harpers Ferry, having been ordered to the Shenandoah Valley to rejoin Sheridan. On 10 August, the Reserve Brigade routed Confederates near Winchester. The regiment was then engaged in almost daily skirmishing, and took part in all the important valley battles except Fisher's Hill. From 16 August through 20 August, the 1st Cavalry was employed, together with the whole of the 1st Division, in the destruction of all wheat and forage, and the seizure of all horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs accessible in the valley. The 1st Cavalry took part in the charge of the Reserve Brigade at the Battle of Opequon, on 19 September, and, in conjunction with the 2nd Cavalry, captured two stands of colors and some 200 prisoners. Its casualties were 37 killed, wounded and missing. On 28 September, in an action at Waynesboro, it suffered 18 additional casualties. The 1st Cavalry played an important part in the Battle of Cedar Creek, 19 October. After the surprise and defeat of Horatio G. Wright in the morning, the divisions of Merritt and Custer came up as reinforcements. Two squadrons of the 1st Cavalry formed perpendicular across the Valley Pike and dismounted behind stone walls, the third squadron being held in reserve. This position was held with great difficulty, the advanced squadron being subjected to an enfilading fire. The regiment then returned to Middletown and, during the fall and winter, engaged in numerous skirmishes and took part in Merritt's raid through the Loudoun Valley and Torbert's raid on Gordonsville. In December, the regiment was assigned to duty at the Cavalry Corps headquarters in Winchester. =1865= On 27 February, Sheridan commenced his last expedition through the Shenandoah Valley, wanting to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad and the James River Canal, and capture Lynchburg. The 1st Cavalry took part in the Battle of Waynesboro, on 2 March, where the remnant of Early's army was captured. It was then engaged in many skirmishes during a march from Charlottesville to White House Landing, while destroying locks and the embankment of the James River Canal, railroads and Confederate supplies. It arrived at White House Landing on 17 March, taking part in a sharp engagement that day. The 1st Cavalry was then present in all the major battles of the Cavalry Corps until the close of the war. On 30 March, it was in the engagement on White Oak Road; on 31 March, at Dinwiddie Court House; on 1 April, at Five Forks. There, the regiment charged an entrenched enemy position, carried it and seized 200 prisoners. It also fought on 2 April in the engagement near the Southside Railroad; on 6 April, at the Battle of Sayler's Creek; and on 9 April, at Appomattox Courthouse, the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia. The regiment then returned to Petersburg, where it remained in camp until 24 April, when it marched with the Cavalry Corps towards North Carolina for the proposed junction with Sherman. On the surrender of Joseph E. Johnston's army, the Cavalry Corps returned to Petersburg and the regiment, escorting General Sheridan, left for Washington on 8 May, arriving on 16 May and taking part in the Grand Review of the Armies. Return to frontier Later that month, the regiment was ordered to Louisiana, arriving at New Orleans on 31 May and remaining there until 29 December, when it embarked for California via the Isthmus of Panama. It was stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco on 22 January, with Companies A, G and K going on 5 February to Drum Barracks, where Companies C, D and E, followed them on 17 February, Company L going to Sacramento. In June, regimental headquarters went to Fort Vancouver and the several companies were distributed through Oregon, Washington Territory, Idaho, California, Nevada and Arizona, no two being at the same station. =Snake War= 1866 picture of model showing correct uniform of a Company \\"A\\" 1st US Cavalry SGT wearing Hardee hat From 1866 to 1871, various companies from the 1st Cavalry Regiment were involved in numerous skirmishes involving Indians during the American Indian Wars throughout the west. From 1866 to 1868, they operated in Oregon, Idaho Territory, Nevada, and California fighting the Snake War. Although not defined by one large battle, this series of guerrilla skirmishes and frontier clashes across the high-desert sagebrush plains would be the deadliest Indian War in the West, with 1,762 fatalities.Snake War These skirmishes included an expedition from Fort Bidwell, California, during 22–29 October 1866, when Company A killed 14 Indians, three women, four children, and captured an entire camp. Later that year, LTC George Crook led an expedition of one company of the 1st Cavalry to pursue the Indians in their winter quarters. On 26 December 1866, at the Battle of Owyhee River in Malheur County, Oregon Crook's men caught the Paiutes asleep in their camp.Michno 2003, p.211 However, after the first shots were fired, Chief Howluck determined to stay and fight. The native warriors taunted the soldiers, who returned a deadly accurate fire on the warriors. Quickly into the fighting almost every mounted warrior was shot down. The rest sought refuge behind rocks, remaining there until mid-day when they retreated.Michno 2007, p.194 Continuing his pursuit Crook again encountered the Chief Paulina's Paiute village at Steen's Mountain (named after an early officer of the 1st Dragoons). As Crook ordered the charge his horse bolted and carried him through the native village.Michno 2003, p.194 Nevertheless, his men followed. Despite several close calls for Crook personally, his troopers' fire was accurate and inflicted heavy casualties. A month later Crook's men engaged in one final skirmish before Crook ended the expedition due to bad weather. On the nights of 7–8 February 1867, 25 men of Company B on a patrol were attacked by hostile Indians near Vicksburg Mines in Nevada. On 5 April 1868, Company F killed 32 Indians and captured two near Malheur River, Oregon. Following the Indians south into California, Crook's 1st Cavalry troopers, along with infantrymen from the 23rd Infantry Regiment and 15 Warm Springs and Shoshone scouts encountered a large band of them in an entrenched position. The Native American warriors had made a fortress out of lava rocks in the Infernal Caverns of northern California near the town of Likely. From there they were able to pour a steady fire upon the soldiers commanded by Lt. Col. George Crook. Crook's men attacked on the second day. Despite heavy casualties they managed to scale the cliffs and take the fortifications. Colonel Crook reportedly shot down Chief Sieto himself. Fighting continued into the night as the Native warriors withdrew deeper into the caverns. Crook commented \\"I never wanted dynamite so bad as I did when we first took the fort and heard the diabolical and defiant yells from down in the rocks\\". On the third day the Natives had fled the caverns. =1866–1871= They also fought in the Apache Wars in Arizona Territory from 1866 to 1872. On 29 January 1867, Company M encountered a band of 90 warriors at Stein's Mountain in New Mexico Territory; 60 Indians were killed and 27 captured. From 26 to 31 May 1868, eight men of Company M killed 34 Indians. At Fort McDowell in Arizona on 9–11 December 1869, 20 men from Company E killed an entire band of 11 Mojave Apaches. On 15 December 1870, Colonel Blake was retired from active service on his own application, and Colonel Alvan C. Gillem of the 11th Infantry was transferred to the First Cavalry in his stead. =Modoc War= The Modoc Indians were a small tribe living in northern California near Tule Lake and Lost River. Through the intercession of interested civilians, orders were issued for the Modocs removal to the Klamath Indian Reservation. They went on the reservation, but, on account of ill treatment, left it, and the War Department was then directed to enforce the orders. The Indians at once commenced hostilities and one of the most protracted and obstinate Indian wars of later years followed. Company B left Fort Klamath, on 28 November 1872, for the purpose of arresting \\"Captain Jack\\" and the leaders of his band of Modocs, and at daylight on 29 November surprised the Indians in their camp near the Lost River. The Indians refused to surrender and an engagement followed in which eight Indians were killed and many wounded, and the camp, squaws, and property were captured. The company lost two men killed and six wounded, two of them mortally. The company then went into camp at Crowley's Ranch on Lost River opposite the Indian camp. Company G from Fort Bidwell took station on 13 December at Land's Ranch, Tule Lake, near the Indian stronghold. The Indians attacked this camp on 21 December, and were repulsed, but not until two men and five horses had been killed. Company B now joined Company G and the two companies marched against the Indians on 16 January 1873 in conjunction with General Wheaton's column, with which Company F and a detachment of Company H were also serving at this time. The Indians attacked Companies B and G the same afternoon, but were repulsed, the companies losing three men wounded. The general engagement took place on 17 January, and lasted from 7.30 A.M. to 9.30 P.M., when the troops retired, going finally into camp at Applegate's Ranch near Clear Lake. The regiment lost two men killed and two officers, – Captain Perry and Lieutenant Kyle, – and eight men wounded, one mortally. The Indians attacked a wagon train on 22 January, driving away the escort. However, Captain Reuben F. Bernard, 1st Cavalry, came up with reinforcements and the Indians were repulsed, losing one killed and many wounded. Company K from Fort Halleck, Nev., joined the battalion on 18 February. The battalion now consisted of Companies B, F, G and K, under Captain Biddle, who was soon succeeded by Captain Bernard. Colonel Gillem, 1st Cavalry was commanding the expedition, and Company H joined the column on 10 February. During the night of 14 April, the companies of the 1st Cavalry moved with the rest of the command to invest the Modoc stronghold, and in the Second Battle of the Stronghold, 15–17 April, drove the Indians out of their position and into the rocks and mountains. The 1st Cavalry lost two men killed and two wounded. On 26 April, Companies B and F went to the scene of the \\"Thomas massacre\\" and brought off a number of the wounded and dead. The same companies were attacked by Indians on 10 May, at Sorass Lake, California, but repulsed them with the loss of one warrior killed and two wounded. The command lost one killed and six wounded, two of them mortally. On 17 May, Companies B, G and K, with a battery (serving as cavalry) of the 4th Artillery, all under Major John Green, came upon a band of Modocs, which they drove five miles, killing one and capturing several squaws and children. The troops followed the trail and on 22 May, 70 Indians – men, women and children – surrendered. \\"Boston Charlie\\" was captured on 29 May, and on 31 May \\"Sconchin\\", \\"Scarfaced Charlie\\", and 27 other Indians surrendered. Companies F and H were sent from Applegate's Ranch on 31 May to follow up on those Modocs who had eluded Green's command, finding them on 1 June, when the whole party surrendered. With the capture of \\"Captain Jack\\", the Modoc war ended, and by the end of June the companies that had been engaged in it had returned to their proper stations. The companies left in Arizona were moved north, and by the end of October 1873, headquarters with Companies A and D were at Benicia Barracks; B at Fort Klamath; C at Camp McDermitt, Nev.; E at Fort Lapwai, Idaho Territory -, F, L and M at Fort Walla Walla, Wyoming Territory; G at Camp Bidwell, California.; H and K at Camp Harney, Oregon.; and I at Camp Halleck, Nevada. Colonel Gillem died at his residence in Nashville, Tenn., 2 December 1875, and was succeeded by Colonel Cuvier Grover, promoted from the 3rd Cavalry. =1877 Nez Perce War= On 15 June 1877, Companies F and H, under Captain Perry, were ordered to proceed to Camas Prairie to the assistance of the settlers of Mount Idaho, I. T., who were threatened by the Nez Percé Indians under Chief Joseph. Learning that the Indians were crossing Salmon River and could be taken at a disadvantage, the march was given that direction and Chief Joseph's camp was found and taken by surprise, but the Indians quickly rallied and repulsed the troops with severe loss, Lieutenant E. W. Theller, 21st Infantry (attached), and 33 men being killed and two wounded. All the companies of the regiment, except M at Fort Colville and A at Camp Harney watching the Piutes, were now ordered into the field against the Nez Percés. Companies E and L joined General Howard's command on 21 June; and on 1 July they surprised and attacked the camp of \\"Looking Glass\\" on the Clearwater, I. T. The village was entirely destroyed, several Indians killed and about 1,000 ponies captured. On 2 July, the same command attempted to form a junction with Company F, which was on its way from Lapwai. On 3 July, the Indians ambushed the advanced guard, consisting of Lieutenant S. M. Rains, ten men of the battalion and two civilian scouts, killing them all, and were then found to be in such force and so strongly posted that it was considered imprudent to attack them. The junction with Company F was effected, however, on 4 July, and the same afternoon the Indians attacked, the fight lasting until sunset. The battalion (E, F and L) joined General Howard at Grangerville, on 8 July. Company H had joined on 2 July, and the battalion was commanded by Captain David Perry. On 11 July, General Howard crossed the Clearwater with his whole command and moved down that stream with Company H in advance. The Indian camp was discovered and at once attacked, the fight lasting two days and ending with the retreat of the Indians. Company B joined in time to take part in the fight on 12 July. The regiment lost three men killed and four wounded. The battalion made a reconnaissance on 18 July of the Lo-Lo trail, and the Indian scouts accompanying it were ambushed and met with considerable loss. One Nez Percé was killed. Major Sanford's battalion, consisting of Companies C, D, I and K, joined General Howard on the Clearwater, on 28 July, and the expedition across the Lo-Lo trail began on 30 July. Companies B, C, I and K, under Major Sanford, accompanied it, and Companies D, E, G and L, with other troops under Major Green, constituted the \\"Reserve Column\\", which remained at Camas Prairie until 5 August, when it moved near to Mount Idaho, and established a permanent camp called Camp Howard. Companies F and H were stationed at Fort Lapwai. In the Indian attack at Camas Creek on 20 August, Companies B and L were engaged, losing one man killed and one wounded. At Judith Basin, the battalion was detached from General Howard's command and directed to return, and all the companies had reached their stations by the end of November. Company K and a detachment of C, attached to General Sturgis' command, took part in the engagement with the Nez Percés at Canyon Creek, Montana, on 13 September 1877. =1878= At the outbreak of the Bannock War in May 1878, Company G was the first body of troops to reach the scene of hostilities, and Captain Bernard reported that the Indians numbered from 300 to 500. They were moving towards Steens Mountain (named after Enoch Steen, a former member of the regiment). The whole of the First Cavalry was at once ordered into the field and Colonel Grover sent to Fort Boise to take charge of operations there. Companies D, I and K, were with him. Companies F and L joined Company G on the Owyhee, 17 June, and the three companies reached Camp Harney on 21 June, where they were joined by Company A. These four companies were designated the \\"Left Column\\" by General Howard. On the morning of 23 June, the Left Column struck the main camp of the hostiles on Silver Creek, and drove the Indians out of it and on to a cutbank, made by the creek, which had been prepared for defense. The action lasted into the night and in the morning it was found that the Indians had gone. Many Indians were killed and the camp was destroyed. The battalion lost two killed and three wounded. Company K joined the battalion on 27 June, and on 28 June the cavalry cut loose from the foot troops and pushed forward on the trail of the Indians. The fertile John Day Valley was saved in great part by this vigorous pursuit, and on 5 July General Howard overtook the command, arriving with it at Pilot Rock on 7 July. Here, it was joined by Companies E and H. The Indian camp was located and at sunrise on 8 July Captain Bernard moved his battalion to the attack. About 300 Indians occupied the crest of the high and steep hills near Birch Creek, and were at once attacked. Captain Bernard fought his cavalry on foot without separating the men from the horses. All the companies, except A with the pack train, were deployed and used in the engagement, and the Indians were driven from three successive positions and finally four or five miles further into the mountains. Four men were wounded, one mortally, and probably 20 horses were killed. The enemy's loss is unknown; their women, children and best horses were sent off, seemingly towards the Grande Ronde, before the action began. Lieutenant C. E. S. Wood, A. D. C., wrote: \\"The entire fight was closely watched by the general commanding, who desires to express his opinion that no troops ever behaved better or in a more soldierly manner than did the officers and men engaged in this encounter.\\" The command camped for the night among the rough cañons adjacent to the battle-field. Captain Bernard was then ordered to take his command, except Company K, to Fort Walla Walla to refit. Company K was sent to join the infantry column and with it moved to the Umatilla Agency, near which the hostiles were reported to be. Here the Indians attacked on 13 July. In the ensuing fight, Company K held the right of the line and took part in the final charge by which the Indians were driven off the field and for three miles into the hills. At the request of the Indian Agent, the command moved back to the agency that night, but two days later seven dead Indians were counted upon the battle-field. Companies A, E, F, G, H and I, now under Lieutenant-Colonel J. W. Forsyth, 1st Cavalry, left Fort Walla Walla on 13 July – the day of the fight at Umatilla Agency – in search of the Indians, who were found to be travelling in the direction of John Day River. On 20 July, Forsyth's scouts were ambushed, which caused a halt and deployment of the command, but when the line moved forward the Indians had gone. On 22 July, the battalion reached 11 Burnt Meadows, where it was joined by Companies D and I, under Major Sanford, and on 27 July it went into camp at Malheur Agency to await supplies. The hostiles had now split up into many small parties, which were followed up and nearly all ultimately captured. During the months of September and October, the companies were sent to their permanent stations, and the return for 30 November shows Companies A and E at Camp Harney, Oregon; B, D, F, K and M, at Fort Walla Walla, W. T.; C at Camp Bidwell, California; G at Fort Boise, L T.; H at Fort Colville, W. T.; I at Camp Halleck, Nevada, and L at Fort Klamath, Oregon. =1881= In 1881, Companies C, G, I and M were sent to Arizona, and on 2 October, Company G, with other troops, was in action near Cedar Springs against Apaches. The hostiles fought with great boldness and desperation and the fight lasted until 9 P. M., when the Indians escaped. Company G had two men wounded and 12 horses killed. On 4 October, Companies G and I had a running fight near South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains, in which the hostiles were followed into Sonora, Mexico. In October 1881, the \\"companies\\" began to be designated \\"troops\\" on the Regimental Return. Troop G returned to Fort McDermott on 9 November; Troop I to Camp Halleck on 27 December; Troop M to the Presidio of San Francisco on 20 January 1882; and Troop C to Fort Bidwell on 16 April. =1884–87= In June 1884, the regiment was transferred to the Department of Dakota, after a tour of nearly 30 years on the Pacific coast, during the greater part of which time its stations were remote from civilization and its duties of a most arduous and thankless character. On 5 June 1885, Colonel Grover died at Atlantic City, New Jersey and was succeeded by Colonel N. A. M. Dudley, promoted from the 9th Cavalry. During this time, the headquarters and troops D, G, I, K and M, went to Fort Custer; A, C and F went to Fort Maginnis; E to Fort Ellis; H and L to Fort Assinniboine; and B to Fort Keogh. From 1886 to 1918, Company M, 1st Cavalry was stationed at Fort Yellowstone. Conflict with the \\"Crows\\" came in the fall of 1887, and on the morning of 4 November, Colonel Dudley left Fort Custer with Troops A, B, D, E, G and K, and Company B, 3d Infantry, with a section of Hotchkiss guns, to arrest \\"Sword Bearer\\" and the Indians who had fired into the agency buildings on the night of 30 September. On 5 November, a demand was made upon the Indians for the surrender of these men, and they were given an hour and a half to comply with the demand. At the end of that time, the battalion of the 1st Cavalry, with Moylan's troop of the 7th Cavalry on the right, moved out in front of camp. At the same time, a 'great commotion was observed in the Indian camp, and \\"Sword Bearer\\" and another chief dashed out leading from 120 to 150 warriors equipped for battle. The Indians charged, but were repulsed and fell back into the timber alongside the river, where they had dug many rifle pits from which they now kept up a constant fire. This fire was returned, and \\"Sword Bearer\\" was seen to fall, whereupon all fighting quickly ceased. All the Indians whose surrender had been demanded and who had not been killed were at once brought in and delivered to the Department Commander, who sent them to Fort Snelling. The cavalry battalion returned to Fort Custer on 13 November. =1889–1892= Colonel Dudley was retired from active service on 20 August 1889, and was succeeded by Colonel J. S. Brisbin, promoted from the 9th Cavalry. On 31 December, Headquarters and Troops B, D, E, G and M, were at Fort Custer; A and L at Fort Maginnis; C, F and H at Fort Assinniboine; I at Fort Leavenworth; and K at Camp Sheridan, Wyoming. In April 1890, the Cheyennes assumed a threatening attitude and their agent called on the commanding officer of Fort Custer for protection, who sent Major Carrol with Troops B, D and M to the Tongue River Agency, where they established Camp Crook. In September, a white boy was murdered by \\"Head Chief\\" and \\"Young Mule\\", and every attempt to arrest the murderers failed. On 11 April, the Indians sent word that they would attack the agency and on 12 April made their appearance on a hill commanding the agency buildings, where they opened fire upon them. They were soon dislodged and killed. The regiment took part in the operations against the hostile Sioux in the winter of 1890–1891, but was not brought into actual contact with them. In December 1890, word having been received that a troop of cavalry was surrounded by hostile Indians at or near Cave Hills, Montana, Troop A made one of the most remarkable marches on record in going to its relief. It marched 186 miles, 95 of which were made in 25 hours, and 170 in 53½ hours. The report that caused such tremendous exertion proved to be without foundation. On 22 April 1891, Colonel Brisbin was transferred to the 8th Cavalry with Colonel Abraham K. Arnold who had been the lieutenant colonel and now became the colonel of the First. In 1892, the regiment was transferred to the Department of Arizona, relieving the 10th Cavalry. Headquarters and Troops C, E, F, H and K, going to Fort Grant, Arizona.; B and I to Fort Bayard, New Mexico; D to Fort Apache, Arizona; and G to San Carlos. Troop A was at Fort Myer, Virginia, and was not moved. Medals of Honor During the Indian Wars Owing to the vast extent of country guarded by the regiment, its service for many years following was very arduous. Scouting for Indians and escort duty of various kinds were incessant. During this period, 30 soldiers and officers serving with the regiment earned the Medal of Honor. Eighteen of these awards were for a single engagement against Apaches in the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona, and another six were for actions in George Crook's \\"winter campaign\\" of 1872–73. The recipients were: =Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona, 20 October 1869= * Sergeant Frederick Jarvis, Company G * Trumpeter Bartholomew T.

Parnell (White Bird Canyon, Idaho, 17 June 1877) Spanish–American War In 1898, the US turned its interests to a small island in the Caribbean; Cuba, which was owned by the Spanish Empire. After the exploded in Havana Harbor, the fires of war brewed and the 1st Cavalry was moved to Chickamauga Park, Tennessee on 24 April 1898. The 1st Cavalry and the 10th Cavalry were formed into a cavalry brigade and shipped out to Cuba from Tampa, Florida. However, due to the limited space aboard the SS Leona, the troopers were forced to leave their horses behind. They fought in the Battle of Las Guasimas on 24 June, and at the Battle of San Juan Hill from 1–3 July. During the Siege of Santiago, the 1st Cavalry Regiment earned its 61st battle honor. The 1st Cavalry remained in Santiago until 8 August, and returned to the US where they were garrisoned at Fort Riley, Kansas, then later at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. The Philippines and Border Duty On 19 June 1899, the 1st Cavalry left Ft Robinson for Fort D.A. Russell, Wyoming and began thorough training for new recruits after a brief reorganization period. When the Boxer Rebellion began in China in August 1899, the US Army garrison in the Philippines was moved to Peking to relieve the surrounded legations there, and the 1st Cavalry was sent to the Philippines on 7 August, their horses following four days later. Arriving at Batangas, Luzon on 20 September, they moved to Santo Tomas just south of Manila. They busied themselves with scouting missions, escorting supplies, and patrolling the countryside and villages for guerrilla fighters. In October 1901, a group of insurgents stole some native supplies, so 20 troopers pursued them, reclaimed the goods, and burned the village they were found in, and on 22 October, Troop B captured 5 guerrillas on Mount Makiling. From 18 November-1 December, 35 troopers from the 1st Cavalry took part in the Mount San Cristobal Expedition, which destroyed an enemy supply cache. On 15 March 1902, Troop B killed 5 insurgents on Mount Makiling, and killed 4 more on 19 March. On 16 April, the leader of these guerrillas, General Malvar, surrendered, and hostilities ceased. The 1st Cavalry Regiment was sent back home, and arrived at their new post, Fort Clark, Texas, on 1 October 1903, where they remained for three years. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, 1st Cavalry troopers moved there to assist, and Troop B remained in San Francisco until 9 June 1907 before returning to Texas. The 1st Cavalry Regiment returned to the Philippines in 1908 and garrisoned Fort Stotsenburg for two years. This deployment was much quieter than their last one, and the regiment returned home on 12 February 1910. A, B, D, and K Troops were stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco and later joined the rest of their regiment at the Presidio of Monterey until 1 August 1914. Moving to Southern California, the 1st Cavalry garrisoned San Ysidro in response to growing tensions south of the border in Mexico. On 24 August 1915, the regiment moved to Calexico, California to strengthen the border and defend against raids by the bandito, Pancho Villa. They remained guarding the border while General Pershing launched the Punitive Expedition and were still there when the US entered World War I. The 1st Cavalry did not participate in the First World War, but it remained guarding the border until 19 January 1923, when they went to Fort D. A. Russell, Texas. This was their last posting as horse cavalry, and during a parade on 14 December 1932, the troopers dismounted and passed in review, saluting their horses as they left them to become a mechanized unit. Moving to Fort Knox, Kentucky, the 1st Cavalry Regiment became the first mechanized unit in the United States Army, and was brigaded with the 13th Cavalry Regiment to form the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mecz). In the summer of 1939, 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mecz) took part in the Plattsburgh Maneuvers and helped develop the Army's first tactics for mechanized warfare. In the summer of 1940, the Louisiana Maneuvers convinced the Army of the need to form an armored force and the 1st Armored Division was founded on 15 July 1940. The 1st Cavalry Regiment was redesignated the 1st Armored Regiment that same day, and was assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade. It wouldn't be long until America's fledgling armored force would be tested in battle. World War II The 1st Armored Division was one of the first American units to sail across the Atlantic to do battle with the Axis. Leaving from Fort Dix, New Jersey on 11 April 1942, the Old Ironsides patch set foot on European soil in Northern Ireland on 16 May 1942. Here, they trained with a new intensity as they prepared to go into battle for the first time. At the start of World War Two, 1st Armor was broken up into three Battalions. 1st Battalion consisted of M3 Stuart light tanks, and 2nd and 3rd Battalions consisted of M3 Lee medium tanks. The 1st Armor was commanded by the dynamic COL Peter C. Hains III, an officer whose family was well-known throughout America, and his appointment to command resulted in much gossip from the troops. His grandfather, Peter Conover Hains, was a Major General in the Civil War and was also the chief engineer for building the Tidal Basin in Washington, D. C. and the Panama Canal. His father, Peter C. Hains II, was an infamous Army Captain who killed his wife’s lover in New York City, leading to a sensational trail leading to changes in criminal and matrimonial law nation- wide. COL P. C. Hains III himself competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam in the modern pentathlon. =Algeria-French Morocco= Map showing the movements of the Center Task Force in Operation Torch. Task Force Red can be seen landing east of Oran and driving south to the Tafaraoui airdrome. On 8 November 1942, almost a full year after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Allied American, Free French, and British armies launched Operation Torch, the seaborne invasion of French North Africa. The landing craft available at the time were unable to take the larger M3 Lee tanks, so all the Allied armored support for the initial landings would have to come from the lighter M3 Stuart tanks of 1st Battalion-1st Armored Regiment under the command of LTC John K. Waters (General Patton’s son-in-law). 1-1 Armor was assigned to Task Force (TF) Red under the command of General Lunsford E. Oliver, with the objective of landing east of Oran at Z Beach in the Gulf of Arzew and forming a flying column to push south and seize the Tafaraoui airdrome. Early on the morning of 8 November, the tanks of 1-1 Armor landed and had rapidly driven south, reaching Tafaraoui airdrome at 1100 where they received their first enemy fire in WWII. Vichy French anti-tank guns fired on the column but were quickly outflanked and neutralized by B Co (under CPT William Tuck) and A Co (under CPT Carl Siglin). “The action there only lasted an hour and it was not very intense,” CPT Tuck said. “We considered it intense at the time…. We had a lot to learn.” https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/not-easy-americas-first- tangle-nazi-germanys-deadly-panzer-tanks-148326 The column secured the area and set up roadblocks as the 1st Armored Regiment’s Reconnaissance Platoon (under 1LT William Beckett) mopped-up machine-gun nests and snipers in the area, capturing approximately 300 prisoners in doing so. By the end of D-Day, Tafaraoui airdrome was being used by American aircraft. Task Force Green, to the west of Oran, was running into difficulty seizing La Senia airfield, so A Co, 1-1 Armor was sent to assist them. In the afternoon of 9 November, the Regiment’s first tank-on-tank action was fought when French tanks attacked to retake Tafaraoui airdrome. LT Beckett’s reconnaissance platoon spotted the French tanks at St. Lucien, east of the airdrome, and CPT Tuck’s B Co and a tank destroyer company quickly deployed against them. 1st and 2nd Platoons advanced across the open desert in two Vs abreast while 3rd Platoon provided fire support. Despite their light armor and weaponry, they knocked out 14 French R35 tanks for the loss of 1 NCO killed, and 1 tank temporarily damaged. The next day, American forces were prepared to push into Oran. CPT Siglin’s A Co, 1-1 Armor (now attached to TF Green) moved toward the city from the southwest while TF Red moved in from the southeast. They soon came under fire from French anti-tank guns in Valmy (south of Oran), and C Co, 1-1 Armor (under CPT Rudolph Barlow) was sent to destroy them. The tanks of TF Red did not have time to refuel after the long drive from Tafaraoui, so several ran out of fuel in the middle of the city of Oran, but infantrymen from the 1st Infantry Division were close behind, and they managed to secure the city by 1215. At this point, many of the Vichy French soldiers joined the Free French and the Allied cause, and the Vichy government was dissolved by the Germans. The Vichy soldiers fought halfheartedly against an erstwhile enemy they didn't hate, but the 1st Armored Regiment's next enemy would not be so easy. As the men of 1-1 Armor were busy congratulating themselves, LTC Waters told them “We did very well against the scrub team. Next week we hit German troops. Do not slack off in anything. When we make a showing against them you may congratulate yourselves.” https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/not-easy- americas-first-tangle-nazi-germanys-deadly-panzer-tanks-148326 =Tunisia= After defeating the Vichy French forces in Operation Torch, the 1st Armored Regiment began its fight against the Wehrmacht in Tunisia. In one engagement against a combined German-Italian force, \\"A\\" Company lost six tanks but managed to draw the enemy's fire, allowing \\"B\\" Company to fire into the enemy's vulnerable rear, knocking out six Panzer IVs and one Panzer III before the rest retreated. Two miles to the north, Axis infantry was observed dismounting from vehicles and the remaining tanks of Companies A and B advanced on them and destroyed the enemy force. =Naples-Foggia= In November 1943, the 1st Armored Regiment, as a part of the 1st Armored Division, moved to Italy and fought in the Naples-Foggia Campaign, the Allied drive to Monte Cassino. The winter months in Italy were mired in mud and stalemate. The rains and stiff German resistance on river and mountain-top defensive lines halted Allied progress. =Anzio= In late January 1944, the 1st Armored Regiment landed in Anzio as part of the Allied operation to outflank the German Winter Line. The armored forces broke through the German encirclement on 24 May 1944 after heavy fighting. =Rome-Arno= After participating in the liberation of Rome on 5 June 1944, the 1st Armored Division was pulled off the frontline and reorganized under a new table of organization. The 1st Armored Regiment was redesignated as the 1st Tank Battalion. =North Apennines= The division was placed back onto the line and the 1st Tank Battalion steadily advanced north and crossed the Arno on 1 September. This river crossing was followed by bloody stalemate in the North Apennines, where the rough and cold terrain hindered tank operations. =Po Valley= Their final action in the Second World War was the Po Valley Campaign, where they fought from 21–26 April 1945. The 1st Tank Battalion was deactivated after VE Day. Post-War When the Korean War began, the Army began re-mobilizing. 1st Battalion, 1st Armored Regiment was reactivated as the 1st Tank Battalion at Fort Hood, Texas and 2nd Battalion, 1st Armored Regiment was activated as the 100th Tank Battalion and trained until they were combined together on 15 February 1957 at Fort Polk, Louisiana to reform the 1st Cavalry Regiment. Company A, 100th Tank Battalion, was inactivated at Polk on 15 February 1957, and then redesignated as HHC 4th Medium Tank Battalion, 1st Cavalry on 15 May 1958, concurrently assigned to the United States Military Academy and activated at West Point, New York. By 29 December 1966 it was redesignated 4th Squadron, 1st Cavalry.Army Lineage Series: Armor-Cavalry: Part 1, Office of the Chief of Military History, 1966, p100. Vietnam An M48 tank of \\"A\\" Troop, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry, is stuck in mud and water during an operation 15 km northeast of Hill 29, 2 August 1968 On 8 March 1965, US Marines landed at Da Nang, marking the beginning of the conventional American ground war in the country of South Vietnam. Aiming to eliminate the communist Viet Cong insurgents and their North Vietnamese Army backers, US military presence in the country steadily escalated. By 1967, roughly 485,600 American troops were in country, and the disparate Squadrons of the 1st Cavalry Regiment were soon to enter the fray. =1st Squadron= In August 1967, the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment (1-1 Cavalry) was detached from the 1st Armored Division and sent to Vietnam attached to US Army Pacific. On deployment to Vietnam in 1967, the squadron consisted of three armored cavalry troops and one air cavalry troop, D Troop, which was not deployed until July 1968. 'D' Troop, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment was shipped to Vietnam with its aircraft to join its parent unit, which was already in Vietnam attached to the Americal Division at Chu Lai. En route, D Troop's orders were changed, temporarily attaching it to the 101st Airborne Division. The troop disembarked at Da Nang on 21 July 1968 and flew directly to Camp Eagle. The Troop then remained on combat duty in I Corps for the next four years and used the call sign Sabre. 1-1 Cavalry served in Chu Lai, Đà Nẵng, Tam Kỳ, and Thach Khe. On 15 April 1966 Troop E, 1st Cavalry was activated as the brigade reconnaissance troop of the 11th Infantry Brigade at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. Troop E arrived in Vietnam on 19 December 1967 and participated in extensive ground combat in Quảng Ngãi and Quang Tin provinces through eleven campaigns, receiving the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry for service in 1969–1970 with the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 23rd Infantry Division (Americal). Troop E was inactivated in Vietnam on 13 November 1971. They departed Vietnam on 10 May 1972. =2nd Squadron= On 1 July 1963, the 2nd Squadron, 1st Cavalry was relieved of their duties to the 3rd Armored Division, United States Army, Europe and reassigned to the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas. On 8 August 1967, the unit left Fort Hood for Vietnam where they were attached to the 4th Infantry Division, headquartered in Pleiku. During their service in the Central Highlands, troopers saw action in Pleiku, Đắk Tô, Suoi Doi, Kon Tum, An Khê and many other nameless stretches of road and jungle. In May 1969, the squadron was transferred to Task Force South in Phan Thiết and was attached to the 1st Field Force, Vietnam. Now operating in the rice paddies and rubber plantations of Vietnam, the Blackhawks further distinguished themselves in actions around Phan Thiết, Song Mao, Phan Rang and their environs. 2-1 Cavalry departed Vietnam in October 1970, leaving Cam Ranh Bay for reassignment to the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas. =7th Squadron= 7th Squadron (Air), 1st Cavalry was a self-contained Vietnam-era air cavalry squadron, made up of five troops. Headquarters and Headquarters Troop (callsign Kingbird/Blackhawk), Alpha Troop (callsign Apache), Bravo Troop (callsign Dutch Master), Charlie Troop (callsign Sand Piper/Comanche) and Delta Troop (Powder Valley/Dragoon). D Troop (the squadron's armored cavalry troop) participated in successful night ambushes, escorted convoys, search and clear missions and other ground operations until the U.S. 9th Div was withdrawn from Vietnam. After that the offensive mission of D Troop was taken away and they were used to train the South Vietnamese Regional Force infantry units of the 44th Special Zone (STZ) in air assault missions, which were quite successful. The 44th STZ protected a region along the Cambodian border to the north. Troops A, B and C were Air Cavalry units. When the U.S. 9th Division was returned to the US, their Air Cavalry Troop, D/3 3-5th Cav, was added to the 7-1st Cav, bringing the number of Air Cavalry Troops to 4. This was the largest Air Cav Squadron in Vietnam. Equipped to perform scout, insertion, interdiction and attack missions, the troops supported the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 21st, 9th, 7th Divisions and the 44 STZ. The Squadron was initially attached to the 12th Aviation Group, then from 3 June 1968, to the 164th Aviation Group. In 1970, when President Nixon approved a US/ARVN assault into Cambodia, the squadron, with 4 Air Cav troops abreast formed the advanced guard for the 3 ARVN Divisions. After several weeks in Cambodia, all the units returned to the Delta where enemy activities dropped to an all-time low. In April 1972, 7-1 Cavalry was assigned to the 194th Armored Brigade, Fort Knox, Kentucky. In 1976, the unit was inactivated and used to form air cavalry troops in the reactivated 5th, 7th and 24th Infantry Divisions. All US combat troops were withdrawn by 30 November 1972. Arctic Cavalry On 31 December 1972 Troop E was reactivated as a separate air cavalry reconnaissance troop and assigned to the 172nd Infantry Brigade at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. It was inactivated on 15 March 1987. It was reactivated on 16 April 1998 as a ground reconnaissance troop at Fort Wainwright with the 172nd Infantry Brigade and inactivated on 15 November 2003. On 16 December 2006, Troop E, 1st Cavalry Regiment was reorganized, redesignated and activated as Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 5th Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment (organic squadron elements concurrently constituted and activated) and assigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Team (Stryker), 25th Infantry Division at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. The Cold War Inner German Iron Curtain Border Surveillance Mission 1978–1991 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment returned to Europe and the 1st Armored Division, VII Corps taking up another frontier mission in December 1978 in the surveillance of the international \\"Iron Curtain\\" border between the Federal Republic of Germany and Czechoslovakia. As the \\"Eyes & Ears\\" of the 1st Armored Division based out of its Garrison at O'Brien Barracks in Schwabach, FRG, the Line Troops (A - \\"Alpha\\", B \\"Bravo\\", C \\"Charlie\\") rotated on a 30 to 45-day cycle through 1-1 Cavlary's Border Camp Pitman in Weiden, FRG between Field Training Exercises (FTX), Unit Gunnery Exercises and augmentations of other Border Cavalry Camps along the Inner German Cold War Iron Curtain Border with East Germany and Czechoslovakia. During this border surveillance mission period the line Troops were often typically deployed from their O'Brien Barracks Garrison for around 9 to 10 Months each year participating in various FTX's, REFORGER's (Return of Forces to Germany), Unit Gunnery Exercises, Border Tours and Augmentations. In 1988 the Squadron moved Garrison to Katterbach, FRG and the unit eventually gained additional aviation elements to help support its mission. As part of the move and conversion from H Series Cavalry configuration to J Series Cavalry configuration, C Troop was dropped as a ground Troop and became one of the new Aviation Troops (C & D) added. Gulf War and Balkans When Sadaam Hussein's Iraq invaded Kuwait precipitating the Gulf War, the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment moved to Saudi Arabia from their bases in Germany and into the line by 8 January 1991. The 1st Armored Division was in a wedge for the advance forward, and 1-1 Cavalry was at the \\"sharp end\\" of the wedge. On 24 February, the 1st Cavalry led the way across the border and covered 244 kilometers in the enemy's rear during 89 hours of sustained combat operations. 1-1 Cavalry helped destroy 4 Iraqi divisions along the way, 3 of which were members of the vaunted Republican Guard. The squadron sustained no fatalities and a limited number of wounded, and only lost two M3A2 Bradley fighting vehicles. 1-1 Cavalry was involved in Operation Joint Endeavor beginning 20 December 1995 in the Balkans. A Troop 1-1 Cavalry was First Unit across the Sava River during the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. The 1st Squadron returned to Büdingen, Germany on 17 November 1996. Meanwhile in New York State, by 1996 the 4th Squadron was listed among the Regular Army regiments, located at West Point, but as \\"inactive.\\" War on Terror In April 2003, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment and other regimentally affiliated units of the 1st Armored Division moved to Kuwait to begin staging for the Operation Iraqi Freedom. In March 2003, The Squadron conducted a Relief in Place of 3-7 Cavalry (3ID) in Baghdad and assumed operations. The Air Cavalry Troops of the Squadron (D, E, & F) were attached to 1st Battalion, 501st Attack Regiment in order to provide Reconnaissance and Security to the entirety of forces in an around the greater Baghdad area. H troop, Brigade Reconnaissance Troop (a separate but regimentally affiliated unit) and the Squadron conducted operations in and around Baghdad for the next 16 months (due to an involuntary extension imposed on them 2 weeks prior to their scheduled flight home at the 12-month mark). The Air Cavalry Troops earned the Meritorious Unit Commendation medal, the Presidential Unit Citation, and the Valorous Unit Award for their contributions. From March 2007-May 2008 3-1 Cavalry deployed with 3-3ID East of Bagdad at FOB Hammer in support of President Bush's \\"Surge\\". From September 2008 – September 2009, 5-1 Cavalry was deployed to the eastern Diyala Governorate in Iraq. From April 2011–April 2012, 5-1 Cavalry deployed to Kandahar Province in Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

Number 4 was one of 32 towns established on the same day through the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Now known as Charlestown, Plantation Number 4 was more than from the nearest other British settlement at Fort Dummer. Settlement of the town began in 1740 by brothers Stephen, Samuel and David Farnsworth. By 1743, there were 10 families settled at Number 4. The fortification within Number 4 was established in 1744 when the people of the town voted to move several of their homes to created a fortified section of the town. The \\"fort\\" was a rectangle of six houses connected with lean-tos. The southern end of the fort consisted of a two-story structure with a Great Hall on the second floor and an attached guard tower. The only gate into the fortification lay below the Great Hall and was flanked by a small stable to the east and a guard house to the west. Three sides of the fortification were enclosed in a stockade, which continued on the southwest side of the fort to enclose and protect an existing well.  King George's War  In 1744, during King George's War, many of the area's outlying farms and buildings were burned by the French and their Indian allies. Some settlers, along with some Indian warriors, were killed in ambushes and small skirmishes. Other settlers were taken prisoner, to be ransomed back in Canada. The settler families would all but abandon the fort in the fall of 1746; a small contingent of men stayed on at the fort until February if 1747. The fortification was later reoccupied by Capt. Phineas Stevens and 30 militia men in late March of 1747. On April 7, 11 days after Capt. Stevens and his men arrived, the fort was besieged by a force combining French militia and Abenaki warriors under the command of Ensign Boucher de Niverville of the French Marines. The siege lasted three days, until the French and Indians decided to head back to Canada rather than risk a direct attack on the fort, thus preventing further raids on settlements to the south and east. Reports of the incident claimed the sieging force was more than 500 strong, with numbers growing to over 700 as the story was repeated. French accounts of the siege put the number of Natives and accompanying French closer to 50 individuals. Commodore Charles Knowles of the Royal Navy, whilst Governor of Louisburg visiting Boston, was so impressed that he presented Stevens with “as costly and elegant a sword as could be procured in Boston”. Afterwards the township was named Charlestown in honour of Charles Knowles, later Admiral Sir Charles Knowles Baronet. The New England Historical and genealogical Register Vol XXVIII. Boston. 1874 pp.463  French and Indian War  One Indian raid made into the town in August 1754, immediately prior to the French and Indian War, led to the capture of Susanna Willard Johnson and her family, most of whom were eventually sold into slavery. Following Johnson's release several decades later, she wrote a popular captivity narrative of her ordeal. During the last of the French and Indian Wars, many soldiers were stationed in the Fort at Number 4 to protect the frontier. They included Colonel Nathan Whiting's Regiment of Connecticut, and Colonel John Goffe's New Hampshire Provincial Regiment. Returning from a raid on St. Francis, Quebec, Robert Rogers in 1759 sought help here for his hungry Rangers at Fort Wentworth far up the Connecticut River. Also at that time, General Jeffery Amherst ordered a road to be built between the fort and another fort newly captured at Crown Point, located on the shores of Lake Champlain in New York. Consequently, Capt. John Stark and a company of Rangers, together with Col. Goffe's Regiment, built the Crown Point Military Road. It was long, with many blockhouses along its route to protect supplies and travelers through the wilderness that would later become Vermont. With the defeat of the French in 1761, and the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the need for the fort ended.  American Revolution  Although the fort no longer existed, General John Stark gathered the New Hampshire Militia regiments at its site while traveling to the Battle of Bennington in 1777.  Today  The Fort at Number 4 is now an open air museum that has been recreated in Charlestown, New Hampshire, to depict its appearance during King George's War. A group of historians and enthusiasts portray the settlers and town militia. During most summers, the fort hosts both French and Indian War and American Revolutionary War reenactments.

The ride was poorly received, and was closed in less than a year. History The original concept for the attraction was to make riders into celebrities attempting to evade paparazzi on a wild high-speed ride through Hollywood. Reportedly, video clips of Michael Eisner (in his official role at the time as Disney chairman and chief executive officer) would have book-ended the ride. At the start, he would greet riders as they arrived at Los Angeles International Airport, remind them they had not yet signed their big contract with Disney, and promise he would be waiting at Grauman's Chinese Theatre with the contract after they escaped the paparazzi. At the end, he would appear again to politely explain the riders had been caught by paparazzi cameras and therefore the contract was void, then riders would exit into the attached gift shop, where tabloid newspapers featuring their photographs (as taken during the chase) would be available for purchase. The unexpected death of Princess Diana in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997 forced Walt Disney Imagineering to radically redesign the ride. Since paparazzi had been following Diana at the time of her crash, a ride built around the tendency of paparazzi to chase celebrities at high speed \\"was rendered incredibly tasteless.\\" Eisner was replaced with a fictional Hollywood agent, and the ride was dramatically slowed down. Visual gags intended to be absorbed at high speed no longer made sense, so the ride was packed with celebrity figures to compensate for the change in pacing. Superstar Limo was situated in the Hollywood Pictures Backlot area and was one of the original attractions featured on the park's opening day on February 8, 2001. The ride included figures of celebrities which were stylized and caricatured. Though they had moving arms and heads, none of Disney's human- like Audio-Animatronics technologies were used in the attraction. The attraction closed in January 2002, due to poor reception, making it the park's first attraction to permanently close. It has since been replaced by an attraction based on Disney·Pixar's Monsters, Inc. entitled Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue!, which opened on January 23, 2006. The Monsters, Inc. ride uses the same track layout as Superstar Limo, with taxicabs taking the place of the original limos. In the 2019 documentary series The Imagineering Story, Bruce Vaughn, Chief Creative Executive (2007–2016) of Walt Disney Imagineering, described the creation of Superstar Limo as an example of Imagineering's failure to make the original California Adventure park work: Synopsis The attraction's purple \\"stretch limo\\" ride vehicles took riders through a cartoony rendition of Hollywood. Riders were introduced to animated figures modeled in the likeness of celebrities. The celebrities in the attraction were Joan Rivers (appearing only in puppet-form on TV screens in the attraction's queue), Regis Philbin, Melanie Griffith, Antonio Banderas, Cindy Crawford, Tim Allen, Jackie Chan, Drew Carey, Cher, and Whoopi Goldberg. A stereotypical Hollywood talent agent named Swifty La Rue appeared infrequently on small in-seat video screens, reminding the riders not to be late to their movie premiere. The story of the attraction placed the guest (rider) as Hollywood's newest celebrity, taking them through a variety of stereotypical locations and situations on the way to the premiere of their new movie. Locations included the greater Los Angeles and Hollywood areas including Rodeo Drive, the Sunset Strip, Bel Air, Malibu, the interior of a soundstage, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and a billboard that displayed an image captured of the guests. The ride ends with the talent agent declaring to the riders that their movie was a success and they are a superstar. Criticism Superstar Limo was criticized as lacking and poor in concept. Theme park reporter Brady MacDonald summed up the attraction as \\"a prime example of offensive theme park design.\\" An early review of California Adventure by Anne Chalfant in The Boston Globe cited Superstar Limo as an example of the park's budget-cutting beginnings: \\"Kids will also like Superstar Limo, in the Hollywood Pictures Backlot area. Here you play the star, riding in your purple limo past a few audio-animatronic Hollywood celebrities. Adults will notice, however, that other painted plywood characters and sets are about on a par with college theater constructions.\\" Similarly, James Sterngold of The New York Times called it \\"probably the shlockiest attraction in the new park.\\" A lengthy article by David Rorden in the Longview Daily News giving a mostly favorable review of the then-new theme park singled out Superstar Limo as a mistake, calling attention to the self-promotion in featuring stars like Drew Carey, who appeared on a sitcom aired on the Disney-owned network ABC: \\"I think they should change the name of this ride from Superstar Limo to 'It's a Shill World.' The space would be better devoted to something more entertaining, such as an Audioanimatronic dentist doing root canals on all Imagineers who came up with the idea for Superstar Limo.\\" See also *List of former Disney California Adventure attractions References Amusement rides introduced in 2001 Amusement rides that closed in 2002 Amusement rides manufactured by Ride & Show Engineering, Inc.

The project was initially developed by the USSR Academy of Sciences (now the Russian Academy of Sciences) along with Design Bureau Lazurith. Later two vehicles were ordered from Finland. The Mir 1 and Mir 2, delivered in 1987, were designed and built by the Finnish company Rauma- Repola's Oceanics subsidiary. The project was carried out under the supervision of constructors and engineers of the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology. Characteristics The vessels are designed to be used for scientific research. They might also be used to assist in submarine rescue operations, although they do not have the capacity to take anybody aboard when underwater. The carrier and command centre of both Mir submersibles is the R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. The two Mir units are operated by the Russian Academy of Sciences. The Mir submersibles can dive to a maximum depth of 6,000 metres (19,685 ft). Traditionally, the personnel sphere of a deep sea submersible is manufactured of titanium plates that are welded together. On Mir, the personnel sphere is made of a maraging steel alloy that has ten percent better strength/weight ratio than titanium.Metallitekniikka 22.10.2003, re-published 5.12.2008: CIA tuhosi Rauma-Repolan parhaan bisneksen , English summary in Helsingin Sanomat 22.10.2003 This alloy contains about 30% cobalt and smaller amounts of nickel, chrome and titanium. Two hemispheres were made by casting and machining, and then bolted together, thus avoiding welded joints. The resulting construction is close to the density of water, thus making it easier to move in different depths. Additional buoyancy is provided by of syntactic foam. Unlike other Deep Submergence Vehicles that use iron ballast to reach the ocean floor, the buoyancy and depth is adjusted by ballast tanks. * The Mir submersibles are 7.8 m long, 3.6 m wide, 3.0 m high, and weigh 18,600 kg (maximum payload is 290 kg). The personnel sphere's walls are 5 cm thick, and the inside diameter of the working area is 2.1 m. Three viewports are provided (viewport material is 18 cm thick): the forward-facing port is 20 cm diameter; the two side-facing ports are 12 cm diameter each. * Power is provided by NiCad batteries of 100 kWh capacity. Electric motors drive hydraulic pumps to actuate hydraulic manipulators and 3 propulsors. The aft hydraulic propulsor is rated at 9 kW and 2 side propulsors are rated at 2.5 kW each. Maximum underwater speed is 5 knots. * Longitudinal trim is controlled using 2 spherical water ballast tanks, fore and aft. Water can be forced out of these tanks as required by using compressed air. * Air pressure inside the cabin remains at a constant one atmosphere: the air is recycled in a manner similar to that used on board spacecraft, with lithium hydroxide scrubbers removing accumulated carbon dioxide. * VHF radio is used to maintain communication with the surface. The units contain imaging sonar units of 250 metre range, so nearby objects can be visualized and their distance measured. The distance to the seabed can also be accurately measured when nearing touchdown. * The units' life-support systems have 246 man-hour capacity, or 3.42 days for a three-person crew. * The units are designed for pressure at 6,000 metre depth, and have been tested to 125% of that pressure. In field testing, Mir-1 descended to 6,170 m and Mir-2 descended to 6,120 m. * Originally the hydraulic manipulators were covered by a helmet-like retractable see-through visor, but these were removed in a major overhaul in 1994. * The submersibles change depth at a maximum vertical speed of 40 meters per minute, so several hours are required to travel to and from deep sites. Finnish-Soviet co-operation Production of the two Mir units was a prime example of Finnish-Soviet economic and technical co-operation during the Cold War. Bids from Canada, France and Sweden to construct the submarines had been retracted most likely due to political pressure. In a later interview with STT the then Rauma-Repola department head Peter Laxell said he believed that \\"Finland got the permit to deliver the crafts to the Soviets on the basis that the CoCom officials in the USA believed the project would be a failure . . . Once it became clear to them we actually had accomplished the engineering feat there was a huge uproar about how such technology could be sold to the Soviets, enough for many visits to the Pentagon.\\".Helsingin Sanomat / STT 02.08.2007 \\"MIR - Suomalainen saavutus ja kylmän sodan pelinappula.\\" Article name translates to: \\"MIR - A Finnish accomplishment and piece in the cold-war game\\" Because of the CoCom restrictions, most of the technology used had to be developed in Finland. The electronics was developed by Hollming. The syntactic foam was produced in Finland by Exel Oyj, as 3M, the leading producer, refused to supply their product. The construction, including casting, was done by Lokomo (a Rauma-Repola subsidiary) in Tampere, Finland. The level of technology flowing into the Soviet Union raised concern in the US and Rauma- Repola was privately threatened with economic sanctions. For example, one concern of the Pentagon was the possibility that the Soviet Union would manufacture a pioneer submarine fleet that could clear the ocean floor of US deep sea listening equipment. With the possibility of losing its lucrative offshore oil platforms market Rauma-Repola yielded, and submarine development ceased in Finland. One project that was abandoned was the development of a fuel cell based air-independent propulsion system. The 122 m length support vessel R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh was also built in Finland, at the Hollming shipyard in Rauma in 1980 (later operated by STX Finland, closed in 2014). Expeditions =Titanic and Bismarck filming= In the mid 1990s and early 2000s, the Mir vehicles were used by Canadian film director James Cameron to film the wreck of the RMS Titanic, resting at a depth of 3,821 metres, for his 1997 film Titanic and documentaries such as Ghosts of the Abyss, and to film the wreck of the German battleship Bismarck, resting at a depth of 4,700 metres, for his 2002 documentary film Expedition: Bismarck. =2007 North Pole submersion= On August 2, 2007 Russia used the Mir submersibles to perform the first manned descent to the seabed under the Geographic North Pole, to a depth of 4,261 m, to scientifically research the region in relation to the 2001 Russian territorial claim. The Mir-1 crew: pilot Anatoly Sagalevich; polar explorer Arthur Chilingarov; and Vladimir Gruzdev. The Mir-2 crew were international: Russian pilot Yevgeny Chernyaev; Australian Mike McDowell; Swede Frederik Paulsen.

International scepticism regarding the Russian mission was put forward by Peter MacKay, Canada's foreign minister, and Tom Casey, deputy spokesman of the US State Department, who argued that Russian claim of the Arctic has no legal standing. Mistaken controversy A short time after announcement of the polar expedition, some newspapers tried to stir up controversy by claiming the expedition was fake because some of the footage was from James Cameron's movie Titanic. A Russian television network had used the Titanic footage (for which it holds the copyright) as an illustration of the deep-sea vessels in action. They had shown this hours before the Mir submersibles had arrived on the Arctic seabed, and they had pointed out that the footage was from the movie, not a transmission from the site. Reuters did not note this information when it carried the story, and used the pictures wrongly captioned. Reuters later apologized and issued a statement reading in part: \\"Reuters mistakenly identified this file footage as originating from the Arctic, and not the North Atlantic where the footage was shot\\", and they reposted the story with correct captions.Reuters gets that sinking feeling. MediaGuardian August 10, 2007 Reposted Reuters story with correct captions =2008–2010 Expedition to Lake Baikal= In July 2008 both Mir submersibles began a two-year expedition to Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater reservoir.

They focus on the areas of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as ensuring quality services and prevention of risks to the patients, and members of the public in general. A medical physicist plays a fundamental role in applying physics to medicine, but particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The scientific and technological progress in medical physics has led to a variety of skills that must be integrated into the role of a medical physicist in order for them to perform their job. The \\"medical services\\" provided to patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic treatments must, therefore, be the result of different but complementary skills.Guibelalde E., Christofides S., Caruana C.

The European Federation of Organisations for Medical Physics(EFOMP) has defined a detailed inventory of learning outcomes for Medical Physics Experts in terms of Knowledge, Skills and Competences (the latter in Europe means 'responsibilities'). In Europe the professional preparation for Medical Physicists typically consists of a first degree in Physics or equivalent (e.g., biophysics, electrical or mechanical engineering, computing), a Masters in Medical Physics and a 2-year training Residency. The European Commission has produced 'European Guidelines on the Medical Physics Expert'. United Kingdom From October 2011 as part of the Modernising Scientific Careers scheme, the route to accreditation as a medical physicist in England and Wales is provided by the Scientist Training Programme (STP). This scheme is a three- year graduate program provided by the National School of Healthcare Science. Entrants are required to have an undergraduate degree (first or upper second class honours) in an appropriate physical science prior to this three-year graduate program. The STP involves a part-time MSc in Medical Physics (provided by either King's College London, University of Liverpool or Newcastle University) in addition to practical training within the National Health Service. Assessment is provided by the completion of competencies and by a final assessment similar to the OSCE undertaken by other clinical staff. Completion of the STP leads to accreditation with the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM) and registration as a Clinical Scientist. Prior to 2011 the training route in the United Kingdom was administered in two parts, and this scheme is still used in Scotland and Northern Ireland. NHS Careers Website. Retrieved 2014-03-18.).

Born in Detroit, Eisley played college basketball at Boston College and was drafted in 1994 by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Eisley spent twelve seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA): six with the Utah Jazz (1995–2000, 2004–2005) and the other six with seven other teams. Early life and college Eisley graduated from Southwestern High School in Detroit, where he was teammates with future NBA players Jalen Rose and Voshon Lenard, and played for the Boston College Eagles basketball team for four years before being drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round (30th overall) in 1994. He graduated from Boston College with a degree in communications. In his senior season, Eisley led the Eagles to the eastern regional finals or \\"Elite Eight\\" round of the 1994 NCAA tournament and earned regional All-Tournament honors. Career As a rookie in 1994–95, Eisley started in four games for the Timberwolves out of 34. With average playing time of 14.6 minutes per game, Eisley averaged 3.3 points and 2.3 assists. On February 26, 1995, Eisley signed the first of two 10-day contracts with the San Antonio Spurs. He signed for the rest of the season on March 18, and was released on April 14. In 15 games and 56 minutes with the Spurs, Eisley recorded 7 points and 18 assists. Eisley began the next season with the Rockford Lightning of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) before signing with the Utah Jazz, who sought a point guard to back up John Stockton and to replace the injured Jamie Watson. Previously, Eisley was the final player cut from Jazz training camp. By December 1995, Eisley had the top free throw percentage (17 for 17) in the CBA. In seven games with the Lightning, Eisley improved his performance: in 24 minutes per game, he averaged 12.4 points and 3.3 assists. Jazz coach Jerry Sloan commented that Eisley was \\"a focused young man\\" and: \\"So many people play with their athletic ability alone and forget to play with the other people on the court. He's adjusted as quickly to what we're doing as anybody we've had.\\" Eisley was known for his quiet manner. In the first half of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals, Eisley made a 3-point shot that replays clearly showed was released before the shot clock expired. Referee Dick Bavetta mistakenly disallowed the shot. (This game took place four years before the NBA instituted instant replay to review calls.) The Chicago Bulls would beat the Utah Jazz in that game 87-86 and win the championship series four games to two. He was traded to the Dallas Mavericks during the 2000 season. He was traded to the New York Knicks in 2001. He was traded to the Phoenix Suns in 2003. On November 3, 2004, the first day of the regular season for the Utah Jazz, Eisley signed a $1.1 million, one-year contract with the team, for which he played five seasons from 1995 to 2000. He scored four points and made three assists, and the Jazz beat the Los Angeles Lakers 104-78. In 74 games, Eisley averaged 19.3 minutes, 5.6 points, 1.2 rebounds, and 3.4 assists. Among his milestones in his comeback season with the Jazz included his 700th career game (December 12, 2004 against the Portland Trail Blazers), 5,000th career point (April 15, 2005 against the Minnesota Timberwolves), and a career-high eight defensive rebounds (February 1, 2005 against the Charlotte Bobcats). In 19 games, Eisley led the Jazz in assists. 2005–06 was Eisley's final NBA season; he played in the Los Angeles Clippers and Denver Nuggets this season. On November 17, 2005, Eisley signed as a free agent with the Clippers. In 13 games with the Clippers, Eisley averaged 0.7 points, 1.1 rebounds, and 1.9 assists. The Clippers, having experimented with a three-guard lineup as Corey Maggette was out due to injury, released Eisley on January 3, 2006. Following two 10-day contracts, the Nuggets kept Eisley for the rest of the season from March 23, 2006. With the Nuggets, Eisley played in 19 games and averaged 4.8 points, 1.0 rebounds, and 2.3 assists. On July 20, 2006, the Nuggets traded Eisley to the Chicago Bulls, but the Bulls later waived him. In 2010, Eisley became a player development assistant for the Los Angeles Clippers. He was hired as an assistant coach for the Washington Wizards on September 4, 2014. Following a three year stint as an assistant with the New York Knicks, Eisley joined Juwan Howard's staff at the University of Michigan as an assistant coach.

It was set up to investigate allegations that the system of government, private, and non-governmental organizations responsible for supplying blood and blood products to the health care system had allowed contaminated blood to be used.  Background  Since the 1940s, the blood system had largely been the responsibility of the Canadian Red Cross Society. This independent charitable body supplied donated blood to hospitals or, if the blood was past its expiry date, gave it to Connaught Laboratories, the major producer of blood products in Canada. Connaught had initially been a non-profit company operated by the University of Toronto; by the 1980s it had been sold into the private sector. In the late 1970s a crisis emerged. Thousands of people were being infected with HIV and Hepatitis C. It became apparent that inadequately screened blood, often coming from high risk populations, was entering the system.  Recommendations  The Krever Report was tabled in the House of Commons on 26 November 1997. The Krever inquiry recommended the creation of Héma-Québec for Quebec and Canadian Blood Services for rest of the Canada, two agencies which would operate at arm's length from the federal government.

Tokyopop's localized volumes appeared on ICv2's monthly top three-hundred selling graphic novels. English reviewers have praised the series' humor with mixed reaction to the plot and characters. Plot Akira Uehara volunteers to deliver homework to Nanako Momoi, his classmate and crush. At Nanako's home, her grandfather's invention causes Akira and Nanako to exchange bodies; the invention is destroyed shortly after its use. Nanako is thrilled with the exchange as it complements her tomboy personality; she begins dating her friend Makoto Shiina. Meanwhile, Akira's effeminate personality combined with Nanako's beauty garners the courtship of his friend, Shinnosuke Senbongi, to his discomfort. The series continues episodically and focuses on Akira's deteriorating resolve to return to his body and his hesitation in reconciling Shinnosuke's feelings. Eventually, Akira decides to accept the new status quo but a new invention unintentionally reverses the exchange; the invention is destroyed after its use once again and Nanako's grandfather becomes amnesiac. On the behest of Akira and the friends, Shinnosuke begins researching on how to build a machine to reenact the exchange. Eight years later, Shinnosuke succeeds allowing the four to reunite with their respective lovers. =Main characters= ; :Akira is an effeminate male with a crush Nanako Momoi. After exchanging bodies with her, his personality and Nanako's feminine appearance causes his popularity to soar. His best friend, Shinnosuke Senbongi, learns his secret and becomes enamored with his new appearance. Initially, Akira was adamant on returning to his body and maintaining his masculinity. During the series, he reluctantly reconciles Shinnosuke's feelings and upon realizing everyone is happier with the new status quo, resigns to live in Nanako's body. He is voiced by Kenji Nojima in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Shun Shioya in the live action film. ; :Nanako is an extreme tomboy with an insensitive personality. Like Akira Uehara, she becomes popular with the students and Akira's parents after the exchange due to her personality and Akira's masculine appearance.

She resolves to stay in Akira's body and relents her body's ownership to Akira after she falls completely in love with her friend, Makoto Shiina. Her parents learn about the exchange and are supportive of the status quo as they accept Nanako's hopelessness as a female. She is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Mai Takahashi in the live action film. ; :Sebongi is Akira Uehara's childhood friend. He falls for Akira, in Nanako's body, and wholly accepts the body exchange. Shinnosuke uses his wits in order to make Akira acknowledge his growing attraction towards him. He is voiced by Kōsuke Toriumi in the three radio drama and is portrayed by Taigo Fujisawa in the live action film. ; :Makoto is a good matured girl who is Nanako Momoi's friend.

Reception Tokyopop's localized volumes appeared on ICv2's monthly top three-hundred selling graphic novels. About.com readers ranked the series third as Best New Shojo Manga in 2008 and was ranked in the 10 Bizarre Shojo Manga Love Stories in 2010. Jason Thompson praised the series for being smart, funny, and unpredictable. Pop Culture Shock.com agreed on the humor, and described the series as something all Shōjo fans will enjoy. Mania.com described the first volume as an enjoyable read, praised it for the humor and its interesting and realistic approach to the gender swap topic, but expressed annoyance with the protagonist's behavior. Meanwhile, IGN panned the plot for being preposterous, citing the protagonists' personalities to be too extreme, and gave no incentive to move past the first volume.

FringeWare, an early attempt at ecommerce and online community, published a popular \\"magalog\\" called FringeWare Review, and a literary zine edited by Lebkowsky called Unshaved Truths. FringeWare's email list, called the FringeWare News Network, established an international following for the organization, which also opened a store in Austin, Texas. Along with Nancy White, he co-hosts the ongoing Virtual Communities Conference, the Blog Conference, and the public Inkwell Conference at the seminal online community, the WELL. His weblog can be reached at Weblogsky.com. He lives in Austin, Texas. Internet Advocacy Lebkowsky has a history of advocacy in support of a free and open Internet, and was a co-founder of EFF-Austin, an organization formed to be a chapter of the national Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). EFF-Austin became a separate organization with Lebkowsky as President. Lebkowsky coined the phrase Freedom to Connect, which became the name of an annual conference organized by David Isenberg, as an alternative to the term \\"network neutrality.\\" Early history Lebkowsky joined the WELL in 1990, and became a host or co-host of several forums on the conferencing system, including forums devoted to Factsheet Five, where he had a brief stint as book review editor, and Mondo 2000, where he wrote several articles and formed friendships with editors RU Sirius and Jude Milhon. Through the WELL, he also became associated with Howard Rheingold and Whole Earth Review, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and boing boing, where he was Associate Editor. He had early associations with staff at Wired Magazine and conducted a regular, weekly series of chats called Electronic Frontiers Forum at HotWired. He was a subdomain editor for the Millennium Whole Earth Catalog and, in 1996, became a community host at Howard Rheingold's Electric Minds. He has been interviewed about his pioneering work for the documentary Traceroute. Whole Foods Market In 1997, he joined Whole Foods Market as its \\"Internet guy,\\" to evangelize internally for the Internet and help lead their web-based ecommerce efforts, which ended in 2000 with the collapse of the so-called \\"Internet bubble.\\" As Internet evangelist within the company, he advocated creation of online community at Whole Foods Market, and was Interactive Community Director for the ecommerce site that launched in 1998. When WholeFoods.com was replaced by the ambitious Whole People, Lebkowsky moved to Colorado and helped manage technology for the new enterprise until the company ended the project following the \\"dotcom bust.\\" Web Development, Social Software, and Blogs Lebkowsky turned to web development, and formed Polycot Consulting with Jeff Kramer and Matt Sanders on September 12, 2001. He became an advocate of Open Source systems based on PHP, and later Ruby on Rails. He was an early influential social software advocate and one of the instigators of the Social Software Alliance. He was also an early blogger at Weblogsky. With Clay Shirky, he created You're It, a blog about tags and folksonomy. He also blogged at, and managed technology for, Worldchanging, an influential website focused on the future of sustainability that was inspired by the Viridian Design Movement. Bruce Sterling, Viridian Design, and the State of the World He is a close friend of author Bruce Sterling, whom he has interviewed many times, and he created and operated the web site for Sterling's Viridian Design Movement. Lebkowsky and Sterling have a world-readable \\"State of the World\\" conversation for two weeks every January on The WELL. Writing Lebkowsky has written articles and essays, and is a contributing writer and columnist at Worldchanging: A User's Guide for the 21st Century, and one of the contributors to the book Worldchanging (book). He was co-editor (with Mitch Ratcliffe) of the book Extreme Democracy Plutopia In the early 2000s, Lebkowsky was a member of the board of the Central Texas Digital Convergence Initiative (http://dcitexas.org/). In 2005, with other members of the Digital Convergence Initiative, he worked on an installation intended for the then newly established South by Southwest Interactive trade show, which was referred to in planning stages as Futurama. Due to a lack of time and funds, the installation did not occur as planned, however from planning conversations, Lebkowsky had the idea for a think tank that produces events instead of white papers. With futurist Derek Woodgate and consultant David Demaris, he put this idea into practice, creating an installation called the DIY House of the Future for Maker Faire Austin in 2007. The installation was successful. In a debriefing about the installation, a small group discussed the idea of doing more events focused on a future where everyone's home and experience could be self-configured. Lebkowsky tossed out the idea of \\"pluralist utopias,\\" which led to adoption of the portmanteau \\"Plutopia.\\" Lebkowsky and Woodgate, partnering with Maggie Duval and Bon Davis, created an event company, Plutopia Productions. Plutopia produced four large events during SXSW Interactive in Austin, in 2008 at Scholz Garten, 2009 at Palmer Events Center, and 2010-2011 at the Mexican American Cultural Center. Aligned with the 2011 event, Lebkowsky and producer Scoop Sweeney created a podcast called the Plutopia News Network. Lebkowsky left Plutopia Productions, which later closed down. However in 2018 Lebkowsky and Sweeney revived the Plutopia News Network podcast. https://plutopia.io  Other Projects He also led Austin's Wireless Future project for the IC² Institute in 2003–2004, and was a prominent figure within the Central Texas Digital Convergence Initiative, Bootstrap Austin, ATX Equation, and other local economic development projects.

Early life She was born Esther Frances Alexander in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father was the portrait painter Francis Alexander and her mother Lucia Grey Alexander (née Swett) was a philanthropist from a wealthy Massachusetts family. When she was 16, the family moved to Florence, Italy.  Career  Illustrations by Francesca Alexander In Italy, Alexander's early artistic output was as part of her mother's charity work and she wrote about and drew portraits of poor Tuscan farmers as gifts for wealthy American donors to their cause. In the process, she became familiar with local folkways and customs, collecting songs and stories and translating them for publication. In 1882 she was introduced to the English critic John Ruskin by a family friend. He was interested in her work, especially her simple, spiritual illustrations, and purchased two manuscripts from her for £600. The first was published in 1883 as The Story of Ida with its author listed simply as \\"Francesca.\\" The volume went into several editions in both the United States and Great Britain. Ruskin published her most celebrated work, Roadside Songs, in 1885. The book drew from the work of a celebrated story-teller, Beatrice Bernardi of Pian degli Ontani. It also contained a translation of a 17th-century ottava rima ballad with Italian original opposite the translated English stanzas. A third collection, Christ's Folk in the Apennines, was published in 1887-89. After Ruskin's death Alexander published Tuscan Songs (1897) and The Hidden Servants and Other Very Old Stories Told Over (1900). Alexander was blind and in poor health in her final years, and died in Florence on January 21, 1917. She is buried in the Cimiterio degli Allori.  Selected illustrations  File:Brooklyn Museum - S.

This convent is best known for having been the home of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz for over twenty five years, she produced many of her writings here. After the convent was closed in the 19th century, the large complex was divided and was home to a number of institutions and businesses, including a large dance hall in the mid 20th century. In the 1970s, the government expropriated the complex, explored it and began the restoration process. In 1979, the current university was founded at this site and it is currently the benefactor and guardian of the complex. The institution offers bachelors, two masters and two certificates, mostly in the humanities. The institution also sponsors or co- sponsors a number of cultural and educational activities, mostly situated in the historic center of the city. The cloister complex Universidad del Claustro de Sor JuanaThe cloister was founded in 1585 by Isabel de Barrios, the daughter of conquistador Andrés de Barrios. The convent was formed by the joining of two private residences, that is Alonso Ortiz (now at the extreme northeast of the Grand Claustro) and of Isabel de Barrios (at the extreme north east of the Patio de la Fundación). The two were joined then amplified by Isabel de Guevara. The complex became the home of four nuns from the Covent of La Concepción with authorization granted by archbishop Pedro Moya de Contreras as the first convents of nuns of the Saint Jerome order. The church was built in Renaissance style with Herrerian influence and consecrated in 1623. Its columns and pilasters are Doric and bear pyramidal crests. The tower dates from 1665, but despite being built during the Baroque period, the tower is unadorned. Its circular dome rests on pendentives, of a design invented by Alonos Perez de Castaneda for the Jesus Maria Church. The sculpture of Saint Hieronymite on the second body is the second oldest stone sculpture of the colonial period. The convent here was originally named for Saint Paula. Over the years, the convent underwent many changes as the number of cells (bedrooms) increased, along with corresponding services such as servants’ quarters, a living room and expanded kitchen, until it reached the dimensions it has now. This convent is best known for having been the home of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz for over 27 years. The tombstone that supposedly covers here grave in the lower choir is more of a tribute than a real grave. The nun, called the “Tenth Muse” in Mexico, wrote most of her works here. Statue of Sor Juana at the university In 1867, due to the Reform Laws, the convent was closed. The building was converted into a camp and military hospital. After that, the main patio was put to various uses such as the site of the Literary Society of Nezahualcoyotl. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was used as payment to architect Antonio Rivas Mercado, with his daughters Antonieta and Alicia inheriting it in 1927. The church became property of the state and was declared a national monument. The rest of the property was divided among several owners with some of the complex having office buildings constructed on it. The best known business to be on this site was the Smyrna Dancing Club, which operated in the mid 20th century. In 1975, a group dedicated to the studies of Sor Juana petition President Luis Echeverría to expropriate the building in order to conserve it. Under presidential decree, the complex was excavated and explored between 1976 and 1982, involving anthropologists, archeologists, architects, historians and others with the purpose of restoration. Many of the finds are objects related to the daily lives of the nuns that used to live here such as tiles, fountains, drainage systems and water collectors as well as tombs. Today the university is in charge of the complex's conservation. It is considered a “Patrimonio de la Nación” (National Heritage Site) and is featured on the back of a 200 peso bill. In the mid 2000s, the Catholic Church tried to reclaim the Church of San Jeronimo to return it to worship. However, the school resisted these efforts and eventually won in court. The university maintains the rights to the entire property as long as it remains an educational and cultural institution. The educational institution The courtyard of the Gran Claustro The Universidad del Claustro de Sor Juana was founded here in 1979, offering its first bachelors in “Human Sciences” (Ciencias Humanas) . Today, the institution offers eight in Art, Audiovisual Communication, Study and Promotion of Culture, Philosophy, Gastronomy, Humanities, Creative Writing and Literature, and Psychology. It offers master's degrees in Mexico Colonial Culture and Food and Beverage Business Administration and certificates in Food and Beverage Business Administration and Theatrical Production. Approximately 75 to 80% of graduates find work in the fields they study. The most successful of these programs is gastronomy The life and work of Sor Juana forms the intellectual basis and the identity of the institution. The building's interior has been remodeled as a mix of colonial and modern constructions, with conservation efforts being continuous. The campus expanded in 2003, with the addition of nearby Regina campus, which was part of the colonial convent of the nuns of Regina Coeli. This campus contains Neoclassical constructions done by Manuel Tolsá for the Marquesa of Selva Nevada. The library of the institution contains the Centro de Documentación Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, which aims to become the most important repository of writings about the nun and her life. Many of the works here are from the beginning of the 20th century. The Center contains both books and periodicals about both the woman and her writings. The general library collection contains a large number of first editions, most of which were donated. Patio area In 2007, the Pier Paolo Pasolina Peace Center was inaugurated which “intends to reunite the individual memory with the collective one to find paths to peace.” The piano in the upper choir of the former church Many spaces in the complex are suited to showcase exhibitions of art and culture. The University houses the Museo de la Indumentaria Mexicana \\"Luis Márquez Romay\\" (The Luis Márquez Romay Museum of Mexican Attire) . It displays an important collection of traditional Mexican attires, many of which were donated by Carmen Romano, who was First Lady of Mexico from 1976 to 1982. The Museum also hosts temporary exhibits such as the art exhibit “Ocho conjuros para sanar el alma” (Eight spells to heal the soul) as part of the 25th annual Festival de Mexico in the historic center of Mexico City. In 2007, there was an exhibition called “Monjas coronadas” (Crowned Nuns) which displayed artifacts related to the ritual of “marrying God” when nuns take their vows. It included the crowns which were placed on the nun's head, some quite large, during the colonial period. Concerts and art exhibits are showcased in the Former Church of San Jerónimo as well. One of these exhibits was that of a large touring sculpture called “Traición” (Betrayal) . The school also has a collection of musical instruments including four antique pianos, donated and currently used for concerts. San Jeronimo Street, which runs in front of the main facade, is pedestrian only and is now considered to be a plaza. It is being remodeled to house a “cultural corridor” as part of the university's outreach program to the community that will extend to the College of Vizcainas. The school as a number of other outreach programs, such as literacy education to the estimated 10,000 people in the city center who cannot read or write at a sufficient level. There are also free psychological counseling programs for domestic violence and drug addiction as well. The university says these actions are part of its efforts to support the revitalization of the historic center According to a survey called “Las Mejores Universidades 2009” (The Best Universities 2009) sponsored by the newspaper Reforma, students at Sor Juana are the largest and pickiest coffee drinkers in Mexico City. One reason for this is that the campus, located in the historic center, is surrounded by a number of gourmet cafes, which attract customers by offering cultural events such as films and poetry readings. Each year University students construct a monumental “ofrenda” or altar to the dead for Day of the Dead festivities in late October and early November. It is created with the collaboration of ex-students, teachers, artists and neighbors in the historic center of Mexico City. In 2007, the theme of the altar was “Sor Juana and time.” It included an hourglass in the center and two thousand meters of cempasúchil garlands. A secondary altar in the Zapotec style was erected in honor of Frida Kahlo. Each year, the monumental altar receives more visits by the public and more neighbors are willing to participate according to the school's dean. This tradition has been annually recreated for over two decades. The Chorus of the Universidad del Claustro de Sor Juana has performed under guest directors such as Rita Guerrero. The chorus specializes in works that are no longer frequently performed, such as the Libre Vermell de Montserrat and El Canto de la Siliba. It is made up of students from various majors and was formed in 2005. A number of the university's activities are held in partnership with other academic and cultural institutions. The university has a partnership program with UNAM for activities related to teaching, research, community outreach and culture, especially with regards to technical and technological issues. It will allow students of both institutions to attend classes in both places and the two will sponsor a number of joint academic events. Along with the Fundación del Centro Histórico (Historic Center Foundation), the University has published a guide to restaurants, taco stands, cantinas and other eateries located in the oldest neighborhoods of Mexico City. The guide is called “Guia para Comer Bien en el Centro Historico” (Guide to Eating Well in the Historic Center). The school is involved with the organization with sponsors the annual “Festival de México” in the historic center to hold conferences and a contest related to the history of cooking in Mexico called Concursos Historias y Sabores de México and Menú de Bicentenario. The objective is to recognize and conserves Mexican gastronomic traditions through research in preparation of the Bicentennial of Mexico's independence in 2010. Participants not only must prepare a representative dish, but also document the dish's history and significance. Another aspect of this event is to work with restaurants in the historic center to prepare special menus for the 2010 Festival de México. The festival ticket would include one dinner from one of these menus Outside of Mexico City, the university organized a “poetry slam” event as part of the 23rd Feria Internacional de Libro in Guadalajara in 2009. The participants performed original works which were then rated by a panel of poets and rappers. The event was titled “A ritmo de poesía” (To the beat of poetry). The reason the school sponsored the event was to show that poetry is available to all.

The Charpy impact test, also known as the Charpy V-notch test, is a standardized high strain-rate test which determines the amount of energy absorbed by a material during fracture. Absorbed energy is a measure of the material's notch toughness. It is widely used in industry, since it is easy to prepare and conduct and results can be obtained quickly and cheaply. A disadvantage is that some results are only comparative. The test was pivotal in understanding the fracture problems of ships during World War II. The test was developed around 1900 by S. B. Russell (1898, American) and Georges Charpy (1901, French).Siewert The test became known as the Charpy test in the early 1900s due to the technical contributions and standardization efforts by Charpy. History In 1896, S. B. Russell introduced the idea of residual fracture energy and devised a pendulum fracture test. Russell's initial tests measured un-notched samples. In 1897, Frémont introduced a test to measure the same phenomenon using a spring-loaded machine. In 1901, Georges Charpy proposed a standardized method improving Russell's by introducing a redesigned pendulum and notched sample, giving precise specifications. Definition A vintage impact test machine. Yellow cage on the left is meant to prevent accidents during pendulum swing, pendulum is seen at rest at the bottom The apparatus consists of a pendulum of known mass and length that is dropped from a known height to impact a notched specimen of material. The energy transferred to the material can be inferred by comparing the difference in the height of the hammer before and after the fracture (energy absorbed by the fracture event). The notch in the sample affects the results of the impact test, thus it is necessary for the notch to be of regular dimensions and geometry. The size of the sample can also affect results, since the dimensions determine whether or not the material is in plane strain. This difference can greatly affect the conclusions made. The Standard methods for Notched Bar Impact Testing of Metallic Materials can be found in ASTM E23,ASTM E23 Standard Test Methods for Notched Bar Impact Testing of Metallic Materials ISO 148-1ISO 148-1 Metallic materials - Charpy pendulum impact test - Part 1: Test method or EN 10045-1 (retired and replaced with ISO 148-1),EN 10045-1 Charpy impact test on metallic materials. Test method (V- and U-notches) where all the aspects of the test and equipment used are described in detail. Quantitative results The quantitative result of the impact tests the energy needed to fracture a material and can be used to measure the toughness of the material. There is a connection to the yield strength but it cannot be expressed by a standard formula. Also, the strain rate may be studied and analyzed for its effect on fracture. The ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) may be derived from the temperature where the energy needed to fracture the material drastically changes. However, in practice there is no sharp transition and it is difficult to obtain a precise transition temperature (it is really a transition region). An exact DBTT may be empirically derived in many ways: a specific absorbed energy, change in aspect of fracture (such as 50% of the area is cleavage), etc. Qualitative results The qualitative results of the impact test can be used to determine the ductility of a material. If the material breaks on a flat plane, the fracture was brittle, and if the material breaks with jagged edges or shear lips, then the fracture was ductile. Usually, a material does not break in just one way or the other and thus comparing the jagged to flat surface areas of the fracture will give an estimate of the percentage of ductile and brittle fracture. Sample sizes According to ASTM A370,ASTM A370 Standard Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Testing of Steel Products the standard specimen size for Charpy impact testing is 10 mm × 10 mm × 55 mm. Subsize specimen sizes are: 10 mm × 7.5 mm × 55 mm, 10 mm × 6.7 mm × 55 mm, 10 mm × 5 mm × 55 mm, 10 mm × 3.3 mm × 55 mm, 10 mm × 2.5 mm × 55 mm. Details of specimens as per ASTM A370 (Standard Test Method and Definitions for Mechanical Testing of Steel Products). According to EN 10045-1 (retired and replaced with ISO 148), standard specimen sizes are 10 mm × 10 mm × 55 mm. Subsize specimens are: 10 mm × 7.5 mm × 55 mm and 10 mm × 5 mm × 55 mm. According to ISO 148, standard specimen sizes are 10 mm × 10 mm × 55 mm. Subsize specimens are: 10 mm × 7.5 mm × 55 mm, 10 mm × 5 mm × 55 mm and 10 mm × 2.5 mm × 55 mm. According to MPIF Standard 40, the standard unnotched specimen size is 10 mm (±0.125 mm) x 10 mm (±0.125 mm) x 55 mm (±2.5 mm). Impact test results on low- and high-strength materials The impact energy of low-strength metals that do not show a change of fracture mode with temperature, is usually high and insensitive to temperature. For these reasons, impact tests are not widely used for assessing the fracture- resistance of low-strength materials whose fracture modes remain unchanged with temperature. Impact tests typically show a ductile-brittle transition for low-strength materials that do exhibit change in fracture mode with temperature such as body-centered cubic (BCC) transition metals. Generally, high-strength materials have low impact energies which attest to the fact that fractures easily initiate and propagate in high-strength materials. The impact energies of high-strength materials other than steels or BCC transition metals are usually insensitive to temperature. High-strength BCC steels display a wider variation of impact energy than high-strength metal that do not have a BCC structure because steels undergo microscopic ductile-brittle transition. Regardless, the maximum impact energy of high-strength steels is still low due to their brittleness.

History  Eddy current testing (ECT) as a technique for testing finds its roots in electromagnetism. Eddy currents were first observed by François Arago in 1824, but French physicist Léon Foucault is credited with discovering them in 1855. ECT began largely as a result of the English scientist Michael Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831. Faraday discovered that when there is a closed path through which current can circulate and a time-varying magnetic field passes through a conductor (or vice versa), an electric current flows through this conductor. In 1879, another English-born scientist, David Edward Hughes, demonstrated how the properties of a coil change when placed in contact with metals of different conductivity and permeability, which was applied to metallurgical sorting tests.Ivor Hughes. \\"The AWA Review: Professor David Edward Hughes\\", 2009, retrieved July 1, 2015 Much of the development of ECT as a nondestructive testing technique for industrial applications was carried out during World War II in Germany. Professor Friedrich Förster while working for the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute (now the Kaiser Wilhelm Society) adapted eddy current technology to industrial use, developing instruments measuring conductivity and sorting mixed ferrous components. After the war, in 1948, Förster founded a company, now called the Foerster Group where he made great strides in developing practical ECT instruments and marketing them.Nikhil Jahain. \\"The Rebirth of Eddy Current Testing\\", 2014, retrieved July 1, 2015 Eddy current testing is now a widely used and well understood inspection technique for flaw detection, as well as thickness and conductivity measurements. Frost & Sullivan analysis in the global NDT equipment market in 2012 estimated the magnetic and electromagnetic NDT equipment market at $220 million, which includes conventional eddy current, magnetic particle inspection, eddy current array, and remote-field testing. This market is projected to grow at 7.5% compounded annual growth rate to approximately $315 million by 2016.  ECT principle  Visualization of Eddy Currents Inductionhttps://www.suragus.com/en/technology/eddy-current/ In its most basic form — the single-element ECT probe — a coil of conductive wire is excited with an alternating electrical current. This wire coil produces an alternating magnetic field around itself. The magnetic field oscillates at the same frequency as the current running through the coil. When the coil approaches a conductive material, currents opposite to the ones in the coil are induced in the material — eddy currents. Variations in the electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability of the test object, and the presence of defects causes a change in eddy current and a corresponding change in phase and amplitude that can be detected by measuring the impedance changes in the coil, which is a telltale sign of the presence of defects.Joseph M. Buckley. \\"An Introduction to Eddy Current Testing Theory and Technology\\", retrieved July 1, 2015 This is the basis of standard (pancake coil) ECT. NDT kits can be used in the eddy current testing process. ECT has a very wide range of applications. Since ECT is electrical in nature, it is limited to conductive material. There are also physical limits to generating eddy currents and depth of penetration (skin depth).Terry Hennigar and Mike Wright. \\"Eddy Current Testing Technology\\", 1st edition, 2012  Applications The two major applications of eddy current testing are surface inspection and tubing inspections. Surface inspection is used extensively in the aerospace industry, but also in the petrochemical industry. The technique is very sensitive and can detect tight cracks. Surface inspection can be performed both on ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic materials. Tubing inspection is generally limited to non-ferromagnetic tubing and is known as conventional eddy current testing. Conventional ECT is used for inspecting steam generator tubing in nuclear plants and heat exchangers tubing in power and petrochemical industries. The technique is very sensitive to detect and size pits. Wall loss or corrosion can be detected but sizing is not accurate. A variation of conventional ECT for partially magnetic materials is full saturation ECT. In this technique, permeability variations are suppressed by applying a magnetic field. The saturation probes contain conventional eddy current coils and magnets. This inspection is used on partially ferromagnetic materials such as nickel alloys, duplex alloys, and thin-ferromagnetic materials such as ferritic chromium molybdenum stainless steel. The application of a saturation eddy current technique depends on the permeability of the material, tube thickness, and diameter.H M Sadek. \\"NDE technologies for the examination of heat exchangers and boiler tubes – principles, advantages and limitations\\", Insight vol. 48 no. 3, March 2006, retrieved July 1, 2015 A method used for carbon steel tubing is remote field eddy current testing. This method is sensitive to general wall loss and not sensitive to small pits and cracks. = ECT on surfaces = When it comes to surface applications, the performance of any given inspection technique depends greatly on the specific conditions — mostly the types of materials and defects, but also surface conditions, etc. However, in most situations, the following are true: * Effective on coatings/paint: yes * Computerized record keeping: partial * 3D/Advanced imaging: none * User dependence: high * Speed: low * Post-inspection analysis: none * Requires chemicals/consumables: no = Other applications = ECT is also useful in making electrical conductivity and coating thickness measurements, among others.  Other eddy current testing techniques  To circumvent some of the shortcomings of conventional ECT, other eddy current testing techniques were developed with various successes. = Eddy current array = Eddy current array (ECA) and conventional ECT share the same basic working principles. ECA technology provides the ability to electronically drive an array of coils ( multiple coils) arranged in specific pattern called a topology that generates a sensitivity profile suited to the target defects. Data acquisition is achieved by multiplexing the coils in a special pattern to avoid mutual inductance between the individual coils. The benefits of ECA are:Eddy Current Array, retrieved July 2, 2015 * Faster inspections * Wider coverage * Less operator dependence — array probes yield more consistent results compared to manual raster scans * Better detection capabilities * Easier analysis because of simpler scan patterns * Improved positioning and sizing because of encoded data * Array probes can easily be designed to be flexible or shaped to specifications, making hard-to-reach areas easier to inspect ECA technology provides a remarkably powerful tool and saves significant time during inspections.Eddy Current Array (ECA) Theory, Practice and Application, retrieved July 2, 2015 ECA inspection in carbon steel welds is regulated by ASTM standard E3052. = Lorentz force eddy current testing = A different, albeit physically closely related challenge is the detection of deeply lying flaws and inhomogeneities in electrically conducting solid materials. Fig. 1 : LET working principle. Adapted from M. Zec et al., Fast Technique for Lorentz Force Calculations in Nondestructive Testing Applications, COMPUMAG 2013, Budapest, Hungary In the traditional version of eddy current testing an alternating (AC) magnetic field is used to induce eddy currents inside the material to be investigated. If the material contains a crack or flaw which make the spatial distribution of the electrical conductivity nonuniform, the path of the eddy currents is perturbed and the impedance of the coil which generates the AC magnetic field is modified. By measuring the impedance of this coil, a crack can hence be detected. Since the eddy currents are generated by an AC magnetic field, their penetration into the subsurface region of the material is limited by the skin effect. The applicability of the traditional version of eddy current testing is therefore limited to the analysis of the immediate vicinity of the surface of a material, usually of the order of one millimeter. Attempts to overcome this fundamental limitation using low frequency coils and superconducting magnetic field sensors have not led to widespread applications. A recent technique, referred to as Lorentz force eddy current testing (LET),Uhlig, R. P., Zec, M., Brauer, H. and Thess, A. 2012 \\"Lorentz Force Eddy Current Testing:a Prototype Model\\". Journal of Nondestructive Evaluation, 31, 357–372 exploits the advantages of applying DC magnetic fields and relative motion providing deep and relatively fast testing of electrically conducting materials. In principle, LET represents a modification of the traditional eddy current testing from which it differs in two aspects, namely (i) how eddy currents are induced and (ii) how their perturbation is detected. In LET eddy currents are generated by providing the relative motion between the conductor under test and a permanent magnet(see figure). If the magnet is passing by a defect, the Lorentz force acting on it shows a distortion whose detection is the key for the LET working principle. If the object is free of defects, the resulting Lorentz force remains constant.

He is recognized as developing the basics of video circuitry principles that were used for Computer Space and later Pong, one of the first and most successful arcade games. Education and early career Dabney was born in San Francisco, California to Irma and Samuel Frederick Dabney. His parents divorced while he was young and subsequently raised by his father. One of several schools that he attended was John A. O'Connell High School of Technology, where he studied trade drafting, which led to him getting a job with the California Department of Transportation while still a teenager. He eventually got his high school diploma from San Mateo High School; Dabney credited a math teacher named Walker there that got him interested in the electronics and computing areas. He then had a summer position with a local surveyor company, but when the work dried up by the winter, he was let go, and he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. Within his three years of the Corps he took courses on electronics, giving him an interest in the area. He was able to leave the Corps as he had been admitted into San Francisco State University, but as he did not have the funds to support his education, he instead took a job with Bank of America based on his electronics experience, where he kept the Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting operational. Career in the computer industry The Computer Space arcade game cabinet Dabney left Bank of America after a year, and on recommendation of John Herbert, a colleague he worked with, was hired by Hewlett-Packard. Within a few weeks, Herbert had moved on to Ampex and convinced Dabney to interview there. Dabney joined Ampex in 1961, working in their military products section. This work led to him becoming involved in early video imagery products within Ampex, including vidicon systems. By around 1969 Ampex had also hired Nolan Bushnell, who worked alongside Dabney and where they became friends. Bushnell, prior to joining Ampex, had come up with the idea of making a carnival-like pizza place with animatronics and games, and discussed this idea with Dabney. After seeing a computer system at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the two came up with the concept of using a smaller computer or video systems, adding coin slots, and allowing people to pay to play games on this. Dabney and Bushnell jointly created a partnership called Syzygy (named after astronomy term representing an alignment of celestial bodies) in 1971. When they decided to incorporate, they discovered another company had that name and therefore established their corporation under the name Atari, Inc., based on the Go term equivalent to chess's \\"check\\", as both had been avid fans of the game. Their first product was Computer Space, inspired by having seen Spacewar! running at various computer laboratories. Dabney created a motion system using a video circuit made up of cheap analog and digital components of a standard television set rather than acquire an expensive computer, while Bushnell designed its cabinet and worked with Nutting Associates to manufacture the game at scale. Bushnell used this to convince Al Alcorn, another Ampex employee, to leave and join Atari to help program more of these games. Under Bushnell's direction, Alcorn used Dabney's video circuit concept to create the programming for Atari's next game, Pong. Dabney constructed the coin slot mechanism portion of the cabinet. Once their one-off version proved successful, they ramped up production for scale, with Dabney overseeing the manufacturing process. Pong became the first successful arcade game. As Pong became successful, Dabney felt overshadowed by both Bushnell and Alcorn. He learned that Bushnell had patented his video circuit idea without including Dabney on the patent. Bushnell also had assigned Dabney a lower-level position in Atari and did not include him in high-level meetings. Around March 1973, Dabney left the company over this falling out, selling his portion of the company's ownership for . Dabney did continue to help Bushnell with starting his Pizza Time Theater (the predecessor of Chuck E. Cheese's) and Catalyst Technologies as an employee, being wary of Bushnell's previous treatment of him. Alongside these, he worked for several companies, including Raytheon and Fujitsu, and at other times working on his own projects for his own video game company Syzygy Game Company, where he made games that Bushnell used for his Pizza Time Theaters, including an arcade quiz game based on science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. Dabney also helped with the automated ticket number system used by the restaurants. When Pizza Time Theater went under, and Bushnell could not pay Dabney what he owed him, Dabney opted to close down Syzygy, and ended his friendship with Bushnell. Dabney went to work at Teledyne for about ten years before deciding to leave the industry. Later life and death Dabney had married, and later divorced, Joan Wahrmund, with whom he had two daughters. He later married Carolyn Dabney. After leaving the computer industry, Dabney and Carolyn managed a grocery store and later a deli in Crescent Mills, California. Around 2006, they moved from California to a property he owned near Okanogan National Forest in Washington. The Dabneys later returned to California, taking up residence in Clearlake, a city north of San Francisco. Their house was completely destroyed in the Clayton Fire in August 2016. A GoFundMe account was set up to help the Dabneys resettle, but it was cancelled after Dabney confirmed that he didn't need it. After his departure from Atari, Dabney did not receive much publicity, and until 2009, his contributions towards Atari and the early days of video games were generally forgotten. Dabney reappeared in 2009, following an announcement made by Paramount Pictures the previous year that they were going to make a biographical film based on Nolan Bushnell, but had never approached Dabney for any input. Dabney gave an interview with video game historian Leonard Herman in Edge that described his contributions towards Atari, and acknowledged that \\"I'm sure [Bushnell] had no desire to even acknowledge that I ever existed\\" and \\"He wouldn't give me any credit even while I was still there\\". Dabney was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in late 2017, and opted against treatment. He died on May 26, 2018 in his Clearlake home from complications from the cancer.

In 2005 they were jailed for civil contempt of court after refusing to obey a temporary court injunction forbidding them to interfere with work being undertaken by Shell on their land. History Justice Finnegan, President of the High Court of the Republic of Ireland, jailed the five on 29 June 2005 for civil contempt of court after refusing to obey a temporary court injunction forbidding them to interfere with work being undertaken by Shell on their land. The committal order was sought by Shell who intended to build a high pressure raw gas pipeline across land in Rossport to pipe gas from the offshore Corrib Gas Field. Three of the five men own land in Rossport: Vincent McGrath and Ó Seighin were brought to court along with them as they had assisted in blocking the Shell workers. About thirty others who had done the same were not charged.

The protests were driven by the Shell to Sea campaign (then TD Jerry Cowley liaised with the men in prison) which took its name following a meeting with Burren campaigners in January 2005 Shell to Sea. Defending his company's stance, Shell Ireland's CEO Andy Pyle said: \\"The fact is that we've gone through a process, and we have five people who don't like the outcome.\\" All Shell sites around Rossport and Bellinaboy were blockaded by the men's neighbours, preventing work.\\"Shell gets it badly wrong in the 'arse end of nowhere'\\", Sunday Tribune, 31 July 2005.\\"The battle of the bog\\", The Herald (Glasgow), 8 August 2005.

In an unusual move by the Irish judiciary, the men were told that a judge would be on hand at any time of day or night if they wanted to purge their contempt, by promising they would no longer hinder Shell employees. The men were released from Cloverhill Prison on 30 September 2005, after 94 days, when Shell applied to the High Court to have the injunction lifted. This came after intense media and political scrutiny of the case.\\"Cowley expelled during Rossport row\\", RTÉ Online, 28 September 2005.

In December 2006,an account of events leading up their imprisonment was published by the Rossport Five. There was a second printing of the book (Our Story,The Rossport 5)in January 2007.

The story revolves around an ex-nun who gets mixed up in pornography, violence and international crime but ends up intact in the convent she left. Plot Still a virgin after 15 years in a convent, the demure Isabelle earns her living in New York by writing pornography, which she researches by buying magazines and hiring videos. In a café she befriends Thomas, who has amnesia after falling from a window. In another café, an accountant called Edward is befriended by Sofia, who pushed Thomas out of the window because, she says, he introduced her to drugs at the age of 12 and made her into a celebrated porn actress. She now wants revenge on Jacques, a crooked businessman for whom both Thomas and Edward worked. Learning from Edward that Thomas has data on disk that could destroy Jacques, she steals Jacques' phone number from Edward's address book while he is in the restroom. Upon returning, Edward gives her the address of a house upstate where she can hide. After contacting Jacques to blackmail him, she meets Edward at Grand Central Terminal, where he mentions that Sofia should not talk about the disks with anyone, since Jacques kills anyone who knows about them. Having agreed to meet one of Jacques' men at Grand Central to give him the address to her apartment where the disks are, Sofia urges Edward to come with her to the house upstate, afraid both she and Edward will end up being killed. She then leaves the station only to see Jacques' hit men shoving Edward into a car. They take him to an abandoned building to torture him and leave him for dead. Meanwhile, in a hired video Thomas sees Sofia in action and his memory starts returning. With Isabelle he retraces his steps and finds the flat where he and Sofia lived. Isabelle dresses in one of Sofia's sexy outfits and is on the point of losing her virginity to him when someone enters and the two hastily hide. It is Jacques' hit men looking for Sofia, who arrives shortly thereafter only to be tied up by the hit men who begin to torture her. Bursting out, Thomas and Isabelle throw one hit man out of the window and, freeing Sofia, make off with her in the other hit man's car. Sofia suggests they head for the empty country cottage Edward had told her about. On the way Isabelle posts the disks to her publisher, asking him to expose the evil of Jacques after having viewed the files while at the apartment. When the surviving hit man traces them to the cottage, he wounds Sofia before being shot dead by Edward who arrives in a stolen car. The four make off before the police arrive and Isabelle directs them to her former convent, where they are given sanctuary and the dying Sofia is tended. But the convent is surrounded by armed police, who want Edward for murder. Thomas, his conscience awakened by the kindness and care Isabelle has shown, by the realisation of his criminal past, and by guilt over the fate of Sofia, walks out of the front gate and is killed instantly by a police marksman.

Among the group's leaders were Antonio ('Toni') Negri, Nanni Balestrini, Franco Piperno, Oreste Scalzone and Valerio Morucci, who led its clandestine armed wing.

It sought to base its Marxist theory on the everyday life of supposedly revolutionary factory workers. Potere Operaio officially ceased to exist on 3 June 1973. Most of its core members went on to be involved in Autonomia Operaia, signalling the shift from operaismo to autonomism. Some of the leaders later drifted towards more radical groups such as the Red Brigades, including Morucci and Adriana Faranda, who took part in the Moro murder. Negri was arrested in the late 1970s, accused of being the leader of the Red Brigades, before being cleared of charges. Oreste Scalzone also was arrested, in connection with violent acts.

In addition to publishing games and utilities under the Interceptor label the company ran a tape and later disc duplication business, a print shop and associated graphic design studio, manufactured dual size cassette tape cases under the Compact Case Company brand and published budget software under the Players and Players Premier labels, and a few full-price titles under the premium Pandora label. The company was owned and operated by father and son team Julian and Richard Jones, out of various locations in and around the small town of Tadley, near Basingstoke in Hampshire, England. At the height of its success the company employed around thirty people, but fell victim to the 90's video game decline, and went out of business in the early nineties.  Early days  Richard and Julian's first foray into the computer games business is documented on the official Llamasoft web site with The Joneses and Jeff Minter forming a partnership in 1982. Although the Llamasoft account of the parties' short relationship and the events surrounding the dissolution of the partnership reflect Jeff Minter and his family's opinions, the key facts and dates do not seem to be in dispute. The Jones' and Minters' short-lived partnership ended in September 1982.http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi- bin/displaypage.pl?issue=001&page;=010&magazine;=pcg History has shown that neither parties' interest in the business suffered from the split, with Jeff retaining the Llamasoft name and the Joneses forming Interceptor.

The Players Premier label games were priced at . In addition some titles were released for the Atari ST and Amiga platforms on disc at under the Smash 16 and Players Gold labels. The titles competed against budget software pioneer Mastertronic, and later Codemasters and others in an increasingly crowded budget software marketplace. Players packaging was bright and colourful. The original concept was designed by Michael Wood, an artist and designer and the then Studio Manager at Interceptor. Most of the packaging artwork at the time was designed by Michael Wood who had several artists working with him. The designs were worked up as finished pieces by air brush artists such as Peter Austin. The label's most successful and best-known releases were the Joe Blade series of games (1987–1989), but Players and Players Premier released over 100 titles across various platforms.

In addition, both labels re-released various full price titles and various games and demos for magazine cover- mounted tapes, which Interceptor duplicated for various computer magazines.  The Pandora label  In 1987 Interceptor launched Pandora, a new premium- priced label. Pandora released several games for 8- and 16-bit computers. Its first and most successful title was Into the Eagle's Nest, a Gauntlet style burst-scroller set in a Nazi occupied castle.http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi- bin/displaypage.pl?issue=025&page;=026&magazine;=zzap Other titles included Galdregon's Domain (1988),http://www.lemonamiga.com/?game_id=1264 Xenomorph (1990), Outlands (1989) and Debut (1990). It is believed Debut (a complex planet simulator coupled with a side-scroller action element) was one of the last titles to be published under the Pandora label, in December 1990.  The Fun Factory label  In 1991 and 1992, during the waning days of the company several Atari ST and Amiga titles were released under the Fun Factory Brand.

Due to his youth, ambition and love of fast cars he often appeared on local television and in the papers during the early years. However, Julian was the company mainstay, working long hours, often on the factory floor, building the company. Interceptor worked with various programmers, artists, and musicians over the years, relying mostly on freelance talent but also employing a number of up and coming in-house coders. Foremost amongst the in-house programmers were Andrew Challishttp://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games//list.php%3Fcoder%3DAndrew+Challis and Kevin Parker. Apart from developing original titles and porting existing games to other platforms they also developed custom \\"loaders\\" and produced the tape masters for the duplication of Interceptor and other companies titles. Interceptor pioneered \\"loada-games\\" across multiple platforms, not just the C64 (see the Spectrum version of Joe Blade 2). These were a series of mini games that you could play while the main game continued to load from tape. This was clever stuff, but occasionally resulted in customers returning product mistaking the loada-game for the advertised content. Other in-house developers included Andrew Severn (last spotted as producer of Gun for Nethersoft), Martin (Jabba) Severn (last spotted working for Pumpkin Studios), Gary Biasillo,http://www.c64.com/gt_display_interview.php?interview=19 Steve Briggs,https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevebriggsinfo Chris Johnson (who later worked for SEGA in San Francisco and as a Lead Producer at Zynga), Mike Brown, Paul Griffiths, Robin Chapman and Colin Swinbourne (last spotted at Nice Tech). Brian Leake and Mark Davidson, who briefly worked on-site during the development of Debut, followed their careers in the USA; Brian was last spotted at The Walt Disney Company in California, and Mark at Destineer in North Carolina. Prolific freelance Interceptor programmers Richard Robinson & Keith Harvey (AKA 'Howlin' Mad', also known as 'Mirai') went on to form the multimedia futurist band \\"Intelligentsia\\" in Tokyo, and Earth Academy Records in London, both working in TV Media and the progressive arts.

Kenyon (born c. 1939) is Professor Emeritus of Biology at San Francisco State University, a young Earth creationist, and one of the instigators of the intelligent design movement. He is the author of Biochemical Predestination. He became a creationist around 1976, and gave testimony defending creation science at the McLean v. Arkansas and Edwards v. Aguillard court cases. During the latter case, he co-authored the creation science supplementary textbook Of Pandas and People. The case decision went against teaching creation science in public schools, and the authors then altered all references to creationism to refer to intelligent design before the book was published in 1989. He subsequently became a Fellow of the Discovery Institute, and continued to endorse young Earth creationism. Biography = Career = Kenyon received a BSc in physics from the University of Chicago in 1961 and a Ph.D. in biophysics from Stanford University in 1965.

Edwards v. Aguillard Following the McLean ruling, which declared the teaching of \\"creation science\\" in public schools to be an unconstitutional establishment of religion, Louisiana's version of the \\"Equal Time\\" legislation was put to the test. This time, Wendell Bird was deputized by the state and ran the state's defense of the law. Dean Kenyon was advertised as the creationists' lead expert witness, however the case (which eventually became Edwards v. Aguillard when it reached the Supreme Court) was decided by summary judgment, and so never went to a full trial. Nevertheless, in written briefs and in his oral arguments, Bird relied heavily on an expert witness affidavit written by Kenyon. This affidavit is online at the TalkOrigins website. It was entered into evidence in the Kitzmiller case as evidence that Kenyon was explicitly defending \\"creation science\\"—and advocating that it be given equal time in public schools and textbooks as the \\"only\\" alternative to evolution—while at the same time working on a public school textbook, which eventually became the first \\"intelligent design\\" book, Of Pandas and People. In 1987, in Edwards v. Aguillard the Supreme Court heard a case concerning a Louisiana Law that required \\"creation science\\" be taught on an equal basis with evolution in public schools. Anti-creationists argued that this was illegal on the basis that it violated the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution. Kenyon issued an affidavit in that case, stating his support for creationism, and defining it thus: > Creation-science means origin through abrupt appearance in complex form, and > includes biological creation, biochemical creation (or chemical creation), > and cosmic creation. (...) Creation-science does not include as essential > parts the concepts of catastrophism, a world-wide flood, a recent inception > of the earth or life, from nothingness (ex nihilo), the concept of kinds, or > any concepts from Genesis or other religious texts. =Recent work= During the Edwards v. Aguillard case, Kenyon was co- authoring with Percival Davis, a creationist school textbook entitled Of Pandas and People, which was published in 1989. After the Edwards decision, all references to \\"creationism\\" were replaced with \\"intelligent design\\", with a reference to \\"creationists\\" being replaced by \\"design proponents\\". In the history of creationism, this is the origin of the term intelligent design and the link between creationism and intelligent design. In October 1992, Kenyon was told by the chair of the SFSU Biology Department to stop teaching creationism in introductory biology courses. He had been teaching creationism\\"Professor Teaching Disbelief In Evolution And Being Chastised,\\" Gadsden Times, Dec 17, 1980 and intelligent design \\"for more than ten years,\\" which received complaints from students and some faculty.\\"For more than 10 years Dean Kenyon has been teaching that an intelligent designer...\\" cited in \\"Teacher Wins Fight Over Creationism,\\" San Jose Mercury News, Jan 11, 1994 Following the Chair's request, the faculty came out in support of Kenyon's academic freedom and ability to teach what he wanted without administration controlling topics.\\"Faculty backs scientist who says life had \`intelligent design',\\" The Dallas Morning News, Jan 16, 1994 After a hearing, Kenyon \\"won the right to teach his iconoclastic view of the evolution of life.\\"\\"Creationism Causes Flap At San Francisco State,\\" Tuscaloosa News Jan 5, 1994\\"Panel Vindicates Biology Professor,\\" Buffalo News Jan 23, 1994 Kenyon claimed objections to his teaching rested on a positivist view of what constitutes legitimate science. Following the controversy, Kenyon entered talks with what became the Discovery Institute, including Stephen C. Meyer, Phillip E. Johnson, William Dembski and Michael Behe. He then became a Fellow of the Discovery Institute, which he remains today. The Institute is the driving force behind the intelligent design movement. In Winter 1996, Kenyon's co-authored paper, \\"The RNA World: A Critique,\\" appeared in Origins and Design, a now defunct creationist journal where he was on the Editorial Advisory Board. He continued publicly arguing in favor of creationism, notably at the 1998 International Conference on Creationism. Currently, Kenyon is a speaker, writer, and board member for the Kolbe Center, a Catholic YEC group. In 2008, Kenyon endorsed a young Earth creationist book promoted by the Center.Book of the Month, Kolbe Center, archived 2 June 2008 Works by Kenyon * Kenyon DH, Steinman G.

Only six of the twenty-six people on board survived. It was Britain's worst helicopter civil aviation accident at the time. An investigation was promptly carried out by the Accidents Investigation Branch (AIB), though calls for a public inquiry were dismissed. The AIB found that the accident was caused by pilot error, in failing to notice and correct an unintentional descent when attempting to fly at low altitude due to poor visibility. Other contributory factors were found to be a failure to monitor flight instruments adequately, and a lack of audio height warning equipment. The crash sparked a review of helicopter safety, and eight recommendations were made by the AIB. Of these, seven were adopted, most notably that it was mandatory for there to be audible height warnings on passenger helicopters operating off-shore. It remained the worst British civilian helicopter accident until 1986, when the Boeing 234LR Chinook helicopter G-BWFC crashed in the North Sea, with 45 fatalities. Background The Sikorsky S-61N helicopter Oscar November (G-BEON) was owned by British Airways Helicopters, configured to seat 24 passengers, and typically operated between Aberdeen and the oil platforms of the North Sea. On 24 June 1983, Oscar November was assigned to act as a replacement for the British Airways Helicopters commercial passenger service between Penzance and the Isles of Scilly. The helicopter that usually operated the service, a Sikorsky S-61NM fitted with 32 passenger seats, was out of action while it was being repaired. On 3 July 1983, Oscar November received its annual certificate of airworthiness. Manufactured in 1977, Oscar November's airframe had flown a total of 7,904 hours, 49 of which had been since the last certificate of airworthiness.AAIB 1985, p. 7. The crew consisted of pilots Captain Dominic Lawlor (37 years old) and Captain Neil Charleton (30), along with cabin attendant Robin Lander (22).AAIB 1985, p. 2. Lawlor was designated as the commander for the flight, while Charleton acted as co-pilot. Lawlor had flown a total of 3,970 pilot hours prior to the flight, of which 2,820 had been in an S-61N helicopter, and although he was based in Aberdeen, he had flown the Penzance–St Mary's route over 50 times before. Charleton was based in Beccles, but had also flown the route before, over 100 times. He had a total of 3,737 pilot hours, of which 2,280 had been in an S-61N.AAIB 1985, p. 5–6. The twenty-minute Penzance–St Mary's route was flown regularly during the summer; with 12 scheduled return flights running six days a week. Flight Penzance Heliport, from which the flight departed. Oscar November was one of two flights scheduled to fly from Penzance Heliport to St Mary's Airport on the Isles of Scilly on the morning of 16 July; the other was G-BDDA (Delta Alpha), another S-61 helicopter. Delta Alpha had been scheduled to depart at 7:50am(GMT), while Oscar November was due to leave at 8:15am, but both flights were delayed due to poor visibility. The weather forecast from the Plymouth Meteorological Office that morning warned of fog from 7:00am until 5:00pm, with visibility typically between , but as low as in fog banks. The actual visibility recorded at St Mary's Aerodrome increased from at 9:30am to by 11:30am.AAIB 1985, p. 11. Delta Alpha departed at 10:46am, and landed at St Mary's at 11:06am. With the possibility of the weather worsening, Lawlor waited for confirmation that Delta Alpha had landed and flown the entire journey according to visual flight rules (VFR). The minimum requirements to conduct a VFR flight were of visibility, with a cloud ceiling of . Having received confirmation, Oscar November departed Penzance at roughly 11:10am, with 23 passengers on board, on flight BA 5918. Oscar November climbed to a height of , and as they passed by Longships Lighthouse, about off the coast of Land's End, the visibility was recorded as being between . During the investigation into the crash, Lawlor and Charleton reported that they received a verbal weather report from the crew of Delta Alpha, who were passing on their return flight. According to the pair, they were told that visibility was at . However, the crew of Delta Alpha did not recall talking to the Oscar November crew at any time during their flight. Based on this information, which he interpreted to mean that the cloud base was at 300 feet, Lawlor descended to , to be able to analyse the situation better on their approach. For his part, Charleton had interpreted the message differently, believing that 300 feet had referred to the height at which Delta Alpha had been when they made the observations, but the pair did not discuss the report. At 11:30am, Charleton communicated with St Mary's, indicating that they were level at 500 feet, and were halfway through their crossing. They maintained good visibility with the sea below them, and although haze limited their forward visibility so that they could not see the horizon, they were confident it was in excess of the VFR minimum of 900 metres. Roughly from St Mary's, Lawlor began to descend to , the minimum height permitted, as he expected the cloud base to be at 300 feet. Both pilots confirmed with their instruments when that height had been attained, and thereafter Charleton concentrated on his radar and communicating with St Mary's. Lawlor then reduced speed, during which the vertical gyro indicator gave a brief warning of an attitude failure; however Lawlor checked the instruments, which appeared normal. Confident that the weather had improved, Lawlor stopped monitoring his instruments, and flew by visual aids only.AAIB 1985, pp. 2–3. =Crash= A Sikorsky S-61 helicopter, with the sponsons clearly visible on either side. During Oscar Novembers crash, these were broken off. At roughly 11:35am, following a string of communication between Charleton and St Mary's, the last message was sent from the aerodrome; \\"Oscar November is clear to land 300 degrees at 5 knots.\\"AAIB 1985, p. 3. When Oscar November was roughly from the coast, the helicopter crashed into the sea,AAIB 1985, p. 4. hitting the sea three successive times. Both Lawlor and Charleton thought that the plane was still at 250 feet, though one of the passengers, Lucille Langley-Williams, said that the cabin attendant had told her they were flying at around shortly before the crash. The Sikorsky S-61 was fitted with floats on either side, known as sponsons, and the base was designed to be like the hull of a boat, so that the helicopter could float. However, the heavy impact broke both sponsons off and broke the floor, letting water into the helicopter. Lacking the stability that the sponsons would provide, the fuselage rolled over, letting water in even quicker, and sank. Only six of the twenty six people on board escaped from the helicopter; Lawlor exited through the emergency exit window by his seat, while Charleton and a child got out through the forward freight bay. Another child managed to escape via the rear freight bay, and two adults exited through the starboard airstairs door.AAIB 1985, pp. 15–16. In addition to the two pilots, the survivors were Howard Goddard (aged 12), Ellen Hanslow (15), Lucille Langley-Williams and Megan Smith (both 60). Ellen spotted that Goddard was struggling in the water, and she swam to help him. None of the six had managed to retrieve a life jacket, and so the two pilots gathered the survivors together, and helped keep them afloat, using suitcases as flotation aids. The incident was the worst civilian helicopter crash in the United Kingdom since 1981, when eleven oil workers and both pilots died in the 1981 Bristow Helicopters Westland Wessex crash. =Rescue= Roughly ten minutes after the last communication between Oscar November and air traffic control at St Mary's, a request was made by air traffic control that the St Mary's lifeboat be launched. Shortly thereafter, they also contacted RNAS Culdrose that Oscar November was overdue, and requested that the search and rescue helicopters be put on stand-by. The lifeboat, RNLB Robert Edgar, launched around midday, around the same time as the search and rescue helicopter was scrambled from Culdrose. The Navy's Westland Wessex helicopter arrived at the accident site first, but lacking sufficient information to pinpoint the crash location, and with fog banks still around, the pilot landed at St Mary's for more information.AAIB 1985, p. 16. Langley-Williams said that at one point, the helicopter had been right above them, but unable to see them in the fog. Around this time, the Robert Edgar arrived at the accident site, which it was able to identify due to the smell of aircraft fuel. The lifeboat crew spotted and rescued the six survivors, who had been in the water for around an hour, and began looking for any others. A second Navy helicopter, a Westland Sea King, arrived around 1:00pm, and was directed to the crash site by flares from the lifeboat, which returned to St Mary's with the survivors not long after. The crew of the Sea King helicopter spotted the sponsons floating in the water, and dispatched a diver, who was later joined by the diver from the Wessex helicopter. The Wessex collected one of the survivors from St Mary's and transported her to Treliske Hospital in Truro. At 3:25pm, both divers were picked up from the water, and the Navy abandoned their search; the Sea King returned to Culdrose.AAIB 1985, pp. 16–17. David Harris, the Member of Parliament (MP) for St Ives, the constituency which contained both Penzance and the Isles of Scilly praised the rescue, singling out Matt Lethbridge, the coxswain of the St Mary's lifeboat for particular commendation. Recovery Oscar November being recovered from the sea On the evening of the crash, the MV Seaforth Clansman, a Royal Navy charter in Naval Party 1007, sailed from Falmouth with a crew of divers, arriving at the site that the survivors had been picked up at 10:10pm. The following morning, two inspectors from the Accidents Investigation Branch arrived with acoustic detectors that would allow them to locate the helicopter wreckage using its underwater locator beacon. It took until 6:00pm that evening to get an accurate position for the helicopter, but sea conditions meant that they could not commence diving until early the following morning. The divers located the helicopter fuselage at 9:10pm.AAIB 1985, pp. 13–14. The fuselage was lying on its side on the seabed, below the surface on a steep dune. At around 12:00pm on 19 July, the helicopter was lifted out of the sea and onto Seaforth Clansmans deck. Bodies of only 17 of the 20 missing people were found in the wreckage; two passengers and Lander, the cabin attendant, were not recovered. The Seaforth Clansman and the Penlee lifeboat RNLB Mabel Alice brought the wreckage and the bodies to Penzance. The aircraft had lost its nose-cone and sponsons. The starboard sponson was damaged but retained its capacity to float; the port was undamaged and failed to float. Three of the five main blades had been sheared off, along with the rear rotor blades. The cabin was badly damaged. The port-side escape windows were missing.AAIB 1985, p. 15. Investigation Two days after the incident, during a discussion in Parliament, Robert Hughes, Labour MP for Aberdeen North, called for a public inquiry into the safety record of Sikorsky helicopters, citing that there had been over 400 \\"notifiable occurrences\\" involving the Sikorsky S-61. The Secretary of State for Transport, Tom King, referred to the previous excellent safety record of the helicopter, which had not been involved in a fatal incident in the United Kingdom for ten years, and said that he had full confidence in the Accidents Investigation Branch investigation. From Penzance, the fuselage was transported by road to the Accidents Investigation Branch at Farnborough, Hampshire for investigation. An article in The Times initial speculated that the helicopter could have flown into a flock of seagulls, after mutilated bird corpses were found near the scene, or suffered a mechanical failure. Lynda King Taylor, a reporter who flew over to the Isles of Scilly around the same time as the crash reported that on her British Airways Helicopters flight there had been a number of safety shortcomings; her passenger ticket did not have her name on it, the safety announcement was inaudible due to the noise generated by the helicopter, there was no safety leaflet at her seat, passengers were allowed to walk around the helicopter even when the seatbelt sign was illuminated, and the location of the emergency exits were not highlighted to passengers. These issues were contested by British Airways Helicopters, and along with the theories about the seagulls and a mechanical failure, none were found to have caused the crash or the high loss of life in the Accidents Investigation Branch report.AAIB 1985. The preliminary report was published by the AIB on 4 August 1983, and the final report was released in March 1985. =Cause= The AIB investigation was carried out by one of their investigators, D. A. Cooper. He concluded that the helicopter was mechanically fine, and that the accident had been a collision during \\"controlled flight\\", rather than a ditching.AAIB 1985, p. 25. He found that the cause was pilot error, specifically that Lawlor did not notice and remedy an \\"unintentional descent\\" while intending to fly at . The report noted that Lawlor was attempting to fly by visual reference while the visibility was both \\"poor and deceptive\\", though within the relevant guidelines. Cooper noted that the weather conditions were unsuitable for visual flight, and listed the minimum guidelines for visual flight in the operating procedures as a contributory factor in the crash, along with too little monitoring of flight instruments and a lack of an audio altitude warning.AAIB 1985, p. 33. During the coroner's inquest, Lawlor admitted that he was partly to blame for the crash, admitting that his piloting \\"undoubtedly did play a part in the accident\\". Twenty months before the flight, the British Airline Pilots' Association had recommended to the Civil Aviation Authority that weather minima for visual flights were unsatisfactory, but the recommendations were still being reviewed at the time of the flight. The minima listed in the British Airways Helicopters operating manual was similar to other helicopter operators, though Cooper noted that too much discretion was allowed to the flight crew regarding how much they monitored flight instruments during a visual flight.AAIB 1985, pp. 27–32. Legacy The Accident Investigation Branch made eight recommendations.AAIB 1985, page 40 The main recommendation from the report was for an audible height warning on passenger helicopters operating off-shore and for the altimeter to be moved nearer to the pilot's 'head-up field of vision'. Ground proximity warning systems had been made compulsory on passenger planes in 1977. The United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority made it mandatory that audible ground proximity warning systems had to be installed in all passenger helicopters by August 1985. It was also recommended that the strength of both the passenger and attendant seats should be improved. All of the twin seats inside Oscar November sheared off, while the single seats remained fixed. The report suggested the weather minima for visual flight, and the related crew instrument monitoring procedures should be reviewed for helicopter flight, along with the specific altimeter and minimum Runway Visual Range (distance a pilot can see while approaching a runway) rules for the Penzance–St Mary's route. In order to aid rescue efforts, it was further recommended that helicopters being used for public transport should be fitted with an automatically deployable survival radio beacon, and the pilots should wear lifejackets with dual frequency personal locator beacons. The crash remained the deadliest helicopter incident in the United Kingdom until 1986, when a British International Helicopters Chinook crashed on approach to land at Sumburgh Airport in the Shetland Islands, killing 43 passengers and two crew members.

It was the third online magazine Manley established as part of his Modern Tales family of websites. Girlamatic was created as a place where both female artists and readers could feel comfortable and featured a diverse mix of genres. When the site launched, the most recent webcomic pages and strips were free, and the website's archives were available by subscription. The editorial role was held by Hernandez from 2003 until 2006, when it was taken over by Arcana Jayne-creator Lisa Jonté, one of the site's original artists. In 2009, Girlamatic was relaunched as a free digital magazine, this time edited by Spades-creator Diana McQueen. The archives of the webcomics that ran on Girlamatic remained freely available until the website was discontinued in 2013. Concept Lea Hernandez's vision when creating Girlamatic was to create a website that she herself would like to read and where both female artists and readers could feel comfortable. The website allowed readers and creators to avoid the male-dominated direct market of superhero comic books. Talking with Publishers Weekly in 2004, Hernandez said \\"an anthology of girl- friendly comics would sink like a stone in the direct market.\\" Hernandez said she had gathered artists of \\"the new mainstream\\" and she hoped they would find a wider audience for their work through Girlamatic. The name \\"Girlamatic\\" was chosen to signify the difference between it and other comic platforms. Hernandez initially wanted to name the website \\"ModernGirls\\", but this name was already taken by a porn site. Webcartoonist Shaenon K. Garrity noted that she liked the website's name for its \\"juxtaposition of squishy girliness with hard retro tech,\\" saying that the website has always blended a large variety of themes, including \\"cuteness and horror, comedy and melodrama, gruesome darkness and giggly light, femininity and masculinity.\\" Lisa Jonté stated that Girlamatic's inclusion criteria was essentially \\"whatever appeals to the editor ... we want engaging stories with well-developed characters.\\" Jonté did note that she mainly wanted to stay away from female sex-appeal and \\"frilly pink melodrama.\\" Girlamatic was the third webcomic subscription service launched and managed by Joey Manley, following the success of Modern Tales and Serializer.net. This subscription model was revolutionary at the time, and was one of the first profitable subscription models for webcomics. History Spike Trotman published her first major webcomics on Girlamatic. Girlamatic launched on March 31, 2003 with sixteen artists: Donna Barr, Vera Brosgol, Kris Dresen, Shaenon K. Garrity, Lisa Jonté, Layla Lawlor, Jenn Manley Lee, Dylan Meconis, Andre Richard, Harley Sparx, Spike Trotman, Jason Thompson, Carla Speed McNeil, Rachel Hartman, Jesse Hamm, and Tochi. Girlamatic archives could be accessed for $2.95 USD per month or $29.95 per year. The service had ten regular features in its first year. When Hernandez posted an open call for new submissions in 2004, she found a large number of creators were willing to join the platform. Eleven new features were added to Girlamatic in April 2004. Arcana Jayne creator Lisa Jonté took over Hernandez's role as editor in early 2006. At this point, Girlamatic sent out an open call to creators once or twice per year. Brigid Alverson of Comic Book Resources noted that Girlamatic went \\"quiet\\" between 2007 and 2009. During this period, all of Joey Manley's websites merged into comics-oriented social media and publishing platform ComicSpace, which he developed in collaboration with OnlineComics.net creator Josh Robert. Girlamatic relaunched on July 31, 2009. This time, artist Diana McQueen (creator of Spades) took over as the editor, and subscription fees were dropped entirely. Despite this, McQueen said Girlamatic had not become a hosting website or artist community, but remained a magazine. McQueen also brought in two bloggers: Nick Popio of Hobotaku posted reviews of manga, anime, and western comics, while Elizabeth Shupe wrote blog posts about dolls. Girlamatic was the first of Manley's Modern Tales-family of subscription services to relaunch on ComicSpace. McQueen believed the subscription model of the Modern Tales-family had failed and too few readers were willing to pay for online media. Girlamatic went on to have limited online advertising handled by the ComicSpace ad network. McQueen aspired to have print editions of Girlamatic in the tradition of Shojo Beat, but none were ever released. ComicSpace never achieved success, and Girlamatic closed alongside Manley's other websites in April 2013. Webcomics Raina Telgemeier stated that serializing a weekly webcomic on Girlamatic \\"[offered] just enough structure to finally tell a story\\" she had in mind for years. Several cartoonists made their professional debut through Girlamatic, while other artists serialized their existing work on the service. *Von Allen's 2007 graphic novel the road to god knows… was serialized on Girlamatic. *Svetlana Chmakova's first professional work was publishing Chasing Rainbows on Girlamatic. *Barry Deutch began publishing Hereville on Girlamatic in 2004. *Shaenon K. Garrity published a spin-off of her webcomic Narbonic on Girlamatic, titled Li'l Mell and Sergio. *Rachel Hartman published Return of the Mad Bun on Girlamatic as a follow-up to her print comic series Amy Unbounded. *Lea Hernandez published a sequel to her comic book Rumble Girls: Silky Warrior Tansie on the website, titled Rumble Girls: Runaway Lightning Ohmry. *Hope Larson published I Was There & Just Returned on Girlamatic while a senior in art school. *Layla Lawlor published Kismet: Hunter's Moon on Girlamatic. *Dave Roman began releasing Astronaut Elementary on Girlamatic in 2004. *Tara Tallan ran her print comic Galaxion on Girlamatic from 2006 to 2010. *Raina Telgemeier began serializing her Baby Sitter's Club and Smile graphic novels on Girlamatic in 2004. *Jason Thompson moved his 2001 webcomic The Stiff onto Girlamatic. *Spike Trotman published her first big webcomic projects through Girlamatic, Sparkneedle and Lucas and Odessa. Two new webcomics were added to the Girlamatic roster during its 2009 relaunch: The Continentals by Darryl Hughes and Monique McNaughton, and Godseeker by Lisa Gilbert and Terry Blauer. Reception Many critics were unsure what to make of the website when it launched in 2003. Writing for The Comics Journal, columnist Ted Rall initially proclaimed the website a \\"ghetto for women cartoonists\\". In 2005, blogger Eric Burns said he felt uncomfortable entering a space that was mainly set up for women. He also voiced concern that initiatives like Girlamatic might section off and divide the webcomic community, making it less likely for male readers to come across the works of female webcartoonists. In 2006, comic book author Gail Simone called Girlamatic \\"one of the most important venues for female- friendly comics created to date.\\" Girlamatic has received various Lulu awards and nominations for being among the \\"most women-friendly and reader-friendly work in comics.\\" References  External links  *, archived using the Wayback Machine Webcomic syndicates Internet properties established in 2003 Internet properties disestablished in 2013 ","title":"Girlamatic"},{"id":"2827977","text":"The Lime Twig (1961) is an experimental novel by American writer John Hawkes. Plot In England after World War II, a sedate, bored lower-class couple—Michael and Margaret Banks—are lured into fronting a racehorse scheme. Michael is befriended by William Hencher, a well-meaning but lost soul who fell into association with a ruthless gang during the war. After his mother's death, Hencher wants to repay the Bankses for their allowing him to rent a room in their home, where he had lived with his mother for twenty years. Knowing Michael likes horses, Hencher invites him to the heist of the racehorse Rock Castle—which goes awry, leading to Hencher's death. The gang members then keep Michael under wraps. Realizing that Margaret is becoming suspicious of Michael's absence, they force Michael to call and tell her to meet him at a party. In order to ensure that Michael will front as the owner of the stolen stallion, they kidnap Margaret while distracting Michael with two women, both sexual predators. The heavy of the gang, Thick, beats Margaret mercilessly with a truncheon after she attempts to escape; Larry, the kingpin of the gang, slashes and rapes her. Meanwhile, Michael finds pleasure in a femme fatale, Sybilline, the mistress of Larry—as well as two other women. Badly beaten in a street fight with a constable, Michael attempts to redeem himself from both criminal activity and infidelity by thwarting the race, which has been set up in order to allow Larry to retire to America in comfort. Style and structure The work is told in a framed narrative, with the commentary of the sports writer Sidney Slyter prefacing each chapter (at the request of Hawkes' publisher New Directions, who feared that the novella would be too confusing otherwise). Hencher narrates the first chapter, which concerns his recollections of life with his mother during World War II. The other chapters are all presented in a third-person limited style with a focus on the banal inner lives of Michael and Margaret Banks. The style is one of broken, dreamlike sequences, which suspend time in a quintessentially postmodern fashion. The novella's accumulation of events acts as wish fulfillment run amok for Michael and Margaret, both of whom become helplessly entrapped in fantasies that turn into nightmares. Hawkes underscores the theme of entrapment imagistically, with fleeting references to a sparrow attacked by a hive of bees, a wasp trapped between panes of glass, and so on. The title of the novel itself refers to the old practice of catching birds by spreading lime on a twig, the master trope of the narrative. Influential American literary critic Leslie Fiedler contributed a preface, arguing for Hawkes' greatness: \\"For the sake of art and the truth, [Hawkes] dissolves the rational universe which we are driven, for the sake of sanity and peace, to manufacture out of the chaos of memory, impression, reflex and fantasy.\\" Southern writer Flannery O'Connor (a friend of Hawkes) praised the novel as well, commenting in a letter that \\"You suffer The Lime Twig like a dream. It seems to be something that is happening to you, that you want to escape from but can't.\\" Secondary Literature * Robert I.

He was the son of Fakhr al-Dawla.  Biography  Fakhr al-Dawla died in 997; his elder son Abu Taleb Rostam (\\"Majd al-Dawla\\") took power in the bulk of his father's possessions in Jibal. Abu Taher himself gained the governorships of Hamadan and Kirmanshah, and was hence known as Shams al-Dawla. Since both sons were still minors their mother, the \\"Sayyida\\", assumed the regency. Both sons originally took the title of Shâhanshâh, implying that they were subordinate to no one. They abandoned the title, however, when they accepted their cousin Baha' al-Dawla's authority by 1009 or 1010 at the latest. In 1006 or 1007, Majd al-Dawla tried to throw of the Sayyida's regency. However, she gained the support of the Kurdish ruler Badr ibn Hasanwaih and Shams al-Dawla. Their forces laid siege to Ray and fought several battles with Majd al-Dawla's forces. When Ray was finally taken, Majd al-Dawla was imprisoned for a year, and Shams al-Dawla ruled in the city during that time. When the Sayyida released Majd al-Dawla, Shams al-Dawla returned to Hamadan. Around 1013, following the death of the Badr ibn Hasanwaih, Shams al-Dawla occupied part of the former ruler's territory. Sometime in the later part of his reign, he tried to replace Majd al-Dawla as the ruler of Ray, but the Sayyida foiled his plans. In 1015, Shams al-Dawla called upon the prominent Persian scholar Avicenna in order to treat him. During Avicenna's stay at Shams al-Dawla's court, the latter became his vizier. Shams al-Dawla later died in 1021 and was succeeded by his son Sama' al-Dawla.

Police intelligence refers to an element of the British police. Staffed by police officers and support staff, its purpose is to track and predict crime with a view to curbing it. It is an emerging field that gained momentum after the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) launched the National Intelligence Model, which formalised the contribution intelligence makes to policing. There are also intelligence units at divisional level (DIU).  Function  The Intelligence analysts investigate who is committing crimes, how, when, where and why. They then provide recommendations on how to stop or curb the offences. As part of this, analysts produce profiles of crime problems and individual subjects, and produce both strategic (overall, long- term) and tactical (specific, short-term) assessments within the confines set by the individual police force. These assessments and profiles are used to both monitor and predict crime, aiming to move policing from \\"reactionary\\" investigation to \\"proactive\\" investigation. Analysts look for links between a wide variety of intelligence sources to work out what is going on, and make recommendations on how to stop it. This is done at all levels, from local police stations dealing with town issues, to whole county crime, regional crime and beyond.  Personnel  At the heart of police intelligence is the intelligence analyst. Analysts are drawn from diverse backgrounds; some are graduates from any academic background and some are retired police officers. Most have experience working in an analytical field. They are recruited on a per-vacancy basis directly by the police force that will employ them, not through any national scheme. Analysts work very closely with regular police officers on particular areas of crime; an analyst might work with a police officer on a vehicle crime desk, or a violent crime desk, for example. Opportunities exist for progression within the profession; while individual forces differ, an analyst can become a lead analyst, senior analyst or principal analyst. Opportunities are likely to exist for analysts to work on a national level with the Serious Organised Crime Agency, now the National Crime Agency.  Tools  Analysts have a huge, even endless, variety of sources to work from. These include the UK National DNA Database, Police National Computer, crimint, crime reports and information from witnesses, information from informants and agents, local knowledge, surveillance logs, force intelligence summaries and even newspaper reports. Intelligence Units have staff whose job is to build up and develop intelligence (such as the police officers mentioned above), and analysts are expected to make sense of this information and identify gaps for intelligence-gathering officers to fill. Analysts have a number of IT systems to help make sense of the information, including i2, bespoke police information management systems, geographical mapping tools and social mapping tools. They often work closely and exchange information with other law enforcement agencies, including the Serious Organised Crime Agency, other police forces and MI5.

The genus is recognized in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), but not by some other sources, which keep it in a broadly defined Huperzia. Taxonomy The genus was first described in 1909 by Wilhelm Herter as the section Phlegmariurus of the genus Lycopodium. The section was elevated to a genus by Josef Ludwig Holub in 1964. Within the family Lycopodiaceae, Phlegmariurus is placed in the subfamily Huperzioideae. A phylogenetic study in 2016, employing both molecular and morphological data, concluded that either a one-genus or a three-genus division of the subfamily produced monophyletic taxa. The authors preferred the three-genus division, recognizing Huperzia, Phlegmariurus and Phylloglossum. Their preferred hypothesis for the relationships of the three genera was: The majority of the species formerly placed in a broadly defined Huperzia belong in Phlegmariurus. However, the genera are difficult to separate morphologically, and others have preferred the one-genus division of the subfamily. =Species= , the Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World accepted over 300 species: *Phlegmariurus acerosus (Sw.)

It was first inhabited by the Ohlone indigenous people, and was later claimed by Spanish settlers and Mexican ranchers. History The United States Army acquired the land in the late 1930s as part of a larger defense network that protected San Francisco Bay, including similar fortifications in San Francisco, Angel Island and the Marin Headlands. In 1943 the Army started construction of Battery Construction No. 244 on top of Milagra Ridge, which was called Milagra Ridge Military Reservation at the time. Two 6-inch (152 mm) T2/M1 guns mounted on shielded long-range barbette M4 carriages were moved from Fort Columbia to Battery 244 in 1948. The battery was decommissioned in 1950. Plans were drawn up to build a second gun emplacement armed with larger 16-inch guns, Battery Construction No. 130, but World War II ended before construction started on Battery 130. In 1956 Nike missile site SF-51 was built here and converted to the Nike-Hercules system in 1958. Typical of Nike sites, SF-51 was divided into an administrative area (SF-51A), an integrated fire control area (SF-51C), and a launcher area (SF-51L); SF-51A and -51L lie within the area of Milagra Ridge, while SF-51C is in the neighboring Sweeney Ridge open space preserve. In 1961, Pacifica considered utilizing the empty Battery 244 casemate as their police station combined with an emergency civil defense headquarters for the County of San Mateo, but in 1969, a different location was chosen, partially due to limited access to the site. However, the City of Pacifica leased some of the underground area to the County for records storage in 1970. In January 1971, some students from Oceana High School broke into the bunker and set the records on fire, followed by another group of arsonists setting fires with highway flares in March 1972. Shortly afterward, officials stopped using the bunker. The National Guard assumed management of the Nike missile site between 1963 through March 1974, when it was decommissioned and, in May 1974, the land was turned over to the City of Pacifica. Prior to the land transfer, several areas had already been turned over, including in 1962 (eventually becoming residential parcels) and in 1972, first to the Department of the Interior and then to the City of Pacifica in 1974. The buildings at SF-51A were demolished in 1983 and a condominium complex was built on that site. In 1987 the National Park Service acquired the remaining of Milagra Ridge and made it a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Community based volunteer efforts have successfully improved the habitat of the Mission Blue and San Bruno elfin butterflies, the San Francisco garter snake and the California red-legged frog, all of which are endangered or threatened species. Residents of Pacifica's Manor district formed the Concerned Manor Residents, which brought a referendum in 1995 to successfully block a large proposed development on the lower slopes of Milagra Ridge; a smaller group of 23 homes was built as a compromise. Today, it is a protected area and is open for hiking. A new trail, the Milagra Battery Trail, was completed in November 2016. It provides access to Milagra Ridge from a small parking lot at the end of Connemara Drive in Pacifica along a trail approximately long and wide. Milagra Battery Trail is located in of land set aside as a conservation easement in a 2007 agreement between the National Park Service and O'Brien Homes and is part of the Bay Area Ridge Trail, along with the existing trail through Milagra Ridge to Sweeney Ridge. The conservation easement was added to the park's land, bringing it up to . In the late Spring, the area provides thousands of tiny wild coast strawberries interspersed with poison oak.

Most members were arrested and executed after attending a tea party in Berlin September 10, 1943 at the residence of Elisabeth von Thadden. The group's downfall also ultimately led to the demise of the Abwehr in February 1944.  Background  Hanna Solf was the widow of Dr. Wilhelm Solf, who served as Imperial Colonial Secretary before the outbreak of World War I and ambassador to Japan under the Weimar Republic and, like her husband, was a political moderate and anti-Nazi. After her husband's death in 1936 she had presided over a circle of anti-Nazi intellectuals in her salon in Berlin, reminiscent of the SeSiSo Club, together with her daughter, the Countess So'oa'emalelagi \\"Lagi\\" von Ballestrem-Solf. They included career officers from the Foreign Office, industrialists and writers, and they would meet regularly to discuss the war and relief for the Jews and political enemies of the regime; Solf and her daughter were responsible for hiding many Jews and providing them with documents for them to emigrate safely. They also had links with other anti-Nazi groups like the Kreisau Circle. The tea party and betrayal of the Solf Circle Otto Kiep On September 10, 1943, the Solf Circle met at a birthday party given by Elisabeth von Thadden, the Protestant headmistress of a famous girls' school in Wieblingen, near Heidelberg. Among the guests were: * Otto Kiep, a high official from the Foreign Office, who was once dismissed from his position as Consul General in New York City for attending a public luncheon in honor of Albert Einstein, but was able to get himself reinstated in the diplomatic service; * the Countess Hannah von Bredow, the granddaughter of Otto von Bismarck; * Count Albrecht von Bernstorff,On the Rhodes Scholar Albrecht von Bernstorff, see Donald Markwell, \\"Instincts to Lead\\": On Leadership, Peace, and Education, Connor Court, Australia, 2013 the nephew of Count Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, the German ambassador to the United States during World War I; * Father Friedrich Erxleben, a well-known Jesuit priest; * Nikolaus von Halem, a merchant; hanged for conspiracy to kill Hitler; * Legation adviser Richard Kuenzer; * State Secretary Arthur Zarden and his daughter Irmgard. The following paragraphs are paraphrased from William Shirer's, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\": To the party, Thadden brought a handsome Swiss doctor named Paul Reckzeh,see german Wikipedia :de:Paul Reckzeh who was said to be practising at the Charité Hospital in Berlin under Professor Ferdinand Sauerbruch. Like most Swiss, he expressed anti-Nazi sentiments in a discussion joined by others present, most vocal of which were Kiep and Bernstorff. Before the end of the party, Reckzeh offered to convey the correspondence of those present to their friends in Switzerland, an offer which many accepted. However, Reckzeh was actually an agent or informer working for the Gestapo, and he turned over these letters and reported on the gathering. Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, a member of the Kreisau Circle, learned of this betrayal through a friend in the Air Ministry who had tapped a number of telephone conversations between Reckzeh and the Gestapo, and he quickly informed Kiep, who in turn informed the rest of the guests. They hurriedly fled for their lives, but it was too late, as Heinrich Himmler had his evidence. He waited four months to act on it, hoping to cast a wider net; apparently he succeeded, for on January 12, 1944, some seventy-four persons, including everyone who had been in the tea party, were arrested. The Solfs themselves fled to Bavaria and were caught by the Gestapo; they were then incarcerated in Ravensbrück concentration camp. Moltke himself was arrested at this time due to his connection with Kiep. But that was not the only consequence of Kiep's arrest - its repercussions spread as far as Turkey, and resulted in the final demise of the Abwehr, already under suspicion as a hotbed of anti-Nazi activity. The defection of Erich Vermehren and the dissolution of the Abwehr Among Kiep's close friends were Erich Vermehren and his wife, the former Countess Elisabeth von Plettenberg. Vermehren, by profession a lawyer from Hamburg, was prevented from taking up a Rhodes scholarship in Oxford in 1938 because he repeatedly refused to join the Hitler Youth. Excluded from military service because of a childhood injury, he managed to get himself assigned to the Istanbul branch of the Abwehr. He also managed to get his wife to follow him, despite the Gestapo's efforts to detain her in Germany as a hostage. When Kiep was arrested, the Vermehrens were summoned to Berlin by the Gestapo to be interrogated in connection with their friend's case. Knowing what would be in store for them, they got in touch with the British Secret Intelligence Service in February, 1944, and were flown to Cairo and thence to England. When the news of the defection broke - courtesy of British propaganda - it became the talk of Berlin. Although the Vermehrens did not bring any documents of any intelligence value or ciphers to the Allies, it was believed that they absconded with the Abwehr's secret codes and handed them over to the British. Ultimately the capture of the Solf Circle and the subsequent defection of Vemehren exposed how the presence of Resistance agents and Allied spies had infiltrated within the Abwehr inner circle. This proved to be the last straw for Adolf Hitler. On February 18, he ordered that the Abwehr be dissolved and its functions taken over by the RSHA, under Himmler's jurisdiction. The disintegration of the Abwehr caused the resignation of hundreds of officers who took up positions elsewhere rather than serve the SS. While the demise of the Abwehr was an unexpected but welcome boon to the Allies, it also deprived the German armed forces of an intelligence service of its own, and was a further blow to those among the anti-Nazi conspirators against Hitler who had also used the Abwehr's resources. The fate of some members of the Solf Circle Most members of the Solf Circle were tried and convicted in Roland Freisler's Volksgerichtshof, and eventually executed. Kiep himself was subjected to severe torture; while he was being interrogated after his conviction, the Gestapo learned of his involvement with the July 20 Plot. He was executed in Plötzensee Prison on August 15, 1944. Elisabeth von Thadden also met the same fate on September 8. Arthur Zarden, knowing what was in store for him and afraid to implicate others under torture, committed suicide on January 18, 1944 by throwing himself out a window at the Gestapo interrogation center. Irmgard Zarden (his daughter) spent five months in Ravensbrück concentration camp before being acquitted for lack of evidence. Bernstorff was confined to Ravensbrück together with Solf and repeatedly tortured. He was then sent to the prison in Prinz Albrecht Straße to stand trial in the Volksgerichtshof. However, Roland Freisler did not have the satisfaction of sentencing him because he was killed in an air raid on February 3, 1945. When the Red Army liberated the prison on April 25, he was not among the living. Together with Richard Kuenzer, Bernstorff was taken out of the prison two days before to the vicinity of the Lehrter Bahnhof, and presumably shot upon the orders of Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Nazi Foreign Minister.Kurt Singer, Hitlers Weltkrieg 1939-1945, Die Dänische Friedens Akademie. (In German). Retrieved 2010-03-20. Nikolaus von Halem was arrested on 26 February 1942 and suffered through a number of prisons and concentration camps, including Sachsenhausen. In June 1944, shortly before the 20 July 1944 coup attempt, the People's Court indicted Halem for conspiracy to commit treason and undermining the war effort. He was sentenced to death and hanged on October 9, 1944. The fate of the Solfs Solf and her daughter So'oa'emalelagi were interned in Ravensbrück after their arrest. In December 1944 they were transferred to Moabit Remand Prison while awaiting their trial in the Volksgerichtshof. The considerable delay in their trial was at least in part due to the efforts of the Japanese ambassador, Hiroshi Ōshima, who knew the Solfs. Their trial was further delayed because the same air raid that killed Freisler on February 3, 1945 also destroyed the dossier on the Solfs, which was in the files of the Volksgerichtshof.The reference to Oshima's intervention is in William L. Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. However, according to Eugen Solf, a grandson of Dr. Wilhelm and Hanna Solf who is doing research of his family during the Nazi Period: :\\"I think the Japanese Government did not intervene, and if it did, the Nazis, or better the Foreign Ministry, did most certainly not react to that request. On July 7, 1944 the attorney Dr Kurt Behling wrote to another attorney about these fruitless attempts. (source: estate of Dr Behling, National Archives, Koblenz, Germany). :On July 18, the Ministry of Justice issued a \\"Führerinformation\\" (an information by the \\"Führer\\") describing the court case of July 1, and the fact that the case against Johanna Solf was separated from the other cases because new evidence was found against her. According to the state attorney, the death sentence for Solf had been seriously considered (Führerinformation, RJustMin 1944, Nr 144). :On July 24 Behling wrote a note after a discussion with someone at the Ministry of Justice who said 'the case against Solf is absolutely serious and the death sentence will be seriously considered' (Behling estate, National Archives). By that time the July 20 Plot (Stauffenberg) must have played a serious role in these considerations. :It is therefore more than uncertain that the Japanese Government's possible interventions bore any fruit. :It is by no means certain that the Solf dossier was destroyed when Freisler was killed on February 3, 1945.\\" :http://wais.stanford.edu/Germany/germany_resistance.htm Nevertheless, they were finally scheduled to be tried on April 27, but they were released from Moabit on April 23, apparently because of an error brought about by the confusion caused by the entry of the Red Army into Berlin. After the war, Solf went to England while her daughter was reunited with her husband, Count Hubert Ballestrem, who was an officer in the Wehrmacht and lived in Berlin. Solf died on November 4, 1954 in Starnberg, Bavaria. Countess von Ballestrem died on December 4, 1955 at the age of 46, her early death attributable to her incarceration.

This genre was founded based on the Japanese reception of naturalism during the Meiji period, and later influenced literature in other Asian countries as well. This genre of literature reflects greater individuality and a less constrained method of writing. From its beginnings, the I-novel has been a genre that also is meant to expose aspects of society or of the author's life.  History  = Origin = The first I-novels are believed to be The Broken Commandment, written in 1906 by Tōson Shimazaki, and Futon (The Quilt) written by Katai Tayama in 1907. Futon, written by Tayama Katai in 1907, is not only considered as the first works in this novel, but also a model. In Futon, the protagonist confesses his affection for a female pupil. In The Broken Commandment, Shimazaki described a male who was born a member of a discriminated segment of the population (burakumin), and how he decided to violate his father's commandment not to reveal his community of birth. = Social Background = In the mid-1800s, European power and the US forced Tokugawa shogunate to end its policy of isolation. Japan faced great external pressure which pushed it towards political and cultural renewal. After Meiji restoration between 1860s and mid-1880s, there were enormous intellectual activities between Japan and Western powers, including translation of books on politics, philosophy and science into Japanese. The new government encouraged this kind of activities in order to inform and educate its people. Shoyo tsubouchi was one of the scholars and writers who worked to introduce Western ideas into Japan. He claimed the importance of intrinsic value of fiction as an artistic genre, which provided insight into people's psychological aspects. He strongly opposed literature in Edo period which was weak in depicting characters' emotion. He believed that fiction should be self-relevant and his thoughts lead to major innovations. Later, in order to withstand political and military challenge posed by Western powers, Meiji government proposed the slogan \\"rich nation and strong army\\", which lead to centralization of power. Young scholars in Meiji period were not satisfied with such policy and turned to Western literature and philosophy, from which they began to re-evaluate fiction (shosetsu, novel). Another important scholar who played an important role in this process is Fukuzawa Yukichi. He believed that people are born equal. He also emphasized importance of individual self-respect, as well as national independence and freedom. This idea of individualism was later supported enthusiastically by Meiji scholars. 1889, Meiji Constitution was established, which emphasized on the absolute and divine power of the Tenno, and the notion of \\"Kokutai(nation body)\\". Japan entered the period of nationalism. Young scholars who believed in individualism and liberty were disappointed by the militaristic and nationalist politics and then turned to \\"the path that leads inwards\\". The literary climate during this period was dominated by Romanticism, Neo-Idealism and Individualism.  Definition  = Language Style = The Japanese language contains a number of different words for \\"I\\"; mostly, the formal is used in the I-novel. Other words \\"I\\" such as Boku and Jibun may also be seen in some works. There are also some instances where the author uses third-person pronouns or a named main character (such as Yozo in No Longer Human ) to present the stories as experience of others or fictional. = Framework = There are several general rules for the creation of an I-novel: The first and most important one is that I-novel is often written from the first-person perspective (which is where the \\"I\\" of I-novel comes from). I-novel is categorized as \\"reality\\", and the most important framework is \\"jitsu(real), or \\"makoto(sincere)\\". This framework restricts the narrative to \\"the life experienced by the author\\", and fiction will make the work no longer considered as not real/sincere. \\" \\"Reality\\" in I-novel is defined from 3 aspects. The first one is one-to-one relationship between the author's experience and the story in the novel, though slight difference is acceptable. The second one is \\"inner reality\\". Rather than reflecting accurate facts, I-novel emphasizes more on real spiritual condition of the author. The third one is from the reader's perspective. An I-novel should appear natural and unplanned to its readers. = Difference from autobiography = Autobiography usually presents the whole large picture and provide a comprehensive life story of the author. While I-Novels are more personal and emotional, focusing on greater depth and feeling of a particular experience happening to the author  Authors and Works * Iwano Homei \\"Tandeki\\" * Chikamatsu Shuko \\"Giwaku\\" * Shiga Naoya \\"Wakai\\" * Kasai Zenzo \\"Ko o tsurete\\" * Kikuchi Kan \\"Tomo to tomo no aida\\" * Hayashi Fumiko \\"Horoki\\" * Miura Tetsuo \\"Shinobugawa\\" * Dazai Osamu \\"Ningen shikkaku\\" * Tōson Shimazaki \\"The Broken Commandment\\" * Tayama Katai \\"Futon\\"  I-novel in China  Influence of I-novel in China started with the early self-referential fiction of Creation Society. I-novel had an brief ascendancy in China during May Fourth period. Despite the increasing scarcity of this kind of narratives during 1930s, its popularity among writers wasn't completely eradicated. And in the 1940s, many self- referential works written by woman writers such as Xiao Hong and Ding Ling were published. In addition, Yu Dafu continued to produce various self- referential works until he died in 1945. This trend set the foundation for more self-referential works in 1980s. Members of Creation Society at first learned from Western literature, then shifted to Japanese I-novel, since they were dissatisfied with the existing modes of expression and desired to develop a new mode of narrative which was more consistent with their ideals of modern literary expression. Recently,Chinese critics also argue that limited exposure to Western culture lead May Fourth writers to eventually transit to Japanese I-novel which they had direct contact with.

It is scored for two sopranos, three tenors, string quartet, percussion, keyboards, and pre-recorded audio. Its premiere was at the Vienna Festival on May 12, 2002; the BBC had commissioned a version for television broadcast four months later. The 12-minute tale Hindenburg had been written (and recorded) in 1998, while the remaining tales were completed (and recorded) in the year of the premiere. The musical narrative of Three Tales follows \\"speech melodies\\" of pre-recorded interviews, and in many ways resembles Reich's works The Cave (1990–1993), City Life (1995) and Different Trains (1988). The libretto of Three Tales can be found on the website of the composer (see bottom of page). Three Tales is a response to nearly a hundred years of modern technology, concerning the explosion of the Hindenburg, nuclear testings on Bikini Atoll, and the cloning of Dolly the sheep (drawing connections between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence). The different stories are told from various perspectives, with speech culled from interviews with eyewitnesses, audiovisual documentary material of both the Hindenburg and Bikini tragedies, and experts in computer science (e.g. Marvin Minsky and Kevin Warwick), artificial intelligence (Rodney Brooks), Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, and genetic engineering (Richard Dawkins).  Synopsis  The three tales (acts) divide into various sub-sections: Act I – Hindenburg : It could not have been a technical matter – Nibelung Zeppelin – A very impressive thing to see – I couldn't understand It Act II – Bikini : In the air I – The atoll I – On the ships I – In the air II – The atoll II – On the ships II – In the air III – The atoll III - On the ships III - Coda Act III – Dolly : Cloning - Dolly - Human body machine - Darwin - Interlude - Robots/Cyborgs/Immortality Performers * vocal quintet: 2 sopranos, 3 tenors * 4 percussionists: 2 vibraphones, 2 snare drums, 2 pedal bass drums, suspended cymbal, large gong * 2 pianos * string quartet (2 violins, viola, cello) * pre-recorded tape or hard disk recorderInformation on boosey.com Reception Andrew McGregor wrote a positive review for BBC Music, stating that the video for the third act (“Dolly”) was the most effective and arguing that “Reich and Korot can't give you the answer [to where the human race is headed], but they frame the questions more memorably and insistently than most.” Kila Packett also gave the opera a positive review in PopMatters; she argued that the first act (“Hindenburg”) is the most musically satisfying and the third act the most thought-provoking, and interpreted the work as a “a bittersweet love letter romanticizing the tragic beauty of destruction and the inevitable folly of human achievement”, but she found Korot’s work on the first act to “lack visual imagination”. Andrew Clements of The Guardian awarded Three Tales a full five stars, writing “The three movements get progressively weightier, more discursive, more visually inventive [...] this piece represents a quantum leap in complexity and technological achievement.” K Smith wrote an unfavorable review in Gramophone, stating that Reich and Korot seem oblivious to “how the Faustian pact with technology that they decry in society has also affected their own work.” Smith argued, “In both its emotional evocations as well as its compositional process, Three Tales is highly manipulative. [...] For artists so quick to criticise others for playing God, they prove vulnerable to the same temptation themselves.” In 2016, Clements ranked the piece as one of Reich’s 10 greatest.

She is the wife of Erec in Chrétien de Troyes' Erec and Enide, and that of Geraint in the Welsh Romance of Geraint and Enid (analogous to Chrétien's version). Some scholars believe the French and Welsh tales derive from a lost common source, but it seems more likely Geraint derives directly or indirectly from Erec, though Chrétien may have had a Welsh or Breton source. Enide and Geraint/Erec meet while the hero is on a mission to defeat a cruel knight, and her family provides him with armor and food. They fall in love and marry, but the hero begins to forsake his social and chivalric duties for domestic bliss. Rumors spread, and Enide blames herself. One night, her husband overhears her crying about damaging his reputation. In Chrétien's version, Erec begins to question Enide's love, but in Geraint the protagonist misunderstands her sobs and thinks she has been unfaithful to him. In both romances, the hero makes her accompany him on a long and dangerous trip, and forbids her to talk to him. Enide ignores this command several times to warn her husband of impending danger. Over the course of the trip, Erec/Geraint proves his abilities as a knight have not faded and accepts that Enide's love and loyalty are genuine, and the couple is reconciled. This tale was not retold in many variants, but was included in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's Idylls of the King; the hero is named Geraint, and Tennyson conforms to that version of the tale.

Description Taylor Slough is a 247 square kilometer wetland system. The slough stretches from the east everglades, to the northern portion of Florida Bay. In its natural form, Taylor Slough is the primary source of overland, freshwater flow into the north eastern part of Florida Bay. A major portion of the Taylor Slough resides in Everglades National Park. Taylor Slough crosses over part of the C-111 basin. History The term slough (pronounced slew) is used to describe areas of the Everglades where there is slightly deeper water than in the surrounding marshes and where a slow, but measurable, current is present. In essence, sloughs are the broad, shallow rivers of the Everglades. Sloughs occupy areas of slight depressions in the limestone bedrock underlying south Florida and generally remain wet during the seasonal dry period (November to May). Sloughs are important refuges for aquatic wildlife during these dry periods.

Born in Mexico City to Manuel Camacho López and Luz Solís, he belonged to the . At first he was affiliated with the PRI, later with the Party of the Democratic Center and then with the Party of the Democratic Revolution. Political career Camacho Solís joined the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1965, and in 1988 he became that party's general secretary. Camacho met Carlos Salinas at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where they became close friends. Camacho followed Salinas's trajectory in the Planning Ministry under the administration of Miguel de la Madrid. In 1985 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, and in 1986 he was appointed to the cabinet as Minister of Urban Development. When Salinas took over the presidency in 1988, Camacho was appointed Head of Government of the Federal District (1988–1993), an important political post with jurisdiction over the nation's capital. In 1997, the post became elective. He was a contender within the PRI to be the presidential candidate, but Salinas chose Colosio instead. Salinas told Camacho that he would be appointed the Head of Government of the Federal District, a powerful post, but Camacho sought to be Minister of the Interior. Before he accepted the appointment, he made demands: complete control of the district attorney's office and the police, the right to participate in political reforms, and complete authority over the city, which Salinas acceded to.

Life Born in Dudley, Worcestershire, West Midlands, England, son of Dr. James Payton Badley and Laura Elizabeth Best his wife. He was the grandson of John Badley, one of the original 300 fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons. Early in life he saw the poverty and squalor of many working class in the Midlands. When fifteen he entered the Upper School at Rugby. These early experiences were very influential in shaping his ideas of what education should not be. While a student at Trinity College Cambridge he gained the appreciation of a standard of music and theatre and he described King's Chapel as providing \\"a standard of loveliness of trained voices in that architectural setting of something near perfection.\\" His autobiography describes a tea with Oscar Wilde at which they discussed the English Poets. Here too his friendship with Edmund Garrett encouraged him to join the small minority of men who supported the women's movement for socio-political equality. In 1892 he married Garrett's sister Amy who would be a strong partner until her death in 1956, and the drive behind one of Bedales's most important innovations - successful co-education. A school, he felt, should be organized like a family, with willing cooperation for common ends as the main motive rather than on the basis of mere competition. He felt that the training for social usefulness held equal importance with the fullest possible development of the individual. At Cambridge Badley became a lifelong socialist, influenced by the ideals of William Morris about art and community life. But the decisive influence on the direction these ideas should take was Cecil Reddie founder of Abbotsholme School and arguably the originator of the 'modern' British progressive school. Graduating from Cambridge with a first class classics degree in 1887, Badley heard about the plans for Reddie's school through his university friend Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson when he came down in 1888, went there and was instantly fascinated. He was, at the age of twenty-four, one of the first masters appointed, but it is probable that from the start he had secret plans to found a school of his own. After two and a half years Reddie's increasingly autocratic temperament - and the fact that Badley wanted to marry and Reddie said he could not - gave him the impetus to leave and start his own school. He married Amy Garrett, sister of his Cambridge friend Fydell Edmund Garrett, in 1892, and in January 1893, with the help of Oswald Powell they opened their school, Bedales, in a rented property near Haywards Heath. =Startup= All Badley's initial ideas ― though their later development was quite different ― were taken from Reddie. For instance the curriculum was English based, not classical, and wide ― with science, art, music, French, German, and opportunities for plays and hobbies. Religion was non-dogmatic and non- sectarian. Boys were not crammed for exams, there were no prizes and lessons were only in the mornings. The games madness of Rugby and the conventional Public School was condemned; instead much time was spent on manual labour in fields and gardens, and the boys were also taught tailoring, boot making and cookery. Badley also copied many of the early organisational details too, right down to the earth closets which enabled him to return to the soil that which had been taken from it. He claimed, in his own modesty, to owe much to Montessori, Pestalozzi, Fröbel and Dewey. Helen Parkhurst of the Dalton Plan would draw on his experience years later in New York City. In 1898, five years after Bedales was founded, at the insistence of his wife Amy, an ardent suffragette (she was a cousin of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Millicent Fawcett), he took the further risk of engaging in a 'preposterous experiment' which led to Bedales becoming a fully coeducational boarding school. In May 1899 this pioneering headmaster started building a new complex which still serves the school today at Steep, Petersfield, Hampshire. =Operation= Badley was a great educationalist, an able Classicist; tall handsome charismatic, leading through example and great personal authority. Integral to that persona though was the personal reserve and sexual repression characteristic of the English Public School system, coupled with the quaint and even cranky - to modern sensibilities at least - obsessions of 1890 Sandal Socialism and German Naturkultur: the emphasis on cold baths, earth closets, homespun fabrics, and \\"unsilly\\" (i.e. non-sexual) friendship between adolescent boys and girls. He was strict and he was obeyed; he neither smoked nor drank: \\"When he came stalking with his quick, silent tread, into the classroom there was immediate silence; if there happened to be a piece of paper on the floor, he would point to it without deigning to say a word, and the boy nearest would hurriedly pick it up.\\" He created a marvellous example of the evolving school. His educational outline, which he knew would fill out and develop as the years passed, became a framework to which he would continue to contribute and set outer limits, but then allowed the school to evolve. While he would be called \\"Chief\\" for the rest of his life by students and staff alike, he did not dominate as most great headmasters have. At the age of seventy he retired to Cholesbury, near Tring, after being headmaster of his school for forty-two years.Brandreth, Gyles and Sally Henry: John Haden Badley, 1865-1967: Bedales School and its Founder (1967) Bedales Society Cholesbury is some 2½ miles from Spencers Green where the Badleys' son (John Edmund Badley, known as Jock, b 3.10.94) and daughter in law had their farm.

It was formed from Christiana Hundred and New Castle Hundred in 1710 and was named for White Clay Creek that flows along its northern boundary. Originally, the default boundary of Delaware and Maryland was the vague height of land between the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay drainage basins and White Clay Creek Hundred extended to that point. With the running of the Mason–Dixon line in 1767, the western boundary of Delaware was established in its present location and became White Clay Creek Hundred’s western boundary. It was the gap between this line and the existing western boundary, the 12 mile arc drawn around the town of New Castle, which created the long-disputed area known as the Wedge. Development Except for some preserved woods along White Clay Creek, this area is now completely urban and suburban with continuous industrial, commercial and residential developments, much of it in the small city of Newark, the location of the University of Delaware.

Euphronios (; c. 535 – after 470 BC) was an ancient Greek vase painter and potter, active in Athens in the late 6th and early 5th centuries BC. As part of the so-called \\"Pioneer Group,\\" (a modern name given to a group of vase painters who were instrumental in effecting the change from Black-figure pottery to Red figure), Euphronios was one of the most important artists of the red-figure technique. His works place him at the transition from Late Archaic to Early Classical art, and he is one of the first known artists in history to have signed his work.  General considerations  = The discovery of Greek vase painters = In contrast to other artists, such as sculptors, no Ancient Greek literature sources refer specifically to vase painters. The copious literary tradition on the arts hardly mention pottery. Thus reconstruction of Euphronios's life and artistic development—like that of all Greek vase painters—can only be derived from his works. Modern scientific study of Greek pottery began near the end of the 18th century. Initially, interest focused on iconography. The discovery of the first signature of Euphronios in 1838 revealed that individual painters could be identified and named, so that their works might be ascribed to them. This led to an intensive study of painters' signatures, and by the late 19th century, scholars began to compile stylistic compendia. The archaeologist John D. Beazley used these compendia as a starting point for his own work. He systematically described and catalogued thousands of Attic black-figure and red-figure vases and sherds, using the methods of the art historian Giovanni Morelli for the study of paintings. In three key volumes on Attic painters, Beazley achieved a taxonomy that remains mostly valid to this day. He listed all known painters (named or unnamed) who produced individual works of art which can always be unmistakably ascribed. Today, most painters are identified, though their names often remain unknown. = The situation in Athens at the end of the 6th century BC = Euphronios must have been born around 535 BC, when Athenian art and culture bloomed during the tyranny of Peisistratos. Most Attic pottery was then painted in the black-figure style. Much of the Athenian pottery production of that time was exported to Etruria. Most of the extant Attic pottery has been recovered as grave goods (excavated or looted) from Etruscan tombs. At the time, vase painting received major new impulses from potters such as Nikosthenes and Andokides. The Andokides workshop began the production of red-figure pottery around 530 BC. Gradually, the new red-figure technique began to replace the older black-figure style. Euphronios was to become one of the most important representatives of early red-figure vase painting in Athens. Together with a few other contemporary young painters, modern scholarship counts him as part of the \\"Pioneer Group\\" of red-figure painting.  Apprenticeship in the workshop of Kachrylion  Euphronios appears to have started painting vases around 520 BC, probably under the tutelage of Psiax. Later, Euphronios himself was to have a major influence on the work of his erstwhile master, as well as on that of several other older painters. Later he worked in the workshop of the potter Kachrylion, under supervision of the painter Oltos. His works from this early phase already show several of Euphronios' artistic characteristics: his tendency to paint mythological scenes, his preference for monumental compositions, but also for scenes from everyday life, and his careful rendering of muscles and movement. The latter aspects particularly indicate a close link with Psiax, who painted in a similar style. Apart from a few fragments, a bowl in London (E 41) and one in Malibu (77.AE.20) can be ascribed to this phase of his work. The most important early vase, however, is a signed specimen depicting Sarpedon. It was only through the appearance of this vase on the international market that Euphronios' early works could be recognised and distinguished from the paintings of Oltos, who had previously been credited with some works by Euphronios. Although it later became common for painters to sign their best works, signatures were rarely used in black-figure and early red-figure painting. Paris, Louvre G 34: Bowl: A satyr pursues a maenad. Even Euphronios's earliest known works show a total control of the technical abilities necessary for red-figure vase painting. Similarly, a number of technical advances which were adopted as part of the standard red-figure technique can be first seen in his work. To render the depictions of human anatomy more plastic and realistic, he introduced the relief line and the use of diluted clay slip. Depending on how it is applied, the slip can acquire a range of colours between light yellow and dark brown during firing, thus multiplying the stylistic possibilities available to the artist. Euphronios's technical and artistic innovations were apparently quickly influential; pieces produced during his early period by other painters working for Kachrylion, and even by his former teachers Psiax and Oltos, show stylistic and technical aspects first seen in Euphronios's own work. Although Kachylion's workshop only produced drinking bowls, and Euphronios continued to work for him into his maturity, simple bowls soon failed to satisfy his artistic impulse. He began to paint other vase types, probably working with different potters. The Villa Giulia holds two very early pelikes by him. Such medium-size vases offered more space for his figural paintings. A psykter now in Boston is also counted among his early work, as it strongly resembles the work of Oltos: stiff garment folds, almond-shaped eyes, a small protruding chin and ill- differentiated hands and feet. Alternatively, it could be a relatively careless work from a later phase. Such problems in assigning Euphronios' works to the different periods of his activity recur for several of his vases. Although the general chronology and development of his work is well known, some of his works remain difficult to place precisely. For example, a chalice krater in the Antikensammlung Berlin, depicting young men exercising in the palaistra is often counted among his later works due to the vase shape. Nonetheless, it seems that in spite of the occurrence of some advanced methods (careful representation of musculature, the use of the relief line), the krater must be dated to an earlier phase, since it borrows some stylistic motifs from black-figure vase painting. These motifs include an ivy garland below the mouth, the fairly small image format and the stylistic similarity to the work of Oltos.  Euphronios and Euxitheos: Mature phase, years of mastery  = Innovation and competition = 250px Around 510 BC, probably seeking new media for his compositions, Euphronios entered the workshop of Euxitheos, a potter who was similarly engaged in experimenting with form and decor in his own work. The stylistic development of Euphronios's work during this period, during which both painter and potter attempted bold and influential experiments, permits a reconstruction of its chronological sequence with some certainty. A partially preserved chalice krater from this period (Louvre G 110) is indicative of the degree to which Euphronios was aware of the influence of his artistic innovations. The front of the chalice shows a classic scene that he had already painted on a bowl around 520 BC : the fight between Heracles and the Nemean Lion. The back, however, depicts a bold and innovative double composition : above, a komos scene, with the participants of the dance drawn in extreme physical postures, and below, a figure viewed from behind, arms leaning backwards. The striking scene has been thought to be the reason that Euphronios signed the work. The signature is unique, as the artist uses the formula Euphronios egraphsen tade - \\"Euphronios has painted these things\\". The piece is a characteristic example of the Pioneer Group's work and shows how a single vase could make an individual contribution to the development of the form. This drive for innovation led to a spirit of competition even within individual workshops. On an amphora in Munich, Euthymides, another Pioneer Group Painter, claims that he has painted a picture \\"as Euphronios never could have done\\". This phrase implies respect for the colleague's and rival's skill, as well as a contest with him. Similarly, a somewhat younger painter, Smikros, probably a pupil of Euphronios, created some very successful early works that directly plagiarised his master. The Getty Museum has a signed psykter by Smikros that depicts Euphronios wooing an ephebe named as Leagros. The name Leagros occurs frequently in kalos inscriptions by Euphronios. = Herakles, Antaios and Sarpedon – the two masterpieces = Louvre G 103: Heracles and Antaios on a chalice krater. A chalice krater with a depiction of Heracles and Antaios in combat is often considered one of Euphronios's masterpieces. The contrast between the barbarian Libyan giant Antaios and the civilised, well-groomed Greek hero is a striking reflection of the developing Greek self-image, and the anatomical precision of the struggling characters' bodies lends grace and power to the piece. The intensity of the work is increased by the presence of two female figures, whose statuesque appearance closes the image. During the restoration of the vase, an original outline sketch was found, showing that Euphronios initially had difficulties in depicting the dying giant's outstretched arm, but managed to overcome them while painting the scene. Front of the Sarpedon krater. The Sarpedon krater or Euphronios krater, created around 515 BC, is normally considered to be the apex of Euphronios' work. As on the well-known vase from his early phase, Euphronios sets Sarpedon at the centre of the composition. Following an order by Zeus, Thanatos and Hypnos carry Sarpedon's dead body from the battlefield. In the centre background is Hermes, here depicted in his role of accompanying the dead on their last voyage. The ensemble is flanked by two Trojan warriors staring straight ahead, apparently oblivious of the action that takes place between them. The figures are not only labelled with their names, but also with explanatory texts. The use of thin slip allowed Euphronios to deliberately use different shades of colour, rendering the scene especially lively. But the krater marks the peak of the artist's abilities not only in pictorial terms; the vase also represents a new achievement in the development of the red-figure style. The shape of the chalice krater had already been developed during the black-figure phase by the potter and painter Exekias, but Euxitheos's vase displays further innovations created specifically for the red-figure technique. By painting the handles, foot and lower body of the vase black, the space available for red-figure depictions is strictly limited. As is usual for Euphronios, the pictorial scene is framed by twisting curlicues. The painting itself is a classic example of the painter's work: strong, dynamic, detailed, anatomically accurate and with a strong hint of pathos. Both artists appear to have been aware of the quality of their work, as both painter and potter signed it. The krater is the only work by Euphronios to have survived in its entirety. The back of the Sarpedon krater shows a simple arming scene, executed more hastily as the massive krater's clay dried and rendered it less workable. This explicitly contemporary scene, depicting a group of anonymous youths arming themselves for war, is emblematic of the new realism in content as well as form which Euphronios brought to the red-figure technique. These scenes from everyday life, and the artistic conceit of pairing them with a mythological scene on the same piece, distinguish many of the pieces painted by Euphronios and those who followed him. In addition to its unique archaeological and artistic status, the Sarpedon krater played a pivotal role in the exposure and dismantling of a major antiquities smuggling network that traded in looted archaeological treasures and sold them on to major museums and collectors, including the Metropolitan Museum, the J. Paul Getty Museum in California, and Texan oil billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt. The krater was one of a number of grave goods that were illegally unearthed in late 1971 when a gang of tombaroli (tomb robbers) led by Italian antiquities dealer Giacomo Medici looted a previously-undiscovered Etruscan tomb complex near Cerveteri, Italy. Medici subsequently sold the krater to American dealer Robert E. Hecht, who in turn negotiated its sale for US$1 million to the Metropolitan Museum, New York City, where it went on display from 1972. Over the next thirty years, a series of press investigations and a lengthy and extensive trans-national criminal investigation led by Italian authorities eventually smashed the smuggling ring, resulting in numerous prosecutions (including Medici, Hecht and Getty Museum curator Marion True), and the return to Italy of scores of looted antiquities illegally obtained by the Metropolitan, the Getty and other institutions. After lengthy negotiations, the Euphronios krater was formally returned to Italian ownership in February 2006, but remained on display as a loan to the Metropolitan Museum until its highly publicised repatriation to Italy in January 2008.Vernon Silver, The Lost Chalice: The Epic Hunt for A Priceless Masterpiece (Harper Collins, 2009) = Scenes from everyday life = Berlin: Antikensammlung. Athletes preparing for a competition, circa 510-500 BC. Apart from mythological motifs, Euphronios also produced many pots incorporating scenes from everyday life. A chalice krater in the Staatliche Antikensammlungen at Munich depicts a symposium. Four men are lying on couches (klinai) and drinking wine. A hetaira, named \\"Syko\\" by the accompanying inscription, is playing the flute, while the host, named as Ekphantides, is chanting a song to honour Apollo. The words flood from his mouth in a composition resembling the speech bubbles of modern comics. Such scenes are relatively common. This is probably mostly because the vases were made to be used at comparable occasions, but perhaps also because painters like Euphronios belonged to the depicted circles of Athenian citizenry - or at least aspired to do so, as it is not clear to modern researchers what the social status of a vase painter was. A signed psykter at the Hermitage (St. Petersburg) is also very well known. It depicts four hetairai feasting. One of them is labelled with the name Smikra, probably a humorous allusion to the young painter Smikros. Apart from the feasting images, there are also some palaistra scenes, which permitted the artist to indulge his delight in movement, dynamics and musculature. One example is the only surviving piece by Euphronios in black-figure technique, fragments of which were found on the Athenian Acropolis. It was a Panathenaic amphora. Part of the head of Athena is recognisable. It is likely that the reverse, as was the norm for this vase shape, depicted an athletic competition in one of the sports that formed part of the Panathenaic Games.  Late phase  Arezzo: Museo archeologico statale Gaio Cilnio Mecenate. Unsigned volute krater, found in the 18th century near Arezzo. Euphronios's later works are partially beset by difficulties of attribution. In many cases, this is due to direct imitation or echoes of his own artistic style in the work of other painters working during his lifetime. Well known is an unsigned volute krater, found in the 18th century near Arezzo. The main scene on the belly of the vase can easily be attributed to Euphronios. The krater shows a combat scene, with Heracles and Telamon at the center, fighting amazons. Telamon delivers the deathblow to a wounded amazon in Scythian clothing. Heracles is fighting the amazon Teisipyle, who is aiming an arrow at him. This late work is another example of Euphronios's search for new forms of expression. The scene is characterized by an impressive dynamic, which seems to have taken control of the artist, as he painted Telamon's leg in a very twisted position. The small frieze of komastes around the neck of the vase is problematic in terms of attribution. It may be by one of the master's assistants, perhaps by Smikros. That particular krater appears to have been a central work, influencing and inspiring many others. For example, a neck amphora (Louvre G 107) shows a nearly identical scene, but in a style quite different from that of Euphronios. On it, Heracles is accompanied by a mysterious inscription: He appears to belong to Smikros. Perhaps it is a cooperation by both artists. A different situation applies to an amphora (Leningrad 610) that also shows a similar scene to the krater described above, but depicts Heracles as an archer. As the piece is similar to Euphronios's work not only in terms of motif but also of artistic style, Beazley hesitantly ascribed it to the master. The problem is that at this point, the style and skills of Smikros had grown very similar to those of his teacher, making it difficult to distinguish their works. Euphronios's final works (Louvre G 33, Louvre G 43) are characterised by strong simplification. The motifs are less carefully composed than earlier works, probably because Euphronios concentrated on a different occupation from 500 BC onwards.  Euphronios as potter  Euphronios seems to have taken over a pottery workshop around 500 BC. It is not unusual in the history of Greek pottery and vase painting for artists to be active in both fields; several other painters from the Pioneer Group, such as Phintias and Euthymides are also known to have been potters. Nonetheless, the situation of Euphronios is unique insofar that he was initially active exclusively as a painter and later only as a potter. Onesimos.thumb In the following years, the Euphronios workshop mainly produced bowls. It is understandable that he should have made such a choice, as the potters (kerameis) probably were independent entrepreneurs, whereas the painters were employees. Thus, a potter had a higher chance to reach affluence. Some other hypotheses have been suggested, e.g. that Euphronios developed a true passion for the potter's craft. This is quite possible, as he turned out to be a highly skilled potter; in fact, his signature as potter survives on more vases than that as a painter. A further theory proposes that a deterioration of eyesight forced him to concentrate on a different activity. This view may be supported by the discovery of the base of a votive offering on the Acropolis. A fragmentary inscription contains the name Euphronios and the word hygieia (health). In modern scholarships, material considerations are, however, more generally accepted as relevant. It is interesting that he chose bowls as the main product of his workshop. Heretofore, bowls had usually been painted by less skilled painters, and were probably in lower regards than other vases. His choice of painters indicates that he placed major emphasis on employing first class talents, such as Onesimos, Douris, the Antiphon Painter, the Triptolemos Painter and the Pistoxenos Painter, in his workshop.

He is a two-time Grey Cup champion, having won in 2004 with the Toronto Argonauts and in 2011 with the Lions. He has played 10 seasons in the CFL with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Toronto Argonauts, Hamilton Tiger-Cats and BC Lions. During the 2011 season, he became the 14th CFL receiver to record over 10,000 yards receiving in a career. High school career Bruce attended Olathe North High School in Olathe, Kansas, and was a letterman in football. As a senior, he was a BlueChip Illustrated Top-100 pick, the Kansas State Player of the Year, and finished the year with 1,696 rushing yards. Bruce finished his high school career with more than 3,000 rushing yards and 50 touchdowns. Junior college career Bruce then attended Hutchinson Community College in Hutchinson, Kansas. As a freshman, he was named a First-Team All-American selection and rushed for over 1,000 yards. During his sophomore season, he ran for 997 yards and 10 touchdowns and was named a Second-Team All-American selection. NCAA Division I-A career Bruce played college football for the University of Minnesota. As a senior, he helped lead his team to an 8-3 record and a Sun Bowl berth. Professional career =Kansas City Chiefs= On April 19, 2000, Bruce was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs only to be cut by the team later on. =Winnipeg Blue Bombers= On May 1, 2001, Bruce joined the CFL's Winnipeg Blue Bombers where he got his first opportunity as a professional to receive significant playing time, playing in all 18 regular season games. In his rookie season, Bruce had 818 receiving yards with 7 touchdowns. His team went on to play in the Grey Cup championship, only to lose to the Calgary Stampeders. In 2002, Bruce surpassed the 1000 yard receiving mark by amassing 1062 receiving yards with 12 touchdowns in 17 games. =San Francisco 49ers= In 2003, Bruce returned to the U.S. to try his luck once more with the NFL. On March 3 of that year, he signed with the San Francisco 49ers where he spent much of his playing time on special teams. =Toronto Argonauts= In 2004, after being released by the 49ers following their training camp, Bruce returned to the CFL with the Toronto Argonauts, signing with them on September 3, more than halfway through the CFL season and just shortly before their Labour Day Classic game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in which he played. For the remaining seven games in the regular season, Bruce had 247 receiving yards with just one touchdown. In addition to playing receiver, Bruce also served as one of two kick returners on the team alongside incumbent Bashir Levingston. In that role, Bruce returned two kick returns for touchdowns that season. In the East Division final, Bruce led all receivers with 12 receptions for 101 yards, and returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, helping the Argonauts advance to the Grey Cup championship that year. In the big game, the kick returning threat of both Bruce & Levingston induced the opposing BC Lions to punt the ball out of bounds for much of the game to neutralize the threat. In addition, Bruce was once again a go to receiver amassing 79 yards on 5 receptions. Bruce and the Argos went on to win the Grey Cup. right In 2005, Bruce established himself as the Argonauts top receiver with 1205 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns. In that same year, Bruce was named an East division all-star marking the first time in his CFL career he had ever been named to an all-star team. In 2008, after acquiring a touchdown against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Bruce was fined an undisclosed amount by the CFL for donning a Spider-Man mask during his touchdown celebration. In 2009, he received two objectionable conduct penalties and an undisclosed fine from the CFL for a touchdown celebration against the Tiger-Cats on July 1, in which he removed his helmet, jersey, and shoulder pads, and laid down in the end zone in what he said was a tribute to the recently deceased pop star, Michael Jackson. The Argonauts publicly supported the fine and disciplined Bruce additionally and he apologized to teammates at a team meeting the following day. Head coach Bart Andrus took some responsibility on himself, however, noting that, \\"I made the mistake of telling him in camp that once he got to the end zone I didn't care what he did but he's straight with it now and I think next time around he will celebrate in an appropriate manner.\\" =Hamilton Tiger-Cats= On July 29, 2009, Bruce was traded to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in exchange for the rights to Corey Mace, a third round pick in the 2010 CFL Draft, and a conditional third round pick in the 2011 CFL Draft a week after a dispute with coach Andrus became public and Bruce was left home for the Week 4 game in Winnipeg. In July 2011, Bruce declared his intention to change his name to \\"Runako Reth\\". =BC Lions= On August 3, 2011, Bruce was traded to the BC Lions in exchange for a third-round draft pick in the 2012 CFL Draft and an additional conditional draft pick in the 2013 CFL Draft.https://www.cfl.ca/article/ticats-trade-receiver-bruce-to-lions Ticats trade receiver Bruce to Lions Bruce had a productive season with the Lions, recording 49 catches for 755 yards and eight touchdowns in 12 games. In the 99th Grey Cup game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, he had 73 yards receiving and a touchdown and won his second championship. During the following off-season, he signed a contract extension with the Lions. On January 18, 2013, Bruce was released by the BC Lions. =Montreal Alouettes= On January 21, 2013, Bruce signed with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. Arland Bruce had a respectable 2013 season with the Alouettes. He contributed 64 pass receptions, his most since 2010, for 851 yards with 5 touchdowns. In February 2014, Bruce was fined an undisclosed amount by the CFL following his Instagram post in which he told openly gay NFL prospect Michael Sam to, \\"get on his knees and submit to God fully\\".Arland Bruce, Bryant Turner Jr. fined for anti-gay remarks Bruce was released by the Alouettes in late February. Bruce's high salary along with the belief that new head coach Tom Higgins would start two Canadian wide receivers were cited as the reasons for his dismissal.

It was centred in Tonga on the island of Tongatapu, with its capital at Mua. Modern researchers and cultural experts attest to widespread Tongan influence, evidence of transoceanic trade and exchange of material and non-material cultural artefacts. History =Beginning of Tongan expansionism= With the decline of Samoa's Tui Manu'a maritime empire, a new empire rose from the South. In 950 AD, the first Tu'i Tonga 'Aho'eitu started to expand his rule outside of Tonga. According to leading Tongan scholars, including Dr. 'Okusitino Mahina, the Tongan and Samoan oral traditions indicate that the first Tu'i Tonga was the son of their god Tangaloa.see writings of Ata of Kolovai in \\"O Tama a Aiga\\" by Morgan Tuimaleali'ifano; writings by Mahina, also coronation edition of Spasifik Magazine, \\"The Pacific Islands: An Encyclopedia,\\" edited by Lal and Fortune, p. 133etc. As the ancestral homeland of the Tu'i Tonga dynasty and the abode of deities such as Tagaloa 'Eitumatupu'a, Tonga Fusifonua, and Tavatavaimanuka, the Manu'a islands of Samoa were considered sacred by the early Tongan kings.\\"The Pacific Islands: An Encyclopedia,\\" edited by Lal and Fortune, p. 133 By the time of the 10th Tu’i Tonga Momo, and his successor, Tuʻitātui, the Tu'i Tonga's empire had grown to include much of the former domains of the Tui Fiti and Tui Manu'a, with the Manu'a group as the only exception. To better govern the large territory, the Tu’i Tonga had their throne moved by the lagoon at Lapaha, Tongatapu. The influence of the Tu’i Tonga was renowned throughout the Pacific, and many of the neighbouring islands participated in the widespread trade of resources and new ideas. =Expansion (1200–1500)= Under the 10th Tui Tonga, Momo and his son Tuitātui (11th Tui Tonga) the empire was at its height of expansion, tributes for the Tu'i Tonga were said to be exacted from all tributary chiefdoms of the empire. This tribute was known as the \\" 'Inasi \\" and was conducted annually at Mu'a following the harvest season when all countries that were subject to the Tu'i Tonga must bring a gift for the gods, who was recognized as the Tu'i Tonga. Captain Cook witnessed an Inasi ceremony in 1777, in which he noticed a lot of foreigners in Tonga, especially the darker people from Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu . The finest mats of Samoa ('ie tōga) are incorrectly translated as \\"Tongan mats;\\" the correct meaning is \\"treasured cloth\\" (\\"ie\\" = cloth, \\"tōga\\" = female goods, in opposition to \\"oloa\\" = male goods).the Tongan linguistic analogue is \\"to'onga,\\" see http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=535267&coltype;=pacific%20cultures&regno;=fe011574 Many fine mats came into the possession of the Tongan royal families through chiefly marriages with Samoan noblewomen, such as Tohu'ia, the mother of the first Tu'i Kanokupolu, Ngata, who came from Safata, 'Upolu, Samoa.

The most common vessels were long-distance double-canoes fitted with triangular sails. The largest canoes of the Tongan kalia type could carry up to 100 men. The most notable of these were the Tongafuesia, Ākiheuho, the Lomipeau, and the Takaipōmana. It should be mentioned that the Takaipōmana was actually a Samoan kalia; according to Queen Sālote and the Palace Records this was the Samoan double-hulled canoe that brought Tohu'ia Limapō from Sāmoa to wed the Tu'i Ha'atakalaua. The large navy allowed for Tonga to become wealthy with large amounts of trade and tribute flowing into the Royal Treasury. =Decline of Tui Tonga and two new dynasties= The Tui Tonga decline began due to numerous wars and internal pressure. In the 13th or 14th century, the Samoans had expelled the Tongans from their lands after Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki was defeated in battle by the brothers Tuna, Fata and Savea, progenitors of the Malietoa family. In response, the falefā was created as political advisors to the Empire. The falefā officials were initially successful in maintaining some hegemony over other subjected islands but increased dissatisfaction led to the assassination of several rulers in succession. The most notable were, Havea I (19th TT), Havea II (22nd TT), and Takalaua (23rd TT), who were all known for their tyrannical rule. In AD 1535, Takalaua was assassinated by two foreigners while swimming in the lagoon of Mu'a. His successor, Kauulufonua I pursued the killers all the way to Uvea, where he killed them. Because of so many assassination attempts on the Tu'i Tonga, Kauulufonua established a new dynasty called the Ha'a Takalaua in honour of his father and gave his brother, Mo’ungamotu’a, the title of Tu’i Ha’atakalaua. This new dynasty was to deal with the everyday decisions of the empire, while the position of Tu’i Tonga was to be the nation's spiritual leader, though he still controlled the final say in the life or death of his people. The Tu'i Tonga \\"empire\\" at this period becomes Samoan in orientation as the Tu'i Tonga kings themselves became ethnic Samoans who married Samoan women and resided in Samoa.\\"The Pacific Islands: An Encyclopedia,\\" edited by Lal and Fortune, p. 133; ; \\"Tongan Society,\\" Edward Gifford; \\"Tongan Society at the Time of Captain Cook's Visits,\\" Queen Salote, Bott and Tavi Kau'ulufonua's mother was a Samoan from Manu'a,; also \\"Deconstructing the Island Group,\\" Australian National University Tu'i Tonga Kau'ulufonua II and Tu'i Tonga Puipuifatu had Samoan mothers and as they married Samoan women the succeeding Tu'i Tonga - Vakafuhu, Tapu'osi, and 'Uluakimata - were allegedly more \\"Samoan\\" than \\"Tongan.\\"; \\"Tongan Society,\\" Edward Gifford; \\"Tongan Society at the Time of Captain Cook's Visits,\\" Queen Salote, Bott and Tavi In 1610, the 6th Tu’i Ha’a Takalaua, Mo'ungatonga, created the position of Tu’i Kanokupolu for his half-Samoan son, Ngata, which divided regional rule between them, though as time went on the Tu’i Kanokupolu's power became more and more dominant over Tonga. The Tu'i Kanokupolu dynasty oversaw the importation and institution of many Samoan policies and titles and according to Tongan scholars, this \\"Samoanized\\" form of government and custom continues today in the modern Kingdom of Tonga see History of Tonga; 'Okusitino Mahina 2004; and journal articles Things continued this way for a long time afterward. The first Europeans arrived in 1616, when the Dutch explorers Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire spotted Tongans in a canoe off the coast of Niuatoputapu, and the famous Abel Tasman followed soon after. These visits were brief, however, and did not change the island much at all. The dividing line between the two moieties was the old coastal road named Hala Fonua moa (dry land road). Still today the chiefs who derive their authority from the Tui Tonga are named the Kau Hala Uta (inland road people) while those from the Tui Kanokupolu are known as the Kau Hala Lalo (low road people). Concerning the Tui Haatakalaua supporters: when this division arose, in the 15th century, they were of course the Kauhalalalo. But when the Tui Kanokupolu had overtaken them they shifted their allegiance to the Kauhalauta.

It is one of the series of small towns stretched along the Main Western railway line and Great Western Highway that bisects the Blue Mountains National Park. Leura is situated adjacent to Katoomba, the largest centre in the upper mountains, and the two towns merge along Leura's western edge.Blue Mountains Tourist Map, Eighth Edition, 1988, New South Wales Government History The original inhabitants of the area were the Dharug people. Archaeological evidence at Lyrebird Dell in South Leura suggests that Aboriginal occupation of the region may date back more than 12,000 years. The first Europeans to enter the area, in 1813, was the expedition of Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Charles Wentworth. They were followed by the expedition of George Evans in November 1813 and the road-building party of William Cox in the following year. When the western railway line was constructed across the Blue Mountains in 1867–68, a gatehouse (No 9) was erected where the line crossed the Western Road near the present Sorensen Bridge. The gatekeepers were the first permanent European residents of the area, Another early presence occurred following the discovery of coal in the Jamison Valley below the present Leura golf course in the early 1880s, which led to the establishment of a colliery. The earliest appearance of the name Leura was on a plan of subdivision, dated January–March 1881, for land south of the railway line belonging to Frederick Clissold. On his plan Clissold named a distinctive waterfall Leura Falls. Many theories have been advanced as to the origins of the name of Leura, but the debate has by no means been settled. When the land was offered for sale later in 1881 as the Leura Estate, however, the name was well on its way to general acceptance. Perhaps the first large home erected at Leura was Leura House, high on the northern side of the Western Road, in the late 1880s. Another early house was Mondeval in Railway Parade which was built in the 1890s. A railway platform was erected in 1891, followed on Christmas Eve 1892 by the opening of the Leura Coffee Palace. Postal facilities were established in 1893 and during the next 20 years land on both sides of the railway line was subdivided and offered for sale. A new railway station was built in 1902. While the early focus of activity had been along the Western Road, with the construction of the Coffee Palace and the railway station, Leura Mall began to dominate. Most of its commercial buildings date from 1900 to the 1920s and today the Mall is the focus of Leura's daily business activity. 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/ license.  Heritage listings  Leura has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Blue Mountains National Park: Blue Mountains walking tracks * 37 - 49 Everglades Avenue: Everglades, Leura Population At the 2016 census, there were 4,644 people in Leura. 66.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 6.5%. 81.7% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 39.8%, Anglican 15.7% and Catholic 14.0%. Description Leura's elevation of leads to occasional snowfall in winter and a climate that reflects all four seasons distinctly. The village centre lies on Leura Mall which is divided at this point by a wide grassy median strip planted with flowering cherry trees. The historic streetscape has been largely preserved, although there was local concern regarding the development of a shopping complex on the site of a former distribution warehouse. Redesigned to better suit the Leura Mall ambience after consultations with the wider community, the new shopping complex is now complete, hosting a Woolworths supermarket and liquor store. The historic post office building is now home to a news agency. The Alexandra Hotel, not far from the railway station, offers panoramic views from its back veranda. There are a substantial number of restaurants, cafes and coffee shops along Leura Mall, among the boutiques, gift and antique shops. Leura is home to many formal, English-style, cool-climate gardens, which provide elegant walks and the opportunity to visit when open to the public in early October each year. In 2016, Leura was named in the list of top 50 most irresistible, exotic, historic and postcard-worthy small towns in Australia. Activities A small waterfall at the left One of the most prominent of Leura's historic homes is Leuralla, the former home of Clive Evatt, an Australian politician, barrister and raconteur. Evatt was the brother of H.V. \\"Doc\\" Evatt, a former Chief Justice of New South Wales, Leader of the Australian Labor Party, the third President of the United Nations General Assembly, the first Chairman of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, and a Justice of the High Court of Australia, and Leuralla contains a memorial to Doc Evatt. The Evatt family still owns and manages the property which is now home to the NSW Toy and Railway Museum. Another major attraction is the Everglades Gardens, the former home of Belgian-born industrialist Henri van de Velde now administered by the National Trust. The Everglades includes van de Velde's Moderne-style home and 5 hectares (13 acres) of landscaped gardens designed by Danish-born landscape gardener Paul Sorensen.Everglades Gardens Visit Blue Mountains The Everglades has an outdoor theatre which often hosts productions such as Cirquinox and the Leura Shakespeare festival. Self-styled as \\"the Garden Village\\", the Leura Gardens Festival is held annually in October. The Festival is a registered charity and raises money for the Blue Mountains District ANZAC Memorial Hospital in Katoomba by opening private gardens to the public. Not connected with the garden festival but also held at the same time is the popular Leura Village Fair. Natural attractions include Sublime Point to the south, which offers panoramic views of the Jamison Valley, and Leura Cascades in the southwest. There is a network of tracks that goes from Links Road to Echo Point, taking in many attractions along the way, including the Pool of Siloam, Leura Cascades, Leura Falls, Jamison Lookout, Linda Falls and the Dardanelles Pass, before ascending to Echo Point via the Giant Stairway. The area is popular for bushwalking and photography.

It is intended to give serving and discharged Israeli personnel and reservists a means to confidentially recount their experiences in the Occupied Territories. Collections of such accounts have been published in order to educate the Israeli public about conditions in these areas. The organization's stated mission is to 'break the silence' surrounding these military activities.Erella Grassiani, \\"The Phenomenon of Breaking the Silence in Israel: 'Witnessing' as Consciousness-Raising Strategy of Ex-Combatants,\\" in Th.

Founded to collect testimony from 2000 to 2004 from troops who served in the Occupied Territories, the NGO has continued to operate. It has collected and published accounts related to succeeding operations in Gaza and other areas since that time. The NGO has been criticized for publishing anonymous accounts. A 2016 investigation by a television program confirmed the integrity of the organization, but also said that a few of the testimonies painted a distorted picture. In court challenges to reveal its sources, BtS has won rulings to protect their confidentiality. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some other senior political figures have repeatedly criticised the organization., Haaretz His government tried to dissuade other governments from providing any funding to it. Netanyahu strongly criticised BtS in a speech to the Knesset in early 2015, and late in the year, the Education Minister proposed a bill blocking its speakers from state schools. At the same time, some senior figures in the Israeli defense and security establishment have defended the NGO. For instance, General Amiram Levin said in 2015 that \\"Breaking the Silence strengthens the IDF and its morality.\\"Isabel Kershner, 'Israeli Veterans’ Criticism of West Bank Occupation Incites Furor', The New York Times, 23 December 2015. History Among the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) units serving during the Second Intifada in the early 2000s, there was one in particular, battalion 50 of the Nahal, that in that period consisted of many youths from moshavim and kibbutzim,Erella Grassiani, Morality and Normalcy in A-Symmetrical Conflict: Distancing, Denial and Moral Numbing among Israeli Conscripts in Everyday Practices of Occupation, Vrije Universitet 2009 p.69 n.38.Erella Grassiani, ‘The Phenomenon of Breaking the Silence in Israel: ‘Witnessing’ as Consciousness Raising Strategy of Israeli Ex-Combatants,’ in Th.

They are mostly Ashkenazi Jews who are situated in the social economic middle-class of society (the Israeli Jewish elite) and are often members of moshavim and kibbutzim.' who had often known each other before their service. Grassiani believed their background was one in which there was more open talk about a two-state solution and perhaps more sympathy for the civilians they encountered. Members of battalion 50 were assigned to serve in the city of Hebron, which is important to all the Abrahamic religions. This second-largest city in the Occupied Territories had 160,000 Palestinians; it also had 500 Jewish settlers who occupied houses in the city center. Some 500 soldiers were stationed there to protect the settlers, resulting in frequent and close encounters with Palestinian civilians. Some of the soldiers were disturbed by what took place. Following their service, three reservists collected photographs and made a videotape of testimonies by other IDF soldiers who had also served in Hebron, to show what occurred in encounters between Palestinian civilians and the military. In June 2004 in Tel Aviv, Yehuda Shaul, and two other former soldiers, Jonathan Boimfeld and Micha Kurtz, organized an exhibit called Breaking the Silence, which featured photos and videotapes that \\"documented their compulsory service in Hebron.\\"Jonathan Lis, \\"IDF questions reservists who organized Hebron photo exhibit\\", Haaretz, 22 June 2004;accessed 18 November 2017 They wanted to educate the general Israeli population about what went on in military efforts to control Arab populations of the Occupied Territories. The exhibition was attended by thousands of people and received some international coverage. Afterward, the organizers were questioned by IDF personnel seeking to substantiate apparent abuses by those veterans. That same year, Shaul, Avichai Sharon, and Noam Chayut (the latter two also members of battalion 50 who had served in Hebron), founded Breaking the Silence (BtS), a non-governmental organization (NGO). They set up a website, www.shovrimshtika.org, and advertised that they would confidentially collect and record testimonies by veterans of their military experiences in the Occupied Territories since the start of the Second Intifada (2000). They also volunteered to speak to youth groups, schools and community groups about their experiences. They traveled all across Israel to collect such accounts. The NGO attracted hundred of members in its first year. For more than a decade, Breaking the Silence has published booklets and books that are collections of soldiers' accounts in order to educate the public about the reality of military operations by Israeli soldiers in the territories. These publications are listed below and in the External Links section, with information for downloading the texts. BtS also posts written and videotaped reports on its official website. In addition, members have conducted speaking tours throughout Israel, Western Europe, and the United States. =Officials= Shaul, who had completed two tours of duty in Hebron, served as the first executive director of BtS. In 2007 he became its foreign relations director, as the organization began to seek outside support for funding for its programs, in addition to providing direct aid to refusenik members and their families. It began to gain support from some church groups in various countries, primarily in Europe, as well as some direct support from some European governments and international groups. In 2007 Mikhael Manekin became executive director of BtS. In 2012 Dana Golan was serving in this post. According to the organization's website in 2017, the current executive director is Avner Gvaryahu. =Funding sources and issues= Breaking the Silence is funded through grants, including some from sources in Europe. In 2007, the NGO received a total of NIS 500,000. In 2008, it raised NIS 1.5 million, in 2009, around €275,000, and in 2014, NIS 3.8 million. According to the NGO Monitor website, between 2010 and 2014, foreign sources accounted for 65% of the group's funding. Breaking the Silence published its financial statements as of December 31, 2014, listing major donors who contributed more than 20,000 NIS that year. This included funding from the New Israel Fund, amounting to NIS 229,949, and funding from foreign governments. Breaking the Silence representatives who traveled to the United States to speak on college campuses and to Jewish communities were sponsored in 2007 by Jewish and Palestinian organizations. In 2008, BtS told The Jerusalem Post that the British Embassy in Tel Aviv gave the organization NIS 226,589 (c €40,000); the Dutch Embassy donated €19,999; and the European Union gave €43,514. In addition, during 2008, Spain is reported to have provided tens of thousands of euros to fund patrols run by Breaking the Silence in the city of Hebron. The Women Soldiers' Testimonies report, published in January 2010, was funded by The Moriah Foundation, the New Israel Fund, ICCO, SIVMO, Oxfam GB, the British Embassy in Tel Aviv, the EU, and the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation. In 2010, according to Moshe Dann, writing in The Jerusalem Post, Breaking the Silence's budget was NIS 3.1 million. It received a total of 1.5 million from the EU, and the UK and Spanish governments. The rest came from Oxfam, the New Israel Fund; Dutch, German, Danish and Irish church organizations; and NDC, the Palestinian NGO that promotes Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns. In 2014, the NGO received the majority of its funding from foreign governments.These are the NGOs who receive most of their funding from foreign countries (Hebrew), YNET, 2 June 2016 Relation to other activism Other Israelis and Palestinians have also been concerned about the conduct of Israeli soldiers in the Occupied Territories. A case reached the Israeli Supreme Court that challenged the IDF policy known as the \\"neighbor procedure.\\" This is the term for Israeli soldiers' using Palestinian civilians as human shields in order to protect soldiers during their operations from suspected booby traps or attacks by Palestinian militants. The Israeli Supreme Court in 2005 prohibited the \\"neighbour policy\\", saying that Israeli troops could not use Palestinians as shields.\\"Breaking silence on Gaza abuses\\", BBC News, 15 July 2009; accessed 28 September 2016 In May 2011, 24 former IDF soldiers provided testimony describing continued military use of the \\"neighbor procedure.\\" As reported by The Guardian, veterans through BtS also described daily harassment of Palestinians at military checkpoints and the deliberate ransacking of their homes. Activities =Anonymous soldier testimonies= Since 2004, Breaking the Silence has run a testimonies collection project called \\"Soldiers Speak Out.\\" By 2009 they had collected several hundred testimonies, many of them anonymous, from \\"those who have, during their service in the IDF, the Border Guard, and the Security Forces, played a role in the Occupied Territories.\\" Breaking the Silence says that confidentiality is necessary because the IDF allegedly prohibits service personnel from speaking publicly about their activities. As is typical of many large organizations, only official military spokesmen are allowed to speak to the media. Breaking the Silence officials say that they can provide personal details of soldiers to official and independent investigations, on the condition that the identities of soldiers are not made public. In April 2008, BtS released a report about the state of affairs in the West Bank city of Hebron. It included 39 eyewitness accounts by Israeli soldiers who had served there. The report generated widespread controversy and public debates in Israel about the implications of its ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories. Publication of additional collections since then has generated additional controversy and renewed discussions after each event. =Hebron tours= thumb BtS tour of Hebron, August 2015 Since 2005, BtS has been conducting tours to Hebron for members of the Israeli public and foreign visitors.Edward Platt,City of Abraham: History, Myth and Memory: A Journey through Hebron, Pan Macmillan, 2012, p.259. BtS wants the Israeli public to witness the realities in the Occupied Territories. In August 2008, the Israeli police cancelled the tours temporarily because a group of United Kingdom diplomats were harassed by Jewish settlers. The settlers taunted tour members and threw stones and eggs at them. That year, Commander Avshalom Peled, the head of the Israel Police's Hebron district, criticized both Breaking the Silence and Bnei Avraham, another group in Hebron. He said, \\"The left-wing organizations have become an even greater threat than the anarchists.\\" In June 2008, Peled said that he believed that BtS provoked settlers in the hope of producing a violent response for public reaction. Bnei Avraham says that it is \\"committed to 'disturbing the occupation, disrupting the segregation and apartheid regime'.\\" Police said that BtS and Bnei Avraham had held an illegal rally during a Hebron tour on 25 April 2008. MK Zehava Gal-On (Meretz) responded to Ynet reporting of police statements in Hebron, saying, \\"It would seem as though the police are working for the Kahanist and fascist groups in Hebron. I call on the internal security minister to conduct an investigation into the conduct of police forces in Hebron.\\" In his 2014 book Jewish State, Pariah Nation, American journalist Jerold Auerbach, who has been described as a proponent of right-wing Zionism, reported that some former soldiers expressed antipathy to the Jewish settlers in the West Bank.Jerold S. Auerbach, Jewish State, Pariah Nation: Israel and the Dilemmas of Legitimacy, Quid Pro Books, 2014 =Lectures and forums= BtS sponsors exhibits and lectures in Israel and abroad about military activities in the Occupied Territories, where Israel has had a presence for 50 years. Its representatives are available to speak in community centers and schools. For example, in April 2017, BtS held a panel discussion at the Barbur gallery in Jerusalem, featuring two former chiefs of Israel’s Shin Bet internal security agency, a retired senior police commander, and a respected law professor, who spoke about \\"the corrosive effect of 50 years of occupation on Israel’s security forces and citizens.\\" Ami Ayalon, one of the former Shin Bet chiefs, was \\"also a commander in chief of the Israeli Navy and is a recipient of Israel’s highest military decoration, the Medal of Valor.\\"IAN FISHER, \\"Israeli Leader Cancels Meeting After German Official Visits Protest Group\\", The New York Times, 25 April 2017; accessed 19 November 2017 The speakers also said they wanted to defend free speech. Outside the gallery, protesters called the panel members \\"traitors.\\" Prime Minister Netanyahu cancelled a scheduled high-level visit the week of April 25, 2017 with German minister of foreign affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, after he had met with Breaking the Silence representatives while in Israel. BtS publications =Soldiers' Testimonies from Operation Cast Lead, Gaza 2009= A booklet, Soldiers' Testimonies from Operation Cast Lead, Gaza 2009.Soldiers' Testimonies from Operation Cast Lead, Gaza 2009, Breaking the Silence, 14 July 2009 was compiled from accounts by about 30 reserve and regular combat soldiers from various units that participated in the fighting. Some 54 incidents were described of \\"firing of phosphorus gas in the direction of populated areas, the killing of innocent victims [using] small arms, destruction of hundreds of houses and mosques for no military purpose.\\" Soldiers also described using Palestinian civilians as human shields. The BBC said, \\"If true, that was a clear breach of the international laws of war—which say soldiers have a duty of care to non-combatants—and of Israeli law.\\" The human shield tactic had been specifically prohibited since 2005 by an Israeli Supreme Court ruling. The accounts said that commanders ordered soldiers to prevent harm to Israeli soldiers by any means necessary. Brigade, battalion, and company commanders conducted morale-building talks that resulted in soldiers having \\"zero patience for the life of enemy civilians.\\" These soldiers' testimonies exposed gaps between the official policies of the Israeli military and events on the ground. The IDF dismissed this BtS report. A military spokeswoman said that it was \\"investigating many of the requests from NGOs and other groups, but when you have a report that is based on hearsay, with no facts whatsoever, we can't do anything with it.\\" The IDF said that past investigations of allegations had found them to be second- or third-hand accounts, rather than the witnesses' own experiences. A Breaking the Silence spokesman said that the NGO verified its information by cross- referencing the testimonies, and confirming accounts from more than one source before publication. Journalist Amos Harel wrote \\"while there is no definite way of vouching for the credibility of their reports, it is safe to say that [the testifiers] did fight in Gaza and that they provided enough authentic detail to prove that they are not imposters.\\" Harel also wrote, \\"On the flip side, Breaking the Silence ... has a clear political agenda, and can no longer be classified as a 'human rights organization'. ... The organization has a clear agenda: to expose the consequences of IDF troops serving in the West Bank and Gaza. ... But this does not mean that the documented evidence, some of which was videotaped, is fabricated.\\" =Women Soldiers' Testimonies= In January 2010, Breaking the Silence published a booklet titled Women Soldiers' Testimonies that contained 96 anonymous accounts from more than 40 women officers, commanders and soldiers in various units who had served as combatants and in supporting combat roles in the Israeli-occupied territories since 2000. The booklet lists the rank, unit, and location of the soldiers who provided the testimonies. Ynetnews published excerpts from the report, summarizing them as showing the military's \\"systematic humiliation of Palestinians, reckless and cruel violence, theft, killing of innocent people and cover-up.\\" In response, an IDF representative said, \\"These are anonymous testimonies, without any mention of a time or a place, and their reliability cannot be examined in any way. The IDF is a controlled state organization, which learns and draws lessons, and cooperates with any serious body with the shared goal of exhausting any inquiry when such an examination is inquired.\\" =Occupation of the Territories: Israeli Soldier Testimonies 2000–2010= Occupation of the Territories: Israeli Soldier Testimonies 2000–2010, published in 2011, contains first-hand accounts by more than 100 Israeli soldiers. It was published in the United States as Our Harsh Logic: Israeli Soldiers' Testimonies from the Occupied Territories, 2000–2010. David Shulman, Professor of Humanistic Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, described the book in The New York Review of Books as \\"one of the most important published on Israel/Palestine in this generation.\\" Elliott Abrams, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State and senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote that the report contained many accounts of experiences during the Second Intifada. He wrote that the Israel Defense Forces were trying to stop numerous terrorist acts and suicide bombings that were \\"maiming and killing thousands\\" of Israeli civilians and criticized the book for failing to describe those dangers. He wrote that \\"the book's description of a West Bank living in deliberately inflicted misery does not comport with reality.\\" =This Is How We Fought in Gaza= This is How We Fought in Gaza: Soldiers' testimonies and photographs from Operation 'Protective Edge' -(2014) is a collection of soldiers' testimonies and photographs related to Operation Protective Edge conducted in Gaza.\\"This is How We Fought in Gaza\\", 2014, Breaking the Silence\\"In their own words: Israeli troops break ranks on Gaza Campaign\\", The Guardian, 04 May 2015, includes link to report This is How We Fought in Gaza The Guardian said that the testimonies \\"raised serious questions over whether Israel’s tactics breached its obligations under international law to distinguish and protect civilians.\\" Some 2200 Palestinians were killed during the war, including women and children.Peter Beaumont, \\"Israeli soldiers cast doubt on legality of Gaza military operation\\", The Guardian, 04 May 2015; accessed 20 November 2017  Criticism  In December 2015, journalist Haggai Matar summarized complaints by government sources and groups opposed to the activities of Breaking the Silence: *(1) it lacks credibility; *(2) it fails to provide the IDF with the evidence it collects; *(3) the published testimonies are anonymous; *(4) it receives donations from foreign countries; and *(5) it operates overseas. She demonstrated that the organization has established its credibility.Haggai Matar,\\"Why do so many Israelis hate Breaking the Silence?\\", +972 magazine, 14 December 2015. Reaction of government The Israeli political establishment has been hostile to the activities of the organization since it was founded in 2004. It believes that BtS emphasizes negative aspects of Israeli military operations and threatens its state security, \\"part of an advocacy campaign intended to harm Israel’s image overseas.\\" But in 2009, at a government- sponsored training program, other veterans not connected to BtS also spoke out about abuses by the military in the Occupied Territories. In early 2009, some veterans took part in a discussion at the Rabin Pre-Military Academy, at Oranim Academic College, revealing Israeli abuses during the Gaza War. Three said that civilians were shot and killed. When this material was reported, a furor arose in Israel, and the controversy was covered internationally.Ethan Bronner, \\"Soldiers' Accounts of Gaza Killings Raise Furor in Israel\\", The New York Times, 19 March 2009; Amy Teibel, Associated Press, \\"Israel to probe reported abuse by soldiers in Gaza\\", The Statesman ; \\"Israeli troops describe shooting Gaza civilians\\", The Guardian, 20 March 2009; ; John Lyons, \\"Israel looks at accounts of Gaza killings\\" , The Australian, 21 March 2009 Previously the Israeli government had dismissed as propaganda Palestinian assertions that Israeli forces had used indiscriminate and disproportionate firepower in civilian areas during the ground assault. But IDF veterans' accounts at this post-operation discussion confirmed at least some of those allegations.  * The IDF quickly conducted an inquiry into these accounts. On March 31, 2009, the Military Advocate General said that these soldiers' accounts that the IDF had been ordered to shoot civilians appeared to be based on hearsay rather than their own experiences. Its investigation found no corroborating evidence for such charges and it closed the inquiry. Later that year BtS published its own report on the Gaza operation, a compilation of some 70 veterans' accounts. Representatives of the Israeli military criticised BtS for publishing anonymous accounts, saying that it made it impossible to investigate reported abusive incidents. Breaking the Silence officials said they could give personal details concerning the soldiers who provide testimonies to official and independent investigations, on the condition that the soldiers' identities were not made public. Following the 2009 BtS report, the Israeli government protested to other governments. It said that the NGO had \\"a clear anti-government agenda\\" and complained to diplomatic personnel of the UK, Netherlands, and Spain to try to dissuade them from continuing their financial support of BtS. The Israeli Ambassador to the Netherlands said that Breaking the Silence was a \\"legal and legitimate organization\\", but said that its funding by the Dutch government was unreasonable \\"in light of the political sensitivities.\\" Another senior Israeli official said in 2009: \\"A friendly government cannot fund opposition bodies. We are not a third world country.\\" Journalist Jonathan Cook reported that the government campaign was promoted by Avigdor Lieberman, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister of Israel, but also had the backing of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Ehud Barak, Israel's defence minister, said: \\"Criticism directed at the IDF by one organisation or another is inappropriate and is directed at the wrong place.\\" In response, ten Israeli-based human rights organizations published a petition (\\"Do not silence 'Breaking the Silence\\") against what they described as the \\"aggressive repression of the organization by the Foreign Ministry of Israel and other governmental agents;\\" they opposed the government's attempt to interfere with the group's funding. Leading politicians of Likud have continued to express hostility to the NGO and other left-wing activist organizations that oppose the settlements and Israel occupation. For instance, in 2015 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticised BtS in an address to the Knesset. His Education Minister Naftali Bennett issued guidelines directing schools to refrain from having representatives speak who were critical of the IDF. In December 2015 Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon banned Breaking the Silence from taking part in any IDF events.\\"Yaalon bans malicious NGO Breaking the Silence from IDF events\\", J Post, As some principals did not observe the Education Minister's guidelines, in December 2016 Education Minister Bennett proposed a bill to Knesset to \\"ban all groups 'that work to damage the IDF' from entering any academic institutions.\\" The bill is believed to be \\"primarily directed at the Breaking the Silence organization, but gives the education minister the power to ban any group deemed hostile to the IDF from entering schools.\\" In response, some of Israel's top brass have come to the defense of the organization. For instance, Retired Major General Amiram Levin published an ad in the Times of Israel, saying that \\"Breaking the Silence guards IDF soldiers in the impossible place in which politicians have abandoned them.\\" In 2016, the Attorney General filed a petition to force BtS to reveal the identity of a soldier whose testimony raised suspicion of possible war crimes related to Operation Protective Edge in Gaza in 2014. Previous court challenges by the IDF have resulted in the court upholding BtS's protection of the confidentiality of its sources. In April 2017, Prime Minister Netanyahu cancelled a meeting with Germany's foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, after the statesman had met with the Breaking the Silence group during his visit to Israel. Germany has in other ways supported Israel at a time of increasing criticism from Europe of its settlements in the Occupied Territories and treatment of civilians there. In June 2017, police investigated an allegation of war crimes made by Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked against BtS spokesperson Dean Issacharoff. The investigation was ordered because of a speech in which Issacharoff said that, as an officer in the Nahal Brigade, he had beaten an unarmed Palestinian protester in Hebron. A month later, Reservists on Duty released a video in which some former members of Issacharoff's platoon said the incident did not take place and said he had lied. Police closed their investigation several months later, saying that they had located and interviewed the alleged victim and concluded the assault described by Issacharoff had not occurred. Following this, a former member of Issacharoff's military company came forward and said he had witnessed the beating.\\"Breaking the Silence Spokesman Cleared of beating Palestinian\\", Times of Israel Breaking the Silence said that investigators failed to question the man that Issacharoff had beaten, but had instead questioned a different Palestinian man whom Issacharoff had arrested on a different occasion., YNet News Issacharoff termed the investigation a \\"farce.\\"\\"Breaking the Silence spokesman doubles down on claim he beat Palestinian\\", Times of Israel His attorney said that in \\"the entire history of Israeli occupation, a file has never been opened so quickly, the Palestinian victim has not been located so quickly and a decision to close the probe has not been made so quickly. This raises the suspicion that this was a political maneuver and not based on relevant considerations.\\" =Criticism of anonymity of accounts= In September 2012, in the wake of a Breaking the Silence report that alleged IDF abuse of Palestinian children, Danny Lamm, president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, expressed his concern that the Israel Defense Forces were unable to investigate claims because they were presented as \\"anonymous ... devoid of critical detail and untested by any kind of cross-questioning.\\" Lamm said that BtS was exploiting the testimonies \\"for propaganda effect\\". Yehuda Shaul of BtS responded that \\"over 70 of our testifiers have come out publicly with their names and identities revealed, and I'm one of them. If the IDF was interested in investigating our claims, we probably would have already been summoned to interrogations.\\" Dana Golan, executive director of Breaking the Silence, said that the testimonies \\"meet the highest standards of investigative journalism\\" and unusual cases are \\"corroborated by two independent sources.\\" In a statement co-signed by 15 ex-soldiers, she accused Lamm of \\"pontificating from afar.\\" In 2009, a BtS spokesman had written that the NGO verified its information by cross-referencing the testimonies it collected, and that BtS would provide additional information to \\"any official and independent investigation\\", including the personal identity of the soldiers, so long as the names were kept confidential. =Reliability of testimonies= Over the years, Breaking the Silence has sometimes been accused by groups affiliated with the Right, such as Im Tirtzu, of fabricating soldiers' testimonies. This issue was brought up again during December 2016 debate over a proposed Knesset bill to ban groups from state schools that \\"work to damage\\" the IDF. This effort was believed to be directed primarily at Breaking the Silence. In July 2016, the investigative television program HaMakor reported that, of a sample of ten of BtS published testimonies, it confirmed two as factual, it believed two were exaggerated, and two were false. It could neither verify nor refute four. Raviv Drucker, a supporter of the NGO, said in the HaMakor program that the group's members \\"act a little bit like a sensational magazine\\" that does not check the facts thoroughly or writes an exaggerated headline, while claiming to hold higher standards. He said that \\"many of the stories they published turned out to be true\\", and that they are holding on to \\"very sexy testimonies\\" and not publishing them because they have not yet been able to \\"fully verify them.\\" BtS responded to the program on its website.Q & A Following \\"Hamakor\\" television show Specifically, how do you explain the testimonies that ‘Hamakor’ found to be false?/\\"Hamakor’ presented four testimonies that the show's investigators were unable to verify. Why?\\", Breaking the Silence, 25 July 2016. Quote:'To reiterate something said by Military Criminal Investigation Division officials as part of the ‘Hamakor’ piece – that dozens of investigations opened as a result of testimonies published by Breaking the Silence were closed only due to the fact that the damage that could be done to the State, through finding out the truth, would be too much. The Military Criminal Investigation Division simply does not want to open the Pandora's box of what is going on in the Occupied Territories.' Support In 2012, Martin Indyk, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel, said that Breaking the Silence was trying to \\"sensitize\\" Israelis to the effect of the occupation. In addition to earlier statements, in 2016 a number of retired senior Israeli security and military figures expressed support or admiration for Breaking the Silence. General Amiram Levin took out a newspaper advertisement, saying that he believed that BtS helped strengthen the IDF and its morality by providing transparency for military actions. General Ami Ayalon wrote that \\"Breaking the Silence protects IDF soldiers in the impossible situation in which politicians have abandoned them.\\" Retired Israel Police Major General Alik Ron and Shin Bet security services chief Ami Ayalon jointly published an advertisement in Haaretz in support of BtS. Yuval Diskin, former head of the Shin Bet, said in 2016 that BtS helps Israel \\"maintain the required vigilance about the most sensitive human issues,\\" as befitting a democratic society.

Description Being an effective elevator operator required many skills. Manual elevators were often controlled by a large lever. The elevator operator had to regulate the elevator's speed, which typically required a good sense of timing to consistently stop the elevator parallel to the floor. In addition to their training in operation and safety, department stores later combined the role of operator with greeter and tour guide, announcing product departments, floor by floor, and occasionally mentioning special offers.  Remaining examples  = Buildings = With the advent of user-operated elevators such as those utilizing push buttons to select the desired floor, few elevator operators remain. A few older buildings still maintain working manually operated elevators and thus elevator operators may be employed to run them. In Dayton, Ohio, the Mendelson Liquidation Outlet operates out of an old Delco building that has an old passenger elevator run by an operator. The Young–Quinlan Building in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota; City Hall in Buffalo, New York; the Commodore Apartment Building in Louisville, Kentucky; City Hall in Asheville, North Carolina; and the Cyr Building in downtown Waterville, Maine are a few in the United States to employ elevator operators. In 2017, it was estimated that over 50 buildings in New York City used elevator operators, primarily in apartment buildings on the Upper East and West Sides of Manhattan, as well as some buildings in Brooklyn. The Stockholm Concert Hall, in Sweden, employs an elevator operator by necessity since there is an entrance to the elevator directly from street level, requiring an employee to be positioned in the elevator to inspect tickets. In more modern buildings, elevator operators are still occasionally encountered. For example, they are commonly seen in Japanese department stores such as Sogo and Mitsukoshi in Japan and Taiwan, as well as high speed elevators in skyscrapers, as seen in Taipei 101, and at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Some monuments, such as the Space Needle in Seattle, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the CN Tower in Toronto employ elevator operators to operate specialized or high-speed elevators, discuss the monument (or the elevator technology) and to help direct crowd traffic. = New York City Subway stations = There are a few elevator operators working in the New York City Subway system. They are located at five stations: 168th Street, 181st Street at St. Nicholas Avenue and at Fort Washington Avenue, 190th Street, and 191st Street in Washington Heights, upper Manhattan. In these stations, elevators serve as the sole or primary means of non-emergency access. The elevator attendants currently serve as a way to reassure passengers as the elevators are the only entrance to the platforms, and passengers often wait for the elevators with an attendant. The attendants at the five stations are primarily maintenance and cleaning workers who suffered injuries that made it hard for them to continue doing their original jobs.  History  The elevators were made automated during the 1970s, but the operators were retained, though they were reduced in quantity in 2003. In 2004, the number of elevator attendants at the stations was reduced to one per station as a result of budget cuts by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The agency had intended to remove all the attendants, but kept one in each station after many riders protested. The change saved $1.2 million a year. In November 2007, the MTA proposed to eliminate the operators' positions, but on December 7, 2007, the MTA announced that it would not remove the remaining elevator operators due to pushback from elected officials and residents from the area. In October 2018, the MTA again proposed removing the elevator operators at the five stations, but this decision was reversed after dissent from the Transport Workers' Union. = Amusement parks = Theme parks and amusement parks often have observation towers, which employ elevator operators. An example is the Sky Tower at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Santa Clarita, California. While these rides may have modern or button-operated elevators that a patron is capable of using, they often employ ride operators for safety and crowd control purposes. Because many jurisdictions have stringent injury liability laws for amusement park operators and the fact that vandalism can be a big problem, some parks do not allow patrons to ride these rides without an employee present. Additionally, if there is a museum at the top of such a ride, the operator will usually give an introduction to the purpose and contents of the museum and other promotional messages about the park. = Elevator girls in Japan = ', shorted to erega, describes the occupation of women who operate elevators in Japan. When the role became common in the 1920s, additional terms such as shokoki garu (\\"up and down controller girl\\"), hakojo (\\"box girl\\"), and erebeta no onna untensyu (\\"woman elevator driver\\") were also used to describe this role. However, erebeta girl remains the popular term for this occupation, a staple sight of urban Japan. Sporting tailored uniforms and robotic smiles, elevator girls are trained extensively in polite speaking and posture. In contrast with the salaryman of Japan, the elevator girl has been symbolic of women's roles in society literally and physically moving up and down as women entered the Japanese workforce. Today, few elevator girls remain in department stores, although those which retain them consider the elevator girl an effective marketing strategy. Elevator girls are an example of feminized occupations in the workplace.  History  Prior to 1929, elevator operators were men. In 1929, the Ueno Branch of Matsuzakaya department store hired women to operate the elevators in its new facilities. In the same year, Yomiuri Shinbun ran an article calling elevator operation the new occupation of Japanese women, commenting on the experiences of the first elevator girls. Although women in the United States had performed the same duty previously, in Japan the shift to female elevator operators was remarkable. At first, female elevator operators had to perform the same functional tasks as male operators, operating levers and closing elevator doors. As elevators became automated, the role shifted to greeting customers, advertising sales to customers, and making announcements.  Depiction  Elevator girls appear in numerous works of literature and film. A key storytelling tool using the elevator girl has been to juxtapose the reserved, controlled role of the elevator girl at work with the unknown, potentially scandalous role that the woman plays in her personal life. A pornographic film featuring Shoji Miyuki, Going Up: I am an Elevator Girl, played off this contrast, telling the story of a demure elevator girl who is secretly a nymphomaniac engaging in sexual activities in the elevator. Popular anime series Crayon Shin Chan featured an elevator girl who became trapped in her elevator when the elevator broke. The 2009 film Elevator Nightmare was advertised by comedienne Torii Miyuki watching the film in an elevator with three professional elevator girls. Karl Greenfeld's 1995 expose of Japanese culture Speed Tribes: Days and Nights with Japan's Next Generation, featured a fictional story of an elevator girl who works the elevator by day and engages in drugs and risky sex by night.

He is best known for his prairie-intimate masterpiece, The Prairie is My Garden. In this painting, a mother and her two children are out gathering flowers from the quintessential prairie of the Great Plains. Early life Dunn was born on a homestead farm near Manchester, South Dakota, in the county made famous by Laura Ingalls Wilder's descriptions of prairie life. The young man’s talent was first recognized by Ada Caldwell, an art instructor at South Dakota Agricultural College (now South Dakota State University), which Dunn attended in 1901-1902. Urged by Caldwell, Dunn pursued his artistic studies in Wilmington, Delaware, under the instruction of Howard Pyle. Dunn was one of a small group of Pyle's defining students who were to revolutionize the illustration world and today are collectively known as the Brandywine School. There he also met William James Aylward and Ernest Peixotto, artists that would later accompany him in the United States Army American Expeditionary Force. Career In 1906, after two years with Pyle, Dunn established his own studio in Wilmington and immediately began a successful career in illustration. He was a prodigious painter, able to produce (on one occasion) fifty-five completed paintings in eleven weeks for various clients. A contemporary described his style in these terms, “He literally attacked a canvas and sometimes I thought he would impale the painting with his brush.” In addition to his illustrations for books, Dunn’s work by then was appearing regularly in such magazines as Collier's Weekly, Harper's Magazine, The Saturday Evening Post, and Scribner's. In 1914, Dunn moved east and settled in Leonia, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from New York City and its publishing world. Inspired by Pyle's example, Dunn opened the Leonia School of Illustration in 1915 with artist Charles S. Chapman.Falkenstein, Michelle. \\"JERSEY FOOTLIGHTS\\", The New York Times, July 31, 2005. Accessed March 31, 2011. \\"Dunn settled in Leonia in 1914 to be near the New York market for illustration and enjoyed a successful career.\\" Illustration for a serialized novel in the June 1922 Harper's Magazine. His experiences at the front as one of eight artist-correspondents with the American Expeditionary Force in Europe were a turning point for the artist. Dunn’s interest in commercial illustration declined on his return to the United States. Instead, the artist envisioned working for several years for the War College committing to canvas his sketches of the battlefields of Europe. Unfortunately, demobilization occurred at a rapid pace, and Dunn’s project was rejected. It became the big heartbreak of his life. However, Dunn was able to salvage part of his ambitious plan; in 1927, he began to paint covers with military themes for The American Legion Monthly magazine. The majority of Dunn’s war sketches are now housed at the Smithsonian Institution in the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The South Dakota Art Museum in Brookings, South Dakota, houses approximately 140 of Dunn's best works. Most of the works are on loan by people from DeSmet and Manchester, South Dakota, or were gifts of the artist and his family. His \\"often seen\\" painting Dakota Woman, from his series of strong pioneer women, is housed at Dakota Discovery Museum in Mitchell, South Dakota. The Chuckwagon is a 1915 Dunn painting owned by the Denver Art Museum. The Smithsonian Institution notes it is a \\"quiet scene depicting a small group of cowboys seated on the ground beside a chuckwagon, their backs turned toward the viewer, their horses standing nearby, and a pond in the background.\\" Later in life Dunn remarked: “The most fruitful and worthwhile thing I have ever done has been to teach.” Dunn became an influential and revered teacher; students referred to him as “Mr. Dunn” as a sign of respect and admiration. The majority of Dunn’s students were either graduate level painters or professional illustrators. Dunn was not interested in teaching painting techniques. His approach was philosophically oriented—he spoke about spirit, emotions, and discourse at length. He discussed his philosophy of life and art, offered group criticism, and strode from easel to easel discussing each student’s work in turn. Dunn’s most inspired teaching was probably achieved at the Grand Central School of Art, which was established by the Grand Central Art Galleries and located on the top floor of Grand Central Terminal in New York City. His comments were captured by a student during a five-hour class session and were published in 1934 in a slim volume titled An Evening in the Classroom. Dunn was a demanding teacher and at times a harsh critic. He believed in preparing his students for the harsh realities and intense competition of the commercial world. Talent was not enough. As he once said, “If you ever amount to anything at all, it will be because you are true to that deep desire or ideal which made you seek artistic expression in pictures.” Other students included Dean Cornwell, James E. Allen, Harry Beckhoff, John Clymer, Mac Conner, Dan Content, Mario Cooper, Wilmot Emerton Heitland, Walt S. Louderback, Henry Clarence Pitz, Arthur Sarnoff, Mead Schaeffer, Harold Von Schmidt, Frank Street, and Saul Tepper. In 1945 Dunn was named a member of the National Academy of Design. He died in New York at the age of 68 from cancer.http://pulpartists.com/Dunn.html His name is memorialized by Harvey Dunn Elementary School, located in the eastern part of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

He was posthumously inducted to the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Biography Radle was best known for his long association with Eric Clapton, starting in 1969 with Delaney and Bonnie and Friends and continuing in 1970 with Derek and the Dominos, recording with drummer Jim Gordon, guitarist Duane Allman, and keyboardist Bobby Whitlock. In 1970 Radle joined Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour. He worked on all of Clapton's solo projects from 1970 until 1979 and was a member of Clapton's touring band, Eric Clapton & His Band, from 1974 to 1979. Radle was instrumental in facilitating Clapton's return to recording and touring in 1974. During Clapton's three-year hiatus, Radle furnished him with a supply of tapes of musicians with whom he had been working. Dick Sims and Jamie Oldaker were the core of Clapton's band during the 1970s. Radle served as more than a sideman, acting also as arranger on several songs, notably \\"Motherless Children\\". Radle earned credit as an associate producer of Clapton's album No Reason to Cry. Radle was a session musician for many of the most famous blues rock and rock and roll artists in the 1970s, including Rita Coolidge and Kris Kristofferson. He appeared in the film The Concert for Bangladesh; recordings from that concert were released as an album in 1972. Over the two-year period before the release of the album The Concert for Bangladesh, Radle recorded albums with Dave Mason, J.J. Cale, George Harrison, Joe Cocker, Leon Russell, and Buddy Guy, among others. He was the bass player in Gary Lewis & the Playboys when they appeared on the Mike Douglas Show. He can be seen in Martin Scorsese's 1978 film The Last Waltz, which documented the final concert of The Band, held in 1976. Over the course of his career, Radle played on a number of gold and platinum singles and albums and garnered the respect of many musicians. His bass lines were often simple and repetitive, but always with the purpose of supporting the song. Radle was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and died at his home in Claremore in May 1980 from a kidney infection, exacerbated by the effects of alcohol and narcotics; he was 37.

Lofberg was laid down on 4 November 1943 by Bethlehem Steel Co., San Francisco, California and launched on 12 August 1944; sponsored by Mrs. G. B. Lofberg, Jr., widow of Lieutenant Commander Lofberg. The ship was commissioned on 26 April 1945, Commander R. O. Beer in command. Service history After shakedown, Lofberg departed the West Coast for the war zone. Since the formal surrender of Japan occurred almost six weeks before she arrived Tokyo Bay, 13 October, the destroyer was assigned to occupation duty. First came the clearing of mines from Japanese harbors, then a series of shuttle runs between Okinawa and Shanghai, and finally her return to San Francisco on 28 March 1946 with a group of Marines embarked at Tsingtao, China. Lofberg was now temporarily assigned to the 3rd Reserve Fleet During the next year she restricted her sailing to short two- week coastal cruises to train Naval Reserves. On 1 July 1947 Lofberg resumed operations with the Pacific Fleet as flagship for DesRon 7. =Korean War= Three years later the outbreak of the Korean War tested the Navy's peacetime stress upon continuous training and physical readiness. On 30 September, under the command of Comdr. R. W. McElrath, Lofberg departed San Francisco on the first of three tours of duty in the new war zone. These operations extended over a three-year period. Upon her initial arrival in Korean waters she became part of the screen for the fast carriers of Task Force (TF) 77. Planes from these carriers played an important part in successful evacuations in November and December of United Nations troops from North Korea in the wake of Chinese Communist intervention. Shifted temporarily to Task Group 96.8, she participated in gunfire support missions first off Korea's west coast and then in company with the battleship against targets along the eastern coast. As on her two succeeding tours she also took part both in the naval siege of Wonsan, Korea, and the preventive patrolling of the Formosa Straits before returning home on 2 July 1951. Even after the Korean armistice of July 1953, Lofberg continued to make annual voyages to the Far East to participate in the activities and responsibilities of the 7th Fleet. By the beginning of 1960 she had lost her flagship status to a more modern-type destroyer. Though called upon as a part of the 1961 South China Sea buildup during a new Laotian crisis, this World War II vintage ship soon returned to San Francisco for a FRAM II rehabilitation and modernization. =New duties and the Vietnam War= Refurbished on 23 July 1962, Lofberg steamed forth to undergo a refresher training cruise and exercises designed to teach the effective use of her new helicopter flight deck. On 22 September she joined DesDiv 153, Pacific Fleet, for tactical training as part of an antisubmarine hunter group. The following 19 April, Lofberg departed the west coast to begin a new series of Far Eastern tours of duty. Lofberg completed her first assignment in time to spend Christmas 1963 at home, but her following voyage lasted from 23 October 1964 until 17 May 1965. To the familiar Formosa Strait patrol was added in February new duties off the coast of war ravaged South Vietnam. These duties included participation in the coastal barrier patrol initiated to prevent the infiltration of men and supplies from North Vietnam. During 1964-1965 cruise Lofberg's division surfaced two Russian submarines and escorted them from South China Sea...Lofberg was part of the Destroyer Division and Carrier Hancock that established Station Yankee in Gulf of Tonkin...

The destroyer reentered the South China Sea 26 April 1966, and during the next six months served first on Yankee Station and then provided gunfire support to allied forces ashore. While assigned to the latter duties she participated in operation \\"Deck House 11\\". Since that time, into 1969, Lofberg had continued to rotate duty with the 1st and 7th Fleets in the Pacific.

Still very large, it originally had a full shichidō garan and 49 subtemples. The sangō is Kofukusan (巨福山). The temple was constructed on the orders of Emperor Go- Fukakusa and completed in 1253, fifth year of the Kenchō era, from which it takes its name. It was founded by Rankei Doryū, a Chinese Zen master who moved to Japan in 1246, spending some years in Kyushu and Kyoto before coming to Kamakura. Kenchō-ji and the shogunate The dragon painted on the ceiling of the Hattō Kamakura Regent Hōjō Tokiyori was the temple's main patron during its early years. The sponsorship was spiritual (he was close to a Zen master himself) as well as political: the Kamakura Gozan, organization of which this temple was head, had an important role in the shogunate's organization. The system, to which the Ashikaga added a series of five temples in Kyoto called the Kyoto Gozan, was adopted to promote Zen in Japan however, there as it had already happened in China, it was soon controlled and used by the country's ruling classes for their own administrative and political ends.Dunn (2007) The Gozan system allowed the temples at the top to function as de facto ministries, using their nationwide network of temples for the distribution of government laws and norms, and for the monitoring of local conditions for their military superiors. The Hōjō first, and the Ashikaga later were therefore able to disguise their power under a religious mask, while monks and priests worked for the government as translators, diplomats and advisers. Under their masters' patronage, Kenchō-ji and the Five Mountain temples gradually became centers of learning and developed a characteristic literature called the Japanese Literature of the Five Mountains.Dumoulin (2005:151-156) During the Japanese Middle Ages, its scholars exerted a far-reaching influence on the internal political affairs of the country. The Gozan system finally declined with the dissolution of the Ashikaga shogunate which had sponsored it. Kenchō-ji's own renaissance came in the 19th century under the guidance of Zen master Aozora Kandō. Buildings and points of interest From right to left the junipers, the Butsuden, the Hattō, the Karamon and the two buildings composing the Hojō Kenchō-ji originally consisted of a shichidō garan with 49 subtemples, but most of these were lost in fires in the 14th and 15th centuries. It still is a classic example of a Zen garan with its buildings aligned north to south. The complex currently consists of ten subtemples. Its most important structures include (in order from the first gate): *The Sōmon (outer gate), where the ticket booths are, which was moved here from the Hanju Zanmai-in temple in Kyoto. *The Sanmon (Main Gate), built in 1754 with donations from all over the Kantō region. According to a popular legend, a raccoon dog (a tanuki) helped raise the money transforming himself into a monk to repay the kindness of the temple's priests. For this reason, even today the sanmon is often called . *The Bonshō (Temple Bell), cast in 1255, which is a National Treasure. *The Butsuden (lit. Buddha Hall), an Important Cultural Property which was moved to Kamakura from Zōjō-ji in Tokyo in 1647. *The Hattō (Dharma Hall), built in 1814, where public ceremonies are held. It is the largest Buddhist wooden structure in Eastern Japan. *The Karamon (Grand Gate), another Important Cultural Property, was brought here from Zōjō-ji together with the Butsuden. *The Hōjō (the head priest's living quarters), also moved from the Hanju Zanmai-in in Kyoto, used for religious ceremonies. *The Monastery, where monks are trained in meditation, which is however permanently closed to the public. It consists of a Zen-dō (meditation hall), of a kaisan- dō (founder's hall, a hall enshrining the temple's founder) and of the administrative offices. * The large Zen garden behind the Hōjō called and which is shaped like the Chinese character for , was designed by famous Zen teacher, scholar, poet, and garden designer Musō Soseki. *A recent ceiling painting by Koizumi Junsaku (2003) portraying a dragon decorates the ceiling of the Hattō, the building behind the Butsuden. For this reason, the Hattō is often called . The Karasu-tengu to whom the Hansōbō is dedicatedIn front of the Butsuden stand some great Chinese juniper trees which have been designated Natural Treasures. At the time of the founding of the temple, these big trees were simple saplings brought from China by the founder Doryū. Underneath the biggest a great stone monument surrounded by chains commemorates those of Kamakura's citizens who died during the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5. = Hansōbō = Near the end of the temple's garden, over a hill stands the Hansōbō, the temple's large tutelary Shinto shrine. The enshrined spirit is the Hansōbō Daigongen.For many centuries now temples all over the country adopt tutelary kami as protectors. These are enshrined in Shinto shrines called chinjusha built for the purpose within the Buddhist temple. The presence of a Shinto shrine within a Buddhist temple is a manifestation of the syncretic fusion of Shinto and Buddhism that was normal until the Meiji restoration. See the article Shinbutsu shūgō. The gongen was originally the tutelary spirit () of Hōkō-ji in Shizuoka and was brought here in 1890 by Aozora Kandō.Kamiya Vol. 2 (2006:24) The statues on the stairs leading to the shrine represent Tengu, entities similar to goblins which accompany the gongen. Some of the creatures have wings and a beak: they are a type of tengu called Karasu-tengu (crow tengu) because of the way they look. On a clear day, from the shrine one can see Mount Fuji to the west, and Sagami bay and Izu Ōshima to the south. The stones in the garden are full of names: they are those of the faithful who donated to the temple, and which belong to over 100 different religious organizations. This area used to be the temple's Inner Sanctuary, which still stands among the trees at the very top of the hill and which can be reached going up the steep stairs that begin on the right of the shrine, in front of the Jizō-dō. Next to the sanctuary there's an observation deck from which, on clear days, are visible Kamakura, Yuigahama and Mount Fuji. At the very end of the garden, next to the Hansōbō, on a small hill overlooking a lake stands the Kaishun-in.A guide to Kamakura, Kenchō-ji, retrieved on October 3, 2008 This remote temple was built in 1334 and enshrines a statue of Monju Bosatsu. Sanmon Kajiwara Segaki-e The Zen Garden behind the Hōjō and its pondOn the 15th of July (Obon, or the festival of the dead) Kenchō-ji celebrates the famous funerary ceremony. The normal funeral rites take place early in the morning under the Sanmon gate.Kamakura Kankō Bunka Kentei Kōshiki Tekisutobukku (2008:170-188) Only at Kenchō-ji, they are later repeated expressly for the soul of Kajiwara Kagetoki, a Kamakura period samurai who died during the political turmoil that followed the death of Minamoto no Sanetomo. The origins of the ceremony are said to go back to the days of Doryū.Mutsu (1995:107-122) The legend says that one day, right after the end of a segaki, (a Buddhist service in favor of suffering spirits) a ghostly figure appeared. Having discovered that the segaki was already over, the warrior seemed so sad that the priest repeated the ceremony just for him. Afterwards, the man revealed he was the ghost of Kajiwara Kagetoki.

A flea flicker is an unorthodox play, often called a \\"trick play\\", in American football which is designed to fool the defensive team into thinking that a play is a run instead of a pass. It can be considered an extreme variant of the play action pass and an extension of the halfback option play.  Description  After the snap the quarterback hands off or laterals the football to a running back or another player on his team, who then runs towards or parallel to the line of scrimmage. Before the running back crosses the line of scrimmage, he laterals the football back to the quarterback, who looks to pass to an eligible receiver. The play is designed to draw defensive players into defending against the run, and away from defending the pass, leaving the quarterback free from any immediate pass rush, and leaving receivers potentially open to catch a pass as their covering defenders may have moved off the pass looking to tackle a ball carrier. The elaborate back-and-forth with the ball also gives time for receivers to get downfield, opening up an opportunity for the long bomb. The flea flicker is an extremely high-risk play and one that is extremely difficult to pull off successfully; a failed flea-flicker can cause substantial loss of yardage or a turnover. The problem is that it takes a significant amount of time for the play to develop. This poses two related problems: one, the offensive line, in order to convincingly sell the run, cannot set up the traditional pocket until after the running back pitches the ball back to the quarterback, and if any lineman crosses the line of scrimmage, it is an ineligible player downfield, negating the play. Two, the long time involved in the handoff, run and pitch back to the quarterback takes away time for the quarterback to make his reads (as he must watch for the ball coming his way so that he doesn't drop the ball instead of scan the defense). This makes the quarterback far more prone to being sacked or making a bad read of the defense and throwing an interception. The fact that the ball changes hands three times after the snap (as opposed to one on a typical play) also means that there are three opportunities to lose possession of the ball because of a botched throw or catch attempt. If either the pitch to the running back or the pitch back to the quarterback inadvertently goes forward, the quarterback's main forward pass then becomes an illegal forward pass (except in the XFL), again negating the play and triggering a penalty.  Origins  Illinois coach Bob Zuppke is credited with the play's invention. The flea flicker made its debut in Illinois' 1925 game against Penn as a fake field goal with Earl Britton, Red Grange, and Chuck Kassel; with Britton lining up as a kicker and Grange at holder, the former and threw to Kassel, who lateraled the ball to Grange. Grange would score a 20-yard touchdown on the play.  Notable examples  Flea flicker plays have been used in some key National Football League games, including the Super Bowl, leading to dramatic results: *January 12, 1969: In Super Bowl III, just before halftime, the Baltimore Colts, trailing 7–0 to the New York Jets, tried a flea flicker, but despite the fact that Jimmy Orr was wide open near the end zone, Earl Morrall threw the ball to fullback Jerry Hill. Jets safety Jim Hudson ended up intercepting the pass. During a regular-season game against the Atlanta Falcons, Morrall used the same play and was able to find Orr for a touchdown. *January 30, 1983: In Super Bowl XVII, the Washington Redskins used a flea flicker to try to fool the Miami Dolphins to no avail. Mindful of the ruse, Miami defensive back Lyle Blackwood intercepted the pass. However, Washington coach Joe Gibbs later pointed out the play was not a total loss, as Blackwood was downed on his own 1-yard line. Washington ended up forcing Miami to punt from deep in their own territory and got the ball back with great field position, setting up a touchdown drive. *November 18, 1985: Joe Theismann of the Washington Redskins infamously had his career come to an end on a nationally televised Monday Night Football game at the hands of New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor. The play in question was a flea flicker attempt which failed to fool the Giants’ defense. When Taylor tackled Theismann, his entire weight came crashing down on Theismann, severely breaking his leg. *January 25, 1987: In Super Bowl XXI, the New York Giants successfully ran a flea flicker play against the Denver Broncos: Quarterback Phil Simms passed the ball to receiver Phil McConkey, who ran all the way to the Broncos 1-yard line before being tackled for a 44-yard gain. The Giants scored a touchdown on the next play. *January 3, 2009: During the NFC Wild Card, Kurt Warner successfully completed a flea flicker against the Atlanta Falcons with running back Edgerrin James and wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald. Warner and the Arizona Cardinals were finding early success running the ball in the first quarter of the game, so Warner handed the ball off to James, who ran about 2 yards towards the line of scrimmage and then turned and pitched the football back 5 yards to Warner. The pitch was almost unseen as the safeties and linebackers had their views blocked by the defensive line, which was collapsing on the running play. The play ended with a 50-yard throw (42 yards officially from the original line of scrimmage) to Fitzgerald, who jumped backwards in the air while in double-coverage to make the catch in the front left corner of the endzone for the touchdown, which helped the Cardinals to take an early 7–0 lead in the game, and ultimately win their first playoff game in 10 years, and their first home playoff game in over 60 years. *January 18, 2009: In the NFC Championship, Kurt Warner successfully completed a flea flicker play against the Philadelphia Eagles with running back J.J. Arrington and wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald. Warner passed to Arrington, who passed back to him. Warner then completed a 62-yard throw to Fitzgerald to complete the touchdown, which helped the Cardinals to increase their lead 14–3 and finish 32–25. *December 4, 2011: In the first game after acquiring quarterback Kyle Orton off waivers, Kansas City Chiefs starter Tyler Palko was benched due to ineffectiveness in the beginning of the second quarter in favor of Orton. The first play run for Orton was a designed flea-flicker, but strong safety Major Wright of the Chicago Bears struck Orton as he threw, causing the pass to fall incomplete and injuring Orton's finger, causing him to miss the remainder of the game. The Chiefs ended up winning 10–3. *January 21, 2017: The New England Patriots ran a flea flicker with 7:53 left in the 2nd quarter of the AFC championship game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Tom Brady handed the ball to running back Dion Lewis on what appeared to be a basic run on first-and-10. But as Lewis approached the line of scrimmage, he stopped and pitched the ball back to Brady, who scanned the field and found a wide-open Chris Hogan for a 34-yard touchdown strike to give the Patriots a 17–6 lead. The Patriots won the game 36–17 en route to their fifth Super Bowl championship. *January 21, 2018: The two conference championship games included three successful flea-flicker plays. First, in the American Football Conference championship, Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles handed off to T.J. Yeldon, who tossed the ball back to Bortles. Bortles then passed to Allen Hurns for a 20-yard gain against the New England Patriots. Later in the fourth quarter, the Patriots retaliated with a flea-flicker pass from Tom Brady to Phillip Dorsett for 31 yards. Finally, in the National Football Conference championship, with the Philadelphia Eagles leading the Minnesota Vikings by 24-7, Eagles RB Corey Clement flicked the ball back to QB Nick Foles, who completed a 41-yard touchdown pass to WR Torrey Smith.

A variant of the North American F-86 Sabre, it was produced until 1958 and used primarily by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) until replaced with the Canadair CF-104 in 1962. Several other air forces also operated the aircraft. There were two major production runs of the aircraft. The first, the Mk. 2 and Mk. 4's with just under 1,000 built, were very similar to their US counterparts, differing only in minor details. The second run, the Mk. 5's and Mk. 6's of similar numbers, were patterned on the later versions of the US Sabre with larger wings for improved maneuverability while replacing the original General Electric J47 engine with the locally-designed more-powerful Avro Canada Orenda. The Mk. 6, with a more powerful version of the Orenda, is widely considered the best of all Sabres. The last of the Canadair Sabres in front-line operation were in Pakistan, whose AIM-9 Sidewinder equipped Mk. 6 models were the backbone of their air force during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. These racked up an impressive victory ratio over their Indian counterparts, which lacked missiles. These were slowly phased out after 1971, with the last examples leaving combat service in 1980. Although replaced by higher-performance designs in most other forces by the 1960s, late-model versions served in secondary roles into the 1970s. Some Orenda-powered examples became famous for other feats. Most notable was the single Mk. 3, the test-bed for the Orenda fit, which Jacqueline Cochran used in 1953 to set several speed records, including becoming the first woman to break the sound barrier. Another, an ex-RCAF Mk. 6 that left service in 1974, went on to become Boeing's chase plane for test flights until 1991. Many of these later aircraft are now preserved in museums. Design and development Cockpit and instrument panel of the Sabre In 1948, the Canadian government decided to re-equip the RCAF with the F-86 Sabre with Canadair contracted to produce them in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. An initial batch of 10 aircraft was ordered for tool verification. The Korean War changed this to a production batch of 100 aircraft. Canadair slowly built up its production facility to make all components with related equipment obtained from other Canadian suppliers. Canadair gave the Sabre the project number CL-13. Canadair produced six versions of the CL-13 Sabre. The sole Sabre Mk.1 was essentially the same as the North American Sabre F-86A. It had a General Electric J47-GE-13 turbojet of 5,200 lbf (23 kN) thrust. The Sabre Mk.2 had the same engine, although after the first 20 aircraft were produced, the remainder of the production run was distinguished in having power-assisted controls and an \\"all-flying\\" tailplane. The sole Sabre Mk 3 was the first of the Canadian Sabres to use the Avro Canada Orenda turbojet (Orenda 3 with 6,000 lbf (27 kN) thrust). The Sabre Mk.4 retained the General Electric engine and was destined for the RAF and was later passed on to other overseas air forces. The Sabre Mk.5 was the next production version, equipped with an Orenda 10 with 6,500 lbf (29 kN) thrust. A change to the Orenda 14 with 7,440 lbf (33 kN) powered the Sabre Mk.6. The last Sabre to be manufactured by Canadair (Sabre #1815), after being donated by the Pakistan Air Force, is now part of the permanent collection in the Western Canada Aviation Museum (WCAM) in Winnipeg, Manitoba. From 1950 to 1958, a total of 1,815 CL-13 Sabres were built at the Canadair plant in Montreal. Operational history Canadair Sabre 2 in Greek Air Force markings in 1955 Canadair Sabre 4 of 414 Squadron RCAF in 1954 The second generation of Canadair Sabre aircraft, and first to be built in quantity, was the Mk 2, with 350 produced from 1952–1953. The RCAF received 290 of these improved aircraft. During the first half of 1952, the remaining 60 Mk.2s were supplied to the U.S. Air Force for use in the Korean War. Most RCAF Mk.2 Sabres were utilized in the air defence role with NATO's No. 1 Air Division in Europe, proving itself to be an outstanding dogfighter. Others were assigned to the training role at bases in Canada. After replacement by the Sabre 5 in RCAF service from 1954, just over 210 surviving Sabre 2s were overhauled and modified in the UK and supplied in roughly equal numbers to the Greek Air Force and Turkish Air Forces.Wagner 1963, p. 124. In mid-1952, the Sabre Mk.4 went into production with the first one flown on 28 August 1952. Apart from some minor structural and systems changes, including improved air-conditioning and gun sight, the Mk 2 and the Mk 4 were identical. Of 438 Mk 4s built, approximately 70 were used temporarily by the RCAF, all surviving examples being passed to the RAF. The other Sabre 4s went directly to the RAF under a mutual aid program, equipping 11 RAF squadrons. The majority served in West Germany with NATO, with two squadrons being based in the UK as part of RAF Fighter Command. The Sabre Mk.4 served with the RAF until mid-1956 when they were replaced by Hawker Hunters. The survivors were overhauled in the UK, fitted with '6-3' wing modifications and handed to the USAF (which had funded these aircraft) which in turn passed them on to other NATO members, with the majority going to Italy and Yugoslavia. On 30 July 1953, the first Sabre Mk.5 flew with the Orenda 10 engine, which gave it a clear rate of climb and ceiling advantage over earlier variants. Other Mk 5 improvements included a new oxygen system and improved maneuverability and low-speed characteristics achieved by increasing the wing chord by six in (15.2 cm) at the root and three in. (7.2 cm) at the wing tip along with fitting a small vertical wing fence. This modification, originated by North American on the F-86F, dramatically improved maneuverability, though the loss of the slatted leading edge increased landing speed and degraded low speed handling considerably. Canadair built 370 Mk 5s with the majority designated for use in the RCAF's Air Division squadrons in Europe to replace the Mk.2s. A total of 75 RCAF Sabre 5s were transferred to the German Luftwaffe during 1957. The Canadair Sabre Mk.6 was the final variant and was considered to be the \\"best\\" production Sabre ever built.Joos 1971, p. 3. It was equipped with a two-stage Orenda engine developing 7,275 lb (3,302 kg.) of static thrust. Its altitude performance and climb rate was enhanced over the Mk 5 and the reinstatement of the wing leading edge slat gave it excellent low-speed characteristics. The first production model was completed on 2 November 1954 and ultimately 655 were built with production terminating on 9 October 1958. A total of 390 Mk 6s went to the RCAF with the majority replacing the existing Canadair Sabre Mk 5s at the Air Division squadrons in West Germany and France. The main air threats to NATO in the 1950s in Central Europe were the early variants of the Soviet MiG- the MiG-15, MiG-17, MiG-19 and MiG-21. Based on the Korean War experience, the selection of the Mk 6 Sabre to provide an effective opposition to the MiG threat proved to be a logical one. Canada's commitment to NATO was to provide 12 squadrons located at four bases – two in France (Marville and Grostenquin) and two in West Germany (Zweibrücken and Baden Soellingen). Initially, the contribution consisted of only Sabre aircraft; however, later it was decided to include the Avro Canada CF-100 aircraft in the defense package to provide a night and all-weather fighter capability. Though the main use of the Sabre by the RCAF was in Europe, they were also used by RCAF Auxiliary part-time units in Canada, replacing de Havilland Vampire jets. 400 \\"City Of Toronto\\" and 411 \\"County Of York\\" Squadrons based at RCAF Station Downsview near Toronto, as well as 401 \\"City Of Westmount\\" and 438 \\"City Of Montreal\\" Squadrons at RCAF Station St-Hubert near Montreal, were equipped with Sabre 5s, as was 442 \\"City Of Vancouver\\" Squadron at RCAF Station Sea Island, near Vancouver. In addition to the RCAF deliveries, 225 Canadair Mk 6 Sabres were exported to the West German Luftwaffe, six were delivered to the Colombian Air Force, and 34 went to the South African Air Force. In January 1966, Germany sold 90 of its Canadian Mk 6 Sabres to Iran. These aircraft were quickly transferred to Pakistan and became the main day fighter of the Pakistan Air Force. Canadair Sabres were the mainstay of their respective air forces in the two major conflicts in which they were employed: the Korean War, where F-86 Sabres racked up an impressive 6-1 kill record, and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. The diminutive Folland Gnat was its main opponent in the Indo-Pakistan war. By the end of 1971, the Gnat proved to be a frustrating opponent for the larger, heavier and older Sabre. The Gnat was referred to as a \\"Sabre Slayer\\" by the Indian Air Force since most of its combat kills during the two wars were against Sabres.Bingham 2002\\"Book review of Three countries, One people By D.S.

Moreover, because the Gnat was lightweight and compact in shape, it was hard to see, especially at the low levels where most of the dogfights took place.Spick, Mike.

In 1952, Jacqueline Cochran, then aged 47, decided to challenge the world speed record for women, then held by Jacqueline Auriol. She tried to borrow an F-86 from the U.S. Air Force, but was refused. She was introduced to an Air Vice-Marshal of the RCAF who, with the permission of the Canadian Minister of Defence, arranged for her to borrow 19200, the sole Sabre 3. Canadair sent a 16-man support team to California for the attempt. On 18 May 1953, Ms. Cochran set a new 100 km speed record of 1,050.15 km/h (652.5 mph). Later on 3 June, she set a new 15 km closed circuit record of 1078 km/h (670 mph). While she was in California, she exceeded 1270 km/h in a dive, and thus became the first woman to exceed the speed of sound. =Golden Hawks= Golden Hawks flying team, 1959 The Golden Hawks were a Canadian aerobatic flying team that was established in 1959 to celebrate the Royal Canadian Air Force's 35th anniversary and the \\"Golden\\" 50th anniversary of Canadian flight, which began with the AEA Silver Dart in 1909. Initially, a six-plane team flying brilliantly-painted metallic-gold Canadair Sabre Mk.5s, was envisioned as performing for only one year, but the Golden Hawks were so popular after their single 63-show season that the team was expanded. In the following year, another plane was added to the team, allowing for a five-plane main formation with two solo jets. The Golden Hawks continued performing for three more seasons, changing to the Mk 6 in 1961, until they were disbanded on 7 February 1964, having flown a total of 317 shows across North America.Dempsey 2002 Variants 92 Squadron RAF Fighter Command in 1955 Preserved Canadair Sabre 6 ;Sabre Mk.1 :One built, prototype F-86A. ;Sabre Mk.2 :350 built, F-86E-type, 60 to USAF, three to RAF, 287 to RCAF. ;Sabre Mk.3 :One built in Canada, test-bed for the Orenda 3 jet engine, various other structural modifications were made to accommodate the Orenda engine. ;Sabre Mk.4 :438 built, production: ten to RCAF, 428 to RAF as Sabre F 4. ;Sabre Mk.5 :370 built, F-86F-type with Orenda engine, all to RCAF, 75 later passed to German Air Force. ;Sabre Mk.6 :655 built, 390 to RCAF, 225 to Luftwaffe, six to Colombia and 34 to South Africa.

Television Holmes was the announcer for The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers (1986–1988), the initial broadcast offering of the then-new Fox Broadcasting Company. In 1991 he hosted \\"New York at Night,\\" a talk show that aired on WWOR in New York City for a year and won a local Emmy. Las Vegas – Page 35 2067120352 Michelin, Michelin Travel Publications (Firm) – 2006 – A former correspondent for Entertainment Tonight, Holmes hosted his own Emmy-winning talk/variety show on WOR, New York at Night. . In 1996, The New York Times Theater Review stated; \\"Comfortable Shoes\\" written and performed by Holmes: \\"Whether you choose to endure two and a half hours of Mr. Holmes acting and singing it out, with the assistance of seven other actors and singers, is up to your tolerance for ego-driven show-biz excursions into the orbit of the vanities. It is also dependent on your predisposition to Mr. Holmes's talents. And it has a lot to do with your need for an assertiveness-training manual in the guise of musical theater...it looks as if Mr. Holmes wrote the book on self-indulgence.\\" Holmes has been a Las Vegas show attraction since the early 1970s. In 2006, he closed his headlining show at Harrah's Las Vegas Casino, which renamed its main showroom for him. From 1990 to 1995, he hosted Honda Campus All-Star Challenge on the BET network, and, after the event became non- broadcast, continued to host the final matches through 2008. Most of Holmes' Vegas band members also appear in a locally popular R&B;/jazz group, Santa Fe and The Fat City Horns. Holmes has annually returned to Buffalo each March to co-host the annual Variety Kids telethon on WKBW-TV. With the opening of the Smith Center for the Performing Arts in 2012, Holmes performs monthly in the Cabaret Jazz Theater. He performed Auld Lang Syne in the Smith Center in Las Vegas following the New Year's celebration's firework show on January 1, 2016.

The Prittle Brook is a minor watercourse in south Essex, England. A short tributary of the River Roach, the brook rises near Thundersley and discharges into the North Sea via the Roach and Crouch estuaries. Description It appears to rise in Thundersley, just to the west of West Wood. Flowing eastwards, it courses through West Wood, then briefly under some private properties before crossing Daws Heath Road. It then flows through private property again before reaching Dodds Grove Nature Reserve and then into Great Wood, Belfairs Wood. A pathway (officially designated the \\"Prittle Brook Greenway\\" in 2010) enables walkers to follow the section of the Brook from Belfairs, past Southend University Hospital to Roots Hall, effectively providing a route from Leigh into Southend which avoids the main roads. This pathway, built in the 1940s, passes under several roads; the bridge which leads to Our Lady of Lourdes School in Manchester Drive runs directly over the Brook. This part of the Brook's route has been urbanised since the 1930s, and the banks have been concreted east of the Belfairs Wood area. As a consequence, the velocity of the river has greatly increased, a phenomenon particularly noticeable during and after heavy rain. The Prittle Brook Greenway was the object of major improvement work between 2009 and 2012, during which the sections running parallel with Blenheim Chase and Prittlewell Chase were widened and signposted. The Prittle Brook then flows under the A127, through Priory Park and north, past London Southend Airport and eventually enters the River Roach at Purdeys Way.

He held that office for only two days, and was known for his opposition to slavery. A Whig until the party collapsed, he supported compromise with the south. He became an early leader in the Republican Party starting in 1856 serving as the president of the first party convention, delivering its keynote address, and was influential in the nomination of Abraham Lincoln. With the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, he became a full-fledged abolitionist, and in the Senate he was a pro-Union advocate and a strong supporter of the war effort to end the rebellion. Early life =Family and background= Henry Smith Lane was born in Bath County, Kentucky near Sharpsburg on February 24, 1811, the son of James H. and Mary Higgins Lane. He received a classical education from private tutors and studied law; he was admitted to the bar in Mount Sterling, Kentucky in 1832. He moved to Crawfordsville, Indiana, in 1835 working at the Bank of Indiana and opening a law office, taking mainly criminal cases.Woollen, p. 120 Lane was an opponent of slavery early in life, and came to support Henry Clay while he lived in Kentucky. At age 20, he delivered an anti-slavery speech to the Colonization Society in October 1831. In the speech he declared, \\"The History of all times admonishes us that no man or community of men can be kept forever in slavery.\\" While Lane opposed to expansion of slavery he was not in favor of abolition, but like Henry Clay he believed that over time slavery would die out if it was prevented from spreading.Woollen, p. 128 In 1833 he married to Pamela Bledsoe Jameson. The couple had no children, and his wife was killed in a stage coach accident 1842; Lane escaped the accident with only minor injuries.Gugin, p. 138 Active in Whig politics, he was a member of the Indiana Senate in 1837 as a representative of Montgomery County and a member of the Indiana House of Representatives in 1838–39. Lane was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1840 to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Tilghman A. Howard, he won reelection defeating John Bryce by overwhelming majority the next year, and served until 1843. He did not seek reelection to a second full term. While in office, he was in favor of compromising with the south over the slavery issue and openly condemned the abolitionists agitators as promoting disunity. =Mexican–American War= During the 1844 elections, Lane stumped most of Indiana for presidential candidate Henry Clay. He married Joanna Maria Elston, a daughter of Isaac Compton Elston, a major investor in the Bank of Indiana in 1845.Joanna's sister, Susan Wallace was the wife of Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace; the two men were close friends and the Wallace's named their only child Henry Lane Wallace. Lane returned to his law practice after the election and remained there until the outbreak of the Mexican–American War. In May 1846, Lane attended the war meeting held in Indianapolis, and became and active member, writing part of the resolutions the meeting issued, pledging troops for the invasion of Mexico. After the meeting, Lane set out to personally raise a company of men to join the war effort, and he served during the war at its head, and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel of the First Regiment Indiana Infantry. His regiment spent most of the war in Mexico, guarding supply lines and military posts, and saw little action. When his companies' enlistment expired, Lane returned to Indiana by ship, landing in Madison, Indiana. He there confronted many members of the Whig party who were opposed to the war and publicly decried their lack of support for the cause. Lane then set out to organize a new company and set out again for Mexico as part of the Fifth Indiana Regiment Infantry, and remained in Mexico for the duration of the war.Woollen, p. 121 Shifting parties After returning from the war, Lane was a candidate for Congress in 1849, challenging Joseph E. McDonald. The election was a close contest, but Lane was ultimately defeated and returned to private life. He abandoned the profession of law and engaged in the banking business at Crawfordsville in 1854. The same year the Know Nothing Party was established and Lane joined, along with many other disaffected Whigs. In the legislature he was a strong supporter of sending a Know-Nothing candidate to the United States Senate. The debate began the start of a period of divisive state politics that would continue until the American Civil War. The Democrats refused to allow the new party any national representation, and Ashbel Willard, who was President of the State Senate, was able to lock up voting and prevent any Senator from being elected. The situation exploded and the Know-Nothings responded by locking up the entire General Assembly.Woollen, p. 122 The results were disastrous and the Know- Nothing party quickly fell apart, but the battle brought Lane national fame in standing up to the Democrats. In 1856 Lane attended the first Republican National Convention. He was elected president of the convention and gained national recognition for his oratory. After the convention he returned to Indiana and stumped the state for the new party. That year Republicans gained a strong representation in the General Assembly and, with the support of some Democrats, were able to elect Lane and William McCarty to the United States Senate. The two men went to Washington to challenge the state's sitting senators, but the Senate refused to accept the new senators. In 1857, the Missouri Compromise was repealed. The act had a profound effect on Lane's position on slavery. While before he had supported compromise on the issue, the law's repeal led him to become a full-fledged abolitionist and favor anti- slavery action on the national level. Republican =Gubernatorial campaign= Lane returned to Indiana where he continued to spread the ideas of the new party. In 1860, the state Republican convention chose Lane to run for governor, and Oliver Morton as lieutenant governor. They challenged Thomas Hendricks on the Democratic ticket. Prior to the election it was negotiated that Lane would be elected to the Senate and Morton would continue as governor. The men canvased the entire state. After a major speech in Evansville, Lane attended the second Republican National Convention, and was influential in helping Abraham Lincoln win the presidential nomination. Lane and Lincoln had a friendly relationship and Lincoln once said of Lane, \\"Here comes an uglier man than I am\\".Lane himself told the story of Lincoln's remark. Dumas Malone (ed.), Dictionary of American Biography, vol. 5, part 2, New York:Charles Scribner's Sons (1961), p. 575, col. 1.Woollen, p. 123 Returning to Indiana after the convention, he held a final debate with Hendricks in Fort Wayne. Lane was not as skilled a debater as Hendricks, but was considered a superior orator. Lane refused to have any more debates with his opponent, and instead traveled across the state again giving speeches. The election was close and Lane defeated Hendricks by about 1,000 votes and was elected governor; he was inaugurated January 14, 1861. However, he served just two days, and resigned to accept a seat in the U.S. Senate to honor the agreement with running mate Morton, who then became governor. =Senator= Lane was again elected by the Republican-controlled Indiana Legislature, but again the Democratic-dominated U.S. Senate refused to seat him. As southern states began to secede from the Union, however, the Southern majority quickly gave way and Lane was permitted to be seated. He served from March 4, 1861, to March 3, 1867, and was a supporter of President Lincoln's policies during the Civil War. While in the Senate he was chairman of the Committee on Engrossed Bills (Thirty-seventh through Thirty-ninth Congresses) and a member of the Committee on Pensions (Thirty-ninth Congress). Return to private life Lane's house in Crawfordsville After his Senate term ended, Lane returned to Crawfordsville, never again to hold elected office. He served as special Indian commissioner from 1869 to 1871, and was commissioner for improvement of the Mississippi River, appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant.Woollen, p. 124 On June 18, 1881, Lane entertained some friends at his home in Crawfordsville for the evenings. After the party he began to have severe chest pains, and he died the next afternoon, June 19 around 1 pm, of an apparent heart-attack. His death was reported nationally, and biers were held nationwide. Lane was buried on June 21, his pallbearers being former governors of the state, and fellow senators. He was buried in a vault in Oak Hill Cemetery, and that state erected a monument over his grave.Woollen, p. 127 See also * List of governors of Indiana References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Dumas Malone (ed.), Dictionary of American Biography, vol. 5, part 2, New York:Charles Scribner's Sons (1961), pp. 574–575.

Endothelial cells store IL-8 in their storage vesicles, the Weibel-Palade bodies. In humans, the interleukin-8 protein is encoded by the CXCL8 gene. IL-8 is initially produced as a precursor peptide of 99 amino acids which then undergoes cleavage to create several active IL-8 isoforms. In culture, a 72 amino acid peptide is the major form secreted by macrophages. There are many receptors on the surface membrane capable of binding IL-8; the most frequently studied types are the G protein- coupled serpentine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. Expression and affinity for IL-8 differs between the two receptors (CXCR1 > CXCR2). Through a chain of biochemical reactions, IL-8 is secreted and is an important mediator of the immune reaction in the innate immune system response.  Function  IL-8, also known as neutrophil chemotactic factor, has two primary functions. It induces chemotaxis in target cells, primarily neutrophils but also other granulocytes, causing them to migrate toward the site of infection. IL-8 also stimulates phagocytosis once they have arrived. IL-8 is also known to be a potent promoter of angiogenesis. In target cells, IL-8 induces a series of physiological responses required for migration and phagocytosis, such as increases in intracellular Ca2+, exocytosis (e.g. histamine release), and the respiratory burst. IL-8 can be secreted by any cells with toll-like receptors that are involved in the innate immune response. Usually, it is the macrophages that see an antigen first, and thus are the first cells to release IL-8 to recruit other cells. Both monomer and homodimer forms of IL-8 have been reported to be potent inducers of the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. The homodimer is more potent, but methylation of Leu25 can block the activity of homodimers. IL-8 is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by viral infection. IL-8 is a member of the CXC chemokine family. The genes encoding this and the other ten members of the CXC chemokine family form a cluster in a region mapped to chromosome 4q.  CXCL-8 mediated chemotaxis of the neutrophil  CXCL8 is the primary cytokine involved in the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of damage or infection; in a process called chemotaxis. A number of variables are essential for the successful chemotaxis of neutrophils, including the increased expression of high affinity adhesion molecules to secure the neutrophil to the endothelium near the affected site (and is therefore not washed away into the circulatory system), and that the neutrophil can digest its way through the basement membrane and the extracellular matrix (ECM) to reach affected site. CXCL8 plays a key role in inducing the cell signalling necessary to bring about these changes. Firstly, at the site of infection histamine release causes vasodilation of the capillaries near the injured area which slows down the blood flow in the region and encourages leukocytes, such as neutrophils, to come closer to the endothelium, and away from the centre of the lumen where the rate of blood flow is highest. Once this occurs weak interactions are made between the selectins expressed on the neutrophil and endothelial cells (expression of which is also increased through the action of CXCL8 and other cytokines). On the neutrophil these are: L selectins, and on the endothelial cell: P and E selectins. This causes the \\"rolling\\" phase of chemotaxis. Once the neutrophil is rolling along the endothelium, it will come into contact with a CXCL8 molecule expressed on the surface which stimulates the cell signalling pathway, mediated through a G-coupled-protein-receptor. The binding of CXCL8 to CXCR1/2 on the neutrophil stimulates the neutrophils to upregulate their expression of the integrin, LFA-1, which takes part in high affinity bonding with ICAM-1 receptors expressed on the endothelium. The expression and affinity of LFA-1 is significantly increased to maximise binding. This causes the neutrophil to slow down more until it is stationary. Another key function of the cell signalling stimulated by CXCL8, is the initiation of the oxidative burst. This process allows the build up of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are necessary to break down the ECM and basement membrane. These are released in secretory granules, along with more integrins. The release of ROS and damaging enzymes is regulated to minimise host damage, but continues to reach site of infection at which it will carry out its effector functions.  Target cells  While neutrophil granulocytes are the primary target cells of IL-8, there are a relatively wide range of cells (endothelial cells, macrophages, mast cells, and keratinocytes) that respond to this chemokine. The chemoattractant activity of IL-8 in similar concentrations to vertebrates was proven in Tetrahymena pyriformis, which suggests a phylogenetically well-conserved structure and function for this chemokine.  Clinical significance  Interleukin-8 is a key mediator associated with inflammation where it plays a key role in neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil degranulation. As an example, it has been cited as a proinflammatory mediator in gingivitisHaake, SK, Huang, GTJ: Molecular Biology of the host-Microbe Interaction in Periodontal Diseases (Selected Topics). In Newman, Takei, Carranza, editors: Clinical Periodontology, 9th Edition. Philadelphia: W.B.Saunders Co. 2002. page 162. and psoriasis. Interleukin-8 secretion is increased by oxidant stress, which thereby cause the recruitment of inflammatory cells and induces a further increase in oxidant stress mediators, making it a key parameter in localized inflammation. IL-8 was shown to be associated with obesity. IL-8 has also been implied to have a role in colorectal cancer by acting as an autocrine growth factor for colon carcinoma cell lines or the promotion of division and possible migration by cleaving metalloproteinase molecules. If a pregnant mother has high levels of interleukin-8, there is an increased risk of schizophrenia in her offspring. High levels of Interleukin 8 have been shown to reduce the likelihood of positive responses to antipsychotic medication in schizophrenia. IL-8 has also been implicated in the pathology of cystic fibrosis. Through its action as a signalling molecule IL-8 is capable of recruiting and guiding neutrophils to the lung epithelium. Overstimulation and dysfunction of these recruited neutrophils within the airways results in release of a number of pro-inflammatory molecules and proteases resulting in further damage of lung tissue.  Regulation of expression  The expression of IL-8 is negatively regulated by a number of mechanisms. MiRNA-146a/b-5p indirectly represses IL-8 expression by silencing the expression of IRAK1. Additionally, the 3'UTR of IL-8 contains a A/U-rich element that makes it extremely unstable under certain conditions. IL-8 expression is also regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB. NF-κB regulation represents a novel anti-IL-8 therapy for use in inflammatory diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Pathways leading to the induction of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) phosphorylation have also been found to enhance IL-8 protein synthesis. This translational control of IL-8 expression is dependent on A/U-rich proximal sequences (APS), which are found in the 3'UTR of IL-8 immediately after the stop codon.  Nomenclature  IL-8 was renamed CXCL8 by the Chemokine Nomenclature Subcommittee of the International Union of Immunological Societies,. Its approved HUGO gene symbol is CXCL8. Its receptors were similarly renamed: * Interleukin 8 receptor, alpha — CXCR1 * Interleukin 8 receptor, beta — CXCR2  References   Further reading    Cytokines ","title":"Interleukin 8"},{"id":"2828480","text":"Halford is an American heavy metal band formed in 1999 by British singer Rob Halford, who is best known as the lead vocalist for Judas Priest.

Biography Knight was born in Boston to Captain Thomas Kemble, a merchant of Boston, and Elizabeth Trerice. In 1689, she married Richard Knight. They had one child, Elizabeth. Having been left a widow after her husband's death in 1703, Knight assumed the responsibility of managing her household. When she composed the journal, Knight was a 38-year-old married woman and keeper of a boarding house in Boston with some experience as a copier of legal documents. She was on her way to New Haven (and later to New York City) to act on behalf of a friend in the settlement of her deceased husband's estate. Knight kept a journal of her trip, and it provides us with one of the few first-hand-accounts of travel conditions in Connecticut during colonial times. Journey from Boston to New York approximate route of Sarah Kemble Knight's Journey, 1704-1705 Knight chose to travel with a post rider or other reliable guide, so she was never alone on the road. Still, the difficulties she encountered speak volumes about the physical dangers of long-distance travel by horseback in that era. In crossing the Thames River in a ferry boat that carried both passengers and their horses, she wrote in an entry dated “Thirsday, Octobr ye 5th”: “Here, by reason of a very high wind, we mett with great difficulty in getting over—the Boat tos’t exceedingly, and our horses capper’d at a very surprizing Rate, and set us all in a fright.” The following day, after traveling for miles over roads that were “very bad, incumbered with rocks and mountainous passages,” Sarah Knight came to “a bridge under which the river ran very swift, my horse stumbled, and very narrowly escaped falling into the water, which extremely frightened me.” As for room and board, Sarah Knight spent an evening with the Congregationalist minister in New London, “where I was very handsomely and plentifully treated and Lodg’d.” The minister, she noted, was “the most affable, courteous, Genero’s and best of men.” Such experiences, however, were offset by others less wholesome. In Saybrook, where Madam Knight stopped for a mid-day dinner, she complained of the landlady: “Shee told us shee had some mutton wch shee would broil, wch I was glad to hear; […] but it being pickled and my Guide said it smelt strong of head sause, we left it, and pd sixpence apiece for our Dinners, wch was only smell.” Further on, at a public house in Fairfield, Ms. Knight was likewise unable to eat the meal prepared for her and went to bed supperless. On being shown to her room, “a little Lento Chamber furnisht amongst other Rubbish with a High Bedd and a Low one […] down I laid my poor Carkes (never more tired) and found my Covering as scanty as my Bed was hard.” Before crossing a particularly hazardous river, Knight cannot rid herself of thoughts of drowning, writing, \\"The concern of mind this relation sett me in: no thoughts but those of the dang'ros River could entertain my Imagination, and they were as formidable as varios, still Tormenting me with blackest Ideas of my Approaching fate–Sometimes seeing my self drowning, otherwhiles drowned, and at the best like a holy Sister just come out of a Spiritual Bath in dripping Garments.\\"Knight, 13. This is not the last danger water presents during Knight's journey. Near the end of the journey, she has a rather close call when she writes, \\"But in going over the Causeway at Dedham the Bridge being overflowed by the high waters coming down I very narrowly escaped falling over into the river Hors and all wch twas almost a miracle I did not.\\"Knight, 56. In addition to the danger posed by the rivers, Knight writes about the less than ideal roads on which she must travel. She explains in her straightforward manner that \\"[t]he Rodes all along this way are very bad, Incumbred with Rocks and mountainos passages, wch were very disagreeable to my tired carcass.\\"Knight, 28. These examples provide just a sampling of the dangers faced by Knight on her journey as chronicled in her journal. Knight persevered and after six days on the road arrived in New Haven, where she visited with relatives before resuming her trip to New York, which took an additional three days of hard travel. =Journal= She recounted her experiences during the five-month journey in the “journals” that have made her known to students of American colonial literature and history. The small diary of her Boston–New York journey passed into private hands and lay undiscovered until 1825 when it was published posthumously as The Journal of Mme Knight by Theodore Dwight.\\"Sarah Kemble Knight\\". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 03 Oct. 2014. The Journal of Madam Knight has subsequently been reprinted by others with additional biographical information. =Her journal= Her journal remains noteworthy both for its larger-than-life central character (Knight) and its telling of a trying journey not normally undertaken by a woman. The discomforts of primitive traveling are described with much sprightliness and not a little humor, including poems of gratitude and relief about finding moonlight, and poems of frustration about the loud sounds of drunken men late at night. The journal is valuable as a history of the manners and customs of the time, and is full of graphic descriptions of the early settlements in New England and New York. At the same time, it is interesting for its original orthography and interspersed rhymes. Later life In 1706 she opened a boarding house and taught school, which gained some reputation in Boston. She is described as “excelling in the art of teaching composition.” In 1713, Knight's daughter married John Livingston, of Connecticut, and the son of Robert Livingston the Elder, and Madam Knight moved with them to New London, where she continued her business and land dealings. Madam Knight, as she was generally called as a mark of respect, spent the rest of her life either in New London or Norwich, Connecticut. She owned several farms in New London, and had a home in Norwich. She ran an inn out of the Livingston farm in New London. In the widowed years of her life, Sarah Kemble Knight left Boston for good and moved to New London to live near her married daughter. There, she owned a tavern and an inn, engaged in the buying and selling of land for speculation and became a respected member of her church. Sarah Knight died at age 62 and is buried in New London. Sarah Kemble Knight is buried at Ye Antientist Burial Ground, New London. Relevance and reception Since its publication, The Journal of Madam Knight has been valued as both an historical and literary document. As a travel narrative, it recounts the dangerous and primitive conditions of travel in the colonies at this time period. Furthermore, Knight's detailed descriptions of New York, New Haven, and the many small settlements she travels through across Connecticut, shed light on colonial life at the turn of the 18th century. She documents eating habits, architecture, religious diversity, and various fashions of the people of New York and New Haven, as well as the living conditions found in rural settlements between Boston and New York. Knight's diary has also been important in the field of women's history and literary recovery, both of which are movements that seek to recover narratives often forgotten or neglected in favor of more mainstream, canonized works.Marsden, Jean I. “Beyond Recovery: Feminism and the Future of Eighteenth-Century Literary Studies.” Feminist Studies 28.3 (Autumn 2002): 657-662. JSTOR. Web. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178795 As a woman's diary, The Journal of Madam Knight represents a deviation from the traditional masculine canon. While her status as a feminist figure remains open for debate, Knight's diary has merited study for its record of an unusual situation (a woman traveling alone through the New England wilderness); for its uncharacteristically outward focus (as opposed to the typical, inwardly reflective, Puritan diary); and for the unique judgements and strong personality contained within it.Stern, Julia. “To Relish and To Spew: Disgust as Cultural Critique in The Journal of Sarah Kemble Knight.” Legacy 14.1 (1997): 1-12. JSTOR. Web. https://www.jstor.org/stable/25679210 While many critics and scholars have praised Knight's Journal as an historical account, some scholars, such as Robert O. Stephens, believe it should also be read as an imaginative and creative work. Stephens asserts that \\"By recognizing the mythic implications of Madam Knight's Journal, even at the expense of its mimetic and outwardly historical impact, we are able to place the work more clearly in the fruitful tradition of colonial American, and particularly New England, literature...Identification of the individual mythic allusions is only a matter of reading, but seeing the tantalizing pattern they fall into is an indication that this innocent and rough-mannered journal has meanings that a literal reading cannot guess at.\\"Stephens, Robert O. \\"The Odyssey of Sarah Kemble Knight.\\" CLA Journal 7.3 (Mar. 1964): 247-255. Rpt. in Literature Criticism from 1400 to 1800. Ed. James E. Person, Jr. Vol. 7. Detroit: Gale Research, 1988. Literature Resource Center. Web. 5 Oct. 2014. By reading the Journal as a mythical account, Stephens hopes to align Knight's work with the narrative style of Nathaniel Hawthorne.Stephens, 247-255 Structure Knight's journal is largely a ledger of the places and people she encountered during each day of her trip. The extended scenes highlight remarkable or memorable interactions, usually with people that Knight has strong opinions about.Knight, Sarah Kemble. \\"The Journal of Madam Knight.\\" The Puritans. Ed. Perry Miller and Thomas H. Johnson. New York: American Book Company, 1938. Web. For example, early in the journal, crosses a swamp with a man she sarcastically describes as \\"honest John.\\" She recounts of how he embellishes the stories of his adventures to appear to her as \\"a Prince disguis'd.\\" Upon reaching the next stop, Knight is confronted with this man's eldest daughter, who interrogates her with \\"silly questions\\" referring to the unusualness of a woman being on such a journey, to which Knight responds curtly, calling her rude. These instances of hyperbole and character judgment contrast with other, apparently less remarkable interactions, such as the following account of a transaction between two postmen (one of which was her guide), in which she does not even name her guide: \\"About 8 in the morning, I with the Post proceeded forward without observing any thing remarkable; And about two, on, Arrived at the Post's second stage, where the western Post mett him and exchanged Letters.\\" This account, however, is immediately followed by a detailed description of a meal Knight was served, which appears to have been notable for its unpleasant appearance and aftermath. Extended scenes describing Knight's unpleasant encounters with food occur often throughout her journal. Some moments during the journey appear to have had a profound impact on Knight. These experiences are marked by distinct poetic interludes in her journal, in which she abandons the conventions of prose and resorts to metrical composition. In one instance, Knight finds herself riding her horse in the pitch-dark woods alone late at night. She feels intensely fearful until the moon reveals itself and lights her way, after which she experiences a transcendental sense of relief and gratitude toward the moon. She unpacks this tightly bound moment with the following solvent prose: > Fair Cynthia, all the Homage that I may > Unto a Creature, unto thee I pay; > In Lonesome woods to meet so kind a guide, > To Mee's more worth than all the world beside. > Some Joy I felt just now, when safe got or'e > Yon Surly River to this Rugged shore, > Deeming Rough welcomes from these clownish Trees, > Better than Lodgings with Nereidees. > Yet swelling fears surprise; all dark appears– > Nothing but Light can dissipate those fears. > My fainting vitals can't lend strength to say, > But softly whisper, O I wish 'twere day. > The murmer hardly warma the Ambient air, > E' re thy Bright Aspect rescues from despair: > Makes the old Hagg her sable mantle loose, > And a Bright joy do's through my Soul diffuse. > The Boistero's Trees now Lend a Passage Free, > And pleasant prospects thou giv'st light to see. Later, she encounters a very poor family, for whom she seems pretends to an overwhelming sense of empathy (a convention of verse at the time). She draws out the emotional nuances of this vision as follows: > Tho' Ill at éase, A stranger and alone, > All my fatigues shall not extort a grone. > These Indigents have hunger wth their ease; > Their best is worn behalfe then my disease. > Their Misirable butt wch Heat and Cold > Alternately without Repulse do hold; > Their Lodgings thyn and hard, their Indian fare > The mean Apparel which the wretches wear, > And their ten thousand ills wch can't be told, > Makes nature er'e 'tis middle age'd look old. > When I reflect, my late fatigues do seem > Only a notion or forgotten Dreem. Although written as a journal and despite her occasional poetic flights, Knight's writing is primarily focused outward, concerned with taking inner stock of her external surroundings as she travels both inwardly and outwardly. In one instance, she notes that some of her experiences and stories are \\"not proper to be Related by a Female pen,\\" suggesting that even though she wrote privately, Knight was aware of the possibility her work might be read by an external party. However she made no effort to publish and seems to have forgotten to have the journal destroyed before she died, as was common at the time.Knight, 37. Danger, Courage, and Determination Knight's journey was a difficult one for a woman of her station, and both the perils and her courage and recklessness throughout the journey are illustrated in multiple moments throughout her journal. Knight's knowledge of business and determination is apparent early in her account of her journey when she writes about an exchange concerning payment for an escort. She tells the woman attempting to get more money from her simply that she “would not be accessary to such extortion.”Knight, 4. In the end, Knight stands her ground and is able to bypass the negotiator, deal directly with the would-be escort, and arrange a price she feels is fair. Knight must traverse some rather dangerous landscapes unfamiliar to her. Along the way, Knight may seem to feel fear or apprehension. Humor Despite the hardships of her journey, Knight infused humor into her journal as she traveled. In addition, many scholars of American Literature cite Knight's picaresqueThorpe, Peter. \\"Sarah Kemble Knight and the Picaresque Tradition.\\" CLA Journal 10.2 (Dec. 1966): 114-121.

Racism and Class Concerns Sarah Kemble Knight was a complex human being with early American racial and class sensibilities. Knight refers to racial interactions between slaves and whites with shrewd powers of observation: \\"But too Indulgent (especially ye farmers) to their slaves: suffering too great familiarity from them, permitting ym to sit at Table and eat with them, (as they say to save time,) and into the dish goes the black hoof as freely as the white hand.\\"Knight, 36 Knight also showed insight into Native Americans: \\"There are every where in the Towns as I passed, a Number of Indians the Natives of the Country, and are the most salvage of all the salvages of that kind that I had ever Seen: little or no care taken (as I heard upon enquiry) to make them otherwise.\\"Knight, 37 Knight comments that a certain country gentleman is animal-like and uncouth. She says that country people, like cows, \\"seldom Loose their Cudd.\\"Knight, 41 She also describes the previously mentioned country gentleman as \\"spitting a Large deal of Aromatick Tincture, he gave a scrape with his shovel like shoo, leaving a small shovel full of dirt on the floor, made a full stop, Hugging his own pretty Body with his hands under his arms, Stood staring rown'd him, like a Catt let out of a Baskett.\\" Clearly, Knight's account of the strangers she met on her journey would conflict with more modern understandings of how we should treat our fellow human beings. However, as an early American writer, Knight's writings offer scholars a view into the controversial complexities of eighteenth-century life.

Main bearings are usually plain bearings or journal bearings, held in place by the engine block and bearing caps. The number of main bearings per engine varies between engines, often in accordance with the forces produced by the operation of the engine.  Number of main bearings  The number of main bearings is primarily determined by the overall load factor and maximum engine speed. Increasing the number of bearings in an engine will generally increase the size and cost of the engine, but also reduces bending stress and deflection caused by the distance from the crank pins to the nearest bearings. The number of bearings and crank pins can also have an effect on engine balance; a more stable crankshaft will better avoid unbalance from flexing, but increasing the crankshaft length or girth to accommodate an additional bearing increases the rotational inertia of the crankshaft, which can have the opposite effect. Most engines have at least two main bearings— one at each end of the crankshaft. Additional bearing may be located along the crankshaft, sometimes as many as one bearing per crank pin, as used on many modern diesel engines and petrol engines designed for high RPM. Some small single-cylinder engines have only one main bearing, in which case it must withstand the bending moment created by the offset distance from the connecting rod to the main bearing. When describing a crankshaft design, the number of main bearings is generally quoted, as the number of crank pins is determined by the cylinder layout. For example, the Toyota VZ V6 engine is described as having a \\"four bearing crankshaft\\" and the Jaguar XK6 straight-six engine has a \\"seven bearing crankshaft\\".  Bearing caps  The lower half of the main bearings are typically held in place by 'bearing caps' which are secured to the engine block using bolts. The basic arrangement is for each bearing cap to have two bolts, but some engines may have four or six bolts per bearing cap (often referred to as \\"four-bolt mains\\" or \\"six-bolt mains\\" engines). The additional bolts result in increased strength, allowing the engine to withstand higher power output or RPM. However, the additional holes required for four- or six- bolt main bearings can increase the chance of hairline fractures developing in the engine block. The first car engine to use four-bolt main bearings was the V12 Maybach Zeppelin of 1928, that used them on three of its eight main bearings. The typical design for a six-bolt main bearing (as used by the General Motors LS engine and Ford Modular engine) is four vertical bolts (two on each side of the crankshaft) from the bottom extending into the block and two lateral cross-bolts coming from the left and right side pan rails into the side of the main caps to provide additional lateral strength.

Other KZZP DJs include Lady La, Nick Wize, Ashley and Brett Andrews. History =Early Years= The station first signed on the air in 1950 as KTYL-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1951 page 73 It was the FM counterpart to KTYL in Mesa (now KIHP). The two stations simulcast their programming and were owned by Sun Valley Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Harkins Theatres, a movie theater chain. In 1953, a television station was added, NBC affiliate KTYL-TV (now KPNX). (The KTYL-FM call sign is now used by a station in Tyler, Texas.) In 1958, the radio stations were acquired by Greater Phoenix Broadcasting, under Sherwood R. Gordon, president.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-111 The following year, the stations switched call letters to KBUZ-AM-FM with a beautiful music format. In late 1976, the stations were sold to Southwestern Media, Inc., with the FM splitting from the AM Simulcast on 1/1/1977, changing call letters to KIOG (on air ID was K104-FM) and aired a soft rock syndicated format from TM Programming in Dallas called \\"Beautiful Rock\\", originating from studios located at the Thomas Mall in Phoenix. =Top 40 KZZP= Western Cities Broadcasting purchased KIOG in 1980, along with its co-owned AM station. Both stations changed to a Top 40 format as KZZP-AM-FM. During those days, the station was known as \\"104.7 KZZP.\\" Morning host Jonathon Brandmeier, also known as Johnny B., later became a star in The Windy City at WLUP-FM in Chicago. While in Phoenix, his KZZP show featured prank phone calls, parody songs which Brandmeier himself usually wrote, sang and recorded, along with a cast of regular characters. When Brandmeier left for Chicago, Western Cities won an injunction to keep him off the air in that market until his contract with KZZP had expired. In 1991, Brandmeier hosted a national late night TV show, \\"Johnny B. on the Loose,\\" syndicated by Viacom. KZZP, also known as \\"Hitmusic 104\\" or \\"FM 104\\" in the 1980s, was considered one of America's leading Top 40 radio stations. It was led by Program Director Guy Zapoleon, and owned by Nationwide Communications. During Zapoleon's era, the station played mass appeal hits along with some adventurous dance and alternative releases. Zapoleon hired morning man Bruce Kelly from Boston in July 1985. The station also had popular DJs including Valerie Knight, Kevin Weatherly, Jimmy Kimmel, Dave Otto, Kevin Ryder and Gene Baxter (of Kevin and Bean fame), Todd Fisher, Clarke Ingram, John Machay, Nick Sommers, Michelle Santosuosso, William \\"Bill Stu\\" Stewart, Carey Edwards, Steve Goddard, Kent Voss, William \\"Buddy\\" LaTour, Mike Elliot, John O'Rourke, Steve Grosz, Susan Karis, Dave Ryan, Laurie Michaels and Brody Scott. In December 1989, Bruce Kelly signed a lucrative five-year contract with the station, but was released just weeks later. Kelly sued for wrongful termination and won. Years later, Kelly went to KKFR and teamed with former WLUP Chicago DJ Maggie Brock to host \\"Bruce & Maggie in the Morning.\\" =KVRY (1991–96)= On April 28, 1991, at 1 p.m., after playing \\"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\" by Elton John, KZZP began stunting with a ticking clock. Two days later, on April 30, KZZP changed to Hot Adult Contemporary, branded as \\"Variety 104.7.\\" The KZZP call letters were retired for KVRY at the time of the change. The first song on \\"Variety\\" was \\"Roll with It\\" by Steve Winwood. \\"Variety\\" was led by Program Director Stef Rybak and Assistant PD/Music Director Jon Zellner, who also hosted afternoon drive.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1991/RR-1991-05-03.pdf =Return to KZZP (1996–2001)= On March 8, 1996, at 3 p.m., after six hours of stunting with heartbeat sound effects and clips from the television show ER, KZZP returned to Phoenix, this time featuring a Modern AC format, and the \\"104.7 KZZP\\" name, making an attempt to capture the audience that grew up listening to the original incarnation. The first song on the relaunched KZZP was \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" by The Cure.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-03-15.pdf; Brandmeier made a brief return, via syndication, in mornings, in 1996, but ratings were not strong, and after six months, he was replaced with a local morning show. The station returned to #1 in the ratings for a couple of periods during this time. Jacor bought Nationwide's radio stations, including KZZP, in 1997. Bruce Kelly returned in August 1998 for a brief run in mornings. The new Modern AC KZZP was competing with the similarly-formatted KMXP, and would later become its sister station with the merger of Jacor and Nationwide. KMXP had the better ratings so, in February 1999, KZZP began evolving back to Mainstream Top 40 by including more rhythmic and upbeat tracks in its playlist; the shift was completed that April. In June 1999, KZZP rebranded as \\"104-7 'ZZP - Arizona's Hit Music Channel.\\" The station made even more changes, including in its air staff and playlist. The station briefly aired Los Angeles-based Rick Dees in syndication for a few months in 2000. With all of these changes, however, KZZP was usually ranked in the mid-2 to low-3 share range of the radio market. =104.7 KISS-FM (2001–present)= On April 20, 2001, at 6 p.m., after playing \\"Higher\\" by Creed, KZZP began stunting with a 3-day loop of Prince's Kiss. At Noon on April 23, the station relaunched as \\"104.7 KISS-FM.\\" It featured an introduction from Destiny's Child, whose song Survivor was the first song played. By this time, Jacor had been merged into owners, Clear Channel Communications. Many Top 40 stations owned by Clear Channel call themselves KISS-FM, regardless of their actual call sign, including KIIS-FM Los Angeles, KHKS Dallas and WXKS-FM Boston. KZZP, under Clear Channel and Program Director Tom Caloccoci, went in a Rhythmic-leaning Top 40 direction that included some dance crossovers. Although KZZP broadened to include mainstream pop songs by 2004, KZZP's playlist still leaned rhythmic, similar to many Top 40 stations in the Southwest. On September 16, 2014, Clear Channel renamed itself iHeartMedia, to bring its corporate name in line with its iHeartRadio internet platform. Around the same time as the corporate name change, KZZP repositioned to a Mainstream Top 40 direction, along with several other leading rhythmic Top 40 stations, such as KYLD San Francisco, WBBM-FM Chicago and XHITZ San Diego. HD radio KZZP broadcasts in the HD Radio format. The main signal is a simulcast of KZZP's Top 40 programming.

It was the first book published by a black woman from Zimbabwe in English. Nervous Conditions won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize in 1989, and in 2018 was listed as one of the BBC's top 100 books that changed the world. The semi-autobiographical novel\\"Nervous Conditions\\", Colonial and Postcolonial Literary Dialogues, Western Michigan University. focuses on the story of a Shona family in post-colonial Rhodesia during the 1960s. Nervous Conditions is the first book of a trilogy, with The Book of Not (2006) as the second novel in the series, and This Mournable Body (2020) as the third. Nervous Conditions illustrates the dynamic themes of race, colonialism, and gender during the post-colonial conditions of present- day Zimbabwe. The title is taken from the introduction by Jean-Paul Sartre to Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth (1961).  Plot summary  Tambu is the main character of the novel. The novel opens up with the news that Tambu’s older brother, Nhamo, had just died. Tambu is not upset about this because Nhamo studied at a missionary school away from home with his uncle Babamukuru and his family. The only thing Tambu desires is to attend school, but her family is very poor and do not have enough money to pay her school fees. Tambu’s uncle, Babamukuru, and his family came to visit the homestead. Because of Babamakuru’s success, he is worshiped whenever he comes to visit. During the visit, Babamukuru suggests that Tambu should take Nhamo's place and attend the missionary school by his house. Upon arriving, she soon becomes close to her cousin Nyasha and completely focuses on her studies. During term break, everyone returns to visit the family back in the homestead. Tambu does not want to go back as she is much more comfortable living with Babamukuru. Towards the end of the term, there is an exam administered at Tambu’s school. This exam is to test the students and offer them an opportunity to study at a well known missionary school. Tambu excels on the exam and is offered a scholarship to attend this well known school. In the new school Tambu is introduced to many cultural changes; however, she remains resistant to the changes. As always she is fully focused on her studies. Consequently, she remains cautious of her daily situations and nervous of the conditions that surround her.  Characters  *Tambu: Jeremiah and Mainini's daughter. Tambu is the novel's main character and narrator of the story. Her desire for an education and to improve herself seem strong enough to overcome just about anything. She is very hard on herself, and always strives to do her best and make the correct decisions. *Nyasha: Tambu's first cousin, Babamukuru and Maiguru's daughter. Her desire to be independent gets her into a lot of trouble, including numerous arguments with her father. Her time in England showed her a different life, and she is having trouble assimilating back into Rhodesian society, suffering from some kind of eating disorder. *Babamukuru: Tambu's uncle, and the head of her family. He is married to Maiguru and has a daughter, Nyasha. His actual name is never mentioned in the novel; he is only referred to by clan names in the Shona language. Tambu always calls him \\"Babamukuru\\", which means \\"father's older brother\\"; Tambu's father's generation call him \\"Mukoma\\", which means \\"oldest brother\\". A well-educated man, he is the dean of the missionary school. As head of the family, he feels responsible for the rest of his extended family; he also regards them as insufficiently hard-working, which makes him rather authoritarian towards them. By contrast, he shows subservience to the people who helped him get his education. *Maiguru: Nyasha's mother. Maiguru is a well-educated woman who is forced to be reliant on her husband, Babamukuru. She is frustrated because while she has the potential to provide for herself, she is prevented from doing so by patriarchial forces. *Chido: Babamukuru and Maiguru's son. Because Chido is Babamukuru's son, he received a good education, but he succumbed to the customs of the white colonists. *Jeremiah: Babamukuru's brother and Tambu's father. Jeremiah received very little education and is barely able to provide for his family. He acts grateful to Babamukuru for the education he provided his children with. *Lucia: Mainini's sister. Lucia stays relatively unknown during the course of the novel. She is believed to have had many affairs with wealthy men. She is a very independent woman, and is determined to educate herself and not fall into the normal roles of women in her society. *Mainini: Tambu's mother. After Nhamo's death, when Tambu goes to the mission, she becomes very resentful of Babamukuru for taking another one of her children to his school. *Nhamo: Tambu's brother. As the eldest son in the family, Nhamo is chosen to go to the mission school. After being at the school, he feels he is superior to the rest of his family, and takes no part in their daily tasks. Eventually, he starts going home from the mission less and less until his death. Major themes Gender Gender is one major theme expressed in the novel. The Rhodesian female characters are oppressed on the basis of gender, and this is a driving force behind many of the story arcs in the novel. Colonialism Colonialism is another major theme in the novel - it is another driving force behind many of the plot points, including the fixation on (Western) education and Nyasha's internal struggles with race and colonialism. Additionally, Tambu's trajectory starting with her early education and ending with her acceptance at the nun's school reveals the colonial nature of that scholarship, since the African students were not treated the same as the white Western students.  Reception  Nervous Conditions has mostly received positive reviews, making it a prominent African and Zimbabwean literary work. The Africa Book Club recommends Nervous Conditions, claiming Dangarembga’s work to be, \\"a thought-provoking novel that packs a huge number of complicated ideas into a simple and engaging story.\\"Sarah Norman, \\"Nervous Conditions (by Tsitsi Dangarembga)\\", Africa Book Club, 3 September 2011. Nervous Conditions was awarded the Commonwealth Writers' Prize in 1989, and has since been translated into a number of languages. It has been praised both within and outside of Africa as a prominent contribution and advocate of African feminism and post-colonialism. The novel has been described as an \\"absorbing page-turner\\" by The Bloomsbury Review, \\"another example of a bold new national literature\\" by the African Times and \\"a unique and valuable book\\" by Booklist. Finally, Pauline Uwakweh describes how Nervous Conditions emphasizes that \\"[Racial and colonial problems are explored] as parallel themes to patriarchal dominance because both are doubtless interrelated forms of dominance over a subordinate social group. Dangarembga has, indeed, demonstrated a keen knowledge of the problems of her Rhodesian society in particular, and Africa in general. Her vision as a writer stresses that awareness and courage are the blueprint to exploding its contradictions.\\" Overall, Nervous Conditions is recognized as a major literary contribution to African feminism and postcolonial literature. In May 2018, the BBC named Nervous Conditions as one of the top 100 books that have shaped the world. The novel was the 66th book on the list.

See M. Douglas, \\"The statistics of string / M theory vacua\\", JHEP 0305, 46 (2003). ; S. Ashok and M. Douglas, \\"Counting flux vacua\\", JHEP 0401, 060 (2004). together comprising a collective \\"landscape\\" of choices of parameters governing compactifications. The term \\"landscape\\" comes from the notion of a fitness landscape in evolutionary biology. It was first applied to cosmology by Lee Smolin in his book The Life of the Cosmos (1997), and was first used in the context of string theory by Leonard Susskind.L. Smolin, \\"Did the universe evolve?\\", Classical and Quantum Gravity 9, 173–191 (1992). L. Smolin, The Life of the Cosmos (Oxford, 1997) Compactified Calabi–Yau manifolds In string theory the number of flux vacua is thought to be at least 10^{272,000}. The large number of possibilities arises from choices of Calabi–Yau manifolds and choices of generalized magnetic fluxes over various homology cycles, found in F-theory. If there is no structure in the space of vacua, the problem of finding one with a sufficiently small cosmological constant is NP complete. This is a version of the subset sum problem. A possible mechanism of string theory vacuum stabilization, now known as the KKLT mechanism, was proposed in 2003 by Shamit Kachru, Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde, and Sandip Trivedi. Fine-tuning by the anthropic principle Fine-tuning of constants like the cosmological constant or the Higgs boson mass are usually assumed to occur for precise physical reasons as opposed to taking their particular values at random. That is, these values should be uniquely consistent with underlying physical laws. The number of theoretically allowed configurations has prompted suggestions that this is not the case, and that many different vacua are physically realized.L. Susskind, \\"The anthropic landscape of string theory\\", . The anthropic principle proposes that fundamental constants may have the values they have because such values are necessary for life (and hence intelligent observers to measure the constants). The anthropic landscape thus refers to the collection of those portions of the landscape that are suitable for supporting intelligent life. In order to implement this idea in a concrete physical theory, it is necessary to postulate a multiverse in which fundamental physical parameters can take different values. This has been realized in the context of eternal inflation. =Weinberg model= In 1987, Steven Weinberg proposed that the observed value of the cosmological constant was so small because it is impossible for life to occur in a universe with a much larger cosmological constant.S. Weinberg, \\"Anthropic bound on the cosmological constant\\", Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 2607 (1987). Weinberg attempted to predict the magnitude of the cosmological constant based on probabilistic arguments. Other attempts have been made to apply similar reasoning to models of particle physics.S. M. Carroll, \\"Is our universe natural?\\" (2005) reviews a number of proposals in preprints dated 2004/5. Such attempts are based in the general ideas of Bayesian probability; interpreting probability in a context where it is only possible to draw one sample from a distribution is problematic in frequentist probability but not in Bayesian probability, which is not defined in terms of the frequency of repeated events. In such a framework, the probability P(x) of observing some fundamental parameters x is given by, :P(x)=P_{mathrm{prior}}(x)times P_{mathrm{selection}}(x), where P_mathrm{prior} is the prior probability, from fundamental theory, of the parameters x and P_mathrm{selection} is the \\"anthropic selection function\\", determined by the number of \\"observers\\" that would occur in the universe with parameters x. These probabilistic arguments are the most controversial aspect of the landscape. Technical criticisms of these proposals have pointed out that: * The function P_mathrm{prior} is completely unknown in string theory and may be impossible to define or interpret in any sensible probabilistic way. * The function P_mathrm{selection} is completely unknown, since so little is known about the origin of life. Simplified criteria (such as the number of galaxies) must be used as a proxy for the number of observers. Moreover, it may never be possible to compute it for parameters radically different from those of the observable universe. =Simplified approaches= Tegmark et al. have recently considered these objections and proposed a simplified anthropic scenario for axion dark matter in which they argue that the first two of these problems do not apply.M. Tegmark, A. Aguirre, M. Rees and F. Wilczek, \\"Dimensionless constants, cosmology and other dark matters\\", . F. Wilczek, \\"Enlightenment, knowledge, ignorance, temptation\\", . See also the discussion at . Vilenkin and collaborators have proposed a consistent way to define the probabilities for a given vacuum.See, e.g. A problem with many of the simplified approaches people have tried is that they \\"predict\\" a cosmological constant that is too large by a factor of 10–1000 orders of magnitude (depending on one's assumptions) and hence suggest that the cosmic acceleration should be much more rapid than is observed. =Interpretation= Few dispute the large number of metastable vacua. The existence, meaning, and scientific relevance of the anthropic landscape, however, remain controversial. Cosmological constant problem Andrei Linde, Sir Martin Rees and Leonard Susskind advocate it as a solution to the cosmological- constant problem. Scientific relevance David Gross suggests that the idea is inherently unscientific, unfalsifiable or premature. A famous debate on the anthropic landscape of string theory is the Smolin–Susskind debate on the merits of the landscape. Popular reception There are several popular books about the anthropic principle in cosmology.L. Susskind, The cosmic landscape: string theory and the illusion of intelligent design (Little, Brown, 2005). M. J. Rees, Just six numbers: the deep forces that shape the universe (Basic Books, 2001). R. Bousso and J. Polchinski, \\"The string theory landscape\\", Sci. Am. 291, 60–69 (2004). The authors of two physics blogs, Lubos Motl and Peter Woit, are opposed to this use of the anthropic principle.Motl's blog criticized the anthropic principle and Woit's blog frequently attacks the anthropic string landscape.

It was originally designated in 1929. It is mostly a controlled-access freeway, linking Lawrence to Lenexa. It provides an important toll-free alternate route to Interstate 70 (the Kansas Turnpike). Several scenes for the TV-movie The Day After were filmed on the highway at De Soto in 1982 portraying a mass exodus evacuating the Kansas City area on I-70. Route description K-10 westbound in De Soto The highway's western end begins as a two-lane highway at I-70 exit 197, just west of Lawrence. It bypasses the city to the south, providing access to Clinton Lake, and also intersects with U.S. Route 59, beginning a four lane freeway after the interchange. K-10 continues to the northeast on the new South Lawrence Trafficway (completed 2016) before interchanging with 23rd Street (Old K-10). After exiting Lawrence eastbound, it passes through the city of Eudora, and then the cities of De Soto and Olathe, suburbs of Kansas City. It then terminates at an interchange with Interstate 435 and Interstate 35 in Lenexa. In Johnson County, the road is called the Governor John Anderson, Jr. Highway. History K-10 originally extended west of Lawrence to Herington, via Alta Vista, Alma, and Topeka. In 1956 the portion between Topeka and K-99 near Alma was designated as US-40 in preparation for upgrading this stretch to Interstate standards (for I-70). The segment between Alta Vista and Herington was redesignated as K-4 and K-10 was truncated eastward to Lawrence. The process of upgrading K-10 to a freeway was begun in 1974. The first section completed was the section from De Soto to the junction with K-7, opening on November 8, 1976. The freeway was finally completed on December 18, 1984, when the stretch from K-7 to I-435 was completed. The old two-lane roadbed of K-10 was turned over to the counties to use as a secondary route. In Douglas County it became CR 442, although many of the locals, especially in Eudora, commonly refer to it as Old K-10. The portion of K-10 between the Edgerton Road exit and the De Soto interchange at former K-285 (now Lexington Avenue) was used in the movie The Day After and, for the purposes of the film, was temporarily redesignated Interstate 70. =South Lawrence Trafficway= In the early 1970s traffic studies of K-10 determined a bypass around the west and south sides of Lawrence was necessary, and the Kansas Department of Transportation commenced due diligence on the bypass project. The bypass on the west side of Lawrence was completed in November 1996. Prior to the opening of the trafficway, K-10 had ended at the junction of US-40 and US-59 in Lawrence. Completion of the eastern leg of the trafficway was delayed for nearly three decades by lawsuits from environmentalist groups and Haskell University, as the planned route took the highway through the Haskell-Baker Wetlands. In October 2012, the deadline for the plaintiffs of the lawsuits to seek a Supreme Court review of the case passed, and a mitigation plan for the wetlands was added to the trafficway plans. Construction began on November 12, 2013, and was anticipated to be completed by Fall 2016 before Thanksgiving. The ribbon cutting ceremony for the trafficway was held on November 4, 2016, and in attendance were many local and state leaders including Governor Sam Brownback and Senator Pat Roberts. The trafficway officially opened to all traffic on November 9, 2016. Future In Spring 2020, KDOT announced it was evaluating three alternatives to reconstruct the interchange with K-10 and I-70, and to add a grade separated interchange to the K-10 / Wakarusa Drive intersection. The preferred alternative will be identified in the Fall of 2020.

Thomason, widow of Colonel Thomason; and commissioned on 11 October 1945, Commander W. L. Tagg in command. Service history The new destroyer conducted shakedown training out of San Diego, followed by a series of Naval Reserve training cruises from Seattle and San Francisco. From November 1947 to December 1948 the ship carried out training maneuvers. She sailed on 5 December 1948 for her first deployment to the Far East, arriving at Tsingtao on 1 January 1949 for operations supporting the Marines ashore in China. Departing 24 May 1949, John W. Thomason returned via Okinawa to San Diego on 23 June 1949 and spent the remainder of the year training. =Korea= The ship returned to the Far East in early 1950, arriving at Yokosuka on 29 January. During this critical post-war period, she operated with British ships on training maneuvers off the coast of Indochina and Korea, returning to San Diego 25 April 1950. Two months later, North Korean aggression plunged the United States and the United Nations into the Korean War. Under the command of Gordon Chung-Hoon, John W. Thomason sailed on 30 September to join the 7th Fleet, operating in the screen of carrier task groups attacking enemy positions and supply lines. She arrived at Wonsan on 9 November to patrol and bombard during the campaign against that port. Antisubmarine exercises took her to Pearl Harbor from January–March 1951, but John W. Thomason arrived off Korea again on 26 March to operate with and during air strikes. Two weeks in April were spent on the important Formosa Patrol, after which she returned to the carrier task force. With battleship and another destroyer, she moved close in 24 May 1951 for gun bombardment of Yang Yang. The destroyer returned to San Diego from this deployment 2 July 1951. John W. Thomason sailed again for Korea on 4 January 1952 and resumed operations with Task Force 77 off the coast of North Korea. She fired at railway targets 21 February in the Songjin area. During this period of stalemate on land, Navy strikes made up the bulk of offensive operations. The destroyer returned to Formosa Patrol duty in April. Back at Songjin and Wonsan on 26 April, the ship screened larger units, took part in shore bombardment, and patrolled offshore. She was relieved by a British destroyer on 21 June and returned to San Diego on 11 July 1952. The destroyer operated off the California coast for the remainder of 1952, then sailed once more for Korea 21 February 1953. Formosa Patrol duty alternated with carrier task force operations off North Korea. John W. Thomason arrived at Wonsan harbor on 2 July; while firing at shore targets five days later, she received numerous shrapnel hits in a duel with enemy batteries. Maneuvering in the restricted waters, Commander Ratliff returned the fire until three batteries had been silenced. She continued to operate off Wonsan until the armistice on 27 July, and after a brief stay in Japan arrived at San Diego on 22 September 1953. =1954-1963= From 1954-1956 John W. Thomason returned to the now-familiar waters off Korea and in the Formosa Strait, serving with the 7th Fleet. The first half of 1957 was spent in readiness exercises off San Diego. John W. Thomason then sailed on 29 July for a cruise which took her to Pago Pago, Auckland, and Manus. Upon arrival at Yokosuka on 7 September 1957 she resumed operations in the Formosa Straits and antisubmarine exercises with 7th Fleet ships. The ship returned to San Diego 8 January 1958, and conducted maneuvers off California and Hawaii. John W. Thomason after her FRAM conversion. In March 1959, John W. Thomason entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard as the prototype ship for the new Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) program. During this extensive repair and modernization period she received a helicopter deck and hangar aft, variable depth sonar, the latest electronic equipment, and many improvements in living and working spaces. The conversion was followed by extensive trials and local training operations. As the new flagship of Destroyer Division 72, she sailed on 8 March 1961 for 7th Fleet duty. After further operation John W. Thomason sailed to San Diego, arriving 18 September 1961. Extensive conversion and installation of new sonar equipment at Long Beach occupied the ship until July 1962. In December she took part in a massive antiaircraft exercise with units of the 1st Fleet off California. She sailed again for the Far East, a part of the ready-hunter- killer group. En route, however, she took part in recovery operations for Project Mercury as part of a task unit built around the aircraft carrier . During the cruise which followed, the ship trained in her antisubmarine warfare (ASW) tactics and became familiar with her new equipment in operations with 7th Fleet and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. John W. Thomason returned to San Diego on 3 December 1963. =Vietnam= Most of 1964 was spent in ASW exercises in the Eastern Pacific. On 23 October, she sailed with Destroyer Division 213 for redeployment exercises in Hawaii. Exactly a month later, with four other destroyers, she got under way for the western Pacific screening and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan on 4 December, joining the 7th Fleet. In the spring she earned her first battle star for operating in the troubled waters off the coast of Indochina from 21 March to 28 April 1965. After returning to the West Coast, she departed San Diego for the Far East 22 March 1966 and reached Da Nang 19 April and the same day took station a few miles south of Chu Lai. At the end of April she supported Operation Osage, and landed north of Da Nang. On 13 May she sailed for Sasebo and upkeep. Back in the war zone 6 June, she provided gunfire support and supported Operation Deckhouse 1 from 17 to 23 June. That day she retired toward Hong Kong. The destroyer returned to gunfire support duties off South Vietnam 16 August. From 18 to 23 August she supported the amphibious Ready Group and Special Landing Force in Operation \\"Deckhouse III.\\" After visiting Guam and Japan, John W. Thomason headed home on 9 September, reached San Diego on 24 August and operated off the West Coast into 1967. John W. Thomasons 1969 deployment was preceded by a most strenuous overhaul, refresher training, and a multitude of inspections. No sooner had the destroyer and her task group joined the 7th Fleet than the first of more than fifteen schedule changes was received. The ship was diverted to Subic Bay before sailing to the Tonkin Gulf for planeguard duties with . The first major inport period was in Kaohsiung, Taiwan after which John W. Thomason returned to Yankee Station. Three weeks of uneventful plane guarding were followed by a week in Bangkok. Subic Bay followed and another upkeep period. This one was cut short by a call for gunfire support in UV Corps near Vung Tau. After several days along the coast, the destroyer navigated the Nha Be River to participate in gunfire support in the Rung Sat Special Zone. Completing a week’s duty as part of the naval gunfire support team, the ship returned to her plane guard duties in the Tonkin Gulf, this time for . During this period of duty, the destroyer rescued the crew from a crashed helicopter from Bon Homme Richard. Six days of leave in Hong Kong and an upkeep period in Sasebo, Japan, followed. John W. Thomason then returned to Yankee Station and provided plane guard services for . John W. Thomason escorted Hancock to Subic Bay and back to Yankee Station before rejoining Bon Homme Richard in this last line period. On the return home, stops were made in Subic Bay and Yokosuka. The weather demonstrated its capabilities at an inopportune time and delayed the destroyer's return to San Diego until 29 October 1969. John W. Thomason received seven battle stars for Korean service and three for Vietnam service.  References  *  External links  * navsource.org: USS John W. Thomason * hazegray.org: USS John W.

Watson has also worked for more mainstream American comic publishers including DC Comics, a twelve-issue limited series at Marvel Comics, several series for Dark Horse Comics, and Image Comics. He is currently writing and drawing children's books, notably the \\"Gum Girl\\" series. Biography Andi Watson was born in the Wakefield Infirmary and raised in Kippax, West Yorkshire by working-class parents. He studied foundation art at Dewsbury college followed by a graphic design / illustration course at Liverpool Polytechnic (now Liverpool John Moores University). He currently lives in Worcester. =Early works= For his final degree show Watson produced the small press comic Samurai Jam along with T-shirts and bubble-gum cards. The comic was rooted in skateboarding and punk rock culture and artistically influenced by Japanese Manga, specifically Akira, and the American alternative comic Love and Rockets. Three issues were produced by 1993, photocopied with covers spray-painted with a stencil, which generated some interest within the British small press comics scene. Watson approached various American publishers and was taken on by Dan Vado of Slave Labor Graphics in 1993 who published four issues of Samurai Jam. These were not a success, due in part to the wildly different art styles Watson employed with each issue, but Vado kept the door open and Watson returned in 1995 with Skeleton Key, a monthly 16-page comic that ran for 30 issues and cemented his reputation. After Skeleton Key Watson moved to Oni Press with Geisha, a graphic novel about a robot girl artist. Rather than approach the issue of her being a robot Watson used the story to examine the ideas of fake and real. The book was an artistic bridge for Watson between the manga-inspired Skeleton Key and his current, more European, style. =Later works= The Geisha one-shot comic marked a dramatic shift in Watson's style, bringing in stylistic influences from European creators such as François Avril and Dupuy and Berberian, but retaining the slow pacing of long-form Manga. This came to fruition with Breakfast After Noon, a \\"slice of life\\" story set in the industrial city of Stoke-on-Trent in Britain. This was followed by the novella Dumped, a love story produced in association with the BIG festival in Turin. Watson returned to Slave Labor in 2002 with Slow News Day, a graphic novel set around a small town British newspaper which dealt with English attitudes to Americans and the theme of big versus small audience. He followed that with a one-shot featuring the fox spirit Kitsune from his earlier series Skeleton Key, this time in a tale set in medieval Japan, scripted by Woodrow Phoenix. He then created twelve issues of a romantic comedy series Love Fights published by Oni and followed that with Paris, a limited series for Slave Labor scripted by Watson with art by Simon Gane. Recent solo work by Watson has been all-ages stories targeted at children/young adults. GlisterAndi Watson on Glister , Newsarama, 25 May 2007 is about the adventures of Glister Butterworth – girl-magnet for the weird and unusual who lives at Chilblain Hall. In Princess at Midnight, Holly Crescent leads a sheltered life as a home-schooled girl by day. By night she's Princess of Castle Waxing where she wages a perilous turf war with the Horrible Horde. Both series were published by Image Comics. Both series have since been republished. Glister was published in the UK in an altered, expanded form as a four-book series by Walker Books. Princess at Midnight is currently being serialised online. Gum Girl, Watson's current work, features stories about a girl called Grace Gibson, who is a young superhero fighting strange villains in the town of Catastrophe. The four books in this series are published by Walker Books. =Work for hire= Andi Watson has worked as the writer on a variety of licensed properties, most significantly a 2-year run on the first Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics from Dark Horse Comics and Marvel Comics' Namor.

Tōyama was a strong advocate of Pan Asianism (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere). Early life Tōyama was born to a poor samurai family in Fukuoka City in Kyūshū. In his youth, he fought in the Saga Rebellion of 1874. In 1881, Tōyama became one of the founders of the Genyosha, a secret society and terrorist organization whose agenda was to agitate for Japanese military expansion and conquest of the Asian continent. The society attracted disaffected ex-samurai, and also figures involved in organized crime to assist in its campaigns of violence and assassination against foreigners and left-wing politicians. In 1889, Tōyama and the Genyosha were implicated in the attempted assassination of foreign minister Ōkuma Shigenobu. Covert government cooperation Tōyama (left) with his friends, future Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai (center), future President of Republic of China Chiang Kai- shek (right) and others in 1929 Tōyama was both a founder and one-time head of the Black Dragon Society. Immediately prior to the start of the First Sino- Japanese War, Tōyama organized the Tenyukyo, a secret society and paramilitary force that operated in Korea prior to the arrival of the Imperial Japanese Army, making detailed topographic maps, scouting out Chinese and Korean military installations and deployment, and arranging for logistic support. Along with Genyosha operatives in Korea and Manchuria, the Tenyukyo provided interpreters and guides to the regular Japanese army after their invasion. Tōyama was a strong supporter of Japanese control over Manchuria, and joined forces with the anti-Russian Tairo Doshikai movement in 1903. He also supported the Chinese republican revolutionaries against the Qing dynasty and gave considerable support to Sun Yat-sen. When the Chinese revolution began in 1911, he went to China in person as an advisor and to personally oversee Genyosha activities and to provide assistance to Sun Yat-sen. Following the Chinese revolution, Tōyama officially retired, and apparently refused to play an active role in the Black Dragon Society (Kokuryu-Kai) that he helped create as a successor to the Genyosha. He remained an influential behind-the-scenes figure in Japanese politics during the following years. Influence in nationalist Japan In the 1930s, he was considered as a superpatriot by a large section of the Japanese public, including the military. In 1932, after the assassination of several \\"liberal\\" political figures, and following rumors that then Premier Saito and others were to be assassinated in turn, the government had Tōyama's house raided and searched, and his son arrested - leading to a momentary pacification of the situation.Joseph C. Grew, Ten years in Japan p 69 ASIN: B0006ER51M Legacy Grave of Toyama Mitsuru in Fukuoka Grave of Toyama Mitsuru and his wife in Tokyo Although Tōyama remained a private citizen all his life, he was known as the \\"Shadow Shogun,\\" \\"Spymaster,\\" and \\"The Boss of Bosses,\\" because of his tremendous covert influence on the nationalist politics and the yakuza crime syndicates. He also wrote an influential book on the \\"Three Shu\\" (Katsu Kaishu, Takahashi Deishu, and Yamaoka Tesshu). Despite his ultranationalism, Tōyama was paradoxically on good terms with Onisaburo Deguchi, Japan's most fervent pacifist. Tōyama was charismatic, complex, and controversial figure in his lifetime, and remains so to this day. He died in 1944 at his summer home on Gotemba, Shizuoka Prefecture, at the base of Mount Fuji. Radio Tokyo announced that funeral services lasting more than three hours were held for him in Tokyo.Associated Press, \\"State Funeral Given Black Dragon Chief\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Thursday 12 October 1944, Volume 51, page 11.

The temple originally belonged to the Tendai sect of Buddhism, but eventually became an independent temple of the Jōdo-shū.English language pamphlet from Kaikozan Hasedera History Legend has it that the temple was established in the Tenpyō era (729-749 C.E.). However, documents at the temple suggest that the temple really came into its own during the Kamakura period (1192-1333). Statue The main statue of Kannon is one of the largest wooden statues in Japan, with a height of , and is made from camphor wood and gilded in gold. It has 11 heads, each of which represents a different phase in the search for enlightenment. According to legend, the statue is one of two images of Kannon carved by a monk named Tokudō in 721. The camphor tree was so large, according to legend, that he decided that he could carve two statues with it. One was enshrined in Hase-dera in the city of Nara, Yamato Province, while the other was set adrift in the sea to find the place with which it had a karmic connection. The statue washed ashore on Nagai Beach on the Miura Peninsula near Kamakura in the year 736. The statue was immediately brought to Kamakura where a temple was built to honor it. Temple buildings The temple sits about half-way up Mount Kamakura, southwest of the city of Kamakura. The temple commands an impressive view over Yuigahama. Seven buildings make up the temple complex. Temple grounds The temple is built on two levels and also includes a cave. The cave, called benten kutsu (Benzaiten Grotto), contains a long winding tunnel with a low ceiling and various statues and devotionals to Benzaiten, the sea goddess and the only female of the Seven Lucky Gods in Japanese mythology. The temple is famous for its hydrangeas, which bloom along the Hydrangea Path in June and July. Jizō statues at Jizō-Do The grounds of the temple are home to hundreds of small Jizō statues, placed by parents mourning offspring lost to miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion. These statues remain in place for about a year, before being removed to make way for more statues; it is estimated that some 50,000 Jizō statues have been placed at Hase-dera since World War II.http://www.sacred- destinations.com/japan/kamakura-hasedera Pilgrimage routes The temple is the fourth of the 33 stations of two different pilgrimage routes: 1) Bandō Sanjūsankasho pilgrimage circuit dedicated to the goddess Benzaiten. 2) Kantō Pilgrimage.Kannon - Goddess of Mercy--Pilgrimage in Japan  Gallery  File:Sammon main gate.jpgSanmon (main gate) File:Amido-do hall.JPGAmida-do File:Shoro Belfry in Hase-dera.JPGShōrō (belfry) File:KakigaraInari shrine.JPGKakigara-Inari File:View over Kamakura bay.JPGView over Kamakura's Sagami Bay File:Benten-do Hall.JPGKyōzō (Sutra Archive) File:Daikoku-do Hall.JPGDaikoku-do File:Hasedera kannon, 10.JPGGuanyin  Benten-Kutsu Cave  File:Hase-dera_cave.jpgEntrance to the cave File:Benten-Kutsu statue 01.JPGStatues of Benten File:Benten-Kutsu statue 02.JPGBas-relief of Daikoku-ten File:Benten-Kutsu statue 03.JPGBas-relief of Gyūba-dōji File:Benten-Kutsu statue 04.JPGDifferent Buddhist deities File:Hasedera kannon, grotta 05.JPGBenzaiten  See also  * For an explanation of terms concerning Japanese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhist art, and Japanese Buddhist temple architecture, see the Glossary of Japanese Buddhism.

The presence of this hydrophobic compound causes the grains of sand to adhere to one another and form cylinders (to minimize surface area) when exposed to water. When the sand is removed from water, it is completely dry and free flowing. Magic sand is also known as Aqua Sand. Trimethylsilanol These properties are achieved with ordinary beach sand, which contains tiny particles of pure silica, and exposing it to vapors of trimethylsilanol (CH3)3SiOH, an organosilicon compound. Upon exposure, the trimethylsilane compound bonds to the silica particles while forming water. The exteriors of the sand grains are thus coated with hydrophobic groups. Magic sand was originally developed to trap ocean oil spills near the shore. This would be done by sprinkling magic sand on floating petroleum, which would then mix with the oil and make it heavy enough to sink. Due to the expense of production, it is not being used for this purpose. It has also been tested by utility companies in Arctic regions as a foundation for junction boxes, as it never freezes. It can be also used as an aerating medium for potted plants. Magic sand is made in blue, green, or red in colors but appears silvery in water because of a layer of air that forms around the sand, making it unable to get wet. The earliest reference to waterproof sand is in the 1915 book The Boy Mechanic Book 2 published by Popular Mechanics. The Boy Mechanic states waterproof sand was invented by East Indian magicians. The sand was made by mixing heated sand with melted wax. The wax would repel water when the sand was exposed to water.''

As of 15 May 2008, it is unclear whether Mr Schreier has control over the domains in question, nor whether this would breach the DotAsia contract or any laws for countries that the TLD applies to. The 'DotAsia.com Plot' website that makes the allegations, claims to have received correspondence from CEO of DotAsia, Mr Chung, stating that \\"Being a party related to a bidding party, in my understanding, does not automatically create any issue.\\" If there is such an affiliation, it would almost certainly be illegal under Australian competition law (where one of the companies involved, Throne Ventures Pty Ltd, is registered.)the dotasia-complot .Asia responded by releasing a Special Advisory clarifying the rules already in place for addressing conflicts of interest and bid rigging issues and that there is no evidence suggesting that bidders have been advantaged or disadvantaged due to their relationship or non-relationship with Pool.com.Special Advisory on Allegations About DotAsia (and Pool.com) Some of the domains in question: porn.asia; dating.asia; insurance.asia; lotto.asia; stocks.asia; auction.asia; beer.asia; fitness.asia; girls.asia; wine.asia However, all of these domains according to the .ASIA whois service, were awarded during the Sunrise period which means their applications were made with a claim of prior right (registered trademark identical to the domain name). These claims would have been validated by the .ASIA validation partner (there were two, including Deloitte Touche) and where multiple applications were received, the domains would go to auction. The actual auction schedule shows these domains did not go to auction from which it can be concluded there was only a single verified application for the domains in question.  Internationalized domain names  .Asia launched registrations for Chinese, Japanese and Korean Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) registrations (e.g. \\"交易.asia\\", \\"ビデオ.asia\\", \\"게임.asia\\") from May 11 – October 11, 2011. Over 10,000 domains were applied during the Sunrise and Landrush launch..Asia Landrush Launch Chinese, Japanese and Korean .Asia IDN domains started selling on a first-come-first-served basis on June 21, 2012. .Asia plans to launch other Asian language IDN .Asia domains at a later date.  DotAsia Organisation  The DotAsia Organisation, registry operator of the .Asia domain, is a not-for-profit, membership-based organization with a mandate to promote Internet development and adoption in Asia. DotAsia is headquartered in Hong Kong and formed as an open membership consortium of national / official top-level domain authorities around the region (e.g. \\".cn\\" in China, \\".jp\\" in Japan, \\".in\\" in India, \\".sg\\" in Singapore\\", etc.) and regional Internet organizations (e.g. APNIC, APTLD, APIA, etc.).

His sixty-foot pilot schooner, the Sylph, won the first recorded American yacht race in 1832. The town of Belmont, Massachusetts is named after his estate. Early life John Perkins Cushing was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Robert Cushing and his wife Ann Perkins Maynard. His father's Cushing ancestor had emigrated to Hingham, Massachusetts, during the early years of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Cushing's sister, Nancy, later married Henry Higginson (1781-1839). When his mother died of smallpox, Cushing was raised by his uncle, slave and opium trader Thomas Handasyd Perkins (1764–1854). Cushing was reportedly very fond of the Perkins family and very often brought them house-warming gifts such as large boxes of the finest available white sugar. He was said to have spent a lot of time at their house, often playing backgammon with William Appleton or Colonel Perkins. Career In 1803, at age 16, Cushing sailed for China to become clerk in his uncle's counting house. The head of the firm in China soon fell ill and died at sea. Thus, when Cushing arrived in China, he found himself Perkins & Company's sole agent, remaining there for nearly 30 years. Cushing was said to have managed the affairs of the firm skillfully and was soon taken into partnership. Under Cushing, the firm of Perkins & Company was formally established in Canton in 1806. They imported and traded rice during a famine in China and during the War of 1812, the family loaned their money out, at an interest rate of 18 percent, to other merchants in Canton. When the fur trade diminished they began searching for a substitute for what had once been the foundation of Boston's China trade. The firm focused on opium and, by the 1820s, Cushing was known as the most influential of all the foreigners in Canton, having struck up a close relationship with the merchant Howqua, who at his death in 1843 was said to be the richest man in the world. In 1820, Cushing brought on his cousin, Thomas Tunno Forbes, to train for the business. Forbes, however, died in 1827 before assuming control of the firm. Cushing, eager for retirement and lacking a suitable replacement, made arrangements to dissolve Perkins & Company by a consolidation with Russell & Co. in 1830. Russell & Co. had been created by China trader Samuel Russell in 1824. In 1830, Cushing returned to Boston with Eastern manners and manservants. Personal life Shortly after his return to Boston in 1830, he married Mary Louisa Gardiner (1799–1862), the only daughter of the Rev. John Sylvester John Gardiner (1765–1830) of Trinity Church, Boston. It was rumored at the time that there was much disappointment among the young ladies of Boston, who, as someone expressed it, \\"beset him like bumblebees about a lump of sugar.\\" Together, they were the parents of five children, including: * John Gardiner Cushing (1834–1881), who married Susan Prescott Dexter * Robert Maynard Cushing (1836–1907), who married Olivia Donaldson Dulany (1839–1906) * Thomas Forbes Cushing (1838–1902) * William Howard Cushing (d. 1851), who died aged 11. Cushing died in Belmont, Massachusetts on April 12, 1862. His obituary in The New York Times stated that: \\"He was so noted for his liberality to the poor that their pertinacity drove him from Boston, where he once had his residence.\\" =Descendants= Through his eldest son, he was the grandfather of Alice Linzee Cushing (1869–1947). Through his son, Robert, he was the grandfather of Grafton Dulany Cushing (1864–1939), Howard Gardiner Cushing (1869–1916), Olivia Cushing Andersen (1871–1917). His great-grandson was Alexander Cochrane Cushing (1914–2006). =Residence= Cushing built himself a handsome mansion on Summer Street, acquired a splendid estate in Watertown named \\"Bellmont\\" (now part of Belmont, Massachusetts which is named after his estate), and erected one of the finest conservatories in New England. His house was one of the finest and most comfortable of any in or near Boston. It was a double one-—a house within a house-—and thus warm in winter and cool in summer. Its spacious grounds and beautiful gardens were open to the public, and thousands of visitors went out there each year.

Background and artwork After being successful with bands including The Yardbirds, John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, Cream and Blind Faith, Clapton recorded an album under his own name in late 1969 and early 1970. The album cover shows Clapton sitting in a room which is going to be decorated and in which a ladder, a chair and some carpets are placed. Clapton holds a cigarette in his right hand and has his Fender Stratocaster Brownie electric guitar with him. Recording Clapton recorded some tracks in November 1969 at London's Olympic Studios and went on to record more songs in 1970 in two sessions; one in January 1970 at the Village Recorders Studio in West Los Angeles and a second session in March the same year at Island Studios in London. A large number of musicians that worked with Clapton on the album had been working with the band Delaney & Bonnie, which previously opened the Blind Faith gigs. The musicians included the core of Derek & the Dominos, including co-creator and co-songwriter Bobby Whitlock, who can be heard on \\"Let It Rain\\". The song \\"Let it Rain\\" had originally been recorded with different lyrics as \\"She Rides\\". Three mixes of the album were done, one by Delaney Bramlett, one by Tom Dowd and one by Clapton himself. The 11-track album, Dowd mix was the one used for the original release. Bramlett's 10-track album mix without \\"Told You For the Last Time,\\" is included in the Deluxe Edition released on CD in 2006.Liner notes, Eric Clapton Deluxe Edition, Scott Schinder, 2006 In an interview from 2006, promoting The Road to Escondido, Clapton recalled that he was very happy making this album and was pleased with the results of the recording sessions, but also noted that \\"the only thing [he] didn't like about the album is [his] voice\\", because it sounds so \\"high\\" and \\"young\\", which Clapton disliked, because he \\"always wanted to sound like an old guy\\". Critical reception Contemporary reviews were largely positive. Rolling Stone noted the \\"warm, friendly\\" aspect of the record, commending \\"Clapton's voice\\" and the \\"mean guitar\\". Q magazine described the album as swinging \\"like leaves in the breeze\\". Robert Christgau rated the album with the \\"B\\" mark and noted: \\"I blame a conceptual error, rather than Clapton's uncertain singing, for the overall thinness. As a sideman, Clapton slipped into producer Delaney Bramlett's downhome bliss as easily as he did into Cream's blues dreamscape, but as a solo artist he can't simulate Delaney's optimism\\". In a retrospective review for AllMusic Stephen Thomas Erlewine feels that Clapton \\"sounds more laid-back and straightforward than any of the guitarist's previous recordings. There are still elements of blues and rock & roll, but they're hidden beneath layers of gospel, R&B;, country, and pop flourishes. And the pop element of the record is the strongest of the album's many elements\\". Erlewine finishes his summary by stating \\"it's encouraging to hear him grow and become a more fully rounded musician, but too often the album needs the spark that some long guitar solos would have given it. In short, it needs a little more of Clapton's personality.\\" Track listings Personnel * Eric Clapton – lead guitar, lead vocals * Delaney Bramlett – rhythm guitar, backing vocals * Stephen Stills – guitar, backing vocals * Leon Russell, John Simon – piano * Bobby Whitlock – organ, backing vocals * Carl Radle – bass guitar * Jim Gordon – drums * Jim Price – trumpet * Bobby Keys – saxophone * Tex Johnson – percussion * Bonnie Bramlett – backing vocals * Rita Coolidge – backing vocals * Sonny Curtis – backing vocals * Jerry Allison – backing vocals ;Production * Producer and Arranged by Delaney Bramlett * Engineer – Bill Halverson * Recorded at The Village Recorder (Los Angeles, CA). * Album Design and Photography – Barry Feinstein and Tom Wilkes for Camoflauge Productions. * Equipment – Bill Reed, Clark * Road Manager – Bruce McCaskill Weekly charts { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" - !Chart (1970) !Peak position - !scope=row - !scope=row - !scope=rowUS Billboard 200 align=\\"center\\"13 } References External links * Eric Clapton albums 1970 debut albums Polydor Records albums Atco Records albums Albums produced by Delaney Bramlett Albums recorded at Olympic Sound Studios ","title":"Eric Clapton (album)"},{"id":"2828642","text":"Movies, Games and Videos (originally called Movies, Movies, Movies) was a television programme shown on ITV in the United Kingdom throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s. The show reviewed new releases of movies, games, and videos, and was originally voiced by Steve Priestley in an offscreen role.https://radiotoday.co.uk/2017/06/steve-priestley-joins-the-breeze- breakfast/ It was produced by production company Capricorn Programmes for London Weekend Television (later Yorkshire Television and also HTV) who syndicated the programme to a variety of countries. Local broadcasters were sent scripts and given the option to re-voice programme content if required. The show also included reviews of new game systems, video game creators and conventions/shows. A short-lived spin-off magazine was also produced. Scheduling Movies, Games and Videos was not networked per se (not broadcast in a rigid timeslot on a specific day), but was shown in all regions to begin with. Initially this was on a Saturday lunchtime in a variety of slots - 12:30, 13:45, 15:10 etc. but gradually the scheduling varied wildly depending on each region. Some continued to broadcast it on a Saturday afternoon, whilst others began airing it in a 17:10 weekday slot, after CITV. Though initially successful, the show was gradually dropped by most regions and by Spring 1998, only Anglia, Central HTV, Grampian Television, Meridian, Scottish Television, UTV and Westcountry were broadcasting the series until August 2001.

It has several versions, and has been found in print as early as February 1982. Plot A young girl is home alone for the first time with only her dog for company. Listening to the news, she hears of a killer on the loose in her neighborhood. Terrified, she locks all the doors and windows, but she forgets about the basement window and it is left unlocked. She goes to bed, taking her dog to her room with her and letting it sleep under her bed. She wakes in the night to hear a dripping sound coming from the bathroom. The dripping noise frightens her, but she is too scared to get out of bed and find out what it is. To reassure herself, she reaches a hand toward the floor for the dog and is rewarded by a reassuring lick on her hand. The next morning when she wakes, she goes to the bathroom for a drink of water only to find her dead, mutilated dog hanging in the shower with his blood slowly dripping onto the tiles. On the shower wall, written in the dog's blood, are the words \\"HUMANS CAN LICK TOO.\\" Other story variations feature a nearsighted old woman rather than a young girl. The fate of the dog also varies, from the dog simply being hanged to it being skinned, disembowelled, or otherwise mutilated. The message is sometimes written on the floor or on the bathroom mirror rather than on the wall. Some versions include the parents' return and their discovery of the killer hiding elsewhere in the house, frequently the basement, the girl's bedroom closet, or under her bed. In other versions, the girl's parents arrive back in the morning and ask if their daughter had a good night. When she tells them that her dog had kept her calm by licking her hand, she is told that the dog in question had been locked either in the basement or outside. But it's either 'the girl ran out the house and the killer was found' or the Girl dies. Background *There is a forerunner in the 1919 story \\"The Diary of Mr. Poynter\\" by M. R. James, where a young man absently strokes his dog (as he thinks) while reading an old manuscript account of the sinister death of a young student obsessed with his own hair. Of course, the creature crouching at his side is not the dog. *This legend was featured in the film Campfire Tales (1997), story credited to DB Martin. *In an episode of Showtime's series The L Word, Alice tells a version of the story with her friends as they sit around a campfire. *The episode \\"Bedsit\\" from A Scare at Bedtime. *A variation of the story is featured in the film Urban Legends: Final Cut. *The episode \\"Family Remains\\" of Supernatural features an alteration on this story in which a feral child licks the hand of a teenage girl who panics when she realizes that her dog is in the hallway. In this version she sees the dog alive and realizes it's not the pet licking her, although the dog is mutilated when the show's heroes attempt to help the family escape. *The legend is also used by Bloody Mary in the follow-up to Urban Legends Final Cut, entitled Urban Legends: Bloody Mary, as a way to murder one of the high school boys that she sees as guilty for her death. *The legend is referenced in John Dies at the End, where the main character goes to bed (intending to lure out a ghost) and wakes up to find his dog still licking his hand, until he realizes he can hear his dog lapping water from the toilet next door. *The story is partially told by Francis Boulle on a camping trip in an episode of Made in Chelsea (Series 6, Episode 4). *A variation of this story is told by one of the main characters in the premiere episode of The Enfield Haunting. *A variation of this story is written as the backstory for the character Reimi Sugimoto from Jump manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 4, Diamond Is Unbreakable by Hirohiko Araki.

Tatoosh is the largest of a small group of islands also often referred to as simply \\"Tatoosh Island\\", which are almost as far west as Cape Alava, which is about to the south and the westernmost point in the contiguous 48 states. The islands are part of the Makah Reservation and a part of Clallam County. The total land area of the island group is . Historically, Tatoosh Island was inhabited seasonally by Makah fishing camps and employees of the United States Coast Guard, Weather Bureau, and Navy. Currently, there is no resident population on the islands. Access to the island requires written permission of the Makah tribe. The island's name comes from a Makah chief known as Tatoosh (also Tatooche or Tetacus). Tatoosh Island has been home to Cape Flattery Light, which overlooks the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, since December 28, 1857.Cape Flattery Light on Tatoosh Island begins operating on December 28, 1857, HistoryLink.org The whole island was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. and Ecology Cape Flattery Lightstation, circa 1943 - 1953 left Because of its isolation, climate, and location in the ecologically productive northeastern Pacific Ocean, Tatoosh Island is home to many nesting seabirds, several marine mammals, and a diverse community of marine plants and animals. Beginning in 1967, Professor Robert T. Paine of the University of Washington and his colleagues have undertaken detailed studies of marine ecology on the island. Consequently, it is now one of the most intensively studied field sites in the world. The research has revealed how species are linked to each other through a network of species interactions, and how environmental changes and species extinction are transmitted through the food web. Key ecological concepts explored by this research include keystone species, control by consumers and natural disturbances on ecosystem structure and spatial patterning, species interaction strength, body size-dependent population dynamics, and impacts of environmental changes such as ocean acidification and El Niño events on complex ecosystems. =Climate= Tatoosh Island has an extremely moderated oceanic climate (Cfb) with very cool but quite long summers, and long, moderate and wet winters.

Gopal was a prominent popular singer and composer of Nepali music. Regarded one of the most significant cultural icons in Nepal, he is referred as \\"Swar Samrat\\" (Nepali: स्वर सम्राट, meaning: Emperor of Voice) in Nepal. He is also known as \\"King of Tragedy\\" owing to his numerous tragedy songs. He also sang in Nepal Bhasa. Owing to his vocal range he was capable of singing songs of every Nepalese genre. Often, his songs were accompanied by the sitar, harmonium and flute. He was also a music director during the 1950s to the 70s and belongs to the first generation of professional Nepali singers. His songs have been showcased in several movies and dramas across the country. Narayan Gopal released 137 songs during his lifetime, his first songs were composed by his friend Prem Dhoj Pradhan and his teacher Manik Ratna. Gopal is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century and received many awards during his lifetime.  Personal life  Narayan Gopal Guruacharya was born into a Newar family in Kilagal Tole, Kathmandu, on October 4, 1939 (18 Asoj, 1996 B.S.) to Asha Gopal Guruacharya (father) and Ram Devi Guruacharya (mother). He had six brothers and four sisters. The known name of his siblings are Manohar Gopal Guruacharya, Nanda Gopal Guruacharya, Ram Gopal Guruacharya, Laxman Gopal Guruacharya and Shanti Guruacharya. He completed School Leaving Certificate (SLC) in 2016 B.S. and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Humanities from Tri-Chandra College. He also went to Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in India to study Indian classical music but returned to Nepal without completing his studies. He married Pemala Lama in 1971. Later he joined the Rastriya Naach Ghar (National Dance Theater) and rose to the post of manager (hakim). He also worked as the editor of a musical journal 'Bageena (बागीना)' for its first three issues. He became the managing director of 'Sanskritik Sansthan (Cultural Center)' and adviser to the Ministry of Communication and was an associate professor in Lalit Kala Campus. He wrote a musical drama titled 'Kanchi Masyang (कान्छी मस्याङ)'. Early career The potential of his vocal talent was first recognized by his friend \\"Manik Ratna Sthapit\\", who lived in the neighboring Pyukha Tole, and Prem Dhoj Pradhan, who lived in Bheda Singh Tole. The three friends would practice singing Hindi songs together in Manik Ratna's house which had become similar to a music school since his uncle, Siddhi Ratna Sthapit, was an accomplished instrumentalist. After completion of his SLC exams, Prem Dhoj Pradhan took Gopal to Radio Nepal for a voice test. He sang \\"Panchi ko pankha ma dharti ko diyo,\\" written by Dr. Ram Man Trishit and composed by Prem Dhoj Pradhan himself. Gopal passed the voice test the very first time. Narayan Gopal's first public musical performance was during the 40th anniversary of Tri Chandra College in which he played the role of a tabla player. =First successes= By that time Prem- Manik duo had started to sing their own compositions. Following suit, Narayan Gopal composed six original songs written by the contemporary poet Ratna Shumsher Thapa. In that collection four of the songs were for solo vocal ('स्वर्गकी रानी', 'आँखाको भाखा आँखैले', 'भो भो मलाई नछेक', 'मधुमासमा यो दिल') and two were for duet ('बिछोडको पीडा' र 'ए कान्छा ठट्टैमा यो बैंश जानलाग्यो'). All these songs were eventually recorded in Kolkata, India, while he was in that country for his studies. These songs started to attract attention within Nepal and India. Nepal at the time had recently been liberated from Rana rule. Midst these wave of social and political changes, Narayan Gopal was able to lend his voice to songs related to love, life, hope, and patriotism. While the East-West highway was under construction, he recorded ‘जाग, जाग चम्क हे नौजवान हो,’ whereas in the fervor of patriotism ‘आमा ! तिमीलाई जलभरिका औंलाहरुले चुम्न’. Such songs made him popular among the youths of Nepal. His songs further evolved as he became more selective of songs with right combination of words, music, and emotions. Along with his contemporaries such as Pushpa Nepali, Bacchu Kailash, Tara Devi, Amber Gurung, Prem Dhoj Pradhan, Nati Kaji, Shiva Shankar, Kiran Pradhan he added a new dimension to modern Nepali music. To broaden his style, he started to hold discussions with his admirers, his competitors, and his critics. It was in this process of development that he visited Darjeeling, India, in March 1965. The visit was fruitful for two reasons: there he met his long-time fan and future wife, Pemala Lama. He also met another young, struggling musician Gopal Yonzon, with whom he formed a close friendship as mitjyus, in part because both had Gopal as their names.  Association Acts  =Association with Gopal Yonzon= With the partnership of a famous composer and lyricist Gopal Yonzon during the later sixties, Narayan Gopal's music entered a new phase in which he began to write about love, loss and tragedy. In the words of Ishwar Bhallav, Narayan Gopal became the singer of the hearts of the Nepali people. Rafi's association with Gopal Yonzon helped Narayan Gopal establish himself as one of the most prominent singers in Nepali music history. It was also at this time that new sounds from the West, such as by the Beatles and Bob Dylan, were entering and influencing the music of Nepal. To confront the influence of Western pop music, a new consciousness and a new style of music was necessary. To meet these challenges, Narayan Gopal in partnership with Gopal Yonzon created songs that continue to be popular in Nepal. Song like बिर्सेर फेरि मलाई नहेर, चिनारी हाम्रो धेरै पुरानो, तिम्रो जस्तो मुटु मेरो पनि, लौ सुन म भन्छु मेरो रामकहानी not only gave new lease of life to Gopal Yonzon's musical career, but it also carved a special niche for Narayan Gopal among the listeners of Nepali music. =Association with Dibya Khaling= After partition with Gopal Yonzon , Narayan Gopal started to work with composer and lyricist Dibya Khaling, they created some harmonious songs like \\"Sadhain Nai Ma Hasen Timilai Ruwai\\", \\"Bipana Nabhai Banchidine Ma Bhitraka Mera Sapana\\", \\"Mayako Aadharma Samjhauta Nai Hunchha\\", \\"Jata Hindyo UHeren\\" tai Tanne Baimani yo Maya\\", \\" Mero Sano Sansar Timilai Atena\\", \\" Yo Bhagyale Kasto Khel Manisako Jiwanma Her Kheleko\\", \\"Jati Samma Bato Hindisake M Bhanchhu Merai Prayas Ho\\", \\"Priyasiko Yaadharu Koriyeko Mutu,Ekantma Aaj Yahan Phookayer Heren\\", \\"Timilai Bhulda Ma Eklo Parechhu,Timilai Samjhen Timi Yaad Aayau\\", and \\" Ma Ta Laliguraans Bhayechhu\\". =Association with Famous Poet Bhupi Sherchan= Narayan Gopal and famous poet Bhupi Sherchan were close friends. When Narayan Gopal moved to Pokhara for stay, Bhupi Sherchan invited Narayan Gopal to stay his house, and Narayan Gopal stayed there for some months. Narayan Gopal sang some Bhupi Sherchan's lyrics like \\"Aljhechha Kyare pachhyauri, Timro Chiyako Buttama\\", \\"Sanai Hurima Bainsako Sapana Shimalko Phool Jhain Jhari Gayo\\" and \\" Maile Gayeko Geetma Timrai Hansilo Muhar Chha\\" and become hit number songs. =Association with Famous Poet Ishwor Ballav= Narayan Gopal's partnership with Ishwor Ballav gave hit number songs like \\"Duita Phool Deuralima, Sathai Rakhyaun jasto Lagchha\\", \\"Mero Behoshi Aaaj, Mero Lagi Parda Bho\\", \\"Sara Din Arulai Baden,Sayad Yi Raat Mera\\", \\"Bihan Nabhai Batasle, Sheet Kina Sukaidinchha\\", \\"Malai Jindagi Yo Lagdachha, Timi Bhandachhau, Pyar Ho\\", and \\"Yo Kasto Byatha Ho\\". Poet I.B. wrote lyrical poem for Narayan Gopal and those songs gave Narayan Gopal new heights in his career. During this time, he collaborated with established Nepali composers like Nati Kaji, Shiva Sankar, Amber Gurung, and Dharmaraj Thapa. He was starting to be known as the singer of intellect. During the beginning of the seventies, he married his long-time fan Pemala at the age of thirty-one. After their marriage his residence shifted for some time to Pokhara and later for some time to Hetauda. In Pokhara, he became acquainted with the poet Bhupi Sherchan, while in Hetauda he became acquainted with fellow songwriter and composer Bhim Birag. As a result of the interactions, he composed and sang Bhupi Sherchan's सानै हुरीमा बैँसको सपना and अल्झेछ क्यारे पछ्यौरी तिम्रो चियाको बुट्टामा; and he sang Bhim Birag's तिमीले पनि मजस्तै माया दिएर हेर. Later career After his short stay in Hetauda, Narayan Gopal returned to Kathmandu and managed to find a job in Rastriya Naach Ghar (National Dance Theater) with the help of his friends Manik Ratna and Janardan Sama. He had entered Naach Ghar as a mere instrumentalist, but he slowly rose to the post of a hakim (rector). At this stage of his life, he found himself confronting a new generation of Nepali youths. Among the young musical talents of that time, his partnership with Dibya Khaling took off; and he started lending his voice to Khalings compositions, thus initiating another phase of his singing career. Songs like सँधै नै म हाँसे तिमीलाई रुवाई, मायाको आधारमा सम्झौता नै हुन्छ, बिपना नभइ helped to revive his popularity. During this stage he started to collaborate with new breed of songwriters such as \\"Khyetra Pratap Adhikari\\", \\"Kali Prasad Rijal\\", \\"Norden Rumba\\", \\"Dinesh Adhikari\\", and \\"Bishwambhar Pyaukurel\\", while his relationship with his old collaborators was neglected. Among the composers of the new generation, he collaborated with the likes of Sambhujit Baskota, \\"Bhupendra Rayamajhi\\", and \\"Shubha Bahadur\\". In his late stage of career, he lent his considerable prestige to launch the career of many upcoming musicians. As such, he was willing to compromise his artistry and sing weak songs by new composers and songwriters. He also sang in film songs. In total his career spanned twenty-eight years, during which he sang in eighteen movies and recorded more than one hundred and fifty-seven songs. Death Gopal was urged by friends to quit smoking and drinking in the interests of his health. He quit drinking a few months before he died, but was unable to quit cigarettes. Narayan Gopal died from complications of diabetes on December 5, 1990 (19 Mangsir, 2047 B.S.) in Bir Hospital, at 9 p.m. in Kathmandu, at the age of 51. He had no children. After the death of Gopal, there were a number of music festivals that were created dedicated to Gopal. = Legacy = To honour the king of Nepalese music, there are celebrations held on the day of his death annually in Nepal. The government has built many statues for Gopal, such as one in Chakrapath, Kathmandu which has flowers that were planted on the 21st death anniversary event of Narayan Gopal held on December 5, 2011. After death of Gopal other artists have said about Gopal's habits,for example famous musician and composer of National anthem of Nepal, Amber Gurung said, Musical style To Narayan Gopal, the most important part in the art of modern songs were: melody, lyrics, and the singer. This did not rule out other aspects, however. Chords, he said, are required to put life in the music, but the chord progression is part of the arrangement, not something to base the composition of the melody on. When the melody is composed, the arranger will make the progression from the melody. Without a good arrangement, Narayan Gopal said, a song will be like a vegetable dish without salt or other spices. The aspects of this recipe at work included non repetitive melodies moving over the accompaniment in short, repeated rhythmic figures; heterophony, countermelodies, chords, and harmonic progressions; one melody for refrain, another for the verse, and then—as part of the arrangement—melodies for the instrumental interludes marking off the sung sections. Awards and recognitions Narayan Gopal was awarded several national honours which include (all dates in Bikram Sambat): * Best Composition (Radio Nepal) – 2023 B.S. * Best Singer (Radio Nepal) – 2024 B.S. * Ratna Record Award – 2039 B.S. * Gorkha Dakshin Bahu, Fourth – 2033 B.S. * Indra Rajya Laxmi Award – 2040 B.S. * Chhinalata Award – 2044 B.S. * Jagadamba Shree – 2045 B.S. * Urbashi Rang Award – 2047 B.S. * Trishakti Patta, Third – 2048 B.S.

It is on the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya and Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya lines. Kitay-gorod is one of the four stations within the Moscow Metro network providing a cross-platform interchange (besides , and Kashirskaya). Until November 1990, the station was called Ploshchad Nogina (Nogin Square), for the square that was named in honor of Viktor Nogin, the prominent Bolshevik. After the city renamed the southern part of Ploshchad Nogina to Ploshchad Varvarskiye Vorot, the station was renamed for the historic Kitai-gorod area.  History  Originally the station was to open along the intersection of the two lines when their connecting points in the centre would link the Zhdanovskiy and Krasnopresnenskiy radii and the Kaluzhskiy and Rizhskiy radii in mid-1970s. However the overcrowding of the ring line due to passengers travelling between the two lines it was decided to accelerate works on this transfer point prematurely. The first trains arrived from both Kaluzhskaya and Zhdanovskaya lines on 30 December 1970. Because Ploshad Nogina was a terminus for both lines, trains would terminate at the eastern hall and then go off into the tunnels, where piston junctions were installed for both lines, and then come back on the western hall. For the transfer purposes, it was possible for passengers not to depart the trains when they crossed the platform on the eastern hall. On 31 December 1971, the Kaluzhskaya line linked up with the Rizhskaya to form the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya line. Trains from that line began operating in normal thoroughfare, though it was still possible to go on the Zdanovskaya line by boarding on the eastern platform. The transfer point entered its full operational regime only in late 1975 when on the 17 December, Zdanovskaya and Krasnopresnenskaya lines connected to form the Zhdanovsko- Krasnopresnenskaya Line.  Design  Consisting of two separate, parallel station halls united via a transfer corridor and two combined vestibules, the station was built in an era when decorative architecture once again began to emerge and the combined effort of the architects Strelkov and Moloshenok as well as decorative authors Rusin, Lapina and Bodniek, whose efforts, amongst other places, are seen on the metallic artworks on the walls of both halls. The western hall, nicknamed Kristall (Crystal) is decorated with two rows of angular pylons faced with light gray marble. Large metal cornicles running along the base of the ceiling hide the illumination lamps. The walls are faced with bright marble and the floor with gray granite. The eastern hall is nicknamed Garmoshka (Garmon), because of its pylons (faced with yellowish marble) which look like a stretched accordion parallel to the length of the hall. The walls are faced with a greyish marble and the floor with bright granite. Heritage of the station's original name, Ploshchad Nogina, can still be found midway in the transfer passage, where a bust of Viktor Nogin (sculptor Shlykov) still stands.  Transfers  The station serves northbound trains heading towards Medvedkovo and Planernaya come via the eastern platform and southbound trains heading towards Novoyasenevskaya and Vykhino coming via the western one. For passengers wishing to travel in the opposite direction, it is required to use a transfer corridor linking the two platforms.  Exits  Two underground vestibules allow transfer to the surface. The southern vestibule is located under Slavyanskaya Square and is interlinked with multiple subways. Both escalator tunnels follow directly to the vestibule. The northern one is located under the Staraya Square with subway linkages to the Maroseika street along with others. The passengers must first travel up a flight of stairs from the two halls before turning left and travelling for a while and then go up on a combined escalator. This arrangement was purpose- built for a transfer to the future Maroseika station of the Arbatsko- Pokrovskaya Line, whose tunnels pass north of the Kitay-gorod station.

The result of CLM is an increase in current with drain bias and a reduction of output resistance. Channel length modulation occurs in all field effect transistors, not just MOSFETs. To understand the effect, first the notion of pinch-off of the channel is introduced. The channel is formed by attraction of carriers to the gate, and the current drawn through the channel is nearly a constant independent of drain voltage in saturation mode. However, near the drain, the gate and drain jointly determine the electric field pattern. Instead of flowing in a channel, beyond the pinch- off point the carriers flow in a subsurface pattern made possible because the drain and the gate both control the current. In the figure at the right, the channel is indicated by a dashed line and becomes weaker as the drain is approached, leaving a gap of uninverted silicon between the end of the formed inversion layer and the drain (the pinch-off region). As the drain voltage increases, its control over the current extends further toward the source, so the uninverted region expands toward the source, shortening the length of the channel region, the effect called channel-length modulation. Because resistance is proportional to length, shortening the channel decreases its resistance, causing an increase in current with increase in drain bias for a MOSFET operating in saturation. The effect is more pronounced the shorter the source-to-drain separation, the deeper the drain junction, and the thicker the oxide insulator. In the weak inversion region, the influence of the drain analogous to channel-length modulation leads to poorer device turn off behavior known as drain-induced barrier lowering, a drain induced lowering of threshold voltage. In bipolar devices a similar increase in current is seen with increased collector voltage due to base-narrowing, known as the Early effect. The similarity in effect upon the current has led to use of the term \\"Early effect\\" for MOSFETs as well, as an alternative name for \\"channel-length modulation\\". Shichman–Hodges model  In textbooks, channel length modulation in active mode usually is described using the Shichman–Hodges model, accurate only for old technology: where I_D = drain current, K'_n = technology parameter sometimes called the transconductance coefficient, W, L = MOSFET width and length, V_{GS} = gate-to-source voltage, V_{th} =threshold voltage, V_{DS} = drain-to-source voltage, V_{DS,sat} = V_{GS} - V_{th}, and λ = channel-length modulation parameter. In the classic Shichman–Hodges model, V_{th} is a device constant, which reflects the reality of transistors with long channels. Output resistance Channel-length modulation is important because it decides the MOSFET output resistance, an important parameter in circuit design of current mirrors and amplifiers. In the Shichman–Hodges model used above, output resistance is given as: ::begin{align} r_O &= frac{1 + lambda V_{DS}}{lambda I_D}  &= frac{1}{I_D}left(frac{1}{lambda} + V_{DS}right)  &= frac{V_E L/{Delta L} + V_{DS}}{I_D} end{align} where V_{DS} = drain-to-source voltage, I_D = drain current and lambda = channel- length modulation parameter. Without channel-length modulation (for λ = 0), the output resistance is infinite. The channel-length modulation parameter usually is taken to be inversely proportional to MOSFET channel length L, as shown in the last form above for rO: ::lambda approx frac{Delta L}{V_EL}, where VE is a fitting parameter, although it is similar in concept to the Early Voltage for BJTs. For a 65 nm process, roughly VE ≈ 4 V/μm. (A more elaborate approach is used in the EKV model. ). However, no simple formula used for λ to date provides accurate length or voltage dependence of rO for modern devices, forcing use of computer models, as discussed briefly next. The effect of channel-length modulation upon the MOSFET output resistance varies both with the device, particularly its channel length, and with the applied bias. The main factor affecting the output resistance in longer MOSFETs is channel length modulation as just described. In shorter MOSFETs additional factors arise such as: drain-induced barrier lowering (which lowers the threshold voltage, increasing the current and decreasing the output resistance), velocity saturation (which tends to limit the increase in channel current with drain voltage, thereby increasing the output resistance) and ballistic transport (which modifies the collection of current by the drain, and modifies drain-induced barrier lowering so as to increase supply of carriers to the pinch-off region, increasing the current and decreasing the output resistance). Again, accurate results require computer models.

The band formed in the early 1960s under the name The Popbeams, which they changed before the release of their first album which they recorded while still in their teens. The duo's true identities are most likely known only to a few individuals at Silence Records, the record label that the band has worked with since 1971. Philemon Arthur and the Dung do not want their identities to be known, lest those who live in their small village find out who they are. The band's music is recorded on reel-to-reel tape decks with crackling microphones and is played on untuned guitars, drums, and accordions, with the occasional accompaniment of household objects such as saucepans, chairs, and radiators. The lyrics vary from utter nonsense, such as profoundly whimsical observations about everyday life, to satire concerning social phenomena such as homelessness, pollution, and hunting. Despite their outsider-persona, the band has received much notice across Sweden. Their surrealistic self-titled debut won a Swedish Grammy for the best Swedish LP of 1971, which came to the dismay of many. Modern Swedish bands like their fellow Scanians bob hund have been greatly inspired by Philemon Arthur and the Dung, and it was this eccentric duo who discovered and forwarded bob hund's demo tape to Silence Records.

He raped Vincent and cut off her arms, then left her to die in a culvert off the Interstate 5 in Del Puerto Canyon, California. Vincent managed to crawl up to safety and later acted as a key witness against the rapist. Released from prison on good behavior after serving 8 years of his 14-year sentence, he later murdered Roxanne Hayes, a mother of three. On February 19, 1997, police found Singleton covered in blood after stabbing her in his new home. Biography Singleton was born in Tampa, Florida. He worked as a merchant seaman. First conviction On September 29, 1978, Singleton picked up 15-year-old Mary Vincent of Las Vegas while she was hitchhiking in Berkeley, California. He knocked her unconscious with a sledgehammer, spent the whole night raping her, and tortured her by severing both her forearms with a hatchet. Singleton figured she was dead or near death, and he threw her off of a 30-foot cliff on Interstate 5 near Del Puerto Canyon, California, leaving her naked and bleeding out. She mitigated the bleeding from her forearms by shoving them into mud, and the mud suppressed her bleeding while she managed to pull herself back up the cliff. She walked for three miles, naked, covered in blood, and armless, before finding and alerting a passing couple, who took her to a hospital. By the time of Singleton's arrest, Vincent wore prosthetic arms. Six months after the assault, Vincent faced Singleton at his trial, where her testimony helped to convict him. Singleton was sentenced to 14 years in prison, the maximum allowed by law in California at that time. The presiding judge remarked: \\"If I had the power, I would send him to prison for the rest of his natural life.\\" While Vincent won a $2.56 million civil judgment against Singleton, she was unable to collect it when Singleton revealed that he was unemployed, in poor health, and had only $200 in savings. Along with the particularly gruesome and callous aspects of the crime, the case became even more notorious after Singleton was paroled after serving only eight years in prison. He was able to reduce his time through good behavior and working as a teaching assistant in a prison classroom. Singleton was paroled to Contra Costa County, California, but no town would accept his presence, so he had to live in a trailer on the grounds of San Quentin until his parole ended a year later. According to Time, \\"as authorities attempted to settle him in one Bay Area town after another, angry crowds and Tampa's chapter of Guardian Angels led protests, screamed, picketed and eventually prevailed.\\" In Rodeo, about 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, a crowd of approximately 500 local protestors were up in arms and forced officers to move him under armed guard from a hotel room. Authorities tried housing him across the street from Concord's City Hall, but that was met with protests and failed too. He was removed from one apartment in Contra Costa County in a bullet- proof vest after 400 residents surrounded the building to protest a decision to place him there permanently. Governor George Deukmejian ordered that Singleton be placed in a trailer on the grounds of San Quentin for the duration of his one-year parole. The outrage at this sentence resulted in legislation, supported by Mary Vincent, which prevents the early release of offenders who have committed a crime in which torture is used: in 1987 Singleton's parole led to passage of California's \\"Singleton bill\\", which carries a 25-years-to-life sentence. (Harrower, 1998). The leniency of the legal system shocked and outraged many. One journalist who interviewed him remarked, \\"What was most surprising to me, however, was not his sentence. It was that Larry Singleton had worked his crimes around in his mind so completely that they did not warrant punishment at all.\\" Right before Singleton's parole ended, Donald Stahl, the Stanislaus County prosecutor at Singleton's trial, said, \\"I think, if anything, he's worse now. He has not taken responsibility. He lives in a bizarre fantasy land and acquits himself each day. He doesn't accept his guilt and won't resolve never to do it again.\\" Move to Florida Singleton returned to his native Florida after his release. In 1990, he was twice convicted of theft. He served a 60-day sentence for stealing a $10 disposable camera in spring 1990 and in the winter received a two-year prison term for stealing a $3 hat. Before his sentencing for the latter crime, he described himself to the judge as \\"a confused, muddleheaded old man\\". In the spring of 1997, a neighbor called police to report Singleton assaulting a woman in his home in Sulphur Springs, Florida. When police responded, they found the body of Roxanne Hayes; she had been stabbed multiple times in the upper body. Hayes was a sex worker and a mother of three. Mary Vincent traveled from California to Tampa to appear at Singleton's sentencing. During her testimony, she described Singleton's attack and the toll the ordeal had taken on her. The judge sentenced Singleton to death. Singleton died in 2001 of cancer in a prison hospital at the North Florida Reception Center in Starke, Florida.

It is located on Tsing Yi Island, facing Rambler Channel. It is part of the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals. The total site area is 1.5 square kilometres and the terminal itself comprises an area 0.68 km² and as long as 1.9 kilometres. The rest of land is for logistics and storage. When the terminal was built the sea bed was dredged (dug deeper) to accommodate the largest container vessels. CT9 has 6 berths and a capacity of . The terminal was developed by 3 operators; Modern Terminals Ltd. (MTL), Hongkong International Terminals Ltd. (HIT), and Asia Container Terminals Limited (ACT). ACT got two berths from MTL for two berths in exchange for contribution in CT9. Currently, HIT has 2 berths in CT9 and MTL owns the remaining 4. The berths were to be completed by the year 2005. Facing opposition from PRC There was a long dispute over the building of CT9 between the PRC and the United Kingdom beginning in November 1992. Hong Kong Government purposely diversified the number of providers of port services awarding project through a directed tender and Sea-Land consortium got the project. However, PRC insisted the tender must be open and competitive bid. The PRC alleged the results were in favour of British interests. The British company Jardine Matheson, a company with its listing and incorporation withdrawn from Hong Kong in the 1980s, participated in the consortium. The project was delayed until the Joint Liaison Group meeting of the UK and PRC in September 1996. Jardine Matheson was willing to be withdrawn from the project in acquiring two existing berths. After lengthy negotiation, the signing of the project was on 8 December 1998 and the terminal was opened on 22 July 2003. The delay of project caused substantial losses in Hong Kong in 1990s. The over-congestion in Kwai Chung Container Port caused cargo to be diverted to Shekou and Kaohsiung instead of Hong Kong. Concerns =Traffic= The decision of building CT9 on Tsing Yi Island aroused much concern from local residents. In the 1990s, the traffic condition worsened. The residents worried that CT9 would bring too many Heavy Goods Vehicles to overburden Tsing Yi Bridge and Tsing Yi North Bridge, worsening the condition. They hoped the government would build Container Terminals 10 and 11 in northern Lantau Island instead of CT9. With new highways, Route 9 (now Route 8) and Route 3, and the Duplicate Tsing Yi Bridge completed in late 1990s and early 2000s, some residents urged the government to complete the road infrastructure for CT9 before the completion of the berths. As recently as 2005 the pressure on the traffic became much lower. =Environment= Another concern is environmental. CT9 is located near Cheung Ching Estate and Mayfair Gardens. The machinery and heavy goods vehicles would cause noise pollution to these residential housing estates. Moreover, the spotlights of CT9 would disturb the residents. The government decided to leave a buffer for building offices, serviced apartments or hotels to block the noise and strong light. It turned out the serviced apartment Rambler Crest by Hutchison Whampoa was sold as property. The seabed of the Rambler Channel was dredged to allow large vessels to berth in the new terminals. Those polluted and unpolluted muds and sands were moved to Cheung Chau and Sha Chau for treatment and storage. Greenpeace held a protest for the dumping of mud out of Hong Kong in 2000, fearing that the polluted muds would affect the environment of outlying islands. New road infrastructure for CT9 With expectation of high land container traffic from CT9, new road infrastructure was built on Tsing Yi. Tsing Yi Road, a road connecting from Tsing Yi Bridge to South Tsing Yi Island, was re-routed to the new road along the CT9. Stonecutters Bridge was built between CT9 and Container Terminal 8 (CT8) of Stonecutters Island, across the Rambler Channel. Nam Wan Tunnel was built, from CT9 to Tsing Ma Bridge and Ting Kau Bridge; it and Stonecutters Bridge were opened in December 2009. The new road infrastructure forms a net across the container port and connects to major highways in Hong Kong. Collapse of containers 2005 On 9 May 2005 at noon, heavy rain storms during the day caused stacks of containers to collapse in CT9. 20 containers fell on two trucks in a wind of 135 km/h and one of the drivers was found dead. High stacking of containers, sometimes as high as eight levels, is not uncommon in Hong Kong; this aroused concern regarding safety and methods of stacking containers.

It is part of the Rinzai school of Zen's Engaku-ji branch, and was opened by Hōjō Sadatoki in 1285. It is best known as a historic refuge for women who were abused by their husbands. It is for this reason sometimes referred to as the \\"Divorce Temple\\". History The temple was founded in the 8th year of Koan (1285) by nun Kakusan-ni, wife of Hōjō Tokimune (1251–1284), after her husband's death. Because it was then customary for a wife to become a nun after her husband's death, she decided to open the temple and dedicate it to the memory of her husband. She also made it a refuge for battered wives. In an age when men could easily divorce their wives but wives had great difficulty divorcing their husbands, Tōkei-ji allowed women to become officially divorced after staying there for two years. Temple records show that, during the Tokugawa period alone, an estimated 2,000 women sought shelter there. The temple lost its right to concede divorce in 1873, when a new law was approved and the Court of Justice started to handle the cases. The temple remained a nunnery for over 600 years and men could not enter until 1902, when a man took the post of abbot and Tōkei-ji came under the supervision of Engaku-ji. Before then, the chief nun was always an important figure, and once it even was a daughter of Emperor Go-Daigo. Tenshū-ni, the daughter and only survivor of Toyotomi Hideyori's family, son of Hideyoshi, entered Tōkei-ji following the Siege of Osaka. Such was the nunnery's prestige that its couriers did not need to prostrate themselves when they met a daimyōs procession. The two main buildings of the complex are the Main Hall and the Suigetsu-dō, but the latter is not open to visitors. The temple's old Butsuden, an Important Cultural Property, was bought during the Meiji period by businessman Tomitaro Hara and is now in the garden he built, Yokohama's Sankei-en. Cemetery Behind the temple there is a graveyard where many celebrities are buried, among them in adjacent graves are three men also famous among European Zen and haiku aficionados, Kitarō Nishida, Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki and Reginald Horace Blyth.

Wildman worked on numerous Marvel UK's titles in the late 1980s, including Galaxy Rangers, Thundercats, The Real Ghostbusters, and Transformers. His first strip work on Transformers came in #198 for the story \\"Cold Comfort\\" and \\"Joy\\". He would rapidly ascend to being one of the key members of the title's art team, often working with inker Stephen Baskerville. Wildman and Baskerville followed writer Simon Furman to the American Transformers title soon afterwards, providing the art for issues #69-74 and #76-80. His artwork, which often applied human characteristics to the robotic protagonists, was divisive amongst some fans but generally lauded for capturing the emotion of Furman's scripts. After the title was cancelled with #80, he continued to work for Marvel on various series, becoming the regular artist on X-Men Adventures (adaptations of the storylines from the popular 1990s cartoon series) and G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. He briefly provided art for Transformers: Generation 2, drawing three pages of Transformers: Generation 2 #2 as a favour to Furman and editor Rob Tokar when the original artist, Derek Yaniger, fell behind. Further work for Marvel US included Spider-Man: The Arachnis Project, Venom: Carnage Unleashed (1995) (written by G.I. Joe scribe Larry Hama) and a four issue Black Cat mini-series. His final job for Marvel at the time was as the regular artist for Spider-Man 2099 from #33 to 43. He returned to the Transformers franchise in 2002, drawing numerous covers for Titan Publishing's series of TPB reprints. This was followed by Wildman working for Dreamwave Productions in 2003 to draw Transformers - The War Within: The Dark Ages, a 6-issue mini-series written by Furman. He also contributed art to Panini's Transformers Armada UK series, for issues #3 to #9; his work for issue #10 went unpublished when the title was cancelled. In 2007, in addition to providing some cover art for IDW, the new publishers of Transformer comics, he provided the artwork for Devil's Due Publishing's G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers IV 2-issue miniseries. In 2012, Wildman reunited with Furman and inker Stephen Baskerville on a relaunched Transformers ReGeneration One ongoing series, which continues the story and numbering of the original Marvel series. (While Wildman was succeeded on interior art by Guido Guidi as of #93, he continued to contribute cover art for the remainder of the series, and illustrated several pages of #100, the final issue) Wildman has continued his partnership with Furman. The pair regularly appear at Transformers conventions together including the UK event Auto Assembly and created an online Macromedia Flash comic called The Engine: Industrial Strength with UK New Media expert Adam Jennings. Draw the World Together logo Further projects include concept work for computer games development company NikNak, as well as the children's 'Paranormal Western' comic book adventure Frontier with cult writer Jason Cobley. In 2005 after undertaking the Landmark Education 'Curriculum for Living' Wildman created the charity project Draw the World Together. The project continues to go from strength to strength in partnership with computer games company NCsoft as it raises funds to benefit street children around the world and create healthcare and education possibilities.

He is often referred to as J. B. Foerster, and his surname is sometimes spelled Förster.  Life  Foerster was born in Prague. His ancestors were of Bohemian German ethnicity, but had assimilated into the Czech community. The family normally lived in Prague and was musical. His father, a composer also named Josef Foerster, taught at the Conservatory. (His father's students included Franz Lehár.) His brother was artist Viktor Foerster. Josef was educated accordingly, and duly studied there. He also showed an early interest in the theatre, and thought of becoming an actor. From 1884 he worked as a critic, and he would prove to be a writer of distinction. In 1893 he married the leading Czech soprano Berta Lautererová (Bertha Lauterer) in Hamburg, during ten years making his living there as a critic, and she was engaged at the Hamburg Staatsoper. In 1901 he became a teacher at the Hamburg Conservatory. In 1903 Berta went to sing at the Vienna Hofoper, and so Josef moved there with her, continuing to make a living as a music critic. He returned to Prague on the foundation of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, thereafter teaching at the conservatory and the university. In 1946 he was declared a National Composer. He died in Nový Vestec.  Style  Foerster produced numerous compositions. His music is not nationalistic in the sense of employing the idioms of Czech folk music. His work, words and music, is considered very subjective and personal, mystical and idealistic. Foerster's opera Eva is another example, like Leoš Janáček's Jenůfa, of a libretto based on a play by Gabriela Preissová, though his treatment differs. His compositions include five symphonies (No. 1 in D minor; No. 2 in F, Op. 29 (1892-8); No. 3 in D, Op. 36; No. 4 in C minor, Op. 54, \\"Easter Eve\\" (1905); and No. 5 in D minor, Op. 141 (1929) ), other orchestral works including a symphonic poem based on Cyrano de Bergerac, much chamber music (including five string quartets (No. 1 in E, Op. 15; No. 2, Op. 39; No. 3 in C, Op. 61; No. 4 in F, Op. 182 (1943); and the last, written 1950–1, completed by Jan Hanuš ); three piano trios, two violin and two cello sonatas, and a several-times-recorded wind quintet), at least five operas (notably Eva), concertos for cello (Op. 143) and two for violin (No. 1 in C minor, Op. 88 (1911); No. 2 in D minor, Op. 104), liturgical music, among other works, over 170 published opus numbers in all. Many of his works remember family members: the 2nd Symphony is dedicated to his sister Marie; his brother's death led to the cantata Mortuis fratribus; his son is commemorated in the Piano Trio and the 5th Symphony; and his mother is a theme throughout his oeuvre.

There are a variety of cases featured on the show, from murder cases to botched plastic surgery. Many of the storylines are based on real-life cases. Grant and Skip do their own \\"dirty work\\" for their cases, going to crime scenes and interviewing witnesses, as Grant teaches Skip more about what it means to be a “real lawyer” and Skip teaches Grant more about what it means to trust in people. The series is set in Venice and neighboring Santa Monica, California. Cast and characters *Don Johnson as Grant H. Cooper: A functioning alcoholic with a cynical view of the world, Cooper is nonetheless touched by the enthusiasm and idealism he sees in his unlikely new protégé. Skip's brilliant mind allowed him to excel at all things academic, but he had a sheltered upbringing and now finds himself in the working world with few social skills to fall back on. Skip needs the practical advice that can only come from an experienced trial lawyer, and Cooper is only too happy to have someone around to do the \\"grunt\\" work. As he helps the young man make the transition from school and boyhood to the tough world of court and manhood, Cooper is reminded of the best part of himself—the part that got lost along the way. Cooper repeatedly prides himself with being \\"jaded\\" after 27 years on the job. After refusing to agree to a plea bargain for one of his clients (several years before the series begins), he lost the case and that client was put to death by lethal injection, which for Cooper was the beginning of his downward spiral. From then on, he was forced to make a living as a small-time ambulance chaser, and has no problem admitting to it. * Jay Baruchel as David \\"Skip\\" Ross: David Ross is nicknamed \\"Skip\\" by his peers, not because he skipped classes, but rather because he skipped so many grades through his young life. By age 18 he is already a lawyer and a member of the California Bar Association, having graduated first in his class. His ambition is to become the best trial lawyer ever, originally inspired by one of his favorite movies, To Kill a Mockingbird. Unfortunately for him, no downtown law firm is willing to hire him because of his age. His young age is also hard on him because it is difficult for him to find a place to rent, since no one will believe that he is an actual lawyer. With Grant's help, Skip learns the inner workings of the legal system and the \\"do\\"s and \\"don't\\"s about courtroom law. Unlike Cooper, Skip is an optimist and looks at everything in a positive way. Skip cannot escape the fact this his college friend, Kate Manat (Susan Ward) has been hired by a downtown law firm and is often on the opposite side of the courtroom, a situation made more awkward by the fact that he is attracted to her. David \\"Skip\\" Ross is similar to Doogie Howser, M.D. *Jaime Lee Kirchner as Dulcinea \\"Dee\\" Real: The law office has only one employee, Dulcinea \\"Dee\\" Real, a former client of Cooper's who took the job to pay off her legal fees and fulfill her parole requirements. An African American in her mid-twenties, Dee is tough, blue collar and strikingly beautiful; a woman who looks amazing in jeans, a T-shirt and an electronic ankle bracelet. Her crime was murder and although Cooper managed to get the charge reduced to manslaughter, he was not able to keep her out of jail. Though he won't admit it, Cooper feels guilty that Dee ended up serving time. Smart, capable and completely immune to Cooper's charm, Dee can hold her own against Cooper and Skip, and she often manages to intimidate them both. *Reiley McClendon as Tom Ross, Skip's little brother. He's cool, calm, suave, and a likable guy. Unfortunately for him, he isn't as smart as his older brother, since he has failed 10th grade. He also can't seem to understand why Skip is such a workaholic and why his brother doesn't have much of a social life. Tom also enjoys hanging out at his brother's apartment, even though Skip doesn't approve. * Susan Ward as Kate Manat: Skip and Kate were college friends and study partners. Kate was hired by one of the downtown law firms that did not hire Skip. Episodes Cancellation and reairing Just Legal was cancelled in October 2005 after only three episodes aired due to low ratings; the program lost a large portion of its lead-in 7th Heaven’s audience and came in last place among the six major broadcast networks in its Monday night timeslot. After almost a year off the air, the series returned on August 6, 2006 with a rerun of the pilot episode, followed by the network burning off the final five episodes on subsequent Sundays. The final episode aired on September 10, 2006. Popular culture references *Don Johnson's character, Grant Cooper, is much like his role of Det. Sonny Crockett on Miami Vice, in that both are cynical, jaded men of the law who do know right from wrong but are willing to stand up against the powers that be if necessary. *In the episode The Heater, Grant Cooper says, \\"I used to live on a boat.\\" This is a subtle reference to his days on Miami Vice, where he played Det. Sonny Crockett who lived on the boat St. Vitus Dance. *Cooper was also the surname of his partner Rico Tubbs's alias on Miami Vice (\\"Rico Cooper\\"). *Names like Nancy Grace, Mark Geragos, Johnnie Cochran, and Greta Van Susteren have been mentioned in the show. *Famous modern-day courtroom cases such as Scott Peterson and Robert Blake have been mentioned.

According to this theory, as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness. Philip Brickman and Donald T. Campbell coined the term in their essay \\"Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society\\" (1971). The concept dates back centuries, to such writers as St. Augustine, cited in Robert Burton's 1621 Anatomy of Melancholy: \\"A true saying it is, Desire hath no rest, is infinite in itself, endless, and as one calls it, a perpetual rack, or horse-mill.\\" The hedonic (or happiness) set point has gained interest throughout the field of positive psychology where it has been developed and revised further. Given that hedonic adaptation generally demonstrates that a person's long-term happiness is not significantly affected by otherwise impacting events, positive psychology has concerned itself with the discovery of things that can lead to lasting changes in happiness levels. Overview Hedonic adaptation is a process or mechanism that reduces the affective impact of emotional events. Generally, hedonic adaptation involves a happiness \\"set point\\", whereby humans generally maintain a constant level of happiness throughout their lives, despite events that occur in their environment. in M. H. Apley, ed., Adaptation Level Theory: A Symposium, New York: Academic Press The process of hedonic adaptation is often conceptualized as a treadmill, since one must continually work to maintain a certain level of happiness. Hedonic adaptation can occur in a variety of ways. Generally, the process involves cognitive changes, such as shifting values, goals, attention and interpretation of a situation. Further, neurochemical processes desensitize overstimulated hedonic pathways in the brain, which possibly prevents persistently high levels of intense positive or negative feelings. The process of adaptation can also occur through the tendency of humans to construct elaborate rationales for considering themselves deprived through a process social theorist Gregg Easterbrook calls \\"abundance denial\\".Easterbrook, Gregg. The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse (Random House, 2003). Major theoretical approaches =Behavioral/psychological approach= The \\"Hedonic Treadmill\\" is a term coined by Brickman and Campbell in their article \\"Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society\\" (1971), describing the tendency of people to keep a fairly stable baseline level of happiness despite external events and fluctuations in demographic circumstances. The idea of relative happiness had been around for decades when in 1978 Brickman et al. began to approach hedonic pleasure within the framework of Helson's adaptation level theory, which holds that perception of stimulation is dependent upon comparison of former stimulations. The hedonic treadmill functions similarly to most adaptations that serve to protect and enhance perception. In the case of hedonics, the sensitization or desensitization to circumstances or environment can redirect motivation. This reorientation functions to protect against complacency, but also to accept unchangeable circumstances, and redirect efforts towards more effective goals. Frederick and Lowenstein classify three types of processes in hedonic adaptation: shifting adaptation levels, desensitization, and sensitization. Shifting adaptation levels occurs when a person experiences a shift in what is perceived as a \\"neutral\\" stimulus, but maintains sensitivity to stimulus differences. For example, if Sam gets a raise he will initially be happier, and then habituate to the larger salary and return to his happiness set point. But he will still be pleased when he gets a holiday bonus. Desensitization decreases sensitivity in general, which reduces sensitivity to change. Those who have lived in war zones for extended periods of time may become desensitized to the destruction that happens on a daily basis, and be less affected by the occurrence of serious injuries or losses that may once have been shocking and upsetting. Sensitization is an increase of hedonic response from continuous exposure, such as the increased pleasure and selectivity of connoisseurs for wine, or food. Brickman, Coates, and Janoff- Bulman were among the first to investigate the hedonic treadmill in their 1978 study, \\"Lottery Winners and Accident Victims: Is Happiness Relative?\\". Lottery winners and paraplegics were compared to a control group and as predicted, comparison (with past experiences and current communities) and habituation (to new circumstances) affected levels of happiness such that after the initial impact of the extremely positive or negative events, happiness levels typically went back to the average levels. This interview-based study, while not longitudinal, was the beginning of a now large body of work exploring the relativity of happiness. Brickman and Campbell originally implied that everyone returns to the same neutral set point after a significantly emotional life event. In the literature review, \\"Beyond the Hedonic Treadmill, Revising the Adaptation Theory of Well-Being\\" (2006), Diener, Lucas, and Scollon concluded that people are not hedonically neutral, and that individuals have different set points which are at least partially heritable. They also concluded that individuals may have more than one happiness set point, such as a life satisfaction set point and a subjective well being set point, and that because of this, one's level of happiness is not just one given set point but can vary within a given range. Diener and colleagues point to longitudinal and cross-sectional research to argue that happiness set point can change, and lastly that individuals vary in the rate and extent of adaptation they exhibit to change in circumstance. Empirical studies In a longitudinal study conducted by Mancini, Bonnano, and Clark, people showed individual differences in how they responded to significant life events, such as marriage, divorce and widowhood. They recognized that some individuals do experience substantial changes to their hedonic set point over time, though most others do not, and argue that happiness set point can be relatively stable throughout the course of an individual's life, but the life satisfaction and subjective well being set points are more variable. Similarly, the longitudinal study conducted by Fujita and Diener (2005) described the life satisfaction set point as a \\"soft baseline\\". This means that for most people, this baseline is similar to their happiness baseline. Typically, life satisfaction will hover around a set point for the majority of their lives and not change dramatically. However, for about a quarter of the population this set point is not stable, and does indeed move in response to a major life event. Other longitudinal data has shown that subjective well being set points do change over time, and that adaptation is not necessarily inevitable. In his archival data analysis, Lucas found evidence that it is possible for someone's subjective well-being set point to change drastically, such as in the case of individuals who acquire a severe, long term disability. However, as Diener, Lucas, and Scollon point out, the amount of fluctuation a person experiences around their set point is largely dependent on the individual's ability to adapt. After following over a thousand sets of twins for 10 years, Lykken and Tellegen (1996) concluded that almost 50% of our happiness levels are determined by genetics. Headey and Wearing (1989) suggested that our position on the spectrum of the stable personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, and openness to experience) accounts for how we experience and perceive life events, and indirectly contributes to our happiness levels. Research on happiness has spanned decades and crossed cultures in order to test the true limits of our hedonic set point. In recent large panel studies, divorce, death of a spouse, unemployment, disability, and similar events have been shown to change the long-term subjective well-being, even though some adaptation does occur and inborn factors affect this. In the aforementioned Brickman study (1978), researchers interviewed 22 lottery winners and 29 paraplegics to determine their change in happiness levels due to their given event (winning lottery or becoming paralyzed). The event in the case of lottery winners had taken place between one month and one and a half years before the study, and in the case of paraplegics between a month and a year. The group of lottery winners reported being similarly happy before and after the event, and expected to have a similar level of happiness in a couple of years. These findings show that having a large monetary gain had no effect on their baseline level of happiness, for both present and expected happiness in the future. They found that the paraplegics reported having a higher level of happiness in the past than the rest (due to a nostalgia effect), a lower level of happiness at the time of the study than the rest (although still above the middle point of the scale, that is, they reported being more happy than unhappy) and, surprisingly, they also expected to have similar levels of happiness than the rest in a couple of years. One must note that the paraplegics did have an initial decrease in life happiness, but the key to their findings is that they expected to eventually return to their baseline in time. In a newer study (2007), winning a medium-sized lottery prize had a lasting mental wellbeing effect of 1.4 GHQ points on Britons even two years after the event. Some research suggests that resilience to suffering is partly due to a decreased fear response in the amygdala and increased levels of BDNF in the brain. New genetic research have found that changing a gene could increase intelligence and resilience to depressing and traumatizing events.http://www.futuretimeline.net/blog/2015/08/17-2.htm#.VuviaVnD9qU Cites: This could have crucial benefits for those suffering from anxiety and PTSD. Recent research reveals certain types of brain training can increase brain size. The hippocampus volume can affect mood, hedonic setpoints, some forms of memory. A smaller hippocampus has been linked to depression and dysthymia. Certain activities and environmental factors can reset the hedonic setpoint and also grow the hippocampus to an extent. London taxi drivers' hippocampi grow on the job, and the drivers have a better memory than those who didn't become taxi drivers. In particular, the posterior hippocampus seemed to be the most important for enhanced mood and memory. Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, and Diener (2003) researched changes in baseline level of well-being due to changes in marital status, the birth of first child, and the loss of employment. While they found that a negative life event can have a greater impact on a person's psychological state and happiness set point than a positive event, they concluded that people completely adapt, finally returning to their baseline level of well-being, after divorce, losing a spouse, the birth of a child, and for women losing their job. They did not find a return to baseline for marriage or for layoffs in men. This study also illustrated that the amount of adaptation depends on the individual. Wildeman, Turney, and Schnittker (2014) studied the effects of imprisonment on one's baseline level of well-being. They researched how being in jail affects one's level of happiness both short term (while in prison) and long term (after being released). They found that being in prison has negative effects on one's baseline well-being; in other words one's baseline of happiness is lower in prison than when not in prison. Once people were released from prison, they were able to bounce back to their previous level of happiness.Christopher Wildeman, Kristin Turney, and Jason Schnittker, \\"The Hedonic Consequences of Punishment Revisited\\", 103 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 113. Silver (1982) researched the effects of a traumatic accident on one's baseline level of happiness. Silver found that accident victims were able to return to a happiness set point after a period of time. For eight weeks, Silver followed accident victims who had sustained severe spinal cord injuries. About a week after their accident, Silver observed that the victims were experiencing much stronger negative emotions than positive ones. By the eighth and final week, the victims' positive emotions outweighed their negative ones. The results of this study suggest that regardless of whether the life event is significantly negative or positive, people will almost always return to their happiness baseline.Silver (1982). Coping with an undesirable life event: A study of early reactions to physical disability. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Northwestern University. Fujita and Diener (2005) studied the stability of one's level of subjective well-being over time and found that for most people, there is a relatively small range in which their level of satisfaction varies. They asked a panel of 3,608 German residents to rate their current and overall satisfaction with life on a scale of 0-10, once a year for seventeen years. Only 25% of participants exhibited shifts in their level of life satisfaction over the course of the study, with just 9% of participants having experienced significant changes. They also found that those with a higher mean level of life satisfaction had more stable levels of life satisfaction than those with lower levels of satisfaction. Applications =Happiness set point= The concept of the happiness set point (proposed by Sonja Lyubomirsky) can be applied in clinical psychology to help patients return to their hedonic set point when negative events happen. Determining when someone is mentally distant from their happiness set point and what events trigger those changes can be extremely helpful in treating conditions such as depression. When a change occurs, clinical psychologists work with patients to recover from the depressive spell and return to their hedonic set point more quickly. Because acts of kindness often promote long-term well-being, one treatment method is to provide patients with different altruistic activities that can help a person raise his or her hedonic set point. This can in turn be helpful in reducing reckless habits in the pursuit of well-being. Further, helping patients understand that long-term happiness is relatively stable throughout one's life can help to ease anxiety surrounding impactful events. =Resilience research= Hedonic adaptation is also relevant to resilience research. Resilience is a \\"class of phenomena characterized by patterns of positive adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk,\\" meaning that resilience is largely the ability for one to remain at their hedonic setpoint while going through negative experiences. Psychologists have identified various factors that contribute to a person being resilient, such as positive attachment relationships (see Attachment Theory), positive self- perceptions, self-regulatory skills (see Emotional self-regulation), ties to prosocial organizations (see prosocial behavior), and a positive outlook on life.Masten, A. S., Cutuli, J. J., Herbers, J. E., & Reed, M.-G. J. (2009). Resilience in development. In C. R. Snyder & S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology, 2nd ed. (pp. 117–131). New York: Oxford University Press. These factors can contribute to maintaining a happiness set point even in the face of adversity or negative events. Critical views One critical point made regarding our individual set point is to understand it may simply be a genetic tendency and not a completely determined criterion for happiness, and it can still be influenced. In a study on moderate to excessive drug intake on rats, Ahmed and Koob (1998) sought to demonstrate that the use of mind-altering drugs such as cocaine could change an individual's hedonic set point. Their findings suggest that drug usage and addiction lead to neurochemical adaptations whereby a person needs more of that substance to feel the same levels of pleasure. Thus, drug abuse can have lasting impacts on one's hedonic set point, both in terms of overall happiness and with regard to pleasure felt from drug usage. Genetic roots of the hedonic set point are also disputed. Sosis (2014) has argued the \\"hedonic treadmill\\" interpretation of twin studies depends on dubious assumptions. Pairs of identical twins raised apart aren't necessarily raised in substantially different environments. The similarities between twins (such as intelligence or beauty) may invoke similar reactions from the environment. Thus, we might see a notable similarity in happiness levels between twins even though there aren't happiness genes governing affect levels. Further, hedonic adaptation may be a more common phenomenon when dealing with positive events as opposed to negative ones. Negativity bias, where people tend to focus more on negative emotions than positive emotions, can be an obstacle in raising one's happiness set point. Negative emotions often require more attention and are generally remembered better, overshadowing any positive experiences that may even outnumber negative experiences. Given that negative events hold more psychological power than positive ones, it may be difficult to create lasting positive change. Headey (2008) concluded that an internal locus of control and having \\"positive\\" personality traits (notably low neuroticism) are the two most significant factors affecting one's subjective well-being. Headey also found that adopting \\"non-zero sum\\" goals, those which enrich one's relationships with others and with society as a whole (i.e. family-oriented and altruistic goals), increase the level of subjective well-being. Conversely, attaching importance to zero-sum life goals (career success, wealth, and social status) will have a small but nevertheless statistically significant negative impact on people's overall subjective well-being (even though the size of a household's disposable income does have a small, positive impact on subjective well-being). Duration of one's education seems to have no direct bearing on life satisfaction. And, contradicting set point theory, Headey found no return to homeostasis after sustaining a disability or developing a chronic illness. These disabling events are permanent, and thus according to cognitive model of depression, may contribute to depressive thoughts and increase neuroticism (another factor found by Headey to diminish subjective well-being). Disability appears to be the single most important factor affecting human subjective well-being. The impact of disability on subjective well-being is almost twice as large as that of the second strongest factor affecting life satisfaction—the personality trait of neuroticism.

Located on the banks of the Chao Phraya River, the original structure was the first hotel built in Thailand when it opened as The Oriental in 1876. Today, the hotel is one of two flagship properties of Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. History When Siam opened to foreign trade after the signing of the Bowring Treaty the sailors that manned the ships which conveyed this trade though Bangkok required accommodation on shore. To meet this demand, Captain Dyers, an American and his partner J.E. Barnes opened a hotel called the Oriental Hotel. This burnt down in 1865.O'Nell. Page 176. Several years later a partnership of Danish captains opened a replacement hotel.Warren & Gocher. Page 120. In the 1870s the board of the Oriental Hotel decided with the opening of the new River Wing, upon 1876 as the official establishment date of the Oriental Hotel. =H. N. Andersen= In 1881 29-year-old Hans Niels Andersen, a Danish businessman, bought the premises.Augustin and Williamson. His various business ventures led to him becoming a much respected member of the Western community in Siam. Andersen identified a need for a respectable hotel with good accommodation, a bar and a western menu to meet the needs of travellers and businessmen visiting to Siam. Encouraged by Prince Prisdang Jumsai, Hans Niels Andersen formed a partnership with Peter Andersen and Frederick Kinch to build a luxury hotel. Designed by Cardu & Rossi, a team of local Italian architects, the Oriental was the first luxury hotel in Siam. The hotel opened on 19 May 1887 with 40 rooms and features which at the time had never been seen in Siam outside of a royal palace: a second floor (during a time of single-storey bungalows), carpeted hallways, smoking and ladies rooms, a billiards room and a bar capable of seating 50 patrons.O‘Nell. Page 178. To ensure the success of the restaurant and a satisfactory level of service the owners lured the chef and butler away from the French Consulate to work at the hotel. The first major event that the hotel hosted was a grand banquet on 24 May 1888 to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. After personally inspecting the hotel’s facilities in December 1890, King Chulalongkorn decided the hotel was up to the standard necessary to host visiting royalty. The hotel's first royal guests were the entourage of Crown Prince Nicholas of Russia, (later Tsar Nicholas) in April 1891. A succession of owners followed until Marie Maire took over the ownership in 1910. She immediately went to work revamping the hotel. She sold it in 1932. During the Second World War the hotel was leased to the Japanese Army who used it as an officers club (under the management of the Imperial Hotel of Tokyo). At the end of the war it was used to house liberated Allied prisoners of war, who in the belief that it was a Japanese property ransacked the building.O‘Nell. Page 181. =Germaine Krull= The original 19th century Authors' Wing At the end of the war a six- person partnership each contributed US$250 to buy the hotel, badly run down from its wartime service. The partnership consisted of Germaine Krull (1897–1985), Prince Bhanu, General Chai Prateepasen, Pote Sarasin (prominent businessman and lawyer) and John Webster and Jim Thompson, two Americans who had served in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and who had stayed on in Thailand. Krull took the position of manager in 1947, despite no prior experience in the hotel field. Born in Germany, she had been best known as a photographer during the 1920s before service in the Pacific as a war correspondent for Agence France Presse. The hotel's restoration and restocking offered Thompson an opportunity to put to use his architectural and artistic abilities. The hotel reopened for business on 12 June 1947. Krull turned out to be a natural hotelier and during her reign restored the hotel to its position as the premier hotel in Thailand. Thompson soon left the partnership over a plan to build a new wing, though he stayed on in residence at the hotel for some time. To compete with popular clubs and a new local bar called Chez Eve, Krull established the Bamboo Bar, which soon became one of the leading bars in Bangkok.Samuels. In 1958 the ten-storey Garden Wing was built. It featured the city’s first elevator and was home to the Le Normandie Restaurant. In 1967, fearful that Thailand would fall to the communists, Krull sold her share to Italthai which at the time was well on its way to becoming one of the country’s most significant mercantile groups eventually totally some 60 companies involved in almost all aspects of the Thai economy. =Italthai= Italthai had been founded in the mid-fifties by Giorgio Berlingieri, an Italian born in Genoa and Dr Chaijudh Karnasuta, a Thai. Berlingieri felt that the Oriental had begun to rest on its laurels and had dropped behind its competitors. He wanted to develop the Oriental into one of the best hotels in the world. Too involved with his various businesses to devote time to the project, Berlingieri in November 1967 appointed 30-year-old Kurt Wachtveitl (1937– ), at that time manager of Nipa Lodge (a hotel that Italthai owned in Pattaya), as general manager of the Oriental. In 1972 the hotel acquired an adjacent property upon which it erected the 350-room River Wing. =Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group and Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok= The Group began with the opening of its flagship property, The Mandarin, in Hong Kong in 1963, which soon built up a reputation for luxurious service. In 1974, Mandarin International Hotels Limited was formed as a hotel management company. The Group's intention was to expand into Asia and operate hotels with a standard of service comparable with their property in Hong Kong. In 1974 the company's hotel interests expanded further through the acquisition of a 49% interest in The Oriental, Bangkok. Through the management of both The Mandarin in Hong Kong and The Oriental, Bangkok, the Group was in an unusual position of having two \\"flagship\\" hotels. In 1985, the Company rationalized its corporate structure by combining these two properties under a common name, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. The hotel opened its renowned Oriental Spa in 1993 and finished a complete renovation of its rooms and suites in 2003. In 2006, The Oriental, Bangkok celebrated its 130th anniversary.

It is the successor to the ZEEP reactor. Designed by AECL for CANDU reactor support, the unit saw first criticality on 7 September 1960. The reactor is still operating at Chalk River where it is used for reactor physics and nuclear fuel research.  Description The ZED-2 is a low-power (200 W), tank-type (3.36 meter diameter, 3.35 meter high), heavy-water moderated reactor capable of a peak flux of 109 n/cm².s. Seven special Zirconium-alloy fuel assemblies are used and reactor control is via moderator level adjustment. Liquid (light or heavy water) and gas (CO2) coolants can be used and be heated to 300 °C at 8.6 MPa while the heavy water moderator can be heated or cooled independently of the coolant in the Zr assemblies. ZED-2 has also been used for definitive studies of the effects of heavy water and alternative ordinary (light) water and organic coolants. Sufficient CANFLEX (43-element) bundles are being built containing SEU fuel to provide \\"full-core\\" simulation for the Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR) project. In November 2010, the American Nuclear Society officially honoured the ZED-2 reactor with the title of 'nuclear historic landmark', recognising its 50 years of service and many contributions in the field of nuclear research and technology.

KZON airs a Hot Adult Contemporary radio format branded as \\"Hot 97.5/103.9\\" (simulcasting with KMVA 97.5 FM Dewey-Humboldt, Arizona). Its studios are located on 7th Street in Midtown Phoenix, while its transmitter is located in San Tan Valley, Arizona. It is owned by Riviera Broadcasting. History The station signed on the air on February 25, 1981 as KQEZ \\"Easy Country 103\\" in Coolidge, Arizona.Broadcasting Yearbook 1982 page C-11 It was powered at only 3,000 watts, a fraction of its current output, so the station primarily focused on the Casa Grande Valley. In 1991, original owner Larry E. Salsburey sold the station to Scott Christianson's Chriscom. KQEZ, however, fell on financial hard times in the early 1990s. In September 1992, KQEZ's disc jockeys informed listeners that they had not been paid in a month; at that time, owner Christianson said he could not pay workers because of $200,000 in debt. In April 1993, the station went off the air altogether. Two months later, the station was sold to J.M. Wolz, the first of three license transfers in a year. Wolz put the station back on the air with a classic rock format as KAZR. A signal upgrade followed providing the southern sections of the Phoenix, Arizona, area with a clear signal. On March 20, 1995, the format was flipped to a modern rock/top 40 hybrid branded as “The Blaze.” A change of call letters to KBZR followed the change of format. In the spring of 1996, the station began moving its transmitter closer to Phoenix. At the same time, the station began a 6-month stunt of an automated Rhythmic Oldies format, only going by the moniker \\"S.T.E.V.E.\\" The name was an acronym standing for \\"Songs That Everyone Vociferously Enjoys.\\" On October 30, 1996, at 3:30 p.m., the station completed its upgrade, and flipped to a hip hop-emphasizing rhythmic top 40 format as \\"103.9, Arizona's Party Station.\\" The call letters were changed in the spring of 1997 to KPTY to reflect the station branding. Despite the station's signal limitations, KPTY did well in the ratings. In fact, rival KKFR, which was airing a broad-based Mainstream Top 40 format at the time, began to move towards hip hop-emphasizing rhythmic top 40 format as well, and took away much of KPTY's audience. In 1998, KPTY evolved to a hybrid hip- hop/modern rock format shortly followed by a change of branding to \\"Party Radio @ 103.9.\\" During the last week of 1999, KPTY stunted with a supposed broadcast hijacking with buzzing sounds and audio glitches in the songs, legal IDs and sweepers, while the DJs were talking. On December 31, 1999, KPTY began stunting with a 24-hour loop of \\"We Like To Party\\" by The Vengaboys. On January 1, 2000, KPTY returned to a rhythmic top 40 format (this time with more of a dance lean) as \\"103.9 The Party\\". In October 2001, the station's owners were persuaded by the staff of the original KEDJ \\"The Edge\\" on 106.3 FM and 100.3 FM to drop the Rhythmic Top 40 format and bring the KEDJ call letters and its alternative rock format over to 103.9 FM. KPTY flipped to \\"The Edge\\" exactly 5 years after the station began: October 30, 2001 at Noon. The 106.3 and 100.3 frequencies originally used by \\"The Edge\\" were sold to Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation (now Univision Radio) and switched to a Regional Mexican format. In April 2008, the morning show \\"The Morning Ritual\\" was dropped in place of the syndicated Adam Carolla Show from Los Angeles. The Adam Carolla Show was cancelled on February 20, 2009, due to Carolla's flagship station KLSX-FM flipping formats. It was quickly replaced by another Los Angeles-based morning show, Kevin and Bean. In July 2009, the station relaunched as \\"FM/1039...Where Music Matters.\\" FM/1039 Launched under then- Program Director Tim Virgin. That same month, Virgin left to do Afternoons at Q101 in Chicago. Former program director Marc Young returned to the station and took over afternoon duties as well. On January 8, 2010, the \\"FM 103-9\\" branding was changed to \\"X 103-9...Alternative Rock Now.\\" On February 2, 2010, under the direction of Program Director Marc Young, the station's call letters were changed from KEDJ to KEXX to align with the \\"X 103.9\\" branding. On January 12, 2012, the station dropped alternative rock for classic rock under the name \\"My 103.9.\\" \\"Personal Jesus\\" by Depeche Mode was the last song under their alternative rock format. As of June 2012, the station turned to a Hot AC format, still under the name \\"My 103.9.\\" On December 27, 2013, Trumper Communications and Riviera Broadcasting Group announced that they would merge their Adult Top 40 outlets into one simulcast, with KMVA and KEXX becoming \\"Hot 97.5/103.9 Trending Radio.\\" The combined signals made their launch on December 31, 2013. On April 9, 2015, its HD2 digital subchannel became the high definition simulcast of KOAI 95.1 FM in Sun City West. On June 20, 2016, KEXX changed its call letters to KZON.

Early life and career Volkmer grew up in Jefferson City, Missouri, where he \\"got his start in politics helping his mother campaign in Jefferson City, Missouri, for the re- election of President Franklin Roosevelt.\\"Kopel, David (2011-04-18) Rep. Harold Volkmer, R.I.P., Volokh Conspiracy He attended Jefferson City Junior College and Saint Louis University. He later received his law degree from the University of Missouri, and passed the bar exam even before graduating. He married the former Shirley Ruth Braskett (died in 1995) in 1955, and they became the parents of two sons and a daughter. Volkmer served in the United States Army from 1955 to 1957. Prior to entering politics, Volkmer operated a private law practice in Hannibal, Missouri. Political career After graduating from law school, \\"Volkmer quickly entered public service, first as an Assistant Attorney General for the State, and then in the United States Army. He was elected Prosecuting Attorney for Marion County in 1960, and then State Representative in 1966.\\" Volkmer was re-elected to the Missouri House of Representatives four times. \\"During his ten years in the Missouri legislature, he earned the same reputation that he would have had in Congress. An 'energetic blunt-talking lawyer' and 'a maverick,' in the words of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Volkmer led the way on a major reorganization of the executive branch of state government. As the Republican minority leader later recalled, 'Volkmer was the brains for all of us. He understood the issue of reorganization better than anybody in the Legislature. We all looked to him for leadership, including me. I don’t like to say that, darn it, because he’s a Democrat. But it’s true.'\\" As Chairman of the Missouri House Judiciary Committee, Volkmer sought and obtained approval of the Equal Rights Amendment by the Missouri House of Representatives. In 1976, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives and was re-elected nine times. In Congress, Volkmer represented a mostly rural 21-county area in northeastern Missouri. He served on the House Agriculture Committee and helped shape five major farm bills. Volkmer also served for several of his early terms on the House Judiciary Committee. He had a reputation as a conservative Democrat due to his opposition to gun control legislation and his opposition to abortion. However, these highly salient political issues overshadowed Volkmer's more progressive stances on many issues involving civil rights, environmental laws, and education policy. For instance, he supported the extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1982, the extension and expansion of the Fair Housing Act in 1988, expansion and strengthening of various environmental laws including Superfund, the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act, and opposed certain Pentagon weapons programs considered by him to be wasteful and unnecessary. Volkmer also supported the Panama Canal Treaty Enabling Legislation in 1978, and the modernization of the United States Bankruptcy laws in 1978. Volkmer also supported the creation of the U.S. Department of Education. He was one of the primary sponsors of the 1986 McClure-Volkmer Act that came to be known as the Firearm Owners Protection Act. This act amended the Gun Control Act by creating an expanded system of rules and procedures with respect to compliance inspections of gun shops. According to legal scholar Dave Kopel, \\"Line by line, FOPA significantly strengthened statutory protections of the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments. FOPA remains one of the most far- reaching laws ever enacted by Congress to safeguard constitutional rights.\\" For most of his tenure, Volkmer usually skated to reelection. From 1978 to 1990, he only faced one close race, in 1984.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=12332 In 1992, however, he was nearly defeated by Republican Rick Hardy, a political science professor at MU, surviving by only 5,800 votes.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28152 He faced an equally close race in 1994, when Republican assistant attorney general Kenny Hulshof held him to 50.4 percent of the vote.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28152 He lost a rematch to Hulshof in 1996 by just under 5,900 votes.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=29618 Since then, the Democrats have cracked the 40 percent barrier in the district, now numbered as the 3rd District, only once. After leaving Congress, Volkmer served as chairman of the National Commission on Small Farms, and \\"the members of the National Rifle Association overwhelmingly elected him to their Board of Directors, on which he served for the next 12 years.\\" Volkmer resided in Hannibal, Missouri until his death at age 80 from pneumonia on April 16, 2011.

Early life Born in Tarnów, Austria-Hungary (now Poland), he earned his PhD from the University of Rome in 1929, then went to the University of Chicago where he was a professor of Assyriology until his death. Contribution Although writing systems have been studied for centuries by linguists, Gelb is widely regarded as the first scientific practitioner of the study of scripts, and coined the term grammatology to refer to the study of writing systems. In A Study of Writing (1952), he suggested that scripts evolve in a single direction, from logographic scripts to syllabaries to alphabets. This historical typology has been criticized as overly simplistic, forcing the data to fit the model and ignoring exceptional cases. Yet, despite more recent refinements of the typology by Peter T. Daniels and others, Gelb's rigorous study of the properties of different kinds of writing system was pioneering and innovative. Gelb had contributed significantly to the decipherment of the Anatolian hieroglyphs (formerly often referred to as 'Hittite hieroglyphs'), having published 3 volumes of studies on the subject.Albrecht Goetze, Hittite Hieroglyphs III by Ignace J. Gelb. Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 64, No. 2 (Apr. - Jun., 1944), pp. 84-86 In the course of his career, he published over 20 books, that have been translated into many languages, and over 250 scientific articles. View of the Maya Gelb believed that the Maya hieroglyphs did not qualify as true writing capable of representing language, which has now been disproven following the decipherment of the Maya script. Work in Assyriology Gelb's work in Assyriology focused on publishing editions of Akkadian texts and a grammar and dictionary of Old Akkadian. He became editor of the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary in 1947 and continued work on the project until his death. His other important works include works on Mesopotamian land tenure and sales, metrology, and other aspects of economic and social history. Gelb, supported by Assyriologist Aage Westenholz, differentiated three stages of Old Akkadian: that of the pre-Sargonic era, that of the Akkadian empire, and that of the \\"Neo-Sumerian Renaissance\\" that followed it. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1968) and of the British Academy (1978), a member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, and in 1975 he was elected as a member of the prestigious American Philosophical Society. Additionally, from 1965 to 1966 he was president of the American Oriental Society. Notes References * Leichty, Erle. 1998. Ignace J. Gelb (14 October 1907 - 22 December 1985).

It was first broadcast on NBC and then shown on British television on Channel 4. Tina Majorino played the lead role of Alice and a number of well-known performers portrayed the eccentric characters whom Alice meets during the course of the story, including Ben Kingsley, Martin Short, Whoopi Goldberg, Peter Ustinov, Christopher Lloyd, Gene Wilder, George Wendt, Robbie Coltrane and Miranda Richardson. The film won four Emmy Awards in the categories of costume design, makeup, music composition and visual effects. Plot The film follows the storyline of the book closely, save for adding some scenes from Through the Looking-Glass. It also changes the opening real world scene from Alice and her sister sitting at a riverbank to Alice in her bedroom, reluctantly practicing the song \\"Cherry Ripe\\", which she is expected to perform at a garden party. (The party guests are played by the same actors as the Wonderland characters and are shown as resembling them in appearance and personality, in a similar manner to the MGM version of The Wizard of Oz. The toys in Alice's room also reflect the residents of Wonderland). Thanks to stage fright and constant nagging from her confident governess (Dilys Laye), Alice runs out of the house and hides herself in the woods nearby, planning to stay hidden until the party has ended. However, an apple floats down from the tree and seems to hover in Alice's face. She is suddenly distracted by a human-sized White Rabbit (voiced by Richard Coombs) rushing by. Curious, Alice follows the White Rabbit, falling down his rabbit hole and ending up in Wonderland. Alice travels throughout Wonderland, meeting a large number of bizarre people and challenges. Alice first has problems keeping her size the same while attempting to go through a small door leading to a beautiful garden, growing massively tall and flooding the room she is in with her tears before shrinking to the size of a mouse. She then meets Mr. Mouse (Ken Dodd) and his avian friends who participate in a Caucus Race, where everyone wins. Alice encounters the White Rabbit again who directs her to his house. There, Alice comes across a bottle of liquid that makes her enormous and leaves her trapped in the house. The White Rabbit and his gardeners Pat (Jason Byrne) and Bill (Paddy Joyce) attempt to remove Alice by going down the chimney, but Alice shrinks again. Wandering in a forest, she encounters Major Caterpillar (Ben Kingsley) who advises her to not be afraid before transforming into a butterfly. Alice grows back to normal size by eating part of a mushroom. She ventures to a nearby manor house where she meets the musical Duchess (Elizabeth Spriggs), her baby, her pepper-obsessed plate-throwing cook (Sheila Hancock) and the Cheshire Cat (Whoopi Goldberg). The baby is left in Alice's care but it turns into a pig and is released. The Cheshire Cat advises Alice to visit the Mad Hatter and his friends the March Hare and the Dormouse. Meeting the trio at a tea party, Alice is given rather odd advice on how to avoid stagefright, with the Mad Hatter (Martin Short) leaping onto the table to do his performance he previously did at a concert of the Queen of Hearts, the Queen eventually didn't enjoy the performance by quoting it's \\"murdering the tune\\" and ordered him to be executed. But the Hatter escapes being decapitated which upsets Time (who referred to as a 'he' and was once a close friend to the Hatter) and punished the three by stopping \\"himself\\" so they will have a never-ending tea party. Alice eventually leaves when the Mad Hatter and March Hare begin smashing cups and plates. They also try stuffing the unfortunate Dormouse into a teapot. She comes across the small door and using her intelligence, succeeds in getting through it into the garden which is actually the labyrinth maze belonging to the Queen. The Queen of Hearts (Miranda Richardson) invites her to a bizarre game of croquet, but her love for decapitating people annoys Alice. The Cheshire Cat's head appears in the sky and is ordered to be executed, but reasoning from Alice stops the Queen. The Duchess arrives to answer the King's question of who the Cat's owner is, but the Cat has vanished. Alice leaves the croquet game, meeting the Gryphon (voiced by Donald Sinden) and the Mock Turtle (Gene Wilder). The two sing with Alice, teaching her the Lobster Quadrille and encouraging her. Alice then wanders into a darker area of Wonderland, meeting a White Knight (Christopher Lloyd) who encourages her to be brave and also shows her his newest invention. Alice meets some talking flowers: a Tiger-Lily (voiced by Joanna Lumley) who is the most sensible out of all of them, some Roses which are not too bothered about Alice being lost and some Daisies who are rascals. Having the flowers helping her, Alice walks off. Alice then meets Tweedledum (Robbie Coltrane) and Tweedledee (George Wendt) who have some antics with her before getting into a fight over a dropped rattle. Alice is then captured by a pair of card soldiers and taken to the royal court where the Knave of Hearts (Jason Flemyng) is put on trial for apparently stealing the Queen's jam tarts. The Mad Hatter and his companions appear as witnesses but he is accused of stealing someone else's hat and is recognized by the Queen for singing at her concert, prompting him to sing his Twinkle Song. Alice is then called to the stand but she uses some mushroom pieces to grow to great heights. She sees the jam tarts have been untouched and the trial is pointless. She openly criticizes the Queen, the King and Wonderland. The White Rabbit, who is present at the court, reveals he deliberately lured Alice into Wonderland to conquer her fears. He does so by first asking her if she is self-confident. Upon Alice answering yes, he simply states, \\"then you don't need us anymore.\\" He then sends her back home using the same hovering apple that brought her there in the first place. Awakening back home, Alice courageously sings in front of her parents and their guests, but instead of singing Cherry Ripe, she sings the Lobster Quadrille which she finds much more interesting. The audience enjoy her performance to Alice's happiness. Alice spots the Cheshire Cat in the audience, who smiles at her in congratulations. Cast * Tina Majorino as Alice – A curious young girl who is nervous and unenthused about performing the song Cherry Ripe at her parents' party in the beginning of the film. After her adventures in Wonderland, she finds the confidence to sing. However, instead of \\"Cherry Ripe,\\" she sings the Lobster Quadrille (a song that the Mock Turtle taught her). All the party guests love her performance and she even spots the Cheshire Cat in the audience who grins at her in a term of congratulations. * Miranda Richardson as Queen of Hearts – A childish queen whose only way of dealing with anger is to shout \\"Off with their heads!\\" She occasionally screams in a very high pitch as a persuasive tactic.

He informs Alice that he once sung the same piece during the Queen's concert, but was sent away because she was offended by his performance. The Mad Hatter was also called as a witness to the Knave's trial, where he reprised his performance, further angering the queen and causing her to chase him away as she shouted \\"off with his head!\\" Presumably, the Mad Hatter was beheaded soon after. * Whoopi Goldberg as the Cheshire Cat – A grinning cat who teaches Alice \\"the rules\\" of Wonderland. He was also one of the few characters who was nice to Alice.

It is found in three styles named after the location where they are performed, i.e. the Purulia Chau of Bengal, the Seraikella Chau of Jharkhand, and the Mayurbhanj Chau of Odisha. The dance ranges from celebrating martial arts, acrobatics and athletics performed in festive themes of a folk dance, to a structured dance with religious themes found in Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism. The costumes vary between the styles, with Purulia and Serakeilla using masks to identify the character. The stories enacted by Chhau dancers include those from the Hindu epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the Puranas and other Indian literature. The dance is traditionally an all males troupe, regionally celebrated particularly during spring every year, and may be a syncretic dance form that emerged from a fusion of classical Hindu dances and the traditions of ancient regional tribes. The dance is amazing and brings together people from diverse socio- economic backgrounds in a festive and religious spirit. Etymology Chhau is a folk dance of Rarh region. It may have been derived from Sanskrit Chāya (shadow, image or mask). Others link it to the Sanskrit root Chadma (disguise), yet others such as Sitakant Mahapatra suggest it is derived from Chhauni (military camp, armor, stealth) in Odia language.Claus, p. 109 A Chhau dancer in Bagmundi in role of goddess Durga.  Features of Chhau  A Shaktism themed costumes for Chhau dance (Durga with Lion, Purulia style Chhau). The Chhau dance is mainly performed during festivals in the region of Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha, especially the spring festival of Chaitra Parva and in which the whole community participates. The Purulia Chhau dance is celebrated during the Sun festival. Artistes from Purulia district of West Bengal performs Chhau dance Masks form an integral part of Chhau dance in Purulia and Seraikella styles. The knowledge of dance, music and mask-making is transmitted orally.From: NOMINATION FILE NO. 00337 FOR INSCRIPTION ON THE REPRESENTATIVE LIST OF THE INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE IN 2010, UNESCO 2010 The Chhau dance found in northern Odisha does not use mask during the dance, but they do when the artists first appear on the stage for introduction to the audience. The two styles of Chhau dance that use masks, blend within it forms of both dance and martial practices employing mock combat techniques (called khel), stylized gaits of birds and animals (called chalis and topkas) and movements based on the chores of village housewives (called uflis). This form of the Chhau dance, states Mohan Khokar, has no ritual or ceremonial meaning, it is a form of community celebration and entertainment. The dance is performed by male dancers, at night in an open space, called akhada or asar. The dance is rhythmic and set to traditional folk music, played on the reed pipes mohuri and shehnai. A variety of drums accompany the music ensemble including the dhol (a cylindrical drum), dhumsa (a large kettle drum) and kharka or chad-chadi. The themes for these dances include local legends, folklore and episodes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata and other abstract themes.Chhau dance UNESCO, Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity The precursors of Chhau dance (especially Purulia style) were not only Paika and Natua, but Nachni dance also played an important role in giving Chhau its present identity. Chhau dance borrows the female gaits and movements from the Nachni dance almost exclusively (Bhattacharya, 1983, Chakravarti, 2001, Kishore, 1985). The female dance elements in Chhau introduced the aspects of Lasya Bhava from the Natya Shastra that brought elegance, sensuality, and beauty in the dance form, whereas, the virile male dance movement is attributed to the Shiva’s tandava style of dance (Bose 1991). There are different interpretations to tandava and lasya. I have above- mentioned the most commonly accepted definition of tandava and lasya above. Bose foregrounds the debate between the relation of lasya and tandava critically in his analysis of dance in Sanskrit texts. See Bose, Mandakranta.Movement and Mimesis: The Idea of Dance in the Sanskritic Tradition. Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1991.  Three styles of Chhau  Ileana Citaristi performing Mayurbhanj Chhau (Shaivism theme). The Seraikella Chhau developed in Seraikela, the present day administrative headquarters of the Seraikela Kharsawan district of Jharkhand, the Purulia Chhau in Purulia district of West Bengal and the Mayurbhanj Chhau in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha. The most prominent difference among the three subgenres is regarding the use of masks. While, the Seraikela and Purulia subgenres of Chhau use masks during the dance, the Mayurbhanj Chhau uses none.Claus, p. 110 The Seraikella Chhau's technique and repertoire were developed by the erstwhile nobility of this region who were both its performers and choreographers, and in the modern era people from all backgrounds dance it. The Seraikella Chhau is performed with symbolic masks, and the acting establishes the role the actor is playing. The Purulia Chhau uses extensive masks shaped in the form of the character being played; for example, a lion character has a face mask of lion and body costumes too with the actor walking on all fours. These masks are crafted by potters who make clay images of Hindu gods and goddesses and is primarily sourced from the Purulia district of West Bengal. In the Mayurbhanj Chhau is performed without masks and is technically similar to the Seraikella Chhau. Recognition In 2010 the Chhau dance was inscribed in the UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011 title=Intangible Heritage Lists The Government of Odisha established the Government Chhau Dance Centre in 1960 in Seraikella and the Mayurbhanj Chhau Nritya Pratisthan at Baripada in 1962. These institutions engage in training involving local gurus, artists, patrons and representatives of Chhau institutions and sponsor performances. The Chaitra Parva festival, significant to the Chhau Dance, is also sponsored by the state government. The Sangeet Natak Akademi has established a National Centre for Chhau Dance at Baripada, Odisha.  In popular culture  The Hindi film Barfi! has several scenes that features the Purulia Chhau in it.  Chhau mask  Purulia Chhau Dance is listed on UNESCO's world heritage list of dances. The main difference between the Purulia Chhau and Odisha Chhau is in the use of the mask. Purulia Chhau uses masks in dance, but Odisha does not have masks thereby adding facial expression with body movements and gestures. Traditionally, the chhau dance is held during mid-march when one agricultural circle ends and a new circle begins. Purulia Chhau dancers wear the earthy and theatrical mask which represent the mythological characters. After making the shape of mask with clay, it is coloured and decorated with Shola and other things. Chhau Mask of West Bengal in Indian Stamp, 2017 The Chhau mask of Purulia is registered under Geographical Indications. As the basic difference of Purulia Chhau the mask is unique and traditional. These chhau masks are made by the artists by the Sutradhar community. The making of a mask goes through various stages. 8-10 layers of soft paper, immersed in diluted glue, are pasted one after another on the mould before the mud mould is dusted with fine ash powder. The facial features are made of clay. A special layer of mud and cloth is applied and the mask is then sun-dried. After this, the mould is polished and the second round of sun drying is done before separating the layers of cloth and paper from the mould. After finishing and drilling of holes for the nose and eyes, the mask is colored and decorated.https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5590e1c1e4b01cfd84ef7264/t/56bd94ae7da24fd5476fbc2e/1455264959070/Masks+of+Bengal.pdf Gallery File:Chhau Nritya (2).jpgChhau dance artist-female File:Chhau Nritya (3).jpgChhau dance artist-male File:Chhau Nritya (4).jpgChhau dance artist-male File:Chhau Nritya (5).jpgChhau dance artists File:Chhau Nritya (6).jpgChhau dance artist File:Chhau Dancers.jpgChhau Dancers in a village of Jharkhand File:Chhau dancer demon mask.jpgChhau dancer with demon mask performing at night File:Traditional chhau dancer.jpgA chhau dancer performing among the villagers in Jharkhand File:Mayurbhanj Chhau music troupe performing.jpgA Mayurbhanj Chhau music troupe performing Notes References * Asutosh Bhattacharya, Chhau dance of Purulia.

Similar designs have now been widely adopted by different manufacturers. Amplifier The covered products use a class-D amplifier combined with proprietary techniques to control the pulse width modulation to produce what is claimed to be better performance than other class-D amplifier designs. Among the publicly disclosed differences is real time control of the switching frequency depending on the input signal and amplified output. One of the amplifiers, the TA2020, was named one of the twenty-five chips that 'shook the world\\" by the IEEE Spectrum magazine. The control signals in Class T amplifiers may be computed using digital signal processing or fully analog techniques. Currently available implementations use a loop similar to a higher order Delta-Sigma (ΔΣ) (or sigma-delta) modulator, with an internal digital clock to control the sample comparator. The two key aspects of this topology are that (1), feedback is taken directly from the switching node rather than the filtered output, and (2), the higher order loop provides much higher loop gain at high audio frequencies than would be possible in a conventional single pole amplifier.

The instrument became extinct sometime in the Ming Dynasty. It has been revived in the 20th century as a double bridge harp; the modern version of the instrument does not resemble the ancient one, but its shape is similar to Western concert harps. History Woman playing konghou, details of a painting by Qiu Ying, Ming Dynasty. The wo-konghou, or horizontal konghou, was first mentioned in written texts in the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BC). The su-konghou, or vertical konghou first appeared in the Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220AD). The phoenix-headed konghou was introduced from India in the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317–420 AD). The konghou was used to play yayue (court music) in the Kingdom of Chu. During the Han Dynasty (206 BC–220 AD) the konghou was used in qingshangyue (a music genre). Beginning in the Sui Dynasty (581–618), the konghou was also used in yanyue (banquet music). Konghou playing was most prevalent in the Sui and Tang dynasties. It was generally played in rites and ceremonies and gradually prevailed among the ordinary people. In other places The instrument was adopted in the ancient times in Korea, where it was called gonghu (hangul: 공후; hanja: 箜篌), but it is no longer used there. There were three subtypes according to shape: *Sogonghu (hangul: 소공후; hanja: 小箜篌; literally \\"small harp\\")photo *Sugonghu (hangul: 수공후; hanja: 豎箜篌; literally \\"vertical harp\\")photo *Wagonghu (hangul: 와공후; hanja: 臥箜篌; literally \\"lying down harp\\")photo date=November 2014 Similarly, the kudaragoto (百済琴 / くだらごと), also called kugo (箜篌 / くご) of Japan was in use in some Togaku (Tang music) performances during the Nara period, but seems to have died out by the 10th century. It has recently been revived in Japan, and the Japanese composer Mamoru Fujieda has composed for it. Tomoko Sugawara commissioned a playable kugo harp from builder Bill Campbell and earned an Independent Music Awards nomination for her 2010 album, Along the Silk Road, playing traditional and newly written works for the instrument. Modern konghou The konghou was \\"revived\\" in the 20th century and this instrument resembles a Western concert harp. The main feature that distinguishes the contemporary konghou from the Western harp is that the modern konghous strings are folded over to make two rows, which enables players to use advanced playing techniques such as vibrato and bending tones. Paired strings on opposite sides of the instrument are tuned to the same note. They start from a tuning peg and beyond the playing area travel over two bridges on opposite sides of the instrument, and are then fixed at the far end to opposite sides of a freely moving lever so that depressing one of the string pairs raises the pitch of the other. The two rows of strings also make it suitable for playing swift rhythms and overtones.

Apocalypse manuscripts were generally made in three different time periods: Carolingian, Ottonian, and Romanesque. The Bamberg Apocalypse belongs in the category of Ottonian Apocalypses. The Apocalypse was becoming important theme not only to the elites but to the common believer during this period. Christians believed in the idea of Doomsday and believed it to be occurring during their era. = Patron = Many scholars debate over the patron of the Bamberg Apocalypse. It may have been commissioned by Otto III, who died suddenly in 1002, or by Henry II who may have found the unfinished work at the scriptorium and ordered its completion. Henry II, along with his wife, Cunigunde, donated the manuscript to the newly established Collegiate Abbey of St. Stephan at Bamberg.  Description  = Materials = The manuscript has 106 folios and is illuminated with 57 gilded miniatures and over 100 gilded initials. The dimensions of this illuminated manuscript is 29.5 x 20.5 cm In 2003 it, along with other Ottonian manuscripts produced at Reichenau, was added to the UNESCO Memory of the World International Register. = Illuminations = alt= alt= The style of the Bamberg Apocalypse is closely related to other Reichenau manuscripts including the Pericopes of Henry II and the Munich Gospels of Otto III. The Bamberg Apocalypse has attracted the attention of many scholars for its rich imagery and text. The Bamberg Apocalypse contains fifty miniatures in various sizes juxtaposed with Biblical text. There is a generous amount of gold in the background with figures in performative poses. This manuscript is also noted for the gestures used in the figurative narrative, especially in the hands. The iconography used in this manuscript can be traced to Valenceiennes influence. However, the Bamberg Apocalypse stands out on its own for its innovative representations of biblical text. For example, this manuscript is credited to being the first surviving representation of the Last Judgement within a manuscript. On Folio 27v of the Bamberg Apocalypse is the first full depiction of Revelation 11 with a narrative divided into three key scenes. The figures on the top preach as the beast attacks two witness that then get resurrected on the bottom right register. The Bamberg Apocalyse is the only extant illustrated Ottonian Apocalypse manuscript.  Notes   References  * Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2012).

Fictional character biography =Anton Vanko= Anton Vanko (), the first Crimson Dynamo, was also the armor's creator. A Soviet scientist of Armenian birth with a Ph.D in Physics, Vanko was one of the world's foremost experts on electricity. At the behest of the USSR, Vanko built a powered exoskeleton capable of performing incredible feats. He also designed the Unicorn's helmet and instructed the Russian agent in its use.Tales of Suspense #56 As the Crimson Dynamo, Vanko was sent by the Soviet Government to sabotage Stark Industries and defeat his American counterpart Iron Man in battle.Tales of Suspense #46 Vanko's armor allowed him to generate and control electricity in all of its forms, such as firing devastating bolts of lightning and flying using electromagnetic propulsion. Unlike Iron Man, who at the time had to regularly charge the chest plate powering his suit (and keeping him alive), the Crimson Dynamo was powered by a self-sustaining generator. After losing to Iron Man, Vanko defected to the United States out of fear that his superiors would kill him for failing. Vanko began to work for Tony Stark as one of his chief scientists. Eventually, the two became friends and Vanko developed pride and admiration for his new home. Unfortunately, soon the Soviets came for Vanko, just as he predicted. The KGB sent their top agent Black Widow as well as Boris Turgenev to apprehend him. Vanko died saving Iron Man by firing an unstable, experimental laser pistol at Turgenev, killing himself in the process.Tales of Suspense #52 =Boris Turgenov= Boris Turgenov, the second Crimson Dynamo, had a very short career as a supervillain. Turgenov came to the United States with the Black Widow to kill Anton Vanko, Tony Stark and Iron Man (at the time Stark kept his identity secret, with Iron Man posing as his most trusted bodyguard - Turgenov believed them to be separate people and planned to kill both). Turgenov almost carried out his mission, virtually defeating Iron Man with the stolen Crimson Dynamo suit. He was killed when Vanko sacrificed his own life for the cause of freedom by firing an experimental and unstable laser pistol at Boris. Both Vanko's heroic sacrifice and Turgenov's death were revisited in the Iron Man miniseries Enter the Mandarin, where it is revealed that Temugin (the Mandarin's son) witnessed the event. =Alexander Nevsky= Alexander Nevsky was Anton Vanko's up-and-coming protege, with a greatly admired and respected scientific genius. However, his promising career was ruined when the Soviet government discredited Vanko after he fled to the West. Sent into exile for his association with the turncoat, Nevsky grew to hate the Soviet Union as well as Iron Man for besting Vanko. Nevsky also sought vengeance against Tony Stark, whom Nevsky felt exploited Vanko under the American capitalist system (not knowing that Stark and Iron Man are the same person). Disguised as brilliant new scientist Alex Niven behind Cord Industries, he planned to help the struggling competitor beat out Stark Industries in the marketplace.Iron Man volume 1 #15 From there, Nevsky used a new and improved Crimson Dynamo armor and bested Iron Man. Finally, he worked towards undermining Tony Stark by romancing Janice Cord, Stark's girlfriend at the time and the daughter of Cord Industries's CEO. After he donned the Crimson Dynamo armor in public,Iron Man #21 his old Soviet masters sent the Titanium Man to kill him. When Titanium Man killed Janice, Nevsky blamed Iron Man for the tragedy and swore to avenge her.Iron Man #22 Although he held Titanium Man just as responsible for Janice's death, Nevsky was forced by circumstance to partner with him and Radioactive Man in Vietnam, where all three Communist-aligned fugitives formed the Titanic Three.Avengers #130 After defecting to Vietnam, Nevsky made one final attempt to kill Iron Man and was once again unsuccessful.Iron Man #73 As a result, he was found and assassinated by the KGB and they confiscated his armor for their own purposes.According to the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe \\"The Beginning of the End,\\"—Nevsky's original story arc in Iron Man #17-23—is considered one of the best Iron Man stories and, alongside Tony Stark's origin in Tales of Suspense #39, the best Iron Man story of the Silver Age of Comics.http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/05/03/the-25-greatest- iron-man-stories-ever- told/2/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/02/top-25-iron-man- stories?page=2http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/04/iron-mans-greatest- stories =Yuri Petrovich= Yuri Petrovich, the fourth Crimson Dynamo, first appeared in Champions #7 (Aug. 1976) as the son of Ivan Petrovich - a friend of the Black Widow (now-reformed). When Western agents (presumably Americans) failed to convince Ivan to defect to the West, they assassinated Yuri's mother; in the chaos that followed, Ivan and Yuri each believed the other dead. Yuri was brought to the West, where Soviet agents posing as Westerners indoctrinated him to hate the West. When Black Widow and Ivan defected to the United States, Yuri was \\"rescued\\" by the Soviets, returned to Russia, and trained as a KGB assassin. He was given the Crimson Dynamo armor and sent to kill the Black Widow and Ivan. Yuri and his allies (his girlfriend Darkstar, the Griffin, Rampage, and the original Titanium Man) fought the Black Widow and her teammates, the Champions. When Yuri learned of the true nature of his \\"Western\\" captors, he went berserk. Darkstar teamed up with the Champions to subdue Yuri, and after he and his other allies were defeated, Yuri was returned to Russia, convicted by the Soviet government, and exiled to a Siberian labor camp.Champions #8-10 =Dmitri Bukharin= Dmitri Bukharin as the fifth Crimson Dynamo. Dmitri Bukharin, the fifth Crimson Dynamo, was given Yuri Petrovich's armor by his masters in the KGB. He joined the Soviet Super- Soldiers, but was expelled after his teammates decided to sever their connections to the Soviet government. Afterward, he received a new, redesigned suit of armor.Behind the scenes between Secret Wars II #7 and X-Factor Annual #1. He later joined the Supreme Soviets, a group of superhumans who were loyal to the Soviet government; the group became the People's Protectorate after the USSR dissolved. When the new government confiscated his armor, he was given another suit and adopted the codename Airstrike. By the events of Dark Reign, however, he had returned to the identity and armor of the Crimson Dynamo, albeit as an ally of Iron Man instead of an enemy. He is currently a member of the Winter Guard, a Russian counterpart of the Avengers. Bukharin's tenure is the longest of anyone in the Crimson Dynamo's publication history, and occurred during such seminal Iron Man storylines as \\"Demon in a Bottle\\", \\"Doomquest\\", and \\"Armor Wars\\". As a result, Bukharin's Crimson Dynamo is considered by some to be the definitive version of the character. =Valentin Shatalov= Valentin Shatalov, a Colonel-General in the Soviet Army and a KGB agent, is the sixth Crimson Dynamo. He used his rank to obtain the Crimson Dynamo armor from Dmitri Bukharin for his own use. He was the founder of Remont-4, a group of Russian superhumans who sought to return the Soviet Union to Stalinism. Shatalov and his allies (the cyborg Firefox and the original Unicorn among others) recruited the original Titanium Man to their cause. The Remont-4 fought the Soviet Super Soldiers and a group of Russian mutant exiles in addition to plaguing Iron Man.Iron Man #255 In Shatalov's first appearance as the Crimson Dynamo, he was in a training session with Devastator in Russia at the same time Iron Man had encountered an out-of-control mutant dubbing himself Freak Quincy in Los Angeles. Quincy's out-of-control powers tapped into Devastator's satellite uplink from the other side of the world, and he managed to switch the minds of Stark and Shatalov. His unfamiliarity with the Iron Man armor resulted in Shatalov firing pulse bolts that destroyed Quincy's arms, although the mutant survived. After Stark and Shatalov struggled to maintain each other's identities, Shatalov was able to get the hospitalized Quincy to recreate the transmission that switched their minds. Out of respect for Stark, Shatalov did not reveal Stark's identity.Iron Man #316 Sometime after the fall of the Soviet Union, Shatalov received an upgraded Crimson Dynamo armor, less bulky than Bukharin's model, and with silver accents, this was the first Crimson Dynamo armor that was not completely crimson. Shatalov later met Tony Stark in person, when the latter traveled to Russia to oversee the opening of the first Stark Enterprises branch in the country, and revealed to Stark that he had kept his identity as Iron Man a secret. Stark's trip to Russia was interrupted by the rampage of the Titanium Man, Boris Bullski, who still could not accept the new Russia, and saw Stark's presence in his homeland as an affront to everything he believed the U.S.S.R. stood for. As the Titanium Man fought Iron Man, the Black Widow, and the Crimson Dynamo, Shatalov's leg was broken. He begged Iron Man not to finish the fight with Bullski, as he felt having the American Avenger take down a former Soviet hero would be too damaging to his country's morale. Stark volunteered to wear the Dynamo armor in Shatalov's place, and with radio assistance from Shatalov and the Widow, fought Bullski. When Bullski refused to surrender, Shatalov overrode Stark's control of the Dynamo armor, firing a blast that killed Bullski. Shatalov took the fall with his superiors, who had wanted to recover Bullski alive, and he was relieved of his duties as Crimson Dynamo.Iron Man #317 =Other Crimson Dynamos= Like many of Iron Man's Cold War-era villains, the Crimson Dynamo fell into a degree of obscurity after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Since Shatalov, there have been seven people to bear the Crimson Dynamo mantle, almost all of them anonymous, short-lived or otherwise unremarkable foes. The seventh Crimson Dynamo, Gregar Valski, was defeated by Nick Fury and Captain America.Captain America vol. 3, #42 He wore Dmitri Bukharin's former armor, though his skill piloting it was minimal. In Marvel Epic's six issue 2003 series Crimson Dynamo, Russian collegiate Gennady Gavrilov became the eighth Crimson Dynamo after he found the helmet of a \\"Beta unit\\" designed by Anton Vanko based on but improved over the original, with its very own recharging satellite in orbit. Believing the helmet to be a sophisticated gaming system, Gavrilov caused the dormant armor to awaken and make its way towards the helmet, inadvertently leaving a trail of destruction. He would eventually, if briefly, wear the entire armor in a standoff with the Russian military. He kept the armor afterward.Crimson Dynamo #1-6 The ninth Crimson Dynamo appeared in the Secret War miniseries as a member of Lucia von Bardas's army of villains which she gathered to defeat the Avengers. This Crimson Dynamo's armor was created by the Tinkerer.Secret War #3 The tenth Crimson Dynamo is introduced in Iron Man vol. 4, #7 (June 2006) where he is apprehended by Iron Man after attempting to rob a bank. It was later revealed that this armor had been bought on the black market, and that the designs for Crimson Dynamo-based technology have been for sale for a while.Iron Man vol. 4, #7 This Crimson Dynamo was later slain by the Punisher. The eleventh Crimson Dynamo was a member of the \\"Alpha Gen Soviet Super-Soldiers\\", a group of Russian superhumans put into cryogenic stasis after the Cold War ended. During a fight between the Order and the Infernal Man, Order member Corona set off an enormous explosion which awakened the Super-Soldiers. This Crimson Dynamo was apparently destroyed by Order members Supernaut and Aralune.The Order #2 Boris Vadim, the twelfth Crimson Dynamo, first appears in the premiere issue of Hulk vol. 2 (March 2008). A S.H.I.E.L.D.-sanctioned team consisting of Iron Man, Doc Samson and She-Hulk encounters the Winter Guard, a Russian superhero team of which Vadim is a member, while investigating the apparent murder of the Abomination in Russia.Hulk #1 In War Machine: Weapon of SHIELD, Vadim was seen ignoring orders from his superiors and helping War Machine defeat invading Skrulls.Invincible Iron Man #35 He later flees to the United States seeking political asylum, joining the Red Hulk's mercenary group.Hulk #14 Some time later, while battling the mutated Igor Drenkov, Vadim was devoured.Hulk: Winter Guard #0 Galina Nemirovsky replaced Boris Vadim to become the thirteenth Crimson Dynamo. She is considered by her Russian masters to be one of the best Crimson Dynamo pilots ever, and was a graduate of their \\"Federal Dynamo\\" program.Darkstar & The Winter Guard #1 As Dynamo, Galina battled the Presence, the Dire Wraiths, Warlord Krang, Iron Man, and the Remont Six. Darkstar & The Winter Guard #2-3 Galina was apparently recruited by Mandarin and Zeke Stane to join Iron Man's other villains in a plot to take down Iron Man. Mandarin and Zeke Stane gave Galina a new Crimson Dynamo armor.Invincible Iron Man #513 Powers and abilities The Crimson Dynamo wears an armored battle-suit that serves as an exoskeleton, providing the wearer with superhuman strength and durability. The suit's outer layer was composed of a carborundum matrix alloy, and is equipped with hand-blasters that can fire high-frequency electrical bolts, small missiles contained in the back shoulder area of the battle-suit, computers and radio transmitter and receiver and boot jets that allow flight. Subsequent versions of the battle- suit have featured upgrades of various kinds, by the Gremlin and other Russian scientists. As Crimson Dynamo, Valentin Shatalov's version of the armor was equipped with a powerful chest-mounted fusion-caster weapon. Other versions =Heroes Reborn= In the Heroes Reborn universe, created by Franklin Richards, Anton Vanko/Crimson Dynamo appeared as a member of Loki's Masters of Evil.Iron Man vol. 2, #10 He was first seen teamed with the Titanium Man as a defender of Russia. When Iron Man and Rebel O'Reilly traveled over Russian airspace to get to Hydra's headquarters, the two briefly battled both the Dynamo and Titanium Man. Iron Man would easily defeat them in combat with the superior technology within his Prometheum Armor. Later, the Crimson Dynamo and Titanium Man would be hired by the Black Knight to join the Masters of Evil. He is later killed by Doombots. =Marvel Zombies= The Crimson Dynamo was killed and devoured by his zombified enemy, Iron Man, in Marvel Zombies 2. =Civil War: House of M= In the House of M, the Yuri Petrovich version of the Crimson Dynamo was a member of the Soviet Super- Soldiers.Civil War: House of M #2 =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Marvel universe, there are two versions of the Crimson Dynamo. The Ultimates featured Alex Su as a Chinese Dynamo as a member of The Liberators. Based on similar technology to Iron Man's armor, he is unable to exit his armor, having been fused inside, but can supposedly use his armor to control up to 50 giant-sized drone versions (which are revealed to be piloted independently). He is apparently killed when Iron Man vaporizes him while piloting the massive Iron Man Six aircraft.Ultimates 2 #6-13 Major Valentin Shatalov appears in Ultimate Fantastic Four #47. He is based in a shack in Siberia, and has apparently been out of contact with his superiors for a long time, becoming entirely self- sufficient. When he is given the order to activate his armor he has forgotten correct procedure, and his contact was not even sure he was still alive. Reed Richards reports that this Crimson Dynamo is an \\"Eastern Bloc version of Iron Man\\", making the latest Ultimate version extremely similar to the original character. He has joined forces with the Fantastic Four to defeat the Red Ghost.Ultimate Fantastic Four #47 In other media =Television= * The Anton Vanko version of Crimson Dynamo appeared in the Iron Man portion of The Marvel Super Heroes, voiced by Tom Harvey.The Marvel Super Heroes on TV!

He was orphaned at age 6 when his father's ship was lost at sea; his mother had died when he was an infant. Cared for by his neighbors, he then moved with his guardians to Jefferson County, New York. Career Taylor moved to Ohio, where he taught school, studied medicine, and served in the local militia. He served as president of the Dane County Agricultural Society and the State Agricultural Society after he moved, in 1848, to a farm in Cottage Grove, Wisconsin. There he was involved with lumbering as well as farming. He was a member of both the Wisconsin State Assembly, in 1855, and the Wisconsin State Senate, in 1859 and 1860. He was chairman of the city and served as a member of the Dane County Board, County Superintendent of Schools, and County Superintendent of the Poor. He was trustee of the State Hospital for the Insane in Mendota from 1860 to 1874. Although he was a Democrat, he supported the North during the American Civil War and was elected to one term as Wisconsin's governor at the head of the \\"Reform\\" or \\"People's Reform\\" Party, a short-lived coalition of Democrats, reform and Liberal Republicans, and Grangers. He served as governor from January 5, 1874, to January 3, 1876, paying for his own inauguration and refusing free railroad passes and telegrams. =Governorship= During his time as Governor, Taylor had the privilege of appointing the 3rd Chief Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Edward George Ryan. The most noteworthy act of Taylor's governorship, however, was likely the so-called \\"Potter Law,\\"--named for Republican state senator Robert L. D. Potter--officially, 1874 Wisconsin Act 273. The law was a major priority of the Granger movement and effectively put railroad and freight prices under the control of a new state Railroad Commission. The law was aggressively challenged in the courts by the railroad companies, with cases even reaching the Supreme Court of the United States. The law survived legal challenge, however, Governor Taylor was defeated for re-election in 1875. His successor, Harrison Ludington, signed a bill to repeal the Potter Law and replace it with a weaker law establishing a weaker regulatory body. Death Impoverished, Taylor died in the Gisholt Home for the Aged in Burke, Wisconsin, on March 17, 1909 (age 88 years, 250 days). He is interred at Forest Hill Cemetery, Madison, Wisconsin. Taylor County, Wisconsin, is named for him. Family life Son of Robert and Mary (Coleman) Taylor, he was orphaned at age six when his father was lost at sea, and was cared for by neighbors. He married Catherine Hurd in 1842 and they had three children; and he married Viola Lee in 1886 and they had one son.

The Society argued that displays of goods were an \\"offer\\" and when a shopper selected and put the drugs into their shopping basket, that was an \\"acceptance\\", the point when the \\"sale is effected\\"; as no pharmacist had supervised the transaction at this point, Boots was in breach of the Act. Boots argued that the sale was effected only at the tills. Judgment Both the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court and the Court of Appeal sided with Boots. They held that the display of goods was not an offer. Rather, by placing the goods into the basket, it was the customer that made the offer to buy the goods. This offer could be either accepted or rejected by the pharmacist at the cash desk. The moment of the completion of contract was at the cash desk, in the presence of the supervising pharmacist. Therefore, there was no violation of the Act. Somervell LJ said, Birkett LJ followed on by saying, Subsequent legal developments This case upheld the legal concept of invitation to treat. The concept continues to apply in many situations, for example for things outside a goods' seller's control (such as a customer switching price tags or product recall) and where it would be illegal to carry out the transaction without supervision such as potentially dangerous goods. Many jurisdictions have since enacted legislation in consumer protection or fair trading that make advertisements/store price tickets with a product in stock a legally binding offer and/or a trading standards offence for the retailer to refuse to carry out the advertised transaction (bait advertising or misleading/deceptive conduct).

It tells the story of an unnamed British island that is experiencing a bizarre and stifling heatwave. Plot summary The main characters are a former novelist named Richard Callum and his wife Frankie, who own a pub called the White Lion. Richard has hired a secretary to help out on his new book, Patricia Wells, who turns out to have an obsession for Callum. A visiting scientist named Harsen reveals, ultimately, that the reason for the extreme heat is that an alien race of spiders are \\"beaming in\\" scouts from their home planet via a radio wave ray, which generates intense amounts of heat as a side effect. The spiders themselves are carnivorous and eat humans, and give off bodily heat intense enough to burn alive any person who gets too close to them. Together with Harsen, Patricia, and science fiction author Vernon Stone, the Callums try to make it to the island's radio station to call for help so that they can thwart the invasion. Screen adaptations A television adaptation was broadcast by ITV in the Play of the Week series on 14 June 1960, scripted by Giles Cooper, and directed by Cyril Coke. It starred Lee Montague as Richard Callum, Sally Bazely as Frankie Callum, Melissa Stribling as Patricia Wells, Karel Štěpánek as Doctor Harsen, and Bernard Archard as Sir James Murray. Bernard Cribbins also featured in a small role. Made by Associated Rediffusion, it no longer exists. The novel was later adapted into a 1967 film, Night of the Big Heat (also known as Island of the Burning Damned) by Planet Film Productions, starring Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Patrick Allen, Sarah Lawson, Jane Merrow, and Kenneth Cope.

The process includes selecting appropriate values for timing which is implemented in specialized traffic signal controllers. Signal timing involves deciding how much green time the traffic signal provides to an intersection by movement or approach (depending on the lane configuration), how long the pedestrian WALK signal should be, whether trains or buses should be prioritized, and numerous other factors. Basic signal timing operation Traffic signal control box, Dearborn, Michigan To understand basic signal timing fundamentals, one must also understand the different modes of operation of the signal controller which controls the signal. Traffic signals may be placed into two broad groups by their method of operation. They can be either pre-timed or actuated. Pre-timed signals provide each intersection approach a fixed amount of time on a predetermined basis, serving each approach consecutively, and repeating the pattern. In the normal operation, no movements are skipped. An actuated traffic signal relies on some mechanism for detecting vehicles as they approach the intersection. Where detection has occurred, green time is provided to that approach. Approaches with no detection are skipped. These two schemes are also referred to as interval based and phase based signal timing. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) has defined a standard scheme by which each intersection movement may be serviced without allowing conflicting movements to enter the intersection simultaneously. This scheme is commonly referred to as the NEMA Phasing Diagram. One of the most frequently used method of detection is induction loops. Other methods include magnetometers, video, infrared, radar and microwave detection. A typical loop detector installation could be approximately six foot square or six feet wide by thirty feet long. Other shapes may also be used including circular and hexagonal loops. These are cut into, or buried below the surface of the roadway. The preferred wire is stranded copper with an insulating cover which is then loosely surrounded by a protection jacket. Electrically this is a 'flat' coil in the pavement structure that detects vehicles by changes in the magnetic inductance field of the coil when ferrous metal from a vehicle passes through the field. The electronic sensor in the controller cabinet senses the change in the magnetic field. The output from the sensor electronics is a 'switch' closure. This can be an electro-mechincial relay or solid-state. The 'switch' is normally closed (NC) in the de-engerized state but held open when power is applied to the circuit. This is called 'Fail-Call' so that if there is a failure in the sensor electronics the output will place a 'Call' to the controller as if a vehicle is present on the loop detector. Video (both normal and infrared) use a change in contrast of the image detection zone to detect traffic. All detection methods except inductive loop detectors and magnetometers suffer in accuracy as the result of the concept of occlusion. This limits the cameras view in certain instances. There are different categories of actuated signals. To save money on maintenance, some agencies opt to design an intersection as semi-actuated. Semi-actuated means the intersection has detection on the minor street approaches and major street left turns only. The whole intersection is then programmed to operate a fixed time every cycle, but the controller will service the other movements only when there is a 'call' or demand. An arterial series of signals that are operating in a semi-actuated or fixed mode and importantly operating with the same cycle length can be made to function in a coordinated manner. During signal coordination, most signal systems typically are designed to operate in a semi-actuated mode. In fixed operation, a controller has a set programmed time to service all movements every cycle. The controller will service all movements whether or not there is vehicle demand. When a detector at an actuated signal breaks, that movement will then have to operate as fixed until the detector is repaired. There are three general ways for a signal to operate, FREE, COORD, and FLASH operation. In FREE operation, the signal is running based on its own demand and timing parameters based on the information provided by its detectors. It is not operating under any background cycle length. In COORD operation, short for coordination, the signal is running a background cycle length. Non-major street movements are usually still actuated, and the controller will rest on the major street until the background cycle length is fulfilled. The final mode is FLASH operation in which all vehicle signal heads continuously display a flashing red, or the main street shows flashing yellow while others show flashing red. Pedestrian heads are dark. When the volume of vehicles at an intersection no longer warrants the signal to be active, the signal can switch to FLASH mode. When volume picks up again the signal switches back into either FREE or COORD operation. For example, the daily operation of a signal may involve it being in FLASH mode early in the morning, COORD during the day, FREE in the evening, and back to FLASH late at night. Basic timing functions There are several basic timing functions that need to be programmed for the traffic controller to operate. MIN time determines the minimum duration of the green interval for each movement. Left turns, minor streets, major streets, usually have different MIN times. Left turns and minor side street intervals are often in the range from 4 to 10 seconds while major streets often go higher than 15. Gap, extension, or passage time determines the extendable portion of the green time for a movement. The movement remains in the extendable portion as long as an actuation is present and the passage timer has not expired. If the interval is set as three seconds and there is not vehicle present after that three seconds, the movement will terminate. MAX time limits of a maximum time of the green interval. If there are no conflicting demands on the intersection, the controller will ignore the MAX and rest in the major street movement. Yellow Clearance determines the yellow time for the associated movement. Red Clearance determines the all-red time for the associated movement. Walk time provides the length of the walk indication. Flashing Don't Walk is the duration of the flashing pedestrian clearance. This is timed as the length of the crosswalk divided by a speed of 3.5 feet per second, minus the yellow clearance for the adjacent vehicle movement. Cycle Length controls the time from one major street yellow to the next major street yellow for purposes of coordination. It is often set by the master controller for the particular plan used. This is also used if the signal has no detectors attached. Offset controls the timing of the start of the major street green and/or the end of the major street green, to keep the signal in coordination with other signals in the overall timing plan. This timing can be set by the master controller for the particular plan used. Coordination Coordination (the more correct term is progression) refers to the timing of the signals so that a \\"platoon\\" of cars traveling on a street arrives at a succession of green lights and proceeds through multiple intersections without stopping. A well coordinated signal system can enhance traffic flow, reduce delay and minimize pollution. However, it is not always possible to retain progression throughout a network of signals. It is also difficult to maintain signal progression on a two-way street. An early traffic engineer Henry Barnes, who served as Commissioner of Traffic in many cities including Baltimore, Maryland and New York City, developed coordinated traffic signal timings, so that large amounts of traffic could be accommodated on major traffic arterials. Traffic signal timing is a very complex topic. For example timing a 'WALK' signal for a wide pedestrian crossing and slower pedestrians (for example the elderly) could result in very long waits for vehicles, and thus increases the likelihood of cars running the light, which could potentially cause accidents. Therefore, optimizing the safety of intersections involves multiple factors like street width, lane width, number of intersecting streets, availability of electricity for a signal, number of cars per unit of time and even/uneven nature of flow, number and type of pedestrians, and many other factors. Traffic signals can be programmed to have different signal timing plans, depending on the time of day. Some signal control systems adapt signal timings depending on measured traffic conditions. Research Standardizing signal timing procedures, standards, and best practices has been completed in the form of the Signal Timing Manual, sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration. The Signal Timing Manual is a tabletop resource compiled by Kittelson & Associates, Inc., the Texas Transportation Institute, the Institute of Transportation Engineers, and the University of Maryland.

The station airs a country music radio format. The studios and offices are located on East Van Buren Street in Phoenix near Sky Harbor Airport.KNIXcountry.iheart.com/contact The transmitter is in South Mountain Park, off Road B, amid other towers for Phoenix-area FM and TV stations.Radio-Locator.com/KNIX-FM History =Early Years= The station originally signed on the air on December 25, 1961.Broadcasting Yearbook 1963 page B-10 Because there was no associated AM station, the call sign was simply KNIX. It has kept the call letters KNIX or KNIX-FM throughout its history. KNIX was powered at only 3,100 watts, a fraction of its current output, only heard in Phoenix and its adjacent suburbs. KNIX aired a beautiful music format. The license was held by Aztec Radio, Inc., with owners John and Donna Karshner also serving as on-air staff and programmers. Their son, John P. Karshner II, became one of the youngest DJs in America at age 16. =Buck Owens Ownership= In May 1968, country singer Buck Owens bought KNIX.Broadcasting Yearbook 1969 page B-10 The purchase documents used his formal name, Alvis Edgar Owens, Jr. In addition to KNIX, Owens acquired KYND AM 1580 in Tempe from a different owner. The year before, Owens had purchased an AM and FM station in Bakersfield, California, KUZZ-AM-FM, which had been a profitable move. Under Owens' ownership, the AM station in Phoenix became country music KTUF 1580, while 102.5 KNIX changed to progressive rock in August 1968. In early March 1969, KNIX-FM switched to country and the power was dramatically boosted to 100,000 watts. KTUF and KNIX-FM began simulcasting the country format, allowing listeners with FM radios to hear it in stereo, while the AM signal could be received on all other radios. Station bumper stickers proclaimed \\"K-TUF/KNIX, We Stamped Out 3-Letter Radio.\\" The bumper sticker referred to KOY AM 550, the leading radio station in Phoenix at the time, and the only one with a three-letter call sign. In 1973, the AM call letters switched to KNIX, while the FM station added the -FM suffix, creating KNIX-AM-FM. The AM station began programming classic country music, becoming the flagship station for a network called \\"Real Country.\\" Meanwhile, KNIX-FM concentrated on contemporary and recent country hits. AM 1580 KNIX ended its association with the Real Country Network in 1985 and the AM-FM simulcast was restored. KNIX-FM not only led the Phoenix radio market, but was considered one of the premier country radio stations in the United States. Under the leadership of Buck Owens' son, General Manager Michael Owens, and Programming/Operations Manager Larry Daniels, KNIX-FM was consistently number one in Phoenix. It topped the market in all but one ratings period between 1980 and 1990. =Clear Channel Acquisition= In 1998 Clear Channel Communications acquired the FM station from Owens, while the AM station was sold to The Walt Disney Company. KNIX-FM was sold for $84 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-23 The Disney Company used the AM station for its Radio Disney children's radio format, while KNIX-FM kept its successful country format. On September 16, 2014, Clear Channel renamed itself iHeartMedia, Inc., to bring its corporate name in line with its iHeartRadio internet platform. Awards KNIX-FM has won many prestigious awards in the country music and radio industry. They include honors from the Country Music Association, the Academy of Country Music, Billboard magazine, and the Marconi Award for excellence in broadcasting. The CMA honored KNIX-FM as its \\"Major Market Station of the Year\\" in 2019, its sixth time receiving the award. HD Radio KNIX-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format. The main signal is a simulcast of KNIX's country programming. On April 25, 2006, Clear Channel announced that KNIX's HD2 subchannel would carry a format focusing on music from new and up-and-coming Country artists. Several years later, the HD2 subchannel began carrying the audio of co-owned talk radio station KFYI 550 AM. The third channel carries iHeartMedia's Total Traffic Network (TTN), a data only service broadcasting real-time traffic streaming to GPS devices with HD Radio receivers, providing accident, traffic flow, and road construction information. Devices capable of receiving traffic data are available from manufactures such as Garmin and Cydle. Former staff *Charlie Ochs (mornings) *W. Steven Martin (mornings) *J.D.

He first appeared in Generation X #1, and was created by Scott Lobdell and Chris Bachalo. Emplate would serve as one of the major antagonists to the Generation X comic book series during its run. Publishing history The character first appeared in Generation X #1 (Nov 1994). Fictional character biography Emplate was born Marius St. Croix, the brother of Generation X's M (Monet) and the M-Twins (Nicole & Claudette). When his mutant powers first manifested, his sisters were disgusted, especially Monet. In retaliation, Marius somehow turned Monet into the mute and diamond-skinned Penance. With their sister missing, Nicole and Claudette turned to Marius for answers, blaming him for her supposed death. They opened a dimensional portal to imprison Marius; afterwards, he called after Penance to join him, saying that only he could cure her. She followed after him and became his slave and \\"dinner\\" until the events of Generation X #1. The twins panicked and decided that they would pose as their missing sister so that their parents would not be angry (as they thought that Monet was their favorite child). It was in these roles that the characters would be introduced to readers. =Encounters with Generation X= In this other dimension, Marius was under extreme torture by some unknown beings, and traversing between dimensions was characterized as a thousand hands ripping at his flesh. Due to this torture, Marius had to acquire a respirator to aid in his breathing.Generation X #12 Still he had to feed, and, fueled on by the marrow of the captive Penance, Emplate would periodically travel to our plane of reality. In one of these trips he encountered Chamber and tried to feed off of his powerful energy signature, but Generation X arrived in time to save him. When they returned to the Massachusetts Academy, the team found Penance passed out on their lawn. She had been shuttled by the enigmatic Aboriginal mutant Gateway, whose only word to the confused team was \\"Penance\\".Generation X #1 Emplate later assembled a team to torment Generation X that included Murmur, Bulwark, Vincente, and his usual underling D.O.A.. In an uncharacteristic move, Emplate also recruited a human: Gayle Edgerton, Chamber's ex-girlfriend who Chamber had unintentionally paralyzed when his powers first manifested. Emplate offered her a chance for revenge, turning her into one of his vampiric minions. They were successful in capturing the young mutants, but with the help of Bishop and Penance switching sides they were successful in stopping the team. During the confrontation, Emplate revealed that Monet was his sister, causing Generation X to grow wary of her. Though Emplate was defeated, he still transformed Synch into one of his minions, and transported Synch to his home of St. Louis to attack his family and friends. The girls of Generation X followed him, and with their help Synch was able to remember his humanity and fight the hunger within him, releasing him from Emplate's thrall.Generation X #12-16 =M-Plate= Changing the roster a bit, Emplate plotted to harm the team again, this time working with Chimera and her minions.Generation X #33 His timing was very inopportune, as Monet had been knocked unconscious and had split back into the twins.Generation X #31 They awoke from their comas to see their brother standing over them, and, recognizing that he was in pain, attempted to help him. The twins rejoined into their M form and then grabbed a hold of their brother and joined with him also, forming an amalgamated being calling itself M-Plate. This form had aspects of both forms, but also displayed new powers and new malevolent plans.Generation X #34-35 M-Plate traveled to a place on the edge of Time called the Citadel of the Universal Amalgamator, which was a weapon of vast power that could merge every individual consciousness into a giant \\"godhead\\". Wishing to control every conscious being, M-Plate set to use the weapon, but failed in her/his attempts. The being was split apart when the mutant rat Dirtnap swallowed her/him and began to digest him/her. The digestion process forced the three beings to separate and attempt to escape (individually and in pairs). The stress of the escape attempt caused Dirtnap to explode but also restored the twins and Emplate to their separate forms. Emplate was quickly dispatched by Banshee.Generation X #36-39 =Emplate's Hellions= Monet, Cartier, and Marius taken from Generation X #58 written by Jay Farber and Darrick Robertson Emplate once again tried to capture Penance, this time with a new group of \\"Hellions\\". Their ranks consisted of Wrap another mummified mutant whose body was made of raw energy which increased his strength, Vincente who now had the ability to change the chemical composition of his vaporous form, a female named Nocturne who could release psionic bolts of energy which disrupt the central nervous system of her targets or destabilize molecular bonds in inorganic materials, and the ubiquitous D.O.A. Despite their new roster, their attempts failed. In the process, Emplate and his minions battled Generation X. Jubilee blew up Proudstar Hall which caused the M-Twins to be knocked free from the Penance body, and Emplate to be knocked unconscious. =Beyond M-Day= Since the events of M-Day, where the Scarlet Witch depowered 90% of the mutant population, Emplate has retained his powers. Emplate reappears on the former site of the Xavier Institute, where he kills a few construction workers currently working on the site. He later reappears on Utopia and after watching Madison Jeffries and Danger, he attacks them; after taking out Danger, he manages to sample Jeffries. The X-Men arrive and after defeating them he fades back to his reality. There he reveals to D.O.A. that Penance is no longer with them but from the information he gathered from Jeffries, he sets his sights on Bling.X-Men: Legacy Annual #1 (2009) Emplate captures Bling! and brings her to his dimension. After a brief struggle with Bling!, Emplate proceeds to feed upon her, causing her to pass out. After talking to D.O.A. and feeling his tormentors approaching, Emplate prepares to feed again so he may survive his next encounter with them. He enters Bling!'s prison and after Bling! manages to get a bit of his backstory, he feeds on her again and goes to his tormentors telling them to feast and be damned.X-Men: Legacy #228 When Rogue comes after Emplate trying to rescue Bling!, D.O.A. sends some vicious creatures to attack and kill her. He informs Emplate of Rogue's rescue attempt and he decides to kill Bling! in case the X-Men are tracking him through her. Rogue escapes the creatures and teams up with Bling! in a surprise attack on him when he tries to feed on her one last time.X-Men: Legacy #229 During the fight, Rogue and Emplate absorb each other's powers and continue to fight until Rogue returns to her body. Emplate's house is brought to the X-Men's Utopia where, thanks to the X-Club, he becomes trapped. He attempts a final time to kill Bling! but Bling!, together with Rogue, knock him out and send him back to his dimension. In the last panel he is shown to be surrounded by giant beasts in the Glass Moon and his eventual fate remains unknown.X-Men: Legacy #230 Emplate as since been revealed to have survived the giant beast and was also able to escape from his dimension, since he has been targeting the Morlocks who live beneath New York City.Uncanny X-Men (Vol 4) #7 =Dawn of X= Emplate was eventually welcomed to the new mutant island of Krakoa, created by Xavier, Magneto and Moira. He entered through the teleportation gateway alongside other villainous and fractious mutants, who had been invited to join the nation in order to heal mutantdom and start over as a whole species together.House of X #5 Marius alongside Selene were later tasked by Xavier with measuring the amount of psychic energy that Krakoa would take from its inhabitants. A similar protocol was put in place for them too as both also need to nourish on mutants for survival.X-Men (Vol. 5) #3 Powers and abilities In order to remain on this physical plane, Emplate must suck on the bone marrow of other mutants. He does so with the aid of vampiric mouths in the palms of his hands. Once he has sampled a mutant's marrow, he can temporarily duplicate their powers. While in this plane of existence, he can remain unsynched with our reality so as to be invisible. He can also see a mutant's \\"aura\\" and tell various things about him or her by that. If he is unable to receive enough marrow, he is thrown into a pocket dimension where he is tortured (it is due to this torture that Emplate cannot survive without the use of his respirator). Like true vampires, he can somehow turn others into \\"Emplates\\" like himself. Another natural power he does have, is his ability to control his own density, from being intangible to invulnerable. Notes * In Bishop's future, a shadowy group called the Emplates preyed on mutants, infecting and assimilating their victims into their ranks. Like Emplate, they also had clawed mouths in their hands.X-Men: The Times and Life of Lucas Bishop #2 Since Emplate can \\"infect\\" others with his vampire-like powers, it makes sense that he would be the progenitor of the group from Bishop's timeline. * Emplate had a group of lackeys that were not named in the comic book series. For advertising purposes, they were called the Hellions, but this name was never used by either Emplate or his followers. Other versions =Age of Apocalypse= In the Age of Apocalypse, Emplate was a member of Sinister's Elite Mutant Force, alongside his sisters, the Monet Twins who were under Emplate's control. He was killed by Cyclops' father, Christopher Summers.Tales of the Age of Apocalypse He is later restored by Dark Beast and Sugar Man, under the orders of Weapon Omega.Age of Apocalypse #3 References External links * Emplate at Uncannyxmen.net Characters created by Scott Lobdell Characters created by Chris Bachalo Comics characters introduced in 1994 Marvel Comics supervillains Fictional murderers Marvel Comics mutants Fictional characters who can turn invisible Fictional vampires ","title":"Emplate"},{"id":"2829060","text":"Ong Hok Ham (1 May 1933 – 30 August 2007) was an eminent Chinese Indonesian historian considered one of the leading experts on Indonesian history during the 19th century Dutch colonial rule. His particular area of knowledge centered on events in Java during the period, and he authored a number of works dealing with the subject. A native of Surabaya, East Java which, until the founding of Indonesia in 1945, was a part of the Dutch East Indies, Ong Hok Ham lived in the city of his birth for the first twenty-five years of his life. Ong's family was upper-middle class, but through his maternal grandmother, Han Loen Nio, Ong hailed from the patrician Han family of Lasem, part of the baba bangsawan or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia, and from a long line of Chinese officers who served in the civil bureaucracy in the Dutch East Indies. Ong could, thus, trace his lineage in Java back, through Han Bwee Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen (1727 – 1778), to Han Siong Kong (1673 – 1743), a Chinese-born migrant of ancient lineage. Like others from old Peranakan Chinese families, Ong grew up between Chinese, Javanese and Dutch cultures. In 1958, Ong moved to Bandung, West Java, where he received his schooling and began his writing career. Seventeen years later, in 1975, he received his Ph.D in History from Yale University with the dissertation The Residency of Madiun: Priyayi and Peasant in the Nineteenth Century. He was a regular contributor to the Indonesian magazine Tempo and a collection of his pieces for the magazine written between 1976 and 2001, Wahyu yang Hilang, Negeri yang Guncang (A Lost Mandate, an Agitated Country) was published in 2002. He wrote a series of other books, mostly a collection of essays and articles, including Runtuhnya Hindia Belanda (The Fall of the Netherlands Indies), Negara dan Rakyat (The State and the People), and Dari Soal Priayi sampai Nyi Blorong—Refleksi Historis Nusantara (From Priayi to Nyi Blorong—Historical Reflections on the Indonesian Archipelago). An English- language collection of his writings, The Thugs, the Curtain Thief, and the Sugar Lord, received publication in 2003. The book chronicled power, politics and culture in colonial Java. In 1989, he retired from his duties as professor of history at the University of Indonesia. His final responsibility was as chairman of the Lembaga Studi Sejarah Indonesia (the Indonesian Institute of Historical Studies).

It covers themes of dark horror, fantasy and science fiction and surrealism in its literary scope and reviews and discusses music in the gothic, punk, heavy metal, electronica and similar darker genres. It also includes book reviews, DVD reviews and issues related to the goth and punk subcultures. The magazine has released over 150 issues and ran for 15 years, with the full text of all articles available at their online website in full. Legends tries to stick to a monthly publishing schedule as much as it can. History Legends magazine began in October, 1990 under the direction of Marcus Pan who continues as editor-in-chief. Originally started as a self- serving fanzine that covered science fiction, fantasy and gaming, it was intended to be a short lived project of three issues in length. It nonetheless continued and evolved, adding more work from other writers and artists as time drew on. Around 1996 the Legends Online site was born on the World Wide Web and eventually the text of all articles and scans of all imaging was available online. The magazine added such notable writers as Dan Century, Cameron Rodgers, Logan Russell and Sue Simpson to its staff who later went on to writing careers of their own. The musical aspect started to find its way into more mainstream sections of Legends a couple years after the website version went up. At this time Legends struggled to embody a music magazine format while not losing its literary side, an act that may be a failure or a success depending on whom you ask. The music aspect continued to grow as interviews with such artists as Alien Sex Fiend, Distorted Reality, Nashville Pussy and Dave Smalley, to name only a few, brought more widespread readers to the magazine. Literature and fiction is still embodied in the magazine, though months can go by before a fictional feature comes up, but music has taken hold as a major aspect of the magazine's continuing format. In addition to these main ideas, Legends also features the 'Off the Shelf' book review column, DVD and movie reviews, 'Horrorscopes' by Auntie PanPan and, until recently, political columnist and satirist the Mean Little Man. The professionalism of the magazine itself began to change in mid-2003 when editor Marcus Pan partnered with Mean Little Man productions. Mean Little Man Productions Unused ticket stub to the Legends Magazine 150th issue party at Club Rare, Manhattan.In mid-2003 Legends Magazine's editor Marcus Pan partnered with Mean Little Man Productions in an attempt to further Legends Magazine's reach and potential. Marcus would continue to handle the creative and writing direction of the magazine while MLM would further the marketing and promotions of same. As time wore on for a couple years it became apparent that the two parties were incompatible when it came to working together on a business scale, with MLM arguing that the direction of the magazine wasn't being taken seriously enough while Marcus argued that the direction of the magazine was fine and fulfills the goals that he had in mind since inception - promoting music, writing himself and providing a forum for new fiction writers and essayists. The partnership was almost immediately dissolved following the 150th issue party. The partnership however began a new era for Legends Magazine as the work done by MLM provided new features to the periodical. The website was redesigned and is still in use today and the hardcopy edition of the magazine itself took on a much more professional look and feel with the same layout also still in use. While the MLM and Marcus Pan partnership may have dissolved, it did bring plenty of good things to the table that the magazine continues to use and build on. Legends 150th Issue Party Legends Magazine held a party surrounding their 150th issue release on June 25, 2005 at Club Rare in New York City's Manhattan district. The party featured live music by Bitter Grace, Bunker Soldier, State of Being, Amber Spyglass and Christopher Eissing, all bands except Bitter Grace having come from different states. It also featured DJ CSB running the turntables in between music and handling the stage. Ticket sales for the event were dismally low and the magazine nearly folded after having to cover the bar guarantee that was agreed to with the club. While the party went well, it was under-attended causing havoc in the Legends Magazine ranks. The party itself was featured on Manhattan television on a show called the Vampyre Lounge and the publicity was done well, but few came out to see the results. Following the party Legends foundered for a few months before finally returning with the 151st issue months later in September, 2005. The party, however, resulted in the splitting of Mean Little Man Productions and editor Marcus Pan's partnership as a falling out occurred during the course of the evening. Continuing On While the dissolving of the most prominent partnership in Legends Magazine's history was a heavy blow to the periodical at the time, Legends Magazine stumbled on now back under the sole direction of editor Marcus Pan. The arrival of Legends #151 proved its continuation in September, 2005 while two months was spent in hiatus to recover from the dissolving. Writers such as JHR, Sue Simpson, Jeff Franzmann, ACyD Burn and Kim Mercil, among others, continue to provide content to the issue and while expenses for the magazine were scaled back as much as possible (bands and labels receiving tear sheets of their reviews rather than a full copy of the issue) for the time being it continues to print. Currently Legends Online, the web version and companion site to the hardcopy edition, continues strongly receiving as many as 20,000 hits a day and as many as 50,000 readers per month. The full text and electronic versions of all issues are still available and once again become available immediately (during the Mean Little Man partnership online versions were delayed a month for marketing reasons). October, 2005 marks Legends Magazine's 15th anniversary.

He is the son of Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, an Indonesian economist, and Dora Sigar. He is the former husband of Titiek Suharto, the late President Suharto's second daughter. They were married in 1983 and divorced in 1998 during the Indonesian political crisis. Prabowo graduated from the Indonesian Military Academy in 1970 and served in the Special Forces (Kopassus) until his appointment as chief of the Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad) in 1998. That same year, he was dishonorably discharged from the military and subsequently banned from entering the United States because of alleged human rights violations. In early 2008, Prabowo's inner circle, including Fadli Zon, established the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra). In the 2009 presidential election, he ran unsuccessfully for the vice-presidency as Megawati Sukarnoputri's running mate. He contested the 2014 presidential election and was defeated by Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo, which he initially disputed. He made another unsuccessful run for the presidency in 2019 with Sandiaga Uno as his running mate and with the support of Gerindra, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), the National Mandate Party (PAN), the Democratic Party and Berkarya Party. His refusal to accept the result saw his followers stage protests that sparked deadly riots in Jakarta. Family background Prabowo, 12 years old (standing right), with his siblings and grandparents, Margono Djojohadikusumo and Siti Katoemi Wirodihardjo Prabowo's father, Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, was an economist who served as former President Suharto's minister for the economy and minister for research and technology.Ready Susanto, Mari mengenal kabinet Indonesia [Let's know the cabinet of Indonesia], Lazuardi Buku Utama, Jakarta, 2011. Sumitro named Prabowo after his own younger brother, a martyr hero who died in a battle against the Japanese in Lengkong, Tangerang during the Indonesian National Revolution.Friend (2003), p. 323 Prabowo's mother, Dora Maria Sigar, was a Protestant Christian of Minahasan descent, who originated from the Maengkom family in Langowan, North Sulawesi. Prabowo has two older sisters, Bintianingsih and Mayrani Ekowati, and one younger brother, Hashim Djojohadikusumo. Hashim's pribumi conglomerate business interests stretch from Indonesia to Canada and Russia. Between 1966 and 1968, the family lived in London, where Prabowo attended and graduated from The American School in London.The American School in London – 1968: Gateway, p. 32 [yearbook] Sumitro subsequently encouraged his son to attend military academy. One of Prabowo's role models was Turkish military figure Atatürk, and according to peers and observers, Prabowo was talented with a passion for stratagems and had an appetite for political power. Prabowo's grandfather, Margono Djojohadikusumo, was the founder of Bank Negara Indonesia, the first leader of Indonesia's Provisional Advisory Council (Dewan Pertimbangan Agung Sementara), and Committee for Preparatory Work for Indonesian Independence (Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia).Djojohadikusumo, Margono (2000).

Kopassus: Inside Indonesia's Special Forces. Equinox Publishing He graduated in 1974 with others who would gain senior leadership positions such as Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. In 1976, Prabowo served in the Indonesian National Army Special Force Kopassus and was assigned as the commander of Group 1 Komando Pasukan Sandhi Yudha (Kopassandha), which was one of the Indonesian Army's Nanggala commando units in East Timor, the former Portuguese territory that Indonesia had invaded the previous year. Prabowo, then 26 years old, was the youngest Nanggala commander. Prabowo led the mission to capture the vice president of Fretilin, who was the first Prime Minister of East Timor, Nicolau dos Reis Lobato. Guiding Prabowo was Antonio Lobato – Nicolau's younger brother. On 31 December 1978, Prabowo's company found and fatally shot Nicolau in the stomach as he was being escorted in Maubisse, fifty kilometres south of Dili. In 1985 Prabowo attended the Advanced Infantry Officers Course at Fort Benning, in the United States for commando training. In the early 1990s, as the commander of Kopassus Group 3, the now Major General Prabowo attempted to crush the East Timorese independence movement by using irregular troops (hooded \\"ninja\\" gangs dressed in black and operating at night) and, in main towns and villages, militias trained and directed by Kopassus commanders. Human rights abuses rose. The Army's 1997 campaign was called Operation Eradicate.John G. Taylor, East Timor: The Price of Freedom (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999; 1st ed., 1991), p. xv. (in Friend (2003), p. 433.) In 1996, Prabowo led the Mapenduma Operation in the mountainous terrain of Papua, Indonesia. The goal of the operation was the release of 11 scientific researchers, who had been taken hostage by the Free Papua Movement (OPM). The researchers were five Indonesians, four Britons, one Dutchman and his pregnant German wife. Two of the Indonesian male hostages were killed shortly before the rescue operation. The mission involved covert support from British Military Attache and SAS veteran Colonel Ivor Helberg. Following the hostage transfer, Kopassus under Prabowo began a reprisal campaign against villages perceived to support OPM, in one incident at Geselema village attacking the villagers with a military helicopter disguised as a Red Cross helicopter. On 20 March 1998, Prabowo was appointed head of the 27,000-strong Army Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad), that Suharto had commanded in 1965.Friend (2003), p. 325 Role in 1998 riots and the Fall of Suharto Less than three months after his appointment as head of Kostrad, on the first day of the May 1998 riots, Prabowo urged the commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces, Wiranto, to let him bring his Strategic Reserve units from outside Jakarta into the city to help restore order.Friend (2005), p. 330 Hundreds of men trained by Kopassus (Prabowo's former command) were flown from Dili to Yogyakarta in chartered planes, and then on to Jakarta by train.Friend (2003), p. 331 Prabowo publicly urged Indonesians to join him to fight \\"traitors to the nation\\".Friend (2003), p. 315 On the morning of 14 May, Kopassus troops escorted young thugs from Lampung in southern Sumatra into the capital.Berfield and Loveard, Ten Days, in The Last Days of President Suharto, Edward Aspinall, Herb Feith, and Gerry van Klinken, eds. (Clayton, Victoria: Monash Asia Institute, 1999), pp. 57–58. Thus Prabowo was accused of using his contacts in his former command to import and create trouble, while Wiranto had declined to give Prabowo's current command, Kostrad, permission to quell the existing trouble, in line with classic Javanese tactic to stir chaos to discredit a rival and/or seize power. Troops under Prabowo's command kidnapped and tortured at least nine democracy activists in the months before the May 1998 Riots. In one testimony, a former detainee told of being tortured for days in an unidentified location, allegedly a military camp where most of their time was spent blindfolded, while being forced to answer repeated questions, mainly concerning their political activities. Abuse included being punched, terrorized physically and mentally, and given electric shocks. Later, in 2009, two of the nine men were candidates for Gerinda, Prabowo's political party, and another served as his media adviser. Prabowo was also suspected of organizing the kidnappings of another 13 activists (who all remain \\"missing\\") between February 1997 and May 1998. Later investigations into the May riots revealed that violence in Jakarta was the result of an internal struggle within the military elite to become Suharto's successor. Many believed Prabowo, as Strategic Reserve commander, sought to become his father-in-law's successor and coveted the Commander of the Armed Forces position held by General Wiranto, who was favored to succeed Suharto. Together with Operations Commander for Greater Jakarta (', Pangkoops Jaya) Major General Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, Prabowo aimed to terrorize opponents of the government and to show that Wiranto was \\"an incompetent commander who could not control disorder\\". During the months of August and September, the fact finding team interviewed Prabowo, Sjafrie, and other military commanders regarding their movements during the Jakarta riots. Prabowo asserted that he was unsure of the precise movements of military forces in the capital and deferred to Sjafrie. In its final report, the fact finding team suspected that, on the night of 14 May, Prabowo met with several Armed Forces and prominent civilian figures at the Kostrad headquarters to discuss organization of the violence. However, this was later refuted by several people who attended the meeting, including prominent human rights lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution and Joint Fact Finding Team member Bambang Widjojanto. Further testimonies by Prabowo in the years following the investigation contradicted the team's report and led to skepticism of the team's allegations. On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation from the presidency and Vice President BJ Habibie took over as president. On the afternoon following Habibie's inauguration as president, Prabowo demanded of Habibie that he be put in charge of the army in place of Wiranto. However, Habibie and Wiranto demoted Prabowo from Kostrad commander instead, and the following day announced Wiranto's promotion to Minister of Defence and Security and to Indonesian National Armed Forces (ABRI, later renamed TNI) commander. A furious Prabowo went to the Presidential Palace packing a side arm and with trucks of his Kostrad troops. On being blocked from entering the Habibie's office, he instead went to Suharto who rebuked him.Adam Schwartz, A Nation in Waiting, pp. 367–369; Donald Emmerson, Indonesia Beyond Suharto, p. 309; Kees Van Dijk, A Country in Despair, pp. 209–210. All three from Friend (2003), p. 346Jusuf Habibie, \\"Detik-detik yang Menentukan: Jalan Panjang Indonesia Menuju Demokrasi\\" (trans. \\"Decisive Moments: Indonesia's Long Road towards Democracy\\") Prabowo was visited by Wiranto at his home over the weekend of 23–24 May and subsequently reassigned to a non-combat role at the Armed Forces Command and General Staff College in Bandung. Following an ABRI investigation, Prabowo acknowledged responsibility for the kidnapping of the activists.Friend (2003), p. 347 He was discharged from military service in August. He and Wiranto denied that the discharge was a result of disciplinary action. In August 1998, the Dewan Kehormatan Perwira (Officers Council of Honor) tried, and found Prabowo guilty of \\"misinterpreting orders\\" in the kidnapping of anti-Suharto activists in 1998. He was discharged from military services, and went into a voluntary exile in Jordan where he knew that country's new young King Abdullah as a fellow commander of special forces. In an interview with Asiaweek magazine in 2000, Prabowo said \\"I never threatened Habibie. I was not behind the riots. That is a great lie. I never betrayed Pak Harto. I never betrayed Habibie. I never betrayed my country...There was a certain group that wanted to make me a scapegoat, maybe to hide their involvement.\\"\\" Rights groups have long questioned Prabowo's eligibility to run for president, noting that he was discharged dishonourably from the Army in August 1998 for \\"misinterpreting orders\\" in the abduction of the democracy activists. While that was the military's official statement, observers have long believed that it was a coup conspiracy that saw Prabowo, then the commander of the Army Strategic Reserves, given his marching orders. As a 2014 presidential candidate, Prabowo's past came under renewed scrutiny, with many organisations calling for him to step down. A coalition, which consisted of Imparsial, Kontras, the Setara Institute, and the Human Rights Working Group (HRWG), combined under the Civil Society Coalition Against Forgetting, visited the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) in Jakarta on 7 May 2014 to urge the commission to re-investigate Prabowo. A 27 June 2014 report indicated that an investigative journalist, Allan Nairn, had been threatened with arrest \\"for revealing the former general's role in human rights abuses.\\"  Business career  After being discharged from the military, Prabowo joined his brother Hashim Djojohadikusumo's business. He purchased Kiani Kertas, a paper pulp and plantation company based in Mangkajang, East Kalimantan. Prior to Prabowo's purchase, Kiani was owned by Bob Hasan, a businessman close to former Presiden Suharto. Today, Prabowo's Nusantara Group controls 27 companies in Indonesia and abroad. Prabowo's companies include Nusantara Energy (oil and natural gas, coal), Tidar Kerinci Agung (palm oil plantations) and Jaladri Nusantara (fishery industry). Prabowo rebranded Kiani Kertas to Kertas Nusantara. The company was established in 1990 and is part of the Nusantara Energy. It controls an area of 3,400 hectares used for paper mills, employee housing, private schools, and various company facilities. Kiani has been awarded ISO 900–2005 status as one of the highest quality management companies. It is reported that Kiani Kertas has been experiencing financial difficulties and in early 2014, workers took to the streets to demand their wages which had not been paid in five months. Prabowo was the wealthiest presidential candidate in the 2009 election, with assets of Rp 1.5 trillion (about US$150 million) and US$7.5 million. In 2007, PT Ridlatama, whose majority stakeholder was British-based Churchill PLC, conducted a geo-survey eastern Kalimantan for coal. Two months after the survey yielded positive results, East Kutai officials granted mining licenses to Nusantara Energy (a subsidiary of the Nusantara Group, a conglomerate owned by Prabowo Subianto's family) to operate in the area surveyed by Ridlatama. In 2010, Ridlatama's license was revoked, effectively completing Nusantara's take over of Churchill's operations. Churchill appealed to the Supreme Court of Indonesia but lost the case. In 2012, Churchill filed a case against the government of Indonesia at the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, demanding $2 billion in compensation. Indonesia argued that ICSID had no authority to arbitrate. In 2014 ICSID ruled that it had the authority and the case is still ongoing. In 2014, the regent of East Kutai, Isran Noor, publicly endorsed Prabowo Subianto as presidential candidate. He also considered pressing criminal charges against Churchill, alleging that Churchill forged its license. NGOs Prabowo opens the 2011 Pencak Silat SEA Games tournament held in Taman Mini, Jakarta.

Hashim unsuccessfully pressured Goenawan Mohamad to sell his outspoken and banned Tempo magazine to him.Friend (2003), p. 324 As lieutenant colonel, Prabowo invited Gus Dur to his battalion headquarters in 1992 and warned him to stick to religion and to stay out of politics, or face unspecified actions if he continued to oppose the President.Friend (2003), pp. 203, 324 He later warned the intellectual Nurcholish Madjid (Cak Nur) to resign from the KIPP, the election monitoring unit set up by Goenawan Mohamad, which armed forces commander Feisal Tanjung had denounced as \\"obviously unconstitutional\\".\\"Surat Dari Redaksi\\" (Letter from the Editor), Tempo, 6–12 Oct 98, p. 7; Schwarz, Nation in Waiting, pp. 161–162, 320, 490n35. In 2004, Prabowo was one of five contenders vying to become Golkar party's presidential candidate. He received the lowest number of votes, just 39, and was eliminated in the first round. The second round of voting was won by Wiranto. In early 2008, Prabowo's inner circle, including Fadli Zon, established the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), which nominated Prabowo for presidency in the 2009 elections. However, having won 26 out of 560 seats in the Indonesian parliament, the party did not have the required numbers and Prabowo ran as vice presidential candidate to Megawati Soekarnoputri, daughter of Indonesia's first president Sukarno. The pair, referred to colloquially by the Indonesian media as Mega–Pro, earned 27% of the vote and lost to Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his running mate, economist Boediono. In November 2011, Prabowo announced his intention to run in the 2014 presidential elections. Surveys published by the Center for Policy Studies and Strategic Development (Puskaptis) and by the Indonesian Survey Institute published on 23 February 2012 gave him the lead – but observers and activists cast doubt on the polls. In March 2012, Gerindra named Prabowo its 2014 presidential candidate. The party's slogan was then changed to Gerindra Menang Prabowo Presiden (Gerindra Wins, Prabowo Becomes President) Prabowo said he would run an investment-friendly administration if he won and that Indonesia needed more energy exploration; furthermore, he said he had been in close contact with labor unions and believed rising worker discontent could be managed with a wise national budget. He promised to use military-style efficiency to push through chronically delayed infrastructure projects, as well as to create jobs in the archipelago's backwaters by improving agricultural productivity. Another pillar to Prabowo's platform was that he was solidly secular, and his party planned to protect the rights of minority religious groups in the Muslim-majority country. According to numerous quick counts after the 9 April legislative election, Gerinda came in third place, positioning Prabowo as one of two main presidential candidates for the election to be held 9 July, the other being Jakarta governor, Joko Widodo. On Tuesday, 20 May 2014, Golkar, along with the United Development Party (PPP), the National Mandate Party (PAN), the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), and the Crescent Star Party (PBB), officially endorsed Prabowo Subianto to run for the 2014 presidential election; the coalition collected 48.9 percent of votes and 52.1 seats in the parliament. The day before, Prabowo had picked former Coordinating Minister for Economics Hatta Rajasa as his vice-presidential running mate. Prabowo accepts the Great Indonesia Party's nomination for the 2014 presidential election in Lembah Hambalang, on 17 March 2012 On 22 July 2014, the day that the KPU was due to announce its official tally, Prabowo withdrew from the race after having insisted on his victory since the initial quick counts were released, although the majority showed Jokowi ahead. He attributed this withdrawal to Indonesia \\"fail[ing] in its duty to democracy\\" because of \\"massive cheating that is structured and systematic\\", and stated that he and Hatta \\"exercise our constitutional right to reject the presidential election and declare it unconstitutional\\". His speech, aired live, implied he would challenge the results in the Constitutional Court. Later reports indicated confusion over whether Prabowo had resigned from the election or simply rejected the count. According to Douglas Ramage of the Jakarta-based Bower's Asia Group, this was the first time since reformasi began in 1998 that the legitimacy of an election was questioned; he declared the country was entering \\"uncharted territory\\". The legality of a Prabowo challenge is questionable, as – if he withdrew – he is no longer considered a presidential candidate. If he can make the challenge, according to The Jakarta Post, the gap between the two is sufficient to make such a challenge difficult. Under the presidential election law, Prabowo could face up to six years in prison and a 100 billion rupiah ($10 million) fine for withdrawing. Later that evening, Joko Widodo was officially announced as president and began to receive congratulations from world leaders. Following the announcement, the value of the Indonesian rupiah dropped by 0.3 percent, and the JSX Composite fell by 0.9 percent. Observers denied Prabowo's allegations of cheating, finding that the elections were \\"generally fair and free\\"; Maswadi Rauf of the University of Indonesia stated that there were \\"no sign of significant fraud\\", and that Prabowo's withdrawal simply reflected \\"the real attitudes of the elite, who are not yet ready to accept losing\\". On 21 August 2014, the Indonesian Constitutional Court rejected his claim of fraud, confirming his election loss. On 12 April 2018, Prabowo announced he would contest Indonesia's 2019 presidential election if he could obtain sufficient support from other political parties. Indonesian media had speculated on whether Prabowo would become a presidential candidate or a \\"king-maker\\" giving his support to another candidate. Prabowo's brother Hashim in March 2018 said health and logistical factors had to be considered before the party announces a presidential candidate. In April 2018, John McBeth reported Maritime Coordinating Minister Luhut Panjaitan had held a series of meetings with Prabowo, culminating in the proposal of a joint Widodo-Prabowo ticket for the 2019 election. Luhut reportedly lost his enthusiasm after Prabowo allegedly said he would want to be in charge of the military and seven seats in any new cabinet. Fadli Zon denied Luhut and Prabowo had discussed politics, claiming they merely spoke about Europe's move to limit imports of Indonesian palm oil. Gerindra official Andre Rosiade also dismissed the report as a hoax. On 10 August 2018, Prabowo registered at the KPU office for the 2019 presidential election with Sandiaga Uno as his running mate and with the support of Gerindra, PKS, PAN, the Democratic Party and Berkarya Party. The Democratic Party had wanted Prabowo to choose Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono as his running mate. Following the election, 'quick counts' conducted at polling stations by independent institutions authorized by the government indicated Widodo had won by a margin of about 10%, but Prabowo claimed victory, insisting a real count by his side showed he received 62% of the vote. On 23 October 2019, Prabowo was inaugurated as Indonesia's Minister of Defence by President Joko Widodo. Minister of Defence Shortly after his inauguration, Prabowo began advocating for a \\"total people's war\\" doctrine for Indonesia's national defence. Following an incident in late 2019 where Chinese vessels violated Indonesian EEZ off the Natuna Islands, Prabowo called for a cautious response, referring to China as a \\"friendly nation\\", for which he was criticized by netizens for being \\"too soft\\". He also ordered the deployment of additional navy vessels in the region in response to the incident. Prabowo is planning to massively expand Indonesia's domestic ability to manufacture ammunition, as Indonesia's capacity to manufacture is only 450 million ammunition per year, despite a demand at 1 billion ammunition yearly. Prabowo is looking to strengthen Indonesia's military by acquiring newer fighter aircraft such as General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon from United States and Dassault Rafale from France. Despite the controversy of his inaction in Natuna Island, a poll by Indo Barometer on early January show that Prabowo is the most popular minister in Jokowi's cabinet.  Controversies  = Paradise Papers = In November 2017 an investigation conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism cited his name in the list of politicians named in \\"Paradise Papers\\" allegations. =Ghost Fleet= On 18 September 2017, at the launch of a book on his father's political economy theory, Prabowo made a speech warning Indonesia could break apart in 2030. \\"In other countries, they have made studies, where the Republic of Indonesia has been declared no more in 2030,\\" he said. A video clip of the speech was posted to Gerindra's official Facebook page on 18 March 2018. When asked which studies Prabowo was referring to, Gerindra official Elnino M. Husein Mohi said, \\"Prabowo has read various writings of people that are outside the country, intellectual observers that exist. You can also see them online.\\" It was subsequently revealed the \\"studies\\" were actually a 2015 science-fiction war novel called Ghost Fleet by American authors August Cole and P.W. Singer. A note by the authors at the start of the book states: \\"The following was inspired by real- world trends and technologies. But, ultimately, it is a work of fiction, not prediction.\\" Bemused by Prabowo citing the book, Singer posted on Twitter: \\"Indonesian opposition leader cites #GhostFleet in fiery campaign speeches... There have been many unexpected twists and turns from this book experience, but this may take the cake.\\" =Haiti gaffe= In late 2018, Prabowo was ridiculed after erroneously stating that Haiti, a republic in the Caribbean, is an African country. In a speech made on 23 December 2018 in Solo, Central Java, Prabowo said the Indonesian government had driven part of Indonesia's wealth offshore. \\"If this continues to go on, Indonesia will continue to be impoverished,\\" he said. \\"We, Indonesians, are on par with African impoverished countries such as Rwanda, Haiti, and small islands like Kiribati, which we don't even know where it's located,\\" he added. =2019 presidential debate= On 17 January 2019, in the first debate between the candidates in Indonesia's April 2019 presidential election, Prabowo said some Indonesian governors deserve higher salaries considering the size of their provinces. He gave the example of Central Java province, which he claimed is larger than Malaysia (in population) . Local media reports pointed out that Central Java is 32,544.12 square kilometers, while Malaysia is 330,323 square kilometers. After the media reported on the error, Prabowo's campaign team claimed he had actually been referring to the population totals of Malaysia and Central Java. In the same debate, Prabowo claimed that terrorist attacks in Indonesia were caused by poverty and perpetrated by non-Muslims disguised as Muslims, sent by other countries and controlled by foreigners. Media reports refuted his claims, pointing out that some Indonesian terrorist bombers were not poor and were not manipulated by foreigners.

It is the first competitive fighting game produced by the company and the first installment in the Street Fighter series. While it did not achieve the same worldwide popularity as its sequel Street Fighter II when it was first released, the original Street Fighter introduced some of the conventions made standard in later games, such as the six button controls and the use of command based special techniques. A port for the PC Engine/TurboGrafx CD console was released under the title in 1988. This version was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in 2009. Gameplay Screenshot of Ryu versus Retsu The player competes in a series of one-on-one matches against a series of computer-controlled opponents or in a single match against another player. Each match consists of three rounds in which the player must knock out an opponent in less than 30 seconds. If a match ends before a fighter is knocked out, the fighter with the greater amount of energy left will be declared the round's winner. The player must win two rounds in order to defeat the opponent and proceed to the next battle. If the third round ends in a tie, then the computer-controlled opponent will win by default or both players will lose. During the single-player mode, the player can continue after losing and fight against the opponent they lost the match to. Likewise, a second player can interrupt a single-player match and challenge the first player to a new match. In the deluxe version of the arcade game, the player's controls consist of a standard eight-way joystick and two large, unique mechatronic pads for punches and kicks that returned an analog value depending on how hard the player actuated the control. An alternate version was released that replaces the two punching pads with an array of six attack buttons, three punch buttons and three kick buttons of different speed and strength (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player uses the joystick to move towards or away from an opponent, as well as to jump, crouch and defend against an opponent's attacks. By using the attack buttons/pads in combination with the joystick, the player can perform a variety of attacks from a standing, jumping or crouching positions. There are three special techniques which can only be performed by inputting a specific series of joystick and button inputs. These techniques are:  . This was the first game to use such a concept. Unlike the subsequent Street Fighter sequels and other fighting games, the specific commands for these special moves are not given in the arcade game's instruction card, which instead encouraged the player to discover these techniques on their own.All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000, pg. 12 The single-player mode consists of a series of battles against ten opponents from five different nations.All About Capcom Head-to- Head Fighting Game 1987-2000, pg. 11 At the beginning of the game, the player can choose the country where their first match will take place: the available choices are Japan or the United States, as well as China or England (depending on the game's configuration). The player will proceed to fight against two fighters from the chosen country before proceeding to the next country. In addition to the regular battles, there are two types of bonus games which players can participate in for additional points: a brick-breaking bonus game and a table breaking bonus game. After defeating the initial eight characters, the player will travel to Thailand to fight against the last two opponents. Characters The player takes control of a young Japanese martial artist named Ryu, who competes in an international martial arts tournament to prove his strength,All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000, pg. 345 while the second player takes control of Ryu's former training partner and rival Ken, who challenges Ryu in the game's 2-player matches.All About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000, pg. 310 Normally the player takes control of Ryu in the single-player mode; however, if the player controlling Ken defeats Ryu in a 2-player match, the winning player will play the remainder of the game as Ken.

The two men would leave Capcom after the production of the game and were employed by SNK, developing most of their fighting game series (including Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting). The duo would later work for Dimps and work on Street Fighter IV with Capcom. Keiji Inafune, best known for his artwork in Capcom's Mega Man franchise, got his start at the company by designing and illustrating the character portraits in Street Fighter. Nishiyama drew several inspirations for developing the original gameplay of Street Fighter from martial art styles he was practicing at the time. The game's designers at Capcom took inspiration from Bruce Lee's 1973 martial arts film Enter the Dragon. Both Enter the Dragon and Street Fighter are similarly centered around an international fighting tournament, with each character having a unique combination of ethnicity, nationality and fighting style. In terms of gameplay, Karate Champ (1984), Kung-Fu Master (1984), and Yie Ar Kung Fu (1985) provided a basic template for Capcom's Street Fighter. Release =Arcade variants= pressure-sensitive arcade control system Two different arcade cabinet were sold for the game: a \\"Regular\\" version (which was sold as a tabletop cabinet in Japan and as an upright overseas) that featured the same six button configuration later used in Street Fighter II and a \\"Deluxe\\" cabinet that featured two pressure-sensitive rubber pads. The pressure- sensitive pads determine the strength and speed of the player's attacks based on how hard they were pressed. In the worldwide versions of the game, Ryu's and Ken's voices were dubbed so that they yelled the names of their moves in English (i.e.: Psycho Fire, Dragon Punch, Hurricane Kick). Subsequent localized releases up until Street Fighter IV left the Japanese voices intact; starting from Street Fighter IV going forward, subsequent games in the series contain English voice acting, although characters from Asia still use Japanese names for certain special moves and super combos amidst otherwise English dialogue. =Home versions= Street Fighter was ported under the title Fighting Street in 1988 for the PC Engine CD-ROM² System in JapanAll About Capcom Head-to-Head Fighting Game 1987-2000, pg. 10 and 1989 for the TurboGrafx-CD in North America. This version features a remastered soundtrack. As there was no six-button controller for the TurboGrafx-CD at the time this version was released, the strength level of the attacks is determined by how long either of the action buttons are held, akin to the \\"Deluxe\\" version of the arcade game. This version was published by NEC Avenue in North America and Hudson Soft in Japan and was developed by Alfa System. The cover artwork featured Mount Rushmore, which was one of the locations in the game. This version was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on October 6, 2009, in North America on November 2, 2009 and in the PAL regions on November 6, 2009. Versions of Street Fighter for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amiga and Atari ST were published by U.S. Gold in 1988 in Europe. These ports were developed by Tiertex. A DOS version was developed my Micro Talent and published by Capcom USA. The Commodore 64 received two versions, released on the same tape/disk format - the NTSC (U.S.) version developed by Pacific Dataworks and published by Capcom USA, and the PAL (UK) version by Tiertex and U.S. Gold. This edition of Street Fighter was featured in two compilations: Arcade Muscle and Multimixx 3, both of which featured other U.S. Gold- published ports of Capcom games such as Bionic Commando and 1943: The Battle of Midway. Hi-Tech Expressions ported the game to MS-DOS computers. Hi-Tech re-released the game as part of the Street Fighter Series CD-ROM collection. An emulation of the original arcade version is featured in Capcom Arcade Hits Volume 1 (along with Street Fighter II': Champion Edition) for Windows, Capcom Classics Collection Remixed for the PlayStation Portable and Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 (along with Super Street Fighter II Turbo) for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. An emulation of the original arcade version is featured in the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Windows Reception The game was commercially successful in arcades. In Japan, Game Machine listed Street Fighter on their September 15, 1987 issue as being the fifth most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. On the Coinslot charts, printed in the August 1988 issue of Sinclair User, Street Fighter was the top dedicated arcade game. The arcade version was well received. Tony Thompson of Crash, in its October 1987 issue, said it \\"breathes new life\\" into martial arts games, with a \\"huge\\" cabinet, \\"big\\" characters, pads where \\"the harder you hit the pads the harder your character hits\\", and \\"secret techniques\\". In its January 1988 issue, Julian Rignall and Daniel Gilbert said \\"it adds a new dimension with pneumatic punch buttons\\" and the action is \\"gratifying\\" with \\"great feedback from the buttons\\" but \\"there's very little to draw you back\\" after the novelty wears off. Clare Edgeley of Computer and Video Games, in its December 1987 issue, said it had \\"huge\\" sprites, \\"among the most realistic\\" characters, and \\"intense\\" action, but requires mastering the controls, including punches, kicks, stoop kicks, flip kicks and backward flips. She said \\"the competition is intense\\" and the deluxe version \\"is much more fun.\\" Sinclair User awarded the game a maximum and claiming it was \\"one of the games of the year\\", while Computer and Video Games said it had \\"no lasting appeal whatsoever\\". =Legacy= Street Fighter found its own niche in the gaming world, partly because many arcade game developers in the 1980s focused more on producing beat-em-up and shoot 'em up games. Part of the game's appeal was the use of special moves that could only be discovered by experimenting with the game controls, which created a sense of mystique and invited players to practice the game. Following Street Fighters lead, the use of command-based hidden moves began to pervade other games in the rising fighting game genre. Street Fighter introduced other staples of the genre, including the blocking technique as well as the ability for a challenger to jump in and initiate a match against a player at any time. The game introduced pressure-sensitive controls that determine the strength of an attack. However, due to causing damaged arcade cabinets, Capcom replaced it soon after with a six-button control scheme offering light, medium and hard punches and kicks, which became another staple of the genre.Nadia Oxford, 20 Years of Street Fighter , 1UP.com, November 12, 2007 Sega's hack and slash beat 'em up Golden Axe (1989) was influenced by the original Street Fighter. Golden Axe lead designer Makoto Uchida cited the original Street Fighter as an influence, particularly how players could combine button movies and stick presses to perform individual attacks. Capcom's beat 'em up Final Fight (1989) began development as a sequel called Street Fighter '89. According to the developers, they were originally planning to have Ryu and Ken from the original Street Fighter as the main protagonists, but that idea was scrapped for a new plot and setting. SNK's fighting game Fatal Fury: King of Fighters (1991) was designed by Takashi Nishiyama, the director of the original Street Fighter. Nishiyama envisioned Fatal Fury as a spiritual successor to Street Fighter. It was developed around the same time as Street Fighter II (1991). While Street Fighter II placed more emphasis on combos, Fatal Fury placed more emphasis on the timing of special moves as well as storytelling.

She is perhaps best known for playing Millie Hutchins on the television comedy The Andy Griffith Show and Millie Swanson on Mayberry R.F.D., and often portrayed bubbly, eccentric blondes in supporting character roles on stage, film, and television. Early years Golonka was born in Chicago in 1936 of Polish descent. She worked as a waitress before she began acting and began her acting career in her early teens, going professional in a summer-stock troupe. After studying at the prestigious Goodman Theatre in Chicago, she made her way to New York City, where she studied with Lee Strasberg, Sanford Meisner and Uta Hagen. Career A life member of The Actors Studio, she appeared in her first major production, The Night Circus, with Ben Gazzara, at the Shubert Theater in New Haven, Connecticut on November 17, 1958. After a week-long trial run, the play moved to Broadway on December 2, 1958, but closed after only seven performances.Arlene Golonka profile, IBDb.com; accessed April 27, 2014. Despite that setback, she continued working in other plays such as Take Me Along with Jackie Gleason, Walter Pidgeon and Robert Morse (448 performances from late 1959 to late 1960), Neil Simon's first Broadway play, Come Blow Your Horn, which ran 677 performances from February 1961 until October 1962, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, starring Kirk Douglas, from November 1963 until January 1964. Golonka appeared in two other Broadway plays from 1965-66, and took supporting roles in films produced in the New York City area. Golonka also appeared on record, in a well-received comedy album called You Don't Have to Be Jewish, in 1965. When the time came to record its sequel, When You're in Love the Whole World Is Jewish, she was unavailable, but encouraged her roommate, aspiring actress Valerie Harper, to audition to take her place.

Owned and operated by iHeartMedia, its studios are located in Phoenix near Sky Harbor Airport and its transmitter is in South Mountain Park. Despite the station's call sign and former \\"The Coyote\\" branding (used from 1993 to 2011), there is no affiliation of any kind with the Arizona Coyotes, the local National Hockey League team. (The KYOT call letters came before the original Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix and became the Coyotes in the late 1990s.) History On July 29, 1956, at 6 p.m., KELE signed on the air as the second FM station in the city of Phoenix, joining KFCA, the radio station of Phoenix College, which began transmissions in 1951. The construction permit for the station, which bore the KONI-FM callsign for the first 19 days of its permit history in 1955, was owned by James T. Ownby; before signing on, Ownby sold the station to ANJO Broadcasters and Telecasters, which moved the station from the original 98.5 dial position to 95.5. In 1962, KELE was sold to Camelback Broadcasting; the next year, after being off the air for several months, KELE became KRFM with an easy listening music format. Camelback promptly sold KRFM to Arizona FM. Following an acquisition by Harte-Hanks, on January 15, 1978, the call letters were changed to KQYT, retaining its easy listening music format, branded as \\"Quiet 95“. On July 22, KQYT accidentally made a false alarm by accidentally playing the \\"White Card\\" Emergency Broadcast System Emergency Action Notification in the middle of their station ID, unlike WCCO- AM in Minneapolis, MN and WOWO-AM in Fort Wayne, IN 7 years prior.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3U3t7s4fJU On July 10, 1986, the format was changed to adult top 40, branded as \\"Y-95\\". The call letters were changed to KOY-FM. The station later evolved to a top 40 music format. The station gained some national attention in the late 1980s when they hired Jessica Hahn, a central figure in the Jim Bakker PTL scandal, as an on-air DJ. The station also helped to start the careers of Arizona disk jockeys Tim Hattrick and Glenn Beck. The station competed heavily against KKFR (then at 92.3 FM, now on 98.3) and KZZP, and Phoenix was considered to be the best market for fans of Top 40. However, due to the changing nature of the format in the late 1980s and early 1990s in terms of musical tastes, personalities and personnel changes, KZZP flipped to the then-new Hot AC format in April 1991, leaving KKFR and KOY-FM to battle for themselves. However, despite KOY-FM picking up a good percentage of KZZP's former audience, the station dropped in the ratings, well below KKFR, which moved towards a more upbeat, rhythmic direction to compete against KOY-FM's own rhythmic/dance direction. To combat this, in late 1992, KOY-FM began a \\"dayparting\\" approach, by playing more safe and mainstream pop/rock content during the day, and less mainstream hip hop/rock/dance product at night. However, a few months later, the station reverted to its previous sound. With all the changes, the station continued to deteriorate in the ratings. On September 2, 1993, at Noon, the station began stunting, airing loops of quotes from famous people and figures from American pop culture and history, branded as \\"America's Radio Museum\\". The following day, the station flipped to a \\"rhythm and rock\\" format branded as \\"The Coyote\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-09-10.pdf A change of call letters to KYOT-FM followed to match its new branding. KYOT-FM's logo as a smooth jazz station On March 14, 1994, at 6:30 PM, the format was changed to a successful smooth jazz format, but retaining its branding as \\"The Coyote\\", with actor Geoffrey Holder providing the station's voice-over during its tenure.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-03-18.pdf Nick Francis, previously the program director of KKNW in Seattle and the music director of KKSF in San Francisco, programmed KYOT-FM to a ratings height of #1 12+ at one point in the late 1990s. At the time it changed to smooth jazz, KYOT-FM was owned by Sundance Communications. Several ownership changes in the late 1990s would see KYOT-FM become a property of Colfax, Chancellor, AMFM and eventually Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) in 2000. Between 2000 and 2010, KYOT-FM maintained strong 12+ ratings, but eventually saw a similar aging of the audience that other smooth jazz stations experienced. Francis' role as program director was downsized, and the smooth jazz format of KYOT-FM never regained its dominance. In 2010, the station began mixing some soft adult contemporary music into the mix, similar to what was being done at KTWV in Los Angeles. By January 2011, KYOT-FM was playing less smooth jazz and more AC-sounding pop/R&B; recurrents and classic/old school pop and R&B; songs. By that June, KYOT-FM officially moved to rhythmic adult contemporary, playing mostly rhythmic pop/R&B; hits from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. On August 31, 2011, KYOT-FM was rebranded as \\"Eva 95.5,\\" first playing rhythmic oldies. By October 2013, KYOT-FM shifted back to a Rhythmic AC direction by adding current Rhythmic Pop and R&B; material to its selection while maintaining a majority of older Rhythmic product. On January 10, 2014, at 5 p.m., KYOT-FM changed their format to adult hits (filling the format void after KPKX flipped to sports earlier that week), branded as \\"95.5 The Mountain.\\"http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/87368/mountain-rises-in- phoenix/ The final song on \\"Eva\\" was \\"End of the Road\\" by Boyz II Men, while the first song on \\"The Mountain\\" was \\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\" by Bon Jovi. The station modified its call sign to simply KYOT on September 18, 2018. HD radio KYOT's HD radio signal is multiplexed. HD1 is a simulcast of The Mountain's adult hits format. HD2 carries the format of sister station KFYI 550 AM. The HD3 is leased out to KNLB in Lake Havasu City to feed translator K240DC 95.9.

History Muslims of Manipur, known as Pangal, have existed (formerly Poirei or Meitrabak or Mekhli/Mughlai or Kathe) since the seventh century. \\"Pangal\\" simply means \\"Manipuri Muslims\\", as they follow Islam. Various historical sources have different dates for when Islam first entered Manipur. Some sources place the date at around 930 AD. However, the date all sources seem to confirm as definitive is 1606 AD. The origin of the Pangal community is equally varied. In the early-seventeenth century, Mubariz Khan was on an expedition and came across a tribe which lived in between the lands of the Khasis and the Kacharis, who referred to themselves as Mughals. The Mughal books claim that this tribe was indeed a descendant of the Turco-Mongol Timurids. They have said that during the reign of Timur in the late 12th century, the emperor had reached this extreme point and left a group of Mongols to protect the land before returning to his capital in Baghdad. Members of this tribe were white- skinned, spoke a Sino-Tibetan language, ate all sorts of animals and vegetables, and wore large turbans and big brass earrings (tunkal). Mubariz managed to defeat this tribe with a lot of difficulty, and annexed some of their land to the Bengal Subah. It is considered that this tribe were Meitei as they speak Meitei, which is a Sino-Tibetan language. In Assam and Greater Sylhet, Meiteis used to be referred to as \\"Mei-Moglai\\". In the sources that place their entry prior to 1606, they entered as gun makers or to extract salt from the brine springs. However, the events of 1606 state that they settled after Prince Sanongba requested aid from Cachari King Dimasha Prataphil to defeat his brother Chingsomba. Dimasha Prataphil was aware of Chingsomba's military strength and knew that his forces alone could not win. Hence, he requested the Nawab of Taraf, Muhammad Nazir to send forces to his aid. After the war with his brother Sanongba, Maharaj Khangemba and the Muslim soldiers from Taraf signed an agreement and allowed the Muslim soldiers to settle in the valleys of Manipur. In the meanwhile Burmese army broke a war against Kangleipak in Kabaw valley. King Khagemba asked the brave soldiers to help Meetei army to fight with Burma (Myanmar), agreed and fought the battle alongside Meetei army. Fortunately, Meetei army won the battle. King Khagemba was very happy with that and his highness gave the name Pangal (Pangal= Strength in Meetei lenguage ) Through marriage, adopting the Meitei language and various local practices, which did not violate Islam, the Muslim soldiers were eventually naturalised as the Pangals. The etymology of the name is also interesting as some say it account from a Persian source states that the name Pangal was given due to their fortitude in battle, and the Pangal means ‘strength’ in Meiteilon. The Muslims of Manipur were result of two Muslim migrations in 1606 and 1724. Manipur provided shelter to Shah Shuja, the Mughal prince who fled (and was pursued) to save himself from the wrath of his brother Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. According to Henry Rule Kathe, Muslims are the result of intermixing (melting pot) of Muslims coming in different eras from different directions – Bengal, Arakan, Cachar and Manipur itself. Silk- spinning was a trade widely practised by them.Pangali Musalman: Manipuri Muslims The Muslim Pangals of Manipur devastated and were taken as slaves by the invading Burmese armies.The Muslims of Manipur While some Muslims were already living in Manipur, there was a significant influx of Muslims from 1660 onwards, as refugees followed the deposing of the Mughal Shah Shuja (Shangkusum) of Hindustan, who lost a war of succession to Aurangzeb. Shuja's flight is significant in the Islamic folklore of both north east India and Bangladesh. On 6 June 1660, Shuja fled from Dacca (Dhaka), initially intent on travelling, via Chittagong to Arakan (Rakhine).Niccolai Manucci, Storia do Mogor or History of Mughal India, translator William IrvineSuhas Chatterjee, 2008, The Socio-Economic History of South Assam. Arakan, capital of the Mrauk U Kingdom, was the destination, because Sanda Sudamma (Thudamma) had reportedly promised to provide ships to take Shuja and his entourage to Mecca for haj (pilgrimage). Shaju travelled with his wife Piari Banu Begum (a.k.a. Praveen Banu, Piara Banu, or Pai Ribanu) and her sister Sabe Banu, his sons Zainul Abidin (Zainibuddin, Bon Sultan or Sultan Bang), Buland Akhtar and Zain-ul-Din Muhammad (Zainul Abedi), and daughters Gulrukh Banu, Roshanara Begum and Amina Begum,Stanley Lane-Pool, 1971, Aurangzeb, vol.1. as well as two vessels of gold and silver, jewels, treasures and other royal trappings, on the backs of half a dozen camels, while about 1,000 palanquins (carriers) transported Shuja's harem. After staying for some time at Chittagong, Shuja took a land route (still called Shuja Road) southward. Shuja prayed the Eid prayer at a place called Edgoung (meaning eidgah) in Dulahazra. The part crossed the Naf River, half a mile north of Maungdaw, which is sometimes still known as \\"Shuja Village\\". The final leg was a sea voyage to Arakan where Shuja was received by an envoy of king Sanda Sudamma and escorted to quarters provided for him. However, after Shuja arrived in Arakan, Sudama reportedly reneged on this promise and confiscated some of Shuja's treasure. In retaliation, Zainul Abidin and another brother led a Mughal attack on Sudama and almost succeeded in setting fire to the royal palace. Two or three of Shuja's sons died in subsequent fighting and/or the Mughals' flight into the jungle. Many other Mughals were massacred. Shuja's daughter Gulrukh reportedly committed suicide after being captured and raped by Sudama. The surviving members of Shaju's party, helped reportedly by Mughals and Pathans resident at Arakan,Niccolai Manucci, Storia do Mogor. travelled north with Portuguese mariners, at a high cost in gold and jewels. The Hindu kings of Tripura and Manipur were more agreeable hosts – probably because they did not like the expansionist policy of Aurangzeb – and played a crucial role in concealing Shuja's whereabouts. He and his party arrived at Tripura on 16 May 1661, and in Manipur in December 1661.Cheitharol Kumbaba, 1989. Conscious that Aurangzeb’s scouts and spies were searching for them,Janab Khan, 1972, Manipuri Muslim also locally called \\"Moughlai Muslim\\". misinformation was spread that Shuja had died at Arakan, or was travelling to Mecca, among other stories. Among other precautionary measures, Shuja was sent by elephant to the hill country of Ukhrul.see also How Shuja, Brother of Aurangzeb died (sic) at Ukhrul; he actually died and was buried at Kairang Shujalok. Mir Jumla II came to know of the situation and sent three men to Manipur in late December 1661, to detain and retrieve Shuja's family.A. Hakim Shah, 2008, The Manipur Governance However, the Qazi of Manipur, Muhammad Sani, detained the chief emissary of the Mughals, Nur Beg to ensure that the others, Dur Beg and Rustam Beg, did not provide information regarding Shuja’s presence in Manipur.Names of Mughal ambassadors can be known from P. Gogoi, 1961, The Tai and Tai Kingdoms who gave Dur Beg and Rustam; Kheiruddin Khullakpam, 1997, Turko- Afghangi Chada Naoda, Lilong: Circles, gives the Boggy clan ancestor as Noor Bakhsh that must be Noor Beg. At that time, Shuja was in hiding at a cave known later as Shuja-lok (\\"Shuja Cave\\"),Janab Khan, 1972, Manipuri Muslim. Haignang, Kairang (east of Imphal). According to some accounts he later died at the cave. The Manipuri Muslims are the descendants of the invaded soldiers from the Sylhet and the local women. The king of Manipur gave their surname based on their profession. For example, fundreimayum was the surname given to those who worked on lathe. Likewise, Chesam was given as surname to those who worked in paper industry. Among the Manipuri Muslims, Fundreimayum and Yumkhaibam Clan are Turko-Afghan descendants. Their ancestors were Pathans and they are the descandants of Kundan Khan and Zamman Khan who were Pathans. The First Chief Minister of Manipur, Alimmudin was from the Fundreimayum clan of Manipuri Muslims. =Population= Their present population is 239,886, making up 8.40% of the state of Manipur population as per 2011 census. Pangal mostly settled in the periphery of Manipur near River bank, near lake and foothills. The Pangals are mainly concentrated in and around Imphal, the capital of Manipur and Thoubal. There is large number of pangals live in Cachar in Assam, Hojai in Assam, Komolpur in Tripura and Bangladesh. It is believed that the ancestors of the Pangals settled in this region are migrated from Manipur during the seven years devastation also known as Chahi-Taret Khuntakpa, the black period in the history of Manipur when Burmese invasions of Assam and their conquest of Manipur around 1815 AD. Culture Today there are more than 50 Muslim family title names. They are an indigenous and peace-loving community. Traditional dress for men is Lungis and pajamas, and for women is Kurtis, Shalwar and phanek. Both also wear western attire. They maintained their own identity though they assimilated and intermixed with the other local communities. =Stratification= Pangals are divided into 77 clans or family titles. *The Ayekpam descend from an early seventh-century artist. Ayekpam translates to \\"the one who paints\\". *The Baseimayum descend from an eighth- century kingdom in Sylhet known as Basa (or Pasha). However, R.B. Pemberton suggests this kingdom was in Cachar. *The Makak trace their heritage as the founders of the 12th-century Barmaqam Powa Makkah, renovated by the 15th- century Sultan of Bengal Alauddin Husain Shah. They are divided into three clans: #The Makakyum Ariba clan are descended from a member of the Banu Makhzum tribe in Makkah. Their ancestors reached Chittagong in 636 CE. #The Makak Amuba clan are descended from Lukhiyarful, who is a descendant of Nurullah Herati, the Subahdar of Kamrup/Shujabad in 1677 - who comes from Herat, Afghanistan. #The Makak Angouba clan are descended from Sunarful, who is a descendant of Lutfullah Shirazi - a Mughal officer. *The Malsam are descended from an early seventeenth-century man called Malsa who migrated to Manipur from the Brahmaputra Valley. *The Mansam are descended from a seventeenth-century man who migrated to Manipur from the Surma Valley.  Discrimination  = Violence and racism = Despite the fact the Pangals have had a long history in the area, share much cultural traits with their non-Muslim neighbors, and have generally lived in peace as a minority; they have faced discrimination, marginalization, and Islamophobia from the Manipuri government, other political actors and fellow Manipuris. Common stereotypes held by Meiteis and other non-Pangals is that the Pangals are anti-social and prone to theivery. The 1993 Pangal massacre saw the death of around 130 Pangals and the burning of their homes. False rumors spread by Meiteis alleged that Pangals molested Meitei college students. This led mobs to kill and assault Pangal men and women and destroying Pangal-owned stores. The police were criticized for doing little to curtail the violence or stop the misinformation. The rise of the BJP in Manipur since 2016 has lead to a rise of hate crimes against Pangals. Attacks and lynchings on Pangals were reported. Since the BJP got in power in Manipur in 2017, many Pangals have experienced discrimination and Islamophobia. Yumnam Devjit, the son of politicianYumnam Joykumar Singh, wrote in a facebook post that the Qurbani ritual done during Eid al- Adha \\"was nothing but training for Muslims to kill.\\" In September 2018, a Pangal man named Mohamed Farooq Khan was lynched by a mob and the video of his lynching was soon spread throughout social media. He allegedly stole a scooter which was the mob's motivation for the lynching but there was also another more likely possibility that Khan was wrongfully framed for the theft. This incident had led many Pangals to fear for their safety. = Political marginalization = Pangals have little political representation in the Manipuri government and institutions with very few Pangals holding political office. The Manpuri government refused to include a Muslim representative during the drafting of the for the Protection of Manipuri People proposed by the State Government on May 23, 2018. The bill was meant to prevent Rohingyas (and certain other migrants) from settling in Manipur. A common view held by non-muslim Manipuris is that the Pangals give asylum to the Rohingyas and place much blame on them for the imagined offense. The Inner Line Permit bill saw many Manipuris protest for its implementation. Some Pangals believed that the wording of the bill was vague about its definition of being a \\"original settler\\" of Manipur and that it excluded Pangals by not explicitly acknowledging them. According to advocates, this ambiguity can mean that Pangals can be targeted along with other Muslims from Assam, Bengal and Bihar. The Pangals have received a disproportionate amount of aid from the government compared to the Meiteis and other native groups in the area. The implementation of the KGBV program saw itself established among the Naga and Kukis but not in areas with sizable Pangal populations. The four percent reservation for government jobs is also poorly implemented for the Pangals. Access to higher education, healthcare, and employment are also dismal. = Displacement = According to a researcher at Mizoram University, the Pangals have experienced the loss of some of their land in a more frequent rate after the 1993 Pangal massacre. There were some instances in where the Manpuri government forced Pangals to leave their residences in a allegedly reserve forest and paddy rice area and deployed the police and environmental laws to execute the evictions. The Pangals have noy yet been given compensation for these evictions. Advocates have also pointed out that comparable areas inhabited by Meiteis face much less scrutiny and evictions. Chingiz Khan writing for Manipur Daily also stated that these actions by the state has encouraged other native groups in the area to threaten Pangals and their businesses to vacate the place.

Any vehicle travelling along with the green wave (at an approximate speed decided upon by the traffic engineers) will see a progressive cascade of green lights, and not have to stop at intersections. This allows higher traffic loads, and reduces noise and energy use (because less acceleration and braking is needed). In practical use, only a group of cars (known as a \\"platoon\\", the size of which is defined by the signal times) can use the green wave before the time band is interrupted to give way to other traffic flows. The coordination of the signals is sometimes done dynamically, according to sensor data of currently existing traffic flows - otherwise it is done statically, by the use of timers. Under certain circumstances, green waves can be interwoven with each other, but this increases their complexity and reduces usability, so in conventional set-ups only the roads and directions with the heaviest loads get this preferential treatment. In 2011, a study modeled the implementation of green waves during the night in a busy Manchester suburb (Chorlton-cum-Hardy) using S-Paramics microsimulation and the AIRE emissions module.Traffic Engineering & Control, Volume: 53, Issue Number: 2, Hemming Group, Limited, , http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=1136945 The results showed using green wave signal setups on a network have the potential to: Typical Signal Schedule and Traffic Flow Diagram, North-South across Market (1929) From Signal Timing Schedule for Traffic Control Plan, June 15, 1929.

A green wave in both directions may be possible with different speed recommendations for each direction, otherwise traffic coming from one direction may reach the traffic light faster than from the other direction if the distance from the previous traffic light is not mathematically a multiple of the opposite direction. Alternatively a dual carriageway may be suitable for green waves in both directions if there is sufficient space in the central reservation to allow pedestrians to wait and separate pedestrian crossing stages for each side of the road.Traffic Engineering & Control, Volume: 53, Issue Number: 2, Hemming Group, Limited, , Green waves are sometimes used to facilitate bicycle traffic. Copenhagen,\\"30.000 cyclists get green traffic light wave\\" Copenhagen Capacity, accessed Jan 28,2008 Amsterdam,\\"Green wave for cyclists tested\\" News from Amsterdam, http://www.nieuwsuitamsterdam.nl/English/2007/11/green_wave.htm San Francisco, and other cities may synchronize traffic signals to provide a green light for a flow of cyclists. On San Francisco's Valencia Street, the signals were retimed in early 2009 to provide a green wave in both directions, possibly the first street in the world with a two-way green wave for cyclists. In Copenhagen, a green wave on the arterial street Nørrebrogade facilitates 30,000 cyclists to maintain a 12 mph (19.3 km/h) speed for 2.5 kilometers. In Amsterdam, cyclists riding at a speed of 15 to 18 km/h will be able to travel without being stopped by a red signal. Tests show that public transport can benefit as well and cars may travel slightly slower. In Vienna, Austria a stretch of cycle path on Lassellestrasse in the 2nd district has a display that tells cyclists their speed and the speed they must maintain to make the next green light. Frederiksberg, a part of Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, has implemented a green wave for emergency vehicles to improve the public services. In the UK, in 2009, it was revealed that the Department for Transport had previously discouraged green waves as they reduced fuel usage, and thus less revenue was raised from fuel taxes.DfT (2004) WebTag Unit 3.5.3 - Transport User Benefit Calculation Despite this government Webtag documents were only updated in 2011. It is still unclear if the economic appraisal software used to apply these guidelines has also been updated and if the new guidelines are being applied to new projects. In a more limited sense, the term Green wave has also been applied to railroad travel. For several years starting in the 1960s, the German Federal Railway maintained an advertising campaign featuring the slogan garantiert grüne Welle (Guaranteed Green Wave), which communicated the notion of speed, limited delays and open track blocks to potential customers choosing between train and automobile travel, and was featured prominently in promotional materials ranging from posters to radio jingles.

It was a test case in which it was sought to establish a basis upon which stevedores could claim the protection of exceptions and limitations contained in a bill of lading contract to which they were not party. Dockray - \\"Cases & Materials on the Carriage of Goods by Sea\\" - Cavendish The Court outlined an exception to the privity rule, known as the Lord Reid test, through agency as it applies to sub-contractors and employees seeking protection in their employers' contract. Facts Scruttons Ltd was shipping a load of crates through a carrier. In the contract between the two parties there was a limitation of liability clause for $500 (£179) per box. The goods were damaged in transit due to the negligence of the stevedores. The stevedores were under contract with the shipping company which contained an exclusion clause. Midland were unaware of the relationship between the carriers and the stevedores. Judgment At first blush, it was clear to the Court that the stevedores could not be exempted by the exemption clause as there was no privity of contract. The Court looked at whether there was a bailment relationship but found none. The case turned on the application of the Elder, Dempster caseElder, Dempster & Co. Ltd. v. Paterson, Zochonis & Co. Ltd. [1924] A.C. 522 which suggested that privity could be circumvented. Lord Reid proposed that the stevedores could be covered under the contractual clause through agency if certain pre-conditions were satisfied. All of Lord Reid's preconditions were satisfied in the subsequent case of New Zealand Shipping v Satterthwaite (The Eurymedon) [1975] AC 154. The Scruttons case followed an earlier case with similar reasoning, Adler v Dickson (The Himalaya). Significance With the Scruttons case, the issue of third party rights in a contract were made certain. There had been much speculation on the meaning of Elder, Dempster but it became clear that there was no new rule from that case. This case, among others, resulted in the change of practice in shipping contracts by adding Himalaya clauses to protect third parties.

Founded in 1922 by a group of Rotary Clubs, it sought to emulate the success of the American Easter Seals program. Today, Easter Seals is set up as a federated structure led by Easter Seals Canada which represents the organization's national interests, and provincially-licensed member organizations in each of the ten provinces that directly provide a range of programs and services locally. Across Canada, Easter Seals supports over 40,000 children, youth, adults and their families each year. The best-known and largest of Easter Seals services are the summer camp programs. There are 12 Easter Seals accessible camp facilities across Canada that are geared towards providing camp opportunities to over 4600 children with physical and/or mental disabilities, including cerebral palsy, autism, muscular dystrophy, and spina bifida. Set-up and activities offered at the camps differ from location to location but in general, the camps provide participants with opportunities to participate in a range of activities such as: sledge hockey, adaptive archery, basketball, rock climbing, accessible High Ropes, canoeing and rafting, swimming, arts and crafts, music and drama, campfires, camping in a tent, and more. The camps welcome children, youth and adults, and families, and are provided at a heavily subsidized rate or at no cost to the families. In addition to the summer camps, Easter Seals also provides a range of other programs and services. These differ from province to province but include financial assistance for mobility equipment, assistive devices and technologies such as adaptive computers and communication aids, and wheelchair-accessibility modifications to vehicles and homes; academic bursaries and scholarships; year-round adaptive sports and recreational programs; employment preparation and job training services; respite services and accommodations in urban centers for families travelling for medical treatment; and social enterprise services. The Easter Seals Drop Zone, a multi-city event, is one of the organization's key fundraisers. National programs =Access 2 Card Program= Designed to promote social integration and well-being, and reduce the financial burden on persons who are living with disabilities who require assistance of a support person, the award-winning Access 2 Card Program is an initiative developed by Easter Seals in partnership with Cineplex Entertainment. For a nominal fee, persons who are living with permanent disabilities can obtain an Access 2 Card which then provides the cardholder with either a free or a discounted ticket for a support person that is accompanying them while the cardholder pays the regular admission price to the facility. The card is valid at Cineplex movie theatres across Canada and over 500 other entertainment, cultural and recreational venues such as museums, art galleries, zoos, historical sites, and aquariums.Access 2 Entertainment Card, Easter Seals Canada; Attractions , Access 2 Entertainment Card.

The event echoes similar events like Pink Shirt Day (anti-bullying) and Orange Shirt Day (solidarity with Indigenous Peoples in Canada) in that it seeks to honour and value the contributions of Canadians of all abilities - particularly those who are living with disabilities, raise awareness among Canadians of all ages about challenges and barriers that continue to impact the lives of people who are living with disabilities and their families, and promote actions to create a truly accessible and inclusive society in Canada. Awards In 2014, Easter Seals Canada was awarded The Tourism Industry Associate of Ontario’s (TIAO) Award of Excellence for Accessible Tourism for its Access 2 Card and Disability Travel Card programs. Easter Seals is the first recipient of this award, which celebrates the efforts made to make tourism destinations available to all Canadians, regardless of abilities.

It has a population of around 10,000 and is located at the Polish-Czech border, just across from the Czech town of Náchod, some west of Polish Kłodzko and from Prague. Kudowa-Zdrój is one of the oldest European spa towns where heart and circulatory system diseases were cured. The downtown area features a park styled on 17th century revival, with exotic plants and a mineral water pump room. Due to its location, the town is famous for tourism, hiking and as the departure point for trips. The town has several historical and heritage sites such as the Chapel of Skulls within the Czermna district of Kudowa, an ossuary containing the bones or skeletal remains of thousands. It is one of six of its kind in Europe. Another site is the Basilica of Wambierzyce, nicknamed \\"Silesian Jerusalem\\", and one of the most popular Catholic pilgrimage destinations in Poland. History Zameczek – a palace- styled sanatorium and park Kudowa-Zdrój is one of the oldest spa resorts in Poland and Europe. It is first mentioned in a document by Henry the Elder (1448-1498), son of the Hussite Czech king George of Podebrady. The original name of the village was Lipolitov but in the mid-16th century it was changed to Chudoba, later on Kudoba (Cudoba in the 19th century), Bad Kudowa and into Kudowa-Zdrój in 1945. The oldest part of Kudowa is Czermna, dating back to the 16th century. The first record of a mineral waters in the area comes from 1580 from the chronicles of Louis of Náchod, under the name Cermenske Lazne. In 1625 (or, as some sources say, as early as 1621), G. Aelurius, a Protestant Lutheran monk, wrote in his work \\"Glaciografia\\" about the great taste of the mineral waters from Kudowa. In 1847, Kudowa was visited by 300 patients. In 1850, Adolf Duflos made a chemical analysis of the local waters and claimed they have healing traits. Local doctor J. Jacob helped to establish the notion that Kudowa is a spa that helps heart related diseases, which had a significant impact on the number of people visiting the town. In 1900, the number of people who visited was 4,150. Thanks to development of business organizations, a railway line to Kłodzko (then under the name Glatz) and a local power plant the spa grew, and 8,000 visitors attended its facilities in 1906. In 1891, German-American editor Hermann Raster visited Kudowa-Zdrój to help his failing health. He died there in July of that same year.Illinois Staats-Zeitung, July 25, 1891 In 1920, the Gebrüder Martin und Paul Polka O.H.G. company bought the largest spa resort of the town. Famous visitors include Helmut von Moltke with his family, and Winston Churchill. Also, from 1911 to 1931, Raphael Friedeberg worked as a physician in the Spa.Biography at SPD-Berlin.de Kudowa was part of Bohemia until 1742 when, together with the rest of the county of Kladsko, it passed to Prussia. From 1818 until 1945, it was known as Bad Kudowa, and was part of the Prussian province of Lower Silesia. Between 1871 and 1945 it was part of Germany. In the interbellum, the German administration renamed most district names to erase traces of Slavic origin, only the district of Zakrze (then under the Germanized name Sackisch) retained its name, despite also being of Slavic origin. During World War II, the Germans established and operated a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp for Jewish women in the Zakrze district, as well as other forced labour camps, among the prisoners of which were also Italian prisoners of war.Dorota Sula, Jeńcy włoscy na Dolnym Śląsku w czasie II wojny światowej, \\"Łambinowicki rocznik muzealny\\" Tom 33, Opole, 2010, p. 68 (in Polish) The story of Italian soldier is known. Despite risk Baldan was able to help Jewish women by giving them food, which he in turn received from Poles and Czechs, and he also escaped the camp and hid from Germans with the help of the Czechs. After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II in 1945, most German inhabitants were expelled and Kudowa was repopulated with Polish settlers, most of whom were themselves expelled from former Eastern Poland, annexed by the Soviet Union. After becoming part of Poland it received municipal rights for the first time in its history. As the area was a part of the Czech Corner of Kłodzko Land, a population of ethnic Czechs lived in Kudowa-Zdrój (then Bad Kudowa) before 1945. Small groups of Germans and Czechs continued to live in Kudowa until 1960. A German-speaking school was used from 1951–1960, and a Czech-speaking school was used from 1947-1955 by these small groups. Also Greeks, refugees of the Greek Civil War, settled in the town, as they found employment in the Zakrze textile factory.Mieczysław Wojecki, Ludność grecko- macedońska na Dolnym Śląsku, \\"Śląski Kwartalnik Historyczny Sobótka\\", No. 1/1980, p. 92 (in Polish) Since 1962 Kudowa-Zdrój hosts the annual International Moniuszko Festival, dedicated to the \\"father of Polish national opera\\" Stanisław Moniuszko.

The station is owned by Entercom. The station features the hits of the late 1970s and the 1980s (as well as several hits from the 1990s) and is one of the top performing stations in Phoenix. The focus is 1976 to 1990. Its studios are located in downtown Phoenix, and its transmitter is in South Mountain Park. History Former logo KOOL-FM began programming oldies music in 1971, the first radio station ever to carry the format, as a format brought to the station by Jerry Osborne, who used the air name Dan Coffey. Since the station did not have an oldies library, Osborne supplied all of the music from his own collection. The Dan Coffey Show, which aired on Saturday and Sunday nights, from 6:00 to midnight, immediately became the most popular program on KOOL-FM — so much so that they hired a woman (Pam MacKenzie) whose only job it was to answer the flood of calls and music requests for the Dan Coffey Show. At the time, no other station in the Phoenix market had an oldies format, and Osborne was given the freedom by KOOL-FM (then owned by Gene Autry) to play anything he wanted. Now the door to success was opened and by the end of 1971 the entire station followed. They switched to an all-oldies format. In 1975, Osborne left radio to start his own publishing company. Before he left, he recorded thousands of oldies for the KOOL-FM music library. By about 1986, KOOL was playing a small amount of 1980s music as well. Still, they focused on the music of the late 1960s. The station was co-owned with KOOL/960. In December 1985, Adams Radio Group bought both KOOL-AM/FM from Tom Chauncey and Partners. As Adams radio took ownership, KOOL-AM under the tutelage of GM, Jim Seemiller, changed format to a 1950s/1960s early rock and roll Oldies format on January 7, 1987.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-01-09.pdf The music had a concentration of the early hits but also injected a large dose of Doo-wop. This new format caught on and not only became a rating s success but also syndicated itself 24 hours a day, first radio station to do so. The stations were both owned by Adams Communications, and KOOL format was installed at many of other Adams radio stations. KOOL with its marketing savvy became the leader of Oldies in US. KOOL had its own Radio store, physical shop located in Phoenix with radio paraphernalia, record, music, and other Oldies items and had a tremendous retail operation. At the same time, KOOL opened its own version of a real bar, KOOL CAFE. With the Cafe KOOL did music and live promotions every day of the week. The Cafe became one of Phoenix's hot spots for years. These marketing tactics paid off with the winning of the Marconi award in 1991/92. In late 1995, KOOL-FM began simulcasting on KOOL-AM, which stopped playing \\"older- leaning oldies\\". In 1996, Chancellor acquired KOOL-AM-FM. At that time they acquired several other stations in the market, bringing them to over their ownership limit of 8. They opted to sell KOOL-AM-FM to Salem Media in 1997 and the AM, renamed KPXQ, became a Christian Talk station. In 2002, KPXQ became NewsTalk 960 KKNT focusing on conservative talk radio. KOOL-FM went to Infinity Broadcasting, later to become CBS Radio. The music continued to be about the same until about 1999. At that point more late 1970s songs were added while the pre-1964 oldies were cut back slightly. In 2001, some early 1980s music was added and the pre 1964 oldies were cut to about 2 per hour. By 2003, as was the case as the oldies format continued to evolve, the pre 1964 oldies were eliminated almost completely with a handful of exceptions. More 1980s titles were also added at that point. Today the station, like most oldies outlets, has more of a classic hits format rather than a true oldies format. In February 2008, CBS Radio made major layoffs that sent many longtime personalities packing, including Bill Gardner, John Michaels, Camelback Jack (who will later return), Dave Shannon, and several part-time personalities that had been with the station over the years, including Liz Boyle, Dennis Mitchell and Tony McGraw, aka \\"Skippy\\". With the public release of Arbitron PPM data in July 2009, KOOL-FM continued to be one of the most listened to stations in Phoenix with an airstaff anchored by 30 year market veterans Tom Peake and Steve Goddard along with the return of Camelback Jack at night and radio veteran Jeffrey T. Mason in middays. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. CBS Radio to Merge with Entercom The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. On November 2, 2018, KOOL-FM switched to an all-Christmas format for the first time ever, which lasted until December 26, 2018. On February 25, 2019, the morning show hosts, Maria Knight and Chad Mitchell, moved to 107.9 KMLE-FM and Niko Petrou switched from KMLE to KOOL for the morning show known as the Niko Show.

A \\"highly productive propagandist\\", he was significant in the evolution of early English journalism, and has been strikingly (if hyperbolically) called the \\"press agent\\" of Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell. Early life Nedham was raised by his mother, the innkeeper of The George Inn, Burford, Oxfordshire, after his father's death. His stepfather was the vicar of Burford and teacher at the local school. He was educated at All Souls College of Oxford University. After college he became an usher at the Merchant Taylors' School, and then a clerk at Gray's Inn. He also studied medicine and pharmacology. Civil War = Mercurius Britanicus = Nedham came to prominence in 1643 when he began working on Mercurius Britanicus, a weekly news-book espousing the parliamentary politics of the era, mainly written as a response to the royalist Mercurius Aulicus of John Birkenhead. The Britanicus was originally edited by Captain Thomas Audley, but it has been suggested that Nedham was responsible for the content much earlier, as the style changed little when he took over in May 1644. Britanicus was more overtly polemical and savage than the satirical Aulicus; often refuting the royalist title point for point. Nedham also personalised the debate, declaring that Aulicus was \\"So full of lying and railing, that I think he is afflicted by all the pimp.\\" The publication of Charles I's personal letters which were captured after the Battle of Naseby was a significant propaganda coup for the parliamentary forces. However, when Nedham began to launch attacks on the personality of the king and mock his stammer he drew censure from the House of Lords from members who felt he had gone too far. When Nedham again attacked the king during delicate negotiations with the Scots in May 1646, he was sent to the Fleet prison for two weeks for seditious libel. Upon his release he was banned from publishing but probably authored some of the many anonymous pamphlets around at the time. = Mercurius Pragmaticus = Reportedly Nedham obtained an audience with King Charles I, and gained a royal pardon. Despite his history of writing parliamentary propaganda, he was commissioned to print a Royalist periodical, Mercurius Pragmaticus, starting in September 1647 and continuing for two years. It has been claimed as \\"one of the wittier and less ephemeral\\" of the \\"Cavalier weeklies\\". see p. 595. Pragmaticus opened each issue with a satirical poem directed at various parliamentary figures and is notable for the quality of its sources. Nedham certainly didn't tone down any of the scandalous nature of his personal attacks, referring to Cromwell at various points as \\"Copper- Nose,\\" \\"Nose Almighty,\\" and \\"The Town-bull of Ely.\\" Although he was responsible for the majority of issues, this particular newsbook was notable for the number of counterfeits that it inspired, with as many as 17 different versions available at various times. While some would have been created to trade off the name of the original to make money, there seems to be disagreement as to who owned the \\"true\\" Pragmaticus. It seems that some fellow royalists had never really accepted that Nedham had changed sides in good faith, calling him a \\"turne-coat and inveterate enemy to the late king.\\" In this way they attempted to remove him from the paper. Interregnum = Mercurius Politicus = The triumph of the Parliamentarians in the Civil War led to Nedham's incarceration in Newgate Prison in June 1649; he gained his release in November by switching sides again. The result was perhaps his most significant enterprise, the weekly periodical Mercurius Politicus, which he used as a platform for the Commonwealth regime (Nedham received a government payment of £50 in May 1650, probably to start this venture). This third Nedham weekly began in June 1650, on a light note: \\"Why should not the Commonwealth have a Fool as well as the King had?\\" — but soon settled into a more serious vein as a voice of the republican movement of the day.. He rested the case for the Commonwealth on arguments similar to those of Hobbes: that \\"the Sword is, and ever hath been, the Foundation of all Titles to Government\\", and that it was hardly likely that the Commonwealth's adversaries would ever succeed in their designs. Politicus continued for the next decade, the term of the Commonwealth era, under alternative titles like the Public Intelligence or Public Intelligencer. In 1655 Cromwell rewarded Nedham with an official post, so that Nedham was then perceived as a spokesman for the regime, albeit under the editorial aegis of John Thurloe, spymaster of Cromwell. With the royalist faction suppressed or in exile abroad, Nedham turned away from his previous scurrilous reporting and aimed to educate his readers in political principles of humanism and republicanism. As the early radicalism of the Commonwealth began to wane, the revolutionary ideas expressed in Politicus also softened, with a greater emphasis on the merit of a stable state. This did not mean that he did not on occasion criticise some of the conservative and authoritarian aspects of Cromwell's Protectorate and, like others, called for a return to more republican ideals. The newspaper was widely read in England and Europe amongst exiles and Europeans alike. Another significant innovation was the inclusion of regular advertising. Nedham was associated with a set of influential republican writers of his generation, a circle that included Algernon Sidney, Henry Nevile, Thomas Chaloner, Henry MartenSusan Wiseman, Drama and Politics in the English Civil War, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1998; p. 71. – and John Milton. Milton, as a secretary to the Council of State in the early 1650s, would have overseen Nedham's publishing activity; later, the two men reportedly became personal friends.. Nedham was notable as an advocate of the commercial interests of emerging capitalism in preference to the pillars of the older order. In 1652, he wrote that commercial interest \\"is the true zenith of every state and person...though clothed never so much with the specious disguise of religion, justice and necessity\\".The Case Stated Between England and the United Provinces; quoted in: Consistent with this outlook, Nedham translated John Selden's Mare Clausum (1636) as Of the Dominion or Ownership of the Sea (1652). Restoration Nedham predicted and wrote pamphlets agitating against the restoration of the monarchy and when the king returned he went into hiding, possibly in Holland, but was able to return to England after obtaining a pardon (allegedly purchased with a bribe). Nedham helped his case by re-printing some poems, written in Mercurius Pragmaticus, while supporting Charles I during the late 1640s. He retired from political pamphleteering and worked as a doctor, although he did not entirely avoid publishing, producing two pamphlets on education and medicine.http://eebo.chadwyck.com/search/full_rec?SOURCE=config.cfg&ACTION;=ByID&ID;=11765792 One final foray into the field of political writings came in the mid-1670s when he wrote several pamphlets attacking the Earl of Shaftesbury. The motive for these seems to have been simply money; but he used the occasion to renew his attacks on Presbyterianism, and his final pamphlet before his death in 1678, a call for war against the French, was probably sincere.http://eebo.chadwyck.com/search/full_rec?SOURCE=config.cfg&ACTION;=ByID&ID;=12938806  Style  Nedham's particular style and philosophy can be summarised by his proposal for Mercurius Politicus in 1650: > the design of this pamphlet being to undeceive the people, it must be > written in a jocular way, or else it will never be cried up: for those > truths which the multitude regard not in a serious dress, being represented > in pleasing popular airs, make music to the common sense, and charm the > fancy, which ever sways the sceptre in vulgar judgement, much more than > reason. Nedham used mockery, satire and a biting wit to attack his enemies and generate as much controversy as possible. He believed that a popular audience needed to have humour in addition to the more serious business of news. Propaganda would only be effective with a large circulation. He often invokes The Roman Republic as an ideal model for a government without a monarch. Later, he would also use the self-interest theories of Henri, Duke of Rohan and Machiavelli to compare the motivations for each side's actions and predicting the ensuing political climate. He pioneered this kind of analysis of an ongoing event and used it to determine his own stance Character assessment Nedham's political reversals were depicted as dishonest; but he seems to have regarded religious toleration, usually advocated by the king's party, as the best way to cure the political problems of the times. Presbyterianism, and the Scots in general, he attacked at almost every opportunity. . His writing continued to be influential among the Whigs.Hill, Christopher, The Experience of Defeat (1984), London: Faber and Faber, p20 In the 18th century, Nedham's theories of republicanism were severely criticised by American Founding Father John Adams in the third volume of his A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America (1787–88). In the next century, Nedham's name was used as a pseudonym by other republican political writers; both John Adams and Josiah Quincy Jr. published pieces signed \\"Marchmont Nedham\\" in the early 1770s. Nedham's later reputation was coloured by the apparent cynicism and opportunism of his wavering allegiances, and by hostility towards his republicanism from subsequent generations of English critics. Yet even some hostile critics have conceded his literary talent and his influence. Sympathetic modern commentator Paul Rahe has called Nedham \\"the world's first great journalist\\".

He walked on to University of Nebraska-Lincoln after playing at Pius X High School in Lincoln. He won back-to-back National Championships with the Cornhuskers in 1994 and 1995 playing left tackle and performing all the long snapping duties. He was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the 3rd round (72nd overall) of the 1997 NFL Draft. Raider center From 1997 to 2003, Treu was the reserve center behind Barret Robbins, but when Robbins was injured during the 2001 NFL season, Treu capably filled his place during 14 games. Oakland scored 399 points (24.9 points/game), 4th of 31 teams in the NFL and won the AFC west for the second year in a row. In the 2001–02 NFL playoffs, the offensive line, composed of Treu, Steve Wisniewski and Frank Middleton at guard, Barry Sims and Lincoln Kennedy at tackle, pulverized the New York Jets's defense with 215 yards on the ground and 287 yards in the air in a wild card game, but lost to the New England Patriots in the divisional round, the infamous (from Oakland's viewpoint) Tuck rule game when Tom Brady was judged not to have fumbled. Despite Treu's success, Robbins regained his starting position the following year, up to the day before Super Bowl XXXVII, when reported missing, then found in a manic state. Treu started Super Bowl XXXVII in his place, but the Raiders had little success against a very strong Tampa Bay Buccaneers defense. Robbins regained his starting position during the 2003 NFL season, then was released after testing positive for steroid use. During the 2004 NFL season, Treu became the 6th starting center in Raider history, starting all 16 games, but then started only 10 the following year, replaced by Jake Grove who handled the starting duties for the Raiders with 5–11 and 4–12 won-lost records. In his final year, 2006, he became the reserve center again after Grove replaced him. In November 2006, Treu suffered a ruptured quadriceps tendon against the San Diego Chargers and went on injured reserve. After a 10-season professional career, Treu retired in July 2007.
