In 1907, she was transferred to Alaska.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 48, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 Construction Altona was built in 1890, at Portland, Oregon. She was a sternwheeler driven by twin-single single cylinder horizontally mounted steam engines. She was built for the Graham steamboat line, formally called the Oregon City Transportation Company, but also known as the \\"Yellow Stack Line\\". All the steamers of the line had names that ended in -ona: Latona, Ramona, Altona, Leona, Pomona, Oregona, and Grahamona. Operations on Willamette River Altona ran the Willamette River as far as Corvallis, Oregon. In 1899 the vessel was rebuilt at Portland by David Stephenson and enlarged from 201 to 329 tons and from to On December 23, 1902, Altona was involved in a collision with the steamer Modoc, which occurred as follows according to the report of the Steamboat Inspection Service: Operations on the Yamhill River McMinnville, which would have required use of the Yamhill lock. In November 1901, Altona ran three times weekly from Portland to McMinnville, Oregon. On January 6, 1902, the Oregon City Transportation Company, also known as the \\"Yellow Stack Line\\" advertised regular service, on the Altona from Portland to McMinnville. Altona was scheduled to depart from Portland to McMinnville at 7:00 a.m. every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, from the company's dock at the foot of Taylor Street in Portland. On January 8, 1902, the water in the Yamhill River had risen too high to permit navigation through the recently completed Yamhill River lock and dam near Lafayette, Oregon. The sternwheel steamer Altona which had just resumed the run from Portland to McMinnville after a hiatus of about three weeks, was forced to proceed no further than Dayton on the Yamhill River. The previous suspension of service by Altona had been due to lack of business. With no steamer service, the merchants of Dayton and McMinnville began considering building their own steamer. Captain Graham, of the Oregon City Transportation Company, the owner of Altona, conferred with the merchants and explained his position. The merchants agrees that they would provide sufficient business and Captain Graham agreed to keep Altona on the McMinnville run. However, in 1902, despite the agreement of the merchants to patronize the steamers, the Oregon City Transportation Company withdrew their steamers permanently from service above Dayton. This was said by the company to have been because the difficulties in predicting when the lock would be open during the winter months made it impossible to build up business. Although efforts were made later to establish steamboat service to McMinnville, this withdrawal by the Oregon City Transportation Company marked the end of regular commercial steamboat use of the lock, even though it was to help establish that service that the lock had been built and completed just two years before.

It is a competitive contract procurement process whereby consulting firms submit qualifications to a procuring entity (owner) who evaluates and selects the most qualified firm, and then negotiates the project scope of work, schedule, budget, and consultant fee. Crucially, under a QBS procurement, the cost of the work (price) is not considered when making the initial selection of the best or most appropriate provider of the professional services required. Fees for services will be negotiated, however, following selection and before contracting. Many states in the US have adopted their own versions of the Brooks Act, commonly referred to as \\"Little Brooks Acts\\" or \\"mini-Brooks Acts.\\" For example, Georgia has adopted QBS as appropriate under its state law. Practical application in Georgia state construction procurements has extended the use of QBS into several areas of professional construction services other than architecture, engineering, land surveying, and landscape architecture. These areas have included project and program management, construction management at-risk (CM/GC), design-build, and building commissioning. Other states have adopted varying interpretations. Public owners have developed policies and procedures for Qualifications-Based Selection to govern procurements in which price is not the determining factor in selection. Price will be taken into consideration under QBS but not for the purposes of the public owner's determination of the most suitable and qualified provider of construction services.  Impetus of QBS  Qualifications-Based Selection was developed because public owners lacked procurement tools for services for which price competition made no sense. For example, creative services cannot be fairly priced before the creative process has taken place. An architect can hardly \\"hard bid\\" (submit a firm price for) a project when part of the cost to the architectural firm (and therefore its needs for compensation) will be determined later in the process of discovery of the owner's needs and intentions. Further, lowest cost is widely recognized as the poorest criterion for service selection when quality and professional creativity are sought. An apt analogy from outside of the construction arena often cited is in the area of medical care: Nobody willingly chooses a surgeon based upon a doctor's willingness to perform an operation most cheaply. Whereas private owners can use common sense to procure services based upon an evaluation of sources of greatest delivery of value, public owners, under political scrutiny, have been bound to the presumed objectivity of selections based on lowest price, even if a realistic price could not be determined. Such situations have led to unintended consequences, including poor service and quality, excessive and expensive change orders, and litigation over disputes. Adapting to political reality, known abuses, tight budgets, and increasing expectations on the part of taxpayers for quality with integrity, the public owner has developed selection procedures consciously intended to enhance the probability of value while guarding against unfairness and abuse. Crucial to QBS is the methodology and documentation the public owner uses to ensure competition without consideration of price. An essential element is the use of a selection committee, comprising a number of knowledgeable people of unquestioned integrity, to make the evaluations. The selection committee is charged by the owner with fairly evaluating the qualifications and, often, the ideas for project execution offered by competing firms.  Typical QBS process  Under QBS, the owner would publicly advertise a project and describe it in significant detail in a published \\"Request for Qualifications\\" (RFQ). The RFQ should contain selection criteria explicitly in order for firms to judge the likelihood of being selected. The owner would invite firms to submit their qualifications for evaluation by the selection committee, which must then rank-order the firms using the published selection criteria in making their evaluations. Commonly, the initial evaluation of qualifications submittals will lead to a shortlist of three to five firms that the selection committee judges to be well qualified to perform the work. Through an additional \\"Request for Proposals\\" (RFP), these shortlisted firms may be invited to submit more detailed ideas about the specific project at hand. The selection committee would also evaluate responses to the RFP, and often invite firms to interview in person. Ultimately, the selection committee will provide the owner with a final rank ordering of the shortlisted firms. The owner would then invite the top-ranked firm to enter into negotiations to establish compensation and other contractual terms. If negotiations are not successful and the parties cannot agree to a contract, the owner would dismiss the top- ranked firm and invite the second-ranked firm to negotiate, and so on until a contract is concluded.  Electronic Submittal Process  Until recently the evaluations of qualifications submittals was a completely manual process. This meant that each firm submitting on specific projects would typically need to include multiple copies of the requested items for each selection committee member as well as a copy that would remain on file with the agency. With the release of GSA's Standard Form (SF) 330 in 2004, agencies now have the capability to request that a submittal be performed in an entirely paperless environment with the use of an Electronic Submittal Process (ESP). Beyond a simple document management system, a true ESP will extract essential information from submitted items, maintain lists of projects and specific evaluation criteria, and provide tools for committees to objectively compare, score and rank firms in an efficient manner. Specific tools, like GovernmentForms.manager¬≠‚Ñ¢, are available from private sector vendors like Enlightened Software, Inc.

Clarkson claimed that Jaguars \\"ease the burden of travel\\" and devised a test for the Jaguar XJ to see how far he could drive one before he got bored. He ran out of country before he got bored. Series Two, Episode Four *Lap of the M25 / Test: fuel economy. Clarkson drove a lap of the M25 in a diesel Volkswagen Lupo, while another driver used the petrol version to see which would achieve greater fuel efficiency. Clarkson was allowed to spend any money he saved over the petrol version on a gift at South Mimms services. He chose a small gold model of a cockerel, which made a reappearance in later series as \\"The Golden Cock\\"‚Äîthe award given to the presenter who'd made the most embarrassing mistake of the year. Series Three, Episode One *Toyota Hilux destruction / Test: toughness. Clarkson and May used various methods in an attempt to destroy a 1988 Toyota Hilux, which included driving it into a tree which belonged to Churchill Parish, Somerset. The villagers presumed that the damage had been accidental or vandalism had occurred until the Top Gear episode was broadcast. After the BBC was contacted, the director of Top Gear admitted guilt and the broadcaster paid compensation. Other tests on the Hilux included leaving it out in the ocean, slamming it with a wrecking ball, setting the cabin on fire and finally having it hoisted to the roof of a tower-block that was subsequently blown up. The heavily damaged (but still driveable) Hilux used to stand on a plinth in the Top Gear studio. Series Three, Episodes Five & Six *Helicopter gunship evasion / Test: handling. Clarkson tried to avoid being caught in missile lock from a Westland WAH-64D Apache attack helicopter while driving a Lotus Exige. Series Four, Episode One *London to Edinburgh and back again on a single tank of fuel / Test: fuel economy. Clarkson attempted to drive a 4.0 V8 diesel Audi A8 on a single tank of fuel. Series Four, Episode Four *Minicab road testing / Test: toughness and practicality. Hammond and May worked as minicab drivers in order to subject a Renault Scenic and Ford C-MAX to a year's worth of hard abuse in one evening. Series Four, Episode Seven *Off-road up a mountain / Test: off- road ability. Clarkson tried to drive a Land Rover Discovery from the beach to the top of Cnoc an Fhreiceadain in Scotland, completely off-road. It was heavily criticised by environmentalists for the damage done by the vehicle's tyres. This stunt was memorable in that Clarkson left the mountain by helicopter with the Discovery's keys in his pocket, so delaying its removal from the hill. Series Five, Episode Three *24 hours in a car / Test: comfort. Hammond and May spent 24 hours in a Smart Forfour to assess the marketing claim that the car is \\"designed like a lounge.\\" Series Five, Episode Four *Tank evasion / Test: off-road ability. Clarkson discovered whether a Challenger 2 tank could lock its main cannon on to a Range Rover Sport. Series Six, Episode One *Car Football / Test: toughness and handling. Hammond and May, along with a selection of professional drivers, played a football match using Toyota Aygos. Series Six, Episode One *Sniper evasion / Test: handling. Clarkson drove around a deserted village (British Army training facility at STANTA, Norfolk) in a Mercedes-Benz SLK55 AMG and a 2005 Porsche Boxster S, trying to evade snipers of the Irish Guards. Series Six, Episode Five *Road Test Russian Roulette / Test: random road testing. Hammond and May worked as ScooterMen in order to road-test as many randomly selected cars as possible‚Äîthe catches being that they wouldn't know what they'd be road- testing, and that they had to do it in the presence of the cars' owners. Series Six, Episode Nine *Supercars / Superbridge / Test: illustrate the point of supercars. The trio took three supercars (a Ford GT, a Ferrari F430 Spider and a Pagani Zonda S) on a road trip to the recently opened Millau Viaduct via Paris. Series Seven, Episode Three *Car Ice Hockey / Test: toughness and handling. Hammond and May, along with a selection of professional drivers, played an ice hockey match using Suzuki Swifts, while Clarkson acted as referee. Winter Olympics Special *Horse racing camera platform / Test: smooth ride. Clarkson reviewed the Citro√´n C6 and put it to work as a mobile camera platform covering a horse race. Series Eight, Episode Five *Car Football 2 / Test: toughness and handling. Hammond and May, along with a selection of professional drivers, staged another football match using Toyota Aygos against a new contender, the Volkswagen Fox. Series Eight, Episode Five *VIP chauffeur / Test: luxury. In Japan, May conducted road tests of the Mitsuoka Orochi and Galue, and used the Galue to chauffeur a Sumo wrestler and his manager to a tournament as a way to test if the car is \\"Japan's Rolls-Royce.\\" Series Eleven, Episode Six *Best Hot Hatchback for doing various things in / Test: Fun and practicality. In order to determine which hot hatchback was the best, the trio were told to bring one to the Italian city of Lucca. Clarkson brought a Citro√´n DS3 Racing, May a 2010 Renaultsport Clio Cup and Hammond a 2011 Fiat 500 Abarth. Series Seventeen, Episode Two *GT car on a WRC stage / Test: 4WD system. May takes a Bentley Continental GT to a Welsh stage of the World Rally Championship, and acts as Kris Meeke's co-driver. Series Nineteen, Episode One *Car and tablecloth / Test: Speed. The Stig tries to use a Nissan GT-R to pull a tablecloth off a table without smashing any of the ornaments and cutlery. Series Twenty-One, Episode Four How hard can it be? A recurring feature on Top Gear involves the hosts undertaking a number of bizarre challenges involving cars. The segments involving the challenges are usually preceded by Jeremy Clarkson, though sometimes Richard or James, asking the audience and viewers: \\"How hard can it be?\\" = Lap the N√ºrburgring in less than 10 minutes... in a diesel= Series Five, Episode Five Clarkson took a diesel Jaguar S-Type to the N√ºrburgring with the aim of completing a lap in less than 10 minutes. Clarkson was being coached by Sabine Schmitz, a noted German racer. After consecutive unsuccessful tries, Clarkson managed to lap the N√ºrburgring in 9 minutes and 59 seconds, with Clarkson celebrating enthusiastically and showing the results proudly to his coach. Schmitz was still unimpressed, proclaiming that she could do that time in a van, and then lapped the Jaguar 47 seconds faster than Clarkson's time. = Lap the N√ºrburgring in less than 9 minutes and 59 seconds... in a van= Series Six, Episode Seven To celebrate the Ford Transit's 40th birthday, Hammond went to the N√ºrburgring to see if Clarkson's mentor from the previous N√ºrburgring challenge, Sabine Schmitz, could live up to her claim and do a lap in a diesel 2005 Ford Transit van in less than 9 minutes and 59 seconds. Despite minor aerodynamic modifications and weight-saving made to the van - removal of the passenger seat, spare tyre, tools, windscreen wipers, Hammond himself - and using a Dodge Viper driving in front allowing the Transit to slipstream behind it, Schmitz was unable to do a lap time of less than 10 minutes, achieving a lap time of 10 minutes and 8 seconds. = Convertible people carrier= Series Eight, Episode One The presenters were set the task of building a convertible people carrier. They succeeded in removing the roof from a 1996 Renault Espace and replaced it with a canvas fold-down top. The resulting vehicle was able to travel at 100 mph without losing its roof, and was driven through an animal park without any incident. However, a trip through a car wash resulted in the brand-new million-pound wash facility catching fire. = Present a drive time radio show= Series Eight, Episode Two The presenters tried to host a drive time radio show on BBC Southern Counties Radio in Brighton, but ended up with many complaints from the listeners. This was mainly because Clarkson's travel bulletins focussed on hounding motorists he could see dawdling on CCTV, rather than issuing the more normal information on the location of problem areas caused by such people and how to avoid them. = Amphibious vehicles= Series Eight, Episode Three Jeremy Clarkson's amphibious Toybota pickup. The presenters were set the challenge of building amphibious cars, and using them to get to‚Äîand across‚Äîa two-mile-wide reservoir. Hammond transformed a 1983 Volkswagen camper van into a narrowboat-style \\"damper van;\\" Clarkson attached an outboard motor to a modified 1989 Toyota Hilux pick-up truck, which he dubbed the \\"Toybota\\". May fitted a 1962 Triumph Herald with a mast and sails. This caused clearance problems on the road and he had to take an alternative route when on land due to a \\"low bridge.\\" Hammond's dampervan was very heavy and slow on the road, and quickly sank after entering the water. Both the Herald and Hilux performed well in the water, however the Herald was slow due to the sails. Clarkson drove the Hilux at high speeds in the water and was making good progress, however he rolled it over while trying to enter the pier. May was eventually voted the winner by the studio audience. Winner: May After the show, Clarkson and May insisted that their own cars were best; Clarkson said the Toybota was best because it would have reached the finish if it didn't roll over at the last moment in a good time, but James hit back, saying that it wasn't a race, and the Toybota rolled over anyway. = Car interior design= Series Eight, Episode Four Clarkson bought a 1996 Mercedes- Benz S280 and designed his perfect interior based upon his imagined perfect house. The car, dubbed \\"Anne Hathaway's Cottage\\", featured a wood-burning stove, kitchen chairs, a flagstone floor, and wood with a cement base (weighing approximately two tons), even plastering the door trim. James May and Richard Hammond then tested the car. A lack of seat belts and unsecured seats meant they tumbled around inside the car. Eventually, with May holding Hammond's seat, a 0‚Äì60 time of 35.4 seconds was established. = Improve your lap time by 20 seconds= Series Eight, Episode Five Sir Jackie Stewart claimed that he could cut down any of the presenters' driving time around a race circuit by 20 seconds, so James took him up on the offer and they used a TVR Tuscan at Oulton Park. = Caravan holiday= Series Eight, Episode Six Clarkson, May and Hammond went on a caravan holiday in Dorset to try to find out more about caravanning, bringing along an Elddis Shamal XL as their caravan. The trio unsuccessfully tried to have fun and caused numerous traffic jams. May crashed the caravan into a bollard. Hammond and the show's pet labradoodle, Top Gear dog were kidnapped by an elderly female fan. Clarkson \\"accidentally\\" set the caravan and its neighbour on fire while trying to cook chips. = Kit car race= Series Eight, Episode Seven The presenters, based at Knockhill Racing Circuit in Fife, were set the task of building a Caterham Seven Kit car from scratch and drive past the starting line, faster than the time it would take The Stig to reach the track from the Caterham showroom in Caterham using a pre-built Caterham Seven Kit car. The presenters won the challenge because The Stig was stopped by the traffic police just 3 miles from the finish. (The Stig \\"exercised his right to remain silent,\\" and was taken into custody.) =Roadies van challenge= Series Eight, Episode Eight The team decided to test some vans by being roadies for The Who. May picked a 2005 Renault Master, Hammond chose a 2006 Ford Transit, and Clarkson selected a 2006 Volkswagen T30 TDI 174 Sportline. After The Who's concert at Hyde Park, Clarkson, Hammond and May took some of their equipment 90 miles to the site of their next show. They concluded that the cheapest van for the task at hand should always be used. Subsequently, Clarkson admitted that the feature was not the greatest of ideas. This feature was directly followed by the Man with a van cheap car challenge. = Road works in 24 hours= Series Nine, Episode One The presenters decided to speed up the road works on the D5481 near Bidford in Warwickshire. According to the County Council, it would take an entire week, but the Top Gear team achieved it in just one day (although they did have 32 men working with them). According to the film, Clarkson prevented them from having proper meal breaks and instead fed them on the berries growing on the bushes by the side of the road. However, for tea, Hammond provided fish and chips for all the workmen. The team worked through the entire day and night to get the job done. Jeremy decided to motivate the men by putting on Margaret Thatcher speeches on a loudspeaker and saying \\"The sooner you're done, the sooner I'll turn her off.\\" James May took away the loudspeaker and had a road-roller crush it. = Reliant Robin Space Shuttle= Series Nine, Episode Four Hammond and May tried to convert a 1992 Reliant Robin into a space shuttle. They were given 12 days to build it and help from the United Kingdom Rocketry Association. Eight tonnes of thrust was required to launch the Robin‚Äîthe largest non-commercial rocket launch undertaken in Europe. The Reliant Robin took off; everything seemed to be working until a release bolt attaching the Robin to the fuel tank failed to detach. The combined result spiraled out of control and crashed on a nearby hillside. = Growing petrol using tractors= Series Nine, Episode Five The presenters decided to grow their own environmentally friendly petrol by planting rapeseed in a field. For this challenge, each presenter needed to research and acquire a tractor. Each presenter then took part in a series of challenges at the airfield, including a \\"drag race,\\" in which they raced each other while dragging something found around the airfield. In the end, it was discovered May had ordered the wrong type of seed, so they ended up with 500 gallons of Biodiesel which was later used for the Britcar 24-hour endurance race. = Stretch limos= Series Nine, Episode Six The presenters were sent out to buy normal cars that are available in Britain, then turn them into stretch limousines. Once the presenters had built their limos, they had to chauffeur three celebrities across London to the Brit Awards. Hammond chauffeured Jamelia in a 1996 MG F \\"Sports Limo,\\" arriving with a stuck throttle and having to assist her exit with a pool ladder. Clarkson chauffeured Chris Moyles using a greatly lengthened, dual rear axle 1993 Fiat Panda, which as originally engineered had not been road legal, and arriving with only half a car after it split in two before reaching its destination.He had been required to shorten it to comply with the maximum length of an unarticulated car allowed on a British road, and subsequently the join in the middle made out of masking tape failed. James May attempted to chauffeur Lemar in the \\"Salfa Romeaab\\" (a cross between the front ends of a 1996 Alfa Romeo 164 and a 1994 Saab 9000); Lemar ultimately got frustrated and got out of the car after May repeatedly got lost. Clarkson claimed victory as he got one photograph of his celebrity published in a newspaper. However, as his co-presenters pointed out, the image appeared in Clarkson's own newspaper column in The Sun (to which he responded that they both also have newspaper columns that they could have used). =Polar race special= Polar Challenge Special In April‚ÄìMay 2007, Clarkson and May teamed up to race Hammond from Resolute, Nunavut to the North Magnetic Pole, taking the route set out in the Polar Challenge. The terrain in between is some of the toughest in the world‚Äîa mix of mountainous land masses and jagged sea ice where temperatures can drop to ‚àí65 degrees Celsius (‚àí85 degrees Fahrenheit). Jeremy and James used a specially adapted Toyota Hilux pick-up truck, while Richard used a sled pulled by a team of ten Canadian Inuit dogs, driven by American explorer Matty McNair. In the end the truck won, although the sled overtook them at one point while they were crossing the first of two fields of ice boulders. The Hilux used by the camera crew would later appear in Series fifteen, Episode One, modified to be able to drive near Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano in Iceland to obtain a lava rock. = Amphibious cars: redux= Series Ten, Episode Two James May's amphibious Triumph Herald. The presenters made a second attempt to use amphibious cars‚Äîthis time to cross the English Channel. All three presenters modified their original designs: Clarkson created an amphibious 1996 Nissan pickup truck; Hammond used a \\"new\\" 1981 Volkswagen Transporter; May upgraded and used the same 1962 Triumph Herald he had used in the original challenge. May was unable to sail the Herald out of the harbour, sinking twice and damaging the vehicle beyond repair. Hammond's Transporter worked well initially, but the engine was damaged in rough seas, necessitating the use of an outboard engine. It eventually flooded and sank. Clarkson won, while carrying his co-presenters, in his \\"Nissank\\" on the trip. The presenters had aimed for Calais, but missed, finishing in Sangatte. They also attempted (and failed) to break the record set by Richard Branson for the fastest crossing of the Channel in an amphibious vehicle. Winner: Clarkson = Driving a Formula 1 car= Series Ten, Episode Eight Hammond sets out to complete two laps around Stowe Circuit at Silverstone driving the Renault R25 Formula One car, which took both the driver's (with Fernando Alonso) and constructor's championship titles in the 2005 Formula One season. = Britcar 24-hour endurance race= Series Ten, Episode Nine Richard Hammond driving Top Gears diesel BMW 330d in the Britcar 24 Hours. In the previous series, the presenters planted their own biofuel crop, which was rapeseed. However, due to an ordering blunder made by James May they accidentally made 500 gallons worth of biodiesel. In order to dispose of it, they took part in the Britcar 24-hour endurance race at Silverstone Circuit using a modified 2003 BMW 330d. Arriving at the event, the team discovered that it was not an event for novices, as they had expected, but it was a fully professional endurance race and the team would be competing alongside actual 200 mph supercars. However, with help from The Stig, they eventually finished third in class and 39th overall, despite a fuel pump failure, only just making the start, several fuel leaks, going off the track many times, and a Mosler crashing into Hammond. = Renault Avantime tuning challenge= Series Twelve, Episode Three The presenters were challenged to make an ordinary car lap the track as fast as a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X, which has a time of 1 minute 28 seconds, using only the price difference from that ordinary car to a used Lancer Evo as their budget. They did not know what car they would have to work with. Despite May's prediction of a Hyundai Accent 3-cylinder diesel, the car was revealed to be a 2002 Renault Avantime. Notwithstanding various modifications‚Äîincluding wheels, tyres, brakes, the exhaust of an unknown TVR, the rear wing from a Super Aguri F1 car (which was later taken off), a wooden front splitter (which caught fire)‚Äîthe presenters were unable to beat the Evo's time. They did improve on the original time by 7.1 seconds, but this was achieved mostly through a combination of swapping out the heavy, electrically heated seats that came with the Avantime for much lighter carbon fibre racing seats, and May servicing the engine to get it nearer its originally rated power. The presenters noted that the other modifications generally didn't help, and some even made the car slower. The only modifications that did work properly cost little beyond the time, effort and relatively simple equipment used. = From Basel to Blackpool on a single tank of fuel= Series Twelve, Episode Four The presenters were challenged to drive from Basel, Switzerland to Blackpool, England, on a single tank of fuel, in order to switch on the Blackpool Illuminations. Although each presenter chose a different route, Clarkson estimated the distance as approximately 750 miles. Each presenter chose diesel vehicles: Jeremy used a 2007 Jaguar XJ6 Diesel, and in spite of using every feature in the car, and driving uneconomically, completed the journey. He was beaten by Richard Hammond, driving a 2008 Volkswagen Polo BlueMotion. James May, driving a 2008 Subaru Legacy, arrived 40 minutes after Clarkson. = Make a car advertisement= Series Thirteen, Episode Seven James and Jeremy were given the challenge to create a simple, but effective, TV advertisement for the new Volkswagen Scirocco TDi. Several entries were made, including one stating while the Scirocco wasn't fast it was economical, a rehash of a previous Golf ad, and one detailing a funeral (slightly spoiled by Clarkson). All were rejected, leading Clarkson and May to create separate ads. Clarkson won with references to World War II. = Build an electric car= Series Fourteen, Episode Two The Hammerhead Eagle i-Thrust which the presenters built for the show The presenters were challenged to create their own electric car that would rival the G-Wiz. The first car, nicknamed \\"Geoff\\", was put through its paces in the city of Oxford, before being re-built as the Hammerhead-i Eagle Thrust. The Hammerhead underwent a number of safety tests at the Motor Industry Research Association, with the Top Gear trio attempting to fool the examiners by using simple camera trickery. It was then reviewed by Autocar magazine, with the team disappointed by the review, while making a reference to OFCOM, the telecommunications regulator. =Build a snowplough= Series Sixteen, Episode Five Due to the problems Britain suffered during the previous winter with snow, and local authorities not having the money to spend on road clearing equipment, the presenters came up with the idea of the Snowbine Harvester to save money, working on the theory combine harvesters were sitting idle during winter months so were readily available with a cheap conversion kit. The team fitted a snowplough to the front of a used Claas Dominator. It was also converted to a gritter using the grain chute, capable of blasting grit through the windows of nearby cars. A flamethrower was fitted at the rear, operated by Jeremy, and a Bovril boiler in the cab for James to counter the lack of heating. During testing in Norway, the team blasted grit through a house window, set fire to a man and ran into a car hidden by snow. They then successfully ploughed a road that had not previously been ploughed that winter. The team admitted that this was an unusual challenge in that they were ultimately \\"ambitious and successful\\" - contrary to the usual challenge results.Discussion upon arrival: *Clarkson: \\"And so there we are - for once in our wretched lives on this programme we'd actually done what we set out to do.\\" *Clarkson: \\"You know what - we've been ambitious and brilliant, and it's all due to the Dominator.\\" *Hammond: \\"Successful!\\" = Build a train= Series Seventeen, Episode Four The presenters believed that train travel in the UK is too expensive, and the main reason is that trains are expensive to build. They first of all converted a 1990 5.3 V12 Jaguar XJS to work on the railway, before building carriages from old caravans for the varying classes of passenger (first, second, \\"scum\\") and a Buffet car using wheels from Permanent Way trollies. The Jaguar was unable to pull the four \\"carriages\\" due to their weight, and the Jaguar's rear-wheel-drive. The presenters split into two teams, with Clarkson taking the Jaguar and promising to build a \\"Train GTI\\", later referred to as the \\"TGV12\\", and Hammond and May converting a four-wheel- drive 2001 Audi S8 to pull the existing carriages. The presenters (with their respective creations) then raced from \\"near Leicester\\" (Leicester North) to \\"near Loughborough\\" (Loughborough Central) on the Great Central Railway with a number of railway experts as passengers. Clarkson won the race despite having been caught behind Hammond and May at times and almost colliding with No. 10119 Margaret Ethel-Thomas Alfred Naylor after attempting to 'overtake' the Caravan Train. Meanwhile, the Buffet car on Hammond's and May's train had caught fire, and after stopping short of Loughbourough, the \\"scum class\\" carriage was hit (and destroyed) by passing diesel locomotive D123 Leicestershire and Derbyshire Yeomanry. = Off-road mobility scooters= Series Eighteen, Episode Four The presenters are tasked with creating their own off-road mobility scooters for rambling in the Welsh countryside. Clarkson builds an eight-wheeler with two engines from two electric scooters, with lawnmower wheels. May makes an electric wheelchair and Hammond creates his machine from a mobility trike and a petrol powered builders' wheelbarrow, with a single wheel at the front and crawler tracks at the back The task ends with a race in the countryside against three wounded soldiers. Only Hammond manages to finish the race, with Clarkson's scooter falling down a hill into a set of trees, and May aborting the mission and getting stuck outside a pub near Crickhowell. = Convertible supercars for all weather= Series Twenty Four, Episode Two Chris and Matt are tasked with finding the perfect convertible supercar for all weather. Matt brought a Lamborghini Huracan Spyder and Chris brought a Porsche 911 Turbo S convertible. Both are told to report in Las Vegas for a series of challenges along a 400-mile road trip from Las Vegas to the Sierra Nevada mountains. The first challenge, named \\"Spring\\", was held at Spring Mountain Raceway, where they have to complete a lap of the track with the roof down at the beginning and finish with the roof up. Along the way, a firetruck is prepared to simulate the effects of a spring rain. Next, there was the second challenge named \\"Summer\\", where they have to switch cars (written as \\"take a vacation from your car\\", in keeping with the summer vacation spirit) and drive across the Death Valley. Before the third challenge arrived, both have to spend the night at Darwin, California. The following day, the third challenge, named \\"Fall\\" arrived, where they have to freewheel down a section of the Sierra Nevada mountain road, where it's slippery. As they climbed higher into the mountains, the final challenge arrived at Mammoth Mountain where they have to race across the snowy mountain. On the final challenge, Matt initially made good progress as Chris' Porsche got temporarily stuck, but Chris later caught up as the Lamborghini's low ground clearance made Matt temporarily stuck before he chained the Lamborghini's rear tyres. Despite this Chris wins the race narrowly. = Building the world's fastest tractor= Series Twenty Five, Episode Five In an effort to fix the tractor's slow speed, Matt and Chris headed to the \\"Top Gear Agricultural Technology Centre\\", where Matt builds a custom tractor with a 500 hp Chevrolet V8 engine, dubbed the \\"Track-tor\\". To prove the tractor's performance credentials, Matt aimed for 81 mph in order to beat a previous world speed record set in Finland. Matt did reach 81 mph, however, in the hands of The Stig, it reached 87 mph, setting a new world record. Next, they headed to a farm to see if the Track-tor is as useful as other tractors, specifically the New Holland T7 tractor, driven by Robert Neill, winner of the 2017 Farmer of the Year. The first test was hedge cutting, where the Track-tor's power overwhelmed the presenters as it frequently did wheelies and killing the scarecrow in the process. The next test was ploughing, where the Track-tor did a rather poor job at it. The final challenge was to harvest vegetables from the farm and transport it to the freezer section of a local village market 8 miles away in under 23 minutes, assisted by The Stig. The presenters managed to do so with only ten seconds to spare. = Building the ultimate family car = Series Twenty Seven, Episode Three Paddy, thinking that he can find the ultimate family car on the cheap, set out to buy a 1995 Daimler hearse for just ¬£1,300. Over at the track, challenges include a \\"last space drag race\\" against Britain's best selling family cars; Chris drives a Volkswagen Touran, while Freddie drives a Kia Sportage (Damon Hill makes an appearance as guest driver in a Citro√´n Berlingo), which the hearse comfortably wins due to its 240 horsepower, 4.0 liter 6-cylinder engine, followed by a boot space challenge to test for practicality, which the hearse won again. A few days later, Chris and Freddie decided to modify the hearse and meet at Tenby. The hearse now sports a 4.0 liter V8 engine from a Lexus LS400, alongside a host of other modifications from full respray to Polestar Blue to amenities such as a ball pit and a \\"naughty step\\". Now dubbed \\"The Overtaker\\", the presenters have to do a family holiday in Wales. First, they head for the local beach, where they have to beat a rival holidaymaker in a Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG estate; Paddy claims he scored a moral victory due to the hearse's cheap price. Next, they go to Walters Arena for their next challenge: a race to the campsite against Land Rover Discovery driven by a family of Stigs, where the hearse tipped over. The next day, the presenters mended the hearse and met at Mendips Raceway for their final challenge: banger racing to test the car's safety, which Paddy insisted on doing, with Chris and Freddie serving as Paddy's outriders; one of the competitors is Sabine Schmitz in a Volvo estate. Despite the harsh treatment the hearse received, its engine still runs by the end of the show, much to Paddy's joy. = Building a capable off-roader for less cost than the new Land Rover Defender= Series Twenty Eight, Episode Two In a bid to beat Land Rover Defender's off-road capabilities with a much lower cost than one (a new Defender costs ¬£70,000), Paddy decided to build an off-road vehicle dubbed the \\"Dirty Rascal\\", a combination of Daihatsu Fourtrak's powertrain atop a Bedford Rascal bodyshell and told to report to the Millbrook Proving Ground, where Chris and Freddie praised the work done to the car and the fact that it only costs ¬£7,000 to build the whole car, amenities included. First, the car is put to the test against two of the cheapest brand new 4x4s available for sale in the UK, the Suzuki Jimny and the Dacia Duster in a timed lap challenge. The Dirty Rascal initially made a good progress, but soon stalled. Next, Paddy heads for Scotland for their next challenge: a 20 kilometer off-road race against a squad of fully-armed former British Special Forces. After getting bogged down thanks to a smoke bomb from the Forces, the Dirty Rascal caught up to the troops by following the nearby river and some gravel tracks; however, the car came just moments later than the Forces. Cheap cars The presenters are given a budget to buy a used car conforming to certain criteria. The budget is typically around ¬£1,500, but it has ranged between ¬£100 and ¬£10,000 depending on the type of car. Once purchased, the presenters compete against each other in a series of tests to establish who has bought the best car. The presenters have no prior knowledge of what the tests will be, although they generally involve: *A long journey used to determine reliability and fuel economy *A lap round a race track, usually by the Stig, to determine performance. In some cases the Stig sets a time in a similar car and the presenters have to beat it. *An inspection to discover what is and isn't working or how much of the car is original *Spending any leftover change from the initial budget on repairing and/or modifying the cars *Selling the cars at the end of the challenge. All three presenters are highly competitive; vandalism and sabotage are commonplace, and any presenter whose car breaks down during a challenge will typically be abandoned to make their own way to the designated destination. Certain challenges since the African Cheap Car Road Trip have had a back-up car made available for any presenter whose car breaks down and cannot be repaired. The back-up vehicle is generally a model that is loathed by all three presenters, or in some other way antagonistic to the current challenge. Due to the controversial nature of some challenges, it is difficult to gauge who has been the most successful so far, but as a rough guide: May and Clarkson have won the most cheap car challenges with seven victories and Hammond has won three. Some challenges remain unclear, however, such as the ¬£10,000 mid-engined Italian supercar challenge, where no presenter actually made it to their destination (although May came the closest to reaching their final destination, Hammond had won all but one of the challenges along the way and was leading on points). The genuine winner of the ¬£1000 police car challenge remains unclear as a result of Hammond eating the final results of Clarkson's Fiat, and declaring himself the winner. The presenter who unofficially won the most challenges was Clarkson, with 10. May won 8 challenges, and Hammond won 6. =¬£100 Car challenge= Series Four, Episode Three The presenters were given ¬£100 to buy a car that was road legal (had current tax and an MOT certificate). This was to prove that a car could be purchased and driven from London to Manchester and back again for less than it would cost to take the train (around ¬£180), including the price of the fuel. Clarkson bought a 1988 Volvo 760 GLE, Hammond bought a 1991 Rover 416GTi, and May bought a 1989 Audi 80 1.8E. The challenge included reliability, fuel economy, stopping time, safety, price, and lap-time testing. May's Audi won most of the challenges, but Clarkson was declared overall winner as he bought the Volvo for ¬£1, awarding him 99 points. Winner: Clarkson =Cheap Porsche challenge= Series Five, Episode Six The presenters were given ¬£1,500 to buy a Porsche. Clarkson bought a 1983 928, Hammond bought a 1980 924, and May bought a 1984 944. The challenge included driving from London to Brighton, fuel economy, using the car in a lonely-hearts column, lap time, selling the car, and using the change from the ¬£1,500 modifying the cars for judging by the Porsche Owners' Club. Clarkson won the challenge (despite bringing the most unreliable of the three cars) when he earned more by breaking up his car and selling it for parts. Winner: Clarkson =Cheap coup√©s that aren't Porsches challenge= Series Six, Episode Two Following the previous challengeClarkson: \\"We proved that you can't buy a Porsche for ¬£1,500.\\" Hammond: \\"Well, not if you actually want to go anywhere that is.\\" the presenters were sent to buy coupes that weren't Porsches for ¬£1,500 and report to Millbrook Proving Ground. Clarkson bought a 1991 Mitsubishi Starion, Hammond purchased a 1983 BMW 635 CSi, and May bought a 1982 Jaguar XJS, which was leaking oil as soon as it arrived. The first challenge was to see if they could exceed 140 mph. May won by reaching 140, though the Jaguar broke down and had to have its oil and water replaced. The Starion, thanks to a modified turbocharger and some accidental weight shedding, achieved 119 mph, beating the BMW's 115 mph. A test of ride comfort was then carried out; each presenter drove their car at 30 mph over a cobbled road with a bowl of water in their lap, losing points for every ounce spilt. The Jaguar won again, and while Hammond's sporty BMW did poorly, Clarkson fared even worse; the Starion's ride was so hard that the manual gearbox was of no consequence. The Stig then set a lap time for each car on the Alpine testing track, where the Starion narrowly beat the BMW. The Jaguar came last and lost its engine oil again. The three presenters were next asked to drive from Millbrook to the QI club in Oxford; points were awarded for the order of arrival, deducted for breakdowns, and fuel economy was measured. May's Jaguar broke down so many times that he eventually gave up, managing just 8 miles per gallon. Clarkson beat Hammond to the club, albeit with poorer fuel consumption. The final challenge was an endurance race - each presenter was allowed to modify their car with the money left over from the original purchase. Hammond fitted a home-made bodykit to the BMW. May tried to paint the Jaguar in British racing green (only to run out of paint) and spent the rest fixing the engine. Clarkson had a more professional paint job, and installed an even more powerful turbo. The outcome was unexpected - while Clarkson's new turbo made the Mitsubishi the fastest car in the entire race, the engine repeatedly overheated and broke down after almost every lap, before one last blow up put him out for good. Hammond's gearbox failed in the final stages of the race, but he still beat May by two laps (although the Jaguar suffered wear during the race, it only broke down once when the brake fluid overheated). Winner: May (Clarkson by agreement)On points, May narrowly beat Hammond in the challenge, but Clarkson then attempted to claim victory by pointing out the Starion had been superior until the endurance race. May and Hammond acknowledged this, saying that the only problem with the Starion had been Clarkson's modifications. So they offered Clarkson the win if he admitted that, 'you're a clot and you ruined your car', which he did. =Italian mid-engined supercars for less than a second-hand Mondeo challenge= Series Seven, Episode Four The presenters were given ¬£10,000 to buy a 1970s supercar, which had to be mid-engined and Italian, and told to report to Bristol. Clarkson bought a 1974 Maserati Merak, (he was told it was an SS model, only to discover during the challenges that it only had a ¬£38 SS badge). Hammond purchased a 1979-built (1983 late-reg) Ferrari 308 GT4, and May found a 1974 Lamborghini Urraco afflicted by electrical problems. Various challenges included a lap of the Castle Combe Circuit, changing the oil and sparkplugs of their cars and driving from Chippenham to a \\"gentlemen's club\\" in Slough on a set amount of fuel. Hammond won most of the challenges, and May's Urraco was a constant source of problems due to its poor electrics - it arrived in Bristol on the back of a tow truck, and broke down on almost every leg of the trip. The Merak began to deteriorate at Castle Combe, where it was revealed to have terrible brakes, and the engine began making worrying noises alongside very poor performance. It was later revealed in a rolling road challenge that it was only producing 80 bhp. Clarkson initially blamed the sound on the tappets, but as the day progressed, May declared that the engine was disintegrating. In the end, none of the cars survived the final journey to the finishing point at Spearmint Rhino. First, the Merak's engine exploded, showering the Urraco in pieces of the wreckage and forcing Clarkson to crash into a hedge, thanks to its brakes not being able to work without a running engine. The Ferrari appeared to run out of fuel 10 miles from Slough, although Hammond later explained that the entire electrical system had failed suddenly. Finally, the Urraco ran out of fuel on the outskirts of Slough, just one mile from the finish, causing a major traffic jam. The presenters therefore unanimously declared that the scores were useless, and Clarkson summarised with \\"yes, you can buy a mid-engined Italian supercar for less than ¬£10,000, but for the love of God, don't!\\" Winner: No one The GT4 used in this challenge was later bought and being repaired by Hammond, only to be damaged again when he was in the Petrolheads, where he was tricked and rammed during a challenge. =Man with a van challenge= Series Eight, Episode Eight As a followup from a previous challenge, and as punishment for the useless reviews of the vans tested, the presenters were given ¬£1,000 to buy a van and face a series of challenges. Clarkson, following Hammond's original strategy of buying a simple van, bought a 1992 Ford Transit, while May chose a 1999 LDV Convoy box van for its considerable storage. Hammond arrived last with a 1994 Suzuki Super Carry, claiming that as it was mid-engined it was essentially a supercar. The tests began with a drag race; Hammond won easily, Clarkson came second, and May last. They then performed a race to see how long it took to load and unload various items (each presenter was given an illegal immigrant). May had little trouble loading his van, but had an uncooperative immigrant. Clarkson, who continually moaned about his aversion to manual labour, simply threw most of his items into the Transit carelessly. He then wrongfooted May by parking just behind the LDV to stop it unloading. Clarkson consequently won, while Hammond, who had fallen far behind due to the comparatively small storage space of the Suzuki, lost badly. The third challenge was tailgating a passenger car as closely as possible. Thanks to the Suzuki's flat front, Hammond came close to a centimetre. Clarkson crashed the Transit into the back of the car, and May's LDV was completely outpaced. Next the presenters were told to replace their driver's side doors. Hammond and May were able to remove their doors easily, while Clarkson simply rammed his off with the LDV. He then used tape to fix a new door on, while Hammond successfully fitted his with bolts; May eventually ran out of time. The fifth challenge tested how long a burglar took to break into the rear door of each van; the burglar failed to open Hammond's, smashed open May's in half a minute, but took only 10 seconds to break into the Transit. Finally the presenters were tasked with outrunning a police patrol car driven by the Stig on their test track. Clarkson won the event, which also featured a spectacular roll-over by Hammond trying to achieve the Scandinavian flick while going round the first corner. Hammond, however, still won the overall challenge. Winner: Hammond =US Special - Used American car for $1000 challenge= Series Nine, Episode Three The presenters wanted to find out if it was easier to buy a car for a holiday rather than hire one, so each of them was given a budget of US$1000 to purchase a car, which they would take on a road trip across four US states, from Miami, Florida to New Orleans, Louisiana. Clarkson bought a 1989 Chevrolet Camaro, May got a 1989 Cadillac Brougham Sedan, while Hammond bought a Dodge Ram pick- up truck. During their journey they were given a series of challenges, which included the cars being driven around a track by The Stig's overweight \\"American cousin,\\" doing 0 to 50 to 0 without over-running the track and thereby crashing into a river full of alligators, and camping a night in a field eating only roadkill. They also had to paint slogans on each other's car in order to get them shot at or arrested as they drove across Alabama. When the three pulled into a petrol station to refuel, the station's owner called a gang and attacked them and their film crew with stones and chased them out of town. Upon arrival at New Orleans, the three presenters found the city was taking a long time to recover from Hurricane Katrina and thus could not bring themselves to ask for money for their cars. They instead gave them away to people who needed them. In the episode's credits, the presenters were credited as \\"Cletus Clarkson\\", \\"Earl Hammond JR\\", \\"Ellie May May\\" and \\"Roscoe P. Stig\\". All of the other credited crew had their first names changed to \\"Billy Bob\\". Winner: Clarkson Clarkson declared himself the winner and May as the loser (as he could not even give his car away). =¬£1,500 two-wheel drive African cross- country car challenge= Series Ten, Episode Four The presenters were sent to Botswana to buy a car that was not an off-road vehicle and had only two-wheel drive, which they would drive across the country, from the eastern border of Zimbabwe to the western border of Namibia (approximately 1,000 miles). The challenge included a drive over the Makgadikgadi Pan, which left Clarkson and May's cars filled with dust after they had been stripped of excess weight as to try to prevent their cars sinking through the thin surface, and over the Okavango Delta. This was to prove \\"to the people of Surrey that they don't need 4√ó4s in case there are leaves on the road.\\" This challenge introduced a new rule that stipulated if any of the presenters' cars were to break down beyond repair, they would have to complete the journey in a substitute vehicle - for this challenge, a Volkswagen Beetle (the Beetle being the presenters' unanimous choice as their least favourite car). Clarkson bought a 1981 Lancia Beta Coup√©, which was the most unreliable car of the lot. Hammond bought a 1963 Opel Kadett, which he named Oliver (consequently becoming the butt of jokes of the other presenters), while May bought a 1985 Mercedes-Benz 230E. Hammond felt such affection for his car that he subsequently had it shipped to the UK (which resulted in Clarkson and May making fun of him), and it now has the occasional cameo on Richard Hammond's Blast Lab. Oliver was Hammond's \\"prized possession\\" in the Top Gear 'Lorryist' challenge. All three made it to the Namibian border. Clarkson declared the Beetle as the winner, since it had no documented mishaps during the trip, much to the shock of Hammond, with which May answered \\"he's right!\\" Winner: Volkswagen Beetle (back up car) =British Leyland did make some good cars after all challenge= Series Ten, Episode Seven In an argument with the producers of Top Gear, the presenters claimed British Leyland did produce some good cars, despite being on strike most of the time and not producing cars at all. So, they were given a budget of ¬£1,200 (of their own money) to buy a British Leyland car in which they would face a series of challenges, for which, instead of points, they would earn money back. These mostly took place at the MIRA proving ground, though the last one was at the Top Gear test track, where they tried to see how much of the track they could complete whilst their cars were full of water. Hammond went over the budget to get a 1974 Triumph Dolomite Sprint for ¬£1,250, Clarkson got a 1981 Rover SD1 for ¬£1,100 which consequently lost two doors in unrelated incidents, whereas May spent ¬£1,000 and acquired a 1978 Princess that was likened to a wedge of cheese. The boys also reproduced the intro of Money from the various squeaks and clunks their cars made. After all the challenges, Clarkson summed up the money and declared May the winner of the challenge, as not only did he get back all that he had paid, he made a ¬£20 profit. Winner: May =Make a police car for a lot less money than the real police spend on their cars challenge= Series Eleven, Episode One The presenters were all given ¬£1,000 to buy a car and turn them into police cars able to surpass the Police's standard-issue Vauxhall Astra Diesels. Clarkson bought a 1998 Fiat Coup√© 20V Turbo for ¬£900, painted it in Italian Polizia di Stato livery (although the colour was wrong), and fitted it with \\"Boudicea\\" wheel covers. May bought a 1994 Lexus LS400 for ¬£900 as well, which he painted in a traditional 'jam sandwich' livery, fitted with a siren from an ice cream van, and armed with paint sprayers at the back. Hammond bought a 1994 Suzuki Vitara for ¬£750, and equipped it with light bars and a self-deploying stinger on the front (actually several doormats stitched together with nails poking through). The presenters' cars were then put to test around the Top Gear track, which included beating the Stig's lap in the Vauxhall Astra diesel (coupled with extra points for flamboyance), clearing a crash site in less than two minutes, and then stopping the Stig in a police chase (the latter driving a BMW 7-Series) \\"Without using ¬£125,000 worth of Volvo, the RAF, and 16 health and safety forms.\\" The real police first demonstrated how to stop the stolen car using four Volvo V70 estates, boxing in the car to the side of the road, following the fulfillment of \\"13 separate health and safety criteria.\\" All three cars were subsequently displayed at the British Motor Show 2008. Winner: HammondDuring the results, Hammond claimed that Clarkson got 98 points (if he had 100 he would win the challenge), and eating the paper saying Clarkson had \\"98 points,\\" suggesting Hammond was hiding something. Clarkson claimed \\"Since I am not prepared to go through your stools in the morning, we have to conclude that the best car for the British police is a Suzuki Vitara with a doormat on the front.\\" =Can you buy an Alfa Romeo for ¬£1000 or less without it completely ruining your life all the time? challenge= Series Eleven, Episode Three The presenters' Alfas when the challenge ended. From left to right, Hammond's Spider, Clarkson's 75 and May's GTV. The presenters were challenged with proving to the show's producers that in order to be a true \\"petrol head\\", you need to have owned an Alfa Romeo. So, they were each given ¬£1,000 to buy their own Alfa Romeo. Clarkson bought a 1989 Alfa Romeo 75 3.0 V6 (for ¬£450), Hammond bought a 1984 Alfa Romeo Spider 2.0 (for ¬£1,000), and May bought a 1996 Alfa Romeo GTV 2.0 TwinSpark (for ¬£995). The cars were put to a series of tests, which included participating in a track day on the Rockingham Motor Speedway road course, featuring their cars on a calendar which they must sell at a newsstand, and then lastly entering an Alfa Romeo exclusive Concours d'Elegance event, traveling as far as 80 miles to get to the event area. At the race circuit, the presenters were to gain a point for every car they overtook and lose a point each time they were overtaken. As the field consisted predominately of high-end sports and supercars, none of the presenters managed to overtake any competitors. Clarkson rolled his car attempting to overtake a Ford Focus. In a side challenge, each presenters had to create a calendar featuring their cars which was to be sold at a newsstand. None of the presenters' calendars managed to sell even a single copy. After the track day, the presenters then had to prep their cars for a Concours d'Elegance competition. Clarkson decided to respray his car in Skoda Green, a colour he used on his Fiat Coupe in the Police Car Challenge. May meticulously cleaned his car, being careful to remove all the dust from the interior and bodywork, and Hammond re-upholstered his seats using Clarkson's leather jacket. During the journey to the Concours, Hammond had to manually send coolant into his engine using a hand cranked pump (due to a broken water pump during the track day challenge). This eventually broke, and his engine seized, forcing May to tow him. After crashing into May a few times, May got fed up and abandoned him. Clarkson helped to tow Hammond despite his gearbox nearing the end of its life, and the two sabotaged May's engine bay with cheese. After the judges finished, James was awarded 74 out of a possible 150 points while Jeremy and Richard were given 23.5 and 9 respectively - the lowest scores in Concours history. Clarkson was declared the overall victor (largely due to the car's low price), which pleased him greatly as it was his first victory in three years for a cheap car challenge. Winner: Clarkson =Mercedes-Benz 600 vs Rolls-Royce Corniche Coup√© challenge= Series Eleven, Episode Five Clarkson and May attempted to find out which of their classic luxury limousines‚ÄîClarkson's 1969 Mercedes-Benz 600 \\"Grosser\\" or May's 1972 Rolls-Royce Corniche‚Äîwas better. So they brought their cars to the Top Gear Test Track for a series of challenges. This was not a real \\"Cheap Car Challenge\\", as Hammond did not participate, the presenters owned the cars prior to the challenge, and neither cars were particularly cheap. They summarised the choice as \\"...between 'Camp' and 'Camp Commandant'...\\" based on the previous owners of the vehicles they were using in the challenge. No winner declared =How much lorry do you get for ¬£5000 challenge= Series Twelve, Episode One Unable to understand how lorry-driving can be so hard, the presenters each bought a second-hand lorry for under ¬£5,000. May bought a Scania P94D, Clarkson bought a Renault Magnum and Hammond bought an ERF EC11. Clarkson painted his lorry black, resulting in multiple visibility problems (because he also painted 2/3 of the windscreen black). Hammond tried to Americanise his lorry by attaching a dog kennel to the front of his lorry. May attached many flowers and decorations to make it look like an Indian lorry. After decorating their lorries, they were sent to Millbrook Proving Ground, where the first challenge was to successfully powerslide their lorries on a skid pan (as demonstrated by \\"The Stig's Lorry-driving Cousin\\"). None were successful, May's mudguard fell off, Clarkson got his \\"gear lever up his arse\\", while Hammond's dog kennel fell off. After several attempts at attaching trailers, the second challenge involved driving round the Alpine handling course in the fastest time possible with their trailers loaded with various awkward loads (Hammond an unsecured Nissan Micra, May a wedding cake, and Clarkson hay bales and an electric fire). Hammond was left far behind as he was unable to get his lorry in gear, and Clarkson took the lead until he forgot to change down for a steep hill and stalled. May broadsided him on as he passed, causing the brakes to become jammed on. A victorious May discovered his wedding cake had toppled over, while Hammond drove so violently his car fell out of the lorry. After fixing his brakes, Clarkson arrived last with his trailer on fire. The next challenge featured the lorries speed limiters removed, in a race around the two-mile bowl of Millbrook to see which was fastest; Hammond won with his lightweight ERF hitting 90 miles an hour. The fourth test had each presenter attempting to perform a hill start with their vehicles, and to encourage them, prized possessions were placed behind each of their lorries. Jeremy, with his drum kit placed behind his lorry, was successful as his vehicle had a crawler gear, although May and Hammond promptly ran over and smashed the drum kit. Oliver, Hammond's restored Opel Kadett from the Botswana adventure, was placed behind his lorry and he eventually forfeited rather than risk crushing it. May's grand piano was smashed when he failed to prevent his lorry from rolling backwards, although the production crew had already damaged it while positioning it. The final challenge, for speed, braking, and toughness had each presenter driving their vehicles through an obstacle at 56 miles an hour, and the winner going the shortest distance after hitting it. Hammond managed to stop his lorry in a shorter distance after driving through a mobile home than May did after driving through a structure built out of six hundred water coolers. Clarkson travelled the shortest distance, but was injured after driving his lorry through a brick wall. Each of the presenters complained that they had not received the best obstacle. At the end, the \\"hopelessly complicated\\" scores were tallied, and May was declared the winner. Winner: May =Vietnam Special= Series Twelve, Episode Eight The three presenters went on a trip to Vietnam where they were each given 15 million Vietnamese ƒë·ªìng to buy a \\"set of wheels\\" able to drive 1,000 miles from Ho Chi Minh City in the south to Halong Bay in the north. However, due to the car prices and the money they were given, the task was completed using cheap motorbikes. The goal was essentially to do in eight days what the Americans failed to do in the ten years of the Vietnam War. As in previous challenges, the producers provided a replacement vehicle to any presenter whose vehicle broke down, in this challenge a Honda minibike decorated in a stars and Stripes livery with Born in the USA by Bruce Springsteen playing on an iPod (redubbed with The Star-Spangled Banner in some versions), causing much distress to the presenters due to the Vietnam War with America. Upon reaching Ha Long, the presenters were given the task of modifying their bikes to reach a floating bar. Both Clarkson and Hammond reached the bar on their bikes/boats. May's bike/boat sank and he finished by swimming to the bar. Clarkson emerged victorious by reaching the bar first. Winner: Clarkson =Safe, interesting cars for 17-year-olds that can be insured challenge= Series Thirteen, Episode Two With a budget of ¬£2,500 each including insurance, the three bought cars that were \\"ideal\\" for 17-year-olds. Clarkson bought a 1995 Volvo 940 estate, Hammond a 1993 Hyundai Scoupe and May a 1994 Volkswagen Golf Mk III. They were then given a series of challenges, including driving across a field after a rave, parking cars at night, and an obstacle course in which each presenter had to drive round the course and hit as many of the obstacles as they could. Winner: Clarkson = Seeking petrolhead heaven in three ¬£1500 rear-wheel drive coupes= Series Thirteen, Episode Five With a budget of ¬£1,500, Clarkson, May and Hammond had to buy a rear wheel drive car. Clarkson bought a 1991 Porsche 944, May bought a 1983 Ford Capri (but switched to the 1977 Morris Marina backup car after the Ford broke down) and Hammond bought a 1991 Nissan 300ZX. They faced numerous challenges including trying to beat a 1-minute, 32.31 second lap time set by a Renault Twingo, and accelerating to 60 mph and then braking to 0 mph within 200 metres or risk destroying something belonging to them. May ended up destroying another one of his pianos. As a finale, they participated in an Andros Trophy ice race (which included F1 driver Olivier Panis) against heavily modified hatchbacks, ultimately being lapped several times (on one occasion, Panis referred to the Marina as \\"a shitbox\\"). May emerged victorious (mainly due to Hammond and Clarkson duelling throughout the race,) in the Morris Marina, which had a piano dropped on it in the end. Winner: May =Buying a pre-1982 car for less than ¬£3,000= Series Thirteen, Episode Six The three were told to go to a car auction and buy any car for less than ¬£3,000 that was built before 1982. Clarkson wanted a convertible and bought a 1969 Austin-Healey Sprite, although he used some of his own money to buy it, as he bought it for ¬£3,600. Hammond \\"went ugly early\\" and bought the first lot, a 1953 ¬£1000 Lanchester LJ 200. May was set to buy a Bristol, which went over his budget in bidding, and because there was only one car after the Bristol he was forced to buy the last car of the auction‚Äîa ¬£1500 1977 blue Citro√´n Ami Estate. They were then told to go to Mallorca for a rally, with two challenges spread over two days. They were also introduced to their co- drivers by the producers. Clarkson was given the head of Balaeric Rallying Club, who spoke no English. Hammond was assigned Brian Wheeler, a sarcastic dwarf mechanic. May was given glamour model and Page 3 girl Madison Welch. Upon arriving in Mallorca, the presenters discovered that they were almost two days late for the rally, which was a five-day event, and thus had no chance of winning. They chose to bet ¬£25 on whichever one of them had the best score at the end of the rally. Clarkson's malfunctioning gauges made calculating his speed difficult, May had to cope with Welch's initial lack of interest and navigating experience, and Hammond's Lanchester proved incredibly unreliable, breaking down several times per stage and overheating constantly. While Clarkson was in the lead heading into the final day, May posted the most consistent lap times at the regularity track day and inched out Clarkson in the final challenge. After the challenge it was revealed that all three presenters liked their chosen cars so much they had bought them from the BBC. Winner: May =Bolivia Special= Series Fourteen, Episode Six The three presenters travelled 1,000 miles through the rainforests of Bolivia to the Pacific coast of Chile. They used pre-owned off-road vehicles, bought in Bolivia (unseen via the internet) for less than ¬£3,500 each. Hammond bought a tan Toyota Land Cruiser, which had been converted into a soft top convertible by a previous owner. Despite the car's reputation for durability, it turned out to be the most unreliable car, suffering multiple drivetrain and suspension breakdowns right from the start. It was damaged beyond repair on the sand-dune descent. Hammond nicknamed his Land Cruiser \\"Donkey.\\" Clarkson bought a red Range Rover, which he believed had a 3.9-litre fuel-injected engine. However, when he showed his co-presenters under the bonnet, May noted it had carburettors, making it the older 3.5-litre model. Overall Clarkson's Range Rover turned out to be the most reliable, despite the car's reputation otherwise. May bought a red (although \\"..in the advert it was blue...\\") Suzuki Samurai with a 1.3-litre engine, which was the smallest of the three vehicles. Despite this, May made no modifications, and it had the least breakdowns. One disadvantage of the Suzuki was its open differentials, which until fixed made it \\"3-wheel drive\\" Winner: Clarkson =A track day car which is as good in the real world= Series Fifteen, Episode Two The three were sent to Germany, and given a budget of ¬£5,000 to buy a 4-door saloon that would be as good in the real world as it would be on a track day. May bought a 1986 Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.3-16v Cosworth, Hammond a 1996 E36 BMW M3, and Clarkson a 1989 Ford Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth. Challenges included determining their cars' top speed on an unregulated autobahn, interior space (by carrying a German Oompah band), and an ADAC evaluation of the cars. The BMW initially performed well until it came last in the evaluation test, revealing badly repaired accident damage. Finally, the presenters went to a circuit, where the cars were lapped by the Stig's German cousin. In the studio there were the results of two more unbroadcast challenges: points for each viewing of a track day video uploaded to YouTube, and an economy run.Exclusive - the video you didn't see on last week's show. The last test was based on price - each pound under the budget received one point - meaning that the ¬£4,999 Sierra and the ¬£3,990 M3 lost to the ¬£2,990 190E. Winner: May =Campervan challenge= Series Fifteen, Episode Four Bemoaning the fact that campervans are either the huge American style motor homes unsuitable for European roads or the tiny and cramped European models, the presenters were challenged to construct inexpensive campervans that would be comfortable to sleep in yet manageable on narrow twisting European roads. They had to have a sleeping area, a toilet and a cooking area. Clarkson constructed a three-storey Bauhaus inspired campervan on a 1988 Citro√´n CX chassis. May attached a roofbox with a sleeping bag on top of a 1987 Lotus Excel and Hammond constructed a collapsible cottage on the back of a 1984 Land Rover 110. Clarkson found his Citro√´n difficult to drive and nearly toppled over several times. May‚Äôs Lotus was cramped and Hammond‚Äôs design was cumbersome and impractical. Challenges included driving to a camp ground in Polzeath, Cornwall, changing into a wet suit inside the campervan, sleeping, 'going to the bog' in their campervans, and cooking a meal. During the meal challenge, Richard set fire to his cottage. Later, the three took a trip to a beauty spot in Hartland in North Devon where Hammond and May 'accidentally' rolled Jeremy‚Äôs Citro√´n over a cliff. Back in the studio, Clarkson protested but all three presenters reluctantly came to the conclusion that although James had the fewest problems with his campervan (the only one being space), all of their designs were rubbish. No winner. =British Sports Car challenge= Series Fifteen, Episode Six The boys attempt to prove that old British sports cars never deserved to be killed off by the hot hatch. Jeremy buys a 1974 Jensen-Healey, James buys a 1989 TVR S2 and Richard buys a 1994 Lotus M100 Elan. The trip involved going to the places where all their cars were 'born', beginning at the Lotus factory in Norfolk, then onto the Jensen factory in West Bromwich, before finishing at the TVR factory in Blackpool. There was no winner, as the team said that all of their cars were the best. All winners =Middle East Special= Series Sixteen, Episode Zero- TwoList of Top Gear episodes#Series 16 .282010.E2.80.9311.29 The three were given ¬£3,500 to buy a 2-door convertible sports car, find their way to the birthplace of Jesus, and provide Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh as per the Three Wise Men. Hammond bought a 2000 Fiat Barchetta, Clarkson bought a 2000 Mazda MX5 and James cheated and bought a 1998 BMW Z3 over budget for ¬£3,966. The starting point was Iraq - which the three were unaware of until they landed. They were given flak jackets and helmets to get to their location. There was also at least one armed guard travelling with the group. As has happened on previous challenges, a spare car was provided by the producers should any of the cars critically break down. In this case it was an Opel Astra 1.6 convertible - a car loathed by all three presenters. During the challenge, May had a concussion in the middle of the desert, resulting in a trip to hospital. He was discharged later in the episode and continued the journey. Upon reaching their final hotel, the three set out to buy gifts: Hammond bought a gold necklace of Jesus' face, May bought a bottle of Frankincense ‚Äî in fact, a bottle of hotel shampoo ‚Äî and Clarkson was unable to find any Myrrh, so bought a Nintendo DS. After following a star they were led to a stable containing shepherds (who apparently arrived on quad bikes,) Mary & Joseph (although not identified as such,) and a manger. They presented their gifts, and asked to see the child, which was revealed to be a baby Stig. Hammond's Fiat was voted the best by both Clarkson and May, to Hammond's obvious surprise. Winner: Hammond =Four seater convertibles for less than ¬£2000 (that all turned out to be BMW 325i's) challenge= Series Sixteen, Episode Four The three were given ¬£2,000 to buy a four-seater convertible car. However, they all buy the same car: a BMW 325i. Hammond bought a 1987 model for ¬£1,600 which had done 94,318 miles according to the odometer, and had aftermarket wheels, aftermarket alarm, a lower suspension and extra locks fitted. Clarkson bought a 1988 model for ¬£1,950 which had done 137,488 miles and had a paving slab in the boot (to improve handling) and May a 1989 model for ¬£1,900 with no modifications. Clarkson decided to turn the challenge into a test to see how different the three supposedly identical cars had become over time, so the trio ignored the producers' challenges and devised their own. First there was a drag race which Hammond was unable to take part in as his car broke down due to the alarm (for which he was deducted 1,000 points): accelerate to 100 mph then stop again. May won comfortably as his car proved to be in better mechanical condition than Clarkson's. This led to Clarkson claiming that speed is not everything and May disagreeing, in stark contrast to their usual opinions. Next the cars were examined by a forensics team to test the condition of their interior. Clarkson's car contained crisps, leaves, and his own dried skin, which he claimed was not disgusting at all and lost no points. May's car was in worse condition with nasal mucus, scabs and saliva costing him 30 points. Hammond again fared the worst with saliva, blood and pubic hairs, losing 30 points and, worst of all, faeces losing another 1,000 points. Next, thieves attempted to steal all three cars: Clarkson and May's cars were still there after 20 minutes, but Hammond's was stolen almost immediately losing him yet another 1,000 points. The trio were then required to lap the Top Gear Test Track in their cars, trying to match the Stig's time done in a modern BMW 325i. Clarkson recorded the fastest time despite blowing his engine, followed by Hammond with May slowest. After that, the three cars were filled with helium and the presenters were required to sit in them to test for leaks. Clarkson and May's voices went high and squeaky due to the gas, but Hammond's did not as it had leaked out, once again leading to a 1,000 point deduction. The cars were then inspected to determine how much money was needed to restore them to showroom condition. May's required ¬£5,500, Hammond's ¬£7,500 and Clarkson's ¬£11,000. Finally the presenters decided to form a stunt driving team in front of a live audience at the Essex County Fair (this did not count towards the points challenge), they all collided almost immediately. When the points were tallied up, May won easily due to his car being in the best condition so having the lowest restoration cost. Clarkson narrowly beat Hammond to second place as his far higher restoration cost was marginally outweighed by Hammond's numerous thousand-point deductions. This led Clarkson to conclude two things: 'all identical cars aren't necessarily identical' and 'Richard Hammond, who buys more used cars than any man alive, is useless at buying used cars'. Winner: May =Super Coupes for less than the Nissan Pixo= Series Seventeen, Episode Three Jeremy and Richard were given the challenge of buying the best car possible for less than ¬£6,995, the price of a Nissan Pixo, the cheapest car on sale in Britain at the time. Clarkson chose a top of the range 2002 Mercedes CL600 for ¬£6995, and Hammond bought a 1994 BMW 850ci for ¬£6,700, which he declared the best because it had pop up headlamps. Challenges included a drag race which Hammond lost badly, a dyno run, (which showed Hammond having 269bhp against the original 296bhp, and Clarkson with 352 versus 362,) and a return to the forensics lab to establish what contaminants were present in the cars. (The forensics test is usually edited out on repeats.) During a drive in the countryside Clarkson commented that that there was no reason to buy a new Mercedes when his 2002 ¬£6995 car drove just as well and everything still worked - except for the voice recognition which he reasoned never worked, even in new cars. At Market Harborough they displayed their cars to the public, asking what the perceived value was, with general estimates being from ¬£12,000 to ¬£20,000. Back in the studio May criticised the two for eschewing the reliable, economical and practical Pixo, saying he was prepared \\"to bet his hair\\" that within two weeks one of the two cars would require expensive servicing or repairs. Later in the series May was proved correct when Clarkson's Mercedes broke down and he had to spend several thousand pounds fixing the engine's injectors.http://www.topgearbox.com/2011/episode-guides/series-17/top-gear- series-17-episode-3/ No winner declared =India Special= Series Seventeen, Episode Seven The three were given ¬£7,000 to buy a reliable British classic car and use them on the streets of India. Jeremy bought a 1995 Jaguar XJS 4.0 Celebration Edition, James bought a 1976 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow and Hammond bought a 2000 Mini 1.3L. As in previous challenges, a backup car was also present, a 1979 Austin Allegro. Challenges included bringing Western-themed goods with their cars and building a stall to promote them, A mountain rally and modifying their cars to be better able to tackle the dangerous mountain roads. All Winners =Rallycross with less investment than golfing= Series Eighteen, Episode Seven The three criticise the sheer amount of money people have to spend just to play golf, and they claimed that you can invest less money in car racing, or in this case, rallycross. To prove this, each of the presenters must find a cheap, race-worthy car and modify it so it can be race- ready. Clarkson bought a BMW 328i, Hammond bought a Citroen Saxo 1.6 VTS, and May bought a Toyota MR2. Hammond was the most successful of the three, finishing third in two heats and coming second in the final, ahead of Clarkson. Meanwhile, May was the least successful, finishing last in two heats and third in the 'loser's final'. The trio then conclude that you can go motor racing with less investment than golfing (all the cars, including race modifications, costs less than ¬£2000, whereas golf costs more than that). Winner: Hammond =Finding the source of the river Nile= Series Nineteen, Episode Six and Seven The three were given a budget of ¬£1,500 to buy a second hand estate car in Britain which they would then be using to find the source of the River Nile in Africa. Clarkson bought a 1999 BMW 528i, May a 1996 Volvo 850 R and Hammond a 2002 Subaru Impreza WRX. The Backup car was a 1998 Ford Scorpio, a car loathed by all three. The starting point was a small town in Uganda. After travelling to Lake Victoria, generally considered to be the source of the Nile, the guys reasoned that as Victoria is fed by many other tributaries, one of those must be the true source. After spending the night at an unhygienic hotel the guys decided to convert their cars into 'mobile homes'. Hammond installed a kitchen, Clarkson a cool box full of beer, and a toilet on the outside of his car. May fitted a library at the front of his car, and a workshop complete with tools at the rear. All of them also installed some sort of bed. After a long drive through Africa, which showed that Hammond made a clever choice with his all wheel drive Subaru, the guys had to cross a wide river, and built a raft to convey their cars. All three made it across safely, but the producers lost the Scorpio after it fell off the raft and into the river. During the journey as each presenter's car suffered and broke down they stole bits from each others cars to carry on. Eventually Hammond's car broke a wishbone and had to weld it back together in order to finish the challenge. Near the end of the challenge, the guys were informed that only one presenter could find the source and get his name in the history books, so each raced to where they suspected the source would be. Despite Hammond making best progress thanks to his AWD, May was the first to find the true source of the Nile, making him the winner. Winner: May. =Proving that hot hatchbacks from their youth are better than their modern equivalents= Series Twenty-One, Episode One They were sent out to buy any hot hatchback from their youth - specifically the 1980s. Clarkson bought a 1989 Volkswagen Golf GTi for ¬£800, May bought a 1992 Ford Fiesta XR2i for ¬£750 and Hammond bought a 1992 Vauxhall Nova SRi for ¬£700. Challenges faced included a hill climb (during the return trip, Hammond crashed his Nova, setting up a running joke throughout the challenge,) a \\"supermarket sweep\\" gymkhana event through a closed supermarket, (with Hammond again finishing on his side), and a drag race, in which Hammond critically damaged his car's engine after accidentally changing from second gear into first instead of third. The last challenge involved the cars being chased by the \\"TGPD\\" (Top Gear Police Department) to see how long they could evade pursuit. Hammond was caught instantly due to his damaged engine, while both Clarkson and May had their cars destroyed after long drawn out pursuits. In the end the presenters decided that as all their cars had won an individual event, all three were the winners. All winners =Burma Special= Series Twenty-One, Episode Six and Seven The three presenters find themselves travelling out to Burma for a road trip to Thailand and the River Kwai, each taking with them a second-hand lorry that they will use to build a bridge over it - Clarkson buys an Isuzu TX that has an extensive stereo setup in the cab and a dumper truck layout in the back, Hammond purchases another Isuzu TX, but modified with extensive space for carrying large volume loads, while May acquires a Hino FB110 with a crane on the back. Starting their journey in the country's old capital of Rangoon, they continue through Naypyidaw, before crossing into Thailand. They are challenged with building a bridge across the River Kwai, then driving over it with their trucks, but realise when constructing the bridge that they are actually at the River Kok. All Winners =Homemade ambulance challenge= Series Twenty-Two, Episode Three The men decide to improve ambulances. Initially, they modify a P45 (Series 19, Episode 1) with a flashing beacon and a gurney which attaches to a rear-mounted hitch, but this fails when the gurney jackknifes and ejects the patient. The producers then instruct the presenters to 'do it properly', and each buy an alternative to the standard ambulance used by the NHS (a Mercedes Sprinter), with their choices being tested in a series of challenges. For ¬£5000, Hammond bought a customised Chevy G20 V8 Van, which he lauded for its 5.7 litre V8 engine and its bargain price (compared to the ¬£150,000 cost of a standard NHS ambulance). Clarkson bought a Porsche 944 Turbo, with the idea that the patient could be stowed under the all-glass hatchback; Hammond points out that the patient would bake in the tight, glass-enclosed space. May bought a Ford Scorpio Cardinal hearse which was initially mocked by the others, despite May pointing out the potent Cosworth-designed V6 engine and traction control. Winner: Hammond =Find a cheap car that still lives up to the title of classic= Series Twenty-Two, Episode Eight Due to rocketing classic car prices, a Jaguar E-Type is worth ¬£200,000, whereas a Ferrari Daytona is worth ¬£700,000, and an Aston Martin DB5 is worth ¬£1,000,000. The trio are told to buy affordable classics and report with them to an old railway station in Buckinghamshire. There, they are told they must live like classic car enthusiasts. Hammond arrives first in a 1972 MGB GT, a car that he believes is the most iconic British sports car. Clarkson arrives next in a 1978 Fiat 124 Spider which he admits is incredibly pretty but predicts it will go wrong all the time like all classic cars. He also bemoans the fact that it is an American specification vehicle with 5-mph bumpers, raised ride height, and oversized aftermarket wheels, giving it poor handling. Finally, May arrives in a 1986 Peugeot 304 S Cabriolet which arrives already broken down. The trio are challenged to 'tinker' with their cars, with May simply fixing his so it works and adding continental yellow headlamps, Clarkson returning his to its original European specification (and having an epiphany as he did so), while Hammond gave his MGB sporting credentials with a new exhaust, bucket seats and a sporty paint scheme. After being allowed to take part in a Japfest show at Castle Combe circuit it is ascertained that May has the worst car, yet Hammond & Clarkson are tied for points. Both cars suffer badly during the Japfest race, and are on the verge of breaking down - which Clarkson's eventually does leaving Hammond the winner by default. Hammond expected to be part of the aerial display, and was made to take part in a Wing walking demonstration during which he spent most of the time screaming. Winner: Hammond =Cheap SUV challenge= Series Twenty-Two, Episode eight In response to the growing numbers of lifestyle SUVs, they were challenged to buy a lifestyle SUV with a maximum budget of ¬£250. May was the first to arrive in a little 2001 Mitsubishi Shogun Pinin which he bought for ¬£150, followed by Hammond in a 1997 Jeep Cherokee which he bought for ¬£250, and then Clarkson in a 1998 Vauxhall Frontera Sport RS which he bought for ¬£140. Challenges include a snow slope climbing test (where Hammond failed to engage his 4WD), a game of tag with caravans hitched to their cars and featuring 'Leisure Stig' in a Kia Sportage, a 0-60 acceleration and braking test at a muddy test area with 'Leisure Stig' setting the benchmark in the Sportage, (which May failed to complete, and drove into a muddy pond,) modifying their own cars to suit the lifestyle theme better and doing some 'leisure activity' at a nearby pond, rolling their cars down a steep cliff to test the car's robustness and safety, and a five-mile-long off-road race from a Yorkshire grouse moor to a conference and dinner held at Yorkshire's Broughton Hall, where the last to arrive had to do an after-dinner speech. During the race, James was initially left far behind, but caught up later due to his finding a farm track that enabled him to overtake Clarkson and Hammond, who were bogged down. Hammond eventually freed himself from the mud, and Clarkson, upset for not being able to climb the riverbank after fording a small river, had to cut the Frontera in half. Eventually, Hammond had to deliver the after dinner speech, which didn't please the crowds. This challenge was the last completed by Clarkson, Hammond and May. Loser: Hammond =Find something that offers more luxury than the Orient Express= Series Twenty-Three, Episode Four Evans, Sabine and Matt were given a maximum budget of ¬£3,066 - the price of an Orient Express ticket - to buy something equally luxurious, while Eddie boarded the Orient Express itself. Evans opted for a 2002 Jaguar XJ8 which set him back ¬£2,100, Sabine bought a 2002 Audi A8 for ¬£2,750, while Matt bought a 1989 Honda Goldwing for ¬£2,500. The presenters raced against each other with Eddie boarding the Orient Express from London to Venice. On the way, Matt, Evans and Sabine were presented with a challenge: pick a Michelin star chef in Paris and allow them to prepare food to be presented at a chateau along the way. Evans and Sabine found the challenge to be a relatively easy one, since their cars' cabin space allow the chef to prepare the food and the heat from their cars' engine (and from the exhaust pipes in Evans' case) allowed the food to be cooked along the way. Matt, however, had to make several stops to allow his chef to prepare and cook the food, slowing down his progress. Sabine was declared winner of this challenge. During the next leg, Matt was hindered by his motorcycle's small fuel tank, and Sabine ran out of money, forcing her to reach the destination on foot. Evans on the other hand had enough money left from his purchase to hire a water taxi until Venice's water speed limit hindered him. Eddie made it first to the finish, joined by Sabine, and soon after Evans. Matt was still on the road, but he believed himself to be in the lead. Once back in the studio Evans, Sabine and Matt pointed out that they still had their vehicles (although Matt decided to sell his Goldwing,) while all Eddie had as a souvenir was a pair of spoons from the train. Winner: Eddie =Kazakhstan Road Trip= Series Twenty-Four, Episode One Matt, Rory, and Chris were instructed to buy a car with at least 480,000 miles on the clock - a distance equal to driving to the Moon and back. Chris bought a Volvo V70 Bi-Fuel, Matt a Mercedes-Benz E-Class that was previously used as a taxi in Germany, and Rory bought a London black cab. They were told to report to Kazakhstan, where they were to drive to the Baikonur Cosmodrome. During the first part of the challenge, they raced against each other at a quarry, with Chris crashing into Matt, then heading to Kyzylorda to participate in a game of auto-tag against locals in Lada Rivas. The next morning, Matt fitted a custom crash bar made out of steel pipes to protect his damaged back end, and Rory set a challenge of who can reach the closest top speed to its original factory claims. Chris clocked 104 mph against 125 mph, Matt clocked 100 mph versus 112 mph, while Rory clocked 84 mph - higher than the claimed top speed of 81 mph. The final challenge was to see who could log the most miles from the starting point to Baikonur with a condition: only the winner can attend the launch event, and the losing cars will be subjected to 'hard labour'. In preparation, Matt stripped the Mercedes to make it quicker, Chris repainted the Volvo so it resembled the Volvo 850 BTCC and installed a 'high-mileage fuel tank' - a 55-gallon oil drum - while Rory did nothing to his London black cab. Matt returned to a salt bed he previously passed through (where his silencer and makeshift crash bar fell off), Chris went into town to look for an airfield to race around, while Rory jacked up the back wheels of his cab and put it in gear so as to run up easy miles. While refuelling he knocked the jacks and the car drove off by itself, before beaching on a dune. At the cosmodrome the results were announced: Chris did 211 miles, Matt did 284 miles, Rory did 329 miles, and the losing cars were turned into taxicabs by locals. At the end of the show, Rory showed that his black cab had been mounted on a plinth beside the Buran spacecraft at the cosmodrome. Winner: Rory =Cuban road trip in secondhand sports cars= Series Twenty-Four, Episode Six Rory and Chris were instructed to buy a classic car with a budget of ¬£5,000 and report at the Bay of Pigs. Chris bought a Maserati Biturbo while Rory got himself a third- generation targa top Chevrolet Camaro RS. Along the way, Chris bragged about Maserati's victory in the past Cuban Grands Prix. Arriving at the first stop in a small town called Coliseo, Rory bragged about his Chevrolet V8 that was quickly recognised by the locals, compared to Chris' Maserati. Next, they headed to Varadero to see the local racing scene, where, along the way, Rory decided to allow locals to hitch a ride in their cars, much to his fear as one of his passengers brought a chicken inside. Upon arriving in Varadero, Rory and Chris decided to race the locals in a drag race, where both of them lost in a considerably large gap. Afterwards, they raced each other, where Rory claimed a \\"moral victory\\" due to his Camaro winning the locals' hearts thanks to the car's V8 engine. After the race, they headed to Havana, where Chris' had a nostalgia in the Malec√≥n road, where the first two Cuban Grands Prix were held. In the final part of the trip, both returned to Varadero to have a rematch with local street racers, only this time, they race in a makeshift oval track made using used tyres. After the grid's drawn through a drawing of straws, where Chris started second to last. During the race, Chris made a significant progress due to his agile Maserati, eventually winning the race. Winner: Chris =Secondhand sports cars in Honshu= Series Twenty-Five, Episode Three Matt and Chris were instructed to buy a second-hand 1990s Japanese sports car for a budget of 1 million yen (the equivalent of ¬£6,900) at the USS Tokyo car auction center to be shipped back and sold in Britain. Chris got himself a Mazda RX-7, while Matt bought a Nissan Skyline 25GT-T, which he mistook for a GT-R. Their first challenge was to do a two lap race in the Gunsai Touge while carrying sumo wrestler as a passenger, which Chris won. Next, they head to Fukushima to reminisce the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Afterwards, they head to the Ebisu Circuit to receive the next challenge: drifting against local drifters in Kei trucks. In order to aid the presenters to do tandem drifts, both cars' rear tires were swapped with space- saver spare tires and tied using a rope and secured with a pair of used tires. However, near the finish line, one of the tires blew up, damaging both cars. Then, the final challenge arrived: racing to Enbu to reach the transport, as there can only be one car that can be transported back to Britain. Matt and Chris go separate ways: Matt tried the highway approach, where he got stuck at a tollbooth, while Chris decided to take the mountain pass and the backroads, where he had to deal with local traffic. Chris won the race by a small margin, however, back in the UK, his RX-7 didn't get a profitable offer. Winner: Chris =Secondhand luxury cars for less than Dacia Sandero= Series Twenty-Six, Episode Four The presenters are looking for a secondhand luxury car that costs less than a brand new Dacia Sandero, which has a price of ¬£6,000. Matt bought a 1988 Bentley Turbo R, Rory bought a 1975 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, while Chris bought a 1992 Mercedes-Benz 600 SEL, which the other two presenters loathe. For the first challenge, the presenters head to the track for a top speed drag race. In this challenge, Rory scored 70 mph, Matt scored 110 mph, while Chris scored 135 mph. Next, the presenters are faced with a series of challenges, beginning with a beat-the-clock challenge in a simulated urban driving environment against The Stig in the Sandero, where Matt's Bentley suffered a breakdown and Rory wrecking the market square part of the course. Afterwards, to test if the cars can still run straight and true like when they were new, the cars were put on a \\"no-hands\\" drag race against the Sandero, where all of the used cars failed the challenge. Then, the presenters are instructed to do a pursuit race against the Sandero in a single lap of the track, preceded by a dyno run to measure how far will the cars have to be behind the Sandero. At the rolling road, Rory's Rolls-Royce scored 161.9 hp from its original 189 hp, Matt's Bentley scored 262.1 hp from its original 300 hp, while Chris' Mercedes 379.7 hp from its standard 394 hp. This makes Rory has to start 87 meters behind the Sandero, followed by Matt at 187 meters behind the Sandero, and Chris at 305 meters behind the Sandero, however, Matt's Bentley refused to start at this point. The Sandero won again this time, out-gripping both the cars. As a final challenge, the presenters have to participate in a six-hour endurance race (the Birkett 6 hour relay race) at Silverstone, with the Sandero as a backup car. Initially, Chris made a good progress, managing to catch up a considerable number of cars at the early stages of the race. However, he soon had to pit due to his Mercedes running out of fuel, and Matt's hastily refurbished Bentley didn't make much progress due to him having no time to address the car's brakes. Rory didn't fare much better, as his Rolls-Royce lacking grip, slow, having no working gauges, and poor fuel consumption. In the middle of the race, Chris' Mercedes lost one of its wheels, causing a considerable damage to its running gear. Later on the race, due to all of the cars terminally damaged, Chris was forced to use the race-prepped Sandero. In a last ditch attempt, Matt's Bentley received a brake caliper donor from Rory's Rolls-Royce to address the Bentley's failing brakes and enabling them to reach the second-to-last position that they've aimed for. =First cars for less than ¬£4,000= Series Twenty-Seven, Episode One The presenters were given a budget of ¬£4,000 - the average cost of a first car in the UK - to hunt for secondhand as close as possible to their respective first cars and report to Ethiopia. Paddy settled for a Mark II Ford Escort which he bought in Gauteng, South Africa for ¬£2,100, Freddie bought a 1999 Porsche Boxster for ¬£3,700, and Chris chose a 1990 Mini for ¬£3,300. The presenters set off on a journey from the city of Gondar to the Afar Triangle, a place thought to be the birthplace of humankind. On their way, Freddie revealed that his Porsche wasn't in the best mechanical condition, with a faulty roof, overheating and clutch issues, while Paddy and Chris were pleased with their choices. The first challenge was a compilation of rally-style driving tests done in a quarry where despite cheating from all presenters Chris and Paddy completed the course, with Chris claiming a moral victory over Paddy, while the Boxster failed to complete after getting beached. Mishaps on the way to Dallol included a flat tyre for Paddy and Freddie's Boxster overheating so needing a tow from Paddy. The next challenge was a blindfolded acceleration and braking test, with the aim to be as close to a traffic cone at the end of a runway. Paddy stopped almost next to the cone, amid accusations of cheating, beating Chris & Freddie. At the edge of Afar Triangle, they had to cross the Danakil Depression to reach Dallol. The extreme heat prompted Freddie to cut his Porsche roof off, while Chris suffered a heat stroke and had to stop to recover. The conditions damaged both Freddie and Chris' cars, causing Freddie to lose his extra cooling fans, and Chris had his first mechanical breakdown of the journey. Winner: Paddy = Budget electric sports car = Series Twenty-Seven, Episode Two With electric cars gaining popularity in recent years, the presenters are tasked to build electric sports cars on a budget. Chris bought a Triumph Spitfire that he modified with BMW i3 batteries and electric motor that produced 260 hp. Paddy acquired a Nissan Leaf that he visually modify, while Freddie settles for a Subaru BRAT that had its engine retrofitted with Tesla's electric motor, putting out 500 hp and dubbed \\"Mute\\". Taking place at the disused Ironbridge power stations complex in Telford, their first challenge is a timed lap around the power stations complex. Freddie went first and clocked 1 minute and 10.5 seconds, followed by Paddy who clocked 1 minute and 5 seconds, and Chris who clocked at 1 minute and 8 seconds. Afterwards, they head for the open road and go to Tamworth. However, Paddy's Leaf ran out of range, prompting him to search for someplace to charge his car. Along the way, the presenters managed to find places to charge their cars: Paddy charged his Leaf at a local neighborhood, while Chris and Freddie charged theirs at the local service station; Paddy's method of charging leaving him hours behind schedule. Over at Tamworth, their next challenge is a handling test based on the classic buzz wire children's game at the Daytona Tamworth go kart track, where each presenter will receive electric shock if they nudge the barriers. Paddy went first, followed by Chris and Freddie; the challenge was won by Freddie. Next, they return to Telford to see if their cars can garner enough publicity at the Energy and Rural Business Show, judged by the number of likes received by each presenter. Freddie, being a former athlete, sets a gimmick where he runs on a treadmill to charge his Subaru, while Paddy staged a raffle and Chris went outside to set a small gymkhana course for his Triumph. Paddy won the challenge, scoring 174 likes (dubbed as \\"green smiley faces\\"). After the expo, the presenters make their way to Mansfield. On their way, Freddie revealed that he still kept the BRAT's original petrol engine to beat the range anxiety. Their challenge at the city is an endurance race dubbed \\"24 Minutes of Mansfield\\", putting their electric cars against some of the latest electric cars on sale. Despite his early lead, Paddy only scored 15 laps, fewer than Chris and Freddie's 18 laps respectively; Paddy revealed that all of their cars were outperformed by the much newer rivals. = Cheap, rare cars in Borneo = Series Twenty-Seven, Episode Four Paddy and Freddie are tasked to find cheap and rare cars and report to Borneo to do a series of challenges. Paddy acquired a Matra Bagheera for ¬£6,000, while Freddie bought an Austin Allegro estate for ¬£3,500; Paddy's car was used as press car, featured in the original brochure, and one of four remaining in the UK. They were tasked to go from the local airfield to Brunei \\"until they can drive no more\\". Along the way, the presenters have to navigate arduous jungle terrain, which damaged Paddy's Matra, while Freddie's Austin fared better. By nightfall, their trip was temporarily halted by British Army's Royal Gurkha Rifles' 2nd Battalion, who provided necessary assistance to navigate the jungle to their final destination: presenting their cars before the Sultan of Brunei. During the night, Freddie decided to modify the Austin to better cope with the jungle condition. For the second leg of their journey, Paddy decided to part ways with Freddie and followed a logging track which led his party to a nearby river, using makeshift rafts to transport the Matra through the river; on the other hand, Freddie's party managed to clear the jungle and found smooth tarmac road after Paddy departed for the river. The final leg of the trip is a 40 mile race to Bandar Seri Begawan. While Freddie managed to make good progress through tarmac road, Paddy's river approach puts him closer to the finish line, despite him having to navigate gravel tracks before finding smooth tarmac. While on the highway, Freddie's Austin overheated, giving Paddy an advantage. Despite the setback, Freddie managed to arrive at the palace earlier than Paddy; however, they were declined entry to the palace. Back at the studio, the cars were presented with rainbow colours, in solidarity with the LGBT community following Brunei's recent anti-LGBT laws. Winner: Freddie (after final deliberation by Chris). =Nepal Special= Series Twenty-Eight, Episode Zero The presenters head to Nepal to see what is the best city car for less than ¬£6,000. Paddy bought a Peugeot 106 Rallye for ¬£3,500, Chris a Renault 4 for ¬£5,000, while Freddie chose a local Hulas Mustang for ¬£6,000. They are instructed to drive from Kathmandu to Lo Manthang. While leaving Kathmandu and heading to Pokhara, Paddy got stuck and had to be towed by Freddie, revealing that the Mustang was only two wheel drive. On the way to Jomsom, rough roads damaged both Chris and Paddy's cars to the degree where the Peugeot required garage repairs prompting the presenters to stay the night instead of travelling on. The next morning on the road Paddy's Peugeot got stuck again, once again being towed by Freddie. During a river crossing, both Chris and Paddy got stuck so Freddie had to tow both of them out each time. In order to prepare for the final leg of the journey, the presenters split up: Chris and Freddie went to purchase trekking equipment, while Paddy heads to the local market to buy necessary rations. After this they had to give locals a lift to Muktinath Temple. Freddie some sherpas, Paddy local women, and Chris some holy men. Nearing the temple, the trio decided had a hillclimb challenge, with the finishing line set at the temple's car park. Despite a 30 second head start, Paddy overtook both Chris and Freddie and reached the temple first. From the temple, they resume their journey to Lo Manthang, a distance of 40 miles. At the high altitude the Mustang had to tow the other cars at various times. While trying to start Paddy's car, Chris forgot to apply his handbrake and his car rolled back and tipped over, damaging it beyond repair, meaning he had to car share with Freddie. Both surviving cars made it to Lo Manthang where Paddy's Peugeot passed the city gateway with a very small margin and the Hulas being unable to clear it. Winner: Paddy =Secondhand convertibles for less than ¬£600= Series Twenty-eight, Episode One The presenters are told to buy secondhand convertibles for less than ¬£600 - the average cost of summer holiday in the UK. Paddy bought a Ford Escort Cabriolet for ¬£500, Chris settles in for a Mercedes-Benz SLK which cost ¬£600, while Freddie bought a Chrysler LeBaron for ¬£450. They were told to report to Bognor Regis before heading for Essex for a road trip. Early on their trip, Freddie discovered that his Chrysler has no power steering, which makes matters worse in roundabouts. Their first stop was at Thruxton Circuit for their first challenge: driving around the track against \\"summer holiday traffic\\" before being overtaken by The Stig in a Ford Mustang convertible. Freddie barely got started before retiring due to a puncture, while Paddy managed to survive longer before being overtaken by The Stig. Chris on the other hand, nearly made it to the finish line. They then drove 20 miles to a motocross track for their next challenge: timed lap challenge while their cars are rigged with \\"low friction, synthetic sweat substitute\\" to simulate moist conditions caused by sweating. Paddy, who went first, only managed to do 42 yards before crashing his Escort, Chris managed to do a full lap in 1 minute and 45 seconds, while Freddie completed the course in 1 minute and 48 seconds. Paddy restarted and managed to do the course in 1 minute and 36 seconds. Afterwards, Freddie's Chrysler suffered from overheating issues, forcing Paddy to tow him to their next stop: a driving range. There, the presenters are faced with a test of \\"agility\\": driving around the range and catch as many golf balls as they can in two minutes. Freddie went first, where his Chrysler caught 9 golf balls. Paddy was next, where he managed to catch 38 golf balls. Lastly, it was Chris' turn, where he ended the day with 16 golf balls. The next day, they are met with their next challenge: going through a causeway during high tide, which Paddy managed to do without much trouble. Chris decided to go right after Paddy, but his SLK's engine cut out early on, prompting Freddie to push him for a good part of the challenge, until his Chrysler was beached near the finish line. Freddie admitted that his car was the worst of the three, while he and Chris noted that this was the second time Paddy had won a challenge using a Ford Escort. Winner: Paddy = American road trip in cars costing less than ¬£5,000 = Series Twenty-eight, Episode Three The presenters are told to buy \\"the ultimate American road trip car\\" for less than ¬£5,000 online and meet in Peru, specifically in the city of Cusco. Chris purchased a Dodge Dart, Freddie bought a Volkswagen Bus, while Paddy went for a second-generation Pontiac Firebird that had its roof chopped off. They are tasked to go from Cusco to the Vilcabamba mountains, tracing the road networks made by Inca people. A short while from the start, Paddy and Chris had to deal with their cars' problems: the Pontiac's overheating problems as well as obvious lack of roof and the Dodge's sketchy brakes and barely-functioning wipers. During their trip, the presenters found an empty stretch of road and proceeded to do a drag race; however, Paddy cannot join because his Pontiac's rear axle came loose, much to Chris and Freddie's amusement. The following morning, the presenters continue their trip from Ollantaytambo, now with Paddy managing to acquire a new car: a fourth-generation Oldsmobile Cutlass that he bought from an American car meet the day before. At the local market, the presenters decided to do drive-thru shopping: Chris bought some fruits and vegetables, Freddie purchased a bunch of flowers as his Bus' decoration, while Paddy bought two wooden phalluses. Their next stop after Ollantaytambo is the Abra Malaga mountain pass, where the presenters enjoy the mountain pass' excellent view and smooth road. On their third day, the presenters went for a stop to check the local \\"motorcar cross\\" scene: a dirt track racing involving a three- wheeled motorcycle manned by two people, a rider and a passenger. Chris, being a professional racing driver himself, went first, followed by Paddy and Freddie. Upon leaving the dirt track racing scene, the presenters are faced with a challenge: reach the Abra Yanama mountain pass, notable for being one of the most dangerous roads in the world, having an unpaved surface and located at a height of more than 4,600 meters above sea level. Along the journey, Freddie put his Bus' \\"secret weapon\\" to use: an electrolysis kit installed to the Bus to help supplying the engine with fresh oxygen, supplementing performance, while Paddy and Chris suffered some damages; Chris' Dodge lost its clutch, prompting him to abandon the car, while Paddy's Oldsmobile blew a fuse (causing its horn to ring at times) and had its driver side door removed. Freddie's declared the winner, as his Volkswagen Bus lasted from the start to finish. Winner: Freddie = Written-off performance cars for less than ¬£6,000 = Series Twenty-Nine, Episode Two Considering that insurance write-offs may be a good way to purchase interesting cars on the cheap, the presenters set off to find performance cars that have been written off by insurance companies and meet at the track. Paddy bought a Porsche Cayman S for ¬£5,500, Freddie acquired a Maserati Quattroporte for ¬£5,750, while Chris purchased a Ford Focus RS for ¬£5,000. Their first test is an acceleration test to test for mechanical soundness. Paddy initially took the lead, but he ran out of runway and got himself beached. He managed to reach 141.6 mph, compared to Freddie's 135.8 mph and Chris' 125 mph in the Ford Focus; however, Chris won the challenge as he's the only one who actually stayed on the runway, as dictated by the rules. Next, they have to play a game of musical chairs in a simulated car park to test for low-speed agility against some Toyota Prius driven by The Stig's teenage cousins. Paddy got eliminated first, putting Chris against Freddie all the way to final round, which was won by Freddie; Chris veered off the track after he got nudged by Freddie. Afterwards, the producers said that they should use whatever's left from their ¬£6,000 budget to fix the car and make it road legal. Paddy and Chris managed to mend theirs to full working order, however Freddie chose a different path by stripping his Maserati and dubbing it \\"Mad Max-serati\\". They then head for Alexandra Palace for their next test: reaching 50 mph in the wall of death, with Ken Fox from Ken Fox Wall of Death providing necessary lessons and instructions. Paddy went first, where he clocked 55.72 mph while breaking his Porsche's rear suspension. Next, Chris went in and clocked 54.85 mph, followed by Freddie, who clocked 56.92 mph, however his Maserati was unable to make it to the top of the wall, and lost multiple pieces of the car. = Cheap rental car in Cyprus = Series Twenty-Nine, Episode Three The presenters head to Cyprus to look for cheap rental cars with a budget of ‚Ç¨30 for two days. Paddy hired a Ford Focus cabriolet, Freddie went for a Suzuki Jimny, while Chris rented a Kia Picanto. First, they head to Achna Speedway for a \\"hot lap challenge\\"; lapping the track against \\"local traffic\\" (simulated traffic running in opposite direction) while their cars' cabin is heated. Freddie went first and clocked 3 minutes and 15 seconds, followed by Chris, who clocked 3 minutes and 4 seconds, and Paddy, who went slightly quicker than Chris by three-tenths of a second. Next, they head to the reservoir through gravel roads, where Freddie's Jimny gave him an advantage. Arriving at the reservoirs, the presenters are instructed to do a \\"drag race\\": using their cars to pull a water skier across the lake. Chris went first and clocked 15 mph, followed by Paddy at 3 mph, while Freddie did 12 mph. The following day, they head to Mount Olympus ski resort to receive their next challenge: racing around the ski resort complex to test cold weather performance. Freddie went first, followed by Chris, while Paddy struggled to unhinge the Focus from its chain. After the ski slope challenge, the presenters made their way back to Paphos International Airport to return their cars while having their cars inspected by the rental agent.

Plot The series revolves around Yuto Amakawa, a seemingly ordinary teenager with a troubled past. Seven years ago, his parents died in a car accident, leaving him alone without a single relative. The only item that was left of his family is a strange and mysterious amulet which was given to him by his late grandmother. Ever since then, his childhood friend Rinko Kuzaki (and her parents) has cooked for and taken care of him. His life takes a surprising turn on his 16th birthday when he meets Himari, a cat demon samurai girl. Himari reveals to him that his family and ancestors were part of the twelve Demon Slayer families that have been slaying demons since the feudal era, and that he too is a Demon Slayer. She has sworn an oath from his family to protect Yuto from the various demons that are out to kill him, but Yuto's cat allergies makes the issue much more complicated. Later on, Yuto encounters various other girls who take a liking to him: Shizuku, a mizuchi or water deity in the form of a small child; Lizlet, a tsukumogami or artifact spirit in the form of a busty tea-serving maid; and Kuesu, another Demon Slayer who is revealed to be Yuto's fianc√©e and a person from Yuto's forgotten past. As the series progresses, Yuto and the group encounter some powerful ayakashi, with some of them being allies, and Yuto eventually makes a life-changing decision to fight for his belief of coexistence between human and ayakashi.

As a Grace liner Santa Rita served the New York‚ÄîSouth American West Coast trade from 1929 until 1939. As William Ward Burrows the ship served in the Pacific. From October 1940 she assisted in the buildup of Central Pacific bases, being caught in transit from Hawaii to Wake Island when news of the attack on Pearl Harbor came. She later saw service in the South Pacific and West Pacific. On 29 June 1946 the ship went into reserve at Olympia, Washington until removed for scrapping 18 May 1957. Construction Santa Rita was a twin-screw, steel-hulled, passenger and cargo motorship launched in May 1929 at Copenhagen, Denmark, by Burmeister & Wain built for the Grace Steamship Company, Inc., and operated between New York and ports in South America and on the west coast of the United States, carrying passengers and freight. The ship was the second Grace Line ship of the name and two more would follow. The design was for four passenger decks with accommodations for 80 first and 48 intermediate class passengers in beds rather than berths in all outside rooms. The recreational facilities included a swimming tank, golf practice area along with social hall, smoking room, lounge and verandah cafe. Cargo capacity was 5,100 tons handled by four extra large hatches and nine electric winches. Insulated chambers were provided for carrying of fruit and other perishables. The diesel engines driving the twin screws developed 4,500 horsepower for a service speed of . Commercial service Santa Rita followed Santa Inez in inaugurating Grace Line's service between New York through the Panama Canal to Buenaventura, Colombia and Guayaquil, Ecuador, the first direct passenger service to those ports, with Santa Inez departing on 20 April and Santa Rita due to depart 8 June. The planned run between New York and Buenaventura was eight days and Guayaquil twelve days. After those initial ports the ships were to call at South American West Coast ports as far south as Valparaiso. By September, 1932, declining trading conditions along the run from New York to Peru led to the announcement that the ships operating on the run, Santa Inez, Santa Olivia and Santa Rita, were to be withdrawn and laid up; however, they were put back in service the next year. In 1935 the growth in the fruit trade to the West Coast of South America resulted in fitting five of the line's vessels, including in four compartments for Santa Rita, with York Ice Machinery Corporation refrigeration plants that included a patented system of air circulation developed by United Fruit Company. In mid 1939 Grace Line announced it was trading in Santa Rita and Santa Inez as part payment to the Maritime Commission for two of its new C-2 type cargo ships. The ships were then to be bought by Navy for use as a tender for the Alaska air bases and the other as a survey ship.Santa Inez did become a survey ship. By the time of actual Navy acquisition of Santa Rita the threat of war in the Pacific had resulted in a major effort to develop bases on the mid-Pacific islands linking Hawaii and the Philippines and, as the threat in the Japanese Mandated Islands increased, developed into a South Pacific air ferry route. Santa Rita became quickly involved in those efforts until war actually came, cutting off the central Pacific routes to the Philippines. The replacement was completed 17 September 1941 and delivered to WSA by Grace 23 March 1942 for operation by Grace under an Army Transportation Corps agreement according to the MARAD Vessel Status Card. The ship was torpedoed and sunk 9 July 1942 in the Caribbean. The ship went into the yard for drydock and general repairs at General Engineering & Drydock Company, Oakland, California for refit and was reported there in January and February, 1940 issues of a monthly trade journal.The January issue of the same reference shows the ship in the yard on page 90. A check of the same journal's December, 1939 issue for the same yard does not show the ship. Considering publication dates the January data was probably effective in December. The Navy acquired the ship 9 February at Norfolk, Virginia. Thus the probable West Coast yard period was December, 1939‚ÄîJanuary, 1940. Navy acquisition Santa Rita was purchased by the War Shipping Administration from Grace Lines for $511,513.11 on 6 February 1940 and simultaneously transferred to the Navy. The ship was commissioned \\"in ordinary\\" as transport William Ward Burrows (AP-6) on 9 February at Pier 5 of the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia. Converted to a troop transport at the Norfolk Navy Yard, William Ward Burrows was placed in full commission on 15 May 1940, Comdr. Ross A. Dierdorff in command. Operational service =Pre war= After fitting-out, William Ward Burrows sailed from Norfolk on her maiden voyage on 6 July and proceeded to Weehawken, New Jersey, to take on a cargo of structural steel. Departing that port on the 15th, the transport embarked a company of marines as well as a group of women and children - naval dependents - for transportation to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After delivering her passengers, she touched at San Juan, Puerto Rico; Crist√≥bal, Canal Zone; transited the Panama Canal; visited Balboa, Canal Zone and the California ports of San Diego, San Pedro, Vallejo (the Mare Island Navy Yard); and the Naval Air Station at Alameda, before she proceeded on to her ultimate destination of Midway Island, where she dropped anchor on 2 October. William Ward Burrows began, consequently, what would become a series of voyages that formed part of the belated American attempt to fortify her outposts in the Pacific - islands such as Wake, Midway, and Johnston. William Ward Burrows carried the pioneer construction unit - 80 men and 2,000 tons of equipment - to Wake Island in January 1941, departing Honolulu the day before Christmas of 1940 and arriving at destination late in the afternoon of 9 January 1941. William Ward Burrows would conduct eight more voyages prior to the outbreak of war in the Pacific, carrying construction employees, sailors, and marines, and the miscellaneous cargo necessary to sustain the outposts of the American defense system in the Pacific. On what proved to be her last pre-war voyage to Wake, the transport took westward a cargo of dynamite, as well as employees of civilian contractors and a sprinkling of Navy and Marine Corps personnel. In addition she towed Pan American Airways Barge No. 4, laden with general cargo. She arrived at Wake on 11 November, disembarked her passengers, discharged her cargo, and delivered her tow before she headed back to Hawaii on the 13th. Soon after arriving, she shifted to Honolulu and embarked 33 marines, 60 sailors, and 55 civilian contractor's employees for transport to Wake on the 28th. She got underway at 0825 on 29 November, towing PAB-7. The ship, herself, carried 1,819 tons of cargo - general supplies, lumber, \\"reefer boxes\\" (refrigerators), a boat, 10 trailers, and 20 tons of gasoline in tins. Heavy seas and stormy winds prevailed for the entire passage. William Ward Burrows, nevertheless, plowed along at five knots with PAB-7 in tow; she rendezvoused with on 5 December and took on board an appendicitis patient from the Hawaii bound tug for medical attention. As the transport continued on toward Wake Island, the weather - as Commander Dierdorff observed - was \\"uniformly abominable\\", but all hands took the rough weather well. The ship crossed the international date line on 6 December and accordingly set her calendars ahead to compensate. Unbeknownst to the solitary transport, a Japanese carrier task force was proceeding toward Pearl Harbor. On the morning of 7 December 1941 (8 December on the transport's side of the date line), that task force struck Pearl Harbor a devastating blow and plunged the United States into a war in both oceans. =War= At 0705 on 8 December, William Ward Burrows received word of the attack. The crew was called to general quarters, the captain set air and submarine watches; lookouts were alerted, as were the gun crews. Civilian workmen embarked on board immediately volunteered their services \\"in any capacity.\\" The next day, 9 December, William Ward Burrows received orders to return to Honolulu with her loaded cargo and PAB-7. The war news she received was grim. Pearl Harbor had been attacked and Midway shelled (by the Japanese destroyers Ushio and Akebono). False sightings of Japanese task forces here and there proliferated. Comdr. Dierdorff later recalled: \\"As reports came in, the general impression we gained was that most of the Nipponese fleet was between us and Hawaii.\\" He was not far from the truth. On 13 December, the transport received word to take PAB-7 to Johnston Island. Accordingly, the ship altered course and on 15 December delivered the barge‚Äîwith her cargo load of \\"general cargo\\" and lumber‚Äîand embarked passengers for transportation to Hawaii. That day, at 1340, William Ward Burrows' rudder touched a 3-fathom (5 m) coral head‚Äîin an area believed to have been dredged to a safe depth of 30 feet (5 fm; 9 m). The transport cleared the navigational hazard with only minor damage to the tip of the rudder. That evening, William Ward Burrows remained at anchor to the south of Johnston Island in an anchorage deemed safe from submarine attack. Comdr. Dierdorff posted full submarine lookouts, fully manned the bridge, and put the engine room on five minutes' notice to get underway. Squally weather prevented his using a 40-foot motor launch as picket. At 1810, Ens. J. A. Peterson, USNR - the officer of the deck - sounded the general alarm; when Comdr. Dierdorff reached the bridge, he saw that enemy ships were shelling Johnston Island from the northward, setting fire to oil storage tanks near the center of the island. One large shell struck 30 yards astern of William Ward Burrows, and another passed over the forecastle. Other splashes erupted from the waters between the ship and the island. The enemy did not see William Ward Burrows which was carrying 227 passengers - 132 of them civilians. Knowing that his 3-inch guns were inadequate for a surface gunfire duel with ships of unknown size, Comdr. Dierdorff wisely decided not to open fire. Favored by darkness and rain squalls, William Ward Burrows got underway at 1830 and escaped to the southward. By that time, the bombardment had ceased. At about 2330, Johnston Island reported no casualties and advised William Ward Burrows not to return; thus, early the next morning, the transport set course for Honolulu and home. William Ward Burrows entered drydock on New Year's Day 1942 for repairs to her rudder and nine days later emerged and began loading cargo destined for Midway. After embarking a draft of marines for transportation to that key atoll, the transport got underway on 18 January. She arrived five days later and began working her cargo. Two days later, a Japanese submarine boldly surfaced a mere mile away and began shelling the island. However, about three minutes later, fire from Marine Corps guns ashore drove the submarine away. The ship soon headed back to Pearl Harbor and arrived there on 3 February. Between early February and mid-March, she made two more round-trip voyages to Midway before she conducted an inter-island trip among the islands of the Hawaiian group carrying general cargo and transporting Army troops to Hilo and Maui. She next voyaged to Midway, carrying general cargo, lumber, provisions, \\"reefer boxes\\", cable reels, and a two-ton truck while transporting naval and Marine Corps personnel. In mid-May, she returned to the west coast of the United States. Following an overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, William Ward Burrows loaded to within 90 percent of her capacity, taking on board 1,437 tons of cargo - which included ammunition and lumber - and departed San Francisco at 1053 on 23 July. The transport arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 31st and unloaded. After taking on a different cargo, the ship sailed for the New Hebrides at 1849 on 4 August. After picking up her escort, destroyer , later that day, William Ward Burrows made Fila Harbor, Efate Island, on 17 August. Underway again from Efate on 26 August, this time escorted by destroyer seaplane tender , William Ward Burrows headed for the Solomons. Destroyer minelayers and , and high speed transports , and , as well as SS Kapara joined them the next day. While passing through Indispensable Strait on the 29th, the ships received word from \\"Cactus\\" - the codename for Henderson Field, Guadalcanal - at 1105 that an enemy air raid was imminent. While the APD's and DM's deployed to provide an antiaircraft screen around William Ward Burrows and Kapara, the transport prepared for action. At 1205 - exactly an hour after the alert was broadcast from \\"Cactus\\" - a formation of Japanese planes droned overhead at 25,000 feet. Two minutes later, William Ward Burrows opened fire with her 3-inch battery and expended 50 rounds. Seven minutes later, lookouts observed two enemy bombers falling in flames, due to the fire from the task group. The surviving enemy aircraft soon fled, having caused no damage. Shortly thereafter, William Ward Burrows proceeded to Lunga Roads, off Kukum Point, Guadalcanal, and dropped anchor. She got underway for Tulagi Harbor that afternoon but ran hard aground on the southeast end of Sylvia Reef at 1750, only five minutes after entering the harbor channel. In an effort to get out of the predicament, William Ward Burrows rang down full speed astern at 1752 and attempted to use her stern anchor as a kedge; but the ship refused to budge. Little passed a towline to the transport at 1904, but darkness intervened and kept William Ward Burrows aground for the night. The next day, the transport passed a line to Tracy. The minecraft began pulling, backing with William Ward Burrows' engines running full astern, but the towline parted. Meanwhile, the transport's crew had begun unloading equipment into lighters, in an effort to lighten the ship. At 1458, lookouts spotted 18 Japanese bombers - Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betties\\" - at 22,000 feet. Helplessly aground, William Ward Burrows was in a bad situation; but the Japanese had business elsewhere. They attacked Colhoun at 1512 - after she had unloaded 17 tons of stores consigned to the Marine Corps garrison on Guadalcanal - and, in two minutes, succeeded in scoring four direct hits. The luckless fast transport sank by the stern at about 1515. At 2035, 20 wounded men from Colhoun were brought on board the transport for medical attention. Reflecting later upon the incident, William Ward Burrows' commanding officer, Lt. Comdr. E. I. McQuiston, concluded that, had she not run aground, his ship, too, would have been at Kukum Point and probably would have been the object of the Japanese attack. In that light, perhaps the grounding had been a blessing for the transport. On the morning of the 31st, William Ward Burrows once more ran up her engines at full speed astern in another attempt to free the ship. At 1100, she went to general quarters when she received word of approaching Japanese planes - unable to maneuver and hard aground, the ship was still in a vulnerable position. Again, however, good fortune was with the ship, for the air raid never materialized. Finally, on 2 September, with the aid of patrol craft YP-346 (on the port quarter), YP-239 (on the starboard), and Gamble, William Ward Burrows at last floated free. She remained anchored off Sylvia Reef to take stock of the damage and found it light. Gamble, however, soon reported a submarine in the immediate vicinity, and the transport got underway to seek safety in the inner harbor at Tulagi. However, the ship developed too much way to clear a patch of shoals, and she again grounded - this time on Southern Cross Reef. Again, William Ward Burrows backed engines, but to no avail. Higgins boats pulling on the port quarter and pushing on the starboard side failed to budge her. That time aground was shorter than the first. On the afternoon of 3 September, aided by the trusty Gamble and YP-239, William Ward Burrows pulled free. After being refloated from Southern Cross Reef, the transport again got underway for Kukum Point to discharge part of her cargo. She then proceeded back to Tulagi to unload the remainder. Upon completing that task, she again headed for Kukum Point at 0545 on the 5th; she hove to at 0756 finding all available boats engaged in picking up the survivors from Little and Gregory, APD's that had tangled with a detachment of the \\"Tokyo Express\\" and been sunk by the gunfire of Japanese destroyers Y≈´dachi, Hatsuyuki, and Murakumo on the night of 4 and 5 September. As those boats passed his ship, Comdr. McQuiston invited them to come alongside and transfer the wounded to the transport. William Ward Burrows picked up 27 that morning and an additional 214 later, all for passage to Espiritu Santo. Her task completed at Guadalcanal, William Ward Burrows, escorted by Gamble, got underway at 1858. At 0715 on 8 September, the transport dropped anchor at Segond Channel, Espiritu Santo, and later refueled from oiler . After disembarking the APD survivors and discharging more of her cargo, William Ward Burrows took on passengers and light freight and pushed on independently for New Caledonia on the 12th. Reaching Noumea on the 14th, she continued her voyage through the Pacific war zone to Suva, in the Fiji Islands, in company with US Army Transport Ernest R. Hinds and escorted by destroyer . There, she brought on board more cargo and mail for delivery to Pearl Harbor. Again sailing in company with Ernest R. Hinds and escorted by light cruiser , William Ward Burrows made port at Pearl Harbor on 28 September. She remained at that point until 4 October loading cargo at both the Hickam Field dock and at the Navy Yard. She sailed for the Fiji Islands at 1400 that day, in company with seaplane tender and escorted by destroyer . Upon arrival at Suva on the 15th, the transport worked her cargo and, on the 18th, pushed on for Espiritu Santo where she arrived three days later. Underway for New Caledona on the 27th, William Ward Burrows arrived at Noum√©a the following day and unloaded her passengers and mail. She tarried there until 14 November, when she pushed on for Samoa. Upon arrival, she discharged passengers and mail, picked up other passengers; and then proceeded back to the Hawaiian Islands, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 27 November. The transport made one round-trip voyage to Midway and back before she shifted to the west coast of the United States for her second \\"stateside\\" visit since the war began. Arriving at San Francisco, California, on 2 February 1943, she spent the next few weeks exchanging cargoes and embarking passengers. She sailed for the Hawaiian Islands on 21 February, in company with transport and escorted by destroyers and . The convoy, designated Task Group 15.6, ran into heavy weather on 25 February and for four days fought through mountainous seas. William Ward Burrows occasionally shipped water over both bow and stern and rolled very heavily in the rough seas and heavy swells, but arrived safely at Pearl Harbor on 2 March. The ship devoted most of 1943 to making inter-island transport runs, traveling among the islands of the Central Pacific, especially those of the Hawaiian chain. The most dramatic incident during this period of her service occurred on 6 November as she was approaching Midway toward the end of a run from Pearl Harbor. The ship's steering gear failed, and she was forced to lie to off the channel entrance until repairs could be made. Meanwhile, sub chaser PC-598 stood out of Midway to help protect the transport and joined PC-586 at 1418. At 2034, PC-598 reported picking up a submarine contact. A minute later, the transport went to general quarters. At 2040, PC-598 fired a floating flare to illuminate the area, and she commenced dropping depth charges a minute later. William Ward Burrows - underway off the coast, with PC-586 patrolling ahead - later lost contact with PC-598 as that vessel went off to the hunt. The next morning, with the danger passed and the steering casualty repaired, the transport entered the lagoon and began discharging her cargo. The ship remained at Midway from 8 to 10 November and soon set sail for Pearl Harbor, with PC-586 again as ocean escort. She made one more inter-island cargo- carrying voyage before she began her third run to the South Pacific. Three days before Christmas 1943, William Ward Burrows, escorted by PC-549 and PC-596, departed Pearl Harbor with a cargo of ammunition. She traveled via Palmyra and American Samoa - transferring mail to PC-596 on 30 December to deliver it to the port of Tutuila. The transport ultimately arrived at Havannah Harbor, Efate, at 0847 on 5 January 1944 and moored alongside the battleship . After working cargo on board the battleship between 6 and 11 January, she proceeded to Espiritu Santo, where she discharged cargo between the 13th and 15th. Proceeding thence to Funafuti, in the Ellice Islands, the ship remained at that port for two days before she set her course toward Pearl Harbor and arrived there on 28 January. After repairs, the transport made two more voyages to Midway Island - completing the second on 29 April - before she became the flagship of Service Squadron (ServRon) 12. ServRon 12 - dubbed \\"the harbor stretchers\\" - was a harbor development and salvage unit whose job was to clear harbors in the forward areas, making it possible to berth ships and bring supplies to the front-line areas at the earliest possible moment. Commanded by Capt. (later Commodore) Leon S. Fiske, ServRon 12 would play a part in the stepping-stone advance that eventually carried American forces to the Japanese home islands themselves. Underway on 16 May - in company with store ship , unclassified vessel , and minesweepers , and - William Ward Burrows dropped anchor at Majuro lagoon in the Marshalls, on the 25th. Two days later, she shifted to Kwajalein, where she served into mid-July. The flagship of ServRon 12 departed Kwajalein on 15 July, bound for Eniwetok in company with the survey ship , the former Santa Inez that had been her running-mate and sister ship, escorted by destroyer , for the Marianas. On the 21st, lookouts in the ship sighted starshell and heard the sound of heavy gunfire from Saipan - probably the mopping-up operations by the American forces ashore, since organized Japanese resistance on Saipan had ceased on the 9th. William Ward Burrows passed near Tinian on the 22d, observing from close- hand the preparatory bombardments paving the way for the landing of Major General Harry Schmidt's marines that would follow two days later. Late on the 23d, William Ward Burrows dropped anchor in Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, where she became a base of operations for the harbor development unit and immediately began salvage and harbor development operations, providing water and stores to the various ships assigned to ServRon 12 as well as small craft from other units. Her stay at Saipan was not without incident. On 30 July, shortly after midnight, a tremendous explosion rocked the area; the concussion from the blast blew in the plywood light shields at the William Ward Burrows' hatches facing the island. Japanese infiltrators had detonated a cache of 84 tons of dynamite. Boats from the ship put out to investigate, but could only ascertain that damage to the dump had been done and the guards had disappeared, probably killed in the blast. The following morning, William Ward Burrows disembarked a detachment of four officers and 180 enlisted men of Naval Construction Battalion (NCB) (\\"Seabees\\") 301 to continue harbor development work at Saipan and stood out of Tanapag Harbor, bound for newly conquered Guam in company with cargo ship , landing craft repair ship , LST-431, and escorted by the destroyer and destroyer escort . After a one-day passage, William Ward Burrows dropped anchor at Apra Harbor and began unloading salvage equipment. Soon, various barges and other salvage craft were operating from alongside the transport which supplied them with water and stores as they worked on local harbor development tasks. Commodore William M. Quigley, the new Deputy Commander, Forward Area, and his staff reported aboard on 18 August. The ship's force immediately began constructing a wooden addition to the communication office on the promenade deck, port side. In addition, a voice radio and operations office was built on the port side of the gun deck. These alterations were made to help the ship fill her new role as the ship in which the Senior Officer Present, Afloat, (SOPA) was embarked. William Ward Burrows soon resumed her work as base ship for harbor operations at Apra Harbor. She again supplied various ships and small craft with stores and water, until she detected a leak in one of her fresh water tanks. After patient searching, the ship's force found the affected area and soon repaired it. Shortly thereafter, Commodore Quigley and his staff disembarked and set up shop in the internal combustion engine repair ship . William Ward Burrows next embarked seabees and their equipment and took on board a cargo of dynamite that partially filled one of her holds. She continued the loading evolution until 2 October when she got underway in company with her escort, minesweeper . Soon after they cleared the harbor, the barometer began dropping steadily - a sign of an impending typhoon. The storm developed throughout the night and struck with full force the next morning. William Ward Burrows plunged through the tempest, \\"like a sailboat between two mountains of water\\", as the ships' historian later recounted. During the morning, hands in the transport estimated that the wind velocity was at least 85 knots. William Ward Burrows suffered only little damage - one life raft lost over the side - and she and Caravan continued their voyage. On 4 October, they joined survey ship , floating dry dock ARD-16, and fleet ocean tug . Altering course toward Ulithi Atoll, William Ward Burrows effected the necessary minor repairs to the storm damage suffered in the typhoon before she again got underway on 9 October, bound for her original destination, the Palaus. She hove to off Peleliu and unloaded her cargo into amphibious trucks (DUKW's) and her dynamite cargo into an LCT. Five days after her arrival, William Ward Burrows shifted to a position between the islands of Bairakaseru and Garakayo, where she lay to, while a survey boat from NCB-301 took soundings of a nearby inlet in preparation for anchoring ARD-16. The transport eventually moved to a spot between Angaur and Peleliu and hove to for the night. During her stay in the Palaus, several air alerts occurred, giving all hands some anxious hours; but the transport never sighted any enemy aircraft and continued her support duties, transferring navigational gear and buoys to Coast Guard seagoing buoy tender . Departing Peleliu on 23 October, William Ward Burrows headed back to the Marianas to resume her flagship duties for ServRon 12. En route, Caravan - again her ocean escort - made a contact on what she believed was an enemy submarine and made one attack. However, she lost the contact and eventually rejoined her charge and shepherded the transport safely back to Guam. William Ward Burrows operated at Guam into the spring of 1945. Getting underway for the Ryukyus on 30 May, in the wake of the invasion of Okinawa, William Ward Burrows - escorted by minesweeper - reached that island on 3 June and entered Buckner Bay. As she steamed to her assigned anchorage, the transport came under attack from a solitary \\"Jill\\" that roared down out of the clouds. Immediately, the ships in the anchorage blanketed the sky with antiaircraft fire and sent the \\"Jill\\" crashing about 1,000 yards from Burrows' anchorage. This proved to be only the first of almost continuous air raid \\"flash\\" alerts that would characterize the ship's sojourn in Okinawan waters. Five days later, she observed a kamikaze crash the destroyer minelayer , four miles away. At 1908 on 11 June, the transport - at general quarters and \\"on the lookout for low-flying bogies\\" - sighted a \\"Jill\\" or \\"Sonia\\" off her port side at 1,500 feet. The transport and all of the other ships in the area immediately opened fire, \\"engulfing the plane and vicinity with tracer fire and shell bursts.\\" The plane roared past William Ward Burrows, Bowditch, an LSD, and a Liberty ship, making a banking turn over the nearby Katsuren Hanto peninsula, and crashed at 1911, about 700 yards astern of Burrows. The following day, the transport moved to the Yonabaru anchorage and began unloading equipment for the Seabee unit that had begun to establish camps on the beach. Air alerts continued almost ceaselessly, day or night, but unloading operations proceeded regardless. After that period of work offshore, William Ward Burrows got underway and proceeded to Chimu Wan, an anchorage on the northward side of Buckner Bay, and dropped anchor there on 2 July. However, twice after the ship reached that body of water, typhoons nearby forced her to get underway to seek maneuvering room in the open sea. On 19 July, for example, she sortied with LST group 35 - 16 LST's and two LCM's - and remained at sea until the morning of the 21st. Air alerts, too, continued to make life hectic almost until the end, but Japan - worn down by ceaseless Allied pressure, particularly from American seapower - indicated a willingness to surrender and accepted the terms of the Potsdam Declaration on 15 August. =War's end and deactivation= But for William Ward Burrows, however, the cessation of hostilities did not mean an end to the ship's work. The veteran transport participated in the occupation of the erstwhile enemy's homeland, continuing her vital support role between 2 September 1945 and 26 January 1946. During that time, she successfully weathered another major typhoon in September 1945 without suffering major damage. Her task completed in the Far East, William Ward Burrows sailed for the United States in the spring of 1946. She reported to Commandant, 13th Naval District, for disposition on 17 March 1946 and was decommissioned on 16 May of the same year. Struck from the Navy list on 15 August 1946. William Ward Burrows received four battle stars for her World War II service. Lay up and disposal On 29 June 1946 the ship, declared surplus, was delivered at Olympia, Washington to the War Shipping Administration and simultaneously delivered to the Maritime Commission reserve fleet for lay up. On 30 April 1957, after first bids were rejected as too low, the ship was sold to National Metal & Steel Corporation for $111,887.87 and withdrawn from the reserve fleet by the purchaser 18 May 1957 for scrapping.

It is endemic to some areas in the southern, driest part of the Alicante province (where it is called cantahueso or cantueso both in Spanish and Valencian) along with some isolated and similarly subarid locations in the contiguous Regi√≥n de Murcia (Spain). Thymus moroderi must not be confused with the somewhat similar in appearance (yet from the genus Lavandula) Lavandula stoechas, which is also called cantueso in Spanish. When not blooming, thymus moroderi is an inconspicuous, dark green plant with tiny leaves and an overall modest appearance. Its typical size is small, with mature specimens reaching in optimal conditions a radius of some 25 cm, and approximately 20 cm height. It blooms from April through early June; during these weeks, its normally dull appearance changes dramatically by virtue of its conspicuous flowers. Thymus moroderi is a xerophyte plant which thrives in areas with a total annual precipitation of 300mm and less, as recorded in the southern part of the Alicante province and contiguous areas in Murcia. It also shows a preference for otherwise extremely poor soils, especially those showing traces of gypsum. Despite Thymus moroderi not being listed in any endangered species collection, arguably it is not a common species because of its patchy distribution, often being present within areas densely populated, with the risk of flower picking for traditional usages (which, despite recommendations to only trim the plant, some may still carry out by uprooting it completely). Popular uses Cantueso, a traditional local liquor, is distilled from the plant. Besides, mostly around the city of Elche the flowers of Thymus moroderi are traditionally picked and then desiccated for ready consumption through the year as a stomach herbal tonic, which is brewed as herbal tea. Since 2013 different trials have been started in order to domesticate the species, so to allow commercial cultivation. Besides the traditional ones, other potential usages being considered are connected to its essential oil and ornamental qualities.

During this period, Stockholm still didn't fill up the small island Stadsholmen (the \\"city islet\\") which today known as the Stockholm Old Town (Gamla stan), and as a consequence this article to some extent overlap Gamla stan.  Foundation and initial growth  Seal of Stockholm known from an imprint from 1296; most likely the city's first seal mentioned in a letter from 1281.Hall, p 21 The origin of Stockholm pre-dates its written history and how and why the city evolved in the mid-13th century is still disputed. However, even though events during the 1250s and 1260s remain diffuse, if nothing else, the amount of surviving documents, such as letters and diaries, seem to indicate Stockholm rapidly grew to become the largest city in Sweden during the late 1270s and throughout the 1280s. It is still disputed whether this development was a planned process initiated by the king and German merchants, or a rather spontaneous growth. The lack of the perpendicular city plans and uniformly-sized blocks common in contemporary cities in Germany and Poland, seem to corroborate the latter.Hall, p 43 It's reasonable to assume, Birger jarl's primary interest when founding Stockholm, not only was to strengthen his own domestic and international position, but that he was also aiming at a general economic expansion. As Sweden just had experienced more than 50 years of continuous warfare between rivalling political parties, it was at this time hardly able to produce the economical resources required to build an entire city. Furthermore, Sweden could not yet present a single city in the continental sense of the word, and it therefore seem unreasonable to assume the king could have been able to build a city from scratch by himself. He did, however, achieve an agreement with L√ºbeck where he invited Germans to settle in Sweden as Swedes and promised them generous benefits if they did. While no surviving document can confirm Stockholm was found, planned and built by Germans, their increasing presence in Swedish historical records coincide with the development of mining in Sweden. So, whether Birger jarl truly is the founder of Stockholm or not, its initial growth undoubtedly starts with him.Hall, p 46 The economic breakthrough, however, appear to have come during the end of the 13th century under the leadership of Magnus Ladul√•s (1275‚Äì90). Magnus not only strengthened the relations with L√ºbeck and the Hanseatic League but also increased Swedish influence over Gotland and Visby and stabilized the administration. During his reign several trade centres were granted city privileges and, notwithstanding the word capital probably didn't exist in his vocabulary, he made Stockholm the de facto political centre and royal residence. The castle and the protection it could offer, initiated by Birger jarl, was the prerequisite to create a medieval city of continental standard, but the organisation and financial strength to produce it came with Magnus. An example of this is the city wall. A large-scale enterprise of this magnitude could hardly have been produced by the burghers of the newly established city, and, as it is first mentioned in 1288, it must have been one of the project Magnus organized.Hall, p 47 The plague disaster known as the Black Death is likely to have taken place in the late summer of 1350. Janken Myrdal: Digerd√∂den, pestv√•gor och √∂del√§ggelse. Ett perspektiv p√• senmedeltidens Sverige The rivalry between the Swedish and German population in the 1380s eventually lead to a massacre on the Swedes, the K√§pplinge murders, performed by the German H√§ttebr√∂der.H√§ttebr√∂der i Nordisk familjebok (f√∂rsta upplagan, 1884)  Kalmar Union  Sten Sture the Elder enters Stockholm. Painting by Georg von Rosen, 1864. During the turbulent closing era of the Swedish Middle Ages, controlling Stockholm and its castle became crucial to anyone aspiring to rule the kingdom, and the city was therefore repeatedly subject to lengthy blockades and occasionally besieged by various Swedish- Danish fractions disputing the Kalmar Union. In 1471, Sten Sture the Elder defeated Christian I of Denmark at the Battle of Brunkeberg only to lose the city to Hans of Denmark in 1497. Sten Sture managed to size power again in 1501 which resulted in a Danish blockade lasting 1502-1509 and eventually a short peace. Hans' son Christian II of Denmark continued the ambitions of his father and made failed attempts to conquer the city in 1517 and 1518, to finally besiege it and force Queen Christina Gyllenstierna leading the resistance to capitulate in 1520. In November the same year, archbishop Gustav Trolle crowned his allied Christian King of Sweden and together they had their common enemies, nobles and burghers of Stockholm, beheaded during the so- called Stockholm Bloodbath. When King Gustav Vasa finally besieged and conquered the city three years later, an event which ended the Kalmar Union and the Swedish Middle Ages, he noted every second building in the city was abandoned.Nilsson, pp 59-63  Population  During the late Middle Ages, most buildings were made of brick, which gave the city its character. Some prominent fa√ßades were, however, painted red to accentuate their importance ‚Äî like the restored fa√ßade of 5, Stora Gr√•munkegr√§nd, also featuring several other aesthetic details.Hall, p. 40 By the end of the 15th century, the population in Stockholm can be estimated to 5-7.000 people, which made it a relatively small town compared to several other contemporary cities, even in a medieval context. (Hamburg and Bremen ~20.000, L√ºbeck 25.000, K√∂ln and London 50.000, and Paris 100.000.) On the other hand, among the approximately forty cities in the Swedish kingdom, the second largest must have been either Kalmar or √Öbo, none of which can have been a home to more than 1-2.000 inhabitants. Of course, these estimations are very unreliable as there was no census in the modern sense, only tax rolls (skotteb√∂cker) enlisting individuals liable to taxation. For example, it is well-known trade was dominated by Germans, and these tax rolls seem to indicate one third of the city's tax-paying population were Germans, most originating from L√ºbeck, Danzig, and Westphalia. They were, however, most likely over-represented in these records as they formed an elite in the city centred on the southern square J√§rntorget, while Finns, also believed to have been numerous in the city, are hard to discern in these records, especially as they often took Swedish names (i.e. Bengt instead of Pentti), but also because they in general had simpler duties and didn't necessarily pay taxes. Furthermore, it is generally assumed no European city managed to reproduce its own population before the early 19th century and thus was dependent of people moving in. Considering medieval warfare and epidemics, the population must have fluctuated considerably.Nilsson, pp 24-27  Trade  An old crane still hanging over the J√§rntorget square reminds of the lively medieval marketplace. During the Middle Ages, export was administered mostly by German merchants who also dominated among the merchants in the city. Most of the merchants were living by or near the squares Kornhamnstorg (\\"Corn Harbour Square\\") and J√§rntorget (\\"Iron Square\\") on the southern corner of the city. Regional peasantry supplied the city with food and raw materials, while the craftsmen in the city produced handicrafts, most of them living by the central square Stortorget or by the oldest two streets in Stockholm, the names of which still reflects their trade: K√∂pmangatan (\\"Merchant's Street\\") and Skomakargatan (\\"Shoemaker's Street\\") in the central part of the city. Fishermen and carpenters dominated on the eastern waterfront, except the southern stretch which was located near the so-called \\"Cog Harbour\\" (Koggahamnen) were the merchants' large sea-going ships were moored. In the western part of the city, along the thoroughfare V√§sterl√•nggatan, lived a heterogeneous group of craftsmen, including butcher, smiths of all sorts, carpenters, bakers, etcetera ‚Äî in short, it was the industrial city district.Nilsson, pp 43-47 The northern part of the island was occupied by the royal castle. A tax roll from 1460 enlists two groups of craftsmen identified by name; on one side 43 carpenters, 40 fishermen, 25 shoemakers, and 24 tailors ‚Äî approximately 35 per cent of the population liable to taxation ‚Äî and on the other side 17 master masons, 8 meat costermongers, 8 bakers, 8 brewers, and 7 butchers. Of course, countless other men worked in the city but failed to reach into the tax rolls. The same tax roll mentions 13 women with a profession: 4 brewers, 1 tailor, 1 brawn-maker, 1 bagpipe-maker, 2 seamstress, 3 weavers, and 1 blood-letter. Lastly a group of 150 women not given a title appear in the records, but their intimate names was hardly meant to deny they were prostitutes: Anna svandunet \\"the swan-down\\", Birgitta r√∂dnacka (\\"red- neck\\"). Katarina papegojan (\\"the parrot\\"). The most important crafts were organised in guilds intended both to guarantee the quality of items produced and ensure prices were favourable to the craftsmen.

While Newton's influential contributions were primarily in physics and mathematics, his broad conception of the universe as being governed by rational and understandable laws laid the foundation for many strands of Enlightenment thought. Newtonianism became an influential intellectual program that applied Newton's principles in many avenues of inquiry, laying the groundwork for modern science (both the natural and social sciences), in addition to influencing philosophy, political thought and theology.  Background  Newton's Principia Mathematica, published by the Royal Society in 1687 but not available widely and in English until after his death, is the text generally cited as revolutionary or otherwise radical in the development of science. The three books of Principia, considered a seminal text in mathematics and physics, are notable for their rejection of hypotheses in favor of inductive and deductive reasoning based on a set of definitions and axioms. This method may be contrasted to the Cartesian method of deduction based on sequential logical reasoning, and showed the efficacy of applying mathematical analysis as a means of making discoveries about the natural world. Newton's other seminal work was Opticks, printed in 1704 in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, of which he became president in 1703. The treatise, which features his now famous work on the composition and dispersion of sunlight, is often cited as an example of how to analyze difficult questions via quantitative experimentation. Even so, the work was not considered revolutionary in Newton's time. One hundred years later, however, Thomas Young would describe Newton's observations in Opticks as \\"yet unrivalled... they only rise in our estimation as we compare them with later attempts to improve on them.\\"  Mathematical philosophy  The first edition of Principia features proposals about the movements of celestial bodies which Newton initially calls \\"hypotheses\\"‚Äîhowever, by the second edition, the word \\"hypothesis\\" was replaced by the word \\"rule\\", and Newton had added to the footnotes the following statement: > ... I frame no hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is > to be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, > whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental > philosophy. Newton's work and the philosophy that enshrines it are based on mathematical empiricism, which is the idea that mathematical and physical laws may be revealed in the real world via experimentation and observation. It is important to note, however, that Newton's empiricism is balanced against an adherence to an exact mathematical system, and that in many cases the \\"observed phenomena\\" upon which Newton built his theories were actually based on mathematical models, which were representative but not identical to the natural phenomena they described. Newtonian doctrine can be contrasted with several alternative sets of principles and methods such as Cartesianism, Leibnizianism and Wolffianism.  Newton's other beliefs  Despite his reputation for empiricism in historical and scientific circles, Newton was deeply religious and believed in the literal truth of Scripture, taking the story of Genesis to be Moses' eyewitness account of the creation of the solar system. Newton reconciled his beliefs by adopting the idea that the Christian God set in place at the beginning of time the \\"mechanical\\" laws of nature, but retained the power to enter and alter that mechanism at any time. Newton further believed that the preservation of nature was in itself an act of God, stating that \\"a continual miracle is needed to prevent the Sun and fixed stars from rushing together through Gravity\\".  Popularization  Portrait of French physicist and Newtonian √âmilie du Ch√¢telet Between 1726 and 1729, French author, philosopher, and historian Voltaire was exiled in England, where he met several English scholars and devotees to the Newtonian system of thought. Voltaire would later bring these ideas back to France with his publication of Lettres Philosophiques and Philosophie de Newton, which popularized Newton's intellectual practices and general philosophy. Later, prominent natural philosopher and friend of Voltaire, √âmilie du Ch√¢telet, would publish a French translation of Principia, which met with great success in France. While Newton was opposed by some members of the religious community for his non-Trinitarian beliefs about God, others believed science itself to be a philosophical exercise, that if done correctly, would lead its practitioners to a greater knowledge and appreciation of God. In 1737, Italian scholar Count Frencesco Algarotti published a book entitled Newtonianismo per le dame overro dialoghi sopre la luce e i colori, which aimed to introduce female audiences to the work of Newton. The text explained the principles of Newton's Opticks while avoiding much of the mathematical rigor of the work in favor of a more \\"agreeable\\" text. The book was later published with a title that made no reference to women, leading some to believe that the female branding of the book was a ploy to avoid censorship.  Influence on other scholars  Scottish philosopher David Hume, likely inspired by the methods of analysis and synthesis which Newton developed in Opticks, was a strong adherent of Newtonian empiricism in his studies of moral phenomena. Newton and his philosophy of Newtonianism arguably led to the popularization of science in Europe‚Äîparticularly in England, France, and Germany‚Äîcatalyzing the Age of Enlightenment.

In 1705 - Hardy Petit de la Guierche is, without a doubt, the origin of the marquisate of the castle. Alexis-Henry Petit is the only child of Marie and Hardy Petit. In a power of homage that he made to the Chamber of Accounts of Paris in 1717, he declared to possess the Marquisate of Saint-Mesmin. From 1755, until the French Revolution - Vasselot family.

About forty Vend√©ens led by Louis P√©ault, sergeant, gamekeeper of the Marquisate of Saint-Mesmin, attack a Republican detachment comprising 250 men commanded by Adjutant General Cortez. Following a counterattack, Cortez tries to surround the Vendeans who retreat to the castle of Saint-Mesmin where they lock themselves to resist. From 21 to 24 February, the assaults of the Republican troops are without conclusive results. But for lack of food, the Vendeans agree to surrender. They are promised lives saved. The forty or so Vendeans were taken to la Chataigneraie, where the chief of staff ordered Bonnaire to assemble a military council to try them and shoot them, despite the promise of life saved. General Hoche, commander-in-chief of the Western troops, warned of the incident, demanded and obtained from his subordinates the respect of the terms of the surrender. The Vendeans were then directed to Fontenay-le-Comte, then to Noirmoutier where they remained until the end of the war.

Demography In 2008, 240 inhabitants were living in Faymoreau, 10% less than in 1999. The commune was ranked 24,953th nationally whereas it was ranked 22,623th in 1999 and 277th in the departmental rank, out of 282 communes. The numbers of inhabitants is taken thanks to a census of the population every five years, as it is done since the beginning of the 21st century in every French commune of less than 10,000 inhabitants. The last one for Faymoreau was taken in 2012, and any other numbers given (2006, 2008) are only projections. Because of mining activities (coal/charcoal) in the 19th century, Faymoreau once reached the number of 1,190 inhabitants in 1876. A record accounted for a strong immigration of polish mineworkers which is explained by the strong activity of the commune at the time. Puy de Serre, a neighbouring commune, was, between 1823 and 1883 part of Faymoreau, inflating logically the amount of inhabitants. Population pyramid The population of the commune is relatively old, despite the presence of a nursery school. Indeed, 36% of the people are over 60, which is way higher than the national rate (about 21%) and the departemental rate (barely 25%). It is good to know that 52.5% of the inhabitants of the village are women, which fits the national average of 51.6%. In recent years, a young population emerged, and now represents approximately 18% of the commune's population. However, the biggest age bracket is still represented by the men and women between 60 and 74 years old, making up a good quarter of the inhabitants of the commune. Regarding the youth of the village, the nursery school, mentioned earlier, is welcoming an average of 18 pupils per year, with regular ups and downs. Once the nursery school is over for these children, they can continue their education in the neighbouring village Puy de Serre, where a primary school is located. We can note that the nursery school welcomes all children of the group of neighbouring villages, Faymoreau, Puy de Serre and Marillet. Places and monuments to visit * The \\"Mining Centre\\", \\"Centre Minier\\" in French, a location made up of a museum, \\"Le Mus√©e de La Mine\\" taking you through the history of the charcoal mine of Faymoreau. * The mining village and its chapel (19th century) of which its stained glass windows were rebuilt by Carmelo Zagari as a tribute to the underground workers (it was a public order in 2001). * The flood barrier, an actual pond were anyone is welcome to fish for a little amount of money. * \\"L'H√¥tel des Mines\\", the restaurant of the village which used to be an actual hotel but only remained a restaurant and a bar. * The market town, the main entrance of the village in some sort, which contains the church of the village, the church of Saint Louis (built in 1883, not to mix up with the chapel though they have been built in the same century), the church of Saint Louis, actually in renovation (of the outward appearance and of the church tower), and this until 2013‚Äì14. * The forests, mostly private properties, can though be crossed, as many campaign roads of the market town pass through them. * Also, one can rest and spend holidays in the commune as \\"g√Ætes\\" and \\"chambres d'h√¥tes\\" opened in the last decade and are available for rent in the spring and summer months. The Mine The Faymoreau mine was a charcoal mine. Basically, it was a coal deposit discovered by chance in 1827 by a clog-maker. This vein will soon become a real mine, as other lodes were found out, attracting miners from the entire region, but also from different parts of Europe as the mine was offering a lot of job offers. Thus for more than a century, French, Polish and Italian miners will cohabit in the mine and live split-up in the mining village. This mine will be the main economic interest of the village, until its closing in 1958. Nowadays, the museum of the mine relates its story, describing its growth, its special events and accidents and its fall, but also the miners' condition at work.

According to the Irish annals, he was High King of Ireland. Sons of √Åed Sl√°ine Peoples and kingdoms in early Ireland. Diarmait's father √Åed Sl√°ine was a son of Diarmait mac Cerbaill, the apical ancestor of the southern branches of the U√≠ N√©ill kindred which dominated Ireland from the late 6th century until the rise of Brian B√≥ruma in the late 10th century. The descendants of √Åed Sl√°ine were known as the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine. With the possible exception of √ìengus mac Colm√°in, all U√≠ N√©ill kings descended from Diarmait mac Cerbaill belonged to the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine until the death of Cin√°ed mac √çrgalaig in 728. The S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine were Kings of Brega, and the Hill of Tara, where High Kings were inaugurated, lay within their lands. Other groups descended from the sons of Diarmait included Clann Cholm√°in, or more precisely Clann Cholm√°in M√°r, descended from Colm√°n M√°r, which replaced the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine as the dominant group of the southern U√≠ N√©ill from the middle of the 8th century, and the less important Ca√≠lle Follamain or Clann Cholm√°in Bicc, descended from Colm√°n Beg. √Åed Sl√°ine himself is said to have been High King jointly with Colm√°n R√≠mid of the northern Cen√©l nE√≥gain branch of the U√≠ N√©ill, following the death of √Åed mac Ainmuirech. √Åed Sl√°ine died circa 604, a death said to have been prophesied by Saint Columba. √Åed's sons are said to have included Diarmait, Blathmac (died 665), Congal (died 634), Ailill (died 634), and D√∫nchad (died 659). Domnall mac √Åedo and Congal C√°ech Diarmait was one of the younger sons of √Åed Sl√°ine. According to king lists, the kingship of Brega was held by Congal and then by Ailill, both killed by Conall Guthbinn mac Suibni of Clann Cholm√°in in 634, after which Diarmait and his brother Blathmac were jointly kings of Brega. Diarmait killed Conall Guthbinn mac Suibni \\"in the house of Nad- Fra√≠ch's son\\" according to the Annals of Ulster, in 635. That same year Diarmait defeated Clann Cholm√°in Bicc in battle at C√∫il Cael√°in where √ìengus mac Colm√°in's son M√°el Umai was killed. At this time the High Kingship of Ireland may have been disputed between Domnall mac √Åedo of the northern Cen√©l Conaill branch of the U√≠ N√©ill and the cruithne king Congal C√°ech. In this complicated contest Diarmait and Blathmac were allied with Domnall. They fought alongside him at the Battle of Mag Rath where Congal was killed. Some branches of the U√≠ N√©ill fought against Domnall and Diarmait's foster-father Lommainnech is said to have killed Conall mac Suibni's son Airmedach in the battle. High King The compilers of the various Irish annals were apparently uncertain as to the succession following the death of Domnall mac √Åedo in 642. The Annals of Ulster state: > Here it is uncertain who reigned after Domnall. Some historiographers state > that four kings, i.e. Cellach, Conall C√≥el, and two sons of Aed Sl√°ine son > of Diarmait son of Fergus Cerrb√©l son of Conall of Cremthann son of Niall > No√≠giallach, namely Diarmait and Blathmac, reigned in mingled rule. According to the late 7th century Baile Chuind Ch√©tchathaig, a list of High Kings composed in the reign of Diarmait's nephew F√≠nsnechta Fledach, son of D√∫nchad, Domnall mac √Åedo was succeeded by Diarmait and Blathmac. The Baile Chuind omits several kings, including √Åed Sl√°ine, some of which may be copying errors, but others are apparently deliberate. It is a work of dynastic propaganda, its purpose to demonstrate that the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine should by right be High Kings of Ireland. For these reasons, although it is the most nearly contemporary witness, it is not necessarily to be trusted. Of the two or four kings, Diarmait was the most active according to the record which survives in the Irish annals. In 649, he defeated Guaire Aidne mac Colm√°in, king of Connacht, at the battle of Carn Conaill. The verse Cath Cairnd Chonaill purports to describe the battle and its context. It states that the king of Munster was present as an ally of Guaire, but this is late and unreliable evidence. In 654, Diarmait killed Conall C√≥el and Cellach died in 658. A plague arrived in Ireland in 664, called the buide Chonaill. The annals record that Diarmait and his brother Blathmac both died of the disease the following year. The king lists have them followed by Blathmac's son Sechnassach, possibly ruling jointly with another son of Blathmac, Cenn F√°elad. Descendants and posterity Diarmait's descendants formed the U√≠ Chernaig branch of the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine, named for Diarmait's son Cernach. The centre of their power lay around Loch Gabhair in modern County Meath. Few of Diarmait's descendants were major figures in Irish history. His grandson Conall mac Cernaig, usually called Conall Grant, was an important figure in the 710s, and a great-grandson, Fogartach mac N√©ill, was later High King. For editors and creators of Middle Irish language literature, the reign of Diarmait and Blathmac was imagined as a Golden Age. Works set in this period include the Cath Cairnd Chonaill and the Sc√©la Cano meic Gartn√°in.

Carr, Barbara Irene Veronica Comyns (1907‚Äì1992). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ‚Äì 14 July 1992), known as Barbara Comyns, was an English writer and artist.  Early life  Born in Bidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire, to Margaret Eva Mary (n√©e Fenn) and Albert Edward Bayley, Comyns was the fourth of six children. The family home was Bell Court, a manor on the banks of the River Avon. Her father was a Birmingham brewer and industrialist who died in 1922 when she was 15.  Artist  After her father's death, Bell Court was sold and Comyns left to attend art school, first in nearby Stratford-upon- Avon, then she moved to London to attend Heatherley School of Fine Art. In 1931 she married fellow artist and childhood friend John Pemberton, nephew of the London Group president and noted artist Rupert Lee. Comyns and her husband exhibited their work with the London Group of artists in November 1934.Wilcox, Denys J. The London Group 1913-1939, the Artists and their Works Comyns mixed amongst the artistic community of London and she knew Dylan Thomas and Augustus John. They had two children (a son, Julian, and a daughter, Caroline), but the marriage broke down around 1935. During the late 1930s, Comyns began a relationship with the black marketeer Arthur Price. The couple lived with Comyns's two children at various London addresses. Comyns generated money by modelling, converting houses into apartments, breeding poodles, renovating pianos, dealing in antique furniture and classic cars and drawing for commercial advertisements. With the outbreak of World War II, Comyns's poverty increased and her relationship with Arthur broke down. Comyns became a cook in a Hertfordshire country house, where she wrote a series of vignettes about her childhood.  Writer  Comyns returned to London with her family in 1942. During the war, she met Richard Strettell Comyns Carr (the son of the barrister and Liberal MP Arthur Strettell Comyns Carr and the grandson of the dramatist Joseph Comyns Carr). Richard was employed in MI6's Section Five (the Spain and Portugal section) with Kim Philby and Graham Greene. They married in 1945. During their honeymoon, Comyns conceived the idea for The Vet's Daughter in a dream and wrote an outline. While Comyns was writing Our Spoons Came from Woolworths, a friend found the manuscript she had written in Hertfordshire and encouraged her to publish it. Five of the stories were published in Lilliput between May 1945 and August 1946 as extracts from \\"the novel nobody will publish\\", with the manuscript later published in whole as Sisters by a River in 1947 by Eyre & Spottiswoode while Graham Greene was director there under Douglas Jerrold. Both Lilliput and Eyre & Spottiswoode left her non-standard spelling intact. Her second novel, Our Spoons Came from Woolworths, was accepted for publishing at the same time as her first. Greene later described her to Max Reinhardt as \\"a crazy but interesting novelist whom I started when I was at Eyre & Spottiswoode but whom Jerrold abandoned with all my other authors [...] when I left\\". After reading about the 1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning, Comyns wrote her third novel, Who Was Changed and Who Was Dead. In 1956, Richard was laid off due to his association with Kim Philby. The Comyns Carrs moved to Spain and lived briefly on Ibiza until 1958 and then in Barcelona, from where she published The Vet's Daughter; Out of the Red, Into the Blue; The Skin Chairs; Birds in Tiny Cages; and A Touch of Mistletoe. These were published through Heinemann, via a recommendation from Greene to his friend A. S. Frere, the managing editor there. In 1969, after Frere had left Heinemann's, an early version of The House of Dolls was turned down by the publisher. Greene did not like it either. Discouraged, Comyns chose not to send it to other publishers. After living in Barcelona for 16 years, they moved to San Roque in Andalusia. In 1974, with increasing inflation in Spain and a decline in the pound, the couple returned to England, moving first to Twickenham, and later, Richmond. The Vet's Daughter was serialized in BBC radio and adapted into the 1978 musical The Clapham Wonder by Sandy Wilson. There was renewed interest in her work when Virago began to reprint some of her novels in the 1980s, based on a recommendation from Greene to Carmen Callil. In the 1980s, Comyns published three more novels: The Juniper Tree, Mr. Fox (an old manuscript based on her relationship with Arthur Price and associated experiences), and The House of Dolls.  Death and legacy  Comyns died in Stanton upon Hine Heath in 1992. She is buried in St. Andrew's Churchyard. The Times, The Independent and The Guardian carried obituaries of her life.

Huber seemed confused and ashamed after this (so it was told on the day of the actual race, and following his retirement the Austrian team could only start with three racers).

The song was recorded at Columbia's Studio A, Nashville, on November 29, 1967.  Structure and instrumentation  The song's instrumentation is light, a characteristic shared with the rest of John Wesley Harding. It features a repetitive descending bass line that carries the song, and the most prominent instrument used is Bob Dylan's acoustic guitar.  Lyrics  The lyrics have their origins in the Bible. In his book, Wicked Messenger: Bob Dylan and the 1960s, Mike Marqusee writes: Dylan was studying the Bible at the time, and he used many biblical reference in the songs on the John Wesley Harding album.Gill, 1998, My Back Pages, p. 127. His mother, Beatty Zimmerman, revealed in an interview at this time: The song revolves around a character, a \\"wicked messenger\\", who has been sent by Eli, a priest in the Books of Samuel. For the critic Andy Gill, \\"this eponymous messenger is, of course, Dylan himself, the bringer of harsh truths\\".Gill, 1998, My Back Pages, p. 134. The lyrics are somewhat opaque (\\"When questioned who had sent for him/He answered with his thumb/For his tongue it could not speak but only flatter\\"), and the song ends with a sardonic, slightly cryptic moral, \\"And he was told but these few words/Which opened up his heart/\\"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any\\" Lyrics for \\"Wicked Messenger\\" perhaps a reference to 2 Samuel 4:10. Gill's interpretation of the song is that the high priest Eli was one of the more intellectual figures in the Old Testament. To have been sent by Eli implies a reliance on intellect. Gill suggests that \\"perhaps Dylan felt he had valued rationality too highly over spirituality.\\"Gill, 1998, My Back Pages, p. 135.

Israel is a major exporter of fresh produce and a world- leader in agricultural technologies despite the fact that the geography of the country is not naturally conducive to agriculture. More than half of the land area is desert, and the climate and lack of water resources do not favor farming. Only 20% of the land area is naturally arable.periurban.html Palestine Peri-urban Agriculture In 2008 agriculture represented 2.5% of total GDP and 3.6% of exports. While farmworkers made up only 3.7% of the work force, Israel produced 95% of its own food requirements, supplementing this with imports of grain, oilseeds, meat, coffee, cocoa and sugar. Israel is home to two unique types of agricultural communities, the kibbutz and moshav, which developed as Jews from all over the world made aliyah to the country and embarked on rural settlement. History Citrus packing in Hadera before the establishment of the state. The development of modern agriculture was closely tied to the Zionist movement and Jewish immigration to Palestine in the late nineteenth century. Jews who immigrated purchased land that was mostly semi- arid, although much had been rendered untillable by deforestation, soil erosion and neglect. They set about clearing rocky fields, constructing terraces, draining swampland, reforesting, counteracting soil erosion, and washing salty land. Since independence in 1948, the total area under cultivation has increased from to , while the number of agricultural communities has increased from 400 to 725. Agricultural production has expanded 16 times, three times more than population growth. Water shortage is a major problem. Rain falls between September and April, with an uneven distribution across the country, from 28 inches (70 cm) in the north to less than 1 inch (2 cm) in the south. Annual renewable water resources are about , 75% of which is used for agriculture. Most of Israel's freshwater sources have been consequently joined to the National Water Carrier, network of pumping stations, reservoirs, canals and pipelines that transfers water from the north to the south. Today Ein Yahav hothouses The importance of agriculture in Israel's economy has fallen over time, accounting for decreasing values of GDP. In 1979, it accounted for just under 6% of GDP, 5.1% by 1985, and today, 2.5%.Agriculture in Israel In 1995, there were 43,000 farm units with an average size of 13.5 hectares. 19.8% of these were smaller than 1 hectare, 75.7% were 1 to 9 hectares in size, 3.3% were between 10 and 49 hectares, 0.4% were between 50 and 190 hectares, and 0.8% were larger than 200 hectares. Of the 380,000 hectares under cultivation in 1995, 20.8% was under permanent cultivation and 79.2% under rotating cultivation. Farm units included 160,000 hectares used for activities other than cultivation. Cultivation was based mainly in the northern coastal plains, the hills of the interior, and the upper Jordan Valley. In 2006, agricultural output fell by 0.6% following a 3.6% rise in 2005; inputs for 2007 rose by 1.2% excluding wages.Microsoft Word - covers.doc Between 2004 and 2006, vegetables accounted for around 35% of total agricultural output. Flowers made up around 20%, field crops made up around 18%, fruits (other than citrus), around 15%, and citrus fruits around 10%. In 2006, 36.7% of agricultural output was for domestic consumption, 33.9% for domestic manufacturing, and 22% for direct export. In 2006, 33% of vegetables, 27% of flowers, 16% of field crops, 15.5% of fruits other than citrus, and 9% of citrus fruits were exported. The area of irrigated farmland has increased from in 1948 to some today. Israeli agricultural production rose 26% between 1999 and 2009, while the number of farmers dropped from 23,500 to 17,000. Farmers have also grown more with less water, using 12% less water to grow 26% more produce.Fewer farmers, more produce, Haaretz Farm types Fields in the Jezreel Valley Most of Israel's agriculture is based on cooperative principles that evolved in the early twentieth century. Two unique forms of agricultural settlements; the kibbutz, a collective community in which the means of production are communally owned and each member's work benefits all; and the moshav, a farming village where each family maintains its own household and works its own land, while purchasing and marketing are conducted co-operatively. Both communities provided a means not only to realise the dream of the pioneers to have rural communities based on social equality, co-operation and mutual aid but also to gain agricultural output in a productive means. Today, between kibbutzim and moshavim, 76% of the country's fresh produce is output, as well as many processed food products. Agricultural produce Wheat growing in the Hula Valley =Crops= Due to the diversity of the land and climate across the country, Israel is able to grow a wide range of crops. Field crops grown in the country include wheat, sorghum and corn. On 215,000 hectares of land, these sorts of crops are grown, 156,000 hectares of which are winter crops. Fruit and vegetables grown include citrus, avocados, kiwifruit, guavas and mangoes, grapes from orchards located on the Mediterranean coastal plain. Tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and zucchini are grown commonly throughout the country; melons are grown during winter months in the valleys. Subtropical areas in the country produce bananas and dates, while in the northern hills apples, pears and cherries are grown. Furthermore, grape vineyards are found across the country, as the country's wine industry has developed to become a world-player. In 1997, $107 million worth of cotton was grown in Israel with most of this sold in advance on the futures market. The crop is grown on 28,570 hectares of land, all of which is drip irrigated. 5.5 tons per hectare of raw cotton is averaged for the Acala crop; the Pima crop averages 5 tons per hectare, which are yields among the highest in the world. =Livestock= Flock of sheep near Aviezer, Israel Local cows produce the highest amounts of milk per animal in the world, with an average of 10,208 kilograms (around 10,000 liters) of dairy in 2009, according to data published in 2011 by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, outperforming cows in the US ( per cow), Japan (7,497), the European Union (6,139) and Australia (5,601). A total of 1,304 million liters of milk was produced by Israeli cows in 2010. All of Israel's milk consumption originates from dairy farms within the country with most herds consisting largely of Israel-Holsteins, a high-yielding, disease-resistant breed. Furthermore, sheep milk is exported. In terms of poultry, which makes up two thirds of meat consumption, 85% originate from moshavim. =Fishing and aquaculture= Fishing in Israel The Mediterranean Sea is a source of salt- water fishing; freshwater fishing occurs on Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee). Pioneering technology is being used to breed fish in artificial lakes in the Negev desert. Scientists of the Bengis Center for Desert Aquaculture at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev discovered that the brackish water under the desert can be used for agriculture, aquaculture and a combination of the two. This has led to the farming of fish, shrimp and crustaceans in the Negev.BGU making a difference: Desert fishing Commercial fishing in the eastern Mediterranean has declined significantly due to depletion of fish reserves and the supply of fresh fish in Israel depends almost entirely on aquaculture. Fish from the Sea of Galilee include silver carp, grass carp, grey mullet, St. Peter's fish, rock bass, silver perch, and Asian seabass introduced from Australia. Fish grown in cages submerged in the sea include gilthead seabream (called denis in Israel), European sea bass and a South American variety of meager. Trout and salmon are raised in special canal-like ponds of running water of the Dan River, a tributary of the Jordan River.Gur, Jana, The Book of New Israeli Food, pg. 138 =Fruit and vegetables= Israel is one of the world's leading fresh citrus producers and exporters,Citrus fruit: biology, technology and evaluation, Milind S. Ladaniya including oranges, grapefruit, tangerines and a hybrid of a grapefruit and a pomelo, developed in Israel. More than forty types of fruit are grown in Israel. In addition to citrus, these include avocados, bananas, apples, cherries, plums, nectarines, grapes, dates, strawberries, prickly pear (tzabbar), persimmon, loquat and pomegranates.Gur, pp. 176-179 Israel is the second leading producer of loquat after Japan.Loquat fruit facts In 1973, two Israeli scientists, Haim Rabinowitch and Nachum Kedar, developed a variety of tomato with slower ripening than ordinary tomatoes in a hot climate.Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 'Science Train' traverses Israel to mark National Science Day Their research led to the development of the world's first long shelf-life commercial tomato varieties.Yissum: Seed improvement technology This discovery transformed agricultural economics in Israel, promoting the export of the vegetables seeds and the move to high-tech farming. It also had a global impact, enabling large-scale production through the prevention of spoilage. Previously, farmers were forced to discard 40 percent of their produce. The Tomaccio tomato was developed by Hishtil Nurseries, which conducted a 12-year breeding program using wild Peruvian tomato species to create a sweet snack tomato.Tomato 'Tomaccio' =Flowers= Flowers grown for export Israel produces vast quantities of flowers for export. Flower exports in 2000 exceeded $50 million. The flowers grown most commonly are Chamelaucium (waxflower), followed by roses, which are grown on 214 hectares of land. In addition to flowers favored in the West such as lilies, roses, and tulips, Israel exports desert varieties. It has become a major player in the global floral industry, especially as a supplier of traditional European flowers during the winter months. Agricultural technology Ketura in the Negev Desert Israel is a world leader in agricultural research and development, which has led to dramatic increases in the quantity and quality of the country's crops. The drive to increase yields and crop quality has led to the development of new seed and plant varieties, as well as to innovations such as a soil conditioner substance (vermiculite) which, when mixed with local soils, boosts crop yields, and drip irrigation. The Agritech Exhibition The Agritech Exhibition, held once every three years, is one of the leading international events of its kind to showcase Israel and international agriculture technologies. It traditionally attracts many Ministers of Agriculture, decision-makers, experts, practitioners and trainers in agriculture, and thousands of visitors. It provides an opportunity to see at one site the latest developments in agricultural sector and advanced agro- technologies, especially in the fields of irrigation, water management, arid zone agriculture, intensive greenhouse cultivation, development of new seed varieties, and organic and ecologically-oriented agriculture. At the Agritech Exhibition in 2012 there were more than 35,000 visitors, and more than 250 exhibitors. Organic farming Organic produce makes up 1.5% of Israeli agricultural output, but it accounts for 13% of agricultural exports. Israel has of organic fields: Vegetable crops grown in open fields account for 65% of the land use, fruit orchards - 25%, hothouse vegetables - 6% and herbs - 4%. Government regulation Farm surpluses have been almost eradicated in the country, with farms having production and water quotas for each crop, which have stabilised prices. Production quotas apply to milk, eggs, poultry and potatoes. Israel's government also encourages a reduction in agricultural costs by trying to encourage specialised farming, and halting of production of crops for which no sufficiently profitable markets exist. The Ministry of Agriculture oversees the country's agricultural sector, including maintenance of standards of plant and animal health, agricultural planning, and research and marketing.

The manor house was first built in the late 15th century by Sir John Gage, who made Firle Place his principal home. He held many high offices, including Constable of the Tower and was an executor of Henry VIII's will. The external cladding of the building is Georgian, using Caen Stone to make it look like a classical French Chateau. This work was completed by Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet who inherited the house in 1713 and the house is set in typically open parkland. The interior of the house however is Tudor in style and circulates around a central courtyard. The house has an extensive collection of paintings, porcelain and furniture, including works by Gainsborough, Reynolds, Van Dyck, Raphael, Puligo, Zoffany and Teniers. During World War I, students from the nearby Southover Manor School in Lewes were housed here, and during World War II, Canadian soldiers were quartered here. Open to the public during the summer months, the house and grounds area also used as a film and television location, it has featured in shows, including the BBC's Jonathan Creek and the three-part miniseries The Line of Beauty.

(The Bolneys held the lordship of Firle briefly after acquiring it from the bankrupt lord of the manor Thomas Levett.) This holding was further expanded by their son Sir John Gage who inherited land belonging to his father-in-law, Sir Thomas St Clere. In 1479 a second John Gage was born and it was he who became the ward to the Duke of Buckingham when his father died in 1497. Sir John became quite prominent at the court of King Henry VIII and even accompanied the king on an expedition to France. Following such campaigns and his competence in battle he was appointed Vice-Chamberlain to the King. Sir John also served as a key figure in the dissolution of the monasteries in Sussex, despite the fact that he remained a Catholic. Sir John's son, Edward, later became a Knight of the Bath and the Sheriff of Sussex and in 1556 oversaw the execution of the 17 \\"Sussex Martyrs\\" during the Marian Persecutions of 1555-57\\\\. The Gage Baronet was created by John Gage (d. 1633) in 1622. The 7th Baronet, Sir William Gage (1695-1744), was notable for his interest in cricket, particularly in Sussex. It is often thought that beginnings of what is now Firle Cricket Club started with Sir William. In 1754 this Baronet title was raised by Irish-born Thomas Gage to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Gage and Viscount Gage. Another notable Gage is General Thomas Gage who was made Commander in Chief of the British forces in North America. However, following the outbreak of the American War of Independence, he was relatively successful but after disastrous losses at Battle of Bunker Hill he was replaced. His son, also called Thomas Gage (1781-1820), following what was now a family tradition was a botanist and traveller and had the flower genus Gagea named after him. The current Viscount Gage, Henry Nicholas Gage, lives at Firle.

It is situated at the confluence of two mountain streams, the Gave d'Ossau and its tributary, the Valentin. Formerly part of the province of B√©arn, Laruns is now within the d√©partement of Pyr√©n√©es- Atlantiques, itself in France's Nouvelle-Aquitaine r√©gion. It forms part of the arrondissement of Oloron-Sainte-Marie, and of the canton of Oloron-Sainte- Marie-2. Geography Laruns is geographically the third-largest commune in metropolitan France, after Arles and Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. It includes a large area of upland, around and between the Gave d'Ossau and its tributaries, stretching as far as the border with Spain at the Col du Pourtalet, to the south of the village of Laruns. The principal artery of communications through the commune is the D934 road, which runs south from the town of Pau, to the north, to the Col du Pourtalet. The D918 road branches off the D934 in Laruns village, and follows the Valentin before crossing the Col d'Aubisque to Argel√®s-Gazost in the next major valley to the east. There are no direct roads westward from Laruns. Because of its large geographic size, the Laruns contains several recognisably distinct communities in addition to Laruns itself. These include:The villages of the city of Laruns * Pon, an area of Laruns * Espalungue, an area of Laruns * G√™tre, an area of Laruns * Gabas, a hamlet below the Pic du Midi d'Ossau, and where the valley road is crossed by the GR10 long distance footpath that runs the length of the Pyrenees * Geteu, a former commune merged into Laruns in 1828 * Goust, a small plateau with an ambiguous international status; formerly recognized as independent by France and Spain, now considered a de facto part of France, if not de jure. * Eaux- Chaudes, a spa situated at the southern entrance to the Gorge du Hourat * Artouste-Fabr√®ges, a ski resort situated in the valley of the Gave du Brousset, and the beginning of the summer scenic route to the Lac d'Artouste via the Petit train d'Artouste * Miegebat Neighboring communes and municipalities: * North: G√®re-B√©lesten and Aste-B√©on * East: Arrens-Marsous (Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es), Louvie-Soubiron, B√©ost and Eaux-Bonnes * West: Aydius, Bedous, Cette-Eygun, Etsaut and Urdos * South: Sallent de G√°llego (Huesca, Spain).

The proposals were put together by H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Jack Caulfield in 1971. Caulfield, a former police officer, created a plan to target the Democratic Party and the anti-Vietnam War movement, inspired by what he believed to be the Democratic Party's employment of a private investigation firm. The operation was planned to help Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign. Operation Sandwedge included proposed surveillance of Nixon's enemies to gather information on their financial status and sexual activities, to be carried out through illegal black bag operations. Control of Sandwedge was passed to G. Gordon Liddy, who abandoned it in favor of a strategy of his own devising, Operation Gemstone, which detailed a plan to break into Democratic Party offices in the Watergate complex. Liddy's plan eventually led to the downfall of Nixon's presidency, which Caulfield believed would have been avoided had Sandwedge been acted upon. Background In 1968, Richard Nixon, the United States Republican Party nominee, won the presidential election, defeating Democrat Hubert Humphrey by seven-tenths of a percent of the popular vote. Nixon appointed H. R. Haldeman as his Chief of Staff; this position granted Haldeman a relatively large degree of control over the activities of the presidential administration. Haldeman had first worked for Nixon in 1956, during Nixon's successful bid for the vice- presidency under Dwight D. Eisenhower. By 1971, Nixon's staff were receiving a cursory intelligence report from Haldeman's assistant, Gordon C. Strachan; Strachan's reports essentially collated information about political rallies and campaign groups that had already been gathered by the police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Prior to this, Nixon's initial election bid had already involved the planting of rumors and false information about his opponents as a dedicated strategy; these tactics had been dubbed \\"political hardball\\" by Nixon's opposition researcher Pat Buchanan. In August 1971, Strachan had convinced Jeb Stuart Magruder, a member of the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP)‚Äîthe campaign group for Nixon's re-election bid‚Äîto infiltrate the office of Edmund Muskie. Muskie was a Democratic senator who had been Humphrey's 1968 vice-presidential candidate, and was a front- runner for his party's presidential bid for the 1972 campaign. Inception In late 1971, John Dean, the White House Counsel, pushed to expand the existing intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the task to Jack Caulfield, a member of his staff who was a former New York police officer. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon that the idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions. John Ehrlichman, a long-time friend of Haldeman, who had also served as White House Counsel, had been part of the operation's inception; at this time he was Nixon's domestic affairs assistant. Ehrlichman was the one who had initially hired Caulfield in 1969; Ehrlichman intended for Caulfield to conduct private investigation while undercover as a private sector employee, it was Caulfield who insisted on working from the White House. Caulfield's work to this end had already resulted in two wiretaps on phone lines‚Äîone on Nixon's brother Donald, and another on journalist Joseph Kraft. Caulfield prepared a twelve-page draft proposal detailing an intelligence- gathering strategy, aimed at the opposition Democratic Party; he had worked on this draft for several months and presented it to Nixon's staff in September 1971. The proposal, dubbed \\"Operation Sandwedge\\", called for a budget of $500,000, primarily to cover private investigative work and security for the Republican National Convention, however Caulfield intimated privately that it would also include electronic surveillance. Planned activities The investigations and surveillance would, in part, assess how the anti-Vietnam War movement could damage Nixon's campaign. Nixon's staff also anticipated that the Democratic campaign would employ the services of Intertel, a private investigation firm led by former Department of Justice officials who had served under Robert F. Kennedy, a Democrat and former Attorney General. Caulfield noted that this firm had the potential to employ \\"formidable and sophisticated\\" intelligence-gathering techniques, and Sandwedge was his attempt to create a Republican counterpart to it. The plan would involve black bag operations, targeting political enemies of the campaign. Electronic surveillance was also an element of the proposal, with plans to scrutinize the private lives of the targets, including their tax records and sexual habits. The Sandwedge proposal also included a list of people willing to work with Caulfield on the project; these included several investigators and officials of Inland Revenue, and a former sheriff of Cook County, Illinois. Herb Kalmbach, Nixon's own attorney, transferred $50,000 to Caulfield at the request of John N. Mitchell. Mitchell had served as Attorney General under Nixon's first term, and directed the 1972 re-election campaign. Caulfield was also given responsibility for the salary of Tony Ulasewicz, an operative he planned to use for Sandwedge activities. However, Strachan, Dean and other staff members were frustrated at the pace of Caulfield's development of the project. Strachan directly questioned whether Caulfield was adequately capable for the role in a memo dated from October 1971, while Haldeman, wishing for a project on a larger scale, pressed Mitchell for a budget of $800,000 for surveillance and \\"miscellaneous\\" activities. During this time, Caulfield recruited James W. McCord, Jr., a retired CIA officer, to protect the offices of the Republican National Convention and the CRP from electronic bugging. McCord would later be directly employed by CRP from January 1972. Caulfield also sent Ulasewicz to the campaign offices of Paul McCloskey in New Hampshire. McCloskey was a Republican congressman for California, who was running for the party's presidential nomination against Nixon on a platform opposing the Vietnam War. He was not regarded as a credible threat to Nixon's campaign, but had made statements calling for Nixon to be impeached. In December 1971, Ulasewicz masqueraded as a journalist to interview McCloskey's staff, with Caulfield dubbing the effort a \\"Sandwedge-engineered penetration\\". Cancellation That October, a meeting concerning Sandwedge was arranged between Haldeman, Mitchell, Magruder and Strachan. As a result of this meeting, control of the operation was passed along to G. Gordon Liddy, because Mitchell wished to have a lawyer in charge of the campaign's intelligence- gathering. Another factor in Caulfield's removal from the helm was the belief of several White House officials, including Dean, that Caulfield's Irish- American, non-college educated background was at odds with \\"an Administration of WASP professional men\\". Liddy built upon the proposals to devise \\"Operation Gemstone\\", a more expansive plan of espionage. Gemstone was an umbrella term for several individual operations, each of which expanded upon elements of the Sandwedge draft or existing CRP activities‚ÄîOperation Diamond covered breaking up protest demonstrations, Ruby involved undercover infiltration and honeypot traps, Crystal concerned electronic surveillance and wiretaps, and Sapphire proposed the sabotage of rival political campaigns. Liddy's initial draft of Operation Gemstone was deemed \\"too extreme\\" by campaign officials, but a scaled-down version was later approved in 1972. Despite Liddy's restructuring of the project, a request for additional funding for the original Sandwedge proposal was made by Dean in January 1972, although Mitchell's rejection of this request signalled the project's end. Liddy's revised Gemstone plan included a range of illegal activities, including a proposal to break into Democratic Party offices in the Watergate complex. The Watergate burglaries were initially assumed to have been part of Operation Sandwedge, and the investigation into both the burglaries and the project led to Caulfield's resignation from his Nixon-appointed position as assistant director of criminal enforcement in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Aftermath In the wake of the Watergate scandal, 69 people were tried for various crimes, with 48 of these pleading guilty. Among those found guilty for covering up the affair were Haldeman, Ehrlichmann, Mitchell, Dean and Magruder, while Liddy was found guilty for his role in the break-ins. All 48 men served time in prison as a result of their convictions. Caulfield has suggested that Sandwedge's cancellation by the administration was an error in judgement, possibly \\"the most monumental of the Nixon Presidency\\". He believed that, had Sandwedge been adopted as the campaign's strategy, \\"there would have been no Liddy, no Hunt, no McCord\\", and the subsequent Watergate scandal would not have occurred. Speaking of the initial proposal, Dean defended its merits, stating that \\"Caulfield, not the plan itself, had killed Sandwedge\\".

Compared to other genera within the Cocoseae Allagoptera is described as particularly specialized.Uhl, Natalie W. and Dransfield, John (1987) Genera Palmarum - A classification of palms based on the work of Harold E. Moore. Lawrence, Kansas: Allen Press. / The genus name is a Greek combination of \\"change\\" and \\"feather\\", describing the full leaf; it was formerly named Diplothemium. Description Allagoptera produces very short or acaulescent trunks and in cases where the trunk grows erect it often makes a downward turn leaving the crown below the trunk-base. The trunks in Allagoptera are among the few in the palm family which tend to bifurcate, producing multiple heads per unit. The pinnate leaves are gently arching to 2 m and are carried on long, slender petioles which are adaxially channeled. The single-fold leaflets are regularly or irregularly arranged on the rachis each protruding into a different plane, creating a plumose leaf. The unusual spicate inflorescence emerges from within the leaf-crown carrying the pistilate flowers basally with the staminate flowers growing distally. The single-seeded fruit is yellow to brown, growing in crowded clusters.Riffle, Robert L. and Craft, Paul (2003) An Encyclopedia of Cultivated Palms.

His nickname 'Crinks' is alleged to have derived from the wrinkled face he had as a baby.Coote, The Other Club One of his ancestors was Sir William Vernon Harcourt (1827‚Äì1904) who was Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under William Ewart Gladstone. His paternal grandfather was the first Baron Derwent. Harcourt Johnstone was educated at Eton College and at Balliol College, Oxford. In the First World War he served in the Rifle Brigade and on the staff in France and Belgium. Politics Drawn to politics, he unsuccessfully contested Willesden East for the Liberals at the general election of 1922. However the sitting Tory MP, Sir H M Mallaby-Deeley, resigned in 1923 causing a by-election which was held on 3 March 1923. Johnstone was again chosen to contest the seat for the Liberals and won by a majority of 5,176 votes over the Conservative George Frederick Stanley. Johnstone held the seat in the 1923 general election, only to lose it to Stanley at the 1924 general election.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p277 He then tried and failed to return to the House of Commons at by- elections: first at Eastbourne in 1925Craig, page 480 and later at Westbury in 1927,Craig, page 499 where he lost by just 149 votes.

In May 1940, even though Johnstone was outside Parliament, Winston Churchill decided to appoint him to the government as Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade.The Times, 16 May 1940 Two months later the Liberal constituency of Middlesbrough West became vacant when the sitting MP, Frank Kingsley Griffith, was made a county court judgeThe Times, 18 July 1940 and Johnstone was returned for the seat at a by-election on 7 August 1940 unopposed under the terms of the wartime electoral truce.The Times, 8 August 1940 He was made a Privy Councillor in 1943. By common consent he was an effective minister. He is to date the last MP for South Shields to have represented any party other than Labour. Minister Although little known today, Johnstone was the most prominent Liberal member of the wartime coalition government after Sir Archie Sinclair, who was Liberal leader from 1935 to 1945. He was a key figure in the Liberal Party Organisation between the two World Wars and was Secretary of the influential Liberal Candidates Association. He was a leading supporter of H. H. Asquith in the party split with David Lloyd George and used a lot of his own personal wealth to support the ailing Liberal party. During the National Government after 1931 he remained a faithful member of the Samuelite Liberals, always supporting the traditional policy of Free Trade against protectionism. After 1935, again out of Parliament, he gave close support to Sinclair and, despite the animosities of earlier years, endorsed Sinclair's attempts to reunite the Liberal party with the Lloyd George family group of MPs. Despite temptations to defect from the party during these years ‚Äì and plenty did ‚Äì he remained a constant Liberal. Johnstone's unexpected return to government and Parliament in 1940 came about mainly as a result of his closeness to Sinclair and his friendship with Churchill. Johnstone had been a member and one-time co-secretary with Brendan Bracken of the Other Club since the early 1930s. The Other Club was a political dining club founded by Churchill and F. E. Smith in 1911. This fitted with Johnstone's reputation for enjoying the good life. In his diaries, \\"Chips\\", Sir Henry Channon said that Harcourt \\"dug his own grave with his teeth\\". He was known as a lover of books, furniture and pictures, being good fun and good company and not being a great exponent of taking exercise.Jo Grimond, Memoirs 1979(p.69) Death Aged only 49, Johnstone died suddenly in March 1945 at Westminster Hospital of a cerebral stroke.The Times, 1 March 1945 A memorial service was held for him at the Church of St. Margaret, Westminster on 13 March attended by the prime minister and Clementine Churchill, Clement Attlee (deputy prime minister) and Anthony Eden amongst prominent government mourners.The Times, 14 March 1945 here References Further reading *C.R.Coote.

The book, which revealed previously unknown details on the making of Bush administration's foreign policy, was described as \\"brilliantly reported\\" by The New York Times Book Review and generated news articles and reviews in two dozen countries around the world. Kessler's reporting played a role in two foreign policy controversies during the presidency of George W. Bush. He was called to testify in the trial of I. Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby, in which he was questioned about a 2003 telephone conversation with Libby in which the name of Valerie Plame, a CIA operative, might have been discussed. (Libby recalled they had discussed Plame; Kessler said they did not.) Meanwhile, a 2004 telephone conversation between Kessler and Steve J. Rosen, a senior official at American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), was at the core of the AIPAC leaking case. The federal government recorded the call and made it the centerpiece of its 2005 indictment of Rosen and an alleged co-conspirator; the charges were dropped in 2009. The Wall Street Journal called Kessler \\"one of the most aggressive journalists on the State Department beat.\\" The Atlantic, in a 2007 profile of Condoleezza Rice, said that \\"week after week, Kessler asks the best questions, and the most questions, at the secretary‚Äôs press conferences.\\" Kessler, a specialist on nuclear proliferation (especially in Iran and North Korea) and the Middle East, wrote the first article on the North Korea nuclear facility being built in Syria that was destroyed by Israeli jets. He was immediately attacked for spreading neoconservative propaganda but his reporting turned out to be correct and apologies were later offered. In a lengthy article, Kessler also revealed the Bush administration's internal decision-making that led to the Iraq war.The Washington Post January 12, 2003 ‚Äì U.S. Decision On Iraq Has Puzzling Past He traveled with three different Secretaries of State ‚Äì Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton ‚Äì and for several years wrote a blog about his experiences on those trips. An article he wrote on apparent tensions between Rice and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld during a 2006 trip to Iraq was later denounced by Rumsfeld as \\"just fairly typical Washington Post stuff.\\" Kessler joined The Washington Post in 1998 as the national business editor and later served as economic policy reporter. Kessler also was a reporter with Newsday for eleven years, covering the White House, politics, the United States Congress, airline safety and Wall Street. His investigative articles on airline safety led to the indictments of airline executives and federal officials for fraud, prompted congressional hearings into safety issues and spurred the federal government to impose new safety rules for DC-9 jets and begin regular inspections of foreign airlines. He won the Premier Award from the Aviation Space Writers Association and the investigative reporting award from the Society of the Silurians. At Newsday, Kessler shared in two Pulitzer Prizes given for spot news reporting.1997 Pulitzer Prize in spot news reporting (TWA Flight 800); 1992 Pulitzer Prize in spot news reporting (Manhattan subway derailment) Washington Post Fact Checker In the Washington Post \\"Fact Checker,\\" Kessler rates statements by politicians, usually on a range of one to four Pinocchios ‚Äì with one Pinocchio for minor shading of the facts and four Pinocchios for outright lies. If the statement is truthful, the person will get a rare \\"Geppetto.\\" Kessler has a new blog post at least five times a week; one column appears every week in the Sunday print edition of The Washington Post. Kessler's team includes another reporter and a video producer, who also write fact checks edited by Kessler. Kessler is considered one of the pioneers in political fact checking, a movement that inspired nearly 300 fact-checking organizations in 83 countries, according to a tally by the Duke Reporters‚Äô Lab. In 1996, while at Newsday, \\"Kessler wrote what may have been the first lengthy fact-check story in a major American newspaper, a preemptive guide to a debate between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole aimed at helping viewers evaluate the claims they were about to hear.\\" He documented the growth of fact checking around the world in an article for Foreign Affairs magazine, written after training journalists in Morocco. In a 2012 study of fact checkers, the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University concluded that Kessler \\"splits almost evenly between the two parties.\\" A columnist for The Wall Street Journal attacked the whole idea of awarding Pinocchios as akin to movie-reviewing, saying \\"the ‚Äòfact check‚Äô is opinion journalism or criticism, masquerading as straight news.\\" The conservative Power Line political blog devoted three articles to critiquing one of Kessler‚Äôs articles, calling him a \\"liberal reporter\\", and asserting that \\"these 'fact-checkers' nearly always turn out to be liberal apologists who don a false mantle of objectivity in order to advance the cause of the Democratic Party.\\" Kessler's awarding of Four Pinocchios to GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain for comments he made on Margaret Sanger and the founding of Planned Parenthood was also criticized by opponents of abortion. Yet Power Line also said that Kessler's extensive review of Democratic charges that Romney was a \\"flip-flopper\\" turned out to be \\"admirably fair-minded.\\" The liberal blog Talking Points Memo took Kessler to task for giving Four Pinocchios to a Democratic web petition on Medicare, saying the errors he allegedly made \\"were not just small misses, but big belly flop misses.\\" The Obama White House issued a statement titled \\"Fact Checking the Fact Checker\\" after Kessler gave Obama Three Pinocchios for statements he made on the auto industry bailout. The Democratic National Committee released a statement denouncing \\"Kessler‚Äôs hyperbolic, over the top fact check of the DNC‚Äôs assertion that Mitt Romney supports private Social Security accounts.\\" In 2013, Kessler launched an iOS app, titled GlennKessler for iOS, for his column on the App Store. The app was created by his son, Hugo Kessler. It contained his newest articles and general biographical information. The app was updated with a new design for iOS 7 in the fall of 2013. In 2014, he released a redesigned version of the app for the iPad and added a Pinocchio Game based on his column and a multitude of video interviews. In 2015, Kessler exposed a series of false and misleading statistics about sex trafficking, which led politicians and advocacy groups to stop making those claims. Kessler appeared in a segment of The Daily Show about fact-checking Trump. \\"In terms of fact checking, Hillary Clinton is like playing chess with a real pro,\\" he told Jordan Klepper. \\"Fact-checking Donald Trump is like playing checkers, with somebody who‚Äôs not very good at it. It‚Äôs pretty boring. His facts are so easily disproved there‚Äôs no joy in hunt.\\" Kessler was instrumental in convincing Google to begin elevating fact checks in its search results, after pitching a Google executive on the idea \\"over a couple of Spanish espressos\\" during a conference in Valencia, Spain. The discussion led to the creation of Claim Review, as defined by schema.org, and the increased visibility of fact checks in Google News and Google search results. Shortly after Trump became President, Kessler announced a 100-day project to list every false and misleading statement made by Trump while in office. Kessler's team counted 492 untruths in the first 100 days, or an average of 4.9 per day. In response to reader requests, Kessler decided to keep it going for Trump's first year and then his entire presidency. As of January 20, 2020, Trump's three-year anniversary, Kessler and his colleagues had counted 16,241 untruths, or an average of 15 a day. Trump \\"averaged six such claims a day in 2017, nearly 16 a day in 2018 and more than 22 a day in 2019,\\" Kessler wrote, noting that \\"in a single year, the president said more than the total number of false or misleading claims he had made in the previous two years.\\" The database has drawn nationwide attention and been the subject of research by academicians. \\"Kessler is doing the poet‚Äôs work. Honor him,\\" wrote New York Times columnist Roger Cohen. \\"The database he compiles with his colleagues Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly, listing every one of Trump‚Äôs untruths, will become a reference, a talisman.\\" In August 2018, Kessler came under fire for his coverage of a Mercatus Center study on the perceived costs of Senator Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All plan. Kessler released corrections to his fact check, which stated the Sanders's claims of $2.1 trillion in 10-year National Health Expenditure savings were cherry-picked. Kessler did not change his Three- Pinocchio rating and his findings were affirmed by other fact-checking organizations, including PolitiFact, FactCheck.org and the Associated Press. After addressing the Kentucky legislature in 2019 on behalf of its ethics commission, Kessler was named a Kentucky Colonel, the state's highest honor, for his contributions to the nation. Kessler noted on Twitter that he had awarded Four Pinocchios to the two people who had signed the declaration: Gov. Matt Bevin and Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. The Washington Post on April 22, 2020 announced that Kessler and his team had written a book, \\"Donald Trump and His Assault on Truth: The President's Falsehoods, Misleading Claims and Flat-Out Lies,\\" to be published June 2 by Scribner. \\"More than a catalogue of false claims, Donald Trump and His Assault on Truth is a necessary guide to understanding the motives behind the president‚Äôs falsehoods,\\" the announcement said. Kirkus Reviews, in a starred review, called the book \\"an extremely valuable chronicle.\\" The book appeared on Publisher Weekly's top ten best-seller list. Awards and honors * S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University's Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, Honorable Mention (2019) ‚Äì Kessler and the Washington Post Fact Checker team were honored for the Fact Checker's database of Trump's misleading claims; the judges praised fact checks that are \\"clear, deliberate and never hyperbolic.\\" * National Association for Media Literacy Education's Media Literate Media award (2015) ‚Äì received the award, which honors achieves in media literacy education or media literacy, for his work on \\"The Fact Checker.\\" Personal life Kessler lives in McLean, Virginia, with his wife, Cynthia Rich. They have three children: Andre, Hugo, and Mara Kessler. Kessler is a great-grandson of Jean Baptiste August Kessler, who was largely responsible for the growth and development of the Royal Dutch Shell (Shell Oil Company) and a grandson of Geldolph Adriaan Kessler, who helped create the Dutch steel industry. He was born in Cincinnati, where his father, Adriaan Kessler, was an executive at Procter & Gamble, and he attended high school there and in Lexington, Kentucky. Kessler's mother, Else Bolotin, was a psychologist who in Lexington \\"helped women in that era of feminist awakening confront a society dominated by men.\\" Both of his parents were Dutch, and immigrated to the United States after marriage. In an interview with Brian Lamb broadcast on C-SPAN, Kessler said he had decided he wanted to be journalist when he was only in fifth grade, after he created a neighborhood newspaper. \\"Even though it was a newsletter for only a few blocks in the neighborhood, I grandly called it the 'Cincinnati Fact,'\\" he said. Kessler is a 1981 graduate of Brown University and received a Masters of International Affairs in 1983 from the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.

The country is deeply religious and one of the most conservative countries in the world, where sex outside marriage is against the law. Despite the restrictions prostitution activities are reported to be thriving in the capital Kabul as well as in the Mazar-e-Sharif area in the north of the country. Mazar-e-Sharif has become unofficial capital of prostitution in Afghanistan. So much so that 'going to Mazar' has become a byword for Afghan men looking to pay for sex. Females for sale markets have also sprung up in eastern Afghanistan in recent years, where lawlessness has led to many petty crimes. A large number of women from mainly China, Iran, Pakistan, Philippines, Tajikistan, and Uganda and other countries are imported for prostitution into Afghanistan. According to the Afghan Interior Ministry's department of sexual crimes, about 2 to 3 prostitution arrests were made each week in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2008. Under the former Taliban regime, prostitution existed clandestinely in Kabul, despite being outlawed due to the government following a very strict interpretation of the Islamic Sharia law. Melissa Ditmore reports in Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work that during their rule the traffic in women for prostitution thrived. Prostitutes mostly worked from their houses termed as Qalas and in Kabul there were 25 to 30 hidden brothels. Legality and consequences The practice of prostitution in Afghanistan is illegal, with punishments ranging from 5 to 15 years imprisonment and 80 lashes if unmarried. Married prostitutes are considered adulterers under the Afghan penal code and subject to execution. Prostitution was even more strictly prohibited under the rule of the Taliban, with those thought of having extramarital sex risking extrajudicial killing by cultural fundamentalists and Islamists. =Extrajudicial risks= * In July 2008, two Afghan women were accused of running a secret prostitution service and working for the police and killed by the Taliban in the Ghazni Province, although the local authorities as well as the American military in the area claimed the women were innocent. * Two Afghan women accused of prostitution were shot dead in July 2010.  Dynamics  Prostitution in the country is mostly driven by poverty and displacement. Prohibition for women to work under Taliban rule meant some street children were forced into the trade in order to make a living. According to the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, females from Iran, Tajikistan, China, and possibly Uganda and other places are forced into prostitution in Afghanistan. Women from Tajikistan are believed to be trafficked through Afghanistan to other countries for prostitution. Trafficked Iranian women transit Afghanistan en route to Pakistan. Afghan women as well as boys and girls among recently returned refugees from neighboring countries were reported to be forced into prostitution, a number of children were also reported being sold into it by their family. The number of prostitutes in Afghanistan is small. A 2007 University of Manitoba report suggests that there may be about 900 female prostitutes in Kabul, which is a city with a population of over 3 million. UNAIDS estimated there were 12,500 prostitutes in the country in 2016. About two to three prostitution arrests were made between 2007 and 2008 each week in Afghanistan, according to the Afghan Interior Ministry's department of sexual crimes. According to Afghan traditions, the shame of prostitution is so intense that sometimes those involved in such activities are assassinated by the many religious extremists found throughout the country or in some cases by family members. =Brothels= Brothels, sometimes run by foreigners, sometimes with links to larger criminal networks, manage to exist in several cities of the country by paying bribes to police officers who come to raid them. There are reports of a couple of brothels in northern Afghanistan, in and around the Mazar-i-Sharif area of Balkh Province. The capital Kabul saw an extraordinary number of Chinese brothels (\\"Chinese restaurants\\") opened in the four years following the fall of the Taliban regime. Four years later a series of police raids reduced the brothels to 3 which caters, according to Reuters, to a mainly high-income international clientele as Afghan aren't generally accepted in or, according to USA Today, to mostly Afghan men. =Temporary marriages= Nikah mut'ah is a fixed-term marriage practiced mainly in Shia Islam, but is rejected by the majority Sunni Muslims (see misyar marriage, nikah urfi, nikah halala). There are also some recent reports about Mut'ah (Fegha in Persian language) beginning to be practiced in Mazar-i-Sharif. Bacha bazi Like in many other Islamic countries, it is a major taboo in Afghan culture for women to dance in front of men. Males and females are segregated during weddings and other parties. As a form of adult entertainment, young males dress as females and dance in front of men to make money. \\"Bacha bereesh\\" (meaning \\"boys without beards\\" in Persian language) occasionally dance to entertain men at certain parties, especially in the north parts of Afghanistan. Powerful patrons sometimes sexually exploit the dancers.  The \\"Curse of 39\\"  The 'Curse of 39' refers to the belief in some parts of Afghanistan that the number 39 is cursed or a badge of shame as it is purportedly linked with prostitution. The cause of the number's undesirability is unclear, but it has widely been claimed to have been associated with a pimp, allegedly living in the western city of Herat, who was nicknamed \\"39\\" after the registration plate of his expensive car and the number of his apartment. The number is said to translate into morda-gow, literally meaning \\"dead cow\\" but a well-known slang term for a pimp. Others have blamed corrupt police officials for spreading the rumour in order to charge between $200‚Äì$500 to change a \\"39\\" plate. Vehicle registration plates incorporating the number are seen as so undesirable that vehicles and apartments bearing the numerals are said to be virtually unsellable in the capital, Kabul. The drivers of such vehicles have reported receiving abuse and derision from pedestrians and other drivers, and some have had their registration plates altered to disguise the numbers. One such driver, Zalmay Ahmadi, told The Guardian: \\"When I drive around all the other cars flash their lights, beep their horns and people point at me. All my classmates now call me Colonel 39.\\" Sex trafficking Human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Afghanistan, and traffickers exploit victims from Afghanistan abroad. Internal trafficking is more prevalent than transnational trafficking. Some Afghan families knowingly sell their children into sex trafficking, including for bacha bazi. There are reports that some law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and judges accept bribes from or use their relationships with perpetrators of bacha bazi to allow them to escape punishment. Afghan returnees from Pakistan and Iran and internally displaced Afghans are vulnerable to exploitation in sex trafficking. There are also women and girls markets in eastern Afghanistan, around the regions of Nangarhar and Paktia, where the females are sold openly. Some of the victims are said to be imported into Pakistan where the tradition started from. Men, women, and children in Afghanistan often pay intermediaries to assist them in finding employment, primarily in Iran, Pakistan, India, Europe, or North America; some of these intermediaries force Afghans into prostitution. Afghan women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking primarily in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and India. Some Afghan boys are subjected to sex trafficking in Greece after paying high fees to be smuggled into the country. Afghan traffickers subjected Afghan boys to bacha bazi in Germany, Hungary, Macedonia, and Serbia. Traffickers have subjected women and girls from China, Iran, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Tajikistan to sex trafficking in Afghanistan. In 2019, the United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons downgraded Afghanistan to a 'Tier 2 watchlist' country.

Arnold Ros√© is second from left. The Ros√© Quartet was a string quartet formed by Arnold Ros√© in 1882. It was active for 55 years, until 1938.  Members  Its members changed over time. Ros√© was first violin throughout. Julius Egghard Jr. played the second violin at first; then it was Albert Bachrich, until 1905 when Paul Fischer joined. Violist was initially Anton Loh, then Hugo von Steiner until 1901 when Anton Ruzitska came on; after 1920, Max Handl played the viola. Eduard Ros√©, Arnold‚Äôs brother, had been a founding member of the ensemble playing the cello, but left after one season to get married and was replaced by Reinhold Hummer, who was in turn replaced by Friedrich Buxbaum; cellist Anton Walter joined in 1921, but later on Buxbaum rejoined. The group's peak period was between 1905 and 1920, with Ros√©, Fischer, Ruzitska, and Buxbaum. Repertoire The quartet's repertoire was based around the works of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, but many contemporary composers also benefited from the quartet's support, including Arnold Schoenberg. Associations The group participated in the Vienna premieres of works by Brahms, including his Clarinet Quintet and his Quintet in G major Opus 111. It also premiered Schoenberg's first and second string quartets and participated in the premiere of Verkl√§rte Nacht along with two members of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra: Franz Jelinek, viola, and Franz Schmidt, violoncello. Among the quartet's performing collaborators were Julius R√∂ntgen, Johannes Brahms, Franz Steiner, Bruno Walter, and Richard M√ºhlfeld. The quartet also made recordings.

7 December 2010), better known by his stage name Kari Tapio, was a Finnish schlager and country & western singer. During his career, he was one of the most popular singers in Finland for decades; having sold over 830,000 certified records (during his career and posthumously), he is the best-selling soloist in the country. Tapio was born in Suonenjoki, Finland. In the 1960s Tapio performed in his home town Pieks√§m√§ki with the local bands ER-Quartet and Jami & The Noisemakers. In 1966 he took singing lessons from Ture Ara. After Tapio's first single \\"Tuuli k√§√§ntyk√∂√∂n\\"/\\"Niskavuoren nuorimmainen\\" in 1972, he performed in Ilkka \\"Danny\\" Lipsanen's show. In the beginning his role was to take care of the snake that was used in the show. Before music became a job for Tapio, he worked as a typesetter in a printing house. In 1976 Tapio finally broke through with his single Laula kanssain (literally \\"Sing with Me\\", a Finnish cover of Jackpot's Sing My Love Song), which was followed by Viisitoista kes√§√§ (\\"Fifteen Summers,\\" a cover of Living Next Door to Alice) and Kaipuu (\\"Longing\\", a cover of Mort Shuman's Sorrow). In later years Olen suomalainen (\\"I Am a Finn\\", a cover of Toto Cutugno's L'Italiano), Myrskyn j√§lkeen (\\"After the Storm\\"), En pyyd√§ paljon (\\"I Don't Ask for Much\\", a cover of Paulina Rubio's Te Quise Tanto) and Paalupaikka (\\"Pole Position\\"), among others, were among his most popular songs. In 2003 the Iskelm√§-Finlandia award was given to him. Many of Tapio's songs have influences from country music. He sang many Finnish versions of the songs of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson. Tapio was one of the candidates to represent Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 with the song Valaise y√∂. In the finals, he placed second; and Ter√§sbetoni was chosen to represent Finland. Tapio died of a heart attack in Espoo, Finland.

Hewitt Mary Elizabeth Hewitt (later, Mary Elizabeth Stebbins; pen names, Ione and Jane; 1818 ‚Äì October 9, 1894) was an American poet and editor who flourished in the 1840s and 1850s. She published: Memorial of F. S. Osgood; Songs of Our Lord; Heroines of History; and Poems Sacred, Passionate, and Legendary. Early life Mary Elizabeth Moore was born in 1818, in Malden, Massachusetts, a country town about five miles from Boston. Her mother, left early a widow, removed to Boston. Career Hewitt lived in Boston with her until she married James Lang Hewitt, around 1827. His father was the musician, James Hewitt; his brother was the composer, John Hill Hewitt, and his sister was the musician, Sophia Hewitt Ostinelli. In 1829, the couple removed to city of New York City. Hewitt's earlier poems appeared in The Knickerbocker, Southern Literary Messenger (\\"A Bivouac in the Desert\\", July 1844), and other periodicals, under the signature of \\"Ione\\" and \\"Jane\\". In 1845, she published a small volume of poems, selected from her contributions to the various periodicals, entitled, Songs of our Land, and other Poems. This volume confirmed the high opinions which had been formed of her abilities from the fugitive pieces that had been popularly attributed to her. Her compositions in this collection demonstrated that she has a fine and well-cultivated understanding, and they are distinguished in an unusual degree for lyrical power and harmony as well as for sweetness of versification. The verses were evidently the utterance of a warm and impassioned heart, and strong imagination. The thoughts were expressed gracefully and harmomoniously, and bore the stamp of truth and originality. Hewitt's poem \\"Harold the Valiant\\" appeared closely upon the date of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \\"The Skeleton in Armor\\" (1841), with which it had points of resemblance. In 1850, Hewitt edited a gift book, called The Gem of the Western World; and the Memorial, a tribute to the memory of her friend, Frances Sargent Osgood. In 1854, she married Russell Stebbins. Among the later productions of Hewitt were some elegant translations, which illustrated her taste and learning, and a fine command of language. Her last work was The Heroines of History (1856). Samuel Stillman Osgood's Portrait of Mrs. Mary E. Hewitt, (1818- .), oil on canvas, measuring 25 inches by 30 inches, was presented by Hewitt to the New- York Historical Society on April 15, 1861. Painted circa 1850, the artist was the husband of Hewitt's friend Frances Osgood. She died October 9, 1894. She is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

He was one of the leading citizens of Southwest Virginia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, both as a practicing lawyer and as a political figure. His prominence corresponded with the rise of the coal business in central Appalachia. His legacy includes both the continuation of the energy companies that he helped to create, and the outstanding careers of the legal figures who worked with and learned from him, just as he was the heir to a series of accomplished legal figures. As the leader of a citizen police force, he was the model for a character in one of the best-selling novels in the United States in the first half of the 20th century. Biography Born in Jefferson County, Kentucky, Bullitt was the son of Joshua Fry Bullitt, a former Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals. His ancestors included Colonel John Henry, father of Patrick Henry, Joshua Fry of the College of William & Mary, the Southwest Virginia explorer Thomas Walker, and his great-grandfather, Alexander Scott Bullitt, for whom Bullitt County, Kentucky was named. His first cousins included William Marshall Bullitt, who served as United States Solicitor General during the Taft administration, and who refurbished the family's ancestral home, Oxmoor Farm. Joshua Bullitt Jr. won a scholarship to attend Washington & Lee University, graduating in 1876. He learned the law from his father, and from former U.S. Attorney General James Speed, and by attending the summer lectures of Professor John B. Minor of the University of Virginia Law School, before starting out as a lawyer in 1880. Bullitt served in the Kentucky legislature in 1884 and 1885, and ran for Congress in Virginia in 1896, when the incumbent was James A. Walker. After seven years as a lawyer in Kentucky, Bullitt moved his practice to Big Stone Gap. Big Stone Gap was conceived as a model town, viewed by some to become the \\"Pittsburgh of the South.\\" Two of Bullitt's law partners went on to become prominent judges. Bullitt worked for a time in his law practice with Henry C. McDowell Jr., who later became a federal judge. Bullitt also worked as partner with Joseph L. Kelly, who served on the Virginia Supreme Court. Bullitt served as president of The Virginia Bar Association in 1911‚Äì12. Between 1890 and 1920, Bullitt and his partners represented coal companies in approximately 100 cases before the Virginia Supreme Court, most involving mineral rights or injured miners. \\"Around 1905 Bullitt formed a new partnership with John W. Chalkley. They found ready clients among the many new coal companies. Bullitt became one of a handful of experts on the arcane subject of Appalachian land titles.\\" On the coal lawyer's priorities, land and labor, Bullitt was an opponent of the adoption of the Torrens system of registering land titles in Virginia,The Torrens System: An Open Symposium, The Virginia Law Register, Vol. 11, No. 7 (November 1905) and in a speech to the bar association in 1903, Bullitt predicted the demise of labor unions, concluding that their reason for being would disappear once corporations were reformed.Annual Report of the American Bar Association, 1903 (available on Google Books) Bullitt's main client was the Virginia Coal and Iron Company. The company came to own of land in Lee and Wise counties in Virginia and in Harlan County, Kentucky. Virginia Coal and Iron Company was a predecessor of the Westmoreland Coal Company and the Penn Virginia Corporation. Today, Penn Virginia is listed on the S&P; 600\\\\. The papers of Bullitt's law office are included with the Westmoreland collection at the Hagley Museum and Library in Delaware. Bullitt's son-in-law, Ralph Taggart, became president of Westmoreland in 1929. \\"In 1890, when the coal boom was in full swing,\\" Bullitt \\"organized the Police Guard of Big Stone Gap. The Guard was formed to suppress the more raucous behavior of the mountaineers who periodically poured into town looking for excitement.\\" The Guard and its activities were described by its most famous member, the popular author John Fox Jr.. Fox used Bullitt as the model for the \\"Captain of the Guard\\" character in his best-selling book, The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, and Fox dedicated his earlier book Blue-grass and Rhododendron, published in 1901, to Bullitt and McDowell, along with Horace Ethelbert Fox, as \\"The First Three Captains of the Guard.\\" The Trail of the Lonesome Pine sold more than 1.5 million copies by 1942. The \\"vigilance committee,\\" as the Guard was also known, cleaned up the town in 18 months. The most famous case involving the Guard was the disappearance of Philadelphian E.L. Wentz, a member of the family that included the principal owners of Virginia Coal and Iron Company. In 1904, when the missing body was discovered, Bullitt led his group of men into the woods to guard the remains of the victim, who had not been seen since the fall of the previous year. Bullitt represented the Wentz family at the coroner's inquest, at which the jury reached a surprise verdict that the cause of death was suicide not homicide. Bullitt was the leader of the National Guard unit known as Company \\"H\\" of the Second Virginia Regiment, and that was called to service in Mexico in 1916 and later for World War I. Bullitt concluded his career in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where the owners of many of the coal companies in Wise County, Virginia were based.

It was repeated on Easter Monday, 2008. It borrowed its format from Top Gear of the Pops, a similar one off special which aired as part of Comic Relief 2007. Whereas Top Gear of The Pops combined Top Gear with Top of the Pops, this episode combines the motoring show with Ground Force, a gardening makeover show which ran on the BBC from 1998 to 2005. Regular Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond take over sportsman Steve Redgrave's garden, to dispense advice on creating a zero maintenance lawn, installing an impressive water feature and getting rid of unwanted plants. Naturally, disaster ensues. Top Ground Gear Force was then included as a page in the 2009 Big Book of Top Gear, giving advice to garden problems including concreting the garden over, petrol bombs and flash fires. Title screen Like Top Gear of the Pops, the title screen and music is changed to suit the programme. Instead of having cars in the background, images of gardening were shown instead. The images bore a strong resemblance to the Top Gear title screen (e.g. dirt coming out of a spinning pot, similar to a car wheel spinning and kicking up water from the ground) Hammond was seen pushing a spade into the ground, and then holding it over his shoulder. May was seen holding a wheelbarrow, and breaking a gnome in half (in replacement of him pushing a button on a remote control in the Top Gear title screen). Clarkson was seen with a pair of open hedge trimmers, which he then snaps shut. Ending credits The Top Gear ending credits are also adapted to suit the programme's resemblance to Ground Force ‚Äì the presenters' names were listed as Alan Clarkson, Handy Hammond and Charlie May (references to Ground Force presenters Alan Titchmarsh, Tommy Walsh and Charlie Dimmock respectively). The rest of the crew were all listed as having the first name \\"Monty\\". This 'mocking' was also used in special editions such as the Top Gear Polar Special, in which the presenters' first names were changed to 'Sir Ranulph', as a reference to Sir Ranulph Fiennes. Title irregularities The title Top Ground Gear Force appears during the opening credits and is spoken by the hosts throughout the show. However, the insulated jackets worn by the three hosts are silkscreened with \\"TGGGF\\" on the front chest and \\"Top Garden Ground Gear Force\\" on the rear. Other equipment, such as a flatbed truck, is labeled with the factual title, \\"Top Ground Gear Force\\". This minor detail is not explained throughout the show and may be a simple mistake or an intentional joke. In his book, And On That Bombshell, Richard Porter (Top Gears script editor) explained that the original name was in fact \\"Top Garden Gear Ground Force\\" but the word \\"garden\\" was removed since it is not found in either show's title. Synopsis Clarkson and May 'pretend' to attack Hammond with shovels Rear of Jeremy Clarkson's jacket The Top Gear team of Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond decided, for Sport Relief, to resurrect the show Ground Force, and provide a garden makeover to the garden of one of Britain's sporting legends, namely Sir Steve Redgrave. Helping them was a team of Poles, and on hand to provide advice on Sir Steve's tastes was Ann Redgrave, who was erroneously addressed and referred to as \\"Lady Ann\\" rather than the proper \\"Lady Redgrave\\". As the team's only 'country bumpkin', Hammond decided to designate himself as the team leader. However, his plan to build a 'river of gravel' failed to impress Clarkson and May, who wanted to include a water feature and a shed, respectively. Clarkson also noted that Hammond's river of gravel would pass through one of Redgrave's flowerbeds, which would be particularly difficult to remove. Hammond demonstrates that it is easy to simply dig up each flower with a trowel, Clarkson declares it would take too long, and instead reveals his unique method for removing the flowers using a shotgun. Unimpressed, Hammond sends Clarkson and May to Wyevale Garden Centre to pick up supplies. Deciding to go ahead with his plans to create a 'river of gravel', Hammond uses a small Caterpillar digger to dig a trench in the garden. Meanwhile, Clarkson and May arrive back with their desired equipment, only to destroy the push bike of one of Redgrave's children as they pull into his drive. As May starts work on his shed, Clarkson enlists the help of the Poles to start work on his greenhouse. Meanwhile, unable to control his digger, Hammond crashes it into the trench, leaving it immobile. In an attempt to rectify the situation, he hires a much larger digger to pull the smaller one out of the hole, but due to the digger being extremely heavy, it results in him leaving numerous caterpillar track marks all over the remainder of the garden lawn. Meanwhile, May has just completed work on his shed. Hammond decides to leave both Caterpillars, and instead moves on to his next project - building a round-the-tree seat to be placed at the end of his 'river of gravel'. However, Clarkson quickly points out that despite the seat being complete, Hammond has no way of placing it around the tree, as it has been constructed as a sole piece. Clarkson offers to help Hammond by attempting to prune the tree with his shotgun, allowing the seat to be lifted and then dropped from the top of the tree. However, his gun misfires, and instead blasts a massive hole through the side of May's shed. Meanwhile, Hammond hires a 14-ton crane to lift his seat high enough to slip it over the tree. However, the crane is too heavy, and instead sinks into the lawn, leaving massive holes in it. However, he finds that the crane itself is long enough to still do the job, but his inexperience means that instead of lifting the seat, he moves it sideways, crashing it into and destroying May's shed. May is extremely angry, but Clarkson appears amused by the situation. May starts upon rebuilding the shed, and with the help of the Poles, the shed is quickly reinstated. He begins by labeling where each of the tools in the shed should go, alphabetically ordering the books on the bookshelf, and placing up pictures that he believes will remind Redgrave of his glory days. Meanwhile, Clarkson has the tricky job of removing a rockery in order to build his water feature. He decides to use a homemade bomb to complete the job quickly. The bomb is successful, destroying the rockery in one clean sweep - but the blast is so powerful that the energy manages to blow all of the windows and one of the walls out of May's rebuilt shed, leaving him angrier than ever. May subsequently emerges from the shed and asks Clarkson what time the programme will air. After being informed it was going to air after the watershed, he exclaims at Clarkson, 'you're a fuc-'; at which point, the episode cuts to the next scene. With Hammond at a loose end after the failure of both his 'river of gravel' and his tree seat, he begins to wander aimlessly. Meanwhile, Clarkson has ordered some cement to pave over the parts of the lawn which were destroyed by Hammond's giant digger and 14-ton crane. However, despite his estimations, he orders too little, and only a small portion of the lawn is covered. At this point, The Salvation Army brass band arrive to provide entertainment for the team, but their appearance is cut short when Hammond gets stuck in Clarkson's undried cement, and their musical accompaniment drives Clarkson insane, leading him to bend one of their trombones in half and ask them to leave. With Hammond having ruined Clarkson's cement by leaving footprints in it, Clarkson moves on to his next project - erecting some rugby posts, despite being told that none of Redgrave's family plays rugby. With May having successfully rebuilt his shed again, it's not long before disaster strikes again when Clarkson and the Poles drop the rugby posts, and they fall directly on May's shed, destroying part of the roof and one of the side walls. By this point, May is fuming, and he screams at Clarkson to apologize while pointing a two-by-four at him. After being successfully rescued from the cement, Hammond has moved on to his last project, a turbo-charged barbecue system, which allows the user to cook varieties of meat in under five minutes, using a jet engine to rotate the meat and cook it. Clarkson and May are impressed until the blades begin to rotate too fast, and the chicken is flung off the rotisserie. May and Clarkson are amused by the situation, as all of Hammond's projects so far - the tree seat, river of gravel and barbecue - have all failed, while both May's shed, after being resurrected three times, and Clarkson's greenhouse, have both been successful. However, May's amusement is short-lived when the fire from the barbecue burns out of control and manages to set fire to his once again newly rebuilt shed. Fuming, he attempts to put the fire out before it can take hold, but when Clarkson takes hold of the fire extinguisher, May is forced to watch his shed burn. In the midst of this latest calamity, the team suddenly receives word that Redgrave is now pulling into the drive. Despite two abandoned Caterpillar diggers, an abandoned crane, a burning shed, a ruined lawn and a destructive barbecue, the team are forced to go ahead and unveil the garden to Redgrave. At first, Redgrave is upset at the destruction of his garden, and storms inside his house, leaving the Poles to run away, with Clarkson proclaiming they can 'sense the mood'. Clarkson and May initially attempt to blame the entire debacle on Hammond, but eventually, after Clarkson talking to him privately, Redgrave's mood lightens. Despite all of Hammond and May's projects being failures, Clarkson manages to unveil his proudly built greenhouse and his turbo-charged water feature. Redgrave is slightly impressed until Clarkson activates the water feature. The gush of water is so powerful that it manages to blast the top of the water feature off, sending gallons of water flying up into the air, and the broken half of the water feature crashing down through the greenhouse, smashing all of the windows and destroying some of the wooden structure.

His family's military heritage, his rebellious nature as a youth, his endurance over his treatment as a prisoner of war, his resulting physical limitations, his political persona, his well- known temper, his admitted propensity for controversial or ill-advised remarks, and his devotion to maintaining his large blended family have all defined his place in the American political world more than any ideological or partisan framing (although the latter became more prominent beginning in 2008). Military culture and political character McCain's experiences as a POW have formed the basis for some of his political image. University of Richmond political scientist John Karaagac states that, \\"The military holds a special place in American society and in American democracy. In both war and peace, the military becomes the archetype of democratic values and aspirations... The competing tension of intense institutional loyalty on one hand and guardian of the republic on the other [leads to a situation where] the military view of politics is bound to be ambivalent.\\"Karaagac, John McCain: An Essay in Military and Political History, p. 248. Karaagac then sees McCain as a focal point of this tension and ambivalence. In part, this is due to McCain's family history: public service is idealized in military tradition, whereas politics is deprecated, and this was the tradition in McCain's family as well. Yet McCain's father also served as a Congressional liaison for a while, and was able to be politically effective without seeming overtly so; part of McCain's youth was spent seeing a steady stream of powerful politicians entertained at his family's house. p. 29. When McCain first began his Senate liaison work, he held congressional leaders in poor regard, due to their actions during and after the Vietnam War.Worth the Fighting For, p. 15. But once he began working with them closely, he found a number of them he admired: \\"They were statesmen, and although some of them had never served in uniform, I came to appreciate that most were patriots of the first order.\\" McCain's flight suit and parachute, on display in the North Vietnamese museum at the site of the \\"Hanoi Hilton\\" Hoa Lo Prison. McCain's experiences as a POW have formed the basis for some of his political image. American Prospect editor Michael Tomasky sees McCain's POW experience as being uniquely suited for his country's perceptions of the Vietnam War: \\"It was by suffering in a cell, serving as a kind of metaphor for American suffering in a war most Americans gave up on early in his confinement, but at the same time holding fast to principle under the most unimaginable circumstances, thereby redeeming some notion of American honor in a dishonorable situation, that McCain became an American hero.\\" This assessment is echoed by Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, who says that \\"McCain's is not the heroism of conquest or even rescue, but of endurance, and, even more important, endurance for principle. ... [his] suffering has become in the public imagination a kind of expiation for the war itself. It explains why even people so ideologically distant from him find his experience so moving and his appeal so powerful.\\" The New Republic writer David Grann also concurs in this assessment of McCain's real heroism, but emphasizes that during the 1990s the U.S. national media often overlooked not only political and ideological beliefs of McCain's contrary to theirs, but biographical blemishes as well, in a revival of an old American tradition of hero-building that goes back to Parson Weems. Journalist Andrew Ferguson describes instances where journalists who grew up in the Vietnam era have felt guilt for not having served themselves, and once in contact with McCain have viewed and written favorably about him as a result; the same pattern has been observed by Tomasky and by author David Brock. Longtime Washington journalist Al Hunt states that \\"The hero is indispensable to the McCain persona\\" and sees the courage McCain showed as a prisoner of war directly linked to the courage required to take on \\"the link between money and politics [that] is pervasive throughout American history.\\" Writer Michael Lewis views McCain's political \\"nerve [as] far more interesting than bravery in combat. It was the nerve of a man engaged in an experiment of behaving like a human being when everyone around him was playing this strange, artificial game.\\" McCain on Memorial Day, 2008. He is wearing a Purple Heart. His range of arm motion is limited as the result of his wounds in Vietnam. After many years of observing McCain, New York Times columnist David Brooks writes that \\"there is nobody in politics remotely like him,\\" making reference to his energy and dynamism, his rebelliousness and desire to battle powerful political forces, his willingness to endlessly and truthfully talk with reporters, and his being \\"driven by an ancient sense of honor.\\" Brooks does not see McCain without political fault, but explains that, \\"There have been occasions when McCain compromised his principles for political gain, but he was so bad at it that it always backfired.\\" Vanity Fair national editor Todd Purdum sees McCain's efforts in the years leading up to the 2008 election as \\"trying to make the maverick, freethinking impulses that first made him into a political star somehow compatible with the suck-it-up adherence to the orthodoxies required of a Republican presidential front-runner\\" and compares it to squaring the circle: \\"McCain needs to square that circle, and the hell of it is, he just can't.\\" The New Republic senior editor Jonathan Chait thinks that McCain did not do this, but echoed Brooks by saying, \\"[McCain's] demagoguery comes with an awkward forced smile, which doesn't make it more forgivable but does make it less irritating.\\" Karaagac, though, sees that McCain \\"as Senator, ... understands how to play the game of politics by knowing when to appear above the fracas.\\" McCain practiced the modern American ritual of falling short of ideals, confessing, and moving on; University of Southern California Unruh Institute of Politics Director Dan Schnur, a former McCain campaign spokesperson, says McCain \\"is the best apologizer in politics\\". The past McCain sees two perceptions of himself: \\"I have my reputation ... I'm an independent-minded, well-intentioned public servant to some. And to others, I'm a self-styled, self-righteous, maverick pain in the ass.\\" p. xvii. And while McCain recognizes that deference, finesse, patience, and agility are qualities that are often associated with successful politicians, \\"God has given me heart enough for my ambitions, but too little forbearance to pursue them by routes other than a straight line.\\" Newsweek editor Jon Meacham observes that \\"There is a kind of egotism in McCain‚Äîhe loves attention, always has, and takes glee in confounding the expectations of the institutions of which he is a part.\\" City University of New York political science professor Stanley A. Renshon found that trait theory does not adequately explain McCain's behavior as a political figure, and that McCain's interior psychology includes a variety of aspects that defy simple analysis in terms of how he might perform in higher leadership roles. McCain is a lifelong gambler, from his early military days of playing poker, craps, and roulette and running a friendly Bachelor Officer Quarters gambling den while off-duty in Florida and Texas,Timberg, An American Odyssey, pp. 66‚Äì68. to traveling periodically to Las Vegas for weekend-long betting marathons while senator. McCain had a history, beginning with his military career, of appealing to lucky charms and superstitions to gain fortune. While serving in Vietnam, he demanded that his parachute rigger clean his visor before each flight. On his 2000 presidential campaign, he carried a lucky compass, feather, shoes, pen, penny and, at times, a rock. An incident when McCain misplaced his feather caused a brief panic in the campaign. The night before the 2008 New Hampshire primary he slept on the same side of the bed in the same hotel room he had stayed in before his win there in 2000, and after winning carried some of his talismans forward into the following Michigan primary supplemented by others. His superstitions are extended to others; to those afraid of flying or experiencing a bumpy flight, he says, \\"You don't need to worry. I've crashed four fighter jets, and I'm not going to die in a plane crash. You're safe with me.\\" McCain's war wounds left him incapable of raising his arms above his head; he was unable to attend to his own hair and he sometimes required assistance in dressing, tasks performed by nearby aides. His former communications director has said, \\"You comb someone's hair once, and you never forget it.\\" McCain was treated for recurrent skin cancer, including melanoma, in 1993, 2000, and 2002;\\"Just the facts about McCain\\", The Arizona Republic. 2006-09-18. Retrieved on 2006-11-17. one of the resulting operations left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face. These medical conditions, combined with his advancing years, led him to repeatedly use a self- deprecating remark during his 2008 presidential campaigning: \\"I am older than dirt and have more scars than Frankenstein.\\" Political character and public response thumb|upright|rightCongressional portrait. McCain's own emphasis on personal character in his appeal to voters was revealed in a University of Missouri study of political discourse in the 2000 Republican primary campaign, which showed McCain using fewer policy, and more character, utterances than any other candidate. p. 96. Another study of the campaign, by University of North Florida communications professor John Parmelee, performed a framing theory analysis of a McCain campaign videocassette sent to voters; it found the video's narrative sought to connect values from McCain's personal life and war record to his political courage and then his political platform. Unlike rival George W. Bush's campaign videocassette, McCain's did not shy away from negative aspects of his personal history, but instead sought to frame his divorce as a chapter in his character-building POW experience. McCain's appeal has usually not been based on party identification: University of California, San Diego political science professor Gary Jacobson's 2006 study of partisan polarization found that in a state-by-state survey of job approval ratings of the state's senators, McCain had the seventh-smallest partisan difference of any senator, with a 2.6 percentage point difference in approval between Arizona's Republicans and Democrats. Likewise, an April 2008 Gallup poll found that the public perception of him as a war hero was not strongly weighted by party identification (unlike the case in 2004 for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry). While McCain's Gallup poll favorability ratings were beaten down during the course of the 2008 U.S. presidential election, they rebounded to previous levels within days of his defeat. Nor has conventional ideology defined him: Arizona Republic columnist and RealClearPolitics contributor Robert Robb, using a formulation devised by William F. Buckley Jr., describes McCain as \\"conservative\\" but not \\"a conservative\\", meaning that while McCain usually tends towards conservative positions, he is not \\"anchored by the philosophical tenets of modern American conservatism.\\" New Yorker writer George Packer says of McCain, \\"He doesn‚Äôt present himself as a conservative leader; he is simply a leader.\\" Reason and Los Angeles Times writer Matt Welch, author of McCain: The Myth of a Maverick, sees political pundits as projecting their own ideological fantasies upon McCain, with the result that McCain's \\"maverick\\" persona shields his actual goals for the nation and national culture. McCain called himself \\"a Teddy Roosevelt conservative\\", and indeed Welch sees Theodore Roosevelt as the main governmental role model for McCain, and writes that McCain believes in effectively statist solutions that will facilitate the notion \\"that Americans 'were meant to transform history' and that sublimating the individual in the service of that 'common national cause' is the wellspring of honor and purpose.\\" An Arizona Republic analysis of Senate votes from 1999 to 2008 found that McCain broke with his party in about a quarter of the close votes where his stance could make a difference, but almost never in the years he was running for president. However, McCain's Senate stances on signature issues of campaign finance reform in 1999 and comprehensive immigration reform in 2007, while not resulting in very close Senate votes, significantly damaged his presidential prospects in both years. \\"What happened to John McCain?\\" By the time of the 2008 general election season, the nature of some of the McCain campaign's tactics had tipped the balance of past respect for some observers. Washington Post columnist and past McCain admirer Richard Cohen said that \\"the John McCain of old is unrecognizable. He has become the sort of politician he once despised.\\" Writer Michael Kinsley noted falsehoods stated by the McCain campaign and ponders whether it will be \\"necessary to wait for one of McCain‚Äôs conveniently delayed conversions to righteousness.\\" This trend continued during the Obama administration and during McCain's 2010 senate re-election campaign. As McCain shed his past contraorthodox positions and explicitly repudiated the very 'maverick' label itself, The Politico concluded that \\"by seeming to do anything to win re-election McCain has torched one of the most famous brands in modern American politics,\\" and Fox News echoed the same sentiment by writing that \\"McCain abandoned his maverick label and cast aside one of the most powerful brands in American politics as he fought to reassure conservatives they could trust him.\\" The change caused writers to reassess and question their past conclusions about McCain. David Margolick, writing for Newsweek magazine, wondered: \\"His dramatic shifts raise several questions: How much of his maverick persona over the years has been real and how much simply tactical? Is he in the midst of some struggle for his soul, or is this evolution simply the latest example, dating back to his days at the Hanoi Hilton, of McCain doing whatever it takes to survive? Is the anger people sense in him anger at Obama, or the American electorate, or fate, or himself?\\" James Fallows of The Atlantic saw McCain as going against the usual trend of public figures becoming more broad-minded as they get older and concluded, \\"John McCain seems intentionally to be shrinking his audience, his base, and his standing in history. It's unnecessary, and it is sad.\\" Writer Niall O'Dowd wrote that McCain had been \\"a remarkable man, true to his own vision of where true north was on his compass,\\" but then, \\"something happened ... In his place is this crotchety naysayer who has lost all track of his better self and his better angels.\\" Todd Purdum, whose long, largely favorable treatment of McCain in an early 2007 issue of Vanity Fair had been titled \\"Prisoner of Conscience\\", wrote a far more bitter piece for the same publication in late 2010 entitled \\"The Man Who Never Was\\". Writers began to seek explanations for what had happened to the John McCain they thought they knew. Explanations varied: political survival, political expediency, the departure of alter-ego Mark Salter, personal antipathy towards Obama, resentment at Obama's election. New York Times columnist Gail Collins snarked simply: \\"But that was the old John McCain, before he was kidnapped by space aliens and reprogrammed.\\" Several writers sought to frame McCain's career as actually consistent, when viewed through different prisms. Matt Welch acknowledged that McCain had made a series of \\"crude reversals\\" in his political positions, but also extrapolated upon his previous analysis of McCain and wrote that some of the shifts were actually not, and could be explained by virtue of his generational military heritage and that \\"McCain's core, almost genetic, principle in governance and life is that the United States should remain the unchallenged military superpower keeping the world safe for democracy and commerce.\\" Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein wrote that McCain's career is better explained by looking at electoral opportunities and his personal resentments at the time than by political or policy positions. Purdum amplified on both these themes and wrote that McCain's political self was connected to his warrior past: \\"McCain has always lived for the fight, and he has defined himself most clearly in opposition to an enemy, whether that enemy was the rule-bound leadership of the United States Naval Academy, his North Vietnamese captors, the hometown Arizona press corps that never much liked him, his Republican congressional colleagues, the Reverend Jerry Falwell, George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Barack Obama, or J. D. Hayworth. He has always been more of an existential politician than a consequential one, in the sense that his influence has derived not from steady, unswerving pursuit of philosophical goals or legislative achievements but from the series of unpredictable‚Äîand sometimes spectacular‚Äîfights he has chosen to pick.\\" During 2013, several Congressional negotiations showed that McCain now had improved relations with the Obama administration, including the president himself, as well as with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and that he had become the leader of a power center in the Senate for cutting deals in an otherwise bitterly partisan environment.\\"The new power triangle\\", Politico (July 23, 2013).

By the end of 2013, journalist Mark Leibovich sought to sum up the John McCain of the moment, and wrote: Temperament Journalist Adam Clymer notes of McCain that, \\"There is no question that he sometimes loses potential allies by his penchant for telling off other senators.\\" Todd Purdum remarks upon a \\"temperament that routinely put[s] him atop insiders' lists of the most difficult senators on Capitol Hill.\\" A 2006 Washingtonian survey of Capitol Hill staff ranked McCain as having the second \\"Hottest Temper\\" in the Senate. Former Senator Rick Santorum says that, \\"John was very rough in the sandbox. Everybody has a McCain story. If you work in the Senate for a while, you have a McCain story. ... He hasn't built up a lot of goodwill.\\" Writer Elizabeth Drew quoted a senator who admired McCain as saying, \\"Dealing with John McCain is kind of like dancing with a cactus.\\" p. 23. In 1989, McCain screamed at Senator Richard Shelby an inch from his face, during a heated cabinet nomination battle for McCain's friend John Tower. McCain aide Mark Salter challenged the accuracy of other elements of Leahy's article; see In 1992, McCain and Senator Chuck Grassley got into a heated argument, with shoving and profanities, over a POW/MIA committee issue and did not speak to each other for two years, before reconciling. At a meeting in 2007 on immigration legislation, fellow Republican Senator John Cornyn objected to McCain: \\"Wait a second here. I've been sitting in here for all of these negotiations and you just parachute in here on the last day. You're out of line,\\" to which McCain replied, \\"Fuck you! I know more about this than anyone else in the room.\\" McCain had stated: \\"It is apparent that I'm not the most popular member of the Senate.\\"Worth the Fighting For, p. xvi. The Almanac of American Politics comments that \\"[McCain's] opposition to what he considers pork barrel spending ... provides him plenty of material for his self-deprecating jokes about how unpopular he is with many colleagues.\\" p. 95. Regarding his temper, or what cultural writer Julia Keller characterizes as passionate conviction, ‚Äúwe ‚Ä¶ want people in public life to be passionate and engaged. We want them to be fiery and feisty. We like them to care enough to blow their stacks every once in a while. Otherwise, we question the sincerity of their convictions.‚Äù McCain acknowledges it, ‚ÄúI have‚Äîalthough certainly not in recent years‚Äîlost my temper and said intemperate things‚Ä¶.I feel passionately about issues, and the day that passion goes away is the day I will go down to the old soldiers' home and find my rocking chair.‚Äù while also saying that the stories have been exaggerated. ‚ÄúI am very happy to be a passionate man‚Ä¶.many times I deal passionately when I find things that are not in the best interests of the American people. And so, look, 20, 25 years ago, 15 years ago, that's fine, and those stories here are either totally untrue or grossly exaggerated.\\" Renshon notes that having a temper is not unusual for U.S. leaders, with George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton among those sharing the trait. p. 245: ‚ÄúMcCain was not the only candidate or leader to have a temper.‚Äù McCain employed both profanity and shouting on occasion. Adam Clymer sees McCain's nature as possibly misfit for the Senate: \\"McCain is an impatient man‚Äîperhaps because he lost five years of his life as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam‚Äîin an institution that worships delay and rewards endurance.\\" George \\"Bud\\" Day, McCain's former POW cellmate and subsequent lifelong friend, found McCain's temperament in the Senate amusingly consistent with his past practice of going around the POW camp, taunting and yelling obscenities at the North Vietnamese guards. p. 297. Phillip Butler, who knew McCain at the Naval Academy and was also a POW with him, said, \\"John has an infamous reputation for being a hot head.\\" McCain's sometimes explosive temper was an integral part of his somewhat unorthodox, but effective and admired, leadership style when he was commanding officer of the VA-174 naval air squadron in the mid-1970s. Such incidents have become less frequent over the years: ‚Äúthe past few years have seen fewer McCain outbursts, prompting some senators and aides to suggest privately that he is working to control his temper.‚Äù senators supporting his 2008 presidential campaign said that McCain had calmed down during the 2000s, and reporters have noted almost no flare-ups during the 2008 presidential campaign. Senator Susan Collins, who endorsed McCain in the 2008 primaries on the basis of his character and not his political positions, said, \\"People tend to feel very strongly about John both ways.\\" Senator Thad Cochran, who has known McCain and the McCain family for decades and has battled McCain over earmarks, represents one view: \\"The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He is erratic. He is hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.\\" Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president, after it was clear he would win the nomination. Senator Joseph Lieberman, an enthusiastic cross-party 2008 McCain backer, represents the other view with this observation: \\"[McCain's] is not the kind of anger that is a loss of control. He is a very controlled person.\\" Following the election, there have been occasional in-Senate flare-ups, such as during the December 2010 debate over repeal of the U.S. military's \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" policy. Reconciliations were possible too: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had said in 2008, \\"I can't stand John McCain,\\" but by 2013, after successfully working with him on several negotiations, Reid said, \\"I worked with him for 31 years. And we've had some pretty difficult times together, but in the 31 years we've worked together, there is no one I have ever worked with that is more a man of his word or a person of his word than John McCain.\\" McCain's relations with his own Senate staff have reflected less tension: doors to his office were usually kept open and staffers called him by his first name.Drew, Citizen McCain, pp. 21‚Äì22. Moreover, staffers stayed with his office for an unusually long time, over eight years on average at one point. And McCain's senior campaign staff have shown a passionate loyalty towards him, a loyalty that continues even from people who have been forced to leave his campaign after intra-staff squabbles. McCain had many run-ins and heated confrontations with people in Arizona political circles, but a number of them would become his campaign contributors. Controversial remarks Senator McCain with the American flag in the background The characteristics that led to McCain gaining hundreds of demerits at the Naval Academy have never fully left him; by his own admission, he has an \\"irremediable\\" personality trait of being \\"a wiseass,\\" and as he added: \\"Occasionally my sense of humor is ill- considered or ill-timed, and that can be a problem.\\" Others have concurred: A 2007 Associated Press story was titled \\"McCain's WMD Is a Mouth That Won't Quit\\", while in 2008, The Politico described McCain's humor as \\"rooted in a time before there was political correctness\\" and a characteristic that is viewed either as a mark of authenticity or as out of touch with contemporary mores. Over the years this trait has led to a series of controversial remarks, with targets both domestic and foreign. In 1986, Representative McCain was reported to have joked about a woman enjoying being raped by a gorilla, when speaking at a conference of the National League of Cities and Towns in Washington, D.C.The Humor DeficitNo joking matter for McCain Other reports put the alleged rape joke in 1984 rather than 1986.Bodfield, Rhonda. ‚ÄúMcCain's gaffes no joke as 2000 looms‚Äù, Arizona Daily Star (1998-06-16). Retrieved 2008-07-19. McCain said in the 1980s that he did not recall telling that joke. In his 1986 Senate campaign, at a college appearance he referred to Arizona's Leisure World retirement community as \\"Seizure World\\", remarking that in the previous election, \\"97 percent of the people who live there came out to vote. I think the other 3 percent were in intensive care.\\"Timberg, An American Odyssey, pp. 161‚Äì162. While the young audience laughed, his Democratic opponent soon jumped on the remark; McCain would later concede that it was a joke whose offense he made worse when he did not quickly apologize for it.Worth the Fighting For, p. 114. In 1998, McCain made a joke during a speech at a Republican fundraiser about President Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, saying: \\"Why is Chelsea Clinton so ugly? Because her father is Janet Reno.\\" Attorney General Reno had frequently been portrayed by a male (Will Ferrell) on national television. And, Chelsea Clinton had frequently been characterized in the media as \\"gawky\\". The joke was thought so offensive that many newspapers declined to print it verbatim; McCain's biographer Robert Timberg would characterize it as \\"an unspeakable thing to say, unworthy of him.\\"Timberg, An American Odyssey, p. 194. McCain subsequently said: \\"This is the bad boy. It was stupid and cruel and insensitive. I've apologized. I can't take it back.\\" His letter of apology to President Clinton was described as \\"abject, contrite, and profuse.\\" In response, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said: \\"To make a further issue of the matter would lend further exposure to an offensive joke. In light of the senator's apology, they [the first family] decided to drop the matter.\\" A White House aide also noted the working relationship between McCain and the president, saying \\"You're not gonna hear any smack from us; he's our bud over here.\\" In the 2000 Presidential race, McCain stated that \\"I hate the gooks,\\" and that \\"I will hate them as long as I live.\\" Until the year 2000, McCain used the ethnic slur \\"gook\\" in reference to the individuals who had tortured him in Vietnam, and reaction among Vietnamese Americans to McCain's use of this term was mixed, but they were generally supportive of McCain's candidacy, for example as shown in exit polls in the primary in California. During his presidential campaign that year, he at first refused to apologize for his continued use of the term, stating that he reserved its reference only to his captors; then after continued criticism from some in the Asian American community, McCain vowed to no longer use the term, saying, \\"I will continue to condemn those who unfairly mistreated us. But out of respect to a great number of people for whom I hold in very high regard, I will no longer use the term that has caused such discomfort.\\" At a VFW Hall in South Carolina in 2007, a veteran asked when the U.S. would \\"send an air mail message to Iran.\\" McCain jokingly responded by singing \\"Bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran,\\" to the tune of The Beach Boys' \\"Barbara Ann\\" (from the 1980 \\"Bomb Iran\\" song parody by Vince Vance & The Valiants), and then seriously explained his concerns about Iran while stopping short of a bombing endorsement. When later asked about the singing, McCain stated, \\"My response is: lighten up and get a life.\\" Asked whether it was insensitive, McCain retorted, \\"Insensitive to what? The Iranians?\\" As a guest on The Daily Show a few days later in 2007, and following a trip to Baghdad, host and longtime friend Jon Stewart asked McCain, \\"What do you want to start with, the bomb Iran song or the walk through the market in Baghdad?\\" McCain responded by saying, \\"I think maybe shopping in Baghdad ... I had something picked out for you, too‚Äîa little IED to put on your desk.\\" When anti-Iraq-war Democrats objected to the remark, McCain advised that they too, \\"Lighten up and get a life.\\" Traditions and family John and Cindy McCain, c. 2007 McCain emphasized the role in his life of the family tradition of service to one's country, as exemplified by his father and grandfather; it was the predominant theme of his 1999 memoir Faith of My Fathers. Both his forebears had difficulty coping with the end of war; his grandfather felt listless and died several days after the formal conclusion of World War II, while his father felt despair over his reluctant retirement from the United States Navy and fell into prolonged poor health afterwards.Worth the Fighting For, pp. 3‚Äì4. McCain felt that his father's \\"long years of binge drinking\\" had caught up with him, despite his mostly successful subsequent recovery in Alcoholics Anonymous. McCain had been troubled by the sporadic manifestations of his father's alcoholism while growing up, and Matt Welch saw McCain's experience of living with that, as well as witnessing his wife Cindy's three-year addiction to painkillers in the early 1990s, as causing his speech and writings to be populated with the language and emotions of twelve-step programs. In particular, Welch saw McCain as \\"disarmingly talented at admitting his narcissistic flaws\\" and constantly seeking to invest in a cause greater than self-interest. McCain is known for his responses to attacks upon his family. An opponent of his in the 1982 Republican House primary contacted his first wife Carol, seeking negative material on McCain.Timberg, An American Odyssey, pp. 144‚Äì145. She refused to discuss her marriage, and then next time McCain met the opponent, he said: \\"I understand you called my ex-wife. I want you to know that, campaign aside, politics aside, you ever do anything like that again, anything against a person in my family, I will personally beat the shit out of you.\\" The smear campaign against his adopted Bangladeshi daughter during the 2000 South Carolina presidential primary so bothered him that, by some accounts, he considered leaving the Republican Party. Cindy and John McCain look on as their son Jimmy pins naval aviator's wings on their son Ensign John S. McCain IV, at a January 2011 ceremony at Naval Air Station Whiting Field The traditions McCain was brought up under have extended to his own family. His son John Sidney IV (\\"Jack\\") enrolled at the U.S. Naval Academy and graduated in 2009, after which he went to Naval Air Station Pensacola for training as a naval aviator, just as his father had, followed by helicopter pilot training at Naval Air Station Whiting Field, where he graduated from in January 2011. He was subsequently assigned to the HSC-25 \\"Island Knights\\" squadron in Guam, flying the MH-60S Knighthawk. His son James (\\"Jimmy\\") enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 2006, began recruit training later that year, and by early 2008 was a Lance Corporal who had served a tour of duty as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He subsequently served a second tour in Iraq as well, then left to attend college, with possible plans to return to the Marines. His daughter Meghan graduated from Columbia University, worked and blogged on his presidential campaign, and subsequently became a blogging, Twittering, and book publishing fixture on the Republican Party scene with some of the same maverick tendencies as her father.Parker, Kathleen. \\"Another McCain Throws Down a Challenge\\", The Washington Post (March 25, 2009). Retrieved May 25, 2009. His daughter Bridget is a student at Arizona State University. From his first marriage, his son Doug graduated from the University of Virginia, became a Navy A-6E Intruder carrier pilot, then a commercial pilot for American Airlines; his son Andrew is vice president and CFO at Hensley & Co. and chair of the Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce; and his daughter Sidney is a recording industry executive living in Toronto who has worked for Capitol Records and V2 Records. Altogether he has seven children, born across four decades, including three with Carol‚Äîall of whom are reported to be on good terms with him, his wife, and each other‚Äîand, , four grandchildren. Cindy McCain suffered a stroke in 2004 due to high blood pressure, but made a mostly full recovery.

More broadly, he identified himself as a Christian rather than an evangelical Christian. Most people know him as being a maverick in the political arena, but he was also a friend of ISKCON devotees. He used to greet them with saying ‚ÄúHare Krishna!‚Äù, and accepted copies of Bhagavad-gita As It Is and sacred garlands from them on several occasions.

It explores issues of gender and sexual identity while following the personal stories of some of the patients at a Tehran gender reassignment clinic. The film played at the Sundance Film Festival and the Berlin International Film Festival, winning three awards. Overview Although homosexual relationships are illegal (punishable by death) in Iran, sex reassignment operations are permitted. In 1987, Islamic leader Ayatollah Khomeini passed a fatwa allowing sex-change operations as a cure for \\"diagnosed transsexuals\\". Be Like Others shows the experiences of male and female patients at Dr. Bahram Mir-Jalali's Mirdamad Surgical Centre, a sex-reassignment clinic in Tehran. One of them is Ali Askar, a 24-year-old man who faces harassment from other men due to his feminine appearance and behaviour. He does not want to become a woman but sees no other options for him in Iranian society. He decides to go ahead with the surgery despite death threats from his father and finds support from Vida, a post-operative transsexual he meets at the clinic. By the end of the film, Ali has become a woman named Negar. She has been disowned by her family, experienced depression and has had to work as a prostitute. Twenty-year-old Anoosh is another young man who has been ostracised due to his femininity. His boyfriend feels more comfortable when Anoosh dresses as a woman, and in contrast to Ali, Anoosh's mother is supportive of his desire to change sex. The end of the film shows Anoosh ‚Äì now Anahita ‚Äì happy and engaged to her boyfriend. However, her boyfriend has become increasingly distant since Anahita had her surgery. Throughout the film, the patients of the sex- reassignment clinic assert that they are not homosexual, seeing homosexuality as something that is shameful and immoral. Eshaghian's opinion is that this shame is the driving force behind so many Iranians deciding to change their sex. She says that identifying as transsexual rather than homosexual allows them to live free from harassment. At first, Westerners may find the Iranian state's support of sex change operations contradictory in light of their views on homosexuality. However, Be Like Others reveals the reasoning behind this apparent disagreement: while homosexuality is considered a shameful choice, transsexuality is thought of as a curable mental illness. Dr. Bahram Mir- Jalali, performs more sex-change operations in a year than the entire country of France does in 10 years. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has notoriously proclaimed that there are no homosexuals in Iran, as it is clear that homosexuality has become interchangeable with transsexuality due to fear and repression. The film walks us through the lives of individuals undergoing this procedure and gives us a look into what life is like afterwards. Production Eshaghian, an Iranian American film-maker, got the idea for Be Like Others after reading a 2004 New York Times article about sex-change operations happening in Iran and being surprised that such an operation would be acceptable in a Muslim country. She wrote a proposal for a film and tried to find funding, but was unsuccessful. She contacted a British journalist who had written on the subject and he gave her telephone numbers for Dr. Bahram Mir-Jalali and the Muslim cleric featured in the film. To find subjects, she visited the predominant sex-reassignment clinic in Iran, and spent time in the waiting-room talking to patients and their families. She found that female-to- male transsexuals were generally very successful in living as their new gender and as a result were reluctant to take part in the documentary for fear of being \\"outed\\" as transsexual. She felt that the contrasting stories of Ali and Anoosh highlighted the importance of family bonds in Iranian society. At a question and answer session at the Sundance Film Festival, Eshaghian said that one of the men she met while filming decided to live as a gay man rather than become a woman, and that she is now trying to help him leave Iran. Distribution and reception In 2008, Be Like Others was screened at the Sundance Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize and the Berlin International Film Festival where it won three Teddy Awards; the Amnesty International Film Prize ‚Äì Special Mention, Reader Jury of the Siegess√§ule and the Jury Award. The film was shown on BBC television as Transsexual in Iran in February 2008. It screened at the Seattle International Film Festival in June 2008. Writing for Variety, Robert Koehler called Be Like Others \\"a powerful window into a once-hidden side of the country\\" and \\"a model of non-dogmatic filmmaking on a highly charged topic.\\" In 2010, Be Like Others was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for \\"Outstanding Documentary\\" during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards. In 2012, the film screened at the Noor Iranian Film Festival and won Best Documentary.

In 2002, he published a grammatical description of Araki, a language spoken by a handful of speakers on an islet south of Espiritu Santo (Vanuatu).Fran√ßois (2002). Most of his research focuses on the northern islands of Vanuatu, known as the Torres and Banks Islands, an area where seventeen languages are still spoken: Hiw, Lo-Toga, Lehali, L√∂y√∂p, Mwotlap, Volow, Lemerig, Vera'a, Vur√´s, Mwesen, Mota, Nume, Dorig, Koro, Olrat, Lakon, Mwerlap. After describing Mwotlap,Fran√ßois (2003); Fran√ßois (2019). the language with most speakers in that area, he has published articles comparing the languages of the area more generally ‚Äì both from a synchronic and historical perspectives. He has described the sociolinguistic profile of this area as one of ‚Äúegalitarian multilingualism‚Äù.Fran√ßois (2012). In 2005, Fran√ßois took part in a scientific expedition to Vanikoro (Solomon islands), whose objective was to understand the wreckage of the French navigator La P√©rouse in 1788. As a member of a multidisciplinary team, he recorded the oral tradition of the Melanesian and Polynesian populations of this island, concerning popular representations of this historical event.. On that occasion, he also documented the three languages spoken on Vanikoro ‚Äì Teanu, Lovono and Tanema ‚Äì two of which are highly endangered. Fran√ßois (2009). In 2015, he coauthored with Jean-Michel Charpentier the Linguistic Atlas of French Polynesia, an atlas showcasing the internal linguistic diversity of French Polynesia.Charpentier & Fran√ßois (2015). In 2020, he was elected a member of the Academia Europaea. =Documentation of languages and cultures in Melanesia= Fran√ßois recorded texts from the oral literature ‚Äì myths, legends, folktales ‚Äì in various language communities of Vanuatu and the Solomons. He provided local communities with various books in their languages, in the perspective of promoting the use of vernacular languages in writing.‚ÄúBuilding up vernacular literacy‚Äù with free access to literacy materials. Together with ethnomusicologist Monika Stern and anthropologist √âric Wittersheim, he ran a multidisciplinary project on traditional music and poetry in Vanuatu.The Poet‚Äôs Salary (2009), award-winning documentary by √âric Wittersheim, about Fran√ßois' and Stern's fieldwork in northern Vanuatu. This led to the publication of Music of Vanuatu: Celebrations and Mysteries, a CD album of songs and dances recorded during social events in the field.Fran√ßois & Stern (2013). =Contribution to linguistic typology and theory= Fran√ßois coined the term ‚Äúcolexification‚Äù.Fran√ßois (2008). This term captures the fact that certain concepts, which some languages distinguish in their lexicons, are encoded in the same way (‚Äúcolexified‚Äù) in other languages. Colexification is increasingly used in research about lexical typology. Together with Siva Kalyan (ANU), he also developed Historical glottometry, a non-cladistic approach to language genealogy, inspired by the Wave model.Fran√ßois (2014), Kalyan & Fran√ßois (2018).

While professor of nursing at New York University, Rogers developed the \\"Science of Unitary Human Beings\\", a body of ideas that she described in her book An Introduction to the Theoretical Basis of Nursing.  Early life and education  She was born in Dallas, Texas, the oldest of four children of Bruce Taylor Rogers and Lucy Mulholland Keener Rogers. She began college at the University of Tennessee, studying pre-med (1931-1933) and withdrew due to pressure that medicine was an unsuitable career for a woman. She received a diploma from the Knoxville General Hospital School of Nursing in 1936. The following year she received an undergraduate degree in public health nursing at George Peabody College in Nashville, Tennessee.ref name=\\"Tomey\\">Tomey, A. M. & Alligood, M. R. (1998).

In 1996, she was posthumously inducted into the American Nurses Association's Hall of Fame.http://www.nursingworld.org/MarthaElizabethRogers American Nurses Association  Nursing theory  Rogers' theory is known as the Science of Unitary Human Beings. Its primary tenets include the following:Rogers, M. E. (1989). An Introduction to the Theoretical Basis of Nursing. Philadelphia: F. A. Davis * Nursing is both a science and art; the uniqueness of nursing, like that of any other science, lies in the phenomenon central to its focus. * Nurses‚Äô long-established concern with the people and the world they live is a natural forerunner of an organized abstract system encompassing people and their environments. * The irreducible nature of individuals is more than the sum of the parts. * The integralness of people and the environment that coordinate with a multidimensional universe of open systems points to a new paradigm: the identity of nursing as a science. * The purpose of nursing is to promote health and wellbeing for all persons wherever they are. A form of energy medicine, the Science of Unitary Human Beings is based on the idea that \\"human beings and environment are energy fields\\" that are characterized by \\"four-dimensionality\\", a \\"nonlinear domain without spatial or temporal attributes\\"; postulates that physicist Alan Sokal describes as \\"pseudoscientific verbiage\\" and \\"perfectly meaningless\\". Jef Raskin wrote that Rogers' writings were filled with contradictions, \\"fuzzy physics,\\" and vagaries. \\"Unlike science, nursing theory has no built-in mechanisms for rejecting falsehoods, tautologies, and irrelevancies.\\"  Publications  * Educational Revolution in Nursing (1961) * Reveille in Nursing (1964) * An Introduction to the Theoretical Basis of Nursing (1970)  References  1914 births 1994 deaths American nurses American women nurses Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health alumni New York University faculty Nursing theorists Nursing researchers Teachers College, Columbia University alumni Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health ","title":"Martha E.

According to the Irish annals, he was High King of Ireland. Sons of √Åed Sl√°ine Peoples and kingdoms in early Ireland. Blathmac's father √Åed Sl√°ine was a son of Diarmait mac Cerbaill, the apical ancestor of the southern branches of the U√≠ N√©ill kindred which dominated Ireland from the late 6th century until the rise of Brian B√≥ruma in the late 10th century. The descendants of √Åed Sl√°ine were known as the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine. With the possible exception of √ìengus mac Colm√°in, all U√≠ N√©ill kings descended from Diarmait mac Cerbaill belonged to the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine until the death of Cin√°ed mac √çrgalaig in 728. The S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine were Kings of Brega, and the Hill of Tara, where High Kings were inaugurated, lay within their lands. Other groups descended from the sons of Diarmait included Clann Cholm√°in, or more precisely Clann Cholm√°in M√°ir, descended from Colm√°n M√°r, which replaced the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine as the dominant group of the southern U√≠ N√©ill from the middle of the 8th century, and the less important Ca√≠lle Follamain or Clann Cholm√°in Bicc, descended from Colm√°n Beg. √Åed Sl√°ine himself is said to have been High King jointly with Colm√°n R√≠mid of the northern Cen√©l nE√≥gain branch of the U√≠ N√©ill, following the death of √Åed mac Ainmuirech. √Åed Sl√°ine died circa 604, a death said to have been prophesied by Saint Columba. √Åed's sons are said to have included Blathmac, Diarmait (died 665), Congal (died 634), Ailill (died 634), and D√∫nchad (died 659). Domnall mac √Åedo and Congal C√°ech Blathmac was one of the younger sons of √Åed Sl√°ine. According to king lists, the kingship of Brega was held by Congal and then by Ailill, both killed by Congal mac Suibni of Clann Cholm√°in in 634, who had also killed √Åed Sl√°ine in 604. After this Blathmac and Diarmait were jointly kings of Brega. Diarmait killed Congal mac Suibni \\"in the house of Nad-Fra√≠ch's son\\" according to the Annals of Ulster, in 635. That same year Diarmait defeated Clann Cholm√°in Bicc in battle at C√∫il Cael√°in where √ìengus mac Colm√°in's son M√°el Umai was killed. Blathmac is not mentioned in these reports. At this time the High Kingship of Ireland may have been disputed between Domnall mac √Åedo of the northern Cen√©l Conaill branch of the U√≠ N√©ill and the cruithne king Congal C√°ech. In this complicated contest Blathmac and Diarmait were allied with Domnall. They fought alongside him at the Battle of Mag Rath where Congal was killed. Some branches of the U√≠ N√©ill fought against Domnall, among them Conall mac Suibni's son Airmedach who died there. High King The compilers of the various Irish annals were apparently uncertain as to the succession following the death of Domnall mac √Åedo in 642. The Annals of Ulster state: > Here it is uncertain who reigned after Domnall. Some historiographers state > that four kings, i.e. Cellach, Conall C√≥el, and two sons of Aed Sl√°ine son > of Diarmait son of Fergus Cerrb√©l son of Conall of Cremthann son of Niall > No√≠giallach, namely Diarmait and Blathmac, reigned in mingled rule. According to the late 7th century Baile Chuind Ch√©tchathaig, a list of High Kings composed in the reign of Blathmac's nephew F√≠nsnechta Fledach, son of D√∫nchad, Domnall mac √Åedo was succeeded by Blathmac and Diarmait. The Baile Chuind omits several kings, including √Åed Sl√°ine, some of which may be copying errors, but others are apparently deliberate. It is a work of dynastic propaganda, its purpose to demonstrate that the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine should by right be High Kings of Ireland. For these reasons, although it is the most nearly contemporary witness, it is not necessarily to be trusted. Of the two or four kings, Diarmait was the most active according to the record which survives in the Irish annals. Relatively little is reported of Blathmac. The deaths of three of his sons are recorded during his lifetime. The death of Eochaid in 660 is reported without explanation, but the notice of the killing of D√∫nchad and Conall in 651 is accompanied by some gnomic verses. These appear to associate the killings with one M√°elodr√°n, a Leinsterman. A variant on these events appears in the Orgguin Tr√≠ Mac D√≠armata mic Cerbaill (The Slaying of the Three Sons of D√≠armait mac Cerbaill), perhaps composed in the Old Irish language period. This makes D√∫nchad and Conall, and also M√°elodor, sons of Diarmait mac Cerbaill and their killer the D√°l Messin Corb hero M√°elodr√°n mac D√≠mma Chr√≥in. Diarmait's sons flee from M√°elodr√°n and hide in a mill where they are crushed. A plague arrived in Ireland in 664, called the buide Chonaill. The annals record that Blathmac and Diarmait both died of the disease the following year. The king lists have them followed by Blathmac's son Sechnassach, possibly ruling jointly with another son of Blathmac, Cenn F√°elad. Descendants and posterity Blathmac's five recorded sons have already been mentioned: Sechnassach and Cenn F√°elad who survived him and D√∫nchad, Conall and Eochaid, who pre-deceased him. None of Blathmac's later descendants were major figures. For editors and creators of Middle Irish language literature, the reign of Blathmac and Diarmait was imagined as a Golden Age. Works set in this period include the Cath Cairnd Chonaill and the Sc√©la Cano meic Gartn√°in.

Brooks (born 1937) served as North Carolina Commissioner of Labor from 1977 to 1993. Early life Brooks, a native of Greenville, North Carolina, is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (with a Morehead-Cain Scholarship), and the University of Chicago law school. He worked as an attorney and clerked for N.C. Supreme Court Justice William H. Bobbitt. He served on the staff of Governor Terry Sanford, worked as an administrative officer for the North Carolina General Assembly and assisted constitutional conventions in Maryland and Illinois before being elected Labor Commissioner in 1976. Commissioner of Labor During his tenure, Commissioner Brooks greatly expanded job training through the apprenticeship program. He implemented annual inspections of all migrant labor camps and chicken processing plants. He adopted a blood-borne pathogens standard‚Äîthe first in the south‚Äîand regulations designed to curb abuses in the temporary employment agency industry. He expanded the Wage and Hour enforcement staff so that there could be prompt response to wage and hour complaints. He insisted that all amusement rides be inspected every time they were reassembled. Brooks also advocated for the protection of workers' benefits and for the state minimum wage to be tied to the federal minimum wage. His tenure included the 1991 fire at a food-processing plant in Hamlet that killed 25 workers. This food (not chicken) processing plant was not registered with the North Carolina Secretary of State's office, as required by law, and thus was not on any state inspection list. Moreover, there had been no complaint about the plant from anyone working there, so the N. C. Department of Labor had no way of knowing that the plant even existed. Brooks fined the plant $808,150, which was the largest such penalty in state history. The major cause of death in the accident was the locked exterior doors which was not covered by an OSHA standard at the time, but by a standard administered by the N. C. Department of Insurance. After the 1991 fire and before the 1992 election, Commissioner Brooks adopted the North Carolina Building Code as an OSHA standard, which would have allowed the citation of locked exterior doors. Nonetheless, despite these facts and their being made public, the Labor Department and Commissioner Brooks were made scapegoats for the event, and his efforts were criticized as insufficient. Brooks lost the 1992 Democratic primary for Commissioner of Labor to Harry Payne. After Payne won the General Election, he rescinded the new standard allowing citation for locked exterior doors. 2008 election In 2008, at age 71, Brooks filed as a Democrat to run for Commissioner of Labor again. Brooks placed second in the May 2008 primary, but because no candidate garnered more than 40 percent of the vote, he was allowed to call for a runoff on June 24, with first-place finisher Mary Fant Donnan.News & Observer: No recount in Labor race On the runoff election day, Brooks lost to Donnan, 68%-32%.Romoser, James.

He‚Äôs remained active during that period as an attorney with the N.C. Industrial Commission.

Brooks counters that changes in the state‚Äôs workforce, away from hazardous occupations, also have contributed to progress in the safety arena. He says that with more vigorous enforcement, the state can do even better. North Carolina workers need a determined champion, and Brooks shapes up as a credible alternative to someone who tends to view workplace regulation from an employer‚Äôs perspective.\\"News & Observer endorsements for Council of State References *John Brooks for Labor Commissioner campaign website *Asheville Citizen-Times (March 1, 2008) *New York Times: North Carolina Plant Is Fined $808,150 in Fatal Fire (December 31, 1991) *News & Observer profile North Carolina Commissioners of Labor 1937 births Living people North Carolina Democrats North Carolina lawyers People from Greenville, North Carolina ","title":"John C.

In 1935 the consulate was upgraded to an embassy. From 1951 to 1992, Ethiopia had an embassy in Athens but was forced to close it due to economic reasons. Although the two countries signed trade agreements in 1933, 1955, and 1959, the volume of trade between them remains very low. The Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs, Theodoros Pangalos, made a formal visit to Ethiopia in 1998. The nationalization of properties owned by Greek nationals in Ethiopia during the Derg regime is a factor in the relationship between the two countries.\\"Bilateral relations\\" , Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (accessed 28 July 2009) Diplomatic missions * Ethiopia is accredited to Greece from its embassy in Rome, Italy. * Greece has an embassy in Addis Ababa.

Greece has an embassy in Nairobi and an Honorary Consulate in Mombasa. Kenya is represented in Greece through its embassy in Rome, Italy. PKK leader Abdullah √ñcalan used this Cypriot passport to enter Kenya where he was taken in and protected by the Greek embassy.  Treaties  Greece and Kenya have the following bilateral treaties: The present framework of treaties consists of the following agreements: * Negotiation Protocol between the Foreign Ministries (Nairobi 16.11.1998) * Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (16.11.1998) * Agreement on Legal Aid for Civil and Commercial Affairs (jointly with England, London, 27.2.1936). Law 730/1937. (Government Gazette. 227 /1937). (Through a joint Agreement between Greece and Kenya, dated 16.10.1967 the agreement in force is extended pending a new agreement) * Extradition Agreement (jointly with England). (Athens, 11/24.9.1910). Government Gazette. 41 /1912 (through a Joint Agreement dated 16.10.1967 between Greece and Kenya extended pending a new agreement). A Tourist Agreement between Greece and Kenya agreed upon in 2003 is also pending signature.  Political and economic relations  In November 1998, the Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos visited Kenya. In the 1999 Ocalan affair the Greek consul in Kenya, George Costoulas, harbored PKK leader Abdullah √ñcalan. Ocalan moved from Syria to Italy to Russia to Greece and finally the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on February 2, 1999. Turkish commandos captured Ocalan with the aid of Kenyan security forces. Following the arrest the Kenya government shuffled its Cabinet over the public outcry over its \\"murky role\\" in the affair. Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae resigned rather than accept a demotion to head the Ministry of Industrial Development. Frank Kwinga, who headed the Immigration portfolio, and Duncan Wachira, who was the Police Commissioner, were both dismissed from their positions. Noah Katanangala, the Minister of Land Settlement, was also moved to another post in the government. Three Greek officials were removed from office over the affair. In the first half of 2003 Greece held the Presidency of the European Union and was subsequently elected as a non- permanent member of the UN Security Council. This created a favourable framework for promoting Greece's relations with Africa, especially Kenya, which plays an active role in Central Africa, as seen in her intervention within the framework of IGAD, on the issue of Southern Sudan. The Athens Chamber of Trade and Industry undertook an exploratory visit in 2001 to identify areas for promoting trade relations with Kenya, especially in the foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics sectors. It is expected that the negotiations between the European Union and the ACP countries to establish a new trade regime by the end of 2007 will contribute substantially to the further development of trade with Kenya. The flow of Greek tourists to Kenya has increased over the last few years, especially in the form of package holidays.

The traffickers are reportedly organized crime syndicates, parents, relatives, friends, intimate partners, and neighbors. Despite human trafficking being a crime in Cambodia, the country has a significant child sex tourism problem; some children are sold by their parents, while others are lured by what they think are legitimate job offers like waitressing, but then are forced into prostitution. Children are often held captive, beaten, and starved to force them into prostitution. The Cambodian government was placed in the Tier 2 Watch List in the 2007 U.S. Department of State‚Äôs Trafficking in Persons Report for not fully complying with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act's minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but making significant efforts to do so. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \\"Tier 2\\" in 2017. Survey A UNICEF survey concluded that 35% of Cambodia's 15,000 prostitutes are children under the age of 16. Almost all of Cambodian brothels are Vietnamese-owned, with most of its prostitutes being of Vietnamese descent and captured sex slaves being of other ethnic groups. Men are trafficked for forced labor in the agriculture, fishing, and construction industries. Women are trafficked for sexual exploitation and forced labor in factories or as domestic servants. Children are trafficked for sexual exploitation and forced labor in organized begging rings, soliciting, and street vending. Common destinations for trafficking victims are Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville. Conditions Pimps are reported to imprison young children who are virgins. These children would not be placed to work until they had been presented to a series of bidders, such as high-ranking military officers, politicians, businessmen, and foreign tourists. Young girls working in brothels are in effect, sex slaves; they receive no money, only food, and armed guards stop them from running away. Children are often held captive, beaten, and starved to force them into prostitution. Cases In 1995, a 15-year-old child that was trafficked into prostitution in a brothel in the Svay Por district of Battambang was beaten to death. =Child sex trafficking= Children as young as 3 are being sold as slaves for sex. By some estimates, hundreds of thousands of children are bought, sold, or kidnapped around the world each year and then forced to have sex. ECPAT Cambodia reports that as many as one third of the trafficking victims in prostitution are children.CCPCR =Foreign child molesters= The MOI reported the arrest of 31 foreign child molesters in Cambodia in 2009. Laws A law was passed in January 1997 to curb trafficking in women, with fines of up to $12,000 and prison sentences of up to 20 years for pimps and brothel owners. In 2008, the Government introduced the Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation, which criminalizes all forms of trafficking. However, the country remained a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children trafficked for sexual exploitation and labor. Children were trafficked domestically for sexual exploitation. Cambodia is party to several international covenants prohibiting the trafficking of persons and the exploitation of women and children. Cambodia has continued to assist U.S. law enforcement authorities in the transfer to U.S. custody of Americans who have sexually exploited children in Cambodia. =Anti-Human Trafficking Day= December 12 is observed as National Anti-Human Trafficking Day in Cambodia. Non-governmental organizations On the ground in Cambodia, a number of non- governmental organizations and non-profit organizations are working to combat human trafficking. These include AFESIP, the Somaly Mam Foundation, Hagar International, ECPAT, and Agape International Missions. There are also other development partners that work together to fight against human trafficking.

She has maintained a deep relationship with Haiti, reporting the 2010 earthquake from a feminist angle, especially noting the impact of the disaster on the lives of teenage girls. She has also contributed to humanitarian projects in East Africa, as well as conducting extensive research into HIV/AIDS and its treatment worldwide. Family and Career D'Adesky's father was born in Haiti, where the family's roots go back far; spending her childhood summers and still has extended family living there. D'Adesky earned a master's degree in Journalism from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1982 and a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in New York City in 1979. As a journalist, d'Adesky has been a foreign correspondent in Haiti working as a stringer for The San Francisco Examiner and The Village Voice. She wrote about HIV/AIDS for various newspapers, including the New York Native and In These Times, and later, magazines including The Advocate. She was senior editor at Out magazine in the mid-1990s in charge of health coverage, and also wrote investigative features and long-form profiles. In 1998, she launched HIV Plus magazine, where she served as founding editor in chief for two years before the magazine was sold to The Advocate. She then turned to writing a series on global AIDS for the newsletter of the amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. She also wrote about AIDS for magazines such as SEED and The Nation, newspapers such as The San Francisco Examiner, and health agencies such as the World Health Organization. In 2003 she co-produced Pills, Profits, Protest: Chronicle of the Global AIDS Movement, a documentary about global AIDS treatment activism. As an activist, d'Adesky has been active in the peace and women's movements and attended the Seneca Women's Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice, where she protested the presence of nuclear cruise missiles on US soil. She was an early member of ACT UP who participated in the first Wall Street protest, and other famous actions, demanding faster access to life-saving HIV medications, and later, access to HIV drugs for people living in poor countries. She also joined Get Smart, an arts activist group. D'Adesky is one of the six founders of The Lesbian Avengers, which began in New York City in 1992 as \\"a direct action group focused on issues vital to lesbian survival and visibility.\\" In 2003, d'Adesky began humanitarian work in Africa, focusing on the issue of gender-based violence linked to HIV/AIDS and the use of rape in war in East Africa. She launched and served as co-founder and co- executive director of a global initiative WE-ACTx, based in San Francisco and Kigali, that helps Rwandan women affected by HIV/AIDS who are survivors of genocidal rape, and orphans. WE-ACTx has provided free, comprehensive care to thousands of HIV-positive Rwandan women and children, and is today an all- Rwandan run program operating two clinics in Kigali. D'Adesky stepped down as co-Executive Director in 2008 to become a board member. In 2010, d'Adesky flew to Haiti in the immediate aftermath of the January 10th earthquake, where she has longtime family roots. She began reporting for World Pulse and the Global Post, and launched a blog on the post-quake humanitarian response, Haiti Vox. She also founded a feminist coalition with Haitian and diaspora women activists, PotoFanm+Fi (Women and Girls Pillar, in Haitian Creole), to promote the role, needs and voice of Haitian women in the rebuilding effort. In 2011, she launched the offshoot Haiti-based group, PotoFi (Girls Pillar) and worked to document the gender dimensions of the earthquake and its impact on adolescent girls. She released a report in 2011 with PotoFi showing the teenage Haitian girls bore a disproportionate brunt of the disaster, evidenced by a tide of unplanned, early pregnancies linked to sexual violence, and a survival-based entry into prostitution, and displacement. In 2010, she published a comprehensive review of Haiti's cross-sectorial progress fighting gender violence and rape in a book, Beyond Shock: Charting the Landscape of Sexual Violence in Post-Quake Haiti, published by the UC Santa Barbara Center for Black Studies Research. From 2013 to 2015, d'Adesky served as the Global Coordinator for Haiti for the V-Day \\"One Billion Rising\\" (OBR) worldwide campaign against sexual violence. She helped organise a major Mardi Gras Carnaval float on gender justice in 2014 and led a grassroots effort to reduce the risk of rape and assaults during this annual event, to great success. With PotoFi, she also organised forums across Haiti on sexual violence and adolescents. In 2014, she organised a historic French/Haitian Creole production of The Vagina Monologues at Haiti's Parliament in 2014, and a year later, a major outdoor feminist event that included a free production of the play in the capital that drew a crowd of 6,000 people. D'Adesky continues to advocate and report on Haiti, sexual violence and human rights issues, with a fresh focus on LGBT and women's asylum /refugee issues for various periodicals, including PRIDE magazine. She began tracking the resurgence of the far-Right in Europe for a recently completed 90s AIDS activist memoir.

Diplomatic relations  Greece and Japan established diplomatic relations in 1899. There has been a Greek Embassy in Tokyo since 1960, and a Japanese Embassy in Athens since the same year, when it was decided to upgrade the Japanese Consulate which had opened in 1922 and reopened in 1956. The consulate closed during World War II (1935‚Äì45). Since then the two countries have enjoyed good relations in all fields, and cooperate closely.  Treaty framework  Relations between the two countries were established with the signing of the Agreement on friendship, trade and navigation. The following bilateral agreements have also been concluded: 1956: Agreement on abolition of visas for non-diplomatic passports. 1973: Aviation Agreement. 1981: Education agreement. 2002: Action plan for the promotion of Greek-Japanese relations.  Political relations  As far as political cooperation goes, the two countries are working closely together to upgrade their bilateral relations as well as in their response to international crises and in dealing with current issues of international interest. They also cooperate closely and provide reciprocal support in matters of direct national interest, and mutually support each other's candidacies for positions in international organizations. In 1919, Greece supported Japanese racial equality proposal against Great Powers. In the elections for seats on the UN Security Council the two countries supported each other's candidacy for positions as non-permanent members of the Council (2005‚Äì2006), while during their term on the Council their cooperation in international affairs has become even closer. The political relations between Greece and Japan are reflected in frequent high-level visits, mainly ministerial visits in the framework of international conferences. In terms of bilateral visits, the then Prime Minister of Greece, Konstantinos Simitis, visited Japan between 3‚Äì5 March 2002, accompanied by a delegation of businessmen and journalists, while the Speaker of the Greek Parliament, Mrs. Anna Psarouda-Benaki, visited Tokyo from 29 May to 3 June 2005. In 1-3.05.03 the Japanese Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, visited Greece for the EU- Japan summit during the Greek Presidency of the EU. On that occasion he held a bilateral meeting with the then Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Simitis. The Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis paid a working visit to Japan (10-13.11.2005). The President of the Japanese Parliament, Y≈çhei K≈çno, visited Greece in 9‚Äì10 January 2005. Economic and trading relations Although there is a substantial volume of trade between the two countries, the balance is disproportionately in Japan's favour, at a ratio of about 1:10. This is because most Japanese exports to Greece are hi-tech and industrial products, while Greek exports are agricultural produce, marble, etc. However, recent years have seen a steady increase in Greek exports, which is indicative of the potential and marked competitiveness of Greek businesses on the Japanese market. One area in which Greece is particularly dynamic is shipping, with a steadily rising volume of orders and ships being constructed in Japanese yards. It is estimated that these orders are worth 2 billion dollars each year. Greece is one of the countries where Japanese investment remains low, but Japanese companies have expressed keen interest in cooperation with Greek businesses in the investment sector, while annual exchange visits of business delegations from each side are doing much to promote trade and investment through better understanding of the specific features of the two markets. Within this context Greece had its own pavilion at the 2005 international trade fair in Aichi, Japan. The number of tourists visiting Greece from Japan has been rising steadily in recent years. About 80,000 Japanese tourists visit the country each year. Even larger numbers are expected in the future, following the huge publicity which Greece enjoyed during the Olympic Year 2004. In 2000 the Greek-Japanese Chamber of Commerce was established as a non- profit organization, as the successful progress of the Association of Hellenic Japanese Business Co-operation. The Greek-Japanese Chamber is aiming towards promoting mutual economic, commercial and business relations between Greece and Japan.  Cultural relations  In 1999 celebratory cultural events were organized on both sides to mark the centenary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Greece and Japan. Over recent years in particular there has been intense cultural exchange. Within the context of the Cultural Months envisaged in the Greece-Japan Action Plan in the run-up to the 2004 Olympics, numerous cultural events were organized in both countries, all highly successful, well-attended and extensively covered by the media. To mention a few examples: In Japan: * Performances in Japan of the ancient Greek tragedy Antigone, by the National Theatre (11-16.03.03). * An archaeological exhibition on the subject of Alexander the Great: Cultural Contacts between East and West. From Greece to Japan, Tokyo: 05.08 05.10.03, Kobe: 18.10-21.12.03. * Performances of traditional Greek dances from all over Greece by a 30-member troupe from the Likiou ton Ellinidon, Tokyo 15.05.04 and Kobe 17.05.04. In Greece: * Performances of the ancient tragedy Oedipus Rex, by Y. Ninagawa, Herod Atticus Theatre, 1-3.7.04 * Noh Theatre performance: Sanbasou - Dai-Hannya (noh) - The Sutra of Great Wisdom, directed by Rokuro Gensho Umewaka, Herod Atticus Theatre, 16.06.10 * Noh theatre performance: \\"Nekyia\\", a story from Book 11 of Homer‚Äôs The Odyssey, directed by Michael Marmarinos and Rokuro Gensho Umewaka, Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus, 24-25.07.2015, supported by Arts Council Tokyo (Tokyo Metropolitan Foundation for History and Culture) * Greek-oriented Cultural agencies: There are a number of Greek oriented cultural organizations in Japan, set up at the initiative of Japanese academics in the field of Greek studies, in order to promote Greek culture, history and the learning of the Greek language. Some of the most important of these are The Classical Society of Japan, The Aegean Society of Japan, and The Japan Greece Society. The year 2009 marked the 110th anniversary of friendship between the countries. From March to the end of the year, both countries scheduled extensive cultural exhibits celebrating the occasion. =Serbia= Due to Greece's good relations to Serbia, Japan has used Greece as a bridge to improve relationship with Serbia.  Greek community in Japan  There is a Greek community of roughly 300 people living in Japan. The majority of them are employed by multinational companies, although some are businesspeople who have settled there on a permanent basis.

They merged folk, rock, R&B; and blues. They are influenced heavily from the 50s classic pop and rock, such as Nolan Strong and the Diablos, the Crows, Dion and the Belmonts, the Mystics and the Passions. History Andrea \\"Bunky\\" Skinner and Allan \\"Jake\\" Jacobs (who later formed Jake and The Family Jewels, a band with Jerry Burnham, Michael Epstein, Dan Mansolino), met in 1962 at the School of Visual Arts in New York and performed in the Greenwich Village folk circuit. The duo appeared at The Bitter End on the bill with Joni Mitchell and David Steinberg, and were written about in Rolling Stone.Rolling Stone Magazine No. 31 April 19, 1969, w/ Sun Ra on cover In 1965, Jacobs joined the folk-rock band The Magicians, with Garry Bonner, Alan Gordon, and John Townley. The band gained a following in New York, and took over as the house band from the Lovin' Spoonful at the Night Owl Cafe. The Magicians disbanded in 1967, and Jacobs and Skinner signed with Mercury Records, releasing their 1968 debut album, Bunky & Jake. It was followed a year later by L.A.M.F. (Mercury SR61199). All songs on the first album were written by Skinner and/or Jacobs. The second album, in addition to original songs, included two by Chuck Berry, one by Don & Dewey, and a Jacobs- Skinner arrangement of \\"I Am the Light,\\" by the Reverend Gary Davis. The band included Skinner (vocals and guitar); Jacobs (guitar and vocals); Douglas Haywood Rauch (bass); and Micheal Rosa (drums). Other musicians appearing were Mike Matthews, Charlie Chin, Felix Pappalardi, Buzzy Linhart, Perry Robinson, Ray Barretto, Ernie Hayes, and Chuck Rainey. The duo released a children's album Oo-Wee Little Children, on their own B&J; Music label (cassette, 1993 and CD, 2004.) Skinner died on Sunday, March 20, 2011 after a brief illness. , Jacobs lives in Manhattan. In October 2012, Jacobs released a new collection of songs on a 16-song CD entitled A Lick and a Promise by Jake and the Rest of the Jewels. Discography * Bunky & Jake (1968) * L.A.M.F.

Samuelson and William D. Nordhaus, 2004. Economics, McGraw-Hill, ch. 2, \\"Trade, Specialization, and Division of Labor\\" section. Market incentives, such as reflected in prices of outputs and inputs, are theorized to attract factors of production, including labor, into activities according to comparative advantage, that is, for which they each have a low opportunity cost. The factor owners then use their increased income from such specialization to buy more-valued goods of which they would otherwise be high-cost producers, hence their gains from trade. The concept may be applied to an entire economy for the alternatives of autarky (no trade) or trade. A measure of total gains from trade is the sum of consumer surplus and producer profits or, more roughly, the increased output from specialization in production with resulting trade.Paul A.

Rather, a large economy might be able to set taxes and subsidies to its benefit at the expense of other economies. Later results of Kemp and others showed that in an Arrow-Debreu world with a system of lump-sum compensatory mechanisms, corresponding to a customs union for a given subset set of countries (described by free trade among a group of economies and a common set of tariffs), there is a common set of world' tariffs such that no country would be worse off than in the smaller customs union. The suggestion is that if a customs union has advantages for an economy, there is a worldwide customs union that is at least as good for each country in the world.‚Ä¢ Murray C.

Measurement Classical economists maintain that there are two methods to measure the gains from trade: 1) international trade increases national income which helps us to get low priced imports; 2) gains are measured in terms of trade. To measure the gains from the trade, comparison of a country's cost of production with a foreign country's cost of production for the same product is required. However, it is very difficult to acquire the knowledge of cost of production and cost of imports in a domestic country. Therefore, terms of trade method is preferable to measure the gains from trade. Factors affecting gains  There are several factors which determine the gains from international trade: # Differences in cost ratio: The gains from international trade depends upon the cost ratios of differences in comparative cost ratios in the two trading countries. The smaller the difference between exchange rate and cost of production the smaller the gains from trade and vice versa. # Demand and supply: If a country has elastic demand and supply gains the gains from trade are higher than if demand and supply are inelastic. # Factor availability: International trade is based on the specialization and a country specializes depending upon the availability of factors of production. It will increase the domestic cost ratios and thereby the gains from trade. # Size of country: If a country is small in size it is relatively easy for them to specialize in the production of one commodity and export the surplus production to a large country and can get more gains from international trade. Whereas if a country is large in size then they have to specialize in more than one good because the excess production of only one commodity can not be exported fully to a small sized country as the demand for good will reduce very frequently. So the smaller the size of the country, the larger the gain from trade. # Terms of Trade: Gains from trade will depend upon the terms of trade. If the cost ratio and terms of trade are closer to each other more will be the gains from trade of the participating countries. # Productive Efficiency: An increase in the productive efficiency of a country also determines its gains from trade as it lowers the cost of production and price of the goods. As a result, the country importing gains by importing cheap goods. Static and dynamic gains from trade The gains from trade can be clad into static and dynamic gains from trades. Static Gains means the increase in social welfare as a result of maximized national output due to optimum utilization of country's factor endowments or resources. Dynamic gains from trade, are those benefits which accelerate economic growth of the participating countries. Static gains are the result of the operation of the theory of comparative cost in the field of foreign trade. On this principle countries make the optimum use of their available resources so that their national output is greater which also raises the level of social welfare in the country. When there is an introduction of foreign trade in the economy the result is called the static gains from trade. Dynamic gains from trade relate to economic development of the economy. Specialization of the country for the production of best suited commodities which result in a large volume of quality production which promotes growth. Thus the extension of domestic market to foreign market will accelerate economic growth.

The gentil√© is Navarre. Since 2014, the town has been in the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France. Etymology The name Navarrenx comes from sponda Navarrensi, meaning the \\"bedstead of Navarre\\" or \\"House of the Navarreses\\". According to linguist Michel Grosclaude it may have meant the edge of the Navarre. There may be kinship between the Basque radical Navarre and Navarrenx, but Basque philologists hesitate to link the several etymologies. The first written mention of the name of the city lies in a charter of 1078. Navarrenx (Navarrensis) is mentioned five times. History The earliest history of the site dates to the first century. Navarrenx is reported in a cartulary of the eleventh century under the name of Sponda-Navarrensis. There was a long- standing agreement between Centulle V, Viscount of B√©arn, and Oloron and his vassal Raymond-William, Viscount of Soule. They came to Navarrenx to repair the harm done to the B√©arnais by the Souletins. It may make reason and justice on oath, either by paying a fine or by ordeal. In this case, the text says that the duel happened, not on the bank of the Gave the side of the Soule, but the shore-side Navarrenx (Belluno Fiet Quod non in ripa Soulensi, sed in Sponda Navarrensis). The place is still known today as the camp batalha. In 1188, Gaston VI called for a charter of a \\"Bridge of Navarrenx\\" a stone bridge, and the establishment of a market, and a perimeter \\"sauvet√©\\" (a sauvet√© is in the south of France in the Middle Ages, an area of extraterritoriality, protected by the Catholic Church and in which man's law no longer applies. This space of freedom, in the scope of which he was forbidden to pursue the fugitives, was marked by boundaries, with \\"hospitau\\" and chapel. The bridge was finally built in 1289. It facilitates access to Pyrenean passes and Navarra, particularly for pilgrims on the Way of Saint Jacques de Compostela. Indeed, the village is an important step on the road to Puy crossroads leading to the Somport pass to the east and to the west of Roncesvalles. The Viscount of B√©arn built a magnificent castle Casterasse (\\"fortress\\") on the hill to the west, at the confluence of the Gave d‚ÄôOloron and L‚ÄôArroder Rivers. In 1523, the Castilians led by Philibert of Chalon, Prince of Orange, seized the city and destroyed the Casterasse. Henry II of Albret, the king of Navarre, decided to reinforce defences on the right bank of the mountain stream of Oloron. From 1538 to 1546, fortification works were carried out under the direction of B√©arn master builders Fran√ßois Girard and Arnaud de Mirassor, as per the design of Italian architectural engineer Fabricio Siciliano. Navarrenx was thus transformed into a modern fortified town \\"Italian-style\\", based on the citadel of Lucca in Tuscany. Later, a powder magazine would be built that would store up to of gunpowder: a square- shaped construction little more than long, it was originally surrounded by a wall, part of which was visible aboveground. While this wall has since disappeared, the thickness of this wall () and the lowness of the building () prevented it from receiving direct hits from enemy forces. The fortifications were tried and tested during religious wars under the reign of Jeanne of Albret, when the garrison under the command of the Baron of Arros successfully resisted a three-month siege in 1568. The town was re-equipped in the 18th century, in particular with the Saint-Antoine gate built by engineer De Salmon on the ruins of an old church. Facing Spain, the gate owed its name to a chapel that welcomed pilgrims and was destroyed during the construction of the ramparts. With three massive arcades, the town was accessed via a drawbridge, the passage of the chains of which can still be seen today. In the 19th century, work on road and rail infrastructure led to the destruction of the old Saint-Germain gate which faced France. Over the centuries, the fortified wall of Navarrenx has retained its main features. It outlines a reinforced firing range at each of its five corners with a bastion. Two of the five are fitted with anti-mine galleries, while a glacis and ground structures reinforce the town to the east, ahead of the moat. Several barracks have been built inside the walls to house the garrison, one of which nowadays is used as the tourist information office. From the top of the ramparts (for example, from the crenellation platform overhanging the Saint-Antoine gate), there is a pleasant view of the Pyrenees and, below, the arches of the bridge of Navarrenx (13th century). Visits There is free access to the 1818-metre perimeter of the town. The walls of the city contain bilingual (French- English) descriptive plaques that trace the history of each structure.

It is a vin de liqueur fortified with armagnac, the local brandy. It has had Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e status since 1990. Elsewhere in France analogous drinks are made (Pineau des Charentes in the Cognac zone, Macvin in Jura; there is also Pommeau, similarly made by blending apple juice and apple brandy). History Floc de Gascogne is produced according to a recipe that has been in use in the French region of Gascony since the 16th century. The name \\"Floc de Gascogne\\" was coined by Henri Lamor, a winemaker from Cravenc√®res, in 1954. The word \\"floc\\" comes from the Occitan language and means bouquet of flowers.
