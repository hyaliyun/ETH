He is a co-founder and executive vice chairman of Alibaba Group. Born in Taiwan and educated in the U.S., he is a naturalized citizen of Canada. He owns the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and has interests in several other professional sports franchises. Early life, family, and education Joseph Tsai was born in Taipei, Taiwan to Dr. Paul C. Tsai (, d. 4 May 2013), a second-generation lawyer, and his wife Ruby. He has three younger siblings, Eva, Vivian, and Benjamin.https://www.mayo.edu/pmts/mc2300-mc2399/mc2386-3101.pdf The Tsai family escaped to Taiwan as part of the Kuomintang exodus after the Chinese Communist Party took over control of mainland China in 1949. At age 13, Tsai was sent to the U.S. to attend the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, where he played both lacrosse and football (inside linebacker) and was a member of the Cleve House. Tsai enrolled in his father's alma mater, Yale University. He played in the Yale varsity lacrosse team for four years, and has been a consistent supporter of the team. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics and East Asian studies from Yale College in 1986. In 1990, he earned a J.D. from Yale Law School, where he was articles editor of the Yale Law & Policy Review. Career Tsai became a tax associate at the white-shoe law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell after graduation and was admitted as an attorney to the New York bar on 6 May 1991.https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/attorney/AttorneyDetails?attorneyId=XIraymWJ8MxZLv7U0usnrg After three years at the law firm, he switched to private equity and joined Rosecliff, Inc., a small management buyout firm based in New York, as vice president and general counsel. He left for Hong Kong in 1995 to join Investor AB, where he was responsible for its Asian private equity investments. It was in this role that he first met Jack Ma in 1999 in Hangzhou after being introduced by a friend who was trying to sell his own company to Ma. Tsai was impressed with Ma's idea to create an international import and export marketplace, as well as his charismatic personality, but it was Ma's followers and their energy and enthusiasm that ultimately convinced Tsai. Later that year he quit the $700,000-a-year job at Investor AB and offered to join Ma as a member of the founding team for almost nothing. At the time each of Alibaba's 18 co-founders‚Äîof which Tsai was the only Western-educated member‚Äîaccepted a salary of only $600 a year. He served as chief operating officer, chief financial officer, and founding board member. He single- handedly established Alibaba's financial and legal structure, since no other member of the team had any experience in venture capital or law. In May 2013, he became Alibaba's executive vice chairman. He has become the second-largest individual shareholder of Alibaba after Ma. Sports ownership In September 2019, Tsai became the owner of the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA and chairman of Barclays Center. He initially invested in the NBA team in October 2017, purchasing a 49% stake in the Nets from Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov in a deal that valued the team at $2.3 billion, with the option to buy the remaining stake of the team no later than 2021. Tsai exercised that option in August 2019, and at the same time, bought the Nets' arena from Prokhorov for nearly $1 billion in a separate deal. Tsai's ownership in the Nets includes the Long Island Nets of the NBA G League and the Nets Gaming Crew of the NBA 2K League. In January 2019, Tsai headed a group that bought the WNBA's New York Liberty from The Madison Square Garden Company. He owns the San Diego Seals, a professional box lacrosse team in the National Lacrosse League (NLL). He is also chairman of J Tsai Sports. Through that company, he has investments in the upstart field lacrosse league, the Premier Lacrosse League and several sports media and technology companies based in North America and Asia. Tsai made his investment in the Premier Lacrosse League in February 2019, along with The Chernin Group and The Raine Group, helping fund the new lacrosse league founded by lacrosse player Paul Rabil and his brother Mike Rabil. In March 2018 Tsai joined a Michael Rubin-led group to buy the Carolina Panthers. Tsai is also an investor in Major League Soccer franchise Los Angeles FC. Personal life Tsai holds Canadian and Hong Kong passports. He is married to Clara Ming-Hua Wu, a granddaughter of , the first elected mayor of Taipei City. Clara spent her childhood in Lawrence, Kansas and graduated from Lawrence High School. Clara also graduated from Stanford University, where she studied international relations, and has an MBA degree from Harvard Business School. She is an advisor for Taobao. Tsai and Wu have three children. They lived in Hong Kong for over a decade and now live in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, while he still spends much of his time in Hong Kong for business. His wife Clara is a member of The Bishop's School board of trustees. Politics On 7 October 2019, Tsai weighed in after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, posted a tweet supporting protesters in Hong Kong. In an open letter to all NBA fans on his Facebook page, Tsai explained, with historical reference to foreign invasions of China, why Morey's tweet triggered strong negative sentiment in China. Tsai said ‚ÄúI am going into all of this, because a student of history will understand that the Chinese psyche has heavy baggage when it comes to any threat, foreign or domestic, to carve up Chinese territories. When the topic of any separatist movement comes up, Chinese people feel a strong sense of shame and anger because of this history of foreign occupation.‚Äù In his open letter, Tsai referred to Hong Kong protesters as part of a \\"separatist movement.\\" He wrote: \\"The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country‚Äôs sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable.‚Äù Philanthropy In March 2016, Tsai donated $30 million to his alma mater, Yale Law School, in honor of his father to support the continuing work of the Law School's China Center and renamed it Paul Tsai China Center. In December 2016, Yale announced a university-wide project center for innovative thinking with a mission to inspire students from diverse backgrounds and disciplines to seek innovative ways to solve real-world problems. Six months later, in May 2017, Tsai and his wife, through the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation, made another donation to Yale for the construction, launch, and programs of the center and named it Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking. One month later, in June 2017, Tsai and his wife, again through the Joe & Clara Tsai Foundation, made a donation to his high school, the Lawrenceville School, which was the single largest gift the school ever received. Tsai is a member of Lawrenceville's board of trustees. In late March and early April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tsai and his wife, Clara Wu Tsai donated 2.6 million masks, 170,000 goggles and 2000 ventilators to New York. On 20 April 2020, they donated $1.6 million of medical supplies to hospitals in San Diego. In August 2020, Tsai and his wife donated $50 million to social justice and economic equality initiatives to support BIPOC causes.  Awards  In 2017, Tsai received the George H.W. Bush ‚Äò48 Lifetime of Leadership Award from Yale University. The award honors alumni athletes who, in their lives after Yale, have made significant leadership contributions in their worlds of governance, commerce, science and technology, education, public service, and the arts and media.

It was equipped with one M1 automatic 37 millimeter (1.5 in) gun and two water-cooled .50 caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning heavy machine guns. Based on the M3 half-track chassis, it was produced by the White Motor Company and Autocar between July 1942 and February 1944, and served alongside the M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage. The M15 evolved from the T28 project, an outgrowth of a 37 millimeter (1.5 in) gun mounted on an M2 half-track. Initially designated as the T28E1 Combination Gun Motor Carriage (CGMC), it was accepted into service in 1943 as the M15. While conceived as an anti-aircraft weapon, its 37 mm gun was often used as an infantry support weapon during the later stages of World War II. The M15A1 was an improved variant with air-cooled machine guns mounted below the 37 mm gun. The M15 \\"Special\\" was an M15 armed with a single Bofors 40 mm gun. During World War II, the vehicle served the U.S. Army throughout the Mediterranean, European, and Pacific theaters of operations. In the Korean War, the M15 served alongside the M16 providing infantry support. Specifications The M15 was based on the M3 half-track chassis, adding a coaxially mounted armament of a fully automatic M1 gun and two superior-placed .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns. Manned by a crew of seven,Ness (2002), p. 206. it was long, wide, and high, and had a wheelbase of .Berndt (1993), p. 152. The vehicle's armor was up to 12 mm thick, and the vehicle weighed . The suspension was leaf spring on the front axle and vertical volute spring for the tracks. A 386-cubic inch (6.330 cc) White 160AX, 128-horsepower (95 kW), 6-cylinder gasoline engine gave the M15 a power-to-weight ratio of 15.8 horsepower per ton and a maximum road speed of .Hunnicutt (2001), p. 221.Berndt (1994), p. 34.Hogg & Weeks (1980), p. 94. Its fuel tank provided a range of . Development alt=A side view of the M15 The M15 design developed from the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps' T1A2 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage (MGMC) project, which added a 37-mm gun to an M2 half-track car. It was designated the T28 and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The tests were deemed unsuccessful due to heavy recoil, and the project was canceled in 1942.Green & Green (2000), p. 151.Gander (2013), p. 234. T28E1 A United States Army Armored Force requirement for a mobile anti-aircraft gun to support the coming North African Campaign resulted in the T28 project being revived soon after its cancellation. The new vehicles used the larger M3 half- track chassis and an M2E1 sight for target spotting,Hunnicutt (2001), p. 131.Popular Mechanics (1943), p. 7. receiving the designation T28E1 Combination Gun Motor Carriage (CGMC).Zaloga (1994), p. 38. A total of eighty T28E1s were produced from July to August 1942 by White, all of which had a mount lacking protection for the gun combination and crew. After this initial run the vehicle gained an armored mount and went into production as the M15 CGMC. Some of the T28E1s still in service had their 37 mm guns removed and were converted into M3A1 half-tracks.Rottman (2012), p. 30. M15, M15A1, M15 \\"Special\\" alt=A half-track shooting at several aircraft after Normandy. The M15 was equipped with the M42 armored weapon mount, with two water-cooled coaxial M2 Browning machine guns above a 37 mm gun. A total of 680 M15s were produced in 1943 by White and Autocar before the considerable stress this mount placed on the M3 chassis resulted in its replacement with the M54 mount. The new mount reversed weapon placement, used simpler and lighter air-cooled M2 Brownings, and added a M6 sighting system.Hunter (1951), p. 220 The resulting combination of the M54 mount with the M3A1 half-track chassis was designated the M15A1 CGMC.Green & Green (2000), p. 152. A total of 1,052 were produced in 1943, and a further 600 in 1944.Berndt (1994), p. 33. 100 M15s were shipped to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease policy. Both the M42 mount and M15 CGMC were classified as obsolete in August 1946. The M15 \\"Special\\" was the unofficial name for an M15 (and probably other CGMCs) adapted in depots in Australia to carry only a single Bofors 40 mm gun. To enhance ground support firepower during the Korean War, depots in Japan were searched for vehicles that could be refurbished for possible combat use. A shortage of 37 mm ammunition and relative abundance of 40 mm ammunition resulted in conversion of some M15s into \\"T19s\\", later officially designated model M34.Hunnicutt (2001), p. 195. Service history M16 MGMC operated alongside the M15A1 in World War II and Korea, here in action during the later conflict.|alt=A M16 on a ridge during the Korean War. The M15 was first used during Operation Torch, the November 1942 Anglo-American invasion of North Africa. Tracer ammunition from the machine guns was used to bring the main gun onto the target when engaging enemy aircraft. T28E1 crews shot down more than a hundred aircraft during Operation Torch, the Battle of Kasserine Pass, and the Allied Invasion of Sicily, shooting down thirty-nine at Kasserine alone.Zaloga (1994), p. 38. One T28E1 was captured at Kasserine by the Germans and rebuilt as an equipment and troop carrier to replace vehicles destroyed by Allied aircraft.Zaloga (1994), pp. 42‚Äì43. During the Allied Invasion of Sicily, 78 T28E1s helped provide anti-aircraft fire for the invasion force. They were especially effective against low-flying aircraft, like Stuka dive bombers. T28E1s were used in Italy until the end of the war.Hunnicutt (2001), p. 185. Each US Army armored division was allocated an anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) battalion of four companies, each equipped with eight M15 CGMCs and eight M45 Quadmount-equipped M16 MGMCs. At corps and army level, each AAA battalion was equipped with thirty-two of each vehicle. After first seeing action in the Allied invasion of Italy, the M15 and M15A1 served through the rest of the Italian Campaign, the Allied invasion of Normandy, Operation Dragoon in southern France, and throughout the fighting on the Western Front. They were often used in ground support roles, as Allied air superiority left few German aircraft to engage. The vehicles were also used in the Pacific Theater during the campaign to liberate the Philippines and during the Battle of Okinawa. The M15 \\"Special\\" was used by the 209th AAA Battalion in the Philippines from 1944 to 1945. The M15 and M15A1 served in a ground-support role during the Korean War.Berndt (1994) p. 32.Ness (2002) p. 193.Zaloga (1994), pp. 40‚Äì41. The M34 (instead of the M15A1, which was then classified as \\"limited standard\\") served with several AAA battalions there, including the 76th AAA Battalion and the 140th AAA Battalion. Several M15 \\"Specials\\" managed to avoid being scrapped in the post-war period and were also used, along with those converted in Japan.Doyle (2011), p. 395. After World War II, many M15s were provided to Japan under the Military Aid Program (MAP). At least 20 were sent to Yugoslavia during the Informbiro period.

Plot Forest officer Pratap (Tiger Prabhakar) manages to capture a gang of notorious criminals and saves Onti Salaga (lone tusker), which has almost drowned in a swamp. His bravery is noticed by his superior, a seemingly innocent but shrewd ranger (Vajramuni). A constable whose partners were brutally killed by a few criminals is rescued by Onti Salaga (Ambareesh), a private detective. He also captures those criminals and gives the credit for the constable who gets a promotion. He meets an arrogant young girl (Kushboo) and tames her eventually developing feelings for her. She seeks his help in finding her kidnapped brother. It is revealed that her rich brother (Avinash) is kidnapped and tortured by Chandra Chakravarthy (Jai Jagadish) who, pretending to be a pious bank employee, looted the building and killed the security guard so as to make others believe that he was killed in the brawl. While taking the money to his boss and father, the same old ranger (Vajramuni) he is spotted by the industrialist (Avinash), whom he kidnaps and tortures for his wealth. He also hires a few bodyguards to keep an eye on the man's family. Shankar aka Onti Salaga suspects Chandra Chakravarthy (who has changed his appearance) and starts stalking him. Meanwhile he is recognised by Madhukar, who happens to be a close confidante of Shankar. In order to cover up his crime, Chandra Chakravarthy kills Madhukar and also attempts to murder Shankar. However, he escapes and swears to seek revenge for his friend's death. His investigation leads him to the conclusion that his girlfriend's brother (Avinash) is also in Chandra Chakravarthy's custody. Shankar uses Chakravarthy's estranged wife and son (who believes he was killed in the robbery) to confirm his real identity. Finding this to be a real danger, he kidnaps his son from his wife's house on his father's advice. Meanwhile, Shankar saves his girlfriend's brother with the help of that old constable now an inspector. Having enough of Shankar, the old ranger sends goons to kill him. Although Shankar gets the upper hand, he is defeated and left to die by chaining him in his house, which the goons sets on fire. They also kidnap Shankar's girlfriend, her mother and Chakravarthy's wife so as to kill them. Here, it's revealed that Shankar is forest officer Pratap's son. Pratap, who is a widower, lives with his son. He finds that the gang whom he caught has escaped with the help of the ranger, his superior, who surprisingly happens to be their leader. Pratap gets into a fight with them while they try to smuggle ivory and sandalwood, but gets killed by the ranger. This is witnessed by Shankar, his son. Shankar manages to untie himself in the same way, by which Pratap saved the tusker at the beginning from drowning. Having escaped, he saves the others and kills Chandra Chakravarthy. Before killing the ranger, he reveals that he is the son of forest officer Pratap and had been searching for his father's killer. He then kills the ranger and unites with others.

On the other hand, after the killing, near a mission headquarters, of Chinese soldiers under Japanese command, some 60 Catholics, including a bishop, thought to have been involved were arrested with the intention of subjecting them to court-martial, but after intervention by the French diplomatic representatives were, except for one priest, released on condition that the bishop, who had previously refused to meet the Japanese authorities, be removed from his post. Missionaries were interned, and some were killed. Nicholas Standaert, R.G.

Biography The son of two freedmen, Dennis and Nellie (n√©e Shorter) Pierce, William Joseph Pierce was born in Purcellville, Virginia. His parents were truck farmers, but Billy, an only child, went to college, matriculating first at Storer College and then attending Howard University. Pierce started out as a journalist, eventually moving to Chicago to write for the Chicago Defender, the premier African American newspaper of its time. He also worked for two Washington, D.C.-based newspapers, the Dispatcher and the Washington Eagle. During World War One, he served with the 8th Infantry Regiment of the Illinois National Guard, an all-black unit commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Otis B. Duncan, the highest ranking black officer in the United States Army during the War to End All Wars. As a journalist, Pierce wrote about the arts, but eventually left his typewriter for a life in the theater. Starting in Chicago, he made his bones as a dancer and trombonist in vaudeville and performed as a banjoist in Dr. Diamond Dick's Kickapoo Medicine Show on the Theater Owners Booking Association circuit of black vaudeville theaters, which took him to New York City. In Gotham, he re-entered the newspaper business. It was while soliciting advertising on Broadway, he decided to become a choreographer. He conceived the idea of a dance studio along with Leonard Harper, who soon lost heart. Pierce brought their idea to fruition when he opened a dance studio in one room on the top floor of the Navex building on 46th Street west of Broadway where he doubled as an elevator operator. The Billy Pierce Dance Studio at 223 West 46th Street in New York flourished and became one of the incubators for the cultural flowering know to posterity as the Harlem Renaissance. By 1929, Pierce's studio‚Äîthe \\"largest of its kind\\" according to the Afro American newspaper‚Äîoccupied five rooms in the bottom two floors of the building, for which Pierce paid annually $6,000 in rent (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars). Pierce ran the studio and coached Broadway stars, but did not serve as an instructor for the 27 classes that were given to students in 1929. The Pierce Dance Studio was the professional home of his fellow African American choreographer Buddy Bradley, who devised dance routines for the eccentric dancer Tom Pericola, a white man. Pericola performed the Black Bottom with the Ann Pennington in the musical- comedy revue George White's Scandals of 1926 on Broadway, whereupon it became popular eventually supplanting Charleston on dance floors across America. Along with the Black Bottom and the Charleston, among the specialities of the Billy Pierce Dance Studio were the Black Bottom with Taps, the Eccentric Buck and the Syncopated Buck, the Devil Dance, the Dirty Dig, the Flapper Stomp, the Harlem Hips, the Jungle Stomp, the Stair Dance, and the Zulu Stomp. In the United States, African American choreographers like Pierce and Bradley generally worked uncredited. They also coached and developed routines for white performers, such as Bradley had coached Pericola. Before he became an Oscar-winning character actor, Clifton Webb was a song and dance man on Broadway, appearing in many musicals. He honed his dancing skills at Pierce's studio. Pierce developed the \\"Moaning Low\\" dance routine for \\"Cliff\\" Webb, as he was then known, and Libby Holman for The Little Show in 1931. Along with Benny Rubin, Pierce did the choreography for the 1927 musical Half a Widow, one of the few Broadway shows for which he received credit. He also created \\"The Sugar Foot Strut\\" dance for the smash hit musical Rio Rita (1927) and developed a show-stopping routine for Norma Terris, who played Magnolia in the original 1927 production of Show Boat and its 1932 revival. He also got credit for choreographing the dances in the 1932 musical revue Walk a Little Faster. In 1930, he spent eleven months in Europe, working with directors such as Max Rheinhardt. Personal life Pierce married Nona Stovall in 1927, and they had two children, Billy, Jr. (1928) and Denise (1930). His career was cut short when he died from mastoiditis in 1933 at the age of 42.

Although originally marketed as pentode tubes for use in early television receivers, they found additional uses in audio and radiotelephone equipment. The series shares the EIA 9BF pinout with a number of other miniature pentode tubes of the era. The most successful tube in this series, 12BY7A was introduced by General Electric in June 1955 as a demodulated video signal amplifier for television receivers. Its design specifications called for linear gain along a wide bandwidth (approximately 4 MHz) with low transconductance (13 Millimhos (Millisiemens)) and high sensitivity. This combination of sensitivity, bandwidth and price lead to its popularity in audio amplification systems during the tube era.  Functional Equivalents  Like other vacuum tubes of US and Japanese manufacture, the RETMA tube designation system was used to designate identical tubes across different manufacturers. Any variations from the original electrical design specifications required a change to the tube designation code. As a result, a number of cross-reference resources exist. In some cases, multiple tube designation numbers were marked on the tube itself. 12BY7 12BY7 was an immediate successor to the 12BV7 and provided the same overall amplification values, but had slightly higher screen dissipation and voltage ratings. The tube exhibited slightly lower transconductance ratings (11 mS vs the original specification of 13 mS) as a result of this change. 12BY7A The most popular variant from the original 12BV7 was the 12BY7A. In this case, the A suffix is used to indicate a backwards-compatible revision to the original specification. Specifically, the heater filament had been redesigned to further protect it from the potentially damaging voltage spikes which were known to occur when the tube heater circuits were wired in series rather than parallel. All of the other design specifications, including warmup time, were identical to the 12BY7. 12DQ7 The 12DQ7 was the final backwards compatible update to the 12BV7. It offered higher maximum screen and plate voltages of 330VAC. The transconductance value was further reduced from 11 mS to 10.5 mS. 7733 The 7733 is listed as a premium version of the 12BY7A variant suitable for industrial or instrument service. EL180 This is the European Mullard‚ÄìPhilips tube designation number for the 12BY7A variant. The code breakdown is as follows: *E = Heated Cathode - Heater voltage = 6.3VAC, 6.3VDC Parallel, 12.6VDC Series *L = Type of Device = Power tetrode, beam tetrode or power pentode *180 = Noval socket, B9A pinout.  Usage Outside of Television Reception  High-Fidelity Audio Equipment Although intended for video signal pre-amplification, the relatively high Mu to bandwidth ratio of the 12BY7 and 12BY7A variants lead to their adoption in audio amplification equipment during the Hi-Fi era. There is some dispute in the audio community as to whether the 12DQ7 and 12BV7 variants are acceptable substitutes when discussing the psychoacoustics of various amplifiers. * Harman Kardon Citation II - Utilized six 12BY7As (three per audio channel) as pre-amplifiers driving four KT88 tetrode final stage amplifiers (two per channel) in a push-pull configuration. When driven to 60 Watts, this configuration resulted in approximately 40 kHz of audio frequency bandwidth (18 Hz - 40 kHz) extending into the ultrasonic range. Radio Transceivers The tube series' wide-bandwidth characteristics lead a number of manufacturers to utilize later variants, such as the 12BY7A as a transmit exciter and/or receive preamplifier in the RF stages of their radios. This RF design remained in use throughout the 1970s and early 1980s even as the other stages were replaced with Solid State components. Equipment using mixed tube & solid-state technologies came to be known as \\"Hybrid\\" or \\"Hybrid Solid State\\".

It is one of the main focal points of the school's modern campus, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Architecture The hall is a large 2-1/2 story red brick structure, with a hip roof and resting on a raised cut stone foundation. The building is visually dominated by a four-story tower, which has an open belfry topped by a pyramidal roof. The main entry is in the base of the tower, with a triple window above, and a Palladian window in the third level. The hall's shape is basically rectangular, with pairs of chimneys at each end, and gabled dormers in each roof section. As designed by Stevens, the building's interior included an assembly hall, a library, seven classrooms, a science lab, and music and art studios. Hebron Academy was established in 1804, and is one of the oldest University-preparatory schools in the country. By the 1880s its existing facilities were recognized as inadequate, and the school began fundraising for a building campaign. Its single largest donor was Benjamin Sturtevant, for whom this hall and Sturtevant House (built 1900) are named. Stevens, a prolific and influential architect based in Portland, designed this hall and three other buildings now standing on the academy's campus.

On August 14, 2014, Sona was found guilty; however, Justice Hearn noted that Sona had likely not acted alone. The Court found that Sona displayed a \\"callous and blatant disregard for the right of people to vote\\" as part of an \\"ill-conceived and disturbing plan\\". No one else has been charged or convicted in relation to this matter. Sona was the first and, to date, only person ever convicted of endeavouring to prevent an elector from voting.R. v.

It is one of the oldest planned suburbs of the Cantonment, and was earlier known as Knoxpet, and was later changed to Murphy Town. It is located North of Ulsoor, with Murphy Road running along its periphery, and is also bounded by Old Madras Road and Kensington Road, with part of Kensington Road overlooking Ulsoor Lake Madras Sappers. Knoxpet In the early 1900s the suburb was known as Knoxpet, named after Lt. Col. Stuart George Knox, who served as Resident of Mysore and Coorg between 1 November 1921 to 31 October 1922, and earlier as Resident of Baroda State. The suburb was settled since 1865 by Tamil workers such as tannery workers, leather workers, pottery workers, etc. The houses at Knoxpet had poor sanitation facilities and generally poorly built, and resembled a slum. The Bangalore Plague of 1898, resulted in the government deciding to demolish, rebuild and re-settle the suburb. However actual process was started only in 1923. In 1937, the suburb was renamed as Murphy Town, after W H Murphy, MBE - Executive Engineer, Municipal Council, Bangalore Civil and Military Station. W H Murphy W H Murphy, served as the Executive Engineer, Municipal Council, Bangalore Civil and Military Station for nearly 25 years. Murphy is credited with designing the sanitation works at Austin Town, and the underground drainage works at (then known as BlackPalli). He is responsible for designing and execution of some of Bangalore Cantonment's prominent buildings, such as Russell Market, which is named after T B Russell who served as Municipal Commissioner, Bangalore. He also designed and built the Friend In Need Society and Colonel Hill High School, with buildings known as Cobb Home for the Aged (after H V Cobb, Resident of Mysore) and Girdlestone Nursing Home (after C E R Girdlestone, Resident of Mysore), inaugurated W P Barton (British Resident). Murphy was also credited with inventing the Dog Electrocute, which was used to kill stray dogs painlessly, and extensively used in the Bangalore Cantonment since November 1925. Murphy was also one of the founding members of the Rotary Club of Bangalore (founded 27 October 1934). Town plan Cantonment records indicate that 310 single homes and 108 double homes were built, with cement, bricks and Mangalore tiles. There were large open quadrangles, and the houses were around its periphery, and these open spaces provided space for community and social functions. Space was also provided for Temples, Churches and a Market The housing scheme at Murphy Town was based on three defining principles. Firstly, the houses should be 'too good for the classes that occupy them' \\\\- the intention was to people to grain self-respect. Secondly, 'the dull uniformity of barracks' must not be implemented - as it proved to be a hindrance to social elevation. Finally, the houses were built with scope for further expansion if economic conditions improved. The Houses had postal addresses named as \\"SQUARE\\" (instead of Lane, Street or Cross) based on 9 numbers of the Squares consisting of Houses making it a Proper square, with Each of the \\"SQUARE\\" having an Playground for recreational use of the Residents ( Hence you see the locality producing so many National level Footballers & Hockey Players even till date). Residents of Murphy Town Like in other suburbs of the Bangalore Cantonment, Murphy Town has a large Tamil population with Kannada & Telugu speaking Residents too. They trace their ancestry to the large number of Tamil soldiers, suppliers and workers who were brought into the Bangalore Civil and Military Station, by the British Army, after the fall of Tippu Sultan.It is said that half of the Tamil soldier ancestors of the Murphy town residents were from The Madras Sappers. Murphy Town along with other suburbs of the Bangalore Cantonment was directly under the administration of the British Madras Presidency till 1949, when it was handed over to the Mysore State. Like other poverty stricken areas of the world, Murphy Town, along with Austin Town has produced many good football players, with the sport being very popular in the suburb.this town has produced national & international Hockey players, coaches. Even today Free Football & Hockey coaching is conducted for kids. Primrose Hockey Club One of the Oldest Private Hockey clubs in Karnataka was started here in 1959. There are some 37 houses in Murphy Town where the residents pay a nominal rent to BBMP, with the rates staying low as fixed by the British Authorities of the erstwhile Bangalore Cantonment. After independence, the residents met Murphy to get ownership papers, however these 37 houses were left without proper land papers. According to residents, they are still looked down as immigrants by government departments, even though they have been living in Bangalore than most other people in the city. The Street names in Murphy Town are named after Mudaliars, who were prominent businessmen in the community. The Town Government School had produced several IAS officers,Doctors,Engineers, scientists, politicians, teachers. Ex Municipal councillor shri. Bhaskaran was elected several times as councillor and was honorary Deputy Mayor of bangalore. Under his guidance hundreds of old Murphy Town residents got B.D.A sites in Indira Nagar and Neighborood areas, many moved away to these new development areas( but they do a mandatory customary annual visit to celebrate Ulsoor pallike with their relatives & friends), The local school bearing the plaque ‚Äò1913 Elementary School‚Äô, used to a Tamil Medium School, which has now been converted to Kannada Medium. The school has an old dilapidated building called the 'Evelyn Barton Welfare Centre‚Äô, which has since been closed as its too dangerous. According to the Principal of the School, local residents prefer to give their children English Medium Education from the numerous other schools nearby. The Murphy Town Market is known for its Meat shops selling Chicken, Mutton, Beef and Fish. One of the shops in the Murphy Town Market, VM Stores is 100 years old, and is one of the oldest stores in the Market. Most of the shops 8x10 ft2, and the rent is minimal at INR 110. However, if a shop ownership is transferred, then the rent gets increased to INR 1000. Present state In November 2014, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike's (BBMP) decided to raze 18 old markets (including Murphy Town Market). This move has been opposed by heritage lovers, INTACH Bangalore and other groups. A campaign was being led by Kiran Natarajan, Bangalore's well known architect to stop the demolition of heritage markets. In 1998, the BBMP renamed Murphy Town as Hoysala Nagar, after an ancient Kingdom which ruled the Deccan. However, the name has not caught on and continues to be popularly known as Murphy Town.

From its source in Zaghouan it flows a total of 132 km, making it amongst the longest aqueducts in the Roman Empire.  Date  The date of the construction of the aqueduct is not entirely clear. Sources mention a visit by the Emperor Hadrian in 128, with which a five-year-long drought is meant to have come to an end. The water shortage resulting from the drought might have convinced him that the people should not rely only on rainwater any more. A second event which might have inspired it was the opening of the Baths of Antonius in Carthage in 162. These facilities on the same scale as the Imperial baths in Rome demanded a steady supply of water, which could not be fulfilled with rain water.  Sources  Remains of the sacred spring at Zaghouan The aqueduct draws on several sources which ran dry at different times. The first and most important source is located near the town of Zaghouan in the Djebel Zaghouan, a mountain range about 60 km south of Carthage. In Roman times a sacred fountain structure was built over the spring, which became one of the most important in ancient North Africa.  Description  The sacred fountain is located on an artificial terrace. It is open on the north side, and on the southern side there is an open space enclosed by a , crescent-shaped portico. In the centre of the portico is a cella from which the spring sprang. The outer wall had a core of Roman concrete covered with coarse limestone bossages. This wall continued from the ends of the crescent shaped portico and was divided into 26 sections be engaged columns. In every second section there is a niche for statues, which do not survive. Opposite each engaged column is a full column, which together once supported a vaulted peristyle. The vaults are made of porous travertine covered in marble, while the columns are sandstone. The exterior of the vault was sealed with waterproof Opus signinum and left without further protection. The floor of the portico was decorated with mosaic. The cella, as the most important part of the building was built from limestone and clad in marble.  Intake  There were five springs in the area of the sacred fountain. These were in the area of the artificial terrace in their original, underground bed and gathered in a basin under the terrace. From this basin the water then flowed into the pipe of the aqueduct. As well as feeding the aqueduct intake, the basin also served to clean the water - while the water sat in the basin, impurities would settle on the bottom.  Second source  In Severan times, a second source was attached to the aqueduct. This was located in the region of Djouggar. A sacred fountain was built over this spring too, but it never reached the significance of the one at Zaghouan.  Water channel  Map of the channels running from Zaghouan and Jouggar to Tunis (1928) Restored section on the plane of La Soukra, shortly before Carthage  Technical data  The aqueduct is a masterpiece of Roman engineering. In the journey from Zaghouan to Carthage, it travels a little over 90 km and drops only 264 m in height, which is an average decline of 0.3%. However, 130 m of the height difference occurs in the first 6 km from Zaghouan to Moghrane. For the rest of the journey to Carthage, the decline averages only 0.15%. In Moghrane the aqueduct met the later channel coming from Djouggar, another 33 km away. Including all its tributary channels, the aqueduct has a length of 132 km and is among the longest in the Roman empire. The channel discharged between 200 and 370 l of water per second or between 17 and 32 million litres per day. The flow rate was around 3.5 and 5.5 km per hour. Therefore, the water made the journey from Zaghouan to Carthage in between a day and a half and two days.  Course  The channel was built such that it had a steady, if not uniform, fall, so that the water would travel the route by the force of gravity alone. In order to minimise the building work, the channel was laid on or a little under the Earth's surface where possible. In order to avoid unnecessary loss of height, the channel follows the countours of hills. In three places it was not possible for the channel to remain at ground level, so the engineers erected imposing arcades. They are: * The plain of Oudna: 5 km, including a bridge on a double arcade with a height of 33 m. This bridge was demolished in 1859 in order to reuse the stone for the construction of a new bridge. * The plain of Miliane: 2 km, the arcade reaches up to 20 m in height. * The plain of La Soukra, before Carthage: 10 km, the arcade reaches up to 20 m in height.  Cross-section  In cross-section, the channel measures about 90 cm in width and 130 cm in height. It was closed on top by a vault. The walls were made from Roman cement and were clad with sandstone bossage. The part of the channel which came in contact with water was further clad in waterproof opus signinum. The screed also served to smooth the channel's rate of decline. Ventilation was provided by small, square openings in the roof. At regular intervals on the base of the channel there were circular depressions, which served to purify the water, since detritus would settle in them. To continue to operate, these had to be cleaned out regularly, so the channel required ongoing care and attention  Cisterns  View of a vault of the cistern at La Malga The distribution of the water within Carthage is not yet entirely clear. It seems that the channel discharged into two cisterns and the water was further distributed from these. To date, however, archaeological excavations have found no sure signs of discharge into the cisterns.  Cisterns of La Malga  The cisterns of La Malga form the largest cisterns surviving from the ancient world anywhere. They held approximately 51 million litres. Based on the nature of the mortar, they are dated to the first century AD. It is not yet clear how these cisterns were used in that period, since the aqueduct had not yet been built and this enormous volume could never have been filled by rainwater alone.  Cistern of Bordj Djedid  The cistern of Bordj Djedid is made up of 18 barrel-shaped basins arranged in parallel and held between 25 and 30 million litres. It was responsible for supplying the Baths of Antonius. The construction date is unknown, but modifications have been detected in connection with the construction of the Baths of Antonius, implying that the cistern preceded the baths.  Later usage  Since the water supply was essential for the city, the aqueduct was destroyed during the Vandal siege of 439, the Eastern Roman reconquest under Justinian and finally at the conquest of Carthage by the Arabs in 698, but each time it was subsequently restored. In the thirteenth century one of the Hafsid rulers added a branch leading to his palace in Manouba in order to supply water for his garden. From the sixteenth century, the aqueduct deteriorated rapidly and was employed as a stone quarry. In 1859 a French engineer received the task of restoring the water channel in order to supply Tunis with water. While the majority of the channels at ground level could be reused, the parts of the channel on pillars were mostly destroyed and a modern pressure pipe system was installed. Since it was put into operation in 1862, the channel has remained in use and today it supplies an average of 12,000,000 L per day in winter and 3,000,000 in summer.

Perspective early warning system reveals ballistic missile launches and destroys them in the active phase of flight. Points of view USA According to American military experts, deploying a missile defense system should strengthen security in the region and become a guarantee of non-aggression in the foreseeable future of the DPRK on the Republic of Korea (ROK) or Japan, and, consequently, to the United States. From 17 to 23 August 2014, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert O. Work made a working tour of the Asia-Pacific region, during which he met with the heads of the defense ministries of the ROK and Japan, visited Guam and Hawaii. During the meetings the issues of counter-terrorism, global security and missile defense were discussed. The direction of the US policy to strengthen its influence in the Asia-Pacific region is due to the increasing economic and military potential of China. That also confirms the US desire to form a new alliance of \\"security\\" in the Asia- Pacific region, ignoring the positions of Russia and China. The new alliance, forming in the Asia-Pacific region can consist of the Philippines, Australia, and Japan, with the possible participation of Singapore and Thailand. In addition, Washington considers Malaysia as a strategic partner. According to the military experts, the deployment of US missile defense segment in the region shows the uncertainty of the US leadership in the undeniable advantages of the contingent of troops that is used in an armed conflict with China and North Korea in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait and the East China Sea, and Russia in the Kuril Islands. The elements of the US missile defense system, as well as all military installations outside the territory of the state, are the property of the United States, and are aimed to protect their own interests in the first place. SCO member states SCO member states were critical of the unilateral strengthening of US missile defense system, regarding it as a threat to global security. China According to the statements made by Chinese officials, deploying a missile defense system in Northeast Asia (near the borders of China) will lead to a security violation in the region. Russian Federation The point of view of the Russian government clearly defines the deployment of US missile defense system in the Asia-Pacific region as a security threat. \\"We will be adequate and response proportionately to NATO's military infrastructure pushing to our borders and do not leave deployment of a global missile defense and upbuilding strategic stocks of precision weapons unattended.\\" \\\\- Vladimir Putin. According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense, Russian authority is confident in the adverse effect of the deployment of the US missile defense system on the military-political situation in Asia-Pacific and the world. Russian scientists say that the elements of the US missile defense system can adversely affect the health of people living in its vicinity. Japan Japan continues a policy of strengthening existing bilateral alliances (primarily with the USA) and developing relationships with prospective partners, among which is India. In 2014, together with the US Navy \\"Standard-3\\" shipborne missiles tests were conducted. According to Chinese media, in October 2014 the US military brought missile defense forces X-band radar to the base of the Armed forces of the United States in Kyoto, the commissioning of which must occur before the end of 2014. North Korea North Korea continues the course of increasing and strengthening its missile forces. On August 14, 2014 it launched the five short-range missiles KY-09, that were carried out in response to the intention of the ROC and the United States to carry out annual joint military exercises \\"Ulchi-Freedom Guardian\\". After the start of the exercise, the North Korean leadership has once again accused the ROC and the United States in preparation for the invasion of North Korea and the threat of pre-emptive strike on the territory of South Korea. Also, the North Korean leadership said that it will increase its nuclear capabilities \\"in the case of deployment of the US mobile complexes THAAD on the territory of the Republic of Korea.\\" Pyongyang was particularly irritated by the fact that the United States implement their plans in Asia Pacific under the pretext of combating the \\"threat from the North.\\" South Korea The Republic of Korea (ROK) is a strategic partner of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region. And the question of the development of joint missile defense system aimed primarily against its northern neighbor is no exception. Currently, South Korea has already placed the US anti-missile complexes \\"Patriot\\" PAC-2. In the future, the THAAD system will be built. Deputy Minister of Defense: \\"We have explained to China and Russia, that it is not strategic missile defense systems. THAAD is designed to support regional security and prevent threats directed against the United States and our allies. We continue to work together with the Chinese and Russian, to dispel any of their concerns that THAAD may pose a threat to their strategic missile systems.\\" Leaders of ROK shall make every possible effort to coordinate the actions of major countries of Northeast Asia in the issue of nuclear safety, that is expressed in the proposal of President Park Geun-hye to create a consultative body for nuclear safety in Northeast Asia. According to an official statement of the President of South Korea, the main participants of that body will become South Korea, China and Japan. However, Park Geun-hye added, that Russia, the US, North Korea, and Mongolia will also participate in the meetings and negotiations on key issues of regional security. Seoul still retains a cautious stance, as the deployment of any US missile defense systems will be perceived as taking part in the US-led missile defense program. The ROK leaders also have concerns that the integration of its missile defense system with the US missile defense system could lead to diplomatic tension with China, the largest trading partner of South Korea.

Robert E. Lee, and the Union Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan. It was the final battle of the Seven Days Battles during the American Civil War, taking place on a elevation of land known as Malvern Hill, near the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia and just one mile (1.6 km) from the James River. Including inactive reserves, more than fifty thousand soldiers from each side took part, using more than two hundred pieces of artillery and three warships. The Seven Days Battles were the climax of the Peninsula Campaign, during which McClellan's Army of the Potomac sailed around the Confederate lines, landed at the tip of the Virginia Peninsula, southeast of Richmond, and struck inland towards the Confederate capital. Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston fended off McClellan's repeated attempts to take the city, slowing Union progress on the peninsula to a crawl. When Johnston was wounded, Lee took command and launched a series of counterattacks, collectively called the Seven Days Battles. These attacks culminated in the action on Malvern Hill. The Union's V Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, took up positions on the hill on June30. McClellan was not present for the initial exchanges of the battle, having boarded the ironclad USS Galena and sailed down the James River to inspect Harrison's Landing, where he intended to locate the base for his army. Confederate preparations were hindered by several mishaps. Bad maps and faulty guides caused Confederate Maj. Gen. John Magruder to be late for the battle, an excess of caution delayed Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger, and Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson had problems collecting the Confederate artillery. The battle occurred in stages: an initial exchange of artillery fire, a minor charge by Confederate Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead, and three successive waves of Confederate infantry charges triggered by unclear orders from Lee and the actions of Maj. Gens. Magruder and D. H. Hill, respectively. In each phase, the effectiveness of the Federal artillery was the deciding factor, repulsing attack after attack, resulting in a tactical Union victory. In the course of four hours, a series of blunders in planning and communication had caused Lee's forces to launch three failed frontal infantry assaults across hundreds of yards of open ground, unsupported by Confederate artillery, charging toward firmly entrenched Union infantry and artillery defenses. These errors provided Union forces with an opportunity to inflict heavy casualties. After the battle, McClellan and his forces withdrew from Malvern Hill to Harrison's Landing, where he remained until August 16. His plan to capture Richmond had been thwarted. The Confederate press heralded Lee as the savior of Richmond. In stark contrast, McClellan was accused of being absent from the battlefield, a harsh criticism that haunted him when he ran for president in 1864.  Background   Military situation  In spring 1862, Union commander Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan developed an ambitious plan to capture Richmond, the Confederate capital, on the Virginia Peninsula. His 121,500-man Army of the Potomac, along with 14,592 animals, 1,224 wagons and ambulances, and 44 artillery batteries, would load onto 389 vessels and sail to the tip of the peninsula at Fort Monroe, then move inland and capture the capital, some 80 miles away. The bold and sweeping landing was executed with few incidents, but the Federals were delayed for about a month in the Siege of Yorktown. When McClellan's army finally did attack on May4, the defensive earthworks around Yorktown were undefended. After some hours, the Army of the Potomac pursued the retreating Confederates. When Union troops encountered the Confederate rearguard at Williamsburg, the two armies fought an inconclusive battle. The Confederates continued their withdrawal that night. To stymie the Southerners' retreat, McClellan sent Brig. Gen. William F. \\"Baldy\\" Smith to Eltham's Landing by boat, resulting in a battle there on May7. When the Union Army tried to attack Richmond by way of the James River, they were turned back at Drewry's Bluff on May15. All the while, McClellan continued his pursuit of Confederate forces, who were withdrawing quickly towards Richmond. The lack of decisive action on the Virginia Peninsula spurred President Abraham Lincoln to order McClellan's army to move into positions close to Richmond. By May30, McClellan had begun moving troops across the Chickahominy River, the only major natural barrier that separated his army from Richmond.; However, heavy rains and thunderstorms on the night of May30 caused the water level to swell, washing away two bridges and splitting the Federal army in two across the Chickahominy. In the subsequent Battle of Seven Pines, Confederate general-in-chief Joseph E. Johnston sought to capitalize on the bifurcation of McClellan's army, attacking the half of the Union Army that was stuck south of the river. Johnston's plan fell apart, and McClellan lost no ground. Late in the battle, Johnston was hit in the right shoulder by a bullet and in the chest by a shell fragment; his command went to Maj. Gen. Gustavus W. Smith. Smith's tenure as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia was short. On June1, after an unsuccessful attack on Union forces, Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy, appointed Robert E. Lee, his own military adviser, to replace Smith as the commander-in- chief of the Confederate armies. The subsequent two weeks on the peninsula were mostly quiet. On June25, though, a surprise attack by McClellan began a series of six major battles over the next week near Richmond‚Äîthe Seven Days Battles. On the first day, as Lee led the Army of Northern Virginia toward the Union lines, McClellan preempted him with an attack at Oak Grove. Lee's men successfully warded off the Union assault, and Lee continued with his plans. The next morning, the Confederates attacked the Army of the Potomac at Mechanicsville. Union forces turned back the Confederate onslaught, inflicting heavy losses. After Mechanicsville, McClellan's army withdrew to a position behind Boatswain's Swamp. There, on June27, the Union soldiers suffered another Confederate attack, this time at Gaines's Mill. In the resulting battle, the Confederates launched numerous failed charges, until a final concerted attack broke the Union line, resulting in the only clear Confederate victory during the Seven Days. The action at Garnett's and Golding's Farm, fought next, was merely a set of skirmishes. Lee attacked the Union Army at the Battle of Savage's Station on June29 and the battles of Glendale and White Oak Swamp June30, but all three battles were inconclusive. After this series of conflicts that inflicted thousands of casualties on both armies, McClellan began to assemble his forces in an imposing natural position atop Malvern Hill.  Geography and location  Malvern Hill, a plateau-like elevation in Henrico County, Virginia, provided an impressive natural military position about two miles (3.2 km) north of the James River. The hill rose some to its crest to form a crescent about in length and wide. Its slope was about in length and very gradual, with only one or two notable depressions. Along the western side of the hill ran Malvern Cliffs, a bluff-like formation that overlooked Turkey Run, a tributary of nearby Turkey Island Creek. Western Run was another tributary of Turkey Island Creek, which lay mostly along the eastern side of the hill and slanted slightly into the northern side. One depression dipped some at the valley of Western Run and slanted upwards to the plateau. Malvern Hill's center was slightly lower than the flanks. The gentle, bare slant meant that any assailing army could not easily take cover, and artillery would have the benefit of a clear, open field.; The Malvern House Several farms were positioned near Malvern Hill. Roughly north of the hill were the Poindexter and Carter farms. Between the two farms was a swampy and thickly wooded area that made up the course of Western Run. The largest in the area was the Mellert family's farm, usually called the Crew farm for a former owner, situated at the western side of the hill. About a quarter of a mile due east of Malvern Hill was the West farm. Between these two farms lay the Willis Church Road, which some locals called the Quaker Road. This road also ran past the Malvern house, the hill's namesake, which was perched atop the southern edge of the plateau. \\"It was, altogether, an exceedingly formidable position\\", wrote historian Douglas Southall Freeman. \\"Had the Union engineers searched the whole countryside below Richmond, they could not have found ground more ideally set for the slaughter of an attacking army.\\"  Prelude   Key participants   McClellan's forces prepare  The gentle slope of the hill has been cleared to show the open ground in front of the Union cannon, as it was on the date of the battle. A few days prior to the action on Malvern Hill, McClellan incorrectly believed the Army of the Potomac was vastly outnumbered by its Confederate foe, and his fear of being cut off from his supply depot left him cautious and wary. On the night of June28, McClellan told his generals he intended to move his army to a position on the north bank of the James River called Harrison's Landing, where they would be protected by Union gunboats. The Army of the Potomac came to Malvern Hill, the army's final stop before reaching the Landing, with approximately 54,000 men. On the morning of June30, 1862, the Union V Corps under Fitz John Porter, a part of McClellan's Army of the Potomac, amassed atop Malvern Hill. Col. Henry Hunt, McClellan's skilled chief of artillery, posted 171 guns on the hill and 91 more in reserve in the south. The artillery line on the hill's slope consisted of eight batteries of field artillery with 37 guns. Brig. Gen. George Sykes's division would guard the line. In reserve were additional field artillery and three batteries of heavy artillery, which included five 4.5-inch (11 cm) Rodman guns, five 20-pounder (9.1 kg) Parrott rifles and six 32-pounder (15 kg) howitzers. As more of McClellan's forces arrived at the hill, Porter continued to reinforce the Union line. Brig. Gen. George Morell's units, stationed between the Crew and West farms, extended the line to the northeastern section. Brig. Gen. Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, as yet unbloodied by the skirmishes of the Seven Days, further extended the northeastern line. This left 17,800 soldiers from Couch's and Morell's divisions at the northern face of the hill, overlooking the Quaker Road, from which the Federals expected Lee's forces to attack. Early the next day, Tuesday, July 1, McClellan, having come from nearby Haxall's Landing the night before, examined his army's battle line on Malvern Hill. His inspection left him worried most about the Union Army's right (eastern) flank, which lay behind Western Run. Western Run was an area necessary for McClellan's plans to relocate to Harrison's Landing, and he feared an attack might come from there. As a result, he posted the largest portion of his army there: two divisions from Edwin Sumner's II Corps, two divisions from Brig. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman's III Corps, two divisions from Brig. Gen. William Franklin's VI Corps and one division from Maj. Gen. Erasmus Keyes's IV Corps, who were stationed across the James. The division under Brig. Gen. George McCall, badly mangled in the fighting at Glendale and having lost McCall and two of its three brigadiers, was held in general reserve.; McClellan did not believe his army was ready for a battle, and hoped Lee would not give them one. Nonetheless, he left his troops at Malvern Hill and traveled downstream aboard the ironclad USS Galena to inspect his army's future resting place at Harrison's Landing. McClellan did not delegate an interim commander; Porter, who was in command during the initial attack, became the de facto leader on the Union side of the battle.  Lee's forces advance  With around 55,000 soldiers, the Army of Northern Virginia was about evenly matched with the Federals, and with Lee at the helm, notably more aggressive. He wanted a final, decisive attack that would effectively scatter the Federals. Several pieces of evidence‚Äîabandoned commissary stores, wagons and arms, and the hundreds of Union stragglers and deserters his units had happened upon and captured‚Äîled Lee to conclude that the Army of the Potomac was demoralized and retreating. In all the battles up to Malvern Hill, Lee's plans to destroy the Federal army had failed for one reason or another. Though he was undeterred, his chances for decisive victory were diminishing quickly. Early on the morning of the battle, Lee met with his lieutenants, including Maj. Gens. James Longstreet, A. P. Hill, Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, John Magruder and D. H. Hill. D. H. Hill, after talking with a chaplain familiar with the geography of Malvern Hill, cautioned against mounting an attack. \\"If General McClellan is there in strength,\\" Hill said, \\"we had better let him alone.\\" Longstreet laughed off Hill's objections, saying \\"Don't get so scared, now that we've got him [McClellan] whipped.\\" Lee chose the relatively well-rested commands of D. H. Hill, Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder to lead the Confederate offensive, as they had barely participated in the fighting of the day before. James Longstreet and A.P. Hill's divisions were held in reserve as they were in no condition to fight after Glendale, with almost half their officers and close to a quarter of the enlisted men killed or wounded. Brig. Gen Winfield Featherston's brigade was temporarily commanded by Brig. Gen George B. Anderson of D.H. Hill's division, as there was nobody left in the brigade above the rank of major. According to Lee's plan, the Army of Northern Virginia would form a semi-circle enveloping Malvern Hill. D. H. Hill's five brigades would be placed along the northern face of the hill, forming the center of the Confederate line, and the commands of Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder would take the left and right flanks, respectively. Whiting's forces would position themselves on the Poindexter farm, with the outfits of Brig. Gen. Charles Sidney Winder and Richard Ewell nearby. The infantry of these three detachments would provide reinforcement for the Confederate line if necessary. Two veteran generals rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia for the battle, Brig. Gen Wade Hampton and Brig. Gen Jubal Early, both wounded two months earlier. Hampton and Early were given command of two of Jackson's brigades which had lost their commanders at Gaines Mill and had only inexperienced colonels to lead them. Maj. Gen. Theophilus Holmes would take up a position on the extreme Confederate right flank.  Disposition of armies  The Army of the Potomac's disposition in the lead-up to the battle was more orderly than Lee's Army of Northern Virginia; all of McClellan's forces would be concentrated in one place, save for Erasmus Keyes and one of his two divisions, which were stationed across the James River. A Confederate scout observed Union soldiers resting in position, and moving about the hill unworried, whilst the disposition of the cannons around the hill's slope gave him the impression that the position was \\"almost impregnable\\". McClellan's army was on the hill in force. This map of the Malvern Hill battlefield labels the Willis Church Road as \\"Quaker Road\\". Magruder's \\"Quaker Road\\" branched off of the Long Bridge Road, which appears in the upper left corner. Throughout the Seven Days Battles, Lee's forces had been separated and scattered due to swamps, narrow roads and other geographic obstacles, and occasionally due to unclear orders. As the days of marching and fighting wore on the number of stragglers swelled to fill narrow roads and significantly deplete the Confederate ranks, presenting a significant additional strain on their combat readiness. These hindrances continued during the Battle of Malvern Hill, with both Magruder and Huger making mistakes in the deployment of their forces. At first, Magruder's units were behind Stonewall Jackson's column while marching down the Long Bridge Road, which led to Malvern Hill. Along this road were several adjoining pathways. One such road, called the Willis Church Road by some locals and the Quaker Road by others, led south from Glendale to Malvern Hill. Lee's maps labeled this \\"Quaker Road\\". Another of these paths began near a local farm and angled southwest toward an upriver point on the River Road‚Äîsome locals called this the Quaker Road, including Magruder's guides, who led Magruder's army down this road rather than the Quaker Road shown on Lee's maps. James Longstreet eventually rode after Magruder, and persuaded him to reverse course. This incident delayed Magruder's arrival to the battlefield for three hours. Huger, worried about clashing with Union forces while marching towards Malvern Hill, had also failed to manage his division effectively. He deployed two of his brigades, commanded by Brig. Gens. Lewis Armistead and Ambrose Wright, to perform a flanking maneuver around any Federals they found, to avoid the Union threat. Longstreet eventually notified Huger that he would be unobstructed by Federal forces if he marched to Malvern Hill. Huger, however, remained in place until someone from Lee's headquarters came to guide them to the battlefield. As noon drew near with no sight of either Huger or Magruder, who were supposed to be manning the Confederate right flank, Lee replaced these two forces with the smaller units of Brig. Gens. Armistead and Wright, two of Huger's brigades that had reached the battlefield some time earlier. Huger and his other two brigades (under Brig. Gens. Ransom and Mahone) were still too far north of the scene.; Despite the mishaps and disunity, Malvern Hill would be the first time during the Seven Days Battles that Lee managed to concentrate his force.  Opposing forces   Union   Confederate   Battle  Battle of Malvern Hill; Confederate forces are indicated in red, and Union forces are indicated in blue.  Lee orders artillery crossfire  Lee surveyed the left flank himself for possible artillery positions. After a reconnoitering expedition on the right flank, James Longstreet returned to Lee; the two compared their results and concluded that two grand battery-like positions would be established at the left and right sides of Malvern Hill. The converging artillery fire from the batteries, they reasoned, could weaken the Union line so a Confederate infantry attack could break through. If this plan did not work out, Lee and Longstreet felt the artillery fire would buy them time to consider other plans. With a battle plan in order, Lee sent a draft to his lieutenants, written by his chief of staff, Col. Robert Chilton (see right box). The orders were not well-crafted, however, since they designated the yell of a single charging brigade as the only signal of attack for a full fifteen brigades. Amid the tumult and clamor of battle, this was bound to create confusion. Moreover, Chilton's draft effectively left the attack solely at the discretion of Lewis Armistead, who had never before held command of a brigade during battle. The draft also did not note the time it had been written, which later caused confusion for Magruder.  Failed Confederate barrage  upright=1.2 Beginning around 1 pm, Union artillery fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, and later upon any Confederate artillery that attempted to move into firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were near the center of the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.; ; On the Confederate right flank a total of six batteries engaged the Federals, but they did so one-by- one instead of in unison, and each was consecutively cut to pieces by concentrated Union artillery fire. Moreover, they engaged the Union artillery later than the guns of the left flank, so the desired crossfire bombardment was never achieved. The cannons on the modern-day battlefield at Malvern Hill In all, the Confederate artillery barrage on both flanks completely failed to achieve its objectives. Confederate fire did manage to kill Capt. John E. Beam of the Union's 1st New Jersey Artillery, along with a few others, and several Federal batteries (though none that were actually engaged) had to move to avoid the fire. Although the barrage by Lee's forces did claim a few lives, Union forces remained unfazed and continued their fearsome barrage. Indeed, Union Army Lt. Charles B. Haydon supposedly fell asleep during the artillery fight. On both the left and right flanks, several of the batteries that did engage lasted no more than minutes before being rendered incapable of fire. Moreover, in a failure of command that, according to historian Thomas M. Settles, must ultimately be placed on Lee's shoulders, the movements of the two flanks were never coordinated with each other. D. H. Hill found the failure of the Confederate artillery discouraging and later dismissed the barrage as \\"most farcical\\". Meanwhile, the Union artillery fire was planned and directed nearly flawlessly. As historian Jennings Cropper Wise notes, Col. Hunt, McClellan's chief of artillery, continuously refocused Union fire on various fronts, in an \\"enormous sheaf of fire of more than 50 superior pieces, disabling four of Huger's and several of Jackson's batteries almost the instant they came into action\\". This severely hampered the Confederates' ability to respond effectively to the Federal barrage. The Union artillery subdued a number of the Southerners' batteries; those few that remained attacked piecemeal, and failed to produce any significant result.  Confederate infantry assaults  Intense Confederate and especially Union artillery fire continued for at least an hour, slackening at about 2:30pm. At about 3:30pm, Lewis Armistead noticed Union skirmishers creeping towards his men where the grand battery on the Confederate right flank was, nearly within rifle range of them. Armistead sent three regiments (about half of his brigade) from his command to push back the skirmishers, thus beginning the infantry part of the battle. The skirmishers were repelled quickly, but Armistead's men found themselves in the midst of an intense Union barrage. The Confederates decided to nestle themselves in a ravine along the hill's slant. This position protected them from the fire, but pinned them down on the slopes of Malvern Hill, unsupported by either infantry or artillery. They did not have enough men to advance any further and retreating would have put them back into the crossfire.  Magruder's charge  Not long after the advance of Armistead's regiments, John Magruder and his men arrived near the battlefield, albeit quite late because of the confusion regarding the names of local roads‚Äîby this time, it was 4pm. Magruder was told at that morning's war council to move to Huger's right, but he was unaware of Huger's position, and sent Major Joseph L. Brent to locate Huger's right flank. Brent found Huger, who said he had no idea where his brigades were. Huger was noticeably upset that his men had been given orders by someone other than himself; Lee had told Huger's two brigades under Armistead and Ambrose Wright to advance to the right part of the Confederate line. Upon hearing of this, Magruder was quite confused. He sent Capt. A. G. Dickinson to find Lee and inform him of the \\"successful\\" charge of Armistead's men and request further orders. Contrary to this message, Armistead was in fact pinned down halfway up Malvern Hill. At the same time, Whiting sent Lee an incorrect report that Union forces were retreating. Whiting had mistaken two events for a Federal withdrawal‚Äîthe movement of Edwin Sumner's troops, who were adjusting their position to avoid the Confederate fire, and the relaxing of Union fire on his side, which was actually the Union artillery concentrating their firepower to a different front.; Whiting and Magruder's erroneous reports led Lee to send a draft of orders to Magruder via Dickinson: \\"General Lee expects you to advance rapidly\\", wrote Dickinson. \\"He says it is reported that the enemy is [retreating]. Press forward your whole line and follow up Armistead's success.\\" Before Dickinson returned with these orders, Magruder was belatedly handed the order sent out three hours previously (at 1:30 pm) by Chilton. Since no time was affixed to the text of the orders, Magruder was unaware that these orders had been rendered meaningless by the failure of the Confederate artillery during the past few hours, and believed he had received two successive orders from Lee to attack. Union sharpshooters of the 1st United States Sharpshooters fire on the Confederates. Believing himself bound by Lee's order to charge, but with his own brigades not yet in attacking position, Magruder mustered some five thousand men from Huger's brigades, including those of Ambrose Wright and Maj. Gen. William Mahone and half of the men from Armistead's brigade who were caught in the open battlefield. Magruder had also sent for Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom, Jr., also under Huger's command, who noted that he had been given strict instructions to ignore any orders not originating from Huger, and apologetically said he could not help Magruder. Magruder additionally ordered men under his personal command‚Äîthree regiments of Brig. Gen. Howell Cobb's brigade, plus Col. William Barksdale's full brigade‚Äîto the attack. Because of the confusion regarding Quaker Road, however, these brigades were not yet near enough to do more than move into supporting position, and Magruder wanted to attack immediately.; Despite this, under Magruder's order at about 5:30pm, Wright's brigade with Armistead's, then Mahone's brigade, started darting out of the woods and towards the Union line. The artillery of the Confederate left flank, under Jackson's personal command, also renewed their barrage with the late arrival of two batteries of Richard Ewell's division. The Confederates were initially engaged solely by Union sharpshooters, but the latter quickly fell back to give their own artillery a clear field of fire. Antipersonnel canister shot was employed with deadly effect. Wright's men were pinned down in a small depression on the rolling hillside, to the right of Armistead's; Mahone's were driven back into retreat in about the same area. At some point during the first wave of assaults, Cobb moved into close supporting position behind Armistead. Barksdale's men were also supporting, to the left of Armistead. The firefight also alerted the three Union boats on the James‚Äîthe ironclad USS Galena, and the gunboats USS Jacob Bell and USS Aroostook‚Äîwhich began lobbing missiles in length and in diameter from their position on the James River onto the battlefield.; ; ; The explosions and impacts of the gunboat fire impressed the Confederate troops, but the guns' aim was unreliable, and the large shells did considerably less damage than might have been expected.  Hill's charge  Artillery antipersonnel shot-canister for a 12-pounder (5.4 kg) cannon from the Civil War era D. H. Hill had been discouraged by the failure of the Confederate artillery, and asked Stonewall Jackson to supplement Chilton's draft. Jackson's response was that Hill should obey the original orders: charge with a yell after Armistead's brigade. No yell was heard for hours, and Hill's men began building bivouac shelters to sleep in. Around 6 pm Hill and his five brigade commanders had assumed that the lack of a signal meant their army would not attempt any assault. They were conferring together about Chilton's order when they heard yells and the commotion of a charge from their right flank, roughly where Armistead was supposed to be. Hill took the yell as the signal and shouted to his commanders, \\"That must be the general advance. Bring up your brigades as soon as possible and join in it.\\" D. H. Hill's five brigades, with some 8,200 men, had to contend with the dense woodlands around the Quaker Road and Western Run, which destroyed any order they may have had. Men advanced out of the woods towards the Union line in five separate, uncoordinated attacks, and each brigade charged up the hill alone: \\"We crossed one fence, went through another piece of woods, then over another fence [and] into an open field on the other side of which was a long line of Yankees\\", wrote William Calder of the 2nd Regiment, North Carolina Infantry. \\"Our men charged gallantly at them. The enemy mowed us down by fifties.\\" Some brigades in Hill's division made it close enough to exchange musket fire and engage in hand-to-hand combat, but these were driven back. The artillery response on the Federal side to Hill's charge was particularly withering, and soon, Hill's men needed support just to hold their ground. In Extraordinary Circumstances: The Seven Days Battles, Brian K. Burton called Hill's charge \\"unnecessary and costly\\". The successive assaults of Hill's brigades on the well-entrenched Federals were short-lived, and achieved little.  Final assaults  Preceding attacks by Lee's army had done barely anything to accomplish Confederate objectives, but this did not deter Magruder, who rode back and forth across the battlefield, calling for reinforcements and personally launching unit after unit into a charge of the Union line. At this point, men who had always been directly under Magruder's command began to join the battle. Magruder first encountered some units of Brig. Gen. Robert Toombs. With Toombs's brigade widely dispersed, the individual units Magruder found were not with Toombs himself. Magruder personally led the men in a short-lived charge, followed by a disordered retreat. Other units nominally under Toombs's command appeared, charged and retreated at various times throughout the next few hours, with little or no organization. The brigades of Col. George T. Anderson and Col. William Barksdale emerged from the woods to the right of Toombs, but as they did so, Anderson's men also became separated, as the left side outpaced the right. This created an advance with two of Anderson's regiments on the far Confederate left next to Toombs, Barksdale's men in the middle, and three more Anderson regiments on the far right, near the remnants of Wright and Mahone. Anderson's right flank charged, but made it no farther than the foot of the hill before breaking and retreating under a hail of antipersonnel artillery. Anderson's left flank never charged. Barksdale's brigade charged at roughly the same time, and made it considerably farther up the hill, engaging the Union infantry of Brig. Gen. Daniel Butterfield in a firefight that lasted more than an hour. Lee received Magruder's calls for reinforcement and instructed Huger to let Ransom go support the men trapped on the field of battle. He also sent orders to the brigades of Brig. Gens. Joseph B. Kershaw and Paul Jones Semmes, in Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws's division within Magruder's command. Robert Ransom's unit, after they finally showed up with Huger's permission, first attempted to charge straight up the hill, following the path of other Confederate brigades attempting to aid Magruder. When this proved useless, Ransom ordered them to regroup in the woods to the Confederate right, march double-time a half a mile in a hook to the right around all the other Confederate units and attack the far Union western flank. While Ransom was angling west, Jackson responded to a request for reinforcement from D. H. Hill by sending forward brigades from his own command to move from the east into the area where D. H. Hill had attacked. From his own division Jackson sent Brig. Gens. Alexander Lawton and Charles S. Winder, and from Ewell's division, Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble and Cols. Leroy A. Stafford and Jubal Early. Brig. Gen John R. Jones was wounded in the hand and command of his brigade went to Lt. Col Richard Cunningham of the 48th Virginia, who had commanded the brigade a few days earlier while Jones was on sick leave. Ransom's men managed to come closer to the Union line than any Confederates that day, guided by the flashing light of the cannons amidst an encroaching darkness; however, George Sykes's artillery repelled that attack.; The brigades of Kershaw and Semmes, sent earlier by Lee, arrived to the front while Ransom was moving to attack in another position. Semmes and Kershaw were quickly sent in; they too were repulsed not long after. Semmes was west of the junction of Carter's Mill Road and Willis Church Road, in the vicinity of Barksdale, Mahone and Wright. Semmes made the final charge of the day west of these roads, and like the charges before, it was to little effect. Kershaw angled east, in the area where Toombs, Anderson and Cobb had attacked. This was an area of great confusion. Kershaw's troops arrived ahead of all the reinforcements sent by Jackson, and took fire from both friendly and hostile forces: from Confederates behind them firing wildly and Federals in front firing effectively. Kershaw's men retreated in rout. The brigades behind Kershaw charged incoherently, with some men pushing forward, and others getting separated from their units or confused when they encountered groups of retreating Confederates. Disorganized, retreating soldiers from various units were so numerous they slowed Jackson's men to nearly a standstill. Jackson's unit commanders attempted to organize their various regiments and rally the retreaters to join in, but it was all to very little effect. A few units fought fiercely against Union infantry and artillery. In particular, three regiments of Barlow's brigade made it close enough to Union lines to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the troops of Brig. Gen. Daniel Sickles before being driven back. As the sun was starting to go down, Brig. Gen Isaac Trimble began to move his brigade forward. Stonewall Jackson asked him what he was planning to do. \\"I am going to charge those batteries, sir!\\" Trimble answered. \\"I guess you'd better not try it. General D.H. Hill has just tried with his entire division and been repulsed. I guess you'd better not try it,\\" Jackson replied. Night was falling, however, and eventually all these troops were ordered to merely hold their positions without charging. In the end, the charges of Semmes and Kershaw were the last coherent Confederate actions, and neither was successful. Brig. Gen. Porter summed up the Confederate infantry charges at Malvern Hill this way: With the infantry part of the battle over, Union artillery continued to boom across the hill. They stopped firing at 8:30pm, leaving a wreath of smoke upon the crest's edge, and ending the action on Malvern Hill.; ;  Aftermath   Casualties  Seventeen-year-old Confederate soldier Edwin Francis Jemison was one of those killed in the battle. The human toll of the Battle of Malvern Hill and the Seven Days Battles was shown clearly as both capitals, Washington and Richmond, set up numerous provisional hospitals to care for the dead, wounded and missing. Ships sailed from the Peninsula to Washington carrying the wounded. Richmond was nearest to the battlefields of the Seven Days, and the immense number of casualties overwhelmed hospitals and doctors. People from about the Confederacy descended upon Richmond to care for the conflict's casualties. Graves could not be dug quickly enough. The Confederates counted some 5,650 casualties. Some 30,000 Confederates engaged that day, though several thousand more endured the Union shelling. Whiting's unit suffered 175 casualties in the Malvern Hill conflict, even though they had limited involvement in the assaults. Charles Winder's brigade of just over 1,000 men suffered 104 casualties in their short involvement in the battle. D. H. Hill spent days removing the wounded, burying the dead and cleaning up the battlefield, with help from Magruder and Huger's units. One of D. H. Hill's brigades lost 41% of its strength at Malvern Hill alone. He later estimated that more than half of all the Confederate killed and wounded at Malvern Hill were as a result of artillery fire. Two Confederate generals were wounded, Brig. Gens George B. Anderson and John R. Jones. No Union officers above the regimental level were killed or wounded.  Reasons for outcome  The battle on Malvern Hill was a resounding Union tactical victory. The victory was due in no small part to Henry Hunt, the Union chief artillerist, who did proficient work in accumulating and concentrating the Union guns. Troop placement before the battle by the army's principal topographical engineer, Col. A. A. Humphreys, was also carried out capably. The ground on Malvern Hill was used effectively and the Union line had depth with a healthy amount of rested troops available to defend it. Fitz John Porter, the de facto commander for the day, played an important role in this. He posted his men well on June30, and stationed reinforcements near to the Union line. Darius Couch, whose forces comprised half of the Union center, positioned his reinforcements skilfully as well and cooperated with George Morell, whose units formed the other part of the Union middle. The infantrymen performed well also. As Brian K. Burton notes, \\"[the infantrymen] stayed behind the guns most of the time and did not advance too far during countercharges. This behavior allowed the gunners a clear field of fire.\\" Furthermore, if more of anything was needed, infantry or artillery, it was available. At the forefront of the Union victory, however, was the overwhelming firepower of their artillery, as later accounts by soldiers from both armies repeatedly attested. A number of shortcomings in planning and execution contributed to the debacle suffered by the Confederates. The Confederate brigade leaders performed well, with the exception of a few minor instances; Burton surmises that the blame of July 1 must lie with the overall commanders. Longstreet was overconfident about the artillery strategy, which proved less effective than it could have been largely because of problems gathering the artillery for the assault. The Confederate practice of moving artillery with individual units instead of in one mass and the difficult terrain surrounding Malvern Hill contributed to this issue. A potential solution to this problem lay with Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton's fourteen batteries in reserve. However, Lee's headquarters never contacted Pendleton, who spent July 1 \\"await[ing] events and orders, in readiness for whatever service might be called for.\\" These orders never came, and Pendleton's batteries went unused. Magruder might also share in the blame; his late arrival to the battlefield was caused by bad maps and faulty guides. Since Magruder received Chilton's draft late in the day, and with no time attached to it, there was no way for him to determine the relevance of the order. Burton suggests that Magruder cannot be reasonably blamed for his attacks on the Union line: he was responding to Lee's orders and did initially try to form a unified attack on the Union line. Finally, Magruder was riding back and forth across the battlefield, making it difficult for him to be found by junior officers seeking guidance. Several other factors may have played into the Confederate repulse, including Theophilus Holmes's refusal to participate in the battle, dismissing any notion of actively engaging the enemy. Lee's part in the Confederate defeat at Malvern Hill has been criticized by historians. Though he put rested troops on the field and accepted Longstreet's suggestions, which did not commit him to a charge, Lee himself was not present on the battlefield to observe the fighting. Historian Stephen Sears points out that Lee's ineffective communication with his generals and apparent failure to write his own communications to his brigadier generals (instead leaving orders open to interpretation) may have contributed to the defeat. Lee could also have countermanded Chilton's orders when it became apparent they were fruitless, or verified the \\"success\\" of Armistead. Consequently, Lee must also share blame in the repeated lack of coordination of attacks throughout the day.  Subsequent events  Map of the night march from Malvern Hill to Harrison's Landing; by Pvt. Robert K. Sneden of Brig. Gen. Heintzelman's III Corps. Union Army indicated in purple; Confederates or \\"Rebels\\" indicated in red. Despite the strength of Malvern Hill, as demonstrated in the battle, McClellan felt he needed to continue with his planned withdrawal to Harrison's Landing, to Fitz John Porter's chagrin. Porter felt the Army of the Potomac should remain atop the hill or perhaps even continue their advance to Richmond. McClellan however insisted that Confederate troops greatly outnumbered his own, felt he could not protect Harrison's Landing from his current position at Malvern Hill, and feared being cut off from his supply depot. McClellan's mentality prevailed. The Union batteries and McClellan's engineers began moving to Harrison's Landing soon after the end of the Battle of Malvern Hill. Starting at about 11p.m. unit after unit began to follow. Within hours, nearly all of McClellan's Army of the Potomac was marching towards Harrison's Landing. Once the last of these men had crossed the Turkey Island Bridge, they destroyed the bridge and felled trees over it to stymie any pursuit, leaving the James River between the Union and Confederate armies. The areas around Malvern Hill hosted much of Lee's army the night after the battle. Some of the Confederates were close enough to hear the sounds made by the Army of the Potomac retreating under cover of darkness, and see the lanterns of Northerners helping their wounded. The day after the Battle of Malvern Hill, Lee and Stonewall Jackson met President Jefferson Davis at Poindexter farm. They considered immediately pursuing McClellan; however, in view of the rain and confusion, Davis and Lee deemed large-scale pursuit of McClellan's army too risky. Jackson disagreed, saying, \\"They have not all got away if we go immediately after them.\\" Jackson even had the bodies of the dead moved so his soldiers had a clear line of attack when pursuing McClellan. However, Davis and Lee thought it necessary to rest the army. They did not completely rule out a pursuit though; Lee even ordered J. E. B. Stuart to reconnoiter McClellan's position for future attacks.; Lee ordered Theophilus Holmes to move to Drewry's Bluff, and decided to keep the men on Malvern Hill through July 3 to forestall any potential Union attack against that location. On July 4, 1862, Lee's men began marching towards Harrison's Landing. He made his headquarters a few miles north of Evelington Heights, a elevation approximately from Harrison's Landing, and stayed nearby with his army for several days, searching for weaknesses in the Union line at the heights that might allow for an attack. No weakness presented itself though, and by the end of July 8, the entire Army of Northern Virginia, save for cavalry stations and picket forces, was back near Richmond. The Peninsula Campaign was over.;  Reactions and effects  Despite the defeat on Malvern Hill, the Seven Days Battles accomplished the original Confederate goal of removing any direct threat to Richmond from the Union Army. The three newspapers in Richmond exulted in this strategic victory and lionized Robert E. Lee as a national hero: \\"No captain that ever lived,\\" opined the Richmond Dispatch, \\"could have planned or executed a better plan.\\" Similarly, Confederate Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory said, \\"the Great McClelland [sic] the young Napoleon now like a whipped cur lies on the banks of the James River crouched under his Gun Boats.\\" Throughout Richmond and the once-beleaguered South, there was a triumphant mood, and scant attention was paid to the flaws in Lee's tactics or execution. Lee was not exultant, but \\"deeply, bitterly disappointed\\" at the result. \\"Our success has not been as great or complete as we should have desired\\", Lee wrote to his wife. In his official report, he wrote, \\"Under ordinary circumstances, the Federal Army should have been destroyed.\\" The North Carolinian D. H. Hill shared Lee's bitterness, and wrote that the \\"blood of North Carolina poured like water\\". In a post-war article he wrote that the battle \\"was not war; it was murder.\\" Lee did not distribute blame for the failure to reach his desired result, but there were repercussions. Several commanders were reassigned, including Theophilus Holmes and John Magruder, and his army was reorganized into two wings, one under Stonewall Jackson and another under James Longstreet. Further, Confederate artillery would now be moved in battalion-sized units, at the head of Confederate columns. An 1864 newspaper cartoon of McClellan on the USS Galena, labelled \\"The Gunboat Candidate\\". McClellan was harshly criticized during his 1864 presidential campaign for his placement during the Battle of Malvern Hill. The dialogue box reads: \\"Fight on my brave Soldiers and push the enemy to the wall, from this spanker boom your beloved General looks down upon you.\\" In McClellan's case, his success on Malvern Hill was overshadowed by his overall defeat in the Seven Days Battles. The Northern public met McClellan's defeat with despondency, and his reputation was tarnished. Some of McClellan's soldiers voiced their continued confidence in him. Such opinions were not unanimous, however; one of McClellan's engineers, Lt. William Folwell, wondered why \\"they deify a General whose greatest feat has been a masterly retreat.\\" A similar opinion was shared by many others in the rank and file of the Union military. Some in politics also abandoned the Democratic McClellan. He was also accused of being on the Galena during the Battle of Malvern Hill, and newspapers and tabloids around the country heaped scorn on him for this, especially when he ran for president in 1864. President Lincoln was also losing faith in McClellan. On June26, the day of Lee's first offensive during the Seven Days, the Army of Virginia was formed and the command given to Maj. Gen. John Pope. While McClellan was at Harrison's Landing, parts of his Army of the Potomac were continuously reassigned to Pope. Pope and his Army of Virginia left for Gordonsville, Virginia on July 14, setting the stage for the subsequent Northern Virginia Campaign. In his Battle-Pieces publication, Herman Melville penned a poem about the battle, titled with the same name as the hill on which it was fought. In the poem, Melville questions the elms of Malvern Hill of whether they recall \\"the haggard beards of blood\\" the day of the battle.  Battlefield preservation  The battlefield at Malvern Hill is credited by the National Park Service as being \\"the best preserved Civil War battlefield in central or southern Virginia\\". Most recent preservation efforts there have been the consequence of cooperative efforts between Richmond National Battlefield Park and the Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust. The Trust has acquired and preserved of the battlefield in more than six transactions since 1994. American Battlefield Trust \\"Saved Land\\" webpage. Accessed May 30, 2018. Its efforts have been bolstered by the Virginia Land Conservation Fund, the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, and officials from Henrico County. Most of this tract wraps around the intersection of Willis Church Road and Carter's Mill Road. The land includes the starting point for the Confederate assaults on the day of the battle, the Willis Church Parsonage, the ruins of which remain visible today. Recent preservation efforts include the acquisition of the Crew house in 2013. As of 2005, the National Park Service reported that of land was protected on and around Malvern Hill to preserve the battlefield. (More land has been acquired and preserved since then by the American Battlefield Trust as per citation 114). Driving and walking tours, among other services, are offered at the site. In August 2016, the 871-acre Malvern Hill Farm was listed for sale for $10.6 million by the descendants of William H. Ferguson Sr. (1885‚Äì1984). It was purchased by the non-profit Capital Region Land Conservancy (CRLC) in February 2018 for $6.6 million. CRLC subsequently recorded conservation easements to protect 465 acres with the Virginia Department of Historic Resources and 25 acres with the Virginia Outdoors Foundation. Portions of the property were then gifted to Henrico County for the future site of an open space area for education and passive recreation as well as the James River Association for a canoe and kayak launch into Turkey Island Creek, which flows into the James River at Presquile National Wildlife Refuge. Capital Region Land Conservancy is holding the remaining 380 acres to be included into the National Park Service Richmond National Battlefield Park.

He was known as the \\"Red Bishop of Beirut\\" promoting a secular \\"social movement\\" and a platform of rapprochement between Muslims and Christians with the onslaught of the Lebanese Civil War. He reinforced his controversial viewpoints through further secular movements and through Afaq magazine, which he founded. In 1975 under pressure from the Holy See, he resigned from active religious duty. Since his resignation, he became an emeritus archbishop without holding an actual diocese in Lebanon. Life Gr√©goire Haddad (in Arabic ÿ∫ÿ±Ÿäÿ∫Ÿàÿßÿ± ÿ≠ÿØŸëÿßÿØ) was born as Nakhle Amine Haddad (ŸÜÿÆŸÑÿ© ÿ£ŸÖŸäŸÜ ÿ≠ÿØÿßÿØ) in Souk El Gharb, a small town in Lebanon. His father Amine Nakhle Haddad was a Protestant Christian and his mother Mathilde Nawfal belonged to the Melkite Greek Catholic Church. He attended elementary school in Souk el Gharb High School from 1934 to 1936, after which he spent a year in a Basilian secondary school. By 1943 he was in a school of the Eastern Churches taught by Jesuits and ended his high school. Haddad began the study of philosophy and theology, and in 1949 was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Philippe Nabaa, his predecessor in the Episcopate of Beirut (1948-1967). He then worked as a secretary in the Archbishop's Ordinariate in Beirut and devoted himself to several social projects, and founded the Lebanese social movement. On 30 July 1965, with an appointment would come Bishop in Beirut and Byblos and titular bishop of Palmyra of Greek Melkites. On 5 September 1965 he was ordained to the episcopate by Maximos IV Sayegh, SMSP (Archbishop of Beirut and Byblos from 1933 to 1947) and his co- consecrators were Archbishop Philippe Nabaa (Archbishop of Beirut and Byblos 1948-1967) and Archbishop Joseph Tawil (Archbishop of the Eparchy of Newton). In this role, Haddad also participated in the fourth session of the Second Vatican Council in part. After the death of the archbishop, he led the Diocese of Beirut and was appointed on 9 September 1968 to the Melkite Archbishopric of Beirut and Byblos. He was a consecrator of the Archbishops Elias Nijm√©, BA (Archbishop of the Archeparchy of Tripoli) and Jean Assaad Haddad (Archbishop of Tyre). In the first years of his term, the new archbishop had many decisions of the Second Vatican Council to implement. This included the new situation for the participation of the laity. His active contacts with the Shiite Imam Musa al-Sadr, the founder of the Shiite Amal movement and his commitment to work with political and lay (non-religious) conditions, led to warnings from the Vatican. Together Haddad and al-Sadr founded in 1960 the Social Movement\\" (in Arabic ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßÿ¨ÿ™ŸÖÿßÿπŸäÿ©) and promoted in the following years, the Islamic-Christian dialogue. Following that, Musa al-Sadr held a speech during Easter in a Capuchin church. Haddad also founded in the 1960s a number of other auxiliary movements to his Social Movement including Self Education (ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ´ŸÇŸäŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿ∞ÿßÿ™Ÿä), the Ecumenical Movement for Youth (ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ŸÉŸàŸÜŸäÿ© ŸÑŸÑÿ¥ÿ®Ÿäÿ®ÿ©), the inter-scholar United Club (ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿØŸä ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿ≠ŸëÿØ), Oasis of Hope (Ÿàÿßÿ≠ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ¨ÿßÿ°) to work with the grassroots Social Movement. In addition, Gr√©goire Haddad was active in publishing articles and giving media interviews about his theory about a rapprochement between socialism and the Church saying he represented increasing public opinion on more secularization. In 1974-1975, he founded the periodical Afaq (in Arabic ÿ¢ŸÅÿßŸÇ meaning horizons) in which he elaborated his views. This put him in further conflict with his religious critics, the Greek Catholic Patriarch and the Greek Catholic Holy Synodus and eventually with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that examined his controversial viewpoints without finding evidence of deviation from church doctrine but leaving the final decision about him to the ruling Patriarch and Holy Synodus. His writings and speeches led to more escalated and heated debates in the media. His objective was to attempt to promote a peaceful religion in touch with laity.[Peace pin end religions? Religion and the de- escalation of political conflicts, Ed. Manfred Brocker, Mathias Hildebrandt, 1st edition 2008, VS Verlag f√ºr Social Sciences, ] As political pressure mounted on him, followed by threat of sanctions within the Greek Catholic Church eventually leading Gr√©goire Haddad to resign from his post as Archbishop of Beirut and Byblos on 19 September 1975. Pope Paul VI in a concurrent appointment gave him the Titular title as Archbishop of Adana of Greek Catholic Melkites (Turkey) with no actual congregation to tend to. After his resignation he retired to a monastery, and refused any further bishop offices offered to him within the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, except for a brief period as temporary replacement to the deceased Greek Catholic Bishop of Tyre in 1986-1987. Gr√©goire Haddad spent most of his remaining time in seclusion Faraya, Laqlouq, Akoura (1992-1997) and in the Patriarchate in Rabweh, preferring to continue promote social movements in Lebanon without implicating his Church further, preferring to work under his personal title. In the year 2000, he established along with a secular elite Civil Society Movement (in Arabic ÿ™Ÿäÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¨ÿ™ŸÖÿπ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸÜŸä) with clear political, social and secular reformist agenda.

Enjoying a brilliant official career, Qian rose to the rank of vice-president of the Board of Works.

In over twenty years' service at court, Qian Weicheng produced more than 275 paintings for the emperor. Even after Qian's death in 1772, the emperor continued, as on this album, to add appreciative inscriptions. Life Qian Weicheng (style name Zongpan, sobriquet You‚Äôan), a native of Changzhou, Jiangsu, came in first place in the civil service exams of 1745. In painting, he looked back to the Four Yuan Masters and more recently in his day to the Four Wangs of the Qing. Receiving instruction from Dong Bangda, he also entered the Southern Studio at court. Works This album originally formed part of a four-volume set depicting scenery and flowers of the four seasons. Representing the varied faces of winter, the twelve paintings in the album alternate between the soft grays and muted colors of wintry landscapes and the intense colors of seasonal flowers. This work illustrates a poem by the Qianlong Emperor. With meticulous brushwork, it depicts the imperial bodyguard pushing and pulling a yellow ice-sled tent on which Qianlong rides, slowly making their way across the Taiye Lake of the Western Gardens.

It was, at various times, the official organ of several successive political movements: the Patrons of Industry, the Farmers Association of Ontario, and the United Farmers of Ontario, and supporting the idea of a progressive farmers' political party. History The newspaper was founded in London, Ontario in May 1892 by George Weston Wrigley, a long time publisher of labour newspapers. The paper supporting the Ontario Patrons of Industry, a rapidly growing agrarian reform movement. The Patrons were not a political party, but had political goals. They wanted a smaller and simpler government, abolition of railway subsidies and reduced reciprocal tariffs. They also wanted laws against cartels and monopolies. In 1893 Wrigley agreed to devote three pages of his paper to the Patrons in return for their financial assistance. The publication described itself as ‚Äúthe official organ of the Patrons of Industry of Ontario and Quebec.‚Äù In May 1894 the paper moved to offices in the Evening Star building in Toronto. In 1895 the Patrons bought a 50% share of the paper, which claimed to have a circulation of 30,000. The paper gave extensive coverage to the Patrons, but also covered many other reform movements and proposals. It avoided religious controversy, but clearly took the Social Gospel position that the value of Christianity lay in practical deeds. In 1895-96 Wrigley published a paper named Brotherhood Era, which he also inserted as a supplement in the Sun. It was aimed at urban readers, and concentrated on the injustice of industrial capitalism, supporting causes such as the single tax, the eight-hour day and equal suffrage, and opposing militarism. By April 1896 the Sun was in financial difficulties, with declining circulation. Wrigley was replaced as editor by Goldwin Smith. In the 1896 Federal elections internal dissensions appeared among the Patrons, who only won three seats. With the decline of the party, the newspaper was sold to Goldwin Smith. Where Wrigley had used the paper to try to promote an alliance between farmers and labour, Smith aimed to turn the newspaper into \\"the voice of rural Ontario.\\" He ceased publication of a supplement, The Brotherhood Era, aimed at industrial workers and expanded the Sun to a ten-page publication with the slogan ‚ÄúAn Independent Journal For Farm and Home.‚Äù The newspaper, now called The Weekly Sun, supported agrarianism and free trade and acted as the organ of the Farmers Association of Ontario until that organization dissolved in 1907. The newspaper had a circulation of 16,000 in 1909. Smith died in 1910 and the newspaper soon became the unofficial organ of the United Farmers of Ontario after its founding in 1914. In 1919, the newspaper's board of directors agreed to sell the Sun to the UFO which published it under its publication wing, the Farmer's Publishing Company, and renamed the newspaper The Farmer's Sun, \\"the Official Organ of the United Farmers of Ontario.\\" The paper soon increased its publication schedule to twice weekly. Around this time, Agnes Macphail began contributing writing to the Sun, including reminiscences about life in rural Ontario. With the fragmentation of the UFO in 1922, during a crisis of the UFO-led provincial government in Ontario under Ernest C. Drury, circulation fell grew more conservative. Following the dissolution of a brief political alliance between the UFO and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation of Ontario in 1934, the paper was sold to Graham Spry and Alan Plaunt who renamed it New Commonwealth and operated it as the organ of the League for Social Reconstruction and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section). Aftermath In 1936, the UFO launched the Rural Co-operator as its new organ and to continue the tradition of the Sun. The newspaper, which was published twice a month, subsequently became the organ of the UFO's successor, the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. Rural Co-operator changed its name to Farm & Country in the 1960s and would continue publishing as a twice monthly tabloid until 1997 and then a glossy magazine until 1999 when the OFA's publishing arm, the Agricultural Publishing Company Ltd., went into receivership. A number of the magazine's former writers went on to found Better Farming magazine.

He is most noted for his contributions to the development of naval wargaming at the United States Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Biography Little, on the cover of Naval War College Review (March 1972) William McCarty Little (often referred to as \\"McCarty Little\\") was born in New York City on 6 September 1845 and entered the United States Naval Academy on 11 March 1863. For the duration of the American Civil War the Naval Academy had been relocated to Newport, Rhode Island, where Little and his wealthy parents had become accustomed to spending their summers. While at the academy, he met Lieutenant (later Rear Admiral) Stephen B. Luce who was to have a great influence in Little's life. Luce regarded Newport's Narragansett Bay as uniquely suitable for naval training, and with Little campaigned to have the Naval Academy remain there after the civil war. Little was, apparently, a very bright student as he was allowed to graduate from the Academy in June 1866 after only three of the usual four years of study. After graduation, he served on the USS Macedonian, USS Saco and the famous sail racing yacht America‚Äîwhich was being used as a training ship by the Academy. He was granted three months leave in Europe and, in 1867, reported for duty on the USS Colorado, the flagship of the European Squadron. Little was commissioned as an ensign on 12 March 1868 and was assigned as a flag lieutenant (aide) to Commodore Pennock, the commander of the European Squadron. He was promoted to the rank of master on 26 March 1869 and assigned to the USS Franklin. He was then promoted to lieutenant on 29 March 1870.U.S. Navy Register of Commissioned Officers. 1896. pg. 78. Anita Chartrand Little by Jane Stuart In 1871 Little was detached from the Franklin to begin an eight-month study leave in Europe. It was probably during this time he became acquainted with the German Kriegspiel (war game) which was used to train officers of the German Army in tactics. In 1872 he returned to the United States to become an instructor at the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, where he married Anita Chartrand, who was the daughter of a socially prominent Cuban family and a belle of Newport's summer colony. In 1878 Little was assigned as navigator on the training ship USS Minnesota under Captain Stephen B. Luce. In 1881 Luce was promoted to commodore and Little was assigned as executive officer of Luce's flagship, the venerable ship-of-the-line USS New Hampshire. Little had lost the sight in one eye in a shooting accident ashore in 1876, and strained his remaining eye preparing nautical charts in insufficient light while serving as navigation officer aboard . There was danger of complete blindness, and he was involuntarily retired from the Navy on 16 May 1884 for \\"incapacity as a result of an incident in the service\\".U.S. Navy Register of Commissioned Officers. 1905. pg. 129 Despite being retired, he volunteered to serve on the staff of the newly established United States Naval War College of which Stephen B. Luce was the first president. Little had helped Luce establish the College at Newport, and worked with Luce's replacement, Alfred Thayer Mahan, to keep the College operational. Under Mahan's direction, Little introduced naval war gaming at the college in a lecture he gave in 1886. The war games, typically using models of ships on a flat surface representing the ocean, were a useful tool for preparing officers attending the college to command squadrons and fleets of ships later in their careers. They were also useful in developing tactics which could be useful in future conflicts. Little is credited with adapting the naval version of Army war games being used by his friend, Major W.R. Livermore, who was stationed at Fort Adams near the War College. The War College and Fort Adams conducted joint training maneuvers in 1887 with Fort Adams defending against a simulated night torpedo attack on harbor shipping in October, and a simulated amphibious invasion of Newport in November. Little persuaded Mahan to publish his classic The Influence of Sea Power upon History in 1890. He then translated French, Italian, Spanish, and German publications for the War College library while the College was temporarily closed for construction of improved buildings from 1890 until 1892. Little was appointed as the commander of the Rhode Island Naval Militia in 1896 and returned to active duty during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. During the war he served as the executive officer of the Naval Training Station in Newport. After the war he resumed his duties at the Naval War College. In recognition of his valuable contributions, by a special act of Congress, Little was promoted to the rank of captain on the retired list on 21 February 1903 and made a permanent faculty member at the Naval War College. In 1912 his lecture \\"The Strategic Naval War Game Or Chart Maneuver\\" was published by the United States Naval Institute.\\"The Strategic Naval War Game Or Chart Maneuver\\" Captain Little was a member of the Naval Order of the United States. Captain Little retired from the Naval War College in January 1915 and died at his home in Newport on 12 March 1915. He was buried at St. Mary's Episcopal Cemetery in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Admiral Luce died two years later; and was interred in an adjacent grave. Mahan had died a year before, after publicly recognizing McCarty Little's essential role in maintaining the Naval War College's continuity of purpose through the difficult early years. Admiral William Sims said: \\"...so long as we have a Naval War College, his name must always remain intimately associated with its best traditions.\\" Family Little was the father of Major General Louis McCarty Little, USMC who was the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps. General Little served in the Philippine Insurrection, World War I and World War II. Legacy McCarty Little Hall at the Naval War College is named in honor of Captain William McCarty Little. It is the college's war gaming center. In reference to value of naval war gaming at the Naval War College Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz said that as a result of the war gaming nothing happened during the war in the Pacific, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, which was a surprise.

It is one of the important churches and pilgrim centers in the region, in communion with the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.  History  People from many parts of Travancore-Cochin region started to settle at Kallody as early as 1942 onward. The geography of the place with hills, fields, rivers, streams, fertile land and a comparably increased security from wild animals attracted people to settle here. Many of the early settlers from Travancore region belonged to Syrian Catholics and other Christians whom the natives welcomed wholeheartedly. Until 1943 Immaculate Conception Church, Mananthavady was the only spiritual refuge of the Christian community of Kallody. Not so late, parishioners from some sixteen families spent some money, bought a piece of land and started building a small construction. In 1943 April 23, the statue of St. George was installed and Rev. Fr. Alosius Di Silva celebrated the first holy Mass. In 1948 the former construction was changed and a modified construction for the church was built. From 1949 onward Rev. Fr. C.J Varky started celebrating the Holy Mass here. In 1951 August 25 Bishop of Calicut Rev. Patroni made Kallody parish an independent parish from under the administration of the Immaculate Conception Church, Mananthavady. He appointed Rev. Fr. Thomas Kalam SJ as the vicar of the parish. Until 1953 Kallody parish was under the administration of Diocese of Calicut. When the Diocese of Tellicherry, as part of Syro-Malabar Catholic Church was formed in 1953, the parish came under the administration of the Diocese of Tellicherry and the first bishop of the diocese, Mar. Sebastian Valloppilly. Church on a misty day. Until April 1954 when Rev. Fr. Sebastian Ilamthuruthi took charge of the parish, the parish had been led by Latin priests. Fewer number of priests from the host diocese forced Bishop Sebastian Valloppilly to appoint priests from Carmelite congregation. During this period Kallody parish had grown both spiritually and physically well with the help of the Rev. priests. The parish has no history excluding the helps of the reverend priests from the Diocese of Calicut and from the CMI Church. Their efforts were seminal in the development of the parish. The church and the place got its present wealth, roads, means of transportation and primary education facilities through the hands of these reverend priests. After the formation of Diocese of Mananthavady, bifurcating the Diocese of Tellicherry in 1973 May 1, the parish continued its developments under the new diocese and the guidance of its bishop Jacob Thoomkuzhy. Though the church is named after St. George, from 1958 onward, in the Centenary of Mary of Lourde's, the main feast of the church became Mary of Lourde's. After 1968 priests from Diocese of Tellicherry and Mananthavady serve the parish. During this period the parish witnessed immeasurable growth. In the field of agriculture, new farming techniques were tested. In the educational sector High School and Higher Secondary Schools were established and in the cultural sector a Reading-House was set. In the recent past, the forane of Dwaraka was formed bifurcating the forane of Kallody. The construction works for the new church is underway. As part of it the forane office cum rectory was blessed on 8 June 2019 by bishop of diocese of Mananthavady, Mar. Jose Porunnedom. Today, the church continues her growth with the helps of the reverend priests and the laymen. She intervenes in the cultural sphere of the place whenever time finds it necessary.

Biography Louis Edmund Blaze (born 29 September 1861 in Kandy) was the fifth child and fourth son of Louis Ezekiel Blaze (1827‚Äì1894), a coffee merchant, and Henrietta Charlotte n√©e Garnier (1833‚Äì1899). His grand parents, John Henry Blaze and Margareta Caroline n√©e de Joodt, were headmaster and headmistress of schools in Paiyagala in the Kalutara District. His eldest brother, John Thomas (1853‚Äì1921), studied at Lincoln College, Oxford, was admitted to the bar in June 1877 and became a lecturer in law and editor of the newspaper, Ceylon Examiner. One of his other brothers, Robert Ezekiel (1863‚Äì1916), was the crown proctor of Badulla. Early studies Blaze was one of the first group of students to study at Trinity College, Kandy (then known as the Trinity College and Collegiate School), at the time of the founding of the school by Rev. Richard Collins for the Church Mission Society in 1872. Whilst at Trinity he produced a school magazine, which appeared in manuscript form, on 15 May 1876, and later issued fortnightly as The Gleaner. In 1880 at age nineteen he passed the first examination in Arts at the University of Calcutta, following which he took up an appointment as the head master of the lower school at Trinity College. Uncertain as to whether his career lay in education he resigned a month later to become a law student however he was more interested in literature and cultivated a talent for writing poetry. In December 1882 he returned to Calcutta completing his Bachelor of Arts examination at the University. Between 1883 and 1890 Blaze taught for nearly two years in Calcutta, first at the Bishop‚Äôs College and then at St. James' School. After that he served as a second master and as acting head master at the Boys High School in Lahore. In these years, he read numerous works and found inspiration in the life and works of Dr. Thomas Arnold (1795‚Äì1842) the headmaster of Rugby School. In this respect he wrote, \\"Anecdotes of Eaton, Harrow and Winchester which I eagerly read and remembered revealed much and their school songs stirred me deeply, as indeed they stir all youthful souls\\". Then he thought of founding a public school by himself, writing \\"What disturbed me in Ceylon schools and in all other schools known to me were the strange distance between Teacher and Pupil and the needlessly hostile relations that existed between them. Another thing that I specially disliked was the craze for judging the merits of a school by the examination results.\\" He returned to Ceylon in January 1891. Kingswood College On 4 May 1891 Blaze opened 'The Boys High School' on Pavilion Street in the centre of Kandy, with eleven pupils. Blaze modelled the school on the traditional English Public School system, even naming the four houses at the school: Eton; Harrow; Winchester and Rugby. As the school did not qualify for government assistance, Blaze had to hand over the struggling institution to the Methodist Mission in July 1894. Blaze was responsible for introducing rugby to schools in Ceylon, having learnt the game and the rules whilst he was teaching in India, he started coaching his pupils in the sport from the year the school was established. The first ever inter-school match in Ceylon was held on 11 August 1906 between Kingswood and Trinity at the Bogambara Grounds, which ended in a six-all draw. On 12 January 1898, Blaze moved the school to Brownrigg Street, where the school was renamed, Kingswood Public School. In 1900 he wrote a textbook, History of Ceylon, the first comprehensive school textbook on the history of Sri Lanka and the prescribed history textbook for Junior High School until the late 1930s (with ten editions being published in that time). In 1902 the school had the distinction of appointing the first lady teacher to the staff of a Boys School in the country. On 30 September 1904 he established the Kingswood Union, the association for old boys at the college, for which he unanimously elected as president. In 1914 he authored The Story of Lanka, another detailed history of the island, which became the Middle School school text for history (it was re- printed six times). During the first sixty years of the institution, the school eventually became one of the most prominent Public Schools in Kandy. Before his retirement he planned the removal of the school from the small premises it occupied in Brownrigg Street relocating it, in 1925, to the village of Wel-Ata in Mulgampola, then a quiet suburb of Kandy. Blaze retired from the principalship of the school on 31 December 1923, after serving in that position for thirty years. Retirement Upon his retirement Blaze left Kandy and settled in Colombo, where he accepted the role as the editor of The Ceylon Independent, the workload however proved to be too great and he was offered several educational appointments and accepted for a short period the position as principal of the Prince of Wales' College, Moratuwa. For many years he was the president of the English Association, as well as being an active member of Historical Association, the Royal Asiatic Society and the Ceylon Geographical Society, who honoured him by electing him a life member. In 1934 he authored Kingswood For Ever, The Story of Kingswood, Kandy, a historical account of the school that he founded. This was followed in 1936 by a book of verse, In Praise of Ceylon. Personal On 16 December 1891 he married Alice Maud n√©e Avery (8 March 1865 ‚Äì 1 March 1912) in Negombo. They had three daughters: Irene Clarice (who died 16 August 1893); Alice 'Ray' Rachel; and Marie Louise (who died 9 November 1917). The couple's only surviving daughter, Ray, became a journalist and played a prominent role in the early years of the Girl Guides Association. Following his retirement he was made a Justice of the Peace for the Kandy district. In 1929 he received the Order of the British Empire. Blaze died on 4 August 1951, a few days after he had helped Kingswood College celebrate its Diamond Jubilee.

In the Upanishads this term is used to indicate the self-willed manifestation of Brahman under visible and nameable aspects, to the said manifestation into the fictitious plurality of the phenomenal world owing to maya, the unreal adjunct. According to Hindu scriptures the world in each age emanates from Brahman mirrored upon maya. The sage of the Chandogya Upanishad regarded the creation of the universe as a huge chest/egg from a Primeval Being existing as the undifferentiated whole, who alone existed without a second prior to the commencement of the process of creation which was the beginning of the differentiation of the undifferentiated. \\"The Primeval Being reflected, let me be many, let me produce; having bethought, thus to itself, it produced fire which produced water and from water was produced the Earth (food or matter)\\" (Chandogya Upanishad VI.ii.1-4). The doctrine of Trivritkarana, the prototype of the doctrine of Panchikarana that tells us how matter came unto existence originating from the primordial five subtle elements , belongs to this Upanishad. From the subtle elements were produced all gross elements, and all matter having names and forms that makes-up the entire universe. Adhikarana Saravali of Sri Vedanta Desika (Sloka IX.21-22) explains that the evolution of names and forms is the work of the Universal Self and not of the Individual self. All creation, and actions which produce results are willed and bestowed by God. However, Badarayana refutes the views held by the Mimamsakas that all results are produced by virtuous deeds alone, he states:- :‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§§‡•Å ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶‡§∞‡§æ‡§Ø‡§£‡•ã ‡§π‡•á‡§§‡•Å‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§™‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡§æ‡§§‡•ç :\\"But Badarayana considers the earlier One (as the bestower of results), because He is mentioned as the cause of even action.\\" Brahma Sutras (III.ii.41) In this context citing Bhagavada Gita (Sloka VII.21-22), Shankara clarifies that (quote) \\"in all the Upanishads creations are declared as the acts of Ishvara (God) (who is Brahman) whose bestowing of results consists precisely in His creating the creatures according to individual merits\\" (quote). He also cites Mundaka Upanishad which declares that from Brahman originates Prana etc., (II.i.3) and this world is nothing but Brahman (II.ii.11), he had earlier in his Bhasya explained that Brahman is the origin of all things and thought, Brahman becomes manifested through names and forms in several stages and related by being the material causes and products; implied that namarupa works as catalyst that spontaneously produces the multifaceted world commonly experienced by all living beings.

Life He was the son of the Zurich pastor Gotthard Schmid (1909-1968). He studied theology at the Universities of Zurich and G√∂ttingen and received his doctorate in 1965 in Zurich. In the winter semester 1966/67 he was habilitated in Zurich and a year later was appointed as an Assistant Professor. In 1969, Schmid was made Associate Professor of Old Testament studies. In 1972, he became the Rector of Bethel Theological Seminary (Kirchlichen Hochschule Bethel). In the summer semester 1976 he was Professor of Old Testament scholarship and general history of religion at the University of Zurich. From 1988 to 2000 he served as rector of the University of Zurich. During his tenure, in 1998, the University of Zurich became an independent legal entity of the Canton of Zurich. Hans Heinrich Schmid was married in 1962 and had two sons and two daughters. Scholarship Schmid was a respected authority on the question of Pentateuchal origins (the question of how the first five books of the bible ‚Äì Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Book of Numbers and Deuteronomy ‚Äì came to be written). His book Der sogenannte Jahwist (The So-called Yahwist, 1976) appeared at about the same time as two other important works, John Van Seters' Abraham in History and Tradition (1975),Abraham in History and Tradition, by John Van Seters, Yale University Press, , 1975 and Rolf Rendtorff's \\"Das √ºberlieferungsgeschichtliche Problem des Pentateuch\\" (The Problem of the Transmission of the Pentateuch, 1977).Das √ºberlieferungsgeschichtliche Problem des Pentateuch, by Rolf Rendtorff. Translated by John J. Scullion: The problem of the process of transmission in the Pentateuch. These three studies inaugurated a heated discussion in scholarly circles on the validity of the then-dominant consensus on Pentateuchal origins, the Documentary Hypothesis. Thus, Schmid significantly contributed to the advancement of the Supplementary hypothesis of Pentateuch composition. According to Schmid, both the J material and the P material were products of the Babylonian exile period (6th century BC) and were directly derived from Babylonian sources (see also Panbabylonism).Hans Heinrich Schmid, The So-Called Yahwist (1976) discussed in Antony F.

Four men ‚Äì a senator, cabinet official, banker and Washington, D.C. lobbyist ‚Äì have died suddenly apparently of natural causes. All the men own substantial shares in the same Middle East oil and munitions companies. David Hawk, chief of secret US intelligence agency AXE, is suspicious. Nick Carter, agent N3, goes undercover as oil executive Jerry Deming. He joins the same high-level social circuit as the dead men offering himself as bait. As he returns home one evening in the company of Ruth Moto he is attacked and his home robbed by a gang of armed men (Hans Geist, Sammy, Chick Soong and an unnamed man). AXE has identified six Asian women, including Ruth Moto, who have attended a variety of social functions with the dead men. Carter targets the women at his next function - an exclusive party at the secluded Lord estate in Pennsylvania where he poses as Alastair Williams, an executive from Vickers. Carter discovers that the six Asian women are part of a high-class call girl group collaborating with the Baumann Group (possibly led by Carter's arch-enemy, Judas) and Chinese communists. After a firefight with armed staff at the estate, Carter escapes with one of the girls (Jeanyee Ahling). He tricks her into boarding a private plane and flying back to Washington, D.C. under AXE protection. Carter attempts to interrogate her on the plane but is largely unsuccessful. As Carter feigns sleep Jeanyee places a thin plastic hood over his face that releases a poison gas ‚Äì the method used to kill the four high-profile victims. Carter holds his breath and Jeanyee removes the mask thinking Carter has died. Carter confronts Jeanyee but she jumps to her death from the plane. Carter resumes his social activities as Jerry Deming. Eventually, he meets Sonya Ranyez ‚Äì another of the six call girls. AXE traces a lead to Baltimore. Carter checks out a large Chinese restaurant on the coast, which has its own small marina. Staking it out at night he boards a cruiser taking Sonya and the remaining girls and the gang members out to sea. The cruiser meets up with a schooner in the Magothy River. A meeting takes place with Hans Geist, Sammy, Chick Soong ‚Äì apparently a middleman acting for communist China ‚Äì and a heavily bandaged man who may be Judas/Martin Bormann. It becomes clear that China is seducing / pressuring prominent US business leaders to supply crude oil. If they fail to comply they are murdered using the Hood of Death. Carter, still posing as Jerry Deming, sets up a meeting with Ruth's father, Akito Moto in search of a job as an oil broker. Akito agrees to meet him. Carter confronts Akito in his office. Akito recognizes Carter as the man who caused disruption at the Lord estate party. Soong bursts in and Carter shoots him and Akito. Geist and Sammy are killed later. Ruth kills herself rather than be arrested.

Biography Kanoa was born around the year 1802 in Kahaluu in South Kona on the island of Hawaii. His parents were Kapuohoula and Kepaa. His family descended from the Molokai chiefess Kane ªalai. Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa, the father of Kamehameha IV and Kamehameha V, and Boaz Mahune, the author of the Hawaiian Declaration of Rights of 1839, were his cousins. In his youth, Kanoa lived for a time with Gerrit P. Judd, an American missionary and advisor to King Kamehameha III, and also accompanied Rev. Hiram Bingham I on two missionary trips to Kaua ªi. He started his political career as a secretary of his cousin Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa, the Governor of O ªahu. In 1842, Kanoa was elected along with L. K. Hala ªi as O ªahu's representative to Legislature of Hawaii at Lahaina, the capital at the time. Kanoa served as a clerk in the 1842 session of the legislature. In 1845, he was appointed an official member of the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature. In order to replace the diminishing number of ali ªi nui, it was decided on April 2, 1845, to vote lower-ranking chiefs who were \\"men of learning\\" into the council and elevate their chiefly statuses. Kanoa was among the first group of six lesser chiefs chosen. He also served as a member of the Privy Council from October 21, 1846, to February 23, 1874. In 1847, Paul Kanoa was appointed to succeed Princess Kekau ª≈çnohi as the Royal Governor of Kaua ªi, a position he held until his resignation on January 4, 1877. Unlike his predecessors who ruled like conquerors, his rule, although firm, was characterized by cooperation with the resurgent native chiefs of Kaua ªi. During this period, the sugar industry became the dominant enterprise on the island and businessmen such as Paul Isenberg and William Hyde Rice profited from close affiliation with Governor Kanoa. In his long political career, Kanoa served under the reigns of five monarchs: Kamehameha III, Kamehameha IV and Kamehameha V, Lunalilo and KalƒÅkaua. Death and legacy Paul Kanoa died at the age of 83, on November 10, 1885, after falling from a second-storey room, in his Honolulu residence. After a state funeral on November 15, he was buried in a family vault at the cemetery of Kawaiaha ªo Church. He was survived by his widow Kahanaauwai, hƒÅnai son Paul P. Kanoa, who was also Governor of Kaua ªi from 1881 to 1886, and his only daughter Deborah Maunakilika Kanoa, who became his sole heir. Owning extensive lands on Kaua ªi extending from Koloa to Hanamaulu, he built a home on the hills overlooking the beach of Nawiliwili Bay, around the present day Niumalu Beach Park. It later was converted into a courthouse and county offices and became the Kauai High School around 1914. In 1931, historian Ethel Moseley Damon wrote about Governor Kanoa: > Governor Kanoa was one of the outstanding figures in Kauai society... A > commanding figure physically, with a strong yet responsive face, and a > shrewd though genial expression, Paul Kanoa was also a commanding figure in > his sturdy uprightness and his unswerving devotion to duty and honor as he > understood them.

Initially adhering to the movement of Art Nouveau sans phrase, Herrfeldt later integrates elements of New Objectivity. Fusing Art Nouveau and elements of New Objectivity, he develops a style referred to as http://www.kettererkunst.de/lexikon/expressiver-realismus.shtml expressive realism in respective literature.  Biography  Marcel Ren√© von Herrfeldt was born in 1889, in Paris of the Fin de Si√®cle. His parents, Alice Herrfeldt and Luis Ricardo Falero, are both artists and engaged to the bustling art scene of Paris and Europe. Since a very young age, painting is a preoccupation of Herrfeldt. He mainly studies in Munich, guided by Franz von Stuck, Florence and Paris, with an interruption during the First World War. Herrfeldt's paintings are strongly influenced by his teacher Franz von Stuck; in an early phase, he is both influenced by motives and genre, later on, he develops a more individual style, integrating realistic, expressionist elements.Ludwig, Horst (1989):¬´Im Fahrwasser der Sezession¬ª, in: Franz von Stuck und seine Sch√ºler, M√ºnchen: Dr. C. Wolf und Sohn KG, p. 213. The motives Herrfeldt does not only share with other protagonists of the Munich School, but with his father as well. The focus on nude paintings and especially women portrayals is relatively widespread in that art scene. Although Herrfeldt's biography is not entirely reconstructed, there is an uncontested hallmark in his early career: 1921 he exhibitions his interpretation of the subjection of woman/woman slavery at Glaspalast, at an annual exhibition organized by protagonists of the Munich School, well renowned by that time.

Experts primarily differentiate between an early MRH phase of pure Art Nouveau and a later phase of an Expressionist Realistic turn.Zeller, Klaus Robert (2000): Marcel Ren√© von Herrfeldt. Die Sammlung MRH, Z√ºrich, p.12, www.artocratia.ch By contrast, there is continuity regarding his motives of astrology and mythology.  Oeuvre   Inspiration  Regarding motives, several influences can be highlighted. One of the most important: His father Luis Ricardo Falero (Im. 2) ‚Äì a Spanish painter and engineer ‚Äì who is as well focused on nude-painting, astrology and mythology.Zeller, Klaus Robert (2000): Marcel Ren√© von Herrfeldt. Die Sammlung MRH, Z√ºrich, p.7, www.artocratia.ch The focus on women portrayals and mythological motives Herrfeldt shared with his contemporaries and relative art movements such as the Vienna Secession, with well renowned representatives such as Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele. Le vin de Tokai, by Luis Ricardo Falero - 2.jpg|Im.1 Wine of Tokai, Falero  Principal work and Motives  Exploring the treasury chest of antique mythology, his preoccupation with nude painting and women portrayals are accompanied with Max Drost's dictum that Herrfeldt is the herald of women's beauty.Drostt, Max (1925): ¬´Marcel Herrfeldt. Ein Verk√ºnder der Sch√∂nheit¬ª, in: Die Sch√∂nheit, 8 (1925), Dresden: Verlag der Sch√∂nheit, S. 358‚Äì369. His affinity to antique Mythology is pivotal and explicit in his masterpiece Poseidon, completed in 1960, a phase Herrfeldt himself refers to as his peak. Herrfeldt only dates this piece of art. Herrfeldt's masterpiece is created by a time when the Age of Aquarius is of special interest. Moreover, Herrfeldt not only portrays women, but men as well. His interpretation of Narciss is a typical example. The interpretations of Salome, Judith and the slave women, the latter caughting huge attention when exhibited in 1921 in the Glaspalast, are key paintings as well. Further topics are his extensive studies of water, music and dancing scenes. The portrayals of women and focus on power relations and subjection runs like a golden thread through his creations. These portrayals are expressive, idealized and provocative, especially in the context of the 1920s.  Impact  Despite of his absence in current debates, Herrfeldt can be related to modern Pinup culture.Zeller, Klaus Robert (2000): Marcel Ren√© von Herrfeldt. Die Sammlung MRH, Z√ºrich, p.25, www.artocratia.ch In addition, the tension of erotic, idealized portrayals and emancipation is not a controversy limited to his epoch, but steadily reappears and recently becomes manifest in the context of the Femen Movement.

It was written by Jessica Sharzer and directed by Loni Peristere.  Plot  The Freaks hold a feast to welcome Chester as the new owner of the freak show, but after Elsa asks him to leave her and the troupe alone, she reveals their true intentions. Maggie reveals to Stanley that she told them everything he had done, outing him as a con artist and a murderer. They also reveal the head of the Museum of Morbid Curiosities curator; Lillian Hemmings, whom Desiree had murdered for revenge. Stanley pleads with them to let him live, claiming Elsa isn't to be trusted, and that she was the one who murdered Ethel. The freaks ignore him and proceed to chase Stanley around the camp with weapons, presumably murdering him under a wagon. Dandy visits the twins and warns them of Chester's dark past, but they demand him to leave after saying they don't trust him. Elsa introduces Jimmy to an old friend of hers, Massimo Dolcefino, who intends on making him a pair of prosthetics just as he did with Elsa. In a flashback, Massimo tells them of how he went after the men who took Elsa's legs, and slaughtered them one by one. All except the leader that is, Dr. Hans Gr√ºper (who also appears in American Horror Story: Asylum, mainly as the alias Dr Arthur Arden), who shot Massimo and tortured him until he was later released by a General. The next day, Chester rehearses the new routines. The twins, now suspicious of Chester, admit they no longer want to be his assistants after he asks to saw them in two as part of his performance. When they leave Maggie volunteers to do the trick instead and enters the box. While hallucinating about his deceased wife and her lover, Chester rigs the trick so it can't be performed properly. Not realizing what he had just done, Chester saws Maggie in half, killing her. To the freaks dismay, they find her body and decide to bury her. Chester runs out of the tent to his room where he then \\"murders\\" Marjorie for making him commit all those atrocities. Dot and Bette warn Elsa that she needs to leave immediately, as her monsters intend on killing her to avenge Ethel's murder. Desiree and the others raid Elsa's tent, but find that she's already gone. A bloody and distraught Chester walks into a police station and admits to a murder, revealing Marjorie to the confused officers. Elsa meets with Dandy before she leaves town and receives $10,000 in exchange for the freak show. As Dandy revels on his new stage, he discovers a mutilated Stanley, who now resembles Meep. His arms are amputated stumps, his lower torso is completely missing and his tongue has been removed, in an obvious homage to the fate of Cleopatra at the end of Tod Browning's Freaks, which Elsa referenced at the feast before the freaks attacked Stanley. Massimo delivers Jimmy his prosthetics, revealing wooden replicas of Jimmy's lobster claws. Jimmy calls them perfect, finally accepting himself for who he is.

Broadcasting on 105.3 MHz FM, XEINFO-AM is owned by XEFAJ-AM, S.A. de C.V., a company controlled by Eduardo Henkel Rojas. The station carries an alternative format known as Aire Libre. History Early years and Radio Centro operation The concession for 1560 AM at Ciudad Sat√©lite was originally awarded to Ruben Mar√≠n y Kall, with the callsign of XERMK-AM, in a concession dated January 26, 1962. The station was sold in 1966 to Clemente Serna Alvear and his Radio Programas de M√©xico and relaunched as English-language station XEVIP-AM in April 1966, becoming an affiliate of CBS Radio that July‚Äîits first in Latin America. In 1979, Grupo Radio Centro bought the station, changed its calls to XEFAJ-AM and introduced a regional Mexican format under the name \\"Radio Consentida\\". In 1983, the concession passed to Radio Industrial de la Provincia, S.A. de C.V. Infored/Monitor years In a 1998 contract, Grupo Radio Centro announced the transfer of XEJP-AM 1320 (now XENET-AM) and XEFAJ-AM 1560 to Jos√© Guti√©rrez Viv√≥, journalist and producer of the Monitor newscasts, then heard on Radio Centro's XERED-AM and XHRED-FM. Infored took over operation of the station in April 2000, changing its name in November to \\"La Banda 15-60\\" where it broadcast grupera music. In 2004, the station changed calls again, this time to XEINFO-AM, and the station returned to a news format as \\"Radio Monitor\\" when Radio Centro and Monitor parted ways. From 2006 to 2008, XENET- AM simulcasted XEINFO-AM. However, in June 2007, the legal fighting between Radio Centro and Monitor, which had severely hurt the latter's finances, forced the closure of both 1320 and 1560 AM from June 29 until September 3. Radio Centro was owed more than $100 million.Gabriel Sosa, \\"Radio Monitor y la huelga\\", El Universal 3 June 2008 On April 10, 2008, a sale was made to a creditor, Eduardo Henkel Rojas,In a 2017 note to El Financiero, Henkel noted that the acquisition was agreed in September 2007 and approved by Cofetel in December of the same year. but the sale reportedly could not be completed because workers of STIRT, Mexico's radio and television labor union, went on strike. Unlike XENET, which remained on-air until May 23, 2008 when the STIRT, whose members were angry about unpaid wages, raised its red and black flags at Radio Monitor, XEINFO suspended its programming on the day of the attempted sale. Interim operations and silence \\"La Mexicana\\" logo On March 19, 2011, XEINFO returned to the air with regional Mexican music. However, there were no commercials or branding, not even airing government or electoral spots, with the station only known by its call letters and frequency. The station's sparse identifications mentioned Grupo Radio Centro's control of the station, but such was never publicly confirmed or acknowledged by the company, nor mentioned on its website. Eventually, XEINFO went off the air again. In April 2017, a definitive court ruling against Guti√©rrez Viv√≥ opened the door for the station's future to be resolved. On May 15, 2017, coinciding with a major reshuffle of Grupo Radio Centro's AM radio stations, the format of XEEST-AM 1440, operated by Grupo Siete under contract to GRC, was moved to 1560 kHz, marking its first regular broadcasts in more than nine years; the station returned to XEEST on October 2 of that year and XEINFO went off the air again. AM-FM migration and relaunch as Aire Libre As part of the second wave of AM-FM migration in Mexico, XEINFO was selected as the lone commercial AM station in Mexico City to move to the FM band. It will broadcast as XHINFO-FM on 105.3 MHz. The new station could have a maximum effective radiated power of 3,000 watts and must broadcast in HD Radio as one of the conditions of second-wave migration. The selection of XEINFO triggered some dissatisfaction from the other AM-only commercial radio broadcasters, who had expected to go into a random drawing as provided for by the rules for second- wave migration. In the wake of the ruling, Capital Media, owners of competing applicant XEITE-AM, published several articles critical of the IFT in its newspaper, among other criticisms. Meanwhile, Henkel, operating the radio station directly for the first time since acquiring it, began building a team and facilities. Jos√© √Ålvarez, who gained fame as the program director of the legendary Radioactivo in the 1990s and early 2000s, was hired to run the new station. The project also brought on board Jos√© Luis Fern√°ndez Prieto and Rodrigo Gonz√°lez Calvillo, who brought with them the radio station they had won in the IFT-4 radio station auction of 2017, XHPTUL-FM 94.7 in Tulum, Quintana Roo, which will simulcast XHINFO. On June 21, 2018, the IFT approved the final technical parameters for the station, including a transmitter location in the Atlazolpa area of Mexico City with an effective radiated power of 2,000 watts. On August 9, test transmissions began for XHINFO-FM. Aire Libre held a formal press conference on October 25, 2018, to announce its formal programming with a November 1 launch date. At the conference, V√≠ctor Trujillo was announced as the station's morning show host, while programs helmed by Ilana Sod, who had previously worked at Radioactivo, and , who will host a show from Barcelona, were also revealed. Trujillo left after one year citing mental health reasons. The AM station was turned off in November 2019 after the required year of simulcasting.

In 1997, 1150 AM swapped callsigns and formats with 1320 AM, with this frequency becoming XEJP-AM and taking on 1150's longtime \\"Radio Variedades\\" format. In a 1998 contract, Grupo Radio Centro announced the transfer of XEJP-AM 1320 and XEFAJ-AM 1560 (now XEINFO-AM) to Jos√© Guti√©rrez Viv√≥, journalist and producer of the Monitor newscast, then heard on Radio Centro's XERED-AM and XHRED-FM.

From 2006 to 2008, XENET-AM simulcasted XEINFO-AM. However, in June 2007, the legal fighting between Radio Centro and Monitor, which had severely hurt the latter's finances, forced the suspension of programming of both 1320 and 1560 AM from June 29 until September 3 (during that time, both stations only aired instrumental music and occasional news updates). Radio Centro was owed more than $100 million.Gabriel Sosa, \\"Radio Monitor y la huelga\\", El Universal 3 June 2008 On April 10, 2008, XEINFO broke off because that station was sold to Eduardo Henkel Rojas. However, the final blow for Radio Monitor came when workers of STIRT, Mexico's radio and television labor union, went on strike. On May 23, 2008, STIRT, whose members were angry about unpaid wages, raised its red and black flags at Radio Monitor, and both stations went off the air. The station's last program was the noon edition of Monitor hosted by H√©ctor Jim√©nez Land√≠n, who in the last minutes of the newscast read a statement announcing the strike and total suspension of programming, thanking the audience for almost 34 years of listening to Monitor. The InfoRed strike ended on July 12, 2017; however, XENET's concession was not renewed, and it consequently expired as of July 3, 2016.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Bot. Misc. 14 The epithet, halei is in honor of Mason Hale who encouraged taxonomic revision of the genus Niebla. Distinguishing Features Niebla halei is characterized by a tiny hemispherical thallus, 1.5 cm high and 2.5 cm across, with numerous very narrow branches, 0.3‚Äì1.0 mm wide, arising from a common attachment area on rock, and by dividing several or more times, more so near apex where shortly bifurcate (bifurcation) or antler-like. Black dot-like pycnidia that generally characterize the genus are inconspicuous at apex of branches. The key lichen substance is divaricatic acid (with triterpenes). The increased branching of the thallus towards apex is similar to that of Niebla dactylifera, known only from San Nicolas Island; it differs in having the lichen substance, sekikaic acid. The cortical ridging and branching of N. halei are also similar to specimens collected by Charis Bratt on Santa Cruz Island (Bratt 6431) and in the Santa Ynez Mountains on mainland California (Bratt 7202), referred to Niebla testudinariaNiebla testudinaria, World Botanical Associates, retrieved 22 Dec 2014 by the larger size and less frequent occurrence of short bifurcate branches near apex. Taxonomic History Niebla halei was recognized as a result of undertaking a taxonomic revision of the genus towards development of a lichen flora of Baja California, beginning in 1986. A peer review of the manuscript in 1990 suggested that additional herbarium collections be studied, especially of Niebla collected in California and the Channel Islands. Additional specimens were studied through loans obtained by the U.S. National Herbarium (Smithsonian Institution) from the University of Colorado at Boulder and from the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. Niebla halei was discovered among the borrowed specimens of Niebla. The type (biology) of Niebla halei was collected by Albert William Herre, 13 July 1906.

It was designed by Robin Dods and built from 1908 to 1909 by Hall and Mayer. It is also known as Steele House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 August 2013.  History  Weemalla, located at 62 Ruthven Street, Corinda, a south-western suburb of Brisbane, was built in 1908-09. This single-storey timber house was designed by acclaimed architect Robert Smith (Robin) Dods as the suburban home of Robert Moore Steele, Queensland manager of the Victorian Insurance Company Ltd. It is an excellent example of Dods' residential designs for prosperous clients. Located from the centre of Brisbane, Corinda, initially part of a leasehold from 1851, opened for selection in the 1860s and a number of farms of between 25 and 70 acres were established. The opening of a railway bridge at Indooroopilly in 1876 reduced the area's isolation and encouraged subdivision. During the Brisbane land boom of the 1880s, when Brisbane's population doubled, many allotments were sold and residential building commenced. Corinda in the 1890s was one of Brisbane's sparsely settled new suburbs where the scattered estates of the wealthy, often set on hills, merged with small farms. Typically, Brisbane's elite resided in spacious properties located on hilltops or beside the river away from the polluted air, noise and commotion of the city, where breezes could counteract the summer heat. Members of Brisbane's elite \\"society\\" at the beginning of the twentieth century, which may be described as upper middle class, comprised pastoralists and wealthy merchants and those in managerial positions, such as Weemalla's first owner, RM Steele. Weemalla, located on Corinda Hill, a popular site for the homes of members of this echelon from the 1880s, was appropriately sited for an elite residence. By comparison to its southern counterparts Brisbane, by the 1890s was not a wealthy city and had few notably rich merchants or financiers. It was the location of headquarters for Queensland organisations and branch offices for interstate firms in the finance sector. None of the 87 insurance companies with offices or agents in Brisbane during the 1890s had its head office in Queensland. As manager of the Queensland branch of the Victoria Insurance Company Ltd from 1901, Steele was a member of this upper echelon of Brisbane society. He was a member of the Brisbane Club, an exclusive men's club, and an early member of the Toowong Bowling Club (established 1904), which at the time was a sport with elite connotations. Accompanied by his wife and son, Steele arrived from South Australia where he had opened and managed the Victoria Insurance Co. in Adelaide. Initially they lived in Toowong then Indooroopilly, both middle-class residential areas of Brisbane. In April 1908 Steele purchased two blocks of land, comprising , as the site of a new house for his growing family. In the following month local architecture firm, Hall & Dods advertised a tender for its construction. The job was won by Hall & Mayer and the house was completed during 1908-09 for ¬£953. Hall & Dods was a partnership between architects Francis Richard Hall and Robin Dods. Dods (1868-1920) was a New Zealand-born architect who lived briefly in Britain before coming to Brisbane in the 1870s. He later trained as an architect in Scotland and England under a number of esteemed architects who were working in the Arts and Crafts idiom. His architectural career began in Edinburgh in 1886, articled with architects Hay & Henderson. He attended evening classes at the Edinburgh Architectural Association until 1890 and formed a lasting friendship with (Sir) Robert Lorimer (1864-1929), eminent Scottish architect and fellow proponent of Arts and Crafts. In 1890 Dods moved to London, where he worked with the Fortifications Branch of the War Office and in the office of notable architect (Sir) Aston Webb. In 1891 he was admitted to the Royal Institute of British Architects and travelled in Italy. In 1894 Dods visited his mother in Brisbane and while there won a competition for a nurses' home at the Brisbane General Hospital (Royal Brisbane Hospital Nurses' Homes). He returned to Brisbane in 1896 and started in practice with architect Francis Hall as Hall & Dods. Dods has been acknowledged as \\"one of the most significant early 20th century Australian architects\\" and as a rare practitioner of the Arts and Crafts style in Queensland. Arts and Crafts was an international design movement flourishing between 1860 and 1910, its influence continuing into the 1930s. It was led by artist and writer William Morris and architect Charles Voysey and was inspired by the writings of John Ruskin and Augustus Pugin. The style championed traditional craftsmanship using simple forms and often applied medieval, romantic or folk styles of decoration. Importantly, it valued local variations in traditions so that good design would have relevance within its context. Arts and Crafts architecture is characterised by solidity and heaviness through well-proportioned solid forms, wide porches and prominent steep roofs. The texture of ordinary materials is expressed in the detailing and building composition is asymmetrical. The practice of Hall & Dods was the most influential source of modern design in Brisbane, producing a wide range of accomplished buildings, and was credited with achieving an \\"architectural revolution\\" in Brisbane. Dods was responsible for most of the design within the firm, integrating contemporary British design philosophies with the traditions of Queensland housing and the requirements of a subtropical climate, and producing practical, attractive, and finely-detailed houses. The partnership ended in 1913, when Dods left to practice in Sydney. Dods died prematurely in 1920. Dods' residential work employed local building techniques combined with a sophisticated discipline and a common-sense response to climate. Dods' houses were mostly built of timber with detailing that was a celebration of craftsmanship. The most noticeable characteristic of his Queensland houses (built between 1896 and 1917) was a general feeling of solidity and substance. This was the result of a number of design decisions, including designing a generous roof (often the largest element) continuous over the verandah and over a lower, rear washhouse. The roof was always simple in geometry and often finished with terracotta tiles, flat shingles or pan-and-tile profile, flat iron sheeting with a prominent rolled joint. Corrugated iron was used only as cost-saving measure. Generally low-set, the houses often had an enclosed or screened understorey to give the house a visually solid base. Individual elements were oversized to appear substantial as if under heavy loads. Bold, dark, earthy colours, darkly-stained timber, rough-sawn weatherboards with mitred corners, roughcast rendering and face brickwork in dark colours were used to give the house a weighty gravity. The building materials and finishes were chosen to allow the building to mellow over time, providing it with a well-established appearance. The house designs take a formalist approach to planning including formal entry halls and traditional planning arrangements. The plans were generated through a consideration of aspect, with living spaces well-oriented and internal layouts permitting cross ventilation. They are also notable for their informal spaces, a particular feature being the inclusion of generous verandah piazzas. The plans respond to the social needs of the clients in an honest and functional way. The houses were often provided with generous, considered service spaces including back halls and wash houses. The health and comfort of the occupants were major considerations. Ventilation devices included wide window and door openings, ventilated gables and ridges, and ventilation fleches. Piazzas were generous, allowing comfortably furnished, semi-outdoor living. Operable shading and enclosure of the piazza was sometimes achieved by adding timber vertical louvres above the verandah handrail, creating a room habitable in most weather. Interiors included fine decorative timber joinery and panelling. Fireplace surrounds and built-in cupboards were also a feature. The composition of facades and circulation routes is a more nuanced element of Dods' houses and highlights his originality and artistic skill. Facades often only implied symmetry. Entries were often off-centre or perpendicular, emphasised by wide and expressive entry stairs. Projecting bay windows and corner fireplaces were recurrent elements. Dods designed gardens as a setting for the house, a practice more common in Britain than in Queensland. They featured formal parterre gardens, terraces and walls, flower beds, tennis courts, hedges, topiaries, flowering ornamental trees, and geometric path and lawn layouts. Garden furniture and structures were designed including seats, pergolas, trellises, fences and gates. Weemalla bears Dods' architectural signature fully. The house was a low-set, detached, timber structure with a large, carefully modelled roof. The house front faced north and the land sloped to the north-east providing ideal orientation. The front facade had an implied symmetrical composition with a small gable at either end, although in reality the plan was not symmetrical. Under the eastern gable were the wide entry stairs with emphatic, large balustrade. The western gable was enclosed and a hexagonal bay window projected from the centre. The entry stairs led to a wide piazza that took advantage of the north-eastern corner with views to the distant horizon. Entry into the house was at 90 degrees via a small, square entry hall that had a projecting bay window with built-in timber seat. The entry hall was centrally placed but access to it was from the side through a glazed front door with an over-scaled, semi-circular fanlight. A central corridor ran from front to back with living rooms on the east and bedrooms on the west. The lounge and dining room were the principal interior spaces and opened onto the front piazza. The dining room had a large chimney breast with a timber mantle and surround. Verandahs ran around all sides of the house, connecting with a large back hall/verandah at the rear. The western verandah, which faced Dewar Terrace, was semi-enclosed above the balustrade to provide privacy to the adjacent bedrooms as well as sun control. The northern end of the western verandah was enclosed to form a bathroom. The service spaces were at the rear of the house, with a semi-enclosed rear stair leading to a laundry under the kitchen. The house sat centrally within the yard; if Dods designed a garden scheme, evidence of it has not been located. In 1916 ownership of Weemalla was transferred to Steele's wife, Beatrice. Steele was resident at Corinda and served as the Queensland Manager for the Victoria Insurance Co. Ltd until July 1928 when he was transferred to Sydney as the New South Wales manager of the company. In September 1937 Weemalla was advertised for auction and described as a sound, commodious bungalow with a north-eastern aspect set on . It was well built, with extra wide verandahs, four bedrooms, a maid's bedroom, a hall, large dining and lounge with an arch and brick fireplace. It had gas and fuel stoves, enamel bath, basin, and geyser. Its laundry had set-in tubs on a concrete floor. There was car accommodation and beautiful grounds with space for a tennis court. The house was not sold, however, and in September 1939 Steele's elder son William and his family moved into the house and resided there for the next two decades. RM Steele died in Sydney in August 1940, aged 74, only a month after his retirement from more than 58 years service with the Victoria Insurance Co., during which he had represented it in Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney. He was survived by his widow and two sons. Beatrice Steele died in 1960 leaving Weemalla to son William who subsequently sold the house in 1963. Weemalla remains largely unchanged since construction. It has been sold several times since 1963 and minor modifications have occurred including the enclosure of parts of the verandahs with glazing, the erection of a carport at the western side by Riddel Architecture, and the construction of an in-ground pool on the eastern side. In 1964 an extension accommodating a bedroom and bathroom was added to the rear (south-western) corner of the house. The design for the small extension was by Brisbane architecture firm Job & Froud, well known for their design of the Torbreck home units completed in 1960. Consistent with their other work, the extension at Weemalla was designed in an International style. This extension has been refurbished and reconfigured several times including in by Riddel Architecture when the entrance stair was rebuilt and the bathroom and kitchen refurbished. In 2013 Weemalla remains a family residence.  Description  Weemalla is a detached timber house in a suburban area of Corinda, located south-west of the centre of Brisbane. It is on a corner comprising two allotments totalling with Ruthven Street to the north and side access from Dewar Terrace to the west. The surrounding allotments are of similar size and have houses of similar age and scale. Weemalla is located centrally on its land with large trees, an in- ground swimming pool, and carport. The house, approximately , is timber-framed and -clad, set on timber stumps with a large hipped and gabled roof. It is in an Arts and Crafts style. The roof is conspicuously large and clad with corrugated metal sheets with a ventilated ridge cap. There are two brick chimneys of red face brick with bands of maroon brick and cement rendered cappings. The wide eaves have soffits either of fibrous sheet material or spaced timber battens, the latter being the original condition. A timber verandah with over-scaled posts and a battened balustrade wraps the north and east sides. The walls are clad with weatherboards that also enclose the majority of the understorey. The north-facing front elevation is flanked by small projecting gables with decorative awnings and timber dentil work. The roofs of the awnings are clad with pan-and-rib metal sheets. A narrow verandah runs across the front of the house between these gables, widening at the north-eastern corner to form a generous verandah piazza. Entry is via a wide timber stair onto the piazza under the north-eastern gable. The stair balustrade and entrance feature timber battens, large brackets, and other over-scaled timber elements. The north-western gable shelters a projecting room (the bathroom) and has a bay window supported on large timber brackets. The western elevation, facing Dewar Terrace, has a verandah enclosed with aluminium-framed, sliding windows and weatherboards. At the southern end of the verandah is a small lattice-enclosed entrance into the back hall. The rear elevation has a wide verandah enclosed with aluminium-framed, sliding windows and a large projecting gable at the eastern end containing the kitchen and service zones. Below the kitchen, the understorey is enclosed to form a laundry. A large painted, brick chimney breast is at the centre of the gable and is flanked by windows. A verandah runs the length of the eastern (side) elevation and is enclosed at the southern end by weatherboards and timber- framed casements. The main entrance timber door has bolection moulded panels and glazing surrounded by fan and side lights forming an unusual semi-circular feature. The glazing is clear and green leaded glass and the fanlight is operable, retaining an original brass mechanism. The door opens into a small foyer with a bay window with built in timber seat. The foyer ceiling is plaster with decorative mouldings. The house layout is organised off a central hall with rooms either side; bedrooms are to the west and living rooms are to the east. At the back of the house the hall ends in a wider back hall adjacent to a kitchen/service zone including a pantry and servant's room. A lattice- enclosed external stair connects the back hall with a laundry enclosure under the house. A bathroom is located at the north-western corner, accessible from the western verandah and from the master bedroom. Two small toilets are accommodated within enclosures on the western verandah. Generally, the rooms have timber board floors, timber tongue-and-groove board walls and ceilings with moulded timber skirtings, architraves, belt rails, and cornices. The ceilings are generally high with a lower ceiling () in the hall. The principal rooms (drawing and dining rooms) are connected by a large square opening with an elaborate architrave. These two rooms have larger and more elaborate skirtings and cornices than other rooms and the dining room has a fireplace with a decorative fire surround of painted timber panelling including a small amount of white marble. Internal doors are timber with moulded panelling and operable timber panelled fanlights that retain original brass opening mechanisms. Timber French doors with fanlights have fine, moulded glazing bars and clear glass lights and open onto the verandah from most rooms. One set of French doors has been modified into one large sliding door and another set has been relocated to enclose the verandah nearby. Other windows are double-hung timber sashes or timber casements with fine, moulded glazing bars and clear glass. Much of the original door and window furniture is retained. The house has several built-in storage cupboards with timber shelves. The opening between the foyer and the hall has an arched and battened fanlight. An early bell system survives with buttons in the main bedroom and the drawing room connected to bells in the back hall. The kitchen, servant's room, pantry, and large storage cupboard open from the back hall. The kitchen has a fireplace with a painted brick chimney breast. The laundry under the kitchen has a concrete floor. The room retains early or original fixtures including a concrete washtub and a copper tub built into the chimney breast. A small, timber-framed building is connected by a covered walkway to the south-western corner of the main house. The building has a hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets, weatherboard clad walls and accommodates a bedroom and bathroom. It is not of cultural heritage significance. The garden includes a large Jacaranda (Jacaranda mimosifolia), Camphor Laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), and Macadamia (possibly Macadamia tetraphylla). An early timber fence post is located at the north-west corner of the yard. It bears two different sets of post notches suggesting the Dewar Terrace fence was post-and-rail and the Ruthven Street fence was more finely crafted. The grounds contain a carport and swimming pool. The north-eastern piazza has views to the north-east of the surrounding suburbs and distant horizon. It is well positioned to receive the cool summer breezes from this direction as well as winter sun.  Heritage listing  Weemalla was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 August 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. Weemalla (1909) is important in illustrating the contribution of notable architect, Robert Smith (Robin) Dods, to the evolution of Queensland architecture. Weemalla is important for providing evidence of the lifestyle of Brisbane's prosperous elite in the outer suburbs in the early twentieth century. Built for the manager of a national insurance company, it also reflects the development of Brisbane as a commercial centre from the 1890s, not only as headquarters of Queensland companies but also as a branch centre for overseas and interstate companies. Weemalla is a fine, intact example of the high-quality residential work of Dods that is characterised by a pervading sense of tradition, solidity, and an honest use of materials. Designed in an Arts and Crafts idiom, the low-set timber house has deliberately oversized timber elements and openings; verandah piazza; steep dominant roof; finely-detailed, built-in timber furniture; a well-considered service zone; and an interior layout that optimises cross ventilation and solar orientation. Standing on a rise within a leafy suburban landscape, the low-set house with dominant roof and generous garden is important for its Arts and Crafts aesthetic. Notable for its fine craftsmanship, it features a skilful arrangement of informal and formal living spaces. A sense of simple elegant suburban domesticity is engendered by its generous verandahs and piazza and spacious living rooms.

San Francisco childhood Very little is known about Scheffauer's youth, education and his early adult years in America, or, about his parents and siblings. His father was Johann Georg Scheffauer, a cabinet maker (\\"Tischler\\"), probably born in 1842 in the village of Unterkochen, W√ºrttemberg, who, according to Hamburg passenger lists, had first immigrated to America in 1868, returning again to Germany where he married Maria Theresa Eisele in Augsburg, and who then came back with him to America in 1872.Who's Who in America: a Biographical Dictionary of Notable Living Men and Women of the United States. 1908‚Äì1909.

The family was related to the German painter and sculptor Philipp Jacob Scheffauer (1756‚Äì1808)\\"Scheffauer, Philipp Jacob\\", Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie 30 (1890), S. 672‚Äì676 (Onlinefassung) who it was said was his great- grandfather,\\"Die Tragodie eines Publizisten.

F. Huber and Friedrich H√∂lderin. Educated in public and private schools, he attended a Roman Catholic Sunday school in San Francisco, where services were conducted in German. He later wrote about the role of the nuns there and a certain Father Gerhard, instilling into the youth of this school terrifying and hellish religious imagery.Scheffauer in: Was wir Ernst Haeckel verdanken. Ein Buch der Verehrung und Dankbarkeit, 2 Bde. Hrsg. v. Heinrich Schmidt (Leipzig, 1914), 2, S.75. It is highly probable that Scheffauer had read the serialisation of James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man that, with Ezra Pound's assistance, had originally appeared in The Egoist (1914-1915). Heinrich Schmidt translated Scheffauer's English essay into German. His parents were not orthodox, in fact he spoke of being shocked by his father's religious indifference and scepticism. He discovered that he was a poet from about the age of ten, on a school outing, where the pupils ascended Mount Olympus in the Ashbury Heights neighbourhood of San Francisco. He impressed his school friends with his ability to recount the ascent, as he put it: > Suddenly I burst forth into a jog-trot doggerel. I chanted the heroic deeds > of the day ‚Äì the ascent of the peak, the routing of a belligerent bull, the > piratical manoeuvres on a pond. The delivery of this improvised epic was > volcanic. My companions regarded me with awe and suspicion. Thus, > primitively and barbarically, I began.

He began his career as an amateur printer, printing a broadsheet called The Owl while he was still at school writing satires on his schoolmates and teachers and \\"mournful valedictory odes\\". He went through a youthful period, through which he thought all young poets with an imaginative cast of mind must inevitably pass, namely a combination of what he termed \\"idealistic fanaticism and Byronic romanticism\\".Was wir Ernst Haeckel verdanken.

He later worked as an architect, a teacher of draughting and a water colourist.Who's who in America (1908), vol. 5, p.1663. Early intellectual influences He was aware that \\"Ingersoll was in the air\\",Was wir Ernst Haeckel verdanken, op. cit, S.76. a reference to the ideas of Robert G. Ingersoll the American freethinker and agnostic, and Scheffauer admitted that at first he looked upon Ingersoll and his followers as \\"enemies\\", and intellectually cowering, as it were, he read The Night Thoughts (1742) of the deeply religious English poet Edward Young to reaffirm his faith.\\"Ich f√ºhrte gegen sie flammende Stellen aus dem durch und durch d√ºsteren Werk Youngs, den \\"Nachtgedanken\\", an.\\" op. cit., S.77. However, he soon departed from his religiosity and became aware of the heated discussions about the 'missing link' in the writings of John Augustine Zahm, the priest and professor of physics at the University of Notre Dame (South Bend, Indiana). He said that the following authors came to his aid in California bringing him \\"light and fire\\",Was wir Ernst Haeckel verdanken, op. cit., S. 77. namely works by Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley, Arthur Schopenhauer, Herbert Spencer, Ludwig Feuerbach and Ludwig B√ºchner. Probably the greatest influence on his thinking, in the sense of a clearer scientific Weltanschauung, was a chance encounter with a work of the German zoologist, biologist and philosopher, and popularizer of Darwin's evolutionary theory, Ernst Haeckel. He came across the massively popular book 'Die Weltr√§tsel' (The world riddles or enigmas) in the F.W. Barkhouse bookshop, 213 Kearney Street, San Francisco, which was translated as The Riddle of the Universe at the close of the nineteenth century (1901). He bought a copy and read half of it the same evening and the rest in his architect bureau the following day. He would later describe himself as a monist poet, and claimed that together with his close friend George Sterling they represented \\"a new school of poetry\\" in California, developing \\"a poetry that sought to unify poetry with science\\".See Scheffauer's article \\"The Poetry in Our Path\\", in: Out West [Los Angeles, Cal.] New Series Vol. 2, June, 1911, Number 1, pp. 33-36. Proteg√© of Ambrose Bierce Scheffauer later gave up his architectural day job and wrote poetry and short stories. He was encouraged by his friend and mentor Ambrose Bierce the journalist, short story writer and veteran of the Civil War. How they actually first met is uncertain. It has been claimed,Edward F. O'Day, \\"The Poetry of San Francisco\\", The Lantern. Edited by Theodore F. Bonnet and Edward F. O'Day, Vol. 3. No. 6, September 1917, p. 176. that Bierce had first noticed a poem of his entitled The Fair Grounds that he had entered in a literary competition in 1893, organised by the San Francisco newspaper The Call. Scheffauer who was only 17 years of age had used the pseudonym Jonathan Stone, and his poem was favorably compared to the American romantic poet William Cullen Bryant.The Call (San Francisco), Vol. 74, Number 179, November 26, 1893. Bierce, who was 36 years older, became an alternative father figure for him and as a mentor criticized, encouraged and nurtured his poetic sensibility. Bierce published a number of his poems in his own \\"Prattle\\" columns. In 1899 Bierce was responsible for the so-called \\"Poe-Scheffauer affair\\". One of Scheffauer's poems, \\"The Sea of Serenity\\" (1893) was published in the San Francisco Examiner on March 12, 1899, albeit not under his own name but heralded as \\"an unpublished poem\\" of Edgar Allan Poe\\".See Carroll D. Hall, Bierce and the Poe hoax. With an Introduction by Carey McWilliams (San Francisco, The Book Club of California, 1934.) This carefully planned \\"Poe hoax\\" passed without creating too much attention. However, it elicited some of the greatest praise from Bierce for the young poet: > I am very far from saying that I think the poem mentioned was written by Poe > ... As to internal evidence‚Äî evidence inhering in the poem itself‚Äî that is > strongly in favor of Poe's authorship. If not written by him it was written > by his peer in that kind of writing‚Äî by one who has so thoroughly mastered > the method that there is nowhere a slip or fault. The writer, if not Poe, > has caught the trick of Poe's method utterly, in both form and manner, the > trick of his thought, the trick of his feeling and the trick of that > intangible something which eludes nomenclature, description and analysis ... > He need not fear any dimming of his glory, for distinctly greater than the > feat of hearing \\"a voice from the grave of Edgar Allan Poe\\" is the feat of > discovering a ventriloquist with that kind of voice. Another early poem of his, also written in the spirit of Poe, entitledThe Isle of the Dead (1894) was published the following year under his own name in the Californian Overland Monthly. The poem was published together with the image of the painting 'Die Toteninsel' by the Swiss-German artist Arnold B√∂cklin. Scheffauer translated Goethe, read Walt Whitman and Rudyard Kipling avidly, adored W. B. Yeats and discussed with Bierce varied themes such as the poems of the Irish poet Thomas Moore who he declared to be \\"the greatest of the lover poets\\"Walter Neale, Life of Ambrose Bierce (New York, 1929), p. 222. Poe also said of Moore's \\"Melodies\\" and the lines beginning:\\"Come, rest in this bosom.\\" that \\"The intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in Byron.\\" Poe also acclaimed his imaginative qualities in opposition to Coleridge. See the essay \\"The Poetic Principle\\" and Poe's review of Moore's 'Alciphron' in: \\"Tom Moore: Fancy and Imagination\\" both in: The Fall of the House of Usher, and other Tales and Prose Writings of Edgar Poe. Ed. by Ernest Rhys (London: Walter Scott Ltd.,1920), p.253; p.299-301. and the technical nature of Algernon Swinburne's alliteration. The full correspondence with Bierce has not yet been published but the encouragement and belief that he showed in him as a young American poet is palpable: \\"I so like the spirit of your letter of July 7! It gives me assurance of your future. You are to do great work, believe me. I shall not see it all, but that does not greatly matter, having the assurance of it.\\"AB to HS, August 4, 1903, p. 110. The publication of his first collection of poems Of Both Worlds (1903) was dedicated to Bierce. It has a number of English translations from Goethe, including Der K√∂nig in Thule from Faust. At about the same time he also began to read Nietzsche enthusiastically. Bierce was pleased with the effect this was having on him: \\"I can bless your new guide for at least one service to you‚Äîfor overturning one of your idols: the horrible God of the Hebrew mythology, horrible even in his softened character, as we now have him.\\"Ambrose Bierce to Herman Scheffauer, February 12, 1904, A Much Misunderstood Man: Selected Letters of Ambrose Bierce. Edited by S.T. Joshi and David E. Schultz (The Ohio State University Press, 2003), p. 118. Bierce's ironic 'blessing' of Nietzsche reveals the extent and legacy of Scheffauer's Catholic upbringing. As late as 1900 Scheffauer had written an Ode to Father Mathew for the occasion of a 10,000 gathering of the \\"League of the Cross\\" in San Francisco, in memory of the Irish Catholic priest Father Theobald Mathew (1790-1856), who was described as \\"the great apostle of temperance\\".See The San Francisco call., Sunday, October 28, 1900, p. 28. His friendship with the poet George Sterling, a contact encouraged by Bierce, had begun around February 1903, and it brought with it a whole circle of friends including Jack London,Scheffauer went sailing with him on his yacht 'Spray'. See Alex Kershaw, Jack London: A Life (St. Martin's Griffin, 2013), p. 131. Dr. C.W. Doyle,Dr. Charles William Doyle (1852‚Äì1903) Herman Whitaker, James Hopper, Frederick Bechdolt and especially other members of the Bohemian Club, such as the sculptor Haig Patigan, who all regularly met at the Bohemian Grove amid the magnificent red oaks at Monte Rio in Sonoma County, California. Bierce would later claim his literary \\"idols\\" were George Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen, and fell out with him much later (as he did with so many of his erstwhile disciples), irritated, as he wrote to him, with \\"the German ichor in the lenses of your eyes\\", an early and acute observation from Bierce of Scheffauer's troubled state of being as a hyphenated German-American:\\"You think your German blood helps you to be a good American. You think it gives you lofty ideals, knowledge, and much else. The same claim could be (and is, doubtless) made for every other nationality. Each tribesman thinks his tribe the best and greatest- even the Hottentot.\\"Ambrose Bierce to Herman Scheffauer, Washington, November 11, 1903, A Much Misunderstood Man: Selected Letters of Ambrose Bierce.

Haffmans Verlag, Z√ºrich 1999, p. 347, 370. After his mysterious disappearance in 1913 in Mexico and his presumed death, and despite their estrangement, Scheffauer's devotion to his former master was such that he was responsible for publishing and editing translations of collections of Bierce's short stories in Germany. As with many other American writers, he made Bierce's name known to a fascinated and receptive German literary public:Physiognomien des Todes. Novellen von Ambrose Bierce (1920) which was a translation of In the Midst of Life: Tales of Soldiers and Civilians,Joshi, S. T. and Schultz, David E. Ambrose Bierce: An Annotated Bibliography of Primary Sources. Westport, CT. and London, Greenwood Press, 1999, pp. 20-21. and Der Mann und die Schlange: Phantastische Erz√§hlungen von Ambrose Bierce (1922).See Friedel H. Bastein, \\"Bierce in the German-Speaking Countries (1892-1982); A Bibliography of Works by and about Him\\", in: American Literary Realism, Vol. 18, No. 1/2 (Spring-Autumn 1985), p. 231. Scheffauer wrote the introductions to both these collections of short stories. As a satirist, he compared him to Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift and in the German language with Heinrich Heine. He said that the acidity of his merciless humour had been neutralized by his fellow Americans' natural born abhorrence for satire.Scheffauer \\"Amerikanische Literatur der Gegenwart\\", in: Deutsche Rundschau, Vol. 186, 1921, p. 221. Tour of Europe and North Africa 1904‚Äì1906 Bierce knew of Scheffauer's plans for a tour of Europe as early as August 1903\\"When am I to see you on your way to Europe?\\" AB to HS, August 4, 1903, in: A Much Misunderstood Man: Selected Letters of Ambrose Bierce. Edited by S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz (The Ohio State University Press, 2003) and invited him to Washington beforehand. He provided him with letters of introduction for the English part of his journey. In July 1904 he left New York and sailed to Glasgow, before that he and Bierce were together in New York for about a month, and they also visited Percival Pollard the Anglo-German literary critic at Saybrook, Connecticut. Scheffauer went on a tour of Europe and North Africa 1904‚Äì1906. After about a month in England and Scotland where he cycled or 'wheeled' much, and clearly came to loathe English food, he went to Germany in October 1904 and was mesmerized by Berlin- which he spoke of as \\"the modern Babylon\\" and \\"the Chicago of Europe\\". He made what was almost a pilgrimage to Jena in Thuringia to see the world-famous scientist Ernst Haeckel. He presented Haeckel with works of poetry by his friend George Sterling The Testimony of the Suns and Other Poems (1903) and his own collection of poems Of Both Worlds (1903). He maintained a correspondence with him for over 15 years and would translate some of his works. As the European correspondent for the San Francisco magazine Town Talk in which he regularly sent back accounts of his travels and poems, his tour of the 'old world' included Paris, Monte Carlo,\\"Thus It Befell at Monte Carlo\\", The Pacific Weekly, Vol. XIV. No. 698, San Francisco, January 13, 1906, pp. 7, 38-39. Nice, Budapest, Vienna, Munich, Nuremberg,His stay in Nuremberg inspired him to write the poem \\"The Iron Virgin in the Five-Cornered Tower \\"(1905) Switzerland, Italy (Palermo, Rome, Milan, Turin, Naples,Scheffauer later wrote about his experience in Naples climbing Vesuvius: See Scheffauer \\"A Victory over Vesuvius\\", in: Macmillan's Magazine, Vol. 1.-New Series November 1905 to October 1906, pp.613‚Äì616. \\"That morning in February I awoke and found all Naples white with snow. Such a thing, said the natives, had not occurred for twenty years.\\" Capri), Spain (Barcelona, Zaragoza, Madrid, Toledo, Corboda, Seville (\\"The Spanish Paris\\"), Cadiz). He also travelled to Morocco (Tangier), Gibraltar, Algeciras, Granada, Tunisia and Algeria.See \\"Scheffauer's Letters\\", in: Town Talk, Vol. 14., (Saturday, September 16, 1905), p.12. Scheffauer as European correspondent for Town Talk First residence in London 1905‚Äì1907 He was back in London in the summer of 1905 where he regularly \\"mined\\" the British Museum. He joined the New Bohemian Club at The Prince's Head in the Strand, and drank what he thought was rather tepid English ale with literary figures such as Stephen Phillips, G. K. Chesterton and the poet and parliamentarian Hilaire Belloc.Belloc had visited California in 1890 and returned again in 1896 where, at Napa, he married an American, Elodie Hogan. He met Henry James who he found to be more English than American at a New Year's Eve party at the home of the writer Edmund Gosse.\\"In the Heart of Literary London\\", Town Talk, Vol. XIV. No. 700, Saturday, January 27, 1906, p. 13. He made a pilgrimage to Plymouth: \\"From Plymouth, as you know, sailed forth the blue-nosed Puritans to make laws just as blue and to burn witches in Massachusetts.\\" He also studied at Oxford University: \\"I'm spending a short time up here in this picturesque place of dead creeds and living prejudices. Have been attending special lectures and studying the life. It appears to me like an immense boys' school. There is little of the true scholastic spirit or the impetus of scientific research about the place ‚Äì nothing compared with the German universities.\\"Town Talk, Vol. XIV. No. 724, San Francisco, July 14, 1906, p. 10. In connection with his writings on Haeckel and his enthusiasm for the philosophy of Monism he worked closely with Joseph McCabe, who had translated Haeckel, visiting his home in Cricklewood, north-west London, a number of times, and later writing articles for Charles Albert Watts and the Rationalist Press Association. He continued to publish many short stories and poems in both English and American literary magazines.The Literary Writings in America: A Bibliography (1878-1927), (Kto Press a U.S. Division of Kraus- Thomson Organisation Limited, Millword, New York, 1977), Vol. 7 Rafinesque- Szymanowiki, pp.8826-8830. He was still in London at the time of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fires (April 18, 1906), and as vice presidentIn the San Francisco Architectural Club - Yearbook 1909 (1909)(Online: https://archive.org/stream/sanfranarch1909unse#page/n5/mode/2up ) his name is entered under \\"Leave of Absence\\", p.20. of the San Francisco Architectural Club, and one of James D. Phelan's lieutenants in the movement for beautifying the city, it was reported in Town Talk: \\"He is vindicating his loyalty to San Francisco in a way that should prove far more beneficial to the city than he could be were he at home. He is acting as a San Francisco promotion committee of one, and through him, since the fire, the readers of some of the European papers are learning more of this city than they ever knew before.\\"See Scheffauer's \\"The City Beautiful-San Francisco Rebuilt\\", The Architectural Review A Magazine of Architecture the Arts of Design, Vol. XX, No. 117, August 1906. Return to San Francisco and New York 1907‚Äì1911 He eventually returned to San Francisco early 1907. His second major collection of poems Looms of Life was published by Walter Neale in 1908, and in August of the same year his The Sons of Baldur. A Forest Music Drama was performed at the Bohemian Club of San Francisco. The previous year Sterling had been the \\"Sire\\"- the term adopted to describe the producer-in-chief of the Grove play- with his own verse drama \\"The Triumph of Bohemia\\". As Scheffauer himself explained: \\"These plays, part masque, part music-drama, part allegory, are a direct outgrowth of the nature-worship of the Californian, and are given in the majestic forest amphitheatre of the club in Sonoma County, amidst colossal redwoods older than the Pyramids. Here my \\"Sons of Baldur\\" was produced on a beautiful midsummer night.\\"\\"How I Began\\", T.P.'s Weekly, April 3, 1914, p. 419. Sterling's play had depicted a battle between the \\"Spirit of Bohemia\\" and Mammon for the souls of the grove's woodmen, Scheffauer's play was unmistakably Wagnerian with the god Baldur slaying the dragon Nidhugg that had been sent by Loki to destroy the woods and worshippers, symbolical of the Bohemians. He wrote his first novel, Niagara. An American Romance of four generations, finishing it in San Francisco in April 1909. A newspaper report suggested his journey to New York was connected with his novel. \\"On his way East Mr. Scheffauer will take in the North, in a roundabout way; will visit Seattle, attend the exposition, go on to Niagara Falls and remain there for some time before reaching New York. This young and brilliant author has met with instant appreciation and success.\\"Santa Cruz Sentinel, Santa Cruz, California, May 26, 1909, p. 3. He lived in New York from 1909-11 where he was a \\"worker\\" for more than two years at the University Settlement, very little is known about this period. As part of the University Settlement he lived in a house in the neighbourhood of lower east side, where he was clearly inspired to write his very successful play The New Shylock (1912), a study on Jewish- American life.Town Talk reported: \\"Scheffauer laid the scene of his tragedy \\"The New Shylock\\" in the New York Ghetto. The drama was translated into German by Leon Lenhard, the German translator of John Galsworthy's plays and stories. It was presented at the Municipal Theatre of Danzig last week, and registered an immediate hit. Scheffauer was present at the premiere and in response to repeated cries of \\"Author!\\" appeared before the curtain and made a graceful speech. Arrangements are now under way to have the play produced in Bonn, Strassburg and Posen, and a Berlin production will probably follow. Later on \\"The New Shylock\\" will be presented in New York.\\" \\"Scheffauer's Success\\", in: Town Talk, Vol. 22,(October 25, 1913), pp.11-12. Second residence in London 1911‚Äì1915 He moved back to London early 1911 and remained living there until 1915. He married the English poet, Ethel Talbot (1888‚Äì1976) who first published a collection of her poems with London Windows (1912). A contemporary review of her work said that in phraseology she follows largely Swinburne and William Ernest Henley.The Athenaeum, No. 4406, April 6, 1912, p. 364. She had written about how to read Poe in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of his birth, and Scheffauer had quoted her words, possibly from some correspondence between them: \\"The most perfect mood is a fugitive mental weariness that is neither sorrow nor longing; when you come then to Poe the lassitude gives way before the soothing sweetness of his unforgettable melodies\\".\\"The Baiting of Poe \\", in: Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, Vol. LIII-Second Series January‚ÄìJune 1909 (06-01-1909), p. 191 Scheffauer was struck with this \\"most excellent advice\\", as well as her youth and intelligence, already in May 1910 he had proclaimed her: \\"one of the most gifted as well as youngest of England's poets\\". He had found not only an English prot√©g√© but his Diotima. Scheffauer's romantic notions of love and marriage are contained in a strident epithalamium published in his collection Looms of Life (1908) entitled The Forging of the Rings. Their marriage took place at Highgate, North London on June 25, 1912, where soon after, they also moved into a house, Bank Point, on Jackson's Lane. Satirically reflecting on the outbreak of German spy-mania in England a few years later he would write: \\"Our house bore little resemblance to the conventional and ugly London villas all arrow. It was just such a place as would have appealed to a German spy, for it commanded a lordly view over all London. Precisely the place to give signals to Zeppelins!\\"See \\"London in August, 1914. Sleuth-Hound\\" and \\"Spy. By R. L. Orchelle\\", Issues and Events. A Weekly Magazine, pp. 179‚Äì81. This was originally published in The Continental Times. Bank Point, Jackson's Lane, Highgate, North London International success of his play The New Shylock In 1913 his play The New Shylock was performed at Danzig in Germany. The New York Times under the headline: \\"Danzig Applauds Scheffauer's Play\\" wrote: \\"Mr. Scheffauer attended the opening and responded to a number of enthusiastic curtain-calls. The play has already been bought for production in Bonn, Strassburg, and Posen, and negotiations for its production in Berlin are pending.\\"October 12, 1913 In November 1914 the play was performed at Annie Horniman's Repertory Theatre in Manchester, England, the first American drama ever written and performed at this theatre.Henry George Hibbert, \\"Fight on \\"The New Shylock.\\"\\", in: The New York Clipper. Oldest Theatrical Journal in America. Founded in 1853 by Frank Queen, 'Our London Letter' (December 5, 1914), p.2. A minor legal battle ensued between Scheffauer (who had the full backing of The Society of Authors) and the Jewish theatrical producer Philip Michael Faraday who attempted to censor some of the text. It was then transferred to London in 1914‚Äì15 under the changed title The Bargain. In 1915 it was performed at the Hague and in Amsterdam by the great Dutch actor Louis Bouwmeester (1842‚Äì1925)See Hayden Church, in: The Illustrated Buffalo Express, (Sunday, June 3, 1915): \\"... In Scheffauer's absence his agent sold the Dutch rights to Louis Bouwmeester the talented Dutch actor-manager who produced the piece forthwith. Under the title of Simon Lusskin it appears to have scored a big hit. Bouwmeester, in fact, has turned 'em away with it both at The Hague and in Amsterdam and royalties are flowing in ...\\" who was well known for his Shylock in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. In January 1915 it was reported in the London theatrical press that Princess Alexandra Kropotkin had undertaken the adaption of the play to the Russian stage.The Globe, Saturday 23 January 1915, p.5. It was also produced in America at the Comedy Theatre, New York in October 1915 in which the celebrated English actor Louis Calvert appeared playing the leading role of Simon Ehrlich.See \\"Death Of Louis Calvert.\\" The Times [London, England] (20 July 1923), p.14. Scheffauer's translations of Heine and Nietzsche In London he was a close friend of Oscar Levy, the editor of the first complete edition of Nietzsche's Collected Works (1909‚Äì1913) and contributed many English translations of Nietzsche's poems. Some of his Nietzsche translations appeared in his third major collection of poems Drake in California Ballads and Poems (1912). He published his translation of Heinrich Heine's Atta Troll. Ein Sommernachtstraum (1913), with illustrations by Willy Pogany, the Hungarian-American illustrator, who had first illustrated a short story of Scheffauer's in 1906. Levy wrote an introductory essay for it. He knew J. M. Kennedy, and many of that small \\"crew\\"\\"The Nietzsche Movement in England: A Retrospect, a Confession, and a Prospect\\", The New Age (December 26, 1912), p. 181. of British NietzscheansOn Levy, see Dan Stone, Breeding Superman.

A Weekly Review of Politics, Literature and Art, edited by A. R. Orage. Of all the British Nietzscheans he was undeniably closest to Horace B. Samuel (1883-1950), who translated a number of Strindberg's plays and eventually Nietzsche's The Genealogy of Morals(1913). H.B.S. had dedicated his first collection of poetry The Arrows of Adolescence (1909) to him: \\"To my dear friend and poetical mentor Herman Scheffauer I dedicate this book\\". In one letter to Ezra Pound, who also contributed regularly to The New Age, he assured him of their spiritual affinity: \\"Mr. Pound's opinion of things American is, I take it through his confessions, quite as healthy and unabashedly modest as my own.\\"\\"Through Alien Eyes\\", The New Age, February 6, 1913, p. 335 Scheffauer printed here a number of his poems including \\"The Prayer of Beggarman Death (A Rime Macabre)\\" and \\"Not After Alma-Tadema\\", as well as his English translation of Gabriele D'Annunzio's homage to Nietzsche \\"Per la Morte di un Distruttore\\". He published many short stories in the leading literary magazines such as Pall Mall, The Strand, The Lady's Realm and T.P.'s Weekly, and appears to have adopted a transatlantic strategy of publishing his stories in both British and American magazines.There is no modern bibliography of Scheffauer's works. Anti-war writings Some of his earliest poems The Ballad of the Battlefield (1900), or those from his Of Both Worlds (1903), such as The Song of the Slaughtered, Disarmament and Bellomaniacs, showed that his pacifist tendencies were quite pronounced. In 1906 he had even advocated an entente cordial between England and Germany. England ought to seek her \\"natural ally ... in a race and nation more closely related in all essential and significant points.\\"Scheffauer quoted in \\"The Peace Movement\\", The Review of Reviews (August 1906) 34, 200, p. 161. In 1925 he declared: \\"War is the most terrible hostage of mankind. My voice has always been loud for peace, long before it became a passion, a mode or a necessity to be a pacifist. I have not only spoken for peace, I have even fought against war.\\"Wenn ich Deutscher w√§r!, 1925, S.33. Cf. \\"My pen still spoke for Peace. Always it wrought for Reason./Still it obeyed Truth's mystic gravity - A loyal needle in and out of season/\\"Scheffauer, Infant, 1921, p. 23. In one of his rare science fiction short stories, \\"The Rider Through Relativity\\"(1921) the European battlefields of Flanders and the Champagne in WW1 are seen through a reversed chronology narrative.The short story was published in The Double Dealer, Vol. 1, No. 3 (March, 1921), pp.90-98.

His visionary expressionist play The Hollow Head of Mars: A Modern Masque in Four Phases appeared in April 1915, but we know that it had already been finished in 1913. Written in staccato blank verse he said that it was not \\"an insurrectionary experiment in vers libre\\" and that \\"It is useless to seek for parallels between the nations actually at war and these visionary combatants\\". His play had predicted the war and had seen through the hidden mechanisms that had encouraged its unfolding, depicting the sleepwalkers listening to the artificially produced voice of Mars, it is one of his most important but neglected works. The character of the 'Mountebank' is clearly presented as a Mephistophelean figure, whispering affectionately into the ear of 'The Minister of War' and gleefully drinking every drop of blood in his beaker and toasting \\"To Liberty\\". It is a character that is deliriously happy at the increasing numbers of soldier recruits that join him, their blood as the Minister says: \\"... shall manure The lilies of peace.\\"The Hollow Head of Mars by Herman Scheffauer, Author of The New Shylock, The Sons of Baldur, etc. (London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co., Ltd. 4, Stationer's Hall Court, E.C. 1915), 'The Third Phase', p.46. This macabre play on war shows him as a true prot√©g√© of Bierce. After the onset of the First World War throughout 1914‚Äì1917, during America's phase of neutrality, his articles sent from London back to the New York-based American pro-German magazines, under the aegis of the German-American Literary Defense Committee (GALDC), were widespread and numerous, it was here that he \\"fought against war\\" and attempted to influence America's position. He wrote chiefly for The Vital Issue (edited by Francis J.L. DorlOn Dorl's correspondence with Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and later internment, see J√∂rg Nagler, Nationale Minorit√§ten im Krieg \\"Feindliche Ausl√§nder\\" und die amerikanische Heimatfront w√§hrend des Ersten Weltkriegs (Hamburg, 2000), 517.) and The Fatherland (edited by George Sylvester Viereck who Scheffauer had known in New York literary salons since late 1909See \\"NO UNION, SALON FOR POETS ...\\"in: The New York Times (Feb 24, 1910); p.18.)

He wanted to familiarize himself with the circumstances in Germany and \\"better orientate himself\\" so that he could write more convincingly, and was seriously considering returning to America. However, after finding a flat in Berlin-Friedenau he was soon appointed editorThe New York Times called him a \\"sub-editor\\", whereas the Military Intelligence Bureau in Washington said he was the \\"editor\\", Scheffauer described himself as literary editor. of the pro- German American newspaper, The Continental Times: A Cosmopolitan Newspaper published for Americans in Europe, which was published three times a week. It boasted of sales in Austria, Italy, Switzerland, United States and the Netherlands and proclaimed itself in its headed paper as \\"The Leading Newspaper for Americans on the Continent\\".The Continental Times, (Wednesday, July 26, 1916), p.1. Writing for this newspaper he continued to use the pseudonym 'R.L. Orchelle'. He was a friend and colleague of the Irish nationalist Roger Casement in Berlin who also wrote for the newspaper. His most ferocious attacks were reserved for President Woodrow Wilson, whom he later called \\"the most despicable miscreant in history,- a man whose incapacity, dishonesty and treachery brought about the most terrible failure in human history\\" calling him \\"... a new kind of monster- a super-Tartuffe, unimagined even by Moliere, unachieved even by Shakespeare.\\"Blood Money: Woodrow Wilson and the Nobel peace prize, 1921, p. 9. As early as October 1915 he described Theodore Roosevelt as \\" a bloodthirsty demagogue\\" who was \\"openly inciting with a fanaticism that amounts to delirium\\".Preface to Ernst M√ºller- Meiningen: \\"Who are the Huns?\\" The Law of Nations and its breakers, 1915. Signed R. L. Orchelle, Berlin, Oct. 25. 1915 Scheffauer was indicted in the United States in absentia for treason in 1919 and it was for his work at The Continental Times that was cited as the main reason, despite the fact that he had resigned his position as literary editor in December 1916 before the United States had even entered the war. In March 1916 he had been attacked in The New York Times as one of a triumvirate of American poets (together with Ezra Pound and Viereck) who had turned their backs on their country: \\"In childish wrath they seek a foreign shore;/There, turning on the land they loved before,/They smear foul rhymes upon her honoured name ...\\".Schauffler, Robert Haven. \\"The Poets Without a Country\\", The New York Times, March 5, 1916. It was a letter to J.M. Kennedy that was cited by the federal grand jury as an example of his treason: > You say that I turned upon a country to which I professed allegiance in > favor of a country now its deadly enemy. I have never professed allegiance > to any country. To England I owe none. To America, as a born citizen, I owed > it only according to the dictates of my conscience. I oppose the policy of > America now- or that of the powers which have my unfortunate country in > thralls- as I have always opposed the English policy which dictated it, > because I knew it to be hopelessly, damnably wrong ... The ultimatum > presented to Wilson from Wall Street and the war profiteers, and its > acceptance, constitute the most infamous betrayal of a nation that the world > has ever seen.'POET HELD A TRAITOR: Herman Scheffauer Indicted for Hun > Propaganda.

Scheffauer never returned to the United States or to England (where he had been placed on a blacklist), and the irony of being a persecuted poet could not have escaped him, he had translated Heinrich Heine's own introductory words written in 1841 to his great comic masterpiece Atta Troll, \\"I am therefore celebrating my Christmas in an alien land, and it will be as an exile in a foreign country that I shall end my days\\".Atta Troll. From the German of Heinrich Heine by Herman Scheffauer. With Some Pen-and-ink Sketches by Willy Pog√†ny. (With an Introduction by Dr. Oscar Levy.).(London: Sidgwick & Jackson, 1913), p. 27. He wrote a trilogy of critical works on the theme of America (1923‚Äì25) believing that America was a natural 'biological' connecting link, or 'Bridge', between Germany and England. His only child was a daughter, Fiona Francisca Scheffauer (born circa 1919).The birth of his daughter Fiona Fransica is mentioned in his Ode in the context of his indictment, See: The Infant in the News=sheet: An Ode Against the Age (1921), \\"In her birth came to me a second birth/ And in my days of loss a glorious dower./ O exile's daughter/ That saw the dark at New Year in Berlin/ The child of one they charged with treason rank/ And sought to blacken with the spoor of sin/ Whose guilt was write in water/ By courts that in their corruption stank/. ... .\\"(pp.16/17) Friendship with Thomas Mann In April 1924 Scheffauer wrote about Thomas Mann's \\"crisp, skeptic, [and] collected mind ... a mind almost pedantic in its precision of expression, its tortuous searching for the exact word, the luminous phrase. Mann, who might in his externals pass for an English M.P. or a youngish major ...\\"\\"A Panorama of German Books by Herman George Scheffauer\\", in: The Living Age, July 12, 1924, pp. 72-75. His wife had also interviewed him. He had by then already translated Thomas Mann's Herr und Hund which had appeared in The Freeman (1922‚Äì23) in six instalments, it was then published as a book Bashan and I. Translated by H. G. Scheffauer. (Henry Holt, New York, 1923). Scheffauer was aware in July 1924 that Mann was close to finishing his \\"... study of a sick man in the environment of an Alpine sanatorium\\" and Mann wanted to entrust him with the translation of this novel 'Der Zauberberg'(The Magic Mountain), but failed, due to opposition of his American publisher Alfred A. Knopf.Armbrust, Heinz J. & Gert Heine: \\"Herman George Scheffauer\\", Wer ist wer im Leben von Thomas Mann. Ein Personenlexikon. Verlag Vittorio Klostermann, Frankfurt 2008, pp. 57, 247. The Magic Mountain was translated instead by Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter. Scheffauer translated Mann's 'Unordnung und fr√ºhes Leid' (Disorder and Early Sorrow) that appeared in the American literary journal The Dial. Knopf published in 1928 Children and Fools as the seventh volume of Mann's work in English translation, which consisted of nine stories all translated by Scheffauer, covering a period from 1898-1926. The blurb said: \\"Each work hitherto put into English represents Thomas Mann at one fixed point his evolution as an artist Children and Fools outlines, for the first time, that evolution as a process, and enables the reader to trace in one volume more than a quarter-century of the growth of as extraordinary a mind as our age is likely to know.\\" Romane der Welt [RdW] (Novels of the World) Scheffauer and Thomas Mann had a collegial, friendly relationship. He acknowledged his translation skills and looked upon him as an authority in Anglo-American literature.\\"Ich hatte den Mann pers√∂nlich gern, ich war ihm dankbar, weil er mehrere meiner Arbeiten mit au√üerordentlicher Kunst und Liebe ins Englische √ºbersetzt hatte, zudem galt er als ausgezeichneter Kenner der angels√§chsischen Literaturen.\\" [Thomas Mann GW 11: 760‚Äì1] Scheffauer told Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche in 1924 that Mann had assured him that he much preferred reading his English translation of Herr und Hund rather than the original German. In April 1927, they launched a series Romane der Welt (Novels of the World), that was published by Thomas Knaur Nachfolger Verlag in Berlin. Each week a novel that cost only 2,85 Marks appeared in the RdW series, on the back of the dust-jacket it proclaimed in German: \\"Every Friday a new volume/Every novel an experience\\". It included authors such as Herman Melville's Moby Dick oder Der Weisse Wal and Taipi and Cashel Byrons Beruf by George Bernard Shaw (with forewords by Scheffauer); works by Hugh Walpole, Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton, P. G. Wodehouse, John Galsworthy, Radclyffe Hall, Arnold Bennett, Francis Brett Young and Liam O'Flaherty. The choice of American literature very much reflecting his ideas he gave in a key lecture at the University of Berlin in 1921 and contained in his chapter on 'Art and Literature' in his first work on America Das Land Gottes(God's Own Land) (1923), thus, the work of his friend Sinclair Lewis Die Hauptstrasse (Main Street) and Babbitt, appeared in the series, of which he had previously written: \\"These books reveal the worm gnawing at the heart of American life, the inner doubt and unhappiness, the unhappiness which results from the hollowness within and the shallowness of life without- and which seeks to distract itself by a ceaseless external activity.\\"\\"Dieser B√ºcher zeigen den Wurm, der am Herzen des amerikanischen Lebens nagt, den tiefen Zweifel und die Unseligkeit, die aus der inneren Hohlheit und √§u√üeren Flachheit des Lebens entspringt und die sich in unaufh√∂rlicher √§u√üerer T√§tigkeit zu zerstreuen sucht. Scheffauer, Das Land Gottes. Das Gesicht des neuen Amerika (1923), S. 189. Novels by Joseph Hergesheimer such as Java Head; and Tampico (also with a foreword by Scheffauer), Floyd Dell, 'George Challis' the pseudonym of Max Brand, Lesley Storm and Mary Borden, as well as many westerns by Zane Grey. German works published in RdW were by Eugen Binder von Krieglstein and Conrad Ferdinand Meyer. The series also included French, Spanish, Swiss, Canadian, Swedish and Brazilian authors. The democratic intent of the series was palpable, and it was attacked in some conservative literary circles as unnecessary 'flooding' of the German market. Mann wanted his Buddenbrooks to appear in the RdW in 1926.See Reinhard Wittmann, Geschichte des deutschen Buchhandels. Ein Ueberblick (M√ºnchen: Verlag C. H. Beck, 1991), X. Der Buchhandel in der Weimarer Republik, S.310-311. He thought it was quite unique, and from a social point of view something remarkable, he wanted his novel \\"to be thrown into the wide masses in a series of classical works of world literature in a popular edition\\" but his publisher Fischer, rejected the idea.Ernst Fischer, Bd. 2, Thl. 1, S.296. The letter is reprinted in Gottfried Bermann Fischer, Bedroht-bewahrt. Der Weg eines Verlegers. (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 1967), S.66-69. Scheffauer was present at the first meeting of the German PEN-Group on December 15, 1924 that had named Ludwig Fulda as its first president, and he was also a close friend of Walter von Molo.Unpublished letter of Walter von Molo to Scheffauer (Berlin, 25.1.1926) See Autographen Deutschland - Das Fachantiquariat f√ºr Originalhandschriften http://www.autographen- deutschland.com/angebote.php?name=scheffauer&price;=&submit;=Suchen&page;=2 Berlin Correspondent for The New York Times Herman and Ethel Scheffauer both contributed regularly to The Bookman: An Illustrated Magazine of Literature and Life providing fascinating details about the German literary and publishing world. They also both wrote regularly for the English monthly edition of the Berliner Tageblatt. Scheffauer was also the Berlin correspondent for The New York Times, as well as some other leading American newspapers, and he worked tirelessly as a literary agent for a number of British and American publishing companies. In 1925, eleven of his short stories were published in German translation Das Champagnerschiff und andere Geschichten (Berlin, 1925). He had already published the story that he gave as its main title \\"The Champagne Ship\\" back in January 1912 in New York in one of Frank Munsey's so-called \\"pulp magazines\\", The Cavalier and the Scrap Book.The Cavalier, (January 6, 1912) Scheffauer never relinquished his original vocation as both poet and architect, he regarded words as things with which to build. His love of architecture in the 1920s was reaffirmed again with articles on Erich Mendelsohn, Walter Gropius, Hans Poelzig, Bruno Taut and the Bauhaus movement. Scheffauer played an important role in describing some of the contemporary art-movements in Germany for a wider English and American audience and his unique position was his personal acquaintance with these same figures. This is apparent from the collections of essays that he published in his The New Vision in the German Arts (1924), a work that received acclaimed reviews in America, particularly for its attempts to communicate to an English audience the meaning of expressionism in German literature and poetry. Scheffauer also wrote considerably on German expressionist cinema such as Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu (1922), and much later Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927)\\"An impression of the German film Metropolis\\", New York Times, March 6, 1927, pg. 7. He wrote passionately about film and praised it as \\"a new stereoscopic universe\\" where space had been given a new voice in a \\"cubistic world of intense relief and depth\\"\\"Cubism on the Screen\\", The New York Times, November 28, 1920, p. 79 As both poet and architect he would write on this Vivifying of Space: > Space ‚Äì hitherto considered and treated as something dead and static, a mere > inert screen or frame, often of no more significance than the painted > balustrade background at the village photographer's - has been smitten into > life, into movement and conscious expression. A fourth dimension has begun > to evolve out of this photographic cosmos.Scheffauer, \\"The Vivifying of > Space\\", Freeman (24 November-1 December 1920); reprinted in Lewis Jacobs, > ed., Introduction to the Art of the Movies (New York: Noonday Press, 1960), > pp.76-85. The architectural historian, Anthony Vidlerhttp://cooper.edu/architecture/people/anthony-vidler has written: \\"Scheffauer anticipates all the later commonplaces of expressionistic criticism from Siegfried Kracauer to Rudolf Kurtz.\\"Anthony Vidler, Warped Space: Art, Architecture and Anxiety in Modern Culture (MIT Press, 2002), p. 104.; cf.J. P. Telotte, Animating Space: From Mickey to Wall-E. (University Press of Kentucky, 2010) pp.223-4. His aesthetic and sociological criticism was tinged with his own incomplete attempt at \\"de-Americanisation\\" [\\"weil er nicht g√§nzlich ent-amerikanisieret ist\\"] ‚Äì as his friend Oscar Levy once put it,See Oskar Levy \\"Der Fall Herman George Scheffauer\\", in: Das Tagebuch[Berlin], 1924, 5. Jahrgang, 1. Halbjahr, S. 11-17. and it was also very clear to Levy that Scheffauer still retained a fair share of American puritanism that so animated all of his criticism. Scheffauer's collection of essays: The New Vision in the German Arts (London,1924) was testimony to this unique German-American poetical and philosophical sensibility.See \\"Expressionism for America\\". Scheffauer's work reviewed by Gorham Bockhaven Munson (1896-1969), in: New York Evening Post Literary Review, (August 2, 1924), p.930. Scheffauer's suicide 1927 Scheffauer killed himself and Katherine von Meyer, 23, his private secretary, in 1927 at the age of 51 years. It was a horrific act of mental derangement brought on at a time when he was suffering from an extreme depression. Scheffauer cut his own throat and hurled himself from the window of his third storey flat; a search of his home quickly discovered the body of his secretary, apparently murdered by a single stab wound to the breast.\\"The Morning Post\\" (October 7, 1927) He wrote to his wife shortly before he killed himself, who was staying with their daughter at their villa at Die√üen am Ammersee, Bavaria, that he was in great \\"mental torment\\", and that each autumnal day it felt as if he was \\"... suffering the death of ten thousand mortal agonies\\". A couple of letters between Scheffauer and his wife were published (in German translation)\\"Scheffauer's Abschiedsbrief\\", in: Hamburger Anzeiger (13 Oct 1927), p. 10.) to scotch some of the rumours that had arisen in the press about their own relationship and of the moral integrity of his secretary. The PEN Club of Berlin, of which he was a founding member and its secretary, held a memorial service for him on October 27 together with a madrigal choir. Karl Oscar Bertling the director of the Berliner Amerika-Institut at the University of Berlin, gave a speech and spoke of Scheffauer's \\"poetic mission\\"(dichterische Sendung) and his \\"artistic priestliness\\"(kunstlerisches Priestertum). Thomas Mann also attended and in his speech praised his ability as a translator of his works and attempted to explain his unhappiness at the end of his life, of which he admitted he had not the slightest idea, he thought it was due to the nature of his \\"undomiciled internationality\\"(der unbeheimateten Internationalit√§t).\\"Trauerfeier f√ºr Herman George Scheffauer\\", Berliner Tageblatt (October 28, 1927), p. 3 The American writer Sinclair Lewis also gave a passionate speech at this memorial service for his \\"friend in struggle\\". According to newspaper reports, his body was transferred to Die√üen am Ammersee, where he was buried. Autograph from Berlin, May 1925 Selected works Poems, stories and plays: * The Isle of the Dead.

He was initially an officer for the state of Min. In Min's last years, he rebelled against its last emperor Wang Yanzheng and seized control of the Fu Prefecture (Á¶èÂ∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) region, initially in nominal allegiance to both Southern Tang and Later Jin. When Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing tried to force to yield actual control to the Southern Tang imperial government, however, he turned his allegiance to Wuyue and fought off the Southern Tang attack with Wuyue aid. When his relationship with the Wuyue general Bao Xiurang () eventually broke down, he considered killing Bao and resubmitting to Southern Tang, but Bao discovered this and killed him first, allowing Wuyue to take actual control over the region.  Background and rebellion against Min  It is not known when Li Renda was born. He was said to be \\"of Guang Prefecture\\" (ÂÖâÂ∑û, in modern Xinyang, Henan)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284.‚Äîbut that probably did not denote that he was born there, but rather that his ancestors were from there, as the original Guang Prefectures immigrants to the Fujian region were led by Wang Chao, the brother of Min's founder Wang Shenzhi (Prince Zhongyi), in deciding to remain, in 885‚Äîsix decades before Li Renda's coming of power.See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Li Renda himself at some point became an officer‚Äîthe commander of the Yuancong Corps ()‚Äîfor Min, but after reaching that position, did not receive another promotion for 15 years. During the time that Wang Shenzhi's son Wang Xi (Emperor Jingzong) (with his capital at Min's traditional capital Fu Prefecture) and his younger brother Wang Yanzheng (with his headquarters at Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian) and who would later claim the title of emperor of a new branch state of Yin) were engaged in civil war,The civil war between Wang Xi and Wang Yanzheng began in 940 and ended (with Wang Xi's assassination) in 944, so Li's defection would have occurred sometime during those years. See Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 282, 284. Li defected from Wang Xi's imperial regime to Wang Yanzheng, who made Li one of his generals. However, when the general Zhu Wenjin assassinated Wang Xi in 944 and claimed the throne himself, Li redefected to Zhu and offered strategies to capture Jian. Zhu, disliking Li for his treacherousness, refused to give him any commissions and forced him into retirement at Fuqing (Á¶èÊ∏Ö, in modern Fuzhou). In late 944, Zhu had in turn been assassinated by the officer Lin Renhan (), who then submitted Fu to Wang Yanzheng's control. Wang Yanzheng reclaimed the title of Emperor of Min, but decided not to move the capital back from Jian to Fu, believing that he needed to remain at Jian to resist an incoming Southern Tang invasion. Instead, he commissioned his nephew Wang Jichang to oversee Fu, which he made the southern capital. He sent the general Huang Renfeng () to assist Wang Jichang. With Fu under Wang Yanzheng's control, Li was concerned what would happen to him. Similarly concerned was one Chen Jixun (), who had defected from Wang Yanzheng to Wang Xi. They decided to approach Huang, arguing to him that Wang Yanzheng himself was in a precarious position due to the Southern Tang attack, and that Huang should rebel against him and seize Fu. Huang agreed. These co- conspirators then led the soldiers and attacked the headquarters, killing Wang Jichang and another general Wang Yanzheng left to assist Wang Jichang, Wu Chengyi ().  Under the Zhuo Yanming regime  It was said that Li Renda considered immediately taking power himself, but did not believe that the soldiers would be ready to follow him. Therefore, knowing that Zhuo Yanming, a monk at Xuefeng Temple (), had long been respected by the people, and therefore proclaimed, \\"This monk has multiple pupils, and has arms reaching below his knees. These are signs of a true Son of Heaven.\\" He proclaimed Zhuo emperor and put imperial robes on him ‚Äî yet simultaneously, having the regime use the era name of Later Jin and sending emissaries to Later Jin to pledge loyalty. When Wang Yanzheng heard this, he slaughtered Huang Renfeng's family and sent the general Zhang Hanzhen () to rendezvous with troops from Zhang (Êº≥Â∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) and Quan (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), which had recently submitted to him, to attack the new Zhuo regime. When Zhang's army arrived at Fu, however, Huang, having received news that his family had been slaughtered, fought with great ferocity, and he defeated and captured Zhang, who was then executed. Li put himself in command of Zhuo's imperial guards, and had Huang defend Fu's west gate and Chen Jixun defend its north gate. However, one day, Huang lamented to Chen his regrets in rebelling against Wang Yanzheng, stating: Chen warned him that lamenting in this way would bring disaster, but Huang apparently continued to do so. When Li became aware, he had others falsely accuse Huang and Chen of treason, and had them arrested and executed. After their death, Li consolidated the command in his own hands. Not long after, he held a grand review of the troops and had Zhuo attend to view them. At the review, he had a soldier assassinate Zhuo. (Zhuo's father, whom Zhuo had honored as retired emperor, was also put to death.) Soldiers that Li had pre-conspired with placed him on Zhuo's throne. Li, however, did not claim imperial title, but rather only claimed the title of acting military governor of Weiwu Circuit (Â®ÅÊ≠¶, traditionally headquartered at Fu). He started using Southern Tang's Baoda era name, yet at the same time also sent emissaries to pledge allegiance to Later Jin and to establish friendly relations with Wuyue. Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing made Li Renda the military governor of Weiwu and honorary chancellor (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã, Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi), and added him to the roll of imperial clan members (as he shared the surname of Li with the Southern Tang emperors). Li Jing also gave him a new name of Li Hongyi.  Under dual allegiance to Southern Tang and Later Jin  In fall 945, Jian Prefecture fell to the sieging Southern Tang troops commanded by the general Cha Wenhui (). Wang Yanzheng surrendered, ending Min, and subsequently, all of the former Min realm (at least nominally) submitted to Southern Tang. Subsequently, a member of the Min imperial clan, Wang Jixun (), who was then the prefect of Quan, wrote to Li Renda, offering to establish friendly relations, but Li Renda took offense, as traditionally, Quan was part of and subordinate to the military governor of Weiwu; he thus sent his younger brother Li Hongtong () to attack Quan in late-spring 946. Wang Jixun's officer Liu Congxiao used this as an opportunity to depose Wang and take over Quan, and then repelled Li Hongtong's attack.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. Previously, when Cha captured Jian, there were suggestions made to the Southern Tang court that the army advance and take over Fu as well. Li Jing declined ordering so, and his chief of staff Chen Jue offered to go on a diplomatic mission to Fu, to try to persuade Li Hongyi to give up his de facto self-governing status and report to the Southern Tang capital Jinling. To try to show good grace to Li Hongyi, before Chen's mission, Li Jing bestowed lady titles on Li Hongyi's mother and wife, and granted offices to his four younger brothers. Further, Chen arrived at Fu with gold and silk to be awarded to Li Hongyi. However, Li Hongyi, knowing what Chen was there to do, treated Chen with coldness and disrespect. Fearful, Chen left Fu without even bringing up the matter of summoning him to Jinling. As Chen was on the way back to Jinling, when he reached Jian Prefecture (ÂäçÂ∑û, in modern Nanping, note different location than the former Min capital), he issued edicts in Li Jing's name (without Li Jing's approval) ordering Li Hongyi to report to Jinling. The false edict also named Chen the acting overseer at Fu and launched troops from Ting (Ê±ÄÂ∑û, in modern Longyan, Fujian), Jian (the former Min capital), F«î (Êí´Â∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi, note different location), and Xin (‰ø°Â∑û, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi) Prefectures, under the command of the Jian army monitor Feng Yanlu, to head toward Fu to pressure Li Hongyi. When Feng wrote Li Hongyi to try to persuade him to give up his control of Fu, however, Li Hongyi responded and challenged him to a battle. While Feng initially defeated Li Hongyi's general Yang Chongbao (), they were defeated at Fu when engaging Li Hongyi himself. Li Jing, initially angry that Chen had forged his edict, decided to try to reinforce his and Feng's army to try to defeat Li Hongyi, and therefore put the senior general Wang Chongwen () in command of an army to further siege Fu. The outer city quickly fell, but Li Hongyi was able to hold the defense of the inner city, and the Southern Tang attack bogged down.  Break with Southern Tang and allegiance to Wuyue  Li Hongyi changed his name to Li Hongda, apparently to show a break with Southern Tang, and submitted a petition to submit to Later Jin. Later Jin's emperor Shi Chonggui commissioned him the military governor of Weiwu and the overseer of the state of Min. Li Hongda then again changed his name to Li Da (apparently in naming taboo for Wuyue's king Qian Hongzuo), and sought aid from Wuyue, offering to submit as a subject. An initial Wuyue attachment quickly arrived at Fu and helped him defend the city, but was unable to break the Southern Tang siege, which became tighter and tighter. However, the Southern Tang army was hampered by discord ‚Äî as while Wang Chongwen was the overall commander of the army, the officials Chen Jue, Feng Yanlu, and Wei Cen () all tried to give orders as well, while Liu Congxiao and Wang Jianfeng () were also not obedient of Wang Chongwen's orders. When another Wuyue detachment, commanded by the general Yu An () arrived, Feng, taking it lightly, advocated allowing it to land so that it could be destroyed on land. Instead, once the Wuyue forces landed, it coalesced fiercely and crushed the Southern Tang forces, forcing them to withdraw. Yu entered the city and took up position there with a Wuyue garrison. Yu subsequently returned to the Wuyue capital Qiantang, and Qian sent the general Bao Xiurang () to command the Wuyue garrison at Fu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. In July 947, Qian Hongzuo died and was succeeded by his brother Qian Hongzong. Li Da, leaving his brother Li Tong (i.e., Li Hongtong, who apparently also changed his name at the time that Li Da changed his) at Fu as the acting military governor, went to Qiantang to pay homage to the new king. Qian Hongzong bestowed on him the greater honorary chancellor title Shizhong () and gave him a new name of Li Ruyun. Li Ruyun soon became apprehensive that Qian Hongzong might keep him at Qiantang, and, using 20 gold bamboo shoots, bribed the powerful general Hu Jinsi, requesting to be allowed to return to Fu. Hu thus spoke on Li's behalf, and Qian allowed Li to return to Fu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287.  Death  At some point, however, Li Ruyun developed a discord with Bao Xiurang, and therefore considered assassinating Bao and resubmitting to Southern Tang. When Bao realized this, he acted first and attacked Li's mansion, killing him and slaughtering his family, including his brother Li Tong.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 98. Bao delivered Li Ruyun's head to Qiantang, and Qian Hongzong subsequently sent the chancellor Wu Cheng to take over as the military governor of Weiwu.

It was designed by Colonial Architect's Office and built in 1887 by William Ferguson. It is also known as Fortitude Valley Post & Telegraph Office. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 January 2003.  History  Fortitude Valley Post Office, circa 1907 The Fortitude Valley Post Office and Telegraph Office, as it was first called, was constructed in 1887 by William Ferguson for the Queensland Post and Telegraph Department to a design prepared by the Colonial Architect's Office of the Department of Public Works. The original working drawings are unsigned however it is believed that the design was carried out by either John James Clark, who was the Colonial Architect from 1883 to 1886 or George St Paul Connolly, who held the position from 1887 to 1891. The building, composed in the Victorian Italianate architectural style, is one of only ten substantial Queensland post offices designed in this style that were all built between 1879 and 1898. Comparatively, the Fortitude Valley Post Office has the most ornately detailed cement-rendered facade and is the only post office designed and constructed with mansard roofs. The building was also one of only two masonry post offices that were built in 1887 ‚Äì all others were constructed of timber. Government policies in 1887 required that post and telegraph services were combined, and that accommodation for postmasters and their families be provided. Accordingly, the Fortitude Valley Post Office was designed to have post and telegraph services at ground level with living quarters above. A single-storey service wing originally extended northwards to the rear of the building and opened onto a fenced courtyard abutting Ballow Street. Internally the ground floor consisted of a spacious office area for the combined services of post and telegraph. Access to the postal services was via the vestibule located at the corner of Ann and Ballow Streets that led to a small public area with a diagonal counter. Telegraph or parcel services were accessed via the smaller vestibule located at the far end of the arcade facing Ann Street. The first floor was occupied entirely by the postmaster's living quarters and consisted of two living rooms, four bedrooms and an internal bathroom. The single-storey service wing at the rear consists of the postmaster's dining room, kitchen and servant's room. Earth closets were located adjacent to the kitchen, in northern corner of the site. At the time of the Fortitude Valley Post Office's construction, the suburb was experiencing a period of great business and residential expansion. Nearby areas such as New Farm and Teneriffe to the east and Breakfast Creek and Bulimba Reach to the north were similarly experiencing expansion. The opening of the Teneriffe wharves to international shipping accelerated the growth of the area and this, together with a large increase in the volume of business, placed severe strain on the original postal and telegraph facilities in Fortitude Valley that had been set up in 1877. The government's purchase of the site at the corner of Ann and Ballow Streets in 1884 caused a controversy amongst the local residents and businesses in Fortitude Valley who desirous of a centrally located post office closer to the centre of business, at the corner of Brunswick and Wickham Streets. The matter caused some debate within the Post and Telegraph Department in 1885; however plans for the Ann Street site proceeded irrespectively. Aversion to the post office's location persisted among the local community for many years until eventually the matter was settled in 1936 by the Director-General of the Postmaster-General's Department in Melbourne who declared that funds for the construction of a new post office would not be available. Following the Federation of Australia, Postmaster General's Department was established in 1901, after which the responsibility for the Fortitude Valley Post Office was transferred to the Australian Government. Minor alterations were made to the ground floor interior in 1909 and again in 1925. It was around this time that the post office took on the ancillary responsibility of social security payments. A report prepared by the Acting District Inspector in November 1929 stated that 1,205 pensions were being paid weekly from the Fortitude Valley Post Office and it was understood that this was, with one exception, the heaviest pensions paying centre in Australia at the time. Documentation of the removal of the mansard roofs and cast concrete capitals from the Fortitude Valley Post Office has not been found; however, it is believed to have occurred prior to 1949. Pressure from the Australian Government to expand facilities eventually led to the vacation of the postmaster from the first floor . It was proposed that the rooms be used for a Telegraph and Despatch room and staff facilities; however the area was used minimally thereafter. In 1958 major alterations were carried out on the entire building. Amongst these changes was the introduction of a stairwell in the main entrance vestibule, private letter boxes in the smaller vestibule off Ann Street, removal of all interior walls on the first floor and the partial rebuilding of the service wing at the rear. Further alterations, carried in 1970, caused the rear wing to be completely demolished and replaced with a larger two-storey wing that abuts Ballow Street. Substantial reorganisation of the original post office's interior was also carried out at this time. Suspended ceilings were introduced in some areas of the ground floor at this time. The Postmaster General's Department remained responsible for the Fortitude Valley Post Office until 1975 when Australia Post and Telecom Australia were created, thus dividing the postal and telecommunication services into two semi-government departments. Australia Post carried out alterations to the building in 1987, which effectively stripped the ground- floor interior of all previous accretions. Externally, some restoration of the original fabric was carried out and a historic colour scheme was reinstated. By 2010, it was being used as the GPO Hotel.  Description  Side view, 2014 Arcade, 2014 The Fortitude Valley Post Office occupies an almost level south- east corner site at Ann and Ballow Streets, Fortitude Valley, Brisbane. The original building occupies approximately 40 per cent of the existing site allotment No. 21. The Post Office is a two storey brickwork, steel and timber construction, with porphyry footings. The brickwork is cement rendered externally and incised with a ruled ashlar finish. The building's southern and eastern corners are elaborately decorated with rendered mouldings that include ornate window hood-mouldings, sculptural friezes, partly balustraded parapets and unusual shaped pediments. Sandstone steps lead up to the ground floor level arcades on both street frontages. The arcades are formed by a set of segmental arches carried by rendered piers supported by pedestals. Above the arcades are open verandahs that have intricately designed cast iron balcony columns and railings. Architectural plans, circa 1888 The original 1887 section of the building is roughly square in plan, with walls that are mainly of plaster-rendered brickwork. Some remnants of the original lath-and-plaster timber-framed interior partition walls survive on the upper floor level. Ceilings and soffits throughout the building are lined with beaded tongue & groove boarding; however a timber-framed dropped ceiling, sheeted in plasterboard has been introduced at ground level in some areas. Floors throughout the building are hardwood tongue and grooved boards that have been overlaid with carpet at the ground level and vinyl tiles at the upper level. Some original cedar doors and architraves have survived. Two fireplaces, formerly located on the building northern wall, have both been bricked up and their surrounds removed. At ground level the original building currently consists mainly of a corner vestibule and one large space, partly partitioned to create three small offices along the northern wall. Several openings in the original rear wall of the building provide access to the substantially altered former rear verandah area. As part of the alterations in this verandah area a strong room has been constructed with plaster-rendered brickwork, a reinforced concrete floor and ceiling, and a metal safe door. At the northern end of this area is the original cedar staircase, now painted, which leads to the upper floor. At the upper level there are several large rooms formed by the removal of most original partition walls. Male and female toilets have been introduced along the northern wall. All of the original cedar French doors at the upper level still survive, although they have been over painted. Adjacent to the 1887 section of the building is a two storeyed brick extension constructed in 1970. The structure, which faces Ballow Street, contains an extensive mail room, private mail box area and garage at ground level, and postman's setting up area and staff lunch area at the upper level. Large openings between the two parts of the building exist at both floor levels. The roof on the 1887 section of the post office is currently a single low gradient steel deck skillion that slopes from Ann Street down towards the rear of the section. The original chimney stacks have been removed. A second steel deck skillion of similar gradient exists over the later two storeyed section at the rear.  Heritage listing  The former Fortitude Valley Post Office was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 January 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Fortitude Valley Post Office, built in 1887, is important for its ability to demonstrate the evolution of post and telegraph services in Queensland and the development of Fortitude Valley, at a time of rapid trade, commerce, industry and residential expansion in the area. The grand style and scale of the building demonstrate the prosperity of Fortitude Valley at that time. The siting of the building at the corner of Ann and Ballow Streets is of interest for the controversy it caused between the government and the local residents and businesses who were preferable of the building being located closer to the business centre of Fortitude Valley. The post office is also of interest for the ancillary role it played in the distribution of social security payments of various kinds during the early 1900s, at which time it was claimed to be among the heaviest pensions paying centre in the Commonwealth. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The building is a rare example of a post office composed in the Victorian Italianate style, being one of only ten such buildings designed by the Colonial Architect's Office of the Department of Public Works in that architectural form. The Fortitude Valley Post Office is particularly unusual as the only post office in Queensland to be designed and constructed with mansard style roofs. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building's ornately detailed facade, regarded amongst the most elaborate of all post offices in Queensland, is of considerable aesthetic significance. The variety of mouldings, motifs and cast masonry decorations demonstrate a fine quality of workmanship. It is of interest as an example of a post office with a combined postmaster's residence. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building's ornately detailed facade, regarded amongst the most elaborate of all post offices in Queensland, is of considerable aesthetic significance. The variety of mouldings, motifs and cast masonry decorations demonstrate a fine quality of workmanship. The building remains as one of only a few substantial late nineteenth century buildings in Fortitude Valley, and its contribution to its surroundings is highly significant for demonstrating the character of the area at the turn of the century. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Fortitude Valley Post Office has a strong association with the general community of Fortitude Valley for the essential role it has played in the provision of essential postal and telecommunication services. The siting of the building at the corner of Ann and Ballow Streets is of interest for the controversy it caused between the government and the local residents and businesses who were preferable of the building being located closer to the business centre of Fortitude Valley.

This committee became one of the most popular in International Council of Museums (ICOM). It addresses the study of the theoretical foundation that guides museum activities around the world or, more generally, the analysis of the different forms that museums can have. The committee includes several hundred museologists from all over the world, organizes yearly symposia and publishes, among other monographs, the annual journal ICOFOM Study Series, available online.  Origins  The work of the International Council of Museums (ICOM), begun in 1946, was based on much older programmes, specifically professional symposia, journals of national associations (Museums Journal, Great Britain, 1902; Museumskunde, Germany, 1905), and of course the work of the International Office of Museums, founded in 1926 by the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, located in Paris. A large part of the research which grew out of these associations, as with international committees, focused on objectives relating to concrete professional concerns. In 1968 ICOM launched an international committee for the training of museum professionals (ICTOP)P. J. Boylan, \\"Museum training: a central concern of ICOM for forty years‚Äù. Museum, no. 156, 1987, pp. 225‚Äì230. at a time when museum training courses were gaining popularity, in particular in Brno, Czechoslovakia (1963), Leicester, UK (1966) and Paris (1970). On the other hand, the development of specific theories linked to the museum phenomenon ‚Äì long referred to as \\"museography\\", which became \\"museology\\" after WWII ‚Äì was not a research interest for most museum professionals. Nevertheless, this field was particularly interesting for some researchers and university professors, in particular in Eastern European countries, first of all Jan Jel√≠nek who was director of the Antropos Museum in Brno and president of ICOM. The International Committee for Museology was founded in 1977 at the General Conference of ICOM in Moscow. Its first president was Jan Jel√≠nek (Vino≈° Sofka succeeded him in 1981V. Sofka. My adventurous life with ICOFOM, museology, museologists and anti-museologists, giving special reference to ICOFOM Study Series, 1995, 32 p.). Since that date we can say that three generations of museologists have continued to pursue the work of ICOFOM.  Three generations of museologists  Museology was already developed in Eastern Europe at the time of the cold war. From the start ICOFOM would be a unique international platform that included researchers from both sides of the Iron Curtain, who were trying to set up museology as an autonomous discipline: without this independent status museology could not be taught in universities in Eastern countries, making this task a challenge of singular importance in the countries of the Warsaw Pact.T. ≈†ola, \\"What is museology?\\", Papers in Museology, 1, Stockholm, Almqvist & Wiksell International, 1992, pp. 10‚Äì19. The iconic personalities of museology, such as Georges Henri Rivi√®re, and especially Andr√© Desvall√©es in France, worked at the same time as influential museologists in the Eastern bloc, among whom are Avram Razgon (URSS), Klaus Schreiner (DDR), Ji≈ô√≠ Neustupn√Ω (Czechoslovakia), Josef Bene≈° (Czechoslovakia), Wojciech Gluzinski (Poland), and especially Zbynƒõk Str√°nsk√Ω (Czechoslovakia).F. Mairesse, Le mus√©e, temple spectaculaire, Lyon, 2002. The stated aim of ICOFOM, under the dynamic leadership of Vino≈° Sofka (Sweden), was to make an inventory of the different trends in museology throughout the world, and to develop this discipline in order to endow it with the status of science within the academic structure. At the beginning this essentially theoretical approach disconcerted many museum researchers who were much more pragmatic, for example George Ellis Burcaw, author of an influential manual on museum work in the United States.G. E. Burcaw, \\"Reflexions on MuWop no 1\\", MuWop/Do Tram, no. 2, 1981, pp. 83‚Äì84; G. E. Burcaw, Introduction to Museum Work, Nashville, American Association for State and Local History, 1983 (2nd ed.). Additionally, the climate of the cold war, which was still going on, did not help in creating closer links between the two sides. On the other hand, many researchers from Latin countries, in particular Waldisia RussioM. C. Oleveira Bruno, Waldisa R√∫ssio Camargo Guarnieri Textos e contextos de uma trajet√≥ria profissional, SƒÅo Paulo, ICOM/Pinacoteca, 2010, 2 vols. (Brazil), are especially attracted to this approach. Much enlarged new definitions of museology emerged, whose object of study reaches beyond the museum itself. The museum institution per se, the concept of museum as opposed to the specific museum, such as the Prado,is relatively recent, and what interests museologists is a specific attitude which led to the creation of museums, as well as cabinets of curiosity, or in the future new forms linked to digital technologies (Virtual museums): As already defined by the Czech museologist Anna Gregorov√° in 1980 \\"Museology is a science studying the specific relation of man to reality, consisting in purposeful and systematic collecting and conservation of selected inanimate material, mobile, and mainly three- dimensional objects documenting the development of nature and society\\" and \\"the museum is an institution which applies and carries out the specific relation of man to reality\\".A. Gr√©gorov√°, ‚ÄúMuseology, science or just practical museum work?‚Äù, MuWoP / DoTraM, no 1, 1980, pp. 20‚Äì21. From this point of view, which allowed for better describing the particular activity of selecting and describing an object in a museum ‚Äì a phenomenon not too far from a sacred act ‚Äì more specific concepts were developed, such as musealisation, a term used more in French and Spanish than in English, (the act of introducing an object into a museum context), and museality (the special value of the object which determines its musealisation).A. Desvall√©es, and F. Mairesse (Eds), Dictionnaire encyclop√©dique de mus√©ologie, Paris, Armand Colin, 2011. Zbynƒõk Str√°nsk√Ω, the Czech museologist, was of major importance in this development, through his involvement in ICOFOM and also through the International Summer School of Museology, which he founded in Brno in 1987.Z. Z. Stransk√Ω, Museology: Introduction to Studies, Brno, Masaryk University, 1995; Zbynek Z. Stransk√Ω, \\"Ten years of the International Summer School of Museology\\", in Zbynek Z. Stransk√Ω (Ed.), Museology for Tomorrow‚Äôs World, Munich, Verlag M√ºller-Straten (ISSOM Publications), 1997, pp. 143‚Äì151. Following this first generation of ICOFOM researchers, under the eight year presidency of Vino≈° Sofka, came a second, more diverse group of researchers. A leading member of this generation was Peter van Mensch (Netherlands), author of a 1992 doctoral thesis on museology as a scientific discipline: Towards a Methodology of Museology, who followed Sofka as President of ICOFOM. Other outstanding museologists in this generation were Ivo Maro√©viƒá (Croatia), Bernard Deloche and Mathilde Bellaigue (France), Martin Schaerer (Switzerland), as well as Teresa Scheiner (Brazil), Tomislav ≈†ola (Croatia) and Nelly Decarolis (Argentina). Alpha Oumar Konar√©, (Mali), who was particularly attentive to the development of new museology, had a remarkable career: he was elected President of ICOM in 1989, but did not renew his mandate when he became President of Mali in 1992.A. O. Konar√© \\"An exclusive Museum interview with Alpha Oumar Konar√©, the new President of ICOM‚Äù, Museum, no. 165, 1990, pp. 61‚Äì62. Broader definitions of the museum phenomenon began at this time, in particular one by Judith Spielbauer: ‚ÄúThe established museum is a means to an end, not the end itself. These ends have been stated in many ways. They include varying perspectives on broadening an individual‚Äôs perception of the interdependence of the social, aesthetic and natural worlds in which he lives by providing information and experience and fostering an understanding of self within this widening context. The increase and dissemination of knowledge, the improvement of the quality of life, and preservation for future generations are all included in the usual parades of rationales.‚ÄùJudith Spielbauer, 'Museums and Museology: a Means to Active Integrative Preservation', ICOFOM Study Series, no. 12, 1987, pp. 271‚Äì277. Other thinkers, such as Jennifer Harris and Kerstin Smeds, further expanded the definitions and added provocative nuances. A third generation, schooled in museology by the second one, gradually joined the work of researchers: in particular one can note Wanchen Chang (Taiwan) and Bruno Brulon Soares (Brazil). They all share a global vision of museology founded on critical thinking about the development of museums in the world and on the values that form the conditions for museum work. For the past thirty years the museum has undergone considerable changes, whether becoming more market oriented which has been the case in many countries, museums' relationship to collections, which is endlessly altered, and of course digital technologies whose development has transformed our way of seeing the world. In the light of this evolution of the museum world, it is important to understand and to prepare for the possible evolution of the museum itself.  Museology today and the work of ICOFOM  Today museology ‚Äì as seen by ICOFOM ‚Äì can be defined as \\"comprising all the efforts at theorization and critical thinking about the museum field\\". This vision, intentionally very broad, collects trends of thought that are often conflicting as they are linked to critical thinkers in different parts of the world, whether Benjamin Ives Gilman or Georges Brown Goode, John Cotton Dana or Joseph Veach Noble, and, more currently, Duncan F. Cameron, Neil Postman, Georges Henri Rivi√®re, Zbynƒõk Str√°nsk√Ω, Andr√© Desvall√©es, Stephen Weil or Roland Arpin. ICOFOM is harnessed to this work of research and synthesis, and strives to compile an inventory of the different ways to conceive of museums and museology and to generate, through these syntheses, the trends that emerge from the vast flux of change in the museum field. Within ICOFOM most working researchers teach at universities after having spent part of their career in a museum (or while continuing museum work at the same time). Presently there are about 700 members in the committee, of whom about 60% are from European countries and more than 20% live in Latin America. ICOFOM is known for its expansion into parts of the world where museums are rapidly developing. In this regard, Nelly Decarolis and Tereza Scheiner started and sustained a subcommittee, ICOFOM LAM, or ICOFOM Latin America. The great success of this subcommittee prompted the formation of ICOFOM ASPAC, ICOFOM Asia and the South Pacific, under the strong leadership of Olga Truevtseva and Hildegard Vieregg. Regional subcommittees such as these provide important support and training for those interested in the work of ICOFOM but who cannot always get to annual meetings. in distant parts of the world. Right from the start publications were a major part of ICOFOM activities. The first issues of Museological Working Papers, published in 1980 and 1981, were followed by ICOFOM Study Series (ISS) published annually, which comprise in all several thousand pages and are available on line at the ICOFOM site. In general, ISS publishes papers presented at the ICOFOM symposiums. In 2007, the ICOFOM editorial committee installed a double-blind peer review of papers submitted for publication. ICOFOM has also published syntheses of museology: What is a museum?,A. Davis, F. Mairesse, and Andr√© Desvall√©es, What is a Museum? Munich, Verlag M√ºller-Straten, 2011.

It was designed by Andrea Giovanni Stombuco and built from 1880 to 1882 by John Arthur Manis O'Keefe. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This stone Gothic-styled church was erected in 1880-1882, to accommodate the growing Catholic population in Fortitude Valley. It replaced an earlier St Patrick's, erected in Wickham Street, opposite Duncan Street, in 1861, one block from the residence of the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane, James O'Quinn. In the 1860s, Irish Catholics, brought to Queensland through the efforts of O'Quinn's Queensland Immigration Society, congregated in Fortitude Valley and adjacent suburbs. St Patrick's parish extended from Spring Hill, through Fortitude Valley to Newstead, Teneriffe and New Farm. By the late 1870s, the parish had outgrown the Wickham Street church. The new St Patrick's Church was one of the last of the substantial masonry ecclesiastical structures erected under Bishop O'Quinn's patronage, and was the largest church built during his occupancy of the Queensland Bishopric, 1861 to 1881, being at the time of greater seating capacity than St Stephen's Cathedral. O'Quinn transposed to Queensland, Ireland's Bishop Cullen's philosophy that new churches and ecclesiastical institutions should be expensive and Gothic, symbolising the new age of Irish Roman Catholicism. His successor, Robert Dunne (Bishop and later Archbishop of Brisbane 1882-1917), opposed such ostentatious displays, which had nearly bankrupted the Brisbane diocese. The Morgan Street site, occupied by Magill's Paragon Nursery in the 1870s, was acquired by church trustees, including Bishop O'Quinn, . In September that year, between 4,000 and 5,000 people gathered to watch the Bishop lay the foundation stone for the new church. Designed by architect and sculptor Andrea Giovanni Stombuco, the former Goulburn Diocesan Architect who reputedly was invited to Brisbane by Bishop O'Quinn, the church was to accommodate 1500 people. Tenders were called in October 1880, and the contract was let to Brisbane builder John Arthur Manis O'Keefe. Constructed of local porphyry and dressed with Murphys Creek sandstone, St Patrick's was completed in 1882 at an estimated cost of ¬£6,000. The tower, which was part of the original design, was not built. The church was consecrated on 3 December 1882, by Archbishop Dunne. Fittings included an organ constructed by local Brisbane musical instrument dealer and piano and organ builder, Thomas Christmas, at a cost of ¬£360. Christmas, who had arrived in Brisbane from Melbourne in 1877, was credited with having constructed most of the locally-made organs in Queensland by 1888. In 1886 a belfry and bell were erected in the grounds, on the highest point on the site. The bell of patent cast steel, manufactured by Vicker, Son & Co. Ltd of Sheffield, England, was a gift from Fortitude Valley parishioner Thomas Reedy. In 1886-1887 ornamental additions were made to the church. The high altar of New Zealand Oamaru stone, designed and reputedly sculpted by Stombuco, was completed. Also installed were a timber pulpit; side altars of Oamaru stone, sculpted by John Petrie & Son of Brisbane; and, in the eastern wall, a large stained glass window imported from Lyons in France. St Patrick's remained a large and important Irish Catholic parish until after the Second World War, despite the establishment of a separate New Farm parish . From the 1950s, however, Fortitude Valley declined as a residential area, and from this is dated the gradual withering away of a local congregation. At some period after the Second World War, possibly in the 1950s, the side altars and altar rails were replaced in marble, and marble flooring was laid in the chancel. By this time, the demographic composition of Fortitude Valley was changing, with substantial numbers of European migrants (principally Italian) congregating in Fortitude Valley/New Farm. Following the Vatican II resolutions of 1962, a new altar and sanctuary dais were installed in the middle of the church. A timber screen and doors just inside the main entrance have been removed. The 1886 belfry is no longer extant, but the original bell survives, housed in a steel structure. In 1955, buildings formerly associated with St Patrick's School (located previously in Wickham Street and then in Ivory Street), were erected in the church grounds, and in 1969, a presbytery. These buildings do not form part of the present entry in the Heritage Register. The parish of St Patrick's was dissolved , and the church is administered from St Stephen's Cathedral. It attracts a large Sunday Mass congregation from the wider Brisbane Catholic community, and is popular for weddings and baptisms.  Description  St Patricks Church is a substantial Gothic-influenced stone building centrally sited on an interior block accessed via Berwick and Morgan Streets. Only the north-eastern facade of the church is visible from the end of Morgan Street. The church has a monumental presence, with a simple rectangular form constructed in rough-axed porphyry. Its broad nave and aisles are expressed as three parapeted gables to the north-eastern principal elevation, following the line of three steeply pitched corrugated iron roofs. To the south-west, the nave extends past the aisles, forming a projecting chancel with a vestry attached in the south-western corner. The building has buttressed walls, and generous pointed arched windows and doors. The coursed rubble stonework is dressed with sandstone to the hood mouldings, cornice, crosses and window tracery. The window reveals are in rendered brickwork and are surmounted with alternating green and pink stone voussoirs. The church interior is impressive; the nave is separated from the aisles by octagonal columns supporting pointed arches. The nave is spanned by timber braced trusses with a king post and quatrefoil motifs to the haunches (the part of the arch between the top of the arch and the supporting pier); an ornamental timber fretwork truss/arch is centred over the chancel. Simpler scissor trusses run the length of the aisles. The diagonally boarded timber ceiling with exposed rafters is finished with a timber frieze with quatrefoil motifs. The side walls have diamond- glazed coloured-glass edged tracery windows, with smaller half-lights over the doors. Above the altar is a large stained glass window depicting the Resurrection of Jesus. The pointed arched doors are timber-framed and boarded. The chancel contains a richly carved Gothic-inspired Oamaru stone altar which sits on a stepped marble base bounded by a marble balustrade with brass gates. Less elaborate marble altars are located at the ends of the aisles. A stepped timber choir and organ loft is located at the other end of the church; it is supported by two colonnettes (thin columns), and is accessed by stone spiral stairs enclosed by a rendered brick wall. The loft balustrade is carved with quatrefoils, and has a continuous fretwork music stand at handrail level. The organ has richly carved timber surrounds. A timber-panelled reconciliation room is located to the north-eastern corner. The church also contains some fine furnishings including cedar pews decorated with gothic motifs and fretwork, a marble baptismal font, and an ornamental holy water stand. The grounds include a steel bell suspended from an approximately steel frame in the southern corner, a stone memorial in the centre of a circular drive to the north east, and several mature fig trees. The site also contains newer school buildings which link to the church via a walkway abutting the western vestry entrance. St Patricks is a fine intact stone church, containing well-crafted stained glass windows and carved elements in timber, Oamaru stone and marble.

Victory rolls are closely associated with the pin-up look and are achieved using hairspray and various backcombing, rolling, pinning, and curling techniques. The creator of the victory rolls is unknown, but several theories exist on the style's origins. The hairstyle has received a resurgence in popularity via themed parties and the swing dance scene.  History  Victory rolls were most popular during 1940 to 1945, during World War II. Some theories exist as to the style's origin, the most commonly repeated of which are linked with World War II and the postwar movements. One theory associates victory rolls with the aviation aerobatic maneuver of planes that would spin horizontally as a sign of victory or celebration, as the style was supposed to resemble the movements of the air crafts. Another associates it with the allies' victory over Germany, as it was symbolic of the women at home helping their loved ones fighting overseas. The style was popularized by film actresses such as Ingrid Bergman and the majority wore this style to frame their face so it fit the beauty standards of the day. The style could be worn with two victory rolls or with a single roll. After 1945 the popularity of the victory rolls declined as the style was now to have the top of the head smooth, however some women still wore victory rolls on the sides of their head. Victory rolls have experienced a resurgence in vintage-era theme parties and in the swing dance scene.  Style  To achieve a victory roll women would use hairspray and various techniques such as backcombing, rolling, pinning, and curling so that rolls would either sit on the top of their head or frame their faces, as a woman with a thinner face could wear her hair in front of her ears so it would look wider. Women with more disposable income would most likely go to the salon every day to get their hair done so they could achieve a shiny and slick look, whereas lower class women would have to do it themselves. Some women would also purchase wigs to avoid having to style their hair every day.

The four-winged castle encloses a courtyard including arcades and corner towers in late-baroque style. The complex also includes an original early Baroque church with post- gothic elements. Originally used as medieval farm estate, Schloss Weinzierl was expanded in baroque style by Johann Carl Weber von F√ºrnberg in the 18th century. A prominent guest that should become very important in music history was the then unknown artist Joseph Haydn, who received his first engagement at this place. Here he also composed his first string quartets around 1755. This tradition has been continuing so far by the annual music festival in Schloss Weinzierl. At the end of the 18th century, the estate came into Imperial Habsburg possession. In 1883 the so-called \\"Emperor Franz Joseph Asylum Association\\" created a home for orphans at Schloss Weinzierl.

History  The Uphagen house was purchased in 1775 by Johann Uphagen, a merchant, historian, art collector and city councilor. He remodeled it to suit the needs of a wealthy 18th century merchant. After Uphagen's death in 1802, the house was passed down through several generations of the Uphagen family. In 1911 the Uphagen house was converted into a museum, which it remained until 1944. In that year, German curators of the house evacuated the furniture to Kartuzy and Gorzƒôdziej. Though some parts of these interiors were destroyed at the end of World War II, some original parts returned in the early 1950s.

He was also a key part of the development of the National Security Management System (NSMS) under Prime Minister P.W. Botha and served as secretary of the State Security Council from 1988 to 1990.

As secretary of the SSC, he essentially drove the State Security apparatus on a day-to-day basis. He commanded Far North Command before handing over to Gen Georg Meiring in 1986. He was in overall command of Operation Protea.

She has lived most of her life in the small farming community of Waikuku in North Canterbury, near Pegasus Bay. Her physical environment has played a strong role in her art, providing the materials she works with: wool, river stones, bark, beach pebbles, shells and driftwood. Wilson began working with fibre in the early 1970s, and started breeding sheep (specifically English Leicester) to achieve the quality and kind of wool she wanted to work with. In 1974 she was included in the 12 Weavers exhibition at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. In the 1990s Wilson moved back to sculptural work, creating installations from natural materials. Early in her life Wilson began 'wandering around and picking things up', and the items she collects in this way make their way into her art. A work like Untitled No. 10, a large container woven from elm bark filled with orderly rows of stones, shell, driftwood and seaweed in the Christchurch Art Gallery collection, shows how Wilson brings the natural environment into the gallery space.

The reversal of Jupiter's migration is likened to the path of a sailboat changing directions (tacking) as it travels against the wind. The planetesimal disk is truncated at 1.0 AU by Jupiter's migration, limiting the material available to form Mars. Jupiter twice crosses the asteroid belt, scattering asteroids outward then inward. The resulting asteroid belt has a small mass, a wide range of inclinations and eccentricities, and a population originating from both inside and outside Jupiter's original orbit. Debris produced by collisions among planetesimals swept ahead of Jupiter may have driven an early generation of planets into the Sun. Description In the grand tack hypothesis Jupiter underwent a two-phase migration after its formation, migrating inward to 1.5 AU before reversing course and migrating outward. Jupiter's formation took place near the ice line, at roughly 3.5 AU. After clearing a gap in the gas disk Jupiter underwent type II migration, moving slowly toward the Sun with the gas disk. If uninterrupted, this migration would have left Jupiter in a close orbit around the Sun like recently discovered hot Jupiters in other planetary systems. Saturn also migrated toward the Sun, but being smaller it migrated faster, undergoing either type I migration or runaway migration. Saturn converged on Jupiter and was captured in a 2:3 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter during this migration. An overlapping gap in the gas disk then formed around Jupiter and Saturn, altering the balance of forces on these planets which began migrating together. Saturn partially cleared its part of the gap reducing the torque exerted on Jupiter by the outer disk. The net torque on the planets then became positive, with the torques generated by the inner Lindblad resonances exceeding those from the outer disk, and the planets began to migrate outward. The outward migration was able to continue because interactions between the planets allowed gas to stream through the gap. The gas exchanged angular momentum with the planets during its passage, adding to the positive balance of torques; and transferred mass from the outer disk to the inner disk, allowing the planets to migrate outward relative to the disk. The transfer of gas to the inner disk also slowed the reduction of the inner disk's mass relative to the outer disk as it accreted onto the Sun, which otherwise would weaken the inner torque, ending the planets' outward migration. In the grand tack hypothesis this process is assumed to have reversed the inward migration of the planets when Jupiter is at 1.5 AU. The outward migration of Jupiter and Saturn continued until they reached a zero-torque configuration within a flared disk, or the gas disk dissipated, and is supposed to end with Jupiter near its current orbit. Scope of the grand tack hypothesis The hypothesis can be applied to multiple phenomena in the Solar System. Mars problem Jupiter's grand tack resolves the Mars problem by limiting the material available to form Mars. The Mars problem is a conflict between some simulations of the formation of the terrestrial planets which end with a 0.5‚Äì1.0 Earth-mass planet in its region, much larger than the actual mass of Mars: 0.107 Earth-mass, when begun with planetesimals distributed throughout the inner Solar System. Jupiter's inward migration alters this distribution of material, driving planetesimals inward to form a narrow dense band with a mix of materials inside 1.0 AU, and leaves the Mars region largely empty. Planetary embryos quickly form in the narrow band. Most of these embryos collide and merge to form the larger terrestrial planets (Venus and Earth) over a period of 60 to 130 million years. Others are scattered outside the band where they are deprived of additional material, slowing their growth, and form the lower-mass terrestrial planets Mars and Mercury. Asteroid belt Jupiter and Saturn drive most asteroids from their initial orbits during their migrations, leaving behind an excited remnant derived from both inside and outside Jupiter's original location. Before Jupiter's migrations the surrounding regions contained asteroids which varied in composition with their distance from the Sun. Rocky asteroids dominated the inner region, while more primitive and icy asteroids dominated the outer region beyond the ice line. As Jupiter and Saturn migrate inward, ~15% of the inner asteroids are scattered outward onto orbits beyond Saturn. After reversing course, Jupiter and Saturn first encounter these objects, scattering about 0.5% of the original population back inward onto stable orbits. Later, as Jupiter and Saturn migrate into the outer region, about 0.5% of the primitive asteroids are scattered onto orbits in the outer asteroid belt. The encounters with Jupiter and Saturn leave many of the captured asteroids with large eccentricities and inclinations. These may be reduced during the giant planet instability described in the Nice model so that the eccentricity distribution resembles that of the current asteroid belt. Some of the icy asteroids are also left in orbits crossing the region where the terrestrial planets later formed, allowing water to be delivered to the accreting planets as when the icy asteroids collide with them. Absent super-Earths The absence of close orbiting super-Earths in the Solar System may also be the result of Jupiter's inward migration. As Jupiter migrates inward, planetesimals are captured in its mean-motion resonances, causing their orbits to shrink and their eccentricities to grow. A collisional cascade follows as the planetesimals relative velocities became large enough to produce catastrophic impacts. The resulting debris then spirals inward toward the Sun due to drag from the gas disk. If there were super-Earths in the early Solar System, they would have caught much of this debris in resonances and could have been driven into the Sun as the debris spiraled inward. The current terrestrial planets would then form from planetesimals left behind when Jupiter reversed course. However, the migration of close orbiting super-Earths into the Sun could be avoided if the debris coalesced into larger objects, reducing gas drag; and if the protoplanetary disk had an inner cavity, their inward migration could be halted near its edge. If no planets had yet formed in the inner Solar System, the destruction of the larger bodies during the collisional cascade could have left the remaining debris small enough to be pushed outward by the solar wind, which would have been much stronger during the early Solar System, leaving little to form planets inside Mercury's orbit. Later developments Simulations of the formation of the terrestrial planets using models of the protoplanetary disk that include viscous heating and the migration of the planetary embryos indicate that Jupiter's migration may have reversed at 2.0 AU. In simulations the eccentricities of the embryos are excited by perturbations from Jupiter. As these eccentricities are damped by the denser gas disk of recent models, the semi-major axes of the embryos shrink, shifting the peak density of solids inward. For simulations with Jupiter's migration reversing at 1.5 AU, this resulted in the largest terrestrial planet forming near Venus's orbit rather than at Earth's orbit. Simulations that instead reversed Jupiter's migration at 2.0 AU yielded a closer match to the current Solar System. When the fragmentation due to hit and run collisions are included in simulations with an early instability the orbits of the terrestrial planets are better produced. The larger numbers of small bodies resulting from these collisions reduce the eccentricities and inclinations of the growing planets orbits via additional collisions and dynamical friction. This also results in a larger fraction of the terrestrial planets mass being concentrated in Venus and Earth and extends their formation times relative to that of Mars. The migration of the giant planets through the asteroid belt creates a spike in impact velocities that could result in the formation of CB chondrites. CB chondrites are metal rich carbonaceous chondrites containing iron/nickel nodules that formed from the crystallization of impact melts 4.8 ¬±0.3 Myrs after the first solids. The vaporization of these metals requires impacts of greater that 18 km/s, well beyond the maximum of 12.2 km/s in standard accretion models. Jupiter's migration across the asteroid belt increases the eccentricities and inclinations of the asteroids, resulting in a 0.5 Myr period of impact velocities sufficient to vaporize metals. If the formation of CB chondrites was due to Jupiter's migration it would have occurred 4.5-5 Myrs after the formation of the Solar System. The presence of a thick atmosphere around Titan and its absence around Ganymede and Callisto may be due to the timing of their formation relative to the grand tack. If Ganymede and Callisto formed before the grand tack their atmospheres would have been lost as Jupiter moved closer to the Sun. However, for Titan to avoid Type I migration into Saturn, and for Titan's atmosphere to survive, it must have formed after the grand tack. Encounters with other embryos could destabilize a disk orbiting Mars reducing the mass of moons that form around Mars. After Mars is scattered from the annulus by encounters with other planets it continues to have encounters with other objects until the planets clear material from the inner Solar System. While these encounters enable the orbit of Mars to become decoupled from the other planets and remain on a stable orbit, they can also perturb the disk of material from which the moons of Mars form. These perturbations cause material to escape from the orbit of Mars or to impact on its surface reducing the mass of the disk resulting in the formation of smaller moons. Potential problems Most of the accretion of Mars must have taken place outside the narrow annulus of material formed by the grand tack if Mars has a different composition than Earth and Venus. The planets that grow in the annulus created by the grand tack end with similar compositions. If the grand tack occurred early, while the embryo that became Mars was relatively small, a Mars with a differing composition could form if it was instead scattered outward then inward like the asteroids. The chance of this occurring is roughly 2%. Later studies have shown that the convergent orbital migration of Jupiter and Saturn in the fading solar nebula is unlikely to establish a 3:2 mean-motion resonance. Instead of supporting a faster runaway migration, nebula conditions lead to a slower migration of Saturn and its capture in a 2:1 mean-motion resonance. Capture of Jupiter and Saturn in the 2:1 mean-motion resonance does not typically reverse the direction of migration, but particular nebula configurations have been identified that may drive outward migration. These configurations, however, tend to excite Jupiter's and Saturn's orbital eccentricity to values between two and three times as large as their actual values. Also, if the temperature and viscosity of the gas allow Saturn to produce a deeper gap, the resulting net torque can again become negative, resulting in the inward migration of the system. The grand tack scenario ignores the ongoing accretion of gas on both Jupiter and Saturn. In fact, to drive outward migration and move the planets to the proximity of their current orbits, the solar nebula had to contain a sufficiently large reservoir of gas around the orbits of the two planets. However, this gas would provide a source for accretion, which would affect the growth of Jupiter and Saturn and their mass ratio. The type of nebula density required for capture in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance is especially dangerous for the survival of the two planets, because it can lead to significant mass growth and ensuing planet-planet scattering. But conditions leading to 2:1 mean-motion resonant systems may also put the planets at danger. Accretion of gas on both planets also tends to reduce the supply toward the inner disk, lowering the accretion rate toward the Sun. This process works to deplete somewhat the disk interior to Jupiter's orbit, weakening the torques on Jupiter arising from inner Lindblad resonances and potentially ending the planets' outward migration. Alternatives Multiple hypotheses have been offered to explain the small mass of Mars. A small Mars may have been a low probability event as it occurs in a small, but non-zero, fraction of simulations that begin with planetesimals distributed across the entire inner Solar System. A small Mars could be the result of its region having been largely empty due to solid material drifting farther inward before the planetesimals formed. Most of the mass could also have been removed from the Mars region before it formed if the giant planet instability described in the Nice model occurred early. If most of the growth of planetesimals and embryos into terrestrial planets was due to pebble accretion, a small Mars could be the result this process having been less efficient with increasing distances from the Sun. Sweeping secular resonances during the clearing of the gas disk could also excite inclinations and eccentricities, increasing relative velocities so that collisions resulted in fragmentation instead of accretion. A number of these hypotheses could also explain the low mass of the asteroid belt. A number of hypotheses have also been proposed to explain the orbital eccentricities and inclinations of the asteroids and the low mass of the asteroid belt. If the region of the asteroid belt was initially empty due to few planetesimals forming there it could have been populated by icy planetesimals that were scattered inward during Jupiter's and Saturn's gas accretion, and by stony asteroids that were scattered outward by the forming terrestrial planets. The inward scattered icy planetesimals could also deliver water to the terrestrial region. An initially low-mass asteroid belt could have had its orbital eccentricities and inclinations excited by secular resonances if the resonant orbits of Jupiter and Saturn became chaotic before the instability of the Nice model. The eccentricities and inclinations of the asteroid could also be excited during the giant planet instability, reaching the observed levels if it lasted for a few hundred thousand years. Gravitational interactions between the asteroids and embryos in an initially massive asteroid belt would enhance these effects by altering the asteroids semi-major axes, driving many asteroids into unstable orbits where they were removed due to interactions with the planets, resulting in the loss of more than 99% of its mass. Secular resonance sweeping during the dissipation of the gas disk could have excited the orbits of the asteroids and removed many as they spiraled toward the Sun due to gas drag after their eccentricities were excited. Several hypotheses have also been offered for the lack of close orbiting super-Earth and the small mass of Mercury. If Jupiter's core formed close to the Sun, its outward migration across the inner Solar System could have pushed material outward in its resonances, leaving the region inside Venus's orbit depleted. In a protoplanetary disk that was evolving via a disk wind, planetary embryos could have migrated outward before merging to form planets, leaving the Solar System without planets inside Mercury's orbit. An early generation of inner planets could have been lost due to catastrophic collisions during an instability, resulting in the debris being ground small enough to be lost due to Poynting-Robertson drag. If planetesimal formation only occurred early, the inner edge of the planetesimal disk might have been located at the silicate condensation line at this time. The formation of planetesimals closer than Mercury's orbit may have required that the magnetic field of the star be aligned with the rotation of the disk, enabling the depletion of the gas so that solid to gas ratios reached values sufficient for streaming instabilities to occur. The formation of super-Earths may require a higher flux of inward drifting pebbles than occurred in the early Solar System.

He then attended Durham University graduating BSc and then receiving a doctorate (PhD) in 1934. Fothergill worked in the Department of Botany and Genetics at King's College, Newcastle. From 1953 he worked as a senior university lecturer in botany. He wrote scientific papers on mycology and experimental cytology. He was a Roman Catholic.\\"Philip G. Fothergill\\". The Tablet. In 1955 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were George Heslop-Harrison, John Heslop-Harrison, Alexander Milne and William Fisher Cassie. He died on 24 June 1967. Works Historical Aspects of Organic Evolution Fothergill is most well known for his book Historical Aspects of Organic Evolution (1952) which was widely reviewed. The book traced the development of evolution from 600 B. C. to the twentieth century and cited 750 references to original sources.MacConaill, Michael A. (1952). Evolution and Enthusiasm. Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review. Vol. 41, No. 163/164. pp. 355-361. The biologist James H. Birnie praised the book commenting \\"it is obvious that the author has kept his personal opinions in the background and has considered the data without bias.\\"Birnie, James H. (1954). Growth of a Theory. Phylon (1940-1956). Vol. 15, No. 2. p. 219. The philosopher Lawrence Haworth also gave it a positive review stating \\"the author approaches his subject with an admirable impartiality. The result is a competent survey of evolutionary theory which will be intelligible to the interested layman.\\"Haworth, Lawrence. (1955). Historical Aspects of Organic Evolution by Philip G. Fothergill. Philosophy of Science. Vol. 22, No. 3. p. 237. Criticism came from the botanist Conway Zirkle who commented in a 1954 review \\"there is no evidence presented [that] the author has understood or digested the great advances made in evolutionary theory during the past twenty years.\\" Fothergill had supported the neo-Lamarckian experiments of Paul Kammerer but according to Zirkle they had been discredited.Zirkle, Conway. (1954). Historical Aspects of Organic Evolution by Philip G. Fothergill. Isis. Vol. 45, No. 1. pp. 103-105. The geneticist H. Bentley Glass heavily criticized the book for \\"being biased by both the author's inclination to Lamarckism, and by his religious views.\\" Glass wrote that the book was too uncritically accepting of Lamarckism, orthogenesis and John Christopher Willis' age and area hypothesis whilst ignoring evidence of their refutation.Glass, Bentley. (1955). Historical Aspects of Organic Evolution by Philip G. Fothergill. The Quarterly Review of Biology. Vol. 30, No. 4. pp. 376-377. The biologist Ernst Mayr wrote that the \\"book suffers from an overzealous belief in the inheritance of acquired characters [but] is most useful for a sympathetic account of neo-Lamarckians.\\"Mayr, Ernst. (1998). The Evolutionary Synthesis: Perspectives on the Unification of Biology. Harvard University Press. p. 403. Evolution and Christians Fothergill also wrote Evolution and Christians (1961) which examined the bearing of evolutionary biology on the Roman Catholic faith and doctrine. It also documented the history of evolution from the Greeks to Mendel, modern evolutionary theories and hominid paleontology. The book received a positive review from John C. Green who noted \\"The evidences of evolution are marshalled in a clear and orderly fashion, with abundant reference to the scientific literature. Controversial issues are handled with balance and judgment; every effort is made to present conflicting views impartially.\\"Green, John C. (1963). Evolution and Christians by Philip G. Fothergill. Isis. Vol. 54, No. 1. pp. 148-150. In the second half of the book, Fothergill proposed possible biological explanations for Adam and Eve involving ordinary methods of sexual reproduction. He proposed that Adam was born from pre-hominid parents and was the father of Eve or they were both fraternal twins.Smith, J. Maynard. (1961). All about Eve? Evolution and Christians by P. G.

Przewodnik historyczny, Bydgoszcz 2003 The design of \\"Kaufhaus Conitzer & S√∂hne\\" was inspired by contemporary department stores which were then thriving in Germany, in particular the \\"Wertheim\\" department stores established in the early 1900s in Berlin, Stralsund, and Breslau by Georg Wertheim and designed by the German architect Alfred Messel. The \\"Kaufhaus Conitzer & S√∂hne\\", which opened on October 4, 1911, was the first department store in the West Prussian-Polish territory that introduced the concept of a new way of trading supported by large commercial buildings. Such department stores appeared in Germany in 1894, in the early 20th century in Berlin. At its opening, \\"Kaufhaus Conitzer & S√∂hne\\" offered a wide and varied range of goods including: the ground floor: silk, linen & cotton articles, clothing, aprons, knitwear, wool, gloves, stockings, umbrellas, haberdashery, lace, linen goods and handicrafts; the first floor: wardrobe hats and shoes for men and boys; the second floor: garments for ladies and girls (dresses, blouses, skirts, dressing gowns, corsets and accessories), and furs; the third floor: carpets, curtains, fabrics, furniture, quilts, blankets, rugs, linoleum, leather, beds, mattresses; and the fourth floor: work rooms and studios consisting of dressmaking, underwears and d√©cor. Second Polish Republic|Interwar period During Poland's interwar period, the department store was known as Be-De-Te for \\"Bydgoski Dom Towarowy\\" (). Bydgoszcz company's profits in 1938 ranked second among the largest department stores in the Poland. \\"Be-De-Te\\" was then famous for its fashion shows. On the second floor there was a cafe. World War II Passing years changed the appearance of the building. A fire in 1945 kindled by Red Army soldiers destroyed many sections of the edifice: the building lost a sloping roof with round windows. In 1947, the owner PSS Spo≈Çem made the necessary repairs and modifications which allowed the building to house offices and warehouses.Puzowska Iwona: Bydgoskie domy towarowe z poczƒÖtku XX w. [w.] Kronika Bydgoska X (1986-1988). Towarzystwo Mi≈Ço≈õnik√≥w Miasta Bydgoszczy. Bydgoszcz 1990 Since 1949 In 1949, the building was taken over by the state General Department Store, restoring its commercial function. In the 1960s, its name was changed to \\"Department Stores Center\\" (), and during the years 1978-1979 the building was refurbished. The label Jedynak (\\"only child\\") stood on the roof of the building for around 40 years, before it was removed in 2000. In 2009, the new owner of the building, Centrum Development and Investments from Warsaw, developed a plan to modernize and restore the facility to revive the commercial activity, in close coordination with conservators. In 2012, a facade renovation was performed, which re- exposed statues and reliefs which were originally part of the decor. Architecture The building was erected in modernist style, alluding to the style of department stores constructed in the German Empire or Paris. At this time in Bydgoszcz , the \\"Kaufhaus Conitzer & S√∂hne\\" building pioneered the use of reinforced concrete in a modern design. The facade, rhythmically fragmented with pilaster strips, has a majestic entrance onto Gdanska street: it is topped by an ostentatious portico with a pediment surmounted by sculptures inspired by the art of antiquity and depicting allegorical female figures: including Aphrodite - the goddess of beauty and love; Eris - the goddess of discord; Hera - the mother of the gods; and Athena - the goddess of wisdom and war. Intriguing decorative motives stand on the main facade include: a Greek amphora with dangling vine shoots and vases; theatrical masks (tragic and comic); and animal figures (a sleeping cat, a sitting monkey, an owl protecting its two cubs). The angled corner is decorated with a number of references to Dionysus. On the pediment of the ground floor window, the image of Silenus can be found, and above, on each of the slender columns stand 2 sculptures: a boy playing the flute, with winegrapes hanging on the hips; and a child holding basket of fruit with a bird under his arm. Interiors The building has a large atrium covered with a glass roof. The ceilings are supported by columns and the four levels are giving onto the atrium, receiving directly natural light. Travel between stories from the ground floor to the fourth floor is made by elevator and stairs, which are smartly separated in 3 different stairways. The interior department store displays simplicity and functionality. The absence of stucco decoration gave to the interior grace and elegance. The building was registered on the Pomeranian Heritage List (N¬∞601296-reg.87/A) on 10 December 1971.

It was established in 1906 and is named after Stuart Mitford Fraser (1864-1963), who was the tutor and guardian of Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, Maharaja of Mysore. Fraser Town was established to de-congest the growing Bangalore Civil and Military Station (otherwise known as the Bangalore Cantonment). The foundation of Fraser Town was laid in August 1910 by Mrs. F J Richards, with a commemorative plaque on the corner of Coles Road and Mosque Road . Fraser Town is a residential and commercial suburb, the prominent roads being Promenade Road, Netaji Road, Madhavraya Mudaliar Road (M M Road), Haines Road, Spencer Road, Wheeler Road, Mosque Road, etc. The suburb is known for its communal harmony with Hindus, Muslims and Christians living side by side in peace. Before being known as Fraser Town, the suburb was called Mootocherry by the locals. In 1988, the BBMP renamed Fraser Town as Pulakeshinagar, after an ancient King who ruled the Deccan. However, the name has not caught on and continues to be popularly known as Fraser Town. Coles Park Coles Park (corruption of Cole's Park) is one of the popular parks in Fraser Town, located West of St. John's Hill, enclosed Promenade Road, Haines Road, Kemp Road, St. John's Church Road and Saunders Road. Coles Park is named after Arthur Henry Cole (1780-1844), British Resident of Mysore (1809, 1812), who went on to become the Member of Parliament on return to Ireland, representing Enniskillen between 1828-1844. Arthur Henry Cole paid an important role in getting the support of the Maharaja of Mysore for the construction of St. Bartholomew's Church in Mysore. Covering an areas an area of 27,280m2, Coles Park was established in 1914. Coles Park was once in its peak of glory with a bandstand and 3 tennis courts. The Band of the Bangalore Rifle Volunteers, played at the bandstand every first Saturday of the month. YWCA used to run of the tennis courts. The park is fairly maintained, even though there is some encroachments. Coles Park is officially known as the Freedom Fighters Park, however still popularly known by its former name. The Park is open between 5AM to 11PM, but the Nursery is closed except during the Lalbagh Flower Show. The Madras Sappers Regiment has a memorial for fallen Indian soldiers in various conflicts, including the Kargil Conflict. The Wesleyan Tamil Mission was established in Bangalore by Rev. Elijah Hoole and James Mowatt in April 1821, in the location where the Goodwill's Girls School and the Wesley English Church is presently located, North of Coles Park. Elijah Hoole in his book Personal Narrative of a Mission to the South of India, from 1820 to 1828 acknowledges the help rendered by the British Resident in Mysore, Arthur Henry Cole, in getting the support of the Maharaja of Mysore (p. 73, 74, 84, 85, 86, 207). People and culture Like in other suburbs of the Bangalore Cantonment, Fraser Town has a large Kannada population. They trace their ancestry to the large number of native kannadigas Fraser Town along with other suburbs of the Bangalore Cantonment was directly under the administration of the British Madras Presidency till 1949, when it was handed over to the Mysore State. Fraser Town is home to a large Christian population, dating back to the days of the British Raj. Majority of the Christians were converted from Tamil speaking Hindus in the 19th Century, and have contributed towards building the Bangalore Cantonment. Economically well off Muslims of the Bangalore Cantonment prefer to live in Fraser Town. The suburb serves as an best example for unity in diversity. Hindus and Christians do not play loud music or cause disturbance during the time of breaking the Roza (fast) during the Muslim Holy month of Ramzan. Muslims also reciprocate by co-operating and during the St. Marys's Feast (observed by Christians and Hindus of the Cantonment), and Christmas Celebrations Cartoonist Paul Fernandes, who has a studio aPaulogy - Gallery of Curious Memories in the neighbouring suburb of Richards Town, has paintings depicting of the life in Fraser Town, and Bangalore Cantonment in general.

Characteristics affected include internode length and stem structure as well as leaf form, size and arrangement. It should not be confused with seasonal heterophylly, where early and late growth in a season are markedly different. This change is different from a homoblastic change which is a gradual change or little change at all so that there is little difference between the juvenile and adult stages. Some characteristics affected by heteroblastic change include internode length and stem structure as well as leaf form, size and arrangement. Heteroblasty is found in many different Families as well as different species within a genus, this random spread of heteroblastic plants across species is believed to be caused by convergent evolution. Heteroblasty should not be confused with seasonal heterophylly, where early and late growth in a growing season are markedly different. The earlier and later stages of development are commonly labeled as juvenile and adult respectively, particularly in relation to leaves. The term was coined by German botanist Karl Ritter von Goebel, along with homoblasty for plants with leaf characteristics that do not change significantly. Leonard Cockayne observed that heteroblasty occurred in an unusually high proportion of tree species native to New Zealand.  Origins  There are two ways to look at how heteroblasty developed. The first is to look at the evolution of heteroblasty, and the second is to consider the ecological interactions of heteroblastic plants.  Evolution Many hypothesize that heteroblasty is a result of natural selection for species that can best survive in both low and high light environments. As a plant grows in the forest it experiences predictable changes in light intensity. With this in mind a plant that changes its leaf morphology and phyllotaxy to best suit these changes in light intensity could be more competitive than one that has only on leaf form and phyllotaxy. It is also hypothesized that the development of heteroblastic trees preceded the development of divaricating shrub forms which are now very common in New Zealand. It is thought that these shrubs are a mutation from the heteroblastic trees and have lost the ability to develop into the adult stage and so are very similar to heteroblastic trees in their juvenile form. It has also been observed that heteroblastic species do not stem from a single point of origin they are found in many different and unrelated species, because of this it is believed that large-scale convergence evolution had to have occurred for so many unrelated plants to exhibit similar behavior.  Ecology Heteroblasty can affect all parts of the plant but the leaves are the most common examples and by far the most studied. It has been hypothesized that the heteroblastic changes are due to changes in the plant's exposure to sun because many species spend their juvenile years in the understory then grow to maturity where they are a part of the top canopy and so have full exposure to the sun. This has not been well studied because the common heteroblastic plants are woody and take so long to grow such as Eucalyptus grandis. The juvenile plants tend to face more competition and must make special adaptations to succeed that are then unnecessary as a mature plant. For example, a sampling in a dense forest must grow quickly to succeed at first but once it has established itself most woody plants no longer compete severely with their neighbor and so the adaptations needed as a juvenile plant are no longer necessary. This can lead to a change in growth in maturity as the tree faces new environmental factors. Such as a need to resist new pathogens or parasites.  Mechanism  At the cellular level, there are different ways that a plant controls its growth and development. There are internal and external signals that result in a change in the plant's response. The plants also have genetic predetermined growth patterns.  Signaling  Hormones are known to regulate heteroblastic change in plants. One hormone that has been identified is gibberellin. In a study, it was used to spontaneously revert the mature form of Hedera helix (a common English ivy) to its juvenile form. After being sprayed with gibberellin acid some of the ivies began to produce aerial roots which are a characteristic of the juvenile form as well as three lobed leaves another characteristic. It is also hypothesized that auxin and cytokinin when working together can cause the sudden change in phyllotaxy of heterogenetic plants. The gene ABPH1 has been found to code for cytokinin and when changed in a mutant affected the plant's ability to regulate the phyllotaxy of the stem. The hypothesis is based mostly on studies done on non-heteroblastic plants and so it is not certain that these are the cause of the sudden changes in a heteroblastic plant. A dramatic change in leaf size is another example of a heteroblastic change in plants and researchers have looked to studies done on non-heteroblastic plants for answers about what hormones and genes could regulate these changes. Aintegumenta has been found to be one of these regulatory genes that regulated cell growth. It is believed that many genes are involved in the regulation of leaf size and these genes do not closely interact meaning they are not caused by a master regulator but instead are a part of many different pathways. Genetics The most common model plants are Arabidopsis thaliana (common name: mouse-ear cress), Antirrhinum majus (common name: snapdragon), and Zea mays (common name: corn). None of these are helpful in the study of gene expression in heteroblastic plants because none of them express obvious heteroblastic traits. Researchers in this area of study can use Arabidopsis to some degree for study as it does undergo some change form the juvenile phase to the mature phase but it is not clearly heteroblastic. If we assume the process of change is similar and uses similar regulations we can use Arabidopsis to analyze the causes of change in plant growth that may be occurring in the same way but more dramatically in heteroblastic plants and so can only be used to analyze heteroblastic changes. This involves many assumptions though and so researchers are seeking other plants to use as model subjects. The problem with this is that most plants that display heteroblastic growth are woody plants. Their life spans are much longer in general and unlike Arabidopsis very little of their genomes are known or mapped. A species that shows promise is Eucalyptus grandis. This tree is grown commonly because of its many uses for teas, oils, and wood. The tree overall is fast growing and widely grown due to its many uses and so is one of the best candidates for genome sequencing, which is being done now so that the tree can be better studied in the future. There is already a complete quantitative trait loci map for the juvenile traits.  Examples  These plants are a few of the common examples of heteroblastic plants often found in studies and is far from an all-encompassing list. All listed are plants because they are the only organisms that have been found to undergo this growth change it is absent in animals, fungi, and microbes as far as is known to this point. #Lightwood (Acacia implexa) is a fast wood tree found in Australia #Spiral Ginger (Costus pulverulentus C.Presl) is an herb found in South America found primarily in Nicaragua and is used as a traditional medicine in teas for pain and inflammation. It is also used to treat cancer. #Lance Wood (Pseudopanax crassifolius) is a native of New Zealand #P≈çkƒÅkƒÅ (Elaeocarpus hookerianus) native to New Zealand #Bucket-of-Water tree, of Maple Leaf (Carpodetus serratus) native to New Zealand  Geographic distribution  This is a list of places heteroblastic plants have been commonly found and documented but not a complete list of all places as heteroblastic plants can be hard to identify and do not appear in families predictably. *New Zealand has a very large population of heteroblastic plants with about 200 tree species and 10% of the woody shrubs species having heteroblastic tendencies. *Australia also has heteroblastic species though the exact amount is not known. *South America also has a few heteroblastic plants, specifically known in Mexico, and Nicaragua.  Similar processes  Processes often confused with heteroblasty include: # Homoblasty is the first example of this. To understand Heteroblasty you must first understand that homoblasty is different. Homoblastic change is the slight change a plant experiences over a long period of time as it grows to maturity. Examples of this are a plants leaves growing slightly larger over time as it matures or a trees trunk growing in girth. #Heterophylly is another term that is often used interchangeably with Heteroblasty. The process of heterophylly refers to specific changes in leaf morphology that lead to variation in leaf shape or size on a single plant. This type of change is seen when you study the individual leaves and compare them, this is different than homoblasty in which the entire foliage changes dramatically but for the most part uniformly. A heteroblastic plant can have heterophyllic changes but they are not the same. #Phenotypic Plasticity changes the structure of plants as well but should not be confused with Heteroblasty. Phenotypic plasticity is when an individual can use the same genes to create a different phenotype based on environmental signals. Such as when a plant is adapting its immune system to a new pathogen or when a reptile changes its sex based on environmental queues. The difference here is that Heteroblasty is not entirely dependent on the environment, though it can be affected by it, and happens throughout the plant's maturity instead of at random points because of an environmental change.

He is generally counted as the sixty-first in the list of 63 Nayanars. While the first part of his name can be spelt as Tirunilakanta, Tirunilakantha, Tiru Neelakanta, Tiru Nilakanta, Nilakantan and Thiruneelakanda, Yazhpanar is spelt as variously as Yalppanar, Yalapannar, Yalpanar and Yazhpaanar. He is described as a companion of Sambandar (first half of the 7th century CE), one of the most prominent Nayanars. Life The life of Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar is described in the Tamil Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar was born in Erukattanpuliyur in the Chola kingdom. He belonged to the Tamil Panar community of wandering musicians. He was a staunch devotee of the god Shiva, the patron god of Shaivism. An maestro of the Yazh (a lute), he used to travel to various temples, as the bard of Shiva. However, as a travelling minstrel of a low caste, he was allowed to enter the temples and sang and played hymns to Shiva on the yazh, outside the entrance of the shrine. The name \\"Yazh-panar\\" denotes his job as the panar player of the yazh. Once, Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar reached Madurai, which was ruled by the Pandyas. As usual, he sang and played the yazh outside the entrance of the Tiru-aalavai temple. In a dream, Shiva ordered the Brahmin priests to bring him inside the shrine as he wanted to listen to Yazhpanar's yazh. The Brahmins brought him to the garbhagriha (sanctum sanatorium) of the temple. A heavenly voice suggested that the Nayanar be a given a golden seat, so that the yazh is not placed on the wet temple floor. As ordered, a golden seat was presented to the Nayanar, who stood on it and sang the Lord's glories, playing his yazh. Yazhpanar went to Thiruvarur and played the yazh outside the Thyagaraja Temple there. Thyagaraja, the presiding form of Shiva at Thiruvarur invited him in through the northern entrance, which the god opened for him. The Nayanar entered and played the yazh for Shiva. Yazhpanar continued his journeys and visited many shrines. He finally reached Sirkazhi, home of the Sattainathar Temple and met the young Sambandar. The child saint requested Yazhpanar to play the yazh; the sonorous music won Sambanar's favour. Impressed by Sambandar's devotion, Yazhpanar asked him permission to accompany him and set tune to Sambadar's hymns to Shiva. Sambandar consented. Yazhpanar and his wife Mandangasulamani (described as virali or songstress) accompanied the young saint on his travels. The couple sang Sambandar's hymns and Yazhpanar composed music for the hymns on his yazh. Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar travelled with Sambandar (pictured) and set music to many of the latter's hymns to Shiva. Sambanar and Yazhpanar once travelled to the Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram, where they saw the Brahmin priests of Chidambaram as ganas, attendants of Shiva and bowed to them, as the priests bowed to the Nayanars. The duo also visited Yazhpanar's home-town, Erukattanpuliyur and numerous other shrines of Shiva. At Dharmapuram, the duo went to meet Yazhpanar's mother. The people of Dharmapuram praised Yazhpanar's music, but Yazhpanar credited Sambandar's hymns. Ultimately, Sambandar composed an hymn devoted to Shiva's son Ganesha, which Yazhpanar could not play on the yazh to his satisfaction. The frustrated yazh player decided to break his yazh, but was stopped by the lyricist, who said the musical composition was good enough and Yazhpanar should be content with it. Yazhpanar accompanied Sambanar on his journeys and meetings with other Nayanars like Tiruneelanakka Nayanar, Siruthondar, Muruga Nayanar, Kungiliya Kalaya Nayanar, Appar, the Pandya king Koon Pandiyan, the queen Mangayarkkarasiyar and Kulachirai Nayanar. On a visit to the Brahmin Nayanar Tiruneelanakka, the caste-conscious host was uneasy inviting the Shudra (low-caste) couple of Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar and his wife home. After insistence by Sambanar, the host gave them place to sleep near the homa kunda, the fire altar used for sacrifices. The fire of homa kunda shone brightly in the night, giving testimony to the couple's devotion. After many pilgrimages, Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar and his wife returned to their home-town. After a while, Sambandar invited Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar to his wedding in Thirumana Nallur (presently known as Achalpuram). After the wedding, Sambandar, his bride and the wedding party went the Shivaloka Thyagar temple of Shiva, in Thirumana Nallur. Sambandar prayed to Shiva, seeking salvation. Shiva appeared as a blazing flame and granted his wish. Then Sambandar, his bride and all the wedding guests, including Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar merged in the Light of Shiva. Remembrance The images of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. One of the most prominent Nayanars, Sundarar (8th century) venerates Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar in the Tiruthonda Thogai, a hymn to Nayanar saints, calling him the Tirunilakantan, the Panar player of the yazh. Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar is worshipped in the Tamil month of Vaikasi, when the moon enters the Mula nakshatra (lunar mansion). He is depicted with a crown and folded hands (see Anjali mudra), and with the yazh or another lute in the crook of his arm. He receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars. Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Their images are taken out in procession in festivals. Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar was the first to set music to the songs of a Nayanar and set a \\"precedent for musical performance of the Tevaram hymns\\". The Tevaram by Nambiyandar Nambi (11th century) compiles the hymns of Sambandar, Appar and Sundarar. However, the music of the Tevaram was lost, until Nambiyandar Nambi reached Tiru Nilakanta Yazhpanar's home-town to recover it. A Panar woman is said to have revealed it to him, which she got to know by a \\"divine revelation\\".

History The inter- island Faial-Pico route is the most active in the Azores, no matter the meteorological conditions The ferry was constructed by Estaleiros S√£o Jacinto, of Aveiro, in 1987, under contract from the Regional Government of the Azores. The ship, and its sister-ship, were constructed to replace the lower-capacity launches used until that time, specifically the motor-launches Espalamaca and Calheta, that were decommissioned and sent to the shipyards of Madalena. Cruzeiro do Canal was originally inaugurated as the Cruzeiro das Ilhas, and entered into service in the waters of the archipelago on 7 July 1987. In January 1988 it began operating for Transma√ßor, in order to service the vital Horta-Madalena, cross-channel route. Later life In June 2006, during his visit to S√£o Jorge, then-Regional Secretary for Economy () Vasco Cordeiro announced that the government of the Azores would invest 40 million Euros for the purchase of ships to enter into service in the archipelago. The government wanted to purchase four ships: two smaller vessels to substitute the aging Cruzeiro das Ilhas and Cruzeiro do Canal; of these one would be permanently docked in Velas (to maintain the S√£o Roque-Horta line) and the other in the port of Horta (to secure the vital Horta-Pico route), both ships would have a length and capacity for 300 passengers, in addition to space for 15 vehicles. The two remaining vessels in the tender were larger ferries, to secure the longer, inter-island routes between the islands. Owing to the age of the Cruzeiro do Canal and her sister-ship and persistent technical and/or mechanical problems, CDS-PP leader Artur Lima addressed parliament, noting: :\\"...we continue to follow the investments of the Regional Government of hundreds-of-thousands of Euros in successive and unnecessary repairs to the ships Cruzeiro do Canal and Cruzeiro das Ilhas, boats with a long history to tell, but whose thirty years do not guarantee an auspicious future..\\". In fact, after three-and-a-half months of repairs, the Cruzeiro do Canal returned to active service in Christmas 2010, after several tests and certification of navigability from IPTM. Until that time, Cruzeiro das Ilhas continued the half-hour trip between Madalena and Horta. Eventually, Cruzeiro do Canal accompanied the arrival of its replacement ferry Gilberto Mariano from the Port of Madalena, on its arrival in the Central Group on 17 December 2013, at 11:00 a.m. The ship, while still commissioned, is used on intermittent and irregular service, in support of the newer vessels Gilberto Mariano and Mestre Sim√µes.

Torday was 59 when the book was published. It is based on his extensive experiences of industry and government, as well as his personal interests in salmon fishing and the Middle East. Satirical themes in the novel focus on the 2000s Labour government of Tony Blair and its foreign policy dilemmas. The novel won the 2007 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for Comic Fiction and the 2007 Waverton Good Read Award. It was also shortlisted for the Newcomer of the Year Award at the 2008 Galaxy British Book Awards.  Summary  Dr Alfred Jones is a civil servant at the National Centre for Fisheries Excellence. A shy, academic type, he is not attuned to the increasingly dull lovelessness of his marriage and why his chilly financier wife Mary has seized the chance to work abroad. When a rich Yemeni sheikh and angling enthusiast, Muhammad ibn Zaidi bani Tihama, offers to fund a scheme to populate the desert wadis of his country with Scottish salmon, Jones initially dismisses it as impossible and preposterous. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office is, however, keen to spend the sheikh's money. Jay Vent, the prime minister, and Patrick Maxwell, his spin doctor, are eager to lend support any positive Middle East initiative while Vent's prosecution of two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are ongoing disasters. The scheme picks up momentum and Dr Jones is the only character who knows how it might actually be achieved. The story is delivered in the form of a series of letters, e-mails, interview transcripts, newspaper articles and other non-narrative media. They range from fishing magazine editorials and entries in Hansard to exchanges between al- Qaeda operatives.  Film adaptation  A screenplay adaptation of the novel was written by Simon Beaufoy and produced by Lionsgate and BBC Films. The film, rendered as a romantic comedy, starred Ewan McGregor as Dr Alfred Jones and Emily Blunt as Harriet Chetwode-Talbot. The government's spin doctor, Patrick Maxwell, was gender-swapped for Patricia Maxwell, portrayed by Kristin Scott Thomas. Torday was particularly amused by the fact that, shortly after the film's release, British holidaymakers made enquiries to Yemeni tourism organisations asking about their real-life non-existent salmon fishing industry.

In January 2014, ISIL took control of Fallujah and Ramadi, inciting conflict with the Iraqi Army. On 4 June, the insurgents began their efforts to capture Mosul. The Iraqi army had 30,000 soldiers and another 30,000 federal police stationed in the city, facing a 1,500-member attacking force. However, after six days of fighting, the city, Mosul International Airport, and the helicopters located there all fell under ISIL's control. An estimated 500,000 civilians fled from the city, due to the conflict. Iraqi forces initiated an offensive on October 17, 2016, to retake the city, succeeding in their efforts in late July 2017. Background Since December 2013, ongoing clashes have occurred between tribal militias, Iraqi security forces, and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) throughout western Iraq. In early January 2014, ISIL militants successfully captured the cities of Fallujah and Hƒ´t, bringing much of Al Anbar Governorate under their control. The Iraqi Army then began conducting an offensive into Anbar, in an attempt to bring the region back under government control. Iraqi forces recaptured Samarra on 5 June 2014, and also heavily shelled Fallujah to weaken the ISIL forces there. However, ISIL had made territorial advances in neighboring Syria, giving them access to more weapons and substantially strengthening their position. In early June, following the Iraqi Army's campaign in the Anbar region, insurgents began advancing into the central and northern parts of Iraq. During the advancement, Iraqi security forces killed ISIL military chief Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi on 4 June near Mosul. ISIL named the military operation that resulted in their seizure of Mosul, \\"Bilawi Vengeance\\", a reference to their late commander's alias. Just before the operation began, insurgents still controlled most of Fallujah and Garmah, as well as parts of Haditha, Jurf Al Sakhar, Anah, Qa'im, Abu Ghraib, and several smaller settlements in the Anbar Province. Fall of Mosul US Army diagram of the fall of Mosul On 4 June, Iraqi police, under the command of Lieutenant General Mahdi Gharawi, cornered ISIL military leader Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi near Mosul, in Iraq. Al-Bilawi blew himself up, and Gharawi hoped it would prevent an attack. At 02:30 in morning, ISIL convoys of pickup trucks, each truck carrying four fighters, entered Mosul by shooting at the city's checkpoints. Though Mosul's first line of defense was thought to contain 2,500 soldiers, Gharawi says that \\"reality was closer to 500\\". He noted that since all of the city's tanks were being used by Iraqi forces in Al Anbar Governorate, the city was left with little to combat the ISIL fighters. The insurgents hanged, burned, and crucified some Iraqi soldiers during their attack. On 5 June, a curfew was imposed in the city. The government used helicopters to bomb the militants. In the southern part of the city, five suicide bombers blasted an arsenal. On 6 June ISIL began their attack on the northwestern part of the city. The ISIL forces in the city totaled 1,500 militants, outnumbered by Iraqi forces by more than 15 to 1. Two suicide bomber cars exploded, in Muwaffakiya, a village near Mosul, killing six Sabak soldiers. After the attacks, most of the fighters either retreated into the desert or camouflaged among the local population. On 8 June, the group launched a double bomb attack against a Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party office in Jalula, in which eighteen people died. That day, about a hundred vehicles entered Mosul, carrying at least four hundred men. Sleeper cells hidden within the city were then activated and according to police, \\"neighbourhoods rallied to them\\". Assassinations carried out by the sleeper cells left Mosul leaderless.Five Hostages, The New Yorker The group also bombed a police station in the neighborhood of al-Uraybi, and commandeered an abandoned building on the west of Tigris River, transforming it into a headquarters for a group of thirty SWAT members. On 9 June, ISIL executed fifteen Iraqi security force members who were captured in Tikrit. According to CBS News, ISIL fighters armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades stormed the Nineveh provincial headquarters that same day. By that time, the Fourth Battalion were among the very last local police fighting the attackers, the rest of the defense forces having run away or joined the opposition. Lacking plans and ammunition, Gharawi ordered the Iraqi military to retreat on the advice of retired general Khaled al-Obeidi. On that same night, ISIL and Sunni militants attacked Mosul, causing heavy fighting overnight. Iraqi Army soldiers fled the city while it was under attack, allowing the militants to control much of Mosul by midday on 10 June. The militants seized numerous facilities, including Mosul International Airport, which had served as a hub for the U.S. military in the region. Militants captured the helicopters present at the airport, in addition to \\"several villages\\" and a military airbase in south Saladin Governorate. The Iraqi army \\"crumbled in the face of the militant assault\\", which is evidenced by the fact that soldiers abandoned their weapons and dressed as civilians to blend in with the noncombatants. The city fell to the ISIL on 10 June 2014 after four days of clashes between the insurgents and the Iraqi military. There were reports that the group was advancing from Mosul to Kirkuk at the time. While capturing the city, the group freed nearly 1,000 prisoners, some of whom were greeted by the fighters. Black flags were also flown over government buildings. Aftermath ISIL control and activity in Syria and Iraq by May 2015 On 11 June, ISIL insurgents entered the oil refinery town of Baiji, seizing and setting its main courthouse and police station on fire. The militants, who were travelling in a group of around 60 vehicles, also took control of the Baiji prison and freed all the inmates within. Local residents told members of the media that ISIL sent a group of local tribal chiefs ahead of them, trying to convince the 250 guards at the oil plant to withdraw. Soldiers and police were also warned to leave the area. Al Jazeera claimed that later that day, militants retreated from Baiji after reinforcements from the Iraqi Army's Fourth Armored Division arrived in the city. That day, ISIL members also seized the Turkish consulate in Mosul, kidnapping 49 Turkish employees, including the Consul General, three children, and several members of the Turkish Special Forces. Reports suggested that the abducted were taken to a nearby militant base and were unharmed. An unnamed Turkish official confirmed that the government was in contact with ISIL. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan held an emergency meeting with members of the National Intelligence Agency (MIT) and Deputy Prime Minister Be≈üir Atalay to discuss the situation. The attack came a day after 28 Turkish truck drivers were abducted by militants while delivering fuel to a power plant in Mosul. After seizing control of Mosul, ISIL forces executed an estimated 4,000 Iraqi Security Force prisoners, and dumped their bodies in the single largest known mass grave in Iraq, at the \\"Khafsa Sinkhole.\\" This mass grave was later uncovered during the Battle of Mosul (2016‚Äì17).Horror of Mosul where sinkhole became mass grave for 4,000 of Isil's victims Insurgents took full control of Tikrit on the evening of 11 June. Local officials reported that checkpoints had been set up around the city, and that at least 300 inmates had been freed from the city's prisons, many of them serving sentences under terrorism charges. In response to the Fall of Mosul and its aftermath, the Iraqi government said that it would arm its civilians and its parliament would declare a state of emergency. The government also spoke of a plan to reorganize its military, involving a collaboration between tribal people and the U.S. military. Response United States of America: The U.S. State Department said that it was \\"deeply concerned\\" and that it felt that the situation was \\"extremely serious\\". The State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, \\"This growing threat exemplifies the need for Iraqis from all communities to work together to confront this common enemy and isolate these militant groups from the broader population\\". Republic of Iraq: Usama al- Nujayfi, a speaker of the Parliament, who hails from Mosul said that \\"what happened is a disaster by any standard\\". He also criticized the \\"negligence\\" of the army as they withdrew from the city. Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al- Maliki, also asked for \\"help\\" from \\"friendly governments\\". A Mosul-based businessman commented that the \\"city fell like a plane without an engine\\" as \\"they were firing their weapons into the air, but no one was shooting at them\\". One officer told Reuters that \\"they [ISIL militants] appear, strike and disappear in seconds\\".

During this stage of awakening the aspirant gives up all hankering after sensual objects. The seven stages of wisdom that characterize a Jivanmukta were mentioned by Ribhu to his son, NidƒÅgha, in the Varahu Upanishad, which stages are ‚Äì a) Shubhecha ('good desire or intention'), b) Vicharana ('enquiry and contemplation'), c) Tanumanasi ('the mind rid of hankering after objects'), d) Sattvapatti ('the purified Chit resting on the Atman'), e) Asamsakti ('perfect non-attachment to objects'), f) Padartha-bhavana ('analysis of objects or love for objects'), g) Turiyattita ('superconsciouness' or moksha). With the first three stages working amidst differences and non-differences in the waking state the aspirant i.e. the seeker after Truth, is called Mumukshu. The first three stages or bhumikas viz; the good intention to pursue the right path, the investigation into ways and means required for gain of knowledge, and the attenuation of the mind, are under the Jagrat ('waking') state when awake one sees the universe and assumes it to be really existent; the third stage is also called Asanga-bhavana in which stage if death occurs the human being is re-born on earth as a jnani ('wise person') after spending a longer time in the heaven.

He was Senior Medical Officer and one of the original explorers of the Bahr-el-Ghazal region in what is now South Sudan, instrumental in containing a cholera pandemic in Alexandria in 1902, and later Inspector of the Bahr el Ghazal. Early life Henry Evered Haymes was born on 17 March 1872, the third son of the Rev. Robert Evered Haymes. He was educated at Bedford Modern School, Oxford Military College and St Thomas's Hospital where he qualified as MRCS and LRCP in 1896. He was subsequently appointed House physician at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Berkshire and, prior to entering the Royal Army Medical Corps, was Resident Medical Officer at the Eastern Counties Asylum in Colchester. Military life Haymes entered the Royal Army Medical Corps on 28 January 1899 with a commission as Lieutenant, initially based at Netley where he attended to returning wounded soldiers from the South African War. He later joined the Egyptian Army at Khartoum (September 1899) where he looked after the wounded from battles in the Upper Sudan for which he was awarded the Khedive's Sudan Medal. Toward the end of 1900, and as its Senior Medical Officer, Haymes joined an exploration party into the ‚Äòvirtually unknown Bahr- el-Gazal region under Miralai Sparkes Bey. The party consisted of five British officers and two British sergeants, 11 Egyptian officers, an interpreter, a clerk, 84 regulars, 266 irregulars and 216 wives and children. They also took 100 men and women rescued from slavery in Omdurman to be returned to their native tribes‚Äô. On 29 November 1900 the Bahr-el-Gazal exploration party left Khartoum on three steamers heading south along the White Nile. Having crossed Lake No the steamers entered the Bahr-el-Ghazal river ‚Äòwhich was spread out in a vast area of virtually impassable swamps covered by tall papyrus and thick vegetation, swarming with crocodile and hippopotami‚Äô. The party ‚Äòpushed on down the river to Mashra-el-Rek, where Sparkes took Haymes and a detachment of soldiers to the Tueng river, about 120 miles and an eight-day hike away‚Äô. The village of Gor Ghattas was reached on New Year's Eve in 1900 and the British and Egyptian flags were raised ‚Äòto the tune of the Khedival March‚Äô. The party spent a year exploring the region attempting to assert government authority on the Dinka, Shulluk and Jur tribes and travelling further down the Bahr-el- Ghazal river to towns and villages as far south as the border with the Belgian Congo. Having established themselves in the province, the party was joined by further men and supplies helping to clear river routes, encourage trade and endeavouring to prevent slave trading, cattle rustling and general disputes between tribes. Sparkes Bey contracted a fever at Waw whereupon it was decided to return to Khartoum by steamer. As a reward for his role in the exploration party in Bahr-el-Ghazal, Haymes was awarded the clasp ‚ÄòBahr-el-Ghazal 1900‚Äì1902‚Äô for his Khedives Sudan Medal. Haymes was promoted to Captain and later in 1902 travelled to Alexandria where he ably helped control the cholera pandemic, which had claimed the lives of 35,000 people, and ‚Äòdid important sanitary medical work‚Äô. This was ‚Äòthe first attempt to fight a pandemic using modern thinking and techniques and shortly afterwards the outbreak was contained‚Äô. Haymes returned to the Sudan where he was selected by the Sirdar, Reginald Wingate (later Sir Reginald Wingate Bt GCB GCVO GBE KCMG DSO), for the appointment of Inspector of the Bahr-el-Ghazal Province. He ‚Äòspent a year doing valuable work in surveying and boundary delimitation‚Äô and also took up Big Game Hunting sending specimens of rarer animals back home to the British Museum. He was admitted to the Venerable Order of St John as a Serving Brother in 1901 and awarded the Order of the Medjidie (4th Class) in 1902. Durham University, Catalogue of the Papers (1899‚Äì1904) of H.E. Haymes The Nyam Nyam ambush In February 1904, as Principal Medical Officer and Staff Officer, Haymes joined ‚Äòa patrol of 100 men (with two Maxim machine guns) in an attempt to reopen negotiations with Chief Yambio‚Äô and avenge the murder of a British officer, Captain Scott-Barbour. As the patrol: ‚Äòapproached Rikta‚Äôs village gunfire was suddenly opened up on them at a few yards range and almost simultaneously a number of spear and bowmen lying concealed in the Khor, charged the government troops. The result was hand-to-hand melee, from which the Nyam Nyam rapidly withdrew into the high grass with which the surrounding country was covered. The Maxims were quickly brought into action, and cleared the enemy from the high grass which was as soon as possible burnt. Bimbashi Haymes had received a dangerous gunshot wound in the head and one man of the XV Sudanese had been killed, whilst nine others were wounded, mostly by spears and arrows. The Nyam Nyam, who are said to have numbered about 50, left behind six dead‚Äô. Haymes died of his head wounds at Tonj on 15 March 1904, just two days before his thirty-second birthday.

It is named for Causey Pike, where the fault was first recognised. Extent The Causey Pike Fault has been recognised across the entire outcrop of the Lake District inlier, extending about 35 km from near Ennerdale Bridge in the west, to near Troutbeck in the east. A possible continuation of the fault to the east has been recognised in the Cross Fell inlier, where it also juxtaposes two differing parts of the Skiddaw Group. Recognition It juxtaposes two successions dominated by mudrocks that are of similar age. To the north of the fault, the Ordovician Skiddaw Group is represented by the Kirk Stile Formation, to the south by the Buttermere Formation, both of Arenig age. The younger sequence of volcanic rocks overlying the Skiddaw Group also differs, with the Eycott Volcanic Group to the north and the Borrowdale Volcanic Group to the south. The fault is described as a thrust near Causey Pike, where rocks of the Crummock Water Aureole are emplaced over sandstone olistoliths of the Buttermere Formation, but the overall displacement on this structure is oblique, with a significant component of sinistral (left lateral) strike-slip motion. Age of movement The differences in stratigraphy and interpreted depositional environment across the fault may indicate that the fault was originally a normal fault, active during deposition of the Skiddaw Group. The oblique slip movement on the fault occurred during the Acadian Orogeny, at least in part postdating the contact metamorphism that caused the development of the Crummock Water Aureole (dated to about 401 Ma - Emsian), which itself postdates the formation of the regional cleavage seen within the Skiddaw Group.

The naturally-aspirated versions of the R06A feature variable valve timing (VVT) on both the intake and exhaust valves (the first Suzuki engine to do so), and VVT on the intake valves of the turbocharged models. For 2012, Suzuki added the naturally-aspirated version of the engine to the Alto's range, with R06A-equipped Altos being called the Alto Eco. The Wagon R also received both forms of the R06A engine in 2012, to coincide with the release of the fifth- generation model.

As a result of it, the presidency of Mauricio Macri requested a loan from the International Monetary Fund. Background The presidency of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner ended in 2015, and the new president Mauricio Macri sought to change many of the abnormal aspects of the economy of Argentina left behind by Kirchner. The Central Bank of Argentina's reserves were depleted; inflation was over 30 percent, although the widely discredited National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina (INDEC) provided a lower figure. The country had the highest tax rates in history, but the government budget balance had an eight-percent deficit. There had been a sovereign default since 2001, and a conflict existed with hedge funds. Tight currency controls had been in place since 2011. Since Argentina is a developing country, a global drop in commodity prices reduced trade revenue. One of Macri's first economic policies was the removal of currency controls, allowing Argentinians to freely buy and sell foreign currencies. Argentina has had a floating exchange rate since then, with intervention from its central bank, and the Argentine peso was devalued by 30 percent. Another early policy was the removal of export quotas and tariffs on corn and wheat. Tariffs on soybeans, Argentina's most lucrative export, were reduced from 35 to 30 percent. He also ended the national default. This measures did not lower unemployment neither inflation, and growth was still weak. However, the modest economic recovery was enough to allow a victory at the 2017 midterm elections, surpassing Kirchner in the Buenos Aires province by a wide margin. Growing problems Inflation continued to be a problem, with a rate of 25% in 2017, second only to Venezuela in South America and the highest rate in the G20. On December 28, the Central Bank of Argentina together with the Treasury announced a change of the inflation target. This was seen by the market as a relaxation of the monetary policy. The Central Bank attempted to reduce it to 15%, but these efforts failed. In 2018, the economy took a turn for the worse. The international trade, which had a surplus in the previous year, gave a deficit. A drought reduced the production of soy, the country's principal export, ranking among the world's worst natural disasters in 2018. The Federal Reserve of the United States increased interest rates from 0.25% to 1.75% and then 2%. This caused investors to return to the United States, leaving emerging markets. The effect, a raise in the price of the United States dollar, was modest in most countries, but it was felt particularly strongly in Argentina, Brazil and Turkey. Those factors led to a dramatic increase of the price of the US dollar in Argentina. The Central Bank increased the interest rate to 60%, but could not keep the price low. Despite the high interest rates and the IMF support, investors feared that the country might fall into a sovereign default once again. IMF loan Macri announced on May 8 that Argentina would seek a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The initial loan was $50bn, and the country pledged to reduce inflation and public spending. Federico Sturzenegger, the president of the Central Bank of Argentina, resigned a week later, alongside much of its senior staff. Macri replaced him with Luis Caputo, and merged the ministries of treasury and finances into a single ministry, led by Nicol√°s Dujovne. The Turkish currency and debt crisis caused yet another increase on the price of the dollar. The tariffs on soy exports were restored, as a result of the crisis. Caputo resigned for personal reasons, and Guido Sandleris was appointed as president of the Central Bank. The IMF expanded the loan with an extra 7 billion U.S. dollars, the largest loan in IMF history. In exchange, the Central Bank would operate on the price of the dollar only when it surpassed certain requirements. The national budget for 2019 reduced the deficit, which was a 2.6 percent of GDP in 2018, to zero, and estimated that inflation would decrease from 44% to 23%. This budget was approved by the Congress, despite of demonstrations and Kirchnerist rejection. In late 2019, a Kirchnerist government was elected again. The new government has refused to take the remaining $11 billion of the loan, which means that it is not obliged to adhere to the IMF conditions.

More recently, Fergusson moved over to Blizzard Entertainment to oversee development on the Diablo series. Career Early years and Microsoft (1996-2005) Fergusson grew up in Ontario, Canada, and while he had an interest in video games, he thought the industry was too far out of reach for him, though he had programmed his own multi-user dungeon (MUD). Fergusson started his career in 1996 at Microsoft, initially as part of its consulting services providing technical support to enterprise customers with Microsoft Solutions Framework before moving into the Redmond campus directly. While there, an opening at Microsoft Game Studios under Shannon Loftis opened up, which Fergusson was able to get. He joined Microsoft's internal simulations group, later renamed to Aces Game Studio, where one of the first projects he worked on was Microsoft Train Simulator alongside Kuju Entertainment. With the release of the first Xbox console in 2002, Fergusson also worked with Stormfront Studios to help finish Blood Wake as a launch title for the console. After a few months exploring a possible new internal studio within Microsoft, Fergusson returned to a producer role to help bring Valve's Counter-Strike to the Xbox, as the project at Ritual Entertainment was behind schedule. He helped to bring the multiplayer game to the Xbox by 2003, and assisted in setting pace for the single-player Counter-Strike: Condition Zero to be completed by 2003, though ultimately, Valve dropped much of Ritual's work and had the single-player game reworked by Turtle Rock Studios. Epic Games (2005-2012) Between 2003 and 2005, Fergusson worked on two unannounced titles within Microsoft. In early 2005, Fergusson was introduced to the upcoming Gears of War from Epic Games, targeted for Microsoft's new Xbox 360 console. Fergusson described the state of the game as being \\"on fire\\" and well behind schedule, which he attributed to Epic having only one producer at the time, splitting duties between Gears and Unreal Tournament 3. Fergusson discussed the situation with Microsoft where it was determined the best route would be for him to quit Microsoft and join Epic in a full-time capacity to help get Gears back on track, and by July 2005, Fergusson was working at Epic as an executive producer and helping to get the game ready for release over the next 18 months. Eventually Fergusson became director of production, participating in development for the entire Gears of War series. While at Epic, Fergusson also helped with some of its other projects, including Bulletstorm which was also a similarly-troubled project as it neared its release window. Another project at Epic that Fergusson helped with was the mobile game series Infinity Blade that was conceived by Donald Mustard of Epic's subsidiary Chair Entertainment. While Fergusson had partially helped with the design, he \\"[didn't] get mobile\\" and games that focused on endless repetition of gameplay. Around 2012, Epic began discussions with Tencent Holdings as the company wanted to get into the mobile and free-to-play market, an area Tencent had great experience in. In June 2012, Tencent invested into Epic Games as to obtain a 40% minority ownership of the company, but which Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said would not affect the creative output of Epic Games. Irrational Games (2012-2013) Fergusson, believing that this investment by Tencent would move Epic away from the type of \\"AAA, big-narrative, big- story, big-impact game\\" he preferred working on, left Epic and on August 9, 2012, joined Irrational Games as executive vice president of development during the final stretch of development of BioShock Infinite. Following BioShock Infinite release in March 2013, Fergusson announced his plans to depart Irrational that April, though had not confirmed where he would go next and was remaining there for a few months to help on transition. Fergusson said \\"I am very proud of the work that I did and of the team and what they were able to accomplish on Infinite. Now with the game shipped successfully, I've done what I set out to do here and now I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my life and career.\\" Fergusson later said in a 2020 interview that the short period he had spent at Irrational validated the concept that he was a good \\"closer\\", someone capable of helping to complete a troubled project to get it released on time, and for which had begun to get an industry reputation for. Fergusson said that he found himself enjoying helping to close out the development cycle of games. In September 2013, Fergusson had been tapped to lead an upcoming new studio under 2K Games (Irrational's parent) in the San Francisco area. Fergusson later identified this studio as Hangar 13 and had been working on Mafia III. He decided to leave due to having creative differences with the senior management at 2K. Black Tusk/The Coalition (2014-2020) During 2013, Microsoft began talking with Epic about acquiring the Gears of War franchise with plans to assign it to Black Tusk Studios. Fergusson heard of this and contacted Microsoft, eager to work on the series again. Microsoft affirmed the acquisition on January 27, 2014, and confirmed Fergusson would be hired into a leadership position at Black Tusk Studios. Fergusson said \\"I've been privileged to work on a lot of great games with a lot of great teams, but Gears has had the most impact on me professionally and personally, so this really feels like a homecoming.\\" Fergusson also state that he felt that with Microsoft's resources, they would do much more with the series than at Epic. Black Tusk was later renamed to The Coalition (based on a fictional entity within the Gears series) in June 2015. Over the next three years, Fergusson helped lead development on the remastered version of the first Gears game and the fourth and fifth entry in the series. The last two games shifted the main character and setting for the game, which Fergusson said was meant to be comparable to the contrast between Tim Burton's and Christopher Nolan's Batman films. Blizzard (2020- )  Fergusson left the Coalition in February 2020, moving over to Blizzard Entertainment to oversee development of the Diablo series.

An international bestseller, it was the focus of a publishers' bidding war at the 2013 London Book Fair. Set in Amsterdam in 1686‚Äì87, the novel was inspired by Petronella Oortman's doll's house on display at the Rijksmuseum. It does not otherwise attempt to be a biographical novel. Plot Petronella (Nella) Oortman, an 18-year-old country girl of an old impoverished family, from the beautiful Dutch countryside village of Assendelft, arrives at the Golden Bend home in Amsterdam of the wealthy merchant Johannes Brandt, whom she married a month earlier. She steps into a house of secrets held by Brandt's ascetic sister Marin, the servants Cornelia and Otto, and Brandt himself, who treats her more like a friend than a wife. Brandt gives her as a wedding present of a doll's house designed to look like their nine-room home in miniature, and she engages the services of a local miniaturist to add realistic furnishings to it. The miniaturist, whom she never meets, begins sending her lifelike dolls and furnishings that are eerily accurate and even seem to predict the future. As a web of danger gradually ensnares the characters, Nella wonders if everyone's fate lies in the miniaturist's hands.  History  The doll's house that inspired the novel Burton, who had studied English literature at the University of Oxford before embarking on an acting career, wrote the novel over a period of four years while supporting herself as an actress and PA in the City of London. She came up with the idea while on holiday in Amsterdam, where she viewed Petronella Oortman's doll house at the Rijksmuseum, and undertook extensive research on 17th-century Amsterdam, studying books, cookbooks, Dutch Golden Age paintings, maps, and wills. She trimmed the word count from 120,000 words to 80,000 words after participating in a creative writing course in 2011 and to better match the marketing target readership. The novel was the focus of a publishers' bidding war at the 2013 London Book Fair. Of the 11 publishers that vied for the book, Picador won the UK and British Commonwealth rights for a reported six-figure sum. The UK cover design is a photograph of an actual miniature doll's house commissioned by Picador, which reflects characters and elements in the novel. Publication history By 2016, the book had sold over 1 million copies in 37 countries. Reception While applauding the tone and setting of the novel, some reviews cited the shallowness of the characterizations. The Guardian and Chicago Tribune reviews observe that Nella is drawn more like a worldly, feminist 21st-century girl than a na√Øve 17th-century one. The Chicago Tribune adds: \\"[The main characters are] complex and complicated and suffer terrible tragedies, but Burton doesn't give us a deep enough look into their psyches. I'd read 100 additional pages just to get inside Johannes' head\\".

Its primary service area is the University, Minneapolis community. The library was one of thirteen branch libraries established under the leadership of Gratia Countryman, the chief librarian of the Minneapolis Public Library from 1904 to 1936. The library is named after women's rights advocate and political campaigner Arvonne Fraser. East Side Branch, 1891‚Äì1904 The third branch of the Minneapolis Public library opened on November 1, 1891 in the old Winthrop School building at 22 University Avenue Southeast. It was replaced by the Pillsbury Library in 1904. Pillsbury Library, 1904‚Äì1967 The Pillsbury Library replaced the East Side Branch (1891-1904) as part of the Minneapolis Public Library system from 1904-1967. John Sargent Pillsbury, Minnesota's eighth governor, offered to build a branch library at the corner of University and Central Avenues in old St. Anthony (later East Minneapolis). The location was few blocks from the iconic Pillsbury \\"A\\" Mill and close to the governor's home. Although Pillsbury died before the library opened in April, 1904, the family carried out the gift. One of the most beautiful library branches in Minneapolis, the library was built out of marble and featured mahogany inside. In 1960 a new Central Library opened right across the river from the Pillsbury Library so a location closer to the University Community's core was sought. The Southeast Library replaced the Pillsbury Library in 1967. Located at 100 University Avenue Southeast, after many years as the Dolly Fiterman gallery, the Pillsbury Library more recently housed the Phillips Foundation. Seven Corners Library, 1906-1964 The Seven Corners Library was a branch of the Minneapolis Public Library from 1906-1964. A successful delivery station was replaced in 1906 by the Seven Corners Branch in a rented space at 231 Cedar Avenue. The Seven Corners (Cedar-Riverside) area was teeming with new immigrants and the library was quite busy. A permanent Seven Corners branch was built at 300 15th Ave. South in 1912. By 1964 the library's circulation numbers paled in comparison to its first decades of existence. The building was sold to the Minnesota Department of Transportation and was razed for highway construction. Southeast Library, 1967-2018 Southeast Library, built 1963, converted to a library in 1967. Currently part of the Hennepin County Library system. Southeast Library's building was designed by master architect Ralph Rapson and originally functioned as a credit union for university and state employees. It opened as a library in 1967.

It occupies an area of approximately 34,000 square meters adjacent to ELJ Communications Center. It was originally built in 1968 and was then the most advanced broadcast facility in Asia. Today it is now the country's largest and most technologically advanced media facility. Built as the headquarters of ABS-CBN, the center has since seen several management changes, such as a takeover by RPN and sister station BBC in 1973, the addition of a third tenant, the government station GTV (now PTV) in 1974, and then the departure of RPN and BBC in 1978 to Broadcast City (along with then-sister station IBC from San Juan del Monte) and the entry of NMPC and BB in 1980 which accompanied the remaining tenant MBS. From 1986 to 1992, the reopened ABS-CBN and PTV, along with PBS, shared the Broadcast Center and following PTV's departure in 1992, ABS-CBN has since regained full control of the facility. History 1968‚Äì1972: First era under ABS-CBN The broadcasting center, conceptualized by ABS-CBN's then-President Eugenio Lopez Jr., began construction on February 24, 1967 and was opened on December 18, 1968. Prior to the opening, ABS-CBN held headquarters in two buildings: the ABS building in Roxas Boulevard for ABS-CBN's Manila TV stations at that time, DZAQ-TV 3 and DZXL-TV 9, and the Chronicle Building in Aduana, Manila for its Manila radio stations. With the opening, ABS-CBN's radio and TV operations were housed in one building. ABS-CBN would soon sell the Roxas Boulevard studios to Kanlaon Broadcasting System or KBS (now known as Radio Philippines Network or RPN), which then took Channel 9 and prompted ABS-CBN to switch frequencies from Channels 3 and 9 to Channels 2 and 4. When it was opened, it was the most advanced TV broadcasting facility in Asia. ABS-CBN mentioned that before Martial Law, it was once the training ground of TV electronics engineers from other countries. The new TV transmitter tower known as the Millennium Transmitter in the complex would begin beaming Channel 2 and 4's signals in 1969. 1972‚Äì1986: Martial law and takeover by KBS/RPN, BBC, GTV/MBS and the BB The ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center as viewed from the rooftop of the main building of ABS-CBN. On September 22, 1972, ABS-CBN was shut down after then- President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law. All of its properties, which included the Broadcast Center, were seized from the network. The facility was not to be used again at least until RPN (then KBS until renamed it to the latter in 1975), whose first facility given by ABS-CBN was destroyed by a fire, took over the facility in 1973. It also became home of two newly formed networks BBC which took Channel 2 and Government Television (GTV) which took Channel 4 in 1974. The facility was also renamed as the Broadcast Plaza. RPN and BBC, were all owned by Roberto Benedicto (a prominent crony of Marcos ‚àí along with IBC, in which Benedicto bought the network (including its flagship channel 13) from the Canoys, who owns RMN and the Sorianos (as Inter-Island Broadcasting Corporation) in 1975; and IBC which is still based from then town of San Juan del Monte, Rizal province (now city of San Juan, Metro Manila) at that time), and GTV was owned by the government through National Media Production Center (NMPC). Benedicto owned the facility without any compensation. The crony-owned networks used ABS-CBN's facilities without even paying the network's owners, the Lopezes, making the network's technologies gradually dilapidated, resulting in it losing its prestige as one of the most advanced broadcasting centers in Asia. In July 1978, RPN and BBC left the Broadcast Plaza (along with IBC from San Juan del Monte) for their new home in the Broadcast City, situated in Old Balara in Quezon City, leaving GTV, which at that point was relaunched as Maharlika Broadcasting System (MBS) two years later, as the sole tenant of the facility. In 1980, the Bureau of Broadcasts (BB), a radio network also owned by the government under the Department/Ministry of Public Information, was also transferred to Broadcast Plaza after the Office of Media Affairs was created to provide a unitary form of media for both NMPC and the BB. In 1986, the complex was stormed by anti- Marcos rebel soldiers that attacked and took over Channel 4 under the supervision of ABS-CBN's former General Manager Augusto Almeda-Lopez. Channel 4 then went back on the air to serve the people and to broadcast the historic People Power Revolution that resulted in Ferdinand Marcos being ousted from office. 1986‚Äì1992: Housing ABS-CBN and PTV After Marcos was deposed and when Corazon Aquino became the first female president, MBS became People's Television Network (PTV) while the radio properties of NMPC and the BB were integrated to the reinstated pre-Martial Law era Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS, through the Bureau of Broadcast Services or BBS). The same year, RPN, IBC, and BBC were sequestered by the government from Benedicto. BBC was dissolved and its frequencies were given to ABS-CBN, which was turned back to the Lopezes and was relaunched on September 14, 1986. RPN and IBC, on the other hand ‚àí were turned over to the government (under the Presidential Communications Group). While Channel 4 remained with PTV, Channel 2 of the former BBC was given back to ABS-CBN. At that time, the facility was dilapidated. The technology in the facility was very old, the center was sorely lacking in tables, chairs, and telephones, there were plants growing on the compound's walls, and some of the studios' walls were even crumbling. In January 1987, the network did get back the facility, but with an agreement with PTV (which also had to deal with the facility's outdated equipment) wherein they will share the space, splitting it 50‚Äì50 (until January 22, 1992). In just two years after reopening, ABS-CBN would soon regain ratings leadership and propel itself back to financial stability. During the coup attempt against President Aquino on August 28, 1987, a fierce fire fight between rebel soldiers and the police raged around the compound as rebel soldiers seized PTV. Eventually, the rebels' assault was thwarted and PTV was back under the control of the government, but in the midst of the conflict, P/Sgt. Eduardo A. Esguerra of the Quezon City Police Department fell and died in the compound. A marker in his memory on the spot where he died was erected a year after the assault, and Bohol Avenue, where ABS-CBN is situated, was eventually renamed Sgt. Esguerra Avenue. The network soon filed a case against Marcos, Benedicto, and his networks for not compensating for the usage of the broadcast technology and equipment in the facility that clearly belonged to ABS-CBN. At this point, the facility's former tenant RPN and its then-sister station IBC, once the dominant channels, both slumped in the ratings as ABS- CBN furthered its supremacy during the tail-end of the decade. In 1988, a fire hit one of the studios in the compound, injuring a few people and slightly damaging the broadcast equipment. It was also the site of a failed military coup in 1989 that attempted to overthrow the then-current Aquino government. DZMM, ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station, soon moved to the Broadcast Center in 1987, along with DWRR, its flagship FM radio station. Prior to this, DZMM was once housed at the Chronicle Building (now Benpres Building) in Ortigas Center, Pasig City, where it was relaunched in 1986 as a news and commentary station. Millennium Transmitter at night. 1992‚Äì1999: Second era under ABS- CBN After years on January 22, 1992, ABS-CBN finally regained full control of the facility after both PTV and the PBS/BBS moved out of the area for a new broadcasting complex (Government Information and Media Center Building) and the new 500 ft (150 m) transmitter tower situated in Visayas Avenue, Quezon City. The network renovated the Broadcasting Center and began the long, tedious process of updating its broadcasting technology and equipment. By the end of the millennium, the Broadcast Center had become the most advanced broadcast facility in the Philippines. 2000‚Äìpresent: The new millennium The ABS-CBN Studios and open parking lot in 2012 In 2000, the Broadcasting Center was renovated again, with its hallways turned into a picture gallery of the network's stars and personalities, and the transmitter in the complex was relaunched as the Millennium Transmitter, increasing its transmitter power to 120 kilowatts. That same year, the network moved most of its operations to the newly inaugurated Eugenio Lopez Jr. Communications Center, named in honor of the network's late chairman Eugenio Lopez, Jr. It became the new home of the offices of many of the network's operations as well as four new technologically advanced studios (including Studio 10, the biggest studio in the complex, and the home of ASAP, ABS-CBN's longest-running Sunday noontime variety show). The building was accredited by PEZA as an IT zone in 2003. The building was built mainly to suit ABS-CBN's growing demands - a result of its diversification from a broadcasting network to a media powerhouse engaging not only in radio and TV broadcasting but now also in movie production, records, merchandising, cable and UHF TV, international services, and post-production. The Broadcast Center is still being used as the headquarters for the network's news division and its nine studios are still being used by the network's entertainment programs. In 2003 (ABS-CBN's 50th anniversary), the National Historical Commission set up a plaque in the entrance of the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center, honouring the first TV broadcast made in the country, made by DZAQ-TV Channel 3, owned by Alto Broadcasting System, precursor of ABS-CBN. In 2005, the Millennium Transmitter increased its power to 346.2 kilowatts (60 kW TPO), the most powerful in its history. In 2008, in honour of the 80th birthday of one of its most prized talents, the late comedy king Dolphy (who was with ABS- CBN for most of his showbiz career), Studio 1 was renamed as the Dolphy Theater. In 2009, the Millennium Transmitter increased its height to 720 feet and was also reinforced with powerful dipole antennas replacing the cylinder antennas. Throughout early and mid-2020, in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, the broadcasting center became the site of the commemoration following the expiration of the ABS-CBN's franchise, and the subsequent rallies and noise barrages generated by thousands of ABS-CBN employees and supporters, regarding the opposition of the verdict from the House of the Representatives. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center Quezon City in 2010 ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center Quezon City in 2015 Structures ABS-CBN main building The ABS-CBN main building was originally built in 1968 and was the main headquarters of the whole ABS-CBN network for decades until 2000 when the ELJ Communications Center was opened. It is directly connected to the network's studios which was also built in 1968. The main entrance to the whole complex is located here. Today, it is mainly occupied by the news division ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs and the Manila Radio Division which consist of DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 (AM) and MOR 101.9 (FM) as well as its ABS- CBNnews.com website. The ABS-CBN Newsroom which is used by the ABS-CBN News Channel for live broadcasts is located here. There is also a historical marker in the building's entrance which commemorates the first TV broadcast in the Philippines which was made by ABS-CBN on October 23, 1953, which was issued by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines in 2003, the 50th anniversary of ABS-CBN and Philippine television. ABS-CBN Studios ABS- CBN's studios are the oldest television studios of the network. It is actually a single large building that houses seven studios. It was originally built in 1968 and it is directly connected to the main building. Studio 1, now called the Dolphy Theatre, is named after the late comedian-actor Dolphy. Studio 2 was used by comedy talk show Gandang Gabi, Vice!. It is also used by the comedy show Banana Sundae. Studio 3 is the home studio of noontime variety show It's Showtime. Studio 4 houses the now game show I Can See Your Voice and The Bottomline with Boy Abunda. Studio 5 houses now-defunct Goin' Bulilit. Studio 6 houses the programs of the ABS-CBN News Channel, while ABS-CBN's flagship news programs TV Patrol, Bandila, News Patrol, Headline Pilipinas and Morning Edition of Market Edge airs live from Studio 7. ABS-CBN DTC Building The ABS-CBN Development and Talent Center building, which is also known as the DTC building, is a seven-story building that houses two studios, rehearsal rooms, a storage area, and the ABS-CBN's Star Magic Workshop's offices. Studios 11 and 12, which is located in the building's sixth floor, are used by ABS-CBN CPI's programs and O Shopping. The building was completed after 1998 and was the home of Star Magic before moving its offices to the ELJ building. ABS-CBN Sports occupied the entire 7th floor before its Technical group was disbanded and its Production team moved to a room inside DZMM.

She is one of the founders of the Marine Megafauna Foundation and was the subject of the Natural World documentary Andrea: Queen of Mantas. She now works at the Manta Ray & Whale Shark Research Center at Tofo Beach, Mozambique.Do Fish Sleep? In 2013, she was named a National Geographic \\"Emerging Explorer\\" for her research.  Early life and education  Andrea Marshall's interest for marine life started around age twelve when she first learned to dive. During that age, she gained a love for shark conservation. While in Mozambique on a family vacation, young Andrea stumbled upon a mass of manta rays. That is where her love for these sea animals began. In 2008, Andrea Marshall earned her PhD studying the manta ray species at the University of Queensland in Australia. She was the first student to get a degree for manta ray ecology.  Career  Dr. Marshall completed her thesis in 2008, and after receiving her PhD, she devoted the rest of her life to the giant ‚Äúsea birds.‚Äù She now lives in southern Mozambique as an activist for manta ray protection. There she helps organize scientific strategies to protect the sea animals that are living right in their backyards.Queen of Mantas Later in 2009, she had revealed a new species of manta ray. Currently, there is one species called the Manta Birostris that is considered to be the ‚ÄúGiant Manta‚Äù (Warner). These rays, that can grow up to 23 feet long, still possess a smaller portion of their once large stinger on the end of their tails. These stingers cause no harm to humans and are now worthless. The second species that was discovered by Dr. Marshall is called the Manta Alfredi. This second species stays closer to the reefs and is much smaller in size. This new species is one of the largest fish discoveries that scientists have seen in over 45 years. Andrea has also found a third species but has spent the last ten years organizing and continuing to find more information about the horned ‚Äúdevil-looking‚Äù fish. Nothing has been published yet about this third species. Giant Ocean Manta Ray To find all this new information, she has used expensive diving technology and photography devices. She developed Manta Matcher, an online citizen science database for identifying individual manta rays from their unique markings. As a global advocate for her underwater companions, Andrea has investigated all her energy in studying their ecology, habitat domains, and social orientation. She has also studied the animals‚Äô migration patterns finding out that in just 60 days, they migrate more than 650 miles. The journey that Dr. Marshall takes with the manta rays has been recognized as the longest fish migration in the Indian Ocean. Andrea has studied manta rays all over the globe. Her work has been credited in several magazines and online articles. In 2013, her BBC documentary was made available to the public eye. In this documentary she talks about why she is so attached to these mysterious fish and how she advocates for the terrible threats they face. Some threats include habitat destruction, over-fishing, and reckless boat incidents.  Family  Andrea is married and has a young daughter. All three spend months traveling from one manta ray coast to another. Dr. Marshall must stay close to the local neighborhoods as well as the manta rays to be able to do her job well. Andrea and her family are currently living in Vilanculos, Mozambique.  Foundations & honors  Andrea is the CEO and one of the main founders of the Marine Megafauna Foundation (MMF). This foundation strives to protect all ocean giants from the dangers that they are facing. National Geographic also endowed the 2013 Emerging Explorer honor to Andrea. This award was given to 17 individuals who National Geographic believes are notable explorers.

Large sack coaling in the Royal Navy The large sack was a UK unit of weight for coal. It was introduced by the London, Westminster and Home Counties Coal Trade Act of 1831 (2 Will 4 c lxxvi), which required coal to be sold by weight rather than volume. The Royal Navy used large sacks holding two hundredweight for coaling its ships. These sacks were made of jute bound with Manila rope. They were filled in the hold of a collier using a scoop and then a wire cable was run through two iron rings at the mouth of the sack to close and hoist it over to the warship, twelve sacks at a time. A sack truck would then be used to take each sack to the chute of the warship's coal bunker where they would be emptied.

He amassed what is recognised as one of the most significant collections of its type in the world. The Hawley Collection is now housed at Kelham Island Museum in Sheffield, England.  Life and career  Kenneth Wybert Hawley was born on the Manor estate in Sheffield on 29 June 1927 to Walter and Isabella Hawley. His father was a wire-worker who set up his own business, Wire Products, making wire guards for machinery in Sheffield's manufacturing industries. The family moved to the Wadsley area of the city in 1932, and to a newly built semi-detached house in the same area in 1939 where Hawley lived for the remainder of his life. Hawley attended Marlcliffe County Infant and Junior School, Wisewood Secondary School and in 1940 gained entrance to Sheffield Junior Technical School. He left school a year later at the age of fourteen to assist in his father's business, which needed people to replace those workers who had been called up to the armed forces during World War 2. Through his father's business, Hawley was exposed to many industrial workshops in the city as he took measurements and designed solutions for customers. The experience gave him an enduring respect for those who worked in the Sheffield cutlery and tool-manufacturing industries, which were then still famous throughout the world; it also instilled in him an abiding curiosity for how they had achieved their status and produced their wares. Hawley then spent some time in the British Army under the compulsory National Service scheme. Upon being released in 1947, he became a tool salesman, working firstly for Sheffield hardware firm Wilkes Bros., then for Joseph Gleave of Manchester, and then becoming shop manager for tool merchants J. Rhodes & Sons in Rotherham. He married Emily in 1953; the couple had two sons. In 1959, Hawley established his own specialist tool shop in Sheffield, advertising it with the slogan \\"We sell nowt but tools\\" to distinguish it from ironmongers and general hardware stores. Hawley ceased his involvement in his tool shop in 1989. He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by Sheffield Hallam University in 1995 and was appointed a MBE in 1998. The latter honour was bestowed for his forty-year involvement as, according to several obituaries, the \\"driving force\\" behind restoration of Wortley Top Forge, a 17th-century finery forge and ironworks that has been restored by volunteers who were inspired by him. He was also a founder member and President of the Tools and Trades History Society. Ken Hawley died on 15 August 2014; he was survived by his wife and sons.  Collecting  Hawley said that he had no interest in history until 1950, when he visited a customer to demonstrate a machine. While at the customer's premises, he noticed a joiner's brace of a design that he had not seen before and was able to acquire it. Perhaps the most significant single development to his collection came in 1965 when he paid a business visit to the William Marples company and discovered that the firm's plane-manufacturing workshop was being closed. The Marples company was the last maker of a specific type of wooden plane and Hawley asked whether he could have some examples. According to Simon Barley, writing an obituary in The Guardian: But more than just collect the artefacts, what Hawley realised was that knowledge of the skills of wooden moulding plane-making would be lost with retirement of Albert Boch, the last plane maker at Marples. So, he recruited two cine-camera enthusiasts to help him film Albert Boch making a plane from start to finish; and he went on to make other short films showing surviving makers in a range of tool manufacturing trades in their working environment before they became extinct. He also considered trade catalogues and other ancillary items an important record and illustration of the range of products, many of which have no surviving examples, and these were added to his acquisitions . As time passed, Hawley became known for uttering the phrase, \\"You'll not be wanting this, will you?\\" The Sheffield tool-making industry went into decline due to changes both in the economy and in technology and he acquired a reputation as the person to approach when a business was closing. His knowledge, which was bolstered by an interest in researching the disappearing skills, enabled him to select those items that were worthy of adding to his collection. The extent of the Hawley Collection was matched by the extent of his knowledge regarding it. It comprises over 70,000 tools, mostly but not entirely from Sheffield, as well as catalogues and other documents. The tools include many examples of such things as planes, table knives, anvils, files, taps and dies, rules, micrometres, scissors, hammers, handsaws, and vernier and caliper gauges. He stored these in two garden sheds, then in his garage. The garage was eventually turned into a two-storey building to provide more space, and he also used his attic as well as space begged from other people. Hawley spread his knowledge among a team of volunteers who both assisted in cataloguing the collection and in some cases became experts in their own right. He also co- authored books on various aspects of the Sheffield steel industries and took part in many interviews that have since been transcribed. The Hawley Collection first came into public prominence following a meeting in 1991 with Janet Barnes, who was then Director of the Ruskin Gallery in Sheffield. An exhibition titled The Cutting Edge was arranged that drew upon the material and this led to the formation of the Ken Hawley Collection Trust, whose objective was to acquire and conserve it. Funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and support from the University of Sheffield led to the collection being transferred to premises at the university around 1998‚Äì99. It was officially recognised as a museum in 2002. A further, much larger HLF grant in 2008 allowed more spacious and specialist premises to be formed by converting buildings at Kelham Island Museum in the city. Those premises opened in 2010 and were extended in 2012; a third phase of development has been proposed. The collection is, according to Barley, \\"widely recognised as one of the best places to learn about tools and tool-making anywhere in the world\\". In September 2020 the Hawley Collection announced a project to trace the descendants Sheffield's famous knife makers.

In 2014, Streetlife partnered with international media licensing company Amurco to launch 'StreetSound'. The project consisted of 8 weekly songwriting workshops to create a song with the young homeless people from Streetlife. The song was released as part of a campaign to boost external funding for the charity and receives donations though the JustGiving page.

The books cover what was known of the \\"natural sciences\\" at the time, including what would now be called material science, physics, chemistry and technology as well as the natural history of animals.  Histoire Naturelle, an encyclopaedic work  The Comte de Buffon (1707‚Äì1788) made the Histoire Naturelle his life's work. The Histoire Naturelle, g√©n√©rale et particuli√®re, avec la description du Cabinet du Roi is the work that the Comte de Buffon (1707‚Äì1788) is remembered for. He worked on it for some 50 years, initially at Montbard in his office in the Tour Saint- Louis, then in his library at Petit Fontenet. 36 volumes came out between 1749 and 1789, followed by 8 more after his death, thanks to Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de. It includes all the knowledge available in his time on the \\"natural sciences\\", a broad term that includes disciplines which today would be called material science, physics, chemistry and technology. Buffon notes the morphological similarities between men and apes, although he considered apes completely devoid of the ability to think, differentiating them sharply from human beings.Buffon, \\"Nomenclature des Singes \\", in Histoire Naturelle, g√©n√©rale et particuli√®re, avec la description du Cabinet du Roi, Tome Quatorzi√®me (\\"Histoire Naturelle des Quadrup√®des\\" XI), Imprimerie royale, Paris, 1766. Buffon's attention to internal anatomy made him an early comparative anatomist. \\"L‚Äôint√©rieur, dans les √™tres vivants, est le fond du dessin de la nature\\", he wrote in his Quadrup√®des, \\"the interior, in living things, is the foundation of nature's design.\\"Buffon, \\"L'Unau et l'A√Ø\\", in Histoire Naturelle, g√©n√©rale et particuli√®re, avec la description du Cabinet du Roi, Tome Treizi√®me (\\"Histoire Naturelle des Quadrup√®des\\" X), Imprimerie royale, Paris, 1765. The Histoire Naturelle, which was meant to address the whole of natural history, actually covers only minerals, birds, and the quadrupeds among animals. It is accompanied by some discourses and a theory of the earth by way of introduction, and by supplements including an elegantly written account of the epochs of nature. The Suppl√©ments cover a wide range of topics; for example, in (Suppl√©ments IV), there is a Discours sur le style (Discourse on Style) and an Essai d'arithm√©tique morale (essay on Moral Arithmetic). Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton assisted Buffon on the quadrupeds; Philippe Gu√©neau de Montbeillard worked on the birds. They were joined, from 1767, by Barth√©lemy Faujas de Saint-Fond, the abbot Gabriel Bexon and Charles- Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt. The whole descriptive and anatomical part of l‚ÄôHistoire des Quadrup√®des was the work of Daubenton and Jean-Claude Mertrud. Lynx in Volume IX, by Jacques de S√®ve Buffon attached much importance to the illustrations; Jacques de S√®ve illustrated the quadrupeds and Fran√ßois- Nicolas Martinet illustrated the birds. Nearly 2000 plates adorn the work, representing animals with care given both to aesthetics and anatomical accuracy, with dreamlike and mythological settings. On minerals, Buffon collaborated with Andr√© Thouin. Barth√©lemy Faujas de Saint-Fond and Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau provided sources for the mineral volumes. L‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle met immense success, almost as great as Encyclop√©die by Diderot, which came out in the same period. The first three volumes of L‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle, g√©n√©rale et particuli√®re, avec la description du cabinet du Roi were reprinted three times in six weeks.Roger, Jacques. Buffon, un philosophe au Jardin du Roi, Fayard, Paris, 1989, 645 p. The encyclopaedia appeared in 36 volumes : * 3 volumes in 1749 : De la mani√®re d‚Äô√©tudier l‚Äôhistoire naturelle followed by Th√©orie de la Terre, Histoire G√©n√©rale des animaux and Histoire Naturelle de l‚Äôhomme * 12 volumes on quadrupeds (1753 to 1767) * 9 volumes on birds (1770 to 1783]) * 5 volumes on minerals (1783 to 1788), the last including Trait√© de l‚Äôaimant, the last work published by Buffon in his lifetime * 7 volumes of supplements (1774 to 1789), including √âpoques de la nature (from 1778). L‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle was initially printed at the Imprimerie royale in 36 volumes (1749‚Äì1789). In 1764 Buffon bought back the rights to his work. It was continued by Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de, who described the egg-laying quadrupeds, snakes, fishes and cetaceans in 8 volumes (1788‚Äì1804). Buffon was assisted in the work by Jacques-Fran√ßois Artur (1708‚Äì1779), Gabriel L√©opold Charles Am√© Bexon (1748‚Äì1785), Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton (1716‚Äì1799), Edme-Louis Daubenton (1732‚Äì1786), Jacques de S√®ve (actif 1742‚Äì1788), Barth√©lemy Faujas de Saint-Fond (1741‚Äì1819), Philippe Gu√©neau de Montbeillard (1720‚Äì1785), Louis-Bernard Guyton-Morveau (1737‚Äì1816), Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de (1756‚Äì1825), Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet (1731‚Äì1800), the anatomist (1728‚Äì1802), Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt (1751‚Äì1812), and Andr√© Thouin (1747‚Äì1823).  Approach  Spread of quarto pages, with decorative tail-piece illustration (1779) Each group is introduced with a general essay. This is followed by an article, sometimes of many pages, on each animal (or other item). The article on the wolf begins with the claim that it is one of the animals with a specially strong appetite for flesh; it asserts that the animal is naturally coarse and cowardly (grossier et poltron), but becoming crafty at need, and hardy by necessity, driven by hunger.Le Loup Volume VII. p. 39 The language, as in this instance, is elegant and elaborate, even \\"flowery and ornate\\". Buffon was roundly criticised by his fellow academics for writing a \\"purely popularizing work, empty and puffed up, with little real scientific value\\". The species is named in Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, German, English, Swedish, and Polish. The zoological descriptions of the species by Gessner, Ray, Linnaeus, Klein and Buffon himself (\\"Canis ex griseo flavescens. Lupus vulgaris. Buffon. Reg. animal. pag. 235\\") are cited. The text is written as a continuous essay, without the sections on identification, distribution and behaviour that might have been expected from other natural histories. Parts concern human responses rather than the animal itself, as for example that the wolf likes human flesh, and the strongest wolves sometimes eat nothing else.Le Loup Volume VII. p. 48 Measurements may be included; in the case of the wolf, 41 separate measurements are tabulated, in pre-revolutionary French feet and inches starting with the \\"Length of the whole body measured in a straight line from the end of the muzzle to the anus........3 feet. 7 inches.\\" (1.2 m); the \\"Length of the largest claws\\" is given as \\"10 lines\\" (2.2 cm).Le Loup Volume VII. pp. 57‚Äì58 The wolf is illustrated standing in farmland, and as a complete skeleton standing on a stone plinth in a landscape. The account of the species occupies 32 pages including illustrations.  Editions   Buffon's original edition continued by Lac√©p√®de  Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de (1756‚Äì1825) continued the Histoire Naturelle after Buffon's death. The original edition of the Histoire Naturelle by Buffon comprised 36 volumes in quarto, divided into the following series: Histoire de la Terre et de l'Homme, Quadrup√®des, Oiseaux, Min√©raux, Suppl√©ments. Buffon edited 35 volumes in his lifetime. Soon after his death, the fifth and final volume of l‚ÄôHistoire des min√©raux appeared in 1788 at the Imprimerie des B√¢timents du Roi. The seventh and final volume of Suppl√©ments by Buffon was published posthumously in 1789 through Lac√©p√®de's hands. Lac√©p√®de continued the part of the Histoire Naturelle which dealt with animals. A few months before Buffon's death, en 1788, Lac√©p√®de published, as a continuation, the first volume of his Histoire des Reptiles, on egg-laying quadrupeds. The next year, he wrote a second volume on snakes, published during the French Revolution. Between 1798 and 1803, he brought out the volume Histoire des Poissons. Lac√©p√®de made use of the notes and collections left by Philibert Commerson (1727‚Äì1773). He wrote Histoire des C√©tac√©s which was printed in 1804. At that point, the Histoire Naturelle, by Buffon and Lac√©p√®de, thus contained 44 quarto volumes forming the definitive edition.Hendrik Cornelius Dirk De Wit, Histoire du D√©veloppement de la Biologie, Volume III, Presses Polytechniques et Universitaires Romandes, Lausanne, 1994, pp. 101‚Äì110.  Variations in the editions by Buffon and Lac√©p√®de  Another edition in quarto format was printed by the Imprimerie royale in 36 volumes (1774‚Äì1804). It consisted of 28 volumes by Buffon, and 8 volumes by Lac√©p√®de. The part containing anatomical articles by Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton was dropped. The supplements were merged into the relevant articles in the main volumes. The Imprimerie royale also published two editions of the Histoire Naturelle in duodecimo format (1752‚Äì1805), occupying 90 or 71 volumes, depending on whether or not they included the part on anatomy. In this print format, the original work by Buffon occupied 73 volumes with the part on anatomy, or 54 volumes without the part on anatomy. The continuation by Lac√©p√®de took up 17 duodecimo volumes. A de luxe edition of Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux (Birds) (1771‚Äì1786) was produced by the Imprimerie royale in 10 folio and quarto volumes, with 1008 engraved and hand-coloured plates, executed under Buffon's personal supervision by Edme-Louis Daubenton, cousin and brother-in-law of Buffon's principal collaborator.Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu, Sixi√®me Notice historique sur le Mus√©um, Annales du Mus√©um d'Histoire Naturelle, Tome Onzi√®me, Tourneisen Fils libraire, Paris, 1808, p.1-39.  Translations  The Histoire Naturelle was translated into languages including English, German, Swedish, Russian and Italian. Many translations, often partial (single volumes, or all volumes to a certain date), abridged, reprinted in the same translation by different printers, or with additional text (for example on insects) and new illustrations, were made at the end of the eighteenth century and the start of the nineteenth century, presenting a complicated publication history. Early translations were necessarily only of the earlier volumes. Given the complexity, all catalogue dates other than of single volumes should be taken as approximate. R. Griffith published an early translation of the volume on The Horse in London in 1762. T. Bell published a translation of the first six volumes in London between 1775 and 1776. William Creech published an edition in Edinburgh between 1780 and 1785. T. Cadell and W. Davies published another edition in London in 1812. An abridged edition was published by Wogan, Byrne et al. in Dublin in 1791; that same year R. Morison and Son of Perth, J. and J. Fairbairn of Edinburgh and T. Kay and C. Forster of London published their edition. W. Strahan and T. Cadell published a translation with notes by the encyclopaedist William Smellie in London around 1785. Barr's Buffon in ten volumes was published in London between 1797 and 1807. W. Davidson published an abridged version including the natural history of insects taken from Swammerdam, Brookes, Goldsmith et al., with \\"elegant engravings on wood\\"; its four volumes appeared in Alnwick in 1814. German translations include those published by Joseph Georg Trassler 1784‚Äì1785; by Pauli, 1772‚Äì1829; Grund and Holle, 1750‚Äì1775; and Johann Samuel Heinsius, 1756‚Äì1782. Italian translations include those published by Fratelle Bassaglia around 1788 and Boringherieri in 1959. Per Olof Gravander translated an 1802‚Äì1803 French abridgement into Swedish, publishing it in √ñrebro in 1806‚Äì1807. A Russian version (The General and Particular Natural History by Count Buffon; \\"–í—Å–µ–æ–±—â–∞—è –∏ —á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∞—è –µ—Å—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∞ –ë—é—Ñ—Ñ–æ–Ω–∞\\") was brought out by The Imperial Academy of Sciences (–ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏–µ–π –ù–∞—É–∫) in St. Petersburg between 1789 and 1808.

Wealthy homes in both England and France purchased copies, and the first edition was sold out within six weeks. But Buffon was criticised by some priests for suggesting (in the essay Les Epoques de Nature, Volume XXXIV) that the earth was more than 6,000 years old and that mountains had arisen in geological time. Buffon cites as evidence that fossil sea-shells had been found at the tops of mountains; but the claim was seen as contradicting the biblical account in the Book of Genesis. Buffon also disagreed with Linnaeus's system of classifying plants as described in Systema Naturae (1735). In Buffon's view, expounded in the \\"Premier Discours\\" of the Histoire Naturelle (1749), the concept of species was entirely artificial, the only real entity in nature being the individual; as for a taxonomy based on the number of stamens or pistils in a flower, mere counting (despite Buffon's own training in mathematics) had no bearing on nature. The Paris faculty of theology, acting as the official censor, wrote to Buffon with a list of statements in the Histoire Naturelle that were contradictory to Roman Catholic Church teaching. Hypocritically, Buffon replied that he believed firmly in the biblical account of creation, and was able to continue printing his book, and remain in position as the leader of the 'old school', complete with his job as director of the royal botanical garden. On Buffon's death, the 19-year-old Georges Cuvier celebrated with the words \\"This time, the Comte de Buffon is dead and buried\\". Soon afterwards, the French revolution went much further in sweeping away old attitudes to natural history, along with much else.  Modern  Newborn hippopotamus (1767)  Philosophy  The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy calls the Histoire Naturelle \\"Buffon's major work\\", observing that \\"In addressing the history of the earth, Buffon also broke with the 'counter- factual' tradition of Descartes, and presented a secular and realist account of the origins of the earth and its life forms.\\" In its view, the work created an \\"age of Buffon\\", defining what natural history itself was, while Buffon's \\"Discourse on Method\\" (unlike that of Descartes) at the start of the work argued that repeated observation could lead to a greater certainty of knowledge even than \\"mathematical analysis of nature\\". Buffon also led natural history away from the natural theology of British parson-naturalists such as John Ray. He thus offered both a new methodology and an empirical style of enquiry. Buffon's position on evolution is complex; he noted in Volume 4 from Daubenton's comparative anatomy of the horse and the donkey that species might \\"transform\\", but initially (1753) rejected the possibility. However, in doing so he changed the definition of a species from a fixed or universal class (which could not change, by definition) to \\"the historical succession of ancestor and descendant linked by material connection through generation\\", identified by the ability to mate and produce fertile offspring. Thus the horse and donkey, which produce only sterile hybrids, are seen empirically not to be the same species, even though they have similar anatomy. That empirical fact leaves open the possibility of evolution.  Style  The botanist Sandra Knapp writes that \\"Buffon's prose was so purple that the ideas themselves are almost hidden\\", observing that this was also the contemporary academic opinion. She notes that some quite radical ideas are to be found in his work, but they are almost invisible, given the language they are cloaked in. She quotes Buffon's dramatic description of the lion, which along with the engraving in her view \\"emphasized both the lion's regal bearing and personality not only in his text but also in the illustration... A reader was left in no doubt as to the importance and character of the animal.\\" She concludes \\"No wonder the cultured aristocratic public lapped it up ‚Äì the text reads more like a romantic novel than a dry scientific treatise\\".  Evolutionary thought  The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr comments that \\"In this monumental and fascinating Histoire naturelle, Buffon dealt in a stimulating manner with almost all the problems that would subsequently be raised by evolutionists. Written in a brilliant style, this work was read in French or in one of the numerous translations by every educated person in Europe\\". Mayr argued that \\"virtually all the well-known writers of the Enlightenment\\" were \\"Buffonians\\", and calls Buffon \\"the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the eighteenth century\\". Mayr notes that Buffon was not an \\"evolutionist\\", but was certainly responsible for creating the great amount of interest in natural history in France. He agrees that Buffon's thought is hard to classify and even self-contradictory, and that the theologians forced him to avoid writing some of his opinions openly. Mayr argues however that Buffon was \\"fully aware of the possibility of 'common descent', and was perhaps the first author ever to articulate it clearly\\", quoting Buffon at length, starting with \\"Not only the ass and the horse, but also man, the apes, the quadrupeds, and all the animals might be regarded as constituting but a single family\\", and later \\"that man and ape have a common origin\\", and that \\"the power of nature...with sufficient time, she has been able from a single being to derive all the other organized beings\\". Mayr notes, however, that Buffon immediately rejects the suggestion and offers three arguments against it, namely that no new species have arisen in historical times; that hybrid infertility firmly separates species; and that animals intermediate between, say, the horse and the donkey are not seen (in the fossil record).

Life and work After graduation from Wellesley College in 1916, Weeks went on to work as a teacher and a statistical clerk before becoming the third woman to work as a patent examiner at the US Patent Office in 1917. In 1924 she obtained a second master's degree, from the Prince School of Business at Simmons College, and became an employment supervisor for Jordan Marsh, the Boston department store. But by 1928, she had returned to academia, teaching physics at Wellesley College while working on her doctorate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1930, Weeks completed a PhD in theoretical physics from the mathematics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her dissertation work was guided by Norbert Wiener. Following completion of graduate studies, Weeks developed and led the physics department at Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania from 1930-1956. Weeks left Wilson on sabbatical from 1943 to 1945, when she worked as a technical aide at the Office of Scientific Research and Development. Later, between 1949‚Äì50, Weeks was a Guggenheim fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1956-1964, Weeks was a physicist at the Watertown Arsenal and the technical representative for the Committee on Radioactive Shielding. In 1964, she worked for the NASA supported Solar Satellite Project at the Harvard College Observatory. She would continue to work as at Harvard as a spectroscopist, studying solar satellites at the Harvard College Observatory until she retired in 1976 at the age of eighty- three.

After a year staff employed by the organisation become shareholders, which allows them to make representations at the annual general meeting and be involved in the selection of directors and non-executive directors. Paymaster General Francis Maude mentioned the organisation at a speech in December 2014 about the Better Care Fund saying the company could provide care without the NHS's \\"endless process, bureaucracy and auditing\\". Maude related how the company had helped a homeless man who was too poor to pay for his dog to be looked after while he received hospital treatment for leg ulcers. Inclusion Healthcare wrote \\"a cheque for ¬£200 or whatever it cost to have the dog vaccinated and put into kennels\\". According to Maude this payment meant that a very expensive operation to amputate the man's leg was avoided, and there was a further saving on the \\"massive disability payments\\" that would have been made over the man's lifetime.

Similar to the Red Mass, the service honors those who have died in the line of duty and those currently serving as first responders. The Mass is an opportunity for the community to show gratitude to first responders and their families. Background In Washington, D.C. the service is held in conjunction with National Police Week. Psalm 91:11, \\"For He will give His angels [especial] charge over you to accompany and defend and preserve you in all your ways [of obedience and service],\\" are often invoked during the service. Though usually held in a Catholic church, the events are generally considered to be ecumenical or non-denominational. The Blue Mass dates to September 29, 1934, when Rev.

The first mass was held at St. Patrick‚Äôs Catholic Church in Washington, D.C. and has grown to a nationwide celebration.

There are 5 largest mountains in Kerala except the Western Ghats. Three of them are in Malappuram district, one in Palakkad and one in Kannur.It is the second highest mountain in Malappuram district in terms of height. The British hoisted their flag on this hilltop during a survey, thus getting the name Kodikuthimala. It is almost two decades ago that the hilltop started featuring on the tourism map of Kerala. Around 70 acres of land in this area is earmarked by the Tourism Department for various projects. Kodikuthimala, at an altitude of 1,713-ft above sea level, has a watch tower that is visited by tourists because of the vantage point it offers.

Alois Strohmayer was born in Vienna in 1822 and began writing music at the age of just seventeen. Starting off writing only violin pieces, he soon turned to folk music ensembles with well-known musicians such as Georg Danzer and the Schrammel brothers in the form of Schrammelmusik. His compositions included waltzes, polkas, dances and marches with influence being drawn from Johann Strauss Sr., Josef Lanner and Schubert. He wrote primarily for an ensemble of two violins, bass guitar and woodwind instrument, flute or clarinet. He died at the age of 78 in 1890.

Kirkwood and Frank P. Buff, links macroscopic (bulk) properties to microscopic (molecular) details. Using statistical mechanics, the KB theory derives thermodynamic quantities from pair correlation functions between all molecules in a multi-component solution. The KB theory proves to be a valuable tool for validation of molecular simulations, as well as for the molecular-resolution elucidation of the mechanisms underlying various physical processes. For example, it has numerous applications in biologically relevant systems. The reverse process is also possible; the so-called reverse Kirkwood‚ÄìBuff (reverse-KB) theory, due to Arieh Ben-Naim, derives molecular details from thermodynamic (bulk) measurements. This advancement allows the use of the KB formalism to formulate predictions regarding microscopic properties on the basis of macroscopic information.  The radial distribution function  The radial distribution function (RDF), also termed the pair distribution function or the pair correlation function, is a measure of local structuring in a mixture. The RDF between components i and j positioned at \\\\boldsymbol{r}_i and \\\\boldsymbol{r}_j, respectively, is defined as: : g_{ij}(\\\\boldsymbol{R})=\\\\frac{\\\\rho_{ij}(\\\\boldsymbol{R})}{\\\\rho_{ij}^\\\\text{bulk}} where \\\\rho_{ij} (\\\\boldsymbol{R}) is the local density of component j relative to component i, the quantity \\\\rho_{ij}^\\\\text{bulk} is the density of component j in the bulk, and \\\\boldsymbol{R}= |\\\\boldsymbol{r}_i-\\\\boldsymbol{r}_jis the inter-particle radius vector. Necessarily, it also follows that: : g_{ij} (\\\\boldsymbol{R}) = g_{ji}(\\\\boldsymbol{R}) Assuming spherical symmetry, the RDF reduces to: : g_{ij}(r)=\\\\frac{\\\\rho_{ij}(r)}{\\\\rho_{ij}^\\\\text{bulk}} where r=|\\\\boldsymbol{R}is the inter-particle distance. In certain cases, it is useful to quantify the intermolecular correlations in terms of free energy. Specifically, the RDF is related to the potential of mean force (PMF) between the two components by: : PMF_{ij}(r)=-kT\\\\ln(g_{ij}) where the PMF is essentially a measure of the effective interactions between the two components in the solution.  The Kirkwood‚ÄìBuff integrals  The Kirkwood‚ÄìBuff integral (KBI) between components i and j is defined as the spatial integral over the pair correlation function: : G_{ij}=\\\\int\\\\limits_V [g_{ij}(\\\\boldsymbol{R})-1]\\\\,d\\\\boldsymbol{R} which in the case of spherical symmetry reduces to: G_{ij}=4\\\\pi\\\\int_{r=0}^\\\\infty [g_{ij} (r)-1]r^2 \\\\, dr KBI, having units of volume per molecule, quantifies the excess (or deficiency) of particle j around particle i.  Derivation of thermodynamic quantities   Two-component system  It is possible to derive various thermodynamic relations for a two-component mixture in terms of the relevant KBI (G_{11}, G_{22}, and G_{12}). The partial molar volume of component 1 is: : \\\\bar V_1=\\\\frac{1+c_2 (G_{22}-G_{12})}{c_1+c_2+c_1c_2 (G_{11}+G_{22}-2G_{12})} where c is the molar concentration and naturally c_1\\\\bar V_1+c_2\\\\bar V_2=1 The compressibility, \\\\kappa, satisfies: : \\\\kappa kT=\\\\frac{1+c_1 G_{11}+c_2 G_{22}+c_1 c_2 (G_{11}G_{22}-G_{12}^2)}{c_1+c_2+c_1 c_2 (G_{11}+G_{22}-2 G_{12})} where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. The derivative of the osmotic pressure, \\\\Pi, with respect to the concentration of component 2: : \\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\Pi}{\\\\partial c_2}\\\\right)_{T,\\\\mu_1}=\\\\frac{kT}{1+c_2 G_{22}} where \\\\mu_1 is the chemical potential of component 1. The derivatives of chemical potentials with respect to concentrations, at constant temperature (T) and pressure (P) are: : \\\\frac{1}{kT} \\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\mu_1}{\\\\partial c_1}\\\\right)_{T,P}=\\\\frac{1}{c_1}+\\\\frac{G_{12}-G_{11}}{1+c_1 (G_{11}-G_{12})} : \\\\frac{1}{kT} \\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\mu_2}{\\\\partial c_2}\\\\right)_{T,P}=\\\\frac{1}{c_2}+\\\\frac{G_{12}-G_{22}}{1+c_2 (G_{22}-G_{12})} or alternatively, with respect to mole fraction: : \\\\frac{1}{kT} \\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\mu_2}{\\\\partial \\\\chi_2}\\\\right)_{T,P}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\chi_2}+\\\\frac{c_1 (2G_{12}-G_{11}-G_{22})}{1+c_1\\\\chi_2 (G_{11}+G_{22}-2G_{12})}  The preferential interaction coefficient  The relative preference of a molecular species to solvate (interact) with another molecular species is quantified using the preferential interaction coefficient, \\\\Gamma. Lets consider a solution that consists of the solvent (water), solute, and cosolute. The relative (effective) interaction of water with the solute is related to the preferential hydration coefficient, \\\\Gamma_W, which is positive if the solute is \\"preferentially hydrated\\". In the Kirkwood-Buff theory frame- work, and in the low concentration regime of cosolutes, the preferential hydration coefficient is: : \\\\Gamma_W=M_W\\\\left(G_{WS}-G_{CS}\\\\right) where M_W is the molarity of water, and W, S, and C correspond to water, solute, and cosolute, respectively. In the most general case, the preferential hydration is a function of the KBI of solute with both solvent and cosolute. However, under very simple assumptions and in many practical examples, it reduces to: : \\\\Gamma_W=-M_{W}G_{CS} So the only function of relevance is G_{CS}.

CGCs are alkaline-insoluble. Different species of fungi have different structural compositions of chitin and √ü-glucan making up the CGCs in their cell walls. Soil composition and other environmental factors can also affect the ratio of chitin to √ü-glucan found in the CGC. Fungal cell walls may also contain chitosan-glucan complexes, which are similar copolymers but have chitosan instead of chitin. Chitin and chitosan are closely related molecules: greater than 40% of the polymer chain of chitin is made of acetylated glucosamine units, whereas greater than 60% of chitosan is made of deacetylated glucosamine units. In their natural form, CGCs provide structural support to the fungal cell wall. Biomedical applications of CGCs have been studied, including the immunostimulant properties of A. fumigatus, as well as successful antibacterial activity against S. typhimurium by CGCs from A. niger and M. rouxii. There is some evidence that CGCs can act as an effective prebiotic, as it was tested on growing 100 different bifdobacterial strains as well as on rats in vivo. CGCs have many industrial applications, such as in food, cosmetics, and textiles industries, because they can be prepared easily without toxins. As food additives, they are commonly used due to their ability to adsorb heavy metal ions. Additionally, CGCs are produced in high volume industrially because they can be broken down into their constitutive components by hydrolysis, producing pure chitin (or chitosan) and √ü-glucans. Rather than being produced from animal parts, pure chitin can be extracted from the cell walls of the fungus Pichia pastoris, recently classified as Komagataella pastoris. Unlike chitin extracted from crustaceans, for example, this chitin contains no heavy metals. A study revealed that the complex exhibits traces of Œ±-chitin in the molecular structure via x-ray diffraction. The similarities in structure and physical properties suggest that the complex is a suitable alternative to crustacean-based chitin as fungi are a more feasible and reliable source of raw materials. The 1,3/1,6-√ü-D-glucan in this complex are macromolecules consisting solely of the carbohydrate glucose. There are many varieties of glucan. The main difference lies in the effectiveness and efficiency of these glucans. According to the most recent experimental studies, it is one of the most effective activators. 1,3/1,6-√ü-D- glucan complex boosts the immune system of humans and other animals.

Founded in 1858, Urner Barry focuses today on market information related to red meat, poultry, egg and seafood through its reports and websites. It also administers the sale of ancillary products and services. History In 1857, Benjamin Urner was working as a printer in New York City. As a printer, he would encounter many merchants coming to port and requesting price circulars for use at the markets. He began to notice discrepancies in the prices and decided to publish a universal report called the Producers' Price Current, which was later renamed the Urner Barry Price- Current. The report eventually became a daily circular and the data were collected by visiting with buyers and sellers in New York marketplaces. Urner and his son founded the Urner Publishing Company in 1882, which offered one year subscriptions for $1.00. In 1873, L. Frank Barry started the New York Daily Market Report, which covered all produce markets. It was the first such daily publication in the country. Since the two were engaged in a similar type of business, they recognized an area of mutual interest and together formed the Urner-Barry Company, which was originally located on 173-175 Chamber Street in New York City. Ulner and Barry were lauded for their expertise in the industry, and even consulted during the publication of L.D.H. Weld's The Marketing of Farm ProductsWeld, L.D.H. \\"The Marketing of Farm Products\\" 1916. Print. In the 1960s, the company moved to Jersey City, New Jersey and later to the Toms River area. COMTELL COMTELL (short for \\"Commodity Intelligence\\") began as a computer platform that transmitted price quotes daily via satellite. It was the company's answer to the growth and progression of their report publishing business, which prior to this had been done by mail. In the mid-1990s, COMTELL went live as a website. It is used today by industry professionals to access spot and historical quotations for a variety of cuts, as well as market projections, futures quotes, market commentary, news, and analytical tools such as User-Defined Relationships. Acquisition of the Yellow Sheet Urner Barry's Price-Current primarily focused on the poultry and egg market, with the Seafood Price-Current being introduced in 1973. In the early 1990s, Urner Barry acquired Yellow Sheet, a Red Meat quotation service similar to the Price-Current, from National Provisioner. This gave Urner Barry the ability to provide protein-focused market information to a variety of businesses.

Systems approach Many engineering disciplines engage in green engineering. This includes sustainable design, life cycle analysis (LCA), pollution prevention, design for the environment (DfE), design for disassembly (DfD), and design for recycling (DfR). As such, green engineering is a subset of sustainable engineering.https://doi.org/10.1021%2Facssuschemeng.8b02227 Green engineering involves four basic approaches to improve processes and products to make them more efficient from an environmental standpoint.D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, . # Waste reduction; # Materials management; # Pollution prevention; and, # Product enhancement. Green engineering approaches design from a systematic perspective which integrates numerous professional disciplines. In addition to all engineering disciplines, green engineering includes land use planning, architecture, landscape architecture, and other design fields, as well as the social sciences(e.g. to determine how various groups of people use products and services. Green engineers are concerned with space, the sense of place, viewing the site map as a set of fluxes across the boundary, and considering the combinations of these systems over larger regions, e.g. urban areas. The life cycle analysis is an important green engineering tool, which provides a holistic view of the entirety of a product, process or activity, encompassing raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, use, maintenance, recycling, and final disposal. Assessing its life cycle should yield a complete picture of the product. The first step in a life cycle assessment is to gather data on the flow of a material through an identifiable society. Once the quantities of various components of such a flow are known, the important functions and impacts of each step in the production, manufacture, use, and recovery/disposal are estimated. In sustainable design, engineers must optimize for variables that give the best performance in temporal frames.D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008). The system approach employed in green engineering is similar to value engineering (VE). Daniel A. Vallero has compared green engineering to be a form of VE because both systems require that all elements and linkages within the overall project be considered to enhance the value of the project. Every component and step of the system must be challenged. Ascertaining overall value is determined not only be a project's cost-effectiveness, but other values, including environmental and public health factors. Thus, the broader sense of VE is compatible with and can be identical to green engineering, since VE is aimed at effectiveness, not just efficiency, i.e. a project is designed to achieve multiple objectives, without sacrificing any important values. Efficiency is an engineering and thermodynamic term for the ratio of an input to an output of energy and mass within a system. As the ratio approaches 100%, the system becomes more efficient. Effectiveness requires that efficiencies be met for each component, but also that the integration of components lead to an effective, multiple value-based design.D. Vallero (2003). Engineering the Risks of Hazardous Wastes. Butterworth-Heinemann, Amsterdam, Netherlands and Boston MA, . Green engineering is also a type of concurrent engineering, since tasks must be parallelized to achieve multiple design objectives.

Work Guardroom interior with armour and a standard behind He is mainly known for his genre scenes and still lifes but also painted mythological and Christian religious scenes. His still lifes are mainly still lifes of armour in addition to a few hunting pieces. He was specialized in 'guardroom scenes', a type of genre scene that had become popular in the mid-17th century, particularly in the Dutch Republic. In Flanders there were also a few practitioners of the genre including David Teniers the Younger, Abraham Teniers, Tijssens' master Anton Goubau, Cornelis Mahu and Gillis van Tilborch. A guard room scene typically depicts an interior scene with officers and soldiers engaged in merrymaking. Guardroom scenes often included mercenaries and prostitutes dividing booty, harassing captives or indulging in other forms of reprehensible activities.Review of Jochai Rosen, Soldiers at Leisure, The Guardroom Scene in Dutch Genre Painting of the Golden Age at historians of Netherlandish art Tilborch painted a Guardroom Interior with Armour and a Standard Behind (sold at Sotheby's on 10 July 2004 in London, lot 172), which depicts two soldiers and a woman drinking and smoking in a room. The soldiers are almost completely hidden behind a pile of weapons and a war standard. In its general arrangement and specific details such as the figures and the armour on the floor the painting is based on the signed composition of Tijssens' master Anton Goubau in the National Gallery in Prague. The Goubau painting continues to the left into a horizontal composition. It is likely that Tijssens' painting was cut down as on the extreme left margin the nose, moustache and chin of the figure next to the woman are visible. The original painting may therefore have been similar in composition to that of Goubau. Jan Baptist Tijssens the Younger (c. 1657-after 1723), Guardroom Interior with Armour and a Standard Behind at Sotheby's The armour depicted in the picture was already out of date at the time it was painted since metal armours, breast plates and helmets fell out of use from the 1620s.Gillis II van Tilborgh, Guardroom scene at Jean Moust It is possible that in line with the moralizing intent of the genre, the armour is a reference to the vanitas motif of the transience of power and fame.Guardroom painting at the Kurpf√§lzisches Museum in Heidelberg References External links Category:1660 births Category:1723 deaths Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish genre painters Category:Flemish still life painters Category:Flemish art dealers Category:People from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Jan Baptist Tijssens the Younger"},{"id":"44818031","title":"List of USM Alger records and statistics"},{"id":"44818033","text":"Spreading My Wings is the debut studio album from American rock band World Fire Brigade.

Markets and law Hay carts in Cumberland Market, painted by Robert Polhill Bevan in 1915 Hay and straw were important commodities in the pre-industrial era. Hay was required as fodder for animals, especially horses, and straw was used for a variety of purposes including bedding. In London, there were established markets for hay at Smithfield, Whitechapel and by the village of Charing, which is still now called the Haymarket. The weight of trusses was regulated by law and statutes were passed in the reigns of William III and Mary II, George II and George III. The latter act of 1796 established the weights as follows:In summary then, the standard weights of a truss were: * new hay, 60 pounds * old hay, 56 pounds * straw, 36 pounds and 36 trusses made up a load.

Though he made his film debut as himself in a cameo in Broadway After Dark (1924), the bulk of his movie career was spent in shorts made between 1929 and 1938. He made only one more film, in 1949. West's television career consisted of two appearances as a dancer on The Frank Sinatra Show in 1951, and appeared in single episodes on Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Lucy Show in the 1960s. In 1944, he co-starred with Jackie Gleason in the musical Follow the Girls, a smash hit that ran for 888 performances. His next (and last) Broadway appearance was in another smash, The Pajama Game, when he replaced Eddie Foy Jr. in one of the leads. Personal life West was married to the acrobatic dancer and film actress Lucille Page, with whom he appeared with in vaudeville in Berdell and Wellington and in the short Moonlight and Melody (1935). Lucille died in 1964, while Buster died in 1966 from brain cancer. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.

His father, Alois Strohmayer (1822-1890) was a composer.Anton Strohmayer's grave in Vienna Strohmayer studied the guitar with his father Alois. As a boy, he already had similar ability to the brothers Johann and Josef Schrammel, two renowned Austrian guitarists who were taken in by his father to play guitar in restaurants across the city. At age 12, Strohmayer was taken by his father to play, for the first time at the \\"Green Hunter\\" in the Prater.

The album was released in 2013 on The Ex's own label. Background Emerging as an anarchist punk rock quartet in 1979, The Ex began to frequently work with jazz musicians within their first decade. Their 1989 album Joggers and Smoggers, 1995's Instant, and the singles series the band released between 1991 and 1992 featured extensive collaborations with members of the dutch free jazz ensemble Instant Composers Pool, and 2001's Een Rondje Holland presented a larger horn section as part of the band's Ex Orkest. As the band developed their repertoire into the 21st century, they turned their attentions to Ethiojazz and were backing Addis Ababa saxophonist Getachew Mekurya on world tours and for his 2006 album Moa Anbessa with French, Dutch, and Canadian musicians Xavier Charles, Joost Buis, and Brodie West on clarinet, trombone and alto saxophone. The Ex's 2010 album Catch My Shoe featured trumpet work by Italy's Roy Paci, and when The Ex returned to record a final album with Mekurya in 2012, they were joined by Chicago reed player Ken Vandermark, as well as Buis, Charles, West and Wierbos. Amidst these collaborations with The Ex, a new international collective of horn players gradually formed and by 2010 adopted the name \\"Brass Unbound\\" after Johan van der Keuken's 1993 film of the same name. In his film, van der Keuken follows the development of the European brass band tradition in the former Dutch colonies to include traditional marching bands to more hybridized forms brass music that combine European instruments with Ghanaian rhythms. Independent of concerts with Getatchew Mekurya, Brass Unbound began touring as a live act with The Ex in 2010. For these concerts, the ensemble wrote and improvised new material, as well as reworkings of songs from The Ex's catalog. Songs Released in 2013, Enormous Door catalogues The Ex's material with Brass Unbound. The songs \\"Bicycle Illusion\\" from their first album with vocalist Arnold De Boer and \\"Our Leaky Homes\\" from a 2011 single rearrange their songs to make space for horn parts.

Poblacion, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental, Philippines. The parish church, under the patronage of Saint John the Baptist, is under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ozamiz. The church was declared a National Cultural Treasure of the Philippines in 2001. Parish History The town of Jimenez was originally established by the Augustinian Recollects in 1829 and with Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary as its patron saint. The present church, built mostly from hewn coral stone, was erected in the 19th century on a site previously settled by the Subanons, a local tribe. The erection of the church structure is attributed to Father Roque Azcona between the years 1862 to 1863. The church was believed to have been completed in the late 1880s. Architecture The church is predominantly Baroque in architecture with features reminiscent of the Renaissance style. The church fa√ßade, contrary to other Roman Catholic churches of the same era, is devoid of a pediment. It features a portico with three semicircular arched entrances lined on top with a parapet. The rectangular mass of the portico is crowned by three pedimented saints‚Äô niches. Behind the fa√ßade is the nave wall with its simple, gabled roof and windows. To the left of the church stands the rectangular, three-tiered bell tower topped with finials, a domed roof and a lantern. The clock mechanism are still intact. Interiors The interiors of the church is reportedly one of the best preserved interior of a Roman Catholic church in Mindanao. It features a painting done in 1898 and portions made of tabique pampango, a local version of a dry wall using panels of interwoven slats or branches and covered with lime.

He is considered by many as a controversial figure in modern Iraqi literature due to his advocacy of freedom and opposition to imperialism and is known as a poet of freedom. Birth and early life in Baghdad Maruf al Rusafi is known to have born in 1875 (his birth date has also been reported as 1 January 1877) at Al Rusafa in Baghdad in Iraq in a family of meagre financial means. His father, Abdul Gani, hailing from the Jibara tribe of Kurdish area, died while he was a child and was brought up by his mother, Fathima who was of Turkish ancestry. His early schooling was at the local Madrasa. Aspiring for a military career he joined Al Rushdiyya Military School in Baghdad, but had to leave after three years, having failed the grade. He continued his studies in Religion and Linguistics under an Arabic scholar, Shaikh Mahmud Shukri al Alusi and stayed there for twelve years where he had the opportunity to learn Sufism, Linguistics, Islamic principles and general sciences. After the completion of his studies, Rusafi started working as a teacher of Arabic at an elementary school run by one of his teachers, in Al Rashdiyya, and later, in 1902, moved to a secondary school in Baghdad. Life in Turkey and Syria Al Rusafi left for Turkey of the post Young Turk Revolution, in 1908, and started working in Istanbul as an Arabic lecturer at the Royal College. He worked at a local newspaper, Sabil al Rashad and is known to have led an active social life. In 1912, he became a member of the Turkish Chamber of Deputies, representing Al Muthanna district of Iraq and was re-elected in 1914. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, Al Rusafi left Istanbul for Syria as the British authorities in Iraq prevented the return of Iraqis from Turkey. He settled in Damascus in 1919 and started teaching there, but only for a short time of less than one year. The local government of Syria, under Amir Faisal who was the son of the Sherif of Mecca, was also reluctant to accept Rusafi due to Rusafi's opposition of the Arab Congress of 1913 held in Paris and the revolt of 1916 initiated by the Sherif of Mecca.  Brief stay in Jerusalem Bronze stature of Maruf al Rusafi near Martyr's Bridge, Baghdad The British local government under Gilbert Clayton reportedly in an attempt to keep Al Rusafi away from Iraq, offered him a job at the Teachers' Training College (Dar al-Mu‚Äôallimin), through Muhammad Kurd Ali, an acquaintant of Al Rusafi who went on to become the president of the Arab Academy of Damascus. Ma'ruf al Rusafi reached Jerusalem in 1920 and resumed his career as a teacher of Arabic literature at the training college. During his stay in Jerusalem, Rusafi had the opportunity to associate himself with such literary figures as Issaf Nashashibi, the principal of the training college and in whose name, Issaf Nashashibi Center for Culture and Literature was established in 1982, Adil Jabr, the assistant director of education, Khalil al-Sakakini, an Arab nationalist and Nakhlah Zuraiq, an Arabic faculty member at the English College in Jerusalem. The association also provided Rusafi with opportunity to recite his poems at the gatherings and pursue his literary career. In 1920, when Sir Herbert Samuel, a British Jewish diplomat, was appointed the High Commissioner of Palestine, he made a declaration at the Palestine Arab Congress held at Haifa that a higher college of Arab studies would be established in Jerusalem, a promise never fulfilled. Rusafi, who was also an attendee at the Congress, later wrote in praise of the declaration, an act which is reported to have placed him in disfavour of the Arab nationalists and his students. Though Rusafi tried to pacify the situation by publishing an explanation in the local daily, Mir‚Äôat ash-Sharq, his efforts were not successful. A month after the controversy, when the supporters of Talib Pasha al Naqiq, a candidate at the Iraqi elections of 1921, decided to launch a newspaper, Rusafi is reported to have been invited to head the publication. Rusafi left Jerusalem in March 1921, ending his stay of 18 months there. Return to Iraq Rusafi is reported to have reached Baghdad on 9 April 1921 and there is unconfirmed reports of him being arrested a few days later. However, it is known that he started a newspaper, Al Amal but the daily had a short life. In 1923, he joined the committee for translation and arabization as its vice chairman, and in 1924, he became an inspector in the Directorate of Education where he worked till 1927. The next move was as the professor of Arabic at the Higher Teachers Institute in 1927. In 1930, he was elected to the Parliament but continued his teaching job till 1937, after which his life is known to be in isolation. Reports are available that Rusafi spent his last days in poverty, working in a tobacco shop in Baghdad. He died on 16 March 1945. A bronze statue of Maruf Al Rusafi has been erected at the Rashid Street intersection, in Baghdad, near Souq al Sarai. Political and social activism Maruf Rusafi is known to have used his writing to bring out the social and political issues of the Middle East society, especially Iraqi society. His writings during his stay in Turkey are reported to be commentaries on the Ottoman period. He is regarded by many as the founder of the social school of poetry in Iraq. He is also known to have written in defence of women and widows and is seen as a strong advocate of education and knowledge. Some of his poems have been critical of the British occupation of Iraq of 1920, in the wake of the rise of King Faisal I to power after the World War I. Khalid Muhammed Hafiz, erstwhile judge of Faluja had a collection of manuscripts about his interaction with Rusafi which revealed Rusafi as moderate in his religious beliefs. The manuscript was later published by Yousuf Izz ad Deen, along with his own critical study of Rusafi's poems, as a book, Al-Rusafi Yarwi Seerat Hayatih. Literary works He has written many pieces, one of which was important towards society and politics. One of his poems, 'A Praise to the Development of the Future' talked about how \\"people are too proud of their history rather than developing their future.\\" Maruf Rusafi was acquainted with western literature through Turkish translations and his writing career started while he was in Istanbul by way of socio political articles in journals such as Al Muqtataf and Al Muayyad, published from Syria and Egypt.

The front axle was suspension with leaf springs, using a central axle air suspension, rear axle uses pneumatic suspension with membrane.  Production and operation  In 1960, a single prototype (the first Czechoslovak articulated bus) was made, but mass production never started. The prototype was tested starting in 1961 at ƒåSAD Praha, both on suburban routes (e.g. Prague - Horn√≠ Poƒçernice) and long distance lines (e.g. Prague - Pec pod Snƒõ≈ækou). In trial runs with passengers, the prototype proved successful; the only complaints from drivers concerned a weak engine that had problems when the bus was fully occupied. In 1966, the bus was apparently handed over to the enterprise Chirana Brno, which scrapped it in 1969. After the failure of the production of articulated RTO buses in Czechoslovakia, serial production began in large numbers under a license in Poland (like standard buses ≈†koda 706 RTO). Buses were produced initially as Jelcz AP 02 (a little longer than 706 RTO-K), then Jelcz AP 021 (a little smaller than 706 RTO-K) was released and produced until 1975.

The lighthouse is situated on a hill at the north-eastern end of the island, and along with the other lights at Pechiguera and Tost√≥n, marks the La Bocayna strait that separates Lanzarote from Fuerteventura.  History  The lighthouse was opened in 1865, making it one of the oldest in the Canaries. Built in a similar style to other Canarian 19th-century lights, it consists of a painted single storey house, with dark volcanic rock used for the masonry detailing. A six-metre-high () masonry tower is attached to the seaward side of the house. View from pathway to the lighthouse The sixth order light was originally powered by olive oil, and gave a steady red light that had a range of 9 miles. In 1883, the oil-powered lamp was replaced by one that ran on paraffin, and then in 1923 this was superseded by an acetylene lamp, that provided a longer range, and flashed twice every five seconds. An automatic sun valve was also added, to save the keeper having to light and extinguish the lamp, each day at dusk and dawn. A system of solar panels and batteries now provide the power for a 150-watt electric halogen lamp, which has a reach of 14 nautical miles. When the lighthouse was automated in the 1960s the keeper and his family were the last to leave the island, which now has no permanent residents. The area around the lighthouse can be reached by following the marked 3.5 km footpath from the ferry landing; although the site is accessible, the tower and buildings are closed.

He died in Landerneau on 11 January 1913. Biography Yann Larc'hantec or Yann Larhantec was born on 30 May 1829 in Plougonven and died on 11 January 1913 in Landerneau. He was the son of farmers Jean-Marie and Fran√ßoise Guillou. He spent most of his life in Morlaix and most of his work involved crosses and calvaries and he was entrusted with the repair and restoration of many of the great Breton calvaries of the 15th and 16th centuries. His main works are listed below. Main works ;Note: \\"Enclos paroissial\\" In the text below there are several references to an \\"enclos paroissial\\" and this French term can be translated as parish close. These are not uncommon in Finist√®re and were built in the 16th and 17th centuries. The enclosure comprises an elaborately decorated parish church surrounded by an entirely walled churchyard with gateway, often an arched gateway. In England cathedral closes for example, include many residential and administrative buildings, as well as the church, but Breton Parish closes contained only buildings and structures designed for worship: the church itself, a calvary, and sometimes an ossuary or charnel house with chapel and a cemetery. The calvaries of such church enclosures are significant works of popular art and more often than not they display Christ and the two thieves whilst at the base many feature relief panels, free-standing sculptural groups or both. These groups depict onlookers of the crucifixion and nearly always include the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist, but also many other heroes and villains ‚Äì sometimes including local or national magnates. The ossuaries in such enclosures are often of large proportions and some were intended to contain large sculptures or paintings, frequently of the Deposition or Entombment of Christ. In most cases the bones have been moved from the ossuary to the cemetery although a few still hold skeletal remains. Calvary at Saint- Th√©gonnec Apart from the Grand Calvaire at Saint-Th√©gonnec (see Saint- Th√©gonnec Parish close) there is a second calvary constructed in 1864 with statues by Yann Larhantec of the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist. This calvary is set into the enclosure wall and accessed by a double stairway.

Pleyben's \\"Croix de cimeti√®re\\" This cross by Larhantec dates to 1869. The pedestal has reliefs depicting instruments of the passion. The cross carries inscriptions remembering particular \\"missions\\" or pilgrimages; that of 1869, 1906 and 1924. The cross is located in the cemetery. The Calvary at Clohars-Carno√´t Clohars-Carno√´t has many sculptures dating back to the 16th and 17th century but Larhantec was responsible for the two \\"croix de mission\\" dating to 1879 and 1901. The \\"Croix de Mission\\" of Kerlouan This cross is situated near the Saint Anne chapel in Kerlouan's Square d'Orschwir. It was sculpted in Kersanton granite and on the four faces of the pedestal Larhantec has carved depictions of the passion. Plaques mention the missions of 1911 and 1925. √âglise Saint-Jean-Baptiste de la Feuill√©e √âglise Saint-Jean- Baptiste de la Feuill√©e altar Larhantec executed statues in white marble for the altar of this Plougonven church in 1866. The Calvary of Plougourvest Located in Plougourvest's cemetery this Larhantec Calvary dates to 1870. \\"La croix de Br√©zal\\" In 1895/1896 Albert Le Roux, the owner of Br√©zal, commissioned Larhantec to execute this cross at Ploun√©venter Esquibien Yan Larhantec completed this Calvary in 1868. It is 7 metres high. The Calvary at Saint-Vougay Larhantec executed this Calvary in 1866. It is known as \\"La croix de Traon-Meur\\" and is 7 metres in height. A plaque makes reference to the mission of 1866. The calvary is located in the cemetery. The Calvary at Locquirec Larhantec's Calvary and Locquirec's church A Larhantec Calvary of 5.50 metres dating to 1891 stands outside the Saint Jacque church in Locquirec. The figures placed under the Cross represent John the Evangelist back to back with Saint Roch and the Virgin Mary back to back with Saint Peter. Also included are two horned grimacing devils. The \\"calvaire du cimeti√®re\\" at Landivisiau Larhantec's 7 metre high Calvary in Landivisiau's cemetery dates to 1865. Bears the inscription The Calvary at Confort-Meilars The Calvary at the √âglise Notre-Dame de Confort in Meilars- Confort The √âglise Notre-Dame de Confort at Confort-Meilars dates back to 1528 and 1544 and the Calvary stands near the west porch. The Calvary was decorated with statues of the apostles but these were broken during the French revolution and then lost their heads in 1849. These were subsequently restored and placed in some unused niches on the west fa√ßade of the church. In 1870 Yan Larc'hantec executed several 1.70 metre high statues for the Calvary. The figure of Christ was hit by lightning in 1978 and restored by Pierre Floch. The \\"Calvaire du Croissant\\" at Lothey This Calvary by Larhantec dates to 1899 and the pedestal carries the inscription Fran√ßois-Louis Soubigou In 1903, Lanhartec sculpted a relief depicting Soubigou for the family grave in Ploun√©venter's cemetery. √âglise Saint-Yves de Plougonven Statue de Bernard Fran√ßois Marie Le Teurnier Plougonven's parish church in the Tr√©gor region was built in the early 16th century in the flamboyant gothic style. The church together with the Calvary and a burial chapel and ossuary are grouped together in the \\"enclos paroissial de Plougonven\\". It has been classified as a \\"monument historiques\\" since 7 March 1916. The church's altars were fashioned from Kersanton stone by Larhantec. The Calvary, regarded as one of Brittany's finest, dates to 1554 and was the creation of Bastien and Henry Prigent. Many of the Prigent sculptures were destroyed during the Terror and in 1897 Larhantec reconstructed the crucifixion cross. Amongst those included in the sculptural composition are Saint Yves a much venerated Saint in Brittany and Satan (\\"Le Diable de la tentation\\") and the three kings Balthazar, Melchior and Gaspard. The chapel has sober lines in contrast to the flamboyance of the church and the ossuary contains the tomb of the Abb√© Le Teurnier decorated with the Abbe's statue sculpted by Larhantec. Several photographs of the Prigent calvary can be seen in the gallery below. Detail from the Plougonven calvary. Jesus is taken into custody The parish church of Saint-Pierre The Poulgar Calvary. Roland Dor√©'s St John can be seen to the right of the Cross This church in Plougar has a Calvary in its graveyard sculpted by Larhantec with statues of the Virgin Mary and St John on either side of the Cross bearing the crucified Jesus. The statue of St John is in fact a Roland Dor√© work which dates back to the early 17th Century. The inscription near the cross reads The War Memorial of Saint-Pol-de-L√©on Saint-Pol-de-L√©on war memorial with calvary by Larhantec and Ren√© Quillivic's remarkable central sculpture This war memorial by Ren√© Quillivic is reckoned to be Finist√®re's first memorial to the dead of the 1914-1918 war and was placed in front of the existing Larhantec calvary and a semi-circular wall decorated with a \\"Chemin de croix\\" by Donnart. Calvaries at Guiclan Several Larhantec works can be seen in Guiclan. His calvary of 1884 in north Guiclan is 7 metres high and is inscribed \\"40 JOURS D‚ÄôINDULGENCES EN DISANT 5 PATER ET 5 AVE\\".

Biography  Childhood Born in 1922 in Jiangsu province, Xiao moved to Shanghai with her parents when she was 4 years old. She was nicknamed ‚ÄúLittle Bundle of Joy‚Äù as a child. Soon after she came to Shanghai she was sold to the Zhang family. She went to study in the school for 2 and one-half years. The headmaster of the school gave her the official name of Zhang Shiqing, which means someone hardworking and very cultured. Joy was sold again when she was 10 years old because her adoptive parents both passed away from illness. This time Joy was sold to Liu family which owned a theater and rickshaw company in Shanghai. The Liu's believed that Joy was a jinx which brought bad luck to people. So Joy was given away to the Jing family who were one of the most powerful criminal families in Shanghai, and Joy had to serve Madame Jing. She was polite and hardworking, so finally Madame Jing wanted to keep her officially as a servant forever. This time the Liu's felt a bit of regret because it would mean they had to give away the hard-working girl. On the other hand, they also felt frightened that Joy would bring bad luck to Madame Jing, and it would bring them tremendous trouble. So they found an excuse to bring Joy back. Stage career At the Liu's theater Joy started to learn how to act. Everyday when she finished her chores in the theater, she went to the backstage to see how opera actors did rehearsal. Some actors knew of her miserable life so they felt sorry for her. They were kind enough to teach her a bit because of her respectful manners. Joy learned different kinds of local operas, martial arts and acrobatics. One of the masters performing at the theater Ming Le gave her the stage name 'Xiao Wenyan'. In those years she became familiar with several genres of opera, and she was able to see Peking Opera, Kun Opera, Huai Opera, and Hui Opera. She took the opportunity of play operas along with famous Peking Opera artists such as Li Hui Fang at the theater Ming Le. In 1938 she started performing the work The Story of Two Butterflies at the theater. Her skills were increasing and she gained the confidence to develop her own style, which she named ‚Äúfree style melody ‚Äù. She was involved in reforming acting styles. This revolutionary style brought her success and promptly her fame spread throughout Shanghai and the neighboring provinces. During 1946 she continued performing in several theaters and participated in the third edition of the Shanghai Theater Festival with the play The River of Reed Flowers. Here she obtained a very positive review from writers such as Tian Han and Hong Sheng. In October 1947 she acted voluntarily for an event organized by Song Qingling, the wife of Sun Yat-sen and later she performed at the theater Tianchan to celebrate the 82nd birthday of Sun Yat-sen. In 1952 she was invited to participate in the National Competition for Study the Opera in Beijing. She performed in a special session for the Chairman Mao, President Liu Shaoqi and Prime Minister Zhou Enlai. In a national competition she won the First Prize and several other prizes. 1953 she joined an artist group and went to North Korea to greet and perform for the Chinese troops for 57 days. She had the lead roles in two films, Rendezvous at Blue-Bridge (Lan Qiao hui) filmed in 1954, and (N√º Shen) Female Trial was filmed in 1960. In 1964 she played a leading role in a Chinese modern Huai opera: One morning in the Docks. Afterwards it was adapted to a Peking model opera: On the Docks. Later years When in 1966 the Cultural Revolution began, she was accused of being anti-party, anti-socialism, etc. and was sent to work in a cowshed. When after three years was freed, she performed in a modern play, and again was accused of being a follower of the ‚Äúblack line‚Äù, so she was sent to a re- education camp. In 1989 she was awarded the Gold Medal in the National Record given in Beijing. In 2006 she was invited to be celebrated and commemorated at the centenary of the Huai Opera in Shanghai. She died after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage on September 19, 2013 in Shanghai.

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Ian Brennan, and first aired on January 23, 2015 on Fox in the United States. It is the first part of a two- part episode which concluded on January 30, 2015 with the episode \\"The Hurt Locker, Part Two\\". The episode takes place as Principal Sue Sylvester organizes an event between New Directions and rival show choir groups Vocal Adrenaline and the Warblers. Sue has ulterior motives though, and hypnotizes Sam Evans to carry out her plans which includes creating a false relationship between Sam and Rachel Berry, and creating discord for her old rival Will Schuester. Plot Principal Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) invites Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), now coach of Vocal Adrenaline, back to McKinley High to end the dispute between them, but finds him so annoying that she vows to continue to fight. She invites Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) to a storage locker she has named her \\"hurt locker\\" where it is revealed that she has been secretly encouraging the relationship between Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and his former fiance Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), and that she is working towards getting them back together. Sue tells Kurt that she has organized an invitational of other show choirs in order to sabotage New Directions. As Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Will discuss the event, Rachel is concerned that it will cause her fledgeling group to lose confidence and implies that Will should sabotage his group in order to help her, while their conversation is being secretly recorded by Sue. Sue then quickly hypnotizes Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) with keywords to make him feel love towards Rachel, kiss her, then wake up and not remember anything. Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) tells Rachel and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) that the Warblers will not go easy on them, but is called away when his new boyfriend Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) discovers a live bear cub in their apartment. Rachel and Sam have dinner together as Rachel states a keyword from Sam's hypnosis, and he begins to flatter her. Kurt blames Sue for putting the bear in the apartment which she admits to. Blaine gives piano lessons to Sam and Rachel but it is broken up by Sue who implants another keyword to Sam. Blaine and Dave go out to dinner and run into multiple ex-boyfriends of Dave, all of whom are larger, burly gay men (aka bears). Sue comes in and discloses that she has set this up, then shows them a genealogy tree which shows that Blaine and Dave are third cousins. Sue visits Carmel High, where Vocal Adrenaline is from, and meets the principal Abigail Figgins-Gunderson (Iqbal Theba), who is the sister of Principal Figgins, and Sue shows her the video of Will and Rachel. Rachel and Kurt give a pep talk to New Directions members Jane Hayward (Samantha Marie Ware), Roderick (Noah Guthrie), Mason McCarthy (Billy Lewis Jr.) and Madison McCarthy (Laura Dreyfuss) about the invitational, and they all realize that their chances are dim since they do not even have the proper number of members for a true show choir. Will confronts Sue about her sabotage to which she admits while lavishly telling Will about her disdain for him. Will vows to ensure New Directions will continue after Sue is gone. Kurt and Blaine discuss Sue's attempts to break up Blaine and Dave, as Kurt states he has a date with a new guy later, which causes Blaine to act awkwardly. Rachel and Sam continue their piano lessons while flirting with each other which leads to them kissing. The next day, Sam does not remember any of their actions. Sue then re-hypnotizes Sam to both continue his charade and also steal Will's mail. Kurt goes on his date and meets Walter (Harry Hamlin), a much older man who has only recently come out as gay and had a former wife and kids, and after much awkwardness they agree to start off as friends. Will encounters Sam attempting to steal his mail, as Sam, under hypnosis, tells Will that Rachel told him to do so. Angered at this, Will tells Vocal Adrenaline, led by Clint (Max George), to go all out for the invitational, but they are unaccepting of his teaching style. Vocal Adrenaline performs well and intimidates Kurt, Rachel, and the rest of New Directions and the Warblers, while Sue watches with pride. Production Returning recurring characters that appear in the episode include Iqbal Theba as both Principal Figgins and his twin sister Abigail Figgins-Gunderson, Max Adler as Dave Karofsky, Max George as Clint, Lauren Potter as Becky Jackson, Samantha Marie Ware as Jane Hayward, Noah Guthrie as Roderick, Billy Lewis Jr. as Mason McCarthy, and Laura Dreyfuss as Madison McCarthy.

He attained the rank of Major General and was prominent for serving in several United States Army Air Forces command positions during World War II. Early life and start of career Walter R. Weaver was born in Charleston, South Carolina on February 23, 1885, while his father, Erasmus M. Weaver, Jr., was assigned to The Citadel as a Professor of Military Science. The younger Weaver attended the Virginia Military Institute in preparation for a military career. He left after his third year in order to accept an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He graduated in 1908, received his commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Infantry, and was assigned to the 11th Infantry Regiment at Fort D. A. Russell, Wyoming. Weaver's subsequent assignments included: The 28th Infantry Regiment at Fort Snelling, Minnesota; Aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Eli D. Hoyle in the Philippines; and the 15th Infantry Regiment in Tientsin, China. Upon returning to the United States in 1915, Weaver carried out assignments at Columbus Barracks, Ohio and Fort Thomas, Kentucky. World War I At the beginning of World War I Weaver transferred to the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps, and was initially assigned as Commandant of Flying Cadets at Wilbur Wright Field, Ohio, receiving promotion to Major. Weaver was subsequently assigned as the first commander of the Aviation Mechanical School in St. Paul, Minnesota. While en route, he learned that 500 students were already traveling to the site, but that the school was being formed so quickly that there were no plans for housing, feeding or instructional facilities. Within two days, he had secured the use of a Willys-Overland factory building via a verbal agreement with the company president, cleared the site of over 3,000 stored automobiles using volunteer labor, and supervised the installation of bunks, classrooms and mess halls. On the third day after his arrival, the school was operational and the arriving students were able to begin their instruction as scheduled. He continued in command until the end of the war, and supervised the education of thousands of soldiers who served as airplane mechanics in the United States and Europe. Post-World War I After the war Weaver was assigned as Chief of the Supply Group in the Office of the Director of the Army Air Service. In 1920 and 1921 he completed flight training at Kelly Field, Texas, and March Field, California, and received his qualification as a pilot. In 1922 Weaver was assigned to command of Mitchel Field, New York. This site had become rundown as the result of budget cutbacks and force reductions following the war. Weaver supervised an overhaul, and within a year, buildings had been repaired, hangars had floors installed, and aircraft parking ramps and aprons had been paved. Weaver's assignments following Mitchel Field included command of Hanscom Field, Massachusetts, Middletown Air Depot, Pennsylvania, and Maxwell Field, Alabama. He graduated from the Army Industrial College in 1932, and then served as Chief of the Plans Division and Chief of the Information Division in the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps. In 1934 he was assigned to New York City as the Procurement Planning Representative of the Air Corps. In 1935 the Air Corps created a separate headquarters at Langley Field, Virginia, and Weaver was assigned as Inspector General. From 1937 to 1939 he was the commander of Langley Field. Weaver was assigned to command of the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field in 1939. In this position he was responsible for developing doctrine and tactical training for pilots and air crews in advance of World War II. World War II In 1940 the Army Air Forces began to expand in preparation for war and Weaver was assigned to command the Southeast Air Corps Training Center at Maxwell Field, receiving promotion to Brigadier General. In this assignment he oversaw the training of thousands of pilots and flight crew members who served in all theaters of the war. In July, 1941 Weaver was promoted to Major General. Weaver was the acting Chief of the Air Corps from December 1941 until March 1942. As acting Chief he supervised completion of a reorganization and expansion plan for the Air Corps, including its re-designation as the Army Air Forces. This reorganization included the creation of the Technical Training Command in South Carolina, which Weaver was assigned to command. As part of his effort to create basic training centers and officer candidate schools for new recruits, Weaver arranged for the use of resort hotels in Atlantic City, Miami Beach, St. Petersburg, and Chicago, arguing successfully that these facilities, then being underused because people were unable to take vacations during the war, were the only ones that were vacant and large enough for the needs of the military. In July 1943 Weaver's health began to fail as the result of overexertion required by his wartime command, and he was retired for physical disability. He then continued to aid the war effort as a consultant with the Aviation Corporation, a manufacturer of airplanes and airplane parts. Death and burial Weaver's health continued to fail, and he died at Walter Reed Hospital on October 27, 1944. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section South, Site 1908. Family In 1911 Weaver married Elizabeth K. Johnson (1891-1978), the daughter of a railroad executive. They had no children. Awards and decorations Weaver was a recipient of the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his World War II service. Legacy The Major General Walter Reed Weaver, an Air Forces Floating Maintenance Unit ship, was named for him. It was deployed to the Pacific Theater during World War II.

Johann Schrammel  Life  Johann was the illegitimate son of the clarinettist Kaspar Schrammel and his late wife Aloisia Ernst; his younger brother Josef Schrammel was in a similar situation. He also had an older half- brother named Konrad Schrammel (1833‚Äì1905), who had a less prestigious livelihood as a barrel organ player as he was forced to retire as an \\"invalid\\" from military service. In his first musical lessons Schrammel got together with his brother, with assistance from his father. With approximately six years, Johann Schrammel could sing in the church choir in his home town Neulerchenfeld. His father had helped him receive violin lessons from Ernst Melzer despite a poor financial position. On 6January 1861, Johann Schrammel debuted along with his brother and father at a concert at the local inn \\"Zum goldenen Stuck\\" at the Neulerchenfelder Stra√üe. From 1862‚Äì63 he and his two brothers studied music at the Vienna Conservatory. In addition to singing lessons, the violin was taken up by Josef Schrammel. In June 1865 Johann Schrammel left the Conservatory, and unsecured sources claim that he was at that time already a member of the orchestra of Danzers Orpheum, Harmonietheater. In 1872 he married Rosalia Weichselbaumer and had 13 children with her; 9 of which survived childhood. In 1878 he founded with his brother Josef Schrammel and Anton Strohmayer a trio; they were later joined by the clarinettist Georg Danzer to form the famous Schrammel Quartet. Johann Schrammel died at age 43 and was awarded an honorary grave in the Hernalser Cemetery.

He's also the younger brother of Texas legend, and sporting goods company CEO, William \\"Rooster\\" Andrews. In 1997, he was inducted into the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame as a special category inductee for his role as a great ambassador of the game. Early life Andrews played high school football at Wilson High School in Dallas with Bill Forester. Andrews was an outstanding quarterback and kicker who took his team to the state playoffs. College football As a freshman, Andrews developed a friendship with fellow freshman and future All- American and Pro Bowl participant Carlton Massey who became his favorite target on the freshman team. He was the back-up quarterback in 1951 and 52, but managed to play in 8 games in those two years at quarterback, defensive back and punt returner. Andrews entered the 1953 season as a team captain and starting quarterback, but sharing time with sophomore Charles Brewer. The Longhorns started the season ranked #11 in the country, but after losses to LSU and #15 Oklahoma in the first four games, Texas was unranked and Brewer was promoted to the starting role against Arkansas. Andrews backed him up for the remainder of the season. Despite playing the best game of his career against Arkansas, throwing the only touchdown pass and leading the team in passing yards, his playing time continued to drop. By the end of the season he was barely taking the field, playing in only one of the last three games, but he made that one count. In his last game he threw only one complete pass, the longest of his career, a 49-yard touchdown pass that proved the game winning score against TCU. He finished his career at 2-2 as a starting quarterback. Later life Andrews became a booster and supporter of football during a 40-year career as a sporting goods salesman, working with and for his brother Rooster. He remained involved in high school athletics and, as a result, was rewarded with induction into the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame as a special category inductee in 1997.

The attacks took place in the Chirang, Sonitpur and Kokrajhar districts on 23 December 2014. They have been attributed to the Songbijit faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland: NDFB(S). The Adivasi people of Assam are mostly tea plantation workers. They are famously known as Tea Tribe ; some of them are the descendants of labourers brought to Assam by the British colonial rulers, while others are relatively recent migrants from other parts of India. The NDFB claims to represent the Bodo people, who are native to Assam; it has fought a secessionist war with the government for the establishment of a Bodoland. Although a number of NDFB militants had agreed to a ceasefire and peace talks in the 2000s, the NDFB(S) faction led by I K Songbijit has refused to give up militancy. In May 2014, the government attributed a similar attack on Muslim migrants to NDFB(S) but NDFB denies. There are many other extremist groups but NDFB is easily blamed. The December attacks, described as one of the worst massacres in the history of North-East India, led to widespread protests by tribal people. The protests turned violent, leading to three more deaths at the hands of the police. The Adivasi people also killed 14 Bodos in retaliation. On 26 December, the Government of India declared the launch of Operation All Out to eliminate the Bodo militants and deployed as many as 9,000 soldiers of the Indian Army and the Central Reserve Police Force.  Background  The National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), a militant group, has been indulging in violence against outside settlers since the late 1990s. The group signed a ceasefire with the Indian government in 2005, but one of its factions ‚Äî NDFB(S), which is led by IK Songbijit ‚Äî has opposed peace talks with the government. NDFB(S) warned of retaliation when the Assam Police launched an operation against them. On 21 December 2014, the Assam Police killed two NDFB militants.  Violence  There has been arm conflict between NDFB and Government and between NDFB and Adivasi Cobra Force. After two NDFB cadre killed by Assam Police, Due to suspense of Adivasi villagers assistance to Assam Police for NDFB encounter, The NDFB militants attacked villagers at 6:25pm on 23 December 2014 in the three different districts of Assam: Kokrajhar district, Sonitpur district and Chirang district. They killed around 65 unarmed Adivasi, including 21 women and 18 children. The attacks happened during preparations for Christmas; most of the militants as well as adivasi victims were Christians. The next day thousands of Adivasi people marched in protest. At Dhekiajuli in Sonitpur district, the police fired rounds to disperse the crowd when the protest march turned violent. The police firing killed three Adivasi . In retaliation, the Adivasi killed three Bodo people in a village near Behali in Sonitpur district and further 14 Bodo People get killed by Adivasi. The total death toll reached 85. Both communities burned houses and damaged properties of each other at different parts of the state. The violence also spread to Udalguri district.  Aftermath  A curfew was imposed in parts of the three districts. 55 companies of central paramilitary forces were deployed. The investigation was assigned to the National Investigation Agency. The Home Minister of India, Rajnath Singh, along with the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, and the Minister of Tribal Affairs, Jual Oram, visited the state and met Assam's Chief Minister (Tarun Gogoi) and other officials. They reviewed the situation and agreed to necessary steps. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief and announced an ex-gratia of to each of the families of the dead and to the seriously injured, while the Assam government has announced ex-gratia of to families of the dead and to those injured. The Prime Minister's Office also announced to the Assam government. About 72,675 people had been shifted to relief camps by 26 December.  Operation All Out  :For Operation All Out Kashmir launched in 2017 see also Operation All Out (Kashmir) On 26 December 2014, the Indian Government declared that they had launched \\"Operation All Out\\" to eliminate the NDFB militants. This was declared by the Chief of the Army Staff, General Dalbir Singh Suhag, after meeting the Indian Home Minister, Rajnath Singh, on 26 December. About 5,000 personnel from the paramilitary CRPF and 4,620 from the Indian Army have already been deployed and have been ordered to eliminate the remaining militants, who are estimated to number around 80. In addition, around 2,000 personnel from the border force Sashastra Seema Bal have been deployed to help maintain stability. The Indian Army has been using its helicopters to carry out aerial surveys of the affected regions.  Peace between two communities  A joint delegation of the All Bodo Students‚Äô Union (ABSU) and the All Adivasi Students‚Äô Association of Assam (AASAA), led by their presidents Pramode Boro and Raphael Kujur, visited the Bodo and Adivasi relief camps on Monday. They appealed to the inmates not to believe rumour- mongers, who were out to destroy unity among the people of the two communities. Both leaders demanded that the government ensure adequate security for the displaced villagers to return home and enable Bodo and Adivasi students to continue the new academic session beginning in January.

On September 3, 2014, Lizard Squad seemingly announced that it had disbanded only to return later on, claiming responsibility for a variety of attacks on prominent websites. The organization at one point participated in the Darkode hacking forums and shared hosting with them. On April 30, 2016, Cloudflare published a blogpost detailing how cyber criminals using this group's name were issuing random threats of carrying out DDoS attacks, despite these threats, Cloudflare claim they failed to carry through with a single attack. As a result of this, the City of London Police issued an alert warning businesses not to comply with ransom messages threatening DDoS attacks. Distributed denial-of-service attacks A distributed denial-of- service (DDoS) attack occurs when numerous systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. Such an attack is often the result of multiple systems (for example a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic. When a server is overloaded with connections, new connections can no longer be accepted.  Notable actions   League of Legends DDoS  On August 18, 2014, servers of the game League of Legends were taken offline with a DDoS attack; this was claimed as Lizard Squad's first attack.  Destiny DDoS  On November 23, 2014, Lizard Squad claimed they attacked Destiny servers with a DDoS attack.  PlayStation Network DDoS  On August 24, 2014 the PlayStation Network was disrupted via a DDoS attack, and again On December 8, with Lizard Squad claiming responsibility.  Xbox Live DDoS  On December 1, 2014, Xbox Live was apparently attacked by Lizard Squad: users attempting to connect to use the service would be given the 80151909 error code.  The Machinima Hack  On December 2, 2014, Lizard Squad hacked Machinima.com, replacing their front page with ASCII art of their logo.  North Korea DDoS  On December 22, 2014, Internet in North Korea was taken offline by a DDoS attack. Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for the attack and linked to an IP address located in North Korea. North Korean Internet services were restored on the 23 December 2014.  Christmas attacks  Lizard Squad had previously threatened to take down gaming services on Christmas. On December 25, 2014 (Christmas Day), Lizard Squad claimed to have performed a DDoS attack on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. On December 26, 2014 at 2:00 AM, Lizard Squad appeared to stop attacking PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. Gizmodo reported that the attacks may have ceased after Kim Dotcom offered Lizard Squad 3000 accounts on his upload service MEGA.  Tor sybil attack  On December 26, 2014, a Sybil attack involving more than 3000 relays was attempted against the Tor network. Nodes with names beginning with \\"LizardNSA\\" began appearing, Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for this attack. The relevance of the attack was questioned. According to Tor relay node operator Thomas White, the consensus system made that Lizard Squad only managed to control \\"0.2743% of the network, equivalent of a tiny VPS\\".  Malaysia Airlines website attack  On January 26, 2015, the website of Malaysia Airlines was attacked, apparently by Lizard Squad, calling itself a \\"cyber caliphate\\". Users were redirected to another page bearing an image of a tuxedo-wearing lizard, and reading \\"Hacked by Cyber Caliphate\\". Underneath this was text reading \\"follow the cyber caliphate on twitter\\" after which were the Twitter accounts of the owner of UMG, \\"@UMGRobert\\" and CEO of UMG, \\"@UMG_Chris\\". The page also carried the headline \\"404 - Plane Not Found\\", an apparent reference to the airline's loss of flight MH370 the previous year. Malaysia Airlines assured customers and clients that customer data had not been compromised.Malaysia Airlines website 'compromised' by 'cyber caliphate' Lizard Squad hackers, ABC News Australia, 26 Jan 2015 Media reports around the world said versions of the takeover in some regions included the wording \\"ISIS will prevail\\", which listed concerns of Lizard Squad's association with the Islamic State.  False claims   Bomb threats  On August 24, 2014, Lizard Squad claimed that a plane on which the president of Sony Online Entertainment, John Smedley, was flying (American Airlines Flight 362), had explosives on board. The flight from Dallas to San Diego made an unscheduled landing in Phoenix, Arizona. Sony Online Entertainment announced that the FBI was investigating the incident.  Facebook, Instagram, and Tinder attack  On January 26, 2015, several social media services including Facebook and Instagram were unavailable to users. Tinder and HipChat were also affected. Lizard Squad claimed responsibility for the attacks, via a posting on a Twitter account previously used by the group.Lizard Squad, Facebook, Instagram, Tinder, AIM, Hipchat #offline #LizardSquad, Twitter, January 26, 2015 The outage, originally speculated to be a distributed denial-of-service attack, lasted a little under an hour before services were restored.Hachman, Mark, Internet problems take out Facebook, Instagram, others; Lizard Squad takes credit, PC World, January 26, 2015 Facebook later released a statement saying its own engineers were to blame, and that the disruption to its services was not the result of a third- party attack, but instead occurred after they introduced a change that affected their configuration systems.  Explicit celebrity photos  On January 27, 2015, Lizard Squad claimed to have compromised Taylor Swift's Twitter and Instagram accounts. Once they claimed to have access, they threatened to release nude photos in exchange for bitcoins. Taylor Swift, however, retorted that \\"there were no naked pics\\" and told the offenders to \\"have fun\\" finding any.  Known members Vinnie Omari Vinnie Omari is a member of the Lizard Squad who was arrested and bailed under the alleged offences of \\"Enter into/concerned in acquisition/retention/use or control criminal property, Fraud by false representation - Fraud Act 2006, Conspire to steal from another, unauthorized computer access with intent to commit other offences\\". He was used as a public face on television & as a spokesperson for the news to represent LizardSquad.

Development Teruyo Nogami, who was a longtime assistant of Akira Kurosawa, worked as a special adviser on the film, and jointed the director and star for a question and answer session about the film. The film was based on an award-winning novel by Rin Hamuro. Koizumi claimed that he did not want to send any political messages with the film and instead intended to portray the real life events as accurately as possible. Reception The film debuted at number two in the Japanese box office and grossed a total of $8,804,424 in Japan. The Japan Times awarded the film a score of five out of ten, saying that the film failed to invoke the film of Akira Kurosawa that it was influenced by.

Local councils are allowed to increase the local fund. The intention is to shift resources into social care and community services from the NHS budget in England and so save ¬£1 billion a year by keeping patients out of hospital. Each of the 151 health and wellbeing boards is required to produce a local plan, and these plans are checked by NHS England. Analysis of the plans submitted showed that social care would benefit from the fund by about ¬£2 billion. This is four times the amount projected for hospitals to save from reduced activity. The National Audit Office said in November 2014 that the plans had been inadequately thought through and were based on ‚Äúoptimism rather than evidence‚Äù. There was no evidence that showed that integrated care reduces unplanned hospital admissions. Francis Maude praised Inclusion Healthcare at a speech in December 2014 about the Fund saying the company could provide care more cheaply and simply than the NHS. He said the fund was unlikely to lift the pressure from overcrowded hospitals because of ‚Äúendless process and bureaucracy‚Äù in the NHS. He related how Inclusion had helped a homeless man with leg ulcers who was refusing to go into hospital because he could not afford to put his dog in kennels while he was there by writing \\"a cheque for ¬£200 or whatever it cost to have the dog vaccinated and put into kennels\\". According to Maude, the firm say \\"actually if we had still been in the NHS we could never have done that without endless process and bureaucracy and auditing and which budget does it come out of, and how do we account for it, and it would never have happened‚Äù. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and the Healthcare Financial Managers Association surveyed the ambitious plans for saving money through integration financed by the BCF in December 2015 and concluded that 80% were likely to fail and that many were hampering progress, and ‚Äúgiving integration a bad name‚Äù. Targets for reduced hospital admission had generally not been delivered. In February 2017 the National Audit Office produced a report saying that the ¬£5.3 billion spent in 2015/16 had not delivered value for money. Emergency hospital admissions had increased by 87,000 between 2014/15 and 2015/16, rather than the planned reduction of 106,000, which had cost an additional ¬£311 million.

She was the daughter of the Chutia King Dharmadhwajpal also known as Dhirnarayan. Born in Sadiya, she was married to Nityapal or Nitai. In 1524, due to Nityapal's weak leadership, the Ahoms took advantage and attacked the kingdom at its weakest state, they conquered Sadiya and killed Nityapal. So Sadhani who played a prominent role in the fight against the Ahoms was asked to marry Sadiyakhowa Gohain, the Ahom governor of Sadiya. Sadhani preferred death to dishonour, and sacrificed her own life by jumping from the top of Chandragiri hills near Sadiya in 1524. History Queen of Chutia kingdom Sadhani was born in around 1493 A.D. to king Dhirnarayan. She was married at the age of 19 years in the year 1512 A.D. and crowned queen in 1522 A.D. after the aged Chutia king Dhirnarayan won the battle of Mungkhrang fort in 1520 A.D. Being unable to find a suitable groom for Sadhani, a Swayamvara was organised by the king. The king promised to marry Sadhani to any person who would be able to shoot down a running squirrel on the top of a Mori-xali(cemetry) with an arrow. To everyone's surprise, it was a cow-herder named Nitai(from the Chakusara clan) who was able to kill the squirrel. The king kept his promise and married off the princess to Nitai who was since then given the name Nitipal. The king retired to the hills leaving the throne to Nitipal and Sadhani. Nitipal's weak rule Being a cow herder before becoming king, Nitipal was an inefficient king. He didn't have any idea how to rule over a kingdom and it was Sadhani who had to take charge. Nitipal dismissed all the old wise ministers and instead recruited his own friends from his village as his ministers. This resulted in a rebellion within the kingdom by the old ministers which was led by the brother of the former king named Surdhwajpal. But, it was crushed soon. Due to this chaos spread in the kingdom, the Chutia chiefs of other areas like Dhemaji, Lakhimpur and Biswanath became independent. Nitipal was popularly known as A-nitipal because of this inefficiency and recklessness. Sadiya was solitary and had no contact to any of the chutia chiefs of the other parts of the kingdom.Bhuyan, S.K. Deodhai Assam Buranji. D.H.A.S, 1932, p.195-199. After the defeat at Dibrugarh, Nitipal sued for peace. The Ahom king Suhungmung demanded the royal heirloom and queen Sadhani. But, Nitipal disagreed and instead send other gifts.Wade, J.P,An Account of Assam, p. 24 Prior Royal mandate As per the Darrang buranji, one of the Chutia princesses was married to an Ahom prince(probably Suhunmung) in the years before the annexation. This princess helped him get one of the royal Golden Cat idols which were the heirlooms of the Chutia kings. Although it was not the original one, it later gave Suhungmung royal mandate to annex and rule over the Chutia kingdom at a later time. The first day of the attack The Sadiya attack took place in the year 1524 A.D. on the first day(first Wednesday) of Chutia Bisu/Bihu) which was 16 April 1524. This day is reserved for the Bor-bali(grand sacrifice). It is still practiced today in Sadiya. On this day, no other person is allowed to carry weapons besides the Deori priests. The invaders very well knew this fact. At that time, Chutias were the only people in the entire Northeast India who possessed firearms like Hiloi(guns) and Bortop(cannons). So, the invaders very well knew that a frontal attack was never possible. So, they planned a sudden attack on this very day. They attacked when the entire city was busy celebrating Bisu. The siege of Sadiya is referred to as Kosu-kota Ran in the Buranjis which literally translates to Battle of Yam-cutting. This was evidently because there was no resistance provided by armless soldiers and the invaders slaughtered innocent people like chopping vegetables. Last battle at Chandangiri The sudden attack at Sadiya forced the king and queen along with some of the soldiers who survived, to flee to the Chandangiri hills situated above Sadiya. The Chutiyas attacked valiantly against the invaders from the hills. They applied guerrilla warfare strategies and used Faakdhenu(crossbows) and spears. The army killed hundreds of enemies. Queen Sadhani formed a female fighting squad of 120 warriors. They assisted the army by rolling big boulders onto the enemy below. The invaders were unable to do anything. That day was 21 April (7th Bohag) and was widely considered as Ujha (Drummer's) Bisu. Therefore, one of the former ministers of the Chutias whom Nitipal had removed sided with the Ahoms and suggested the Ahom commander Phrasengmung Borgohain to play the Dhol. Thus‚Äå the general ordered some captives to climb up Ghila creepers and play the Bisu drum or Dhol. As it was the season of Bihu, the Chutia army took it to be a sign that reinforcements had arrived and that it was a sign of victory, thinking the Ahoms had been chased out. So, thinking the drum beats to be a signal of victory they came down to the lower hills where the enemy forces were hiding. Another former Chutia commander named Gajraj Borua who had sided with the Ahoms showed the enemy the exact way to the location where the king was hiding.Mahanta, Sukumar. Assam Buranji. D.H.A.S., 1945, p. 10. The king was attacked and killed by an arrow while Sadhani fought until she took her own life by jumping from a hill. Sati Sadhani Divas Every year in Assam, 21 April is celebrated as Sati Sadhani divas to honour the sacrifices made by the Sutiya Queen. The Government of Assam declares this day as state holiday. Sati Sadhani Award The award is instituted by the Sutiya Jati Unnayan Parishad. The award is given to a person every year, having outstanding contributions to the field of art, culture and literature. The person to be honoured by this Award is selected by a committee formed by the Parishad.

In addition to piano accompaniment on the title track by its composer Jim Brickman, this particular holiday release of original recordings (number six for Mathis) is distinguished by duets with guest vocalists Susan Boyle, Natalie Cole, Gloria Estefan, Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Billy Joel, and The Jordanaires. Recording Mathis recalls, \\"My producer, Fred Mollin, and I wanted to do some duets,\\" and the number of singing partners for this one project far exceeded the tally of pairings arranged for any of his previous studio albums. In addition to covering several familiar holiday favorites \\"we decided that we wanted a newer song and we came up with Jim Brickman's [\\"Sending You a Little Christmas\\"]. He'd recorded it before, but it gave the record that finishing touch.\\" Brickman's original recording of the song featured Contemporary Christian singer Kristy Starling and spent a week at number one on Billboard magazine's Adult Contemporary chart after debuting there in December 2003.. The musician enjoyed the time spent collaborating with Mathis. \\"It was surreal, and definitely a ‚Äòpinch me‚Äô moment. I was so honored, and he sounds so beautiful.\\" The fact that Brickman originated the music definitely added to his experience. \\"It wasn‚Äôt something like ‚ÄòSilent Night,‚Äô where you're just performing. It was actually a song that I wrote.\\" Critical reception After the album's release in October 2013 it was generally well-received, with some critics quite enthusiastic in their praise. BREATHEcast's Timothy Yap described the album as \\"the best amongst Mathis' canon of Christmas offerings,\\" and Michael P. Coleman of Sac Cultural Hub wrote that Mathis was \\"serving as host of a wonderful Christmas party that you should think about crashing this season.\\" Joe Szczechowski of Examiner.com was a bit more equivocal in his comments, describing it as a \\"solid\\" collection with Mathis in \\"fine vocal shape\\" but finding it lacking in comparison with his previous Christmas albums in noting that \\"there's nothing on Sending You a Little Christmas that would be considered a landmark recording. Promotion Mathis appeared on the ABC daytime talk show The View on December 9, 2013, to perform \\"Sending You a Little Christmas\\" and was also interviewed during the visit by Whoopi Goldberg, Barbara Walters, and guest co-host Clinton Kelly. He also performed the title song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno the following week, on December 17. Chart performance The album Sending You a Little Christmas peaked at number 13 on Billboard magazine's list of the Top Holiday Albums and number 53 on the Billboard 200 album chart during the 2013 holiday season. It also became Mathis's first entry on the latter of the two since 2002's The Christmas Album, his previous release of new holiday material,. and his highest charting entry there since 1978 when That's What Friends Are For, his duet album with Deniece Williams, reached number 19.. The title track also did well that winter during its run on the magazine's Adult Contemporary chart, where its number four showing was also the highest that he'd had there since 1978 when he and Williams took \\"Too Much, Too Little, Too Late\\" to number one.. Grammy nomination On December 5, 2014, the album Sending You a Little Christmas was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album and became Mathis's fourth release to be recognized in this category. His previous nods were for 1990's In a Sentimental Mood: Mathis Sings Ellington, 2005's Isn't It Romantic: The Standards Album, and 2010's Let It Be Me: Mathis in Nashville.

Previously used as de facto public land, in 2014 the island was purchased by Cards Against Humanity LLC as part of a fundraiser for the Sunlight Foundation. After licensing the island for use by those who contributed to the campaign, the nearby town of Liberty, Maine threatened the games company with hundreds-of-millions in fines for code violations. Pre-2014 Prior to Cards Against Humanity's 2014 purchase, the Bedke/Fox Family Trust owned Birch Island and allowed it to be used by the public. Since the early 1980s, locals had used the location to picnic, swim, camp, and vacation. 2014 purchase In 2012, Cards Against Humanity LLC (CAH) fundraised for the Wikimedia Foundation. In the company's announcement of this, they joked that the company could have bought a private island instead (Little Monkey Caye in the Monkey River, Belize). For their 2014 fundraiser, the company brainstormed what gifts could be sent via first-class mail, weigh less than , measure within , and be \\"really flexible.\\" Remembering their 2012 joke, CAH liaised with the CBRE Group to buy a private island. Inspired to conserve some small piece of wilderness, raise money for charity, and \\"make people laugh\\", CAH bought Birch Island from the Bedke/Fox Family Trust on October 31, 2014 for . The island, located near Liberty, Maine in St. George Lake (within sight of Maine State Route 3), was renamed Hawaii 2 because \\"it's the Maine island\\". Though Google Maps updated the name upon seeing the deed, CAH forwent filing with the United States Board on Geographic Names because of the time involved and geographic name changes must benefit the community, by honoring a local hero or something.\\" Controversy That year CAH organized a fundraiser called \\"Ten Days or Whatever of Kwanzaa\\" wherein participants contributed to receive ten \\"mystery gifts\\"; $1 of the donation was given to the Sunlight Foundation. The tenth gift, sent to approximately 250,000 people, were certificates entitling the bearer to of Hawaii 2: \\"You may name your square foot of land. You may use the entire private island for passive, non- commercial, non-motorized recreational activities [‚Ä¶] You may tell people at parties that you own part of a private island.\\" The island's official website clarifies that certificate-holders do not actually own any of Hawaii 2 (Hawaii 2, LLC being the sole owner), but that they \\"have rights to use it as a license holder.\\" In February 2015, CAH explained that though they initially wanted to deed one-square-foot parcels to their contributors, too many factors stood in the way of this (e.g. their mailing budget, rights of way, legal liability for the landowners, the nearby town of Liberty being owed taxes on 250,000 parcels, of paperwork needed, and the rights of landowners to develop their plot against the conservationist wishes of CAH). According to Liberty's code-enforcement office, the town considers the certificate licenses to have been sold, and that \\"the island 'continues to be advertised and marketed. Liberty official Donald Harriman told the Bangor Daily News (BDN) that some license-holders had trespassed in order to reach Hawaii 2, though he didn't know whether the Waldo County sheriff's office was involved. In spring 2015, the code-enforcement office wrote to CAH \\"and gave them until April 15 to cease all commercial activity on the island, revoke the 250,000 'licenses' that grant the exclusive use of 1 square foot of land and remove the shed and platform from its present location.\\" Harriman claimed that, failing this, CAH could face fines of $625million per day (equivalent to about $M in ). Harriman also accused CAH of \\"unpermitted commercial use [‚Ä¶] on , in violation of the Liberty Shoreland Ordinance, [‚Ä¶] The entire scheme appears to be a development and/or divisions of land for profit with the possibility of intense use at various times.\\" CAH had not responded to the town by April 10, though two months before Liberty's letter CAH had posted on tumblr saying that not only had they purchased Hawaii 2 for conservation, but the company also \\"joined the local Liberty Lake Association, and we‚Äôll work with them to deal with any issues as they come up.\\" By April 2015, CAH's empty safe‚Äîpreviously containing \\"sloth cards\\" and a bottle of Scotch whisky for visitors‚Äîhad been removed from Hawaii 2, and the company had updated their rules for the island to include allowable hours and prohibitions against leaving or removing anything. By that August, the BDN reported that despite locals' fears, Waldo County, Liberty, and Hawaii 2 had not been overrun, and \\"[t]he island remained peaceful and free of litter\\".

The battle holds an important place in North Korean narratives of history.  Battle  Report of the battle in The Dong-a Ilbo. The battle was reported in numerous newspapers across the world. According to the Korean Friendship Association, the battle was in retaliation to the brutality of the Japanese occupation of Korea at a time when \\"the Japanese imperialists perpetrated unheard-of fascist tyranny against the Korean people\\". According to the official North Korean version of the events, a small unit of about 150‚Äì200 guerrillas of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army's Sixth Division under Kim Il-sung crossed the Amnok River and arrived at the Konjang Hill on 3 June 1937. At 22:00, Kim Il-sung fired a shot into the sky, and the battle started. During the battle, the Japanese-occupied police station, post office, foresters' office, local elementary school, fire department hall were destroyed by the guerrillas. Kim took 4,000 yen from local people and inflicted damage estimated at 16,000 yen. He took the town but only occupied it for a few hours or a day before retreating to Manchuria. Following combat, Kim Il-sung made a speech, where he noted that the Korean people \\"turn out as one in the sacred anti-Japanese war\\". The battle is featured in Kim Il-sung's autobiography With the Century. In it, too, Kim describes his guerrilla troops acting spontaneously and motivated by emotion rather than reason and strategic insights. In it, he said of the event: This official version of the battle does not correspond with some contemporary records such as a Japanese newspaper, however, which suggest that the rebels were actually led by Choe Hyon.  Aftermath and legacy  The news of the battle was reported in numerous newspapers across the world, including the Soviet Union, China, Japan and France. According to the Association for the Study of Songun Politics UK a pro-North Korean, Juche study group: The event brought Kim some fame among both his comrades as well as the Japanese. As result, his influence grew, though the Japanese Imperial Army also started to hunt him, and almost wiped out his force. He was eventually forced retreat into the Soviet Union in 1940. Northern Korea was officially liberated from Japan on V-J Day (). Kim subsequently returned to his home country, and when he managed to establish himself with Soviet help as head of North Korea, his reputation as hero of Pochonbo helped him to gain acceptance and support among the people. Since then, the North Korean government has continuously reinforced the importance of the Battle of Pochonbo and Kim Il-sung's role in it. As result, it was speculated that Kim Jong-un, Kim Il-sung's grandson, had purged Choe Hyon's son Choe Ryong-hae in 2014 to prevent the undermining of the official version of the battle. It later became clear, however, that Choe Ryong-hae had not been purged at all and remained an influential member of the North Korean government. The Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble takes its name from the battle.  Battle site  The battle site is situated at Pochon County, Ryanggang Province at the Kusi Barrage on Kojang Hill.

It was designed by Frank Cullen, Hennessy, Hennessy, Keesing & Co, & J P Donoghue and built from 1927 to 1968. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2008.  History  The Villa Maria Centre is a large complex occupying most of the block bounded by Gotha Street, St Paul's Terrace, Warren Street and Barry Parade. Villa Maria was established by the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, a religious order which has cared for the poor, aged and needy in Queensland since 1874. The Villa Maria Hostel, the subject of this assessment, comprises about two-thirds of the Villa Maria Centre as it stands today. It incorporates the original convent and chapel, and was constructed in stages between 1927 and 1968. Catholic priest, scientist and author Father Julian Tenison Woods, co-founder with Mother Mary MacKillop of the Sisters of St Joseph, established a foundation of Perpetual Adoration in Brisbane in the early 1870s and formed the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration in 1874. A primary objective of the order is the practice of perpetual adoration - there is always one of their number in prayer. Led by Catherine Gaffney (Mother Stanislaus) the first Mother Superior, the first Sisters of Perpetual Adoration (a group of six) rented a house in South Brisbane. They lived extremely frugally, supporting themselves doing needlework, and assisted the poor and needy around them. In 1881 the Sisters moved to Spring Hill where, in 1900, they purchased two cottages in Leichhardt Street (now St Paul's Terrace) at the corner of Warren Street, now part of the current site of the Villa Maria Centre. They became known in Spring Hill as the Black Sisters because they wore long black dresses and bonnets. Though needlework continued to be their main source of income (they were well known for making priests' vestments and supplying Brisbane emporiums with bridal trousseaus), the Sisters were unable to support themselves solely from needlework and began taking in boarders who paid a weekly rental for the rooms. In 1902 they began caring for elderly ladies. Further houses were acquired and the land used for vegetables, flowers, fowls and a cow. In 1912 the Sisters began making altar breads for the archdiocese of Brisbane. The largest period of growth for the Institute of Perpetual Adoration took place under the guidance of Archbishop James Duhig. Upon succeeding to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane in 1917, one of Duhig's earliest works was to give formal approval to the work of the Sisters. In 1920, Archbishop James Duhig gave diocesan approbation to the Institute and granted the Sisters their distinctive dress of a black habit and black scapular covered with a white mantle. Up to that time, the Sisters had had no legal security as a religious institute and had worn no strictly religious dress. James Duhig, Archbishop of Brisbane, took a great interest in the work of the Sisters and encouraged them to build a new facility on their Spring Hill (now Fortitude Valley) site. Villa Maria was also part of Duhig's larger urban design and town planning initiatives, which included the grand scheme for the Holy Name Cathedral. He saw Villa Maria as an integral component of a vision of Brisbane as a city of grand buildings and boulevards, with Leichhardt Street (now St Paul's Terrace) as a tree lined boulevard with tall government buildings and stately mansions on one side and to the other, Victoria Park, plunging into a valley and climbing to the Herston slopes which was to be a future University of Queensland site. The design of the new building - a convent and hostel - was given to Hennessy, Hennessy, Keesing and Co. and J.P. Donoghue, a Sydney firm of architects (after 1926 known as Hennessy and Hennessy). The firm was commissioned by the archdiocese to design several churches, schools, convents, monasteries, hospitals and charitable institutions. Its work culminated in the proposed scheme for the Holy Name Cathedral. Amongst the other ecclesiastical buildings they designed were St Joseph's Dalby (1921), St Agatha's Clayfield (1925), St Augustine's Coolangatta (1926) and St Ignatius Toowong (1930). The convent and hostel of Villa Maria was built in four stages - 1927-1928, 1940, 1965 and 1968. On 6 December 1925 Duhig laid the foundation stone of the first stage of the building, comprising the hostel and chapel. The chapel opened in 1927 and the hostel in 1928. By 1938, the Sisters were ready to build the next stage of the complex and commissioned Brisbane architects, Cullen and Egan, to complete the project. Cullen was a former articled pupil and draftsman at Hennessy, Hennessy and Co. and nephew of Archbishop Duhig. Cullen and Egan prepared the working drawings and supervised the construction of the later stages continuing the original concept of the Hennessy scheme with the same architectural form, expression and detailing with some variation in the internal planning. In 1940 the second section of Villa Maria, the convent wing which included facilities for bread making, ironing and laundry work, was completed. A lift tower was incorporated into the 1928 portion of the building adjacent to the main entrance on Warren Street at the junction of these two stages of the building. In the following year, the basement of the new convent building was converted into dormitories for country girls. It was not until the early 1960s that plans were prepared to complete the building. In 1963 further cottages were demolished to make way for a new wing along St Paul's Terrace. On 17 July 1965 Archbishop Patrick Mary O'Donnell opened this wing, which provided additional accommodation for 38 women. Built by MJ O'Leary and designed by the architects Frank L Cullen, Fagg, Hargreaves and Mooney, the building cost more than ¬£100,000. The wing was named the St Stanislaus wing in honour of Catherine Gaffney (Mother Stanislaus) the first Mother Superior of the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration. In 1968 the final stage, St Gabriel's Wing, was constructed. Honouring Mother Mary Gabriel Maloney, Mother-General from 1955-1967, the wing ran from Warren Street to Gotha Street along the southeast of the site. Opened on 7 April 1968 by Archbishop O'Donnell, the new wing was designed by architects Frank L Cullen, Fagg, Hargraves and Moony and built by J O'Leary. It provided 48 bedrooms for aged ladies, 22 private rooms for the Sisters, a spacious reception lounge and laundry. With the completion of St Gabriel's Wing, the capacity of the hostel was increased to 134. In the 1990s further buildings were constructed to the southeast to provide additional care facilities, a new chapel and convent. This part of the complex links with the earlier hostel and chapel by a covered link at ground floor level. In 2008, the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration continue to care for elderly women and the Villa Maria complex remains the centre of their work in Brisbane. The early convent/hostel building has changed little in external form and expression, however external openings have been glazed with the enclosure of the verandahs. The interior of the building has been extensively altered in the first decade of the 21st century to accommodate contemporary expectations for hostel and aged care facilities. The planning remains largely as designed in the 1920s with double loaded corridors internally accommodating rooms for residents opening onto verandahs and the provision of communal living and workings spaces. The building now accommodates only the hostel/aged care facilities and the convent is housed within the adjacent later buildings. The chapel continues to be used for worship by the residents but not as the chapel for perpetual adoration.  Description  Courtyard, 2008 The heritage listing only includes the E-shaped building constructed between 1927 and 1968 and bounded by Gotha Street, St Paul's Terrace and Warren Street. The later buildings to the southeast of the Villa Maria Centre site are not part of the heritage listing. Boldly occupying most of the sloping city block bounded by Gotha Street, St Paul's Terrace and Warren Street, Villa Maria convent and hostel dominates the streetscape of St Paul's Terrace, Fortitude Valley. Major alterations to the fabric of the interior have been made to accommodate contemporary expectations for hostel and aged care facilities. The building has changed little in external form and expression, although many of the external openings have been glazed with the enclosure of the verandahs. The three-, four- and five-storeyed, polychromatic facebrick building designed in a Romanesque idiom, has its principal elevations to St Paul's Terrace and Warren Street. The E-shape building is sheltered by terracotta tiled roofs and Celtic crosses crown all the gable parapets. The massive quality of the exterior is relieved by a regular rhythm of round and flat arches to the verandah openings and characterised by bands of geometric patterning, light coloured brickwork to sills and arches, decorative arcading and scalloped corbelling. The corners of the building are defined by towers with gabled parapets and the north-west and south-east wings are punctuated by narrow central towers incorporating minor entrances. These entrances are defined by short white-painted columns with decorative composite capitals supporting an embellished semi-circular arch. The tower facades are enlivened with decorative arcades to the upper levels. The former main entrance to the complex is to the centre of the Warren Street frontage which is asymmetrical around a wider central tower than that of the other elevations. This entrance is approached by a set of brick stairs from street level and is sheltered by a projecting, white-painted concrete porch with a vaulted ceiling and a gable roof surmounted by a Celtic cross and supported by four columns with decorative composite capitals. A narrow, square tower rises adjacent to the south-east and is distinguished by the geometric patterning and decorative corbelling characteristic of the building. The entrance to the complex is now in the middle of the southern section of the Warren Street wing. The ends of the north-west and south-east corner towers and the exterior of the chapel are visible from Gotha Street. The chapel is a three-storey volume characterised by a blind, semi-circular apse and tall narrow arched window openings between flat buttresses to the sides. The fine polychromatic brickwork includes light brick banding defining the arches and bases of the long windows and eaves decorated with corbelling in a machicolation motif. The earlier stages of the building (Warren Street wing and half the St Paul's Terrace wing) have internal load bearing masonry walls with timber and reinforced concrete floors and the later 1960s wings are of concrete column and beam construction with concrete slabs. The plan is arranged as a cloister treatment around central courtyards with external verandahs and colonnades, the chapel dividing the cloister into two. The planning remains largely as designed in the 1920s - with double loaded corridors internally accommodating rooms for residents opening onto verandahs and provision of communal living and working spaces in various parts of the building. The south-east wing and the south half of the Warren Street wing have been refurbished and now accommodate ensuited bedrooms off double loaded corridors. Most original wall, ceiling and floor finishes have been lost, bedrooms enlarged and ensuites added. The special purpose rooms (including the bakery) in the former convent area are replaced with other room configurations. Some of the communal dining/living spaces remain. Verandahs are enclosed or subsumed and most of the verandah openings are now glazed. Verandahs to the south-east wing have been subsumed by the larger bedrooms but retain unglazed verandah openings. Verandahs to Warren Street are subdivided into rooms. At the time of inspection (June 2008), the other wings were being dismantled in preparation for a similar refurbishment. The former main entrance opens onto an inner porch and then into the vestibule to the chapel. These areas are notable for the fine timber panelled doors surmounted by semi-circular lights or painted tympanum murals, decorative architraves and coloured glass windows matching those in the chapel. Some silky oak and other joinery survives throughout the building including cupboards, windows and doors. South of the chapel, the handsome terrazzo stair with elegant turned timber posts and austere decorative iron balustrading remains.  Chapel  A splendid three-storey rectangular volume with a towering vaulted ceiling, the chapel has a projecting apse to the east, a mezzanine gallery to the west and holds a congregation of over 350 persons. Lit to each side by five, tall, narrow, coloured glass windows with decorative geometric grids featuring crosses and arcade motifs, the interior is finished in white painted plaster with ribs, compound columns and decorative features picked out in gold. Latticed ceiling roses vent the space. The sanctuary is within the projecting apse, lit by a small narrow light to each side and encircled by a blind arcade. It accommodates the original decorated marble reredos and altar with flanking angels on marble plinths on the rear elevated platform and a plainer freestanding marble altar to the lower front platform. The chapel houses a number of statues including those of the Sacred Heart, Our Lady, St Patrick, St Joseph, St Theresa and St Francis. A fine set of painted stations of the cross in carved timber frames hang on the walls. The sanctuary floor is carpeted (the original mosaic marble finish may survive under) and floors to the nave are parquetry. The gallery has a decorative timber panelled front of silky oak and is supported by handsome columns with a marble treatment. Side doors open onto the colonnades of the flanking cloisters. The colonnade to the southeast is now enclosed and overlooks the courtyard a level below. The roof of the chapel colonnade to northeast is supported by white-painted concrete columns with cushion capitals and forms part of the encircling colonnade to the courtyard.  Courtyards  The north courtyard is an open space with some moveable tables, chairs and umbrellas. The south courtyard accommodates recent raised garden beds and a shade structure. A number of recent extensions and a freestanding rectangular building, none of which are considered to be of cultural heritage significance, intrude into the courtyard space and along the northeast side of the chapel.  Lift and lift tower  The external form of the lift tower to Warren Street survives and accommodates a modern lift.  Fence and entrance gates  A perimeter fence around the three street frontages comprises brick piers punctuating brick infill panels with decorative centres in a geometric pattern. A handsome white-painted concrete gateway embellished to match the front entrance porch houses a decorative solid metal double gate opening to the corner of St Paul's Terrace and Warren Street. A similar gate constructed to match this earliest gate also stands to the other St Paul's Terrace corner.  Views  The complex affords sweeping views across the CBD of Brisbane, Fortitude Valley and over to the Story Bridge.  Heritage listing  Villa Maria Hostel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Opened in 1928, Villa Maria is significant as the first permanent home of the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration in Queensland and has remained a focal point for their activities until the present day. Villa Maria provides evidence of the development of the order in Queensland and the religious and social practices they implemented. Villa Maria is significant for its association with the social welfare program of the Catholic Church in the establishment of hostels and hospices, particularly for women. Villa Maria is important as evidence for the period of expansion of the Catholic Church in Queensland during the 1920s and 1930s under the leadership of Archbishop James Duhig. Known for his particular interest in urban design and town planning, Villa Maria is an important component of Duhig's vision for Brisbane as a city of boulevards and fine buildings. The establishment of the convent and hostel reflects the active interest of Archbishop Duhig in the work of the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration and his confident building program which saw the establishment of many of the Catholic church's prominent buildings including Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola at Toowong, Corpus Christi Church at Nundah, part of All Hallows' School (All Hallows' School) and Nazareth House (Nazareth House). The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Villa Maria is significant for its considerable architectural merit, particularly the well-composed exterior and chapel, and is a fine example of the work of Hennessy & Hennessy, Keesing and Co and J.P. Donoghue, prominent architects in Brisbane and Sydney who undertook many projects for the Catholic church during Archbishop Duhig's time. With is picturesque massing and finely crafted polychromatic brickwork, distinctive round arches, arcading, prominent tower, restrained ornamentation, geometric patterning in the brickwork and use of corbelling in a machicolation motif, Villa Maria is a fine example of a building in the Romanesque idiom, a style commonly employed in the design of religious places during the inter-war period. The principal architectural component of the Villa Maria complex, the chapel, incorporates defining elements of the Romanesque most notably masonry construction, round arched windows, patterned brickwork, brick detailing including the machicolation motif; and within a towering vaulted ceiling, restrained embellishment and narrow coloured glass windows. It comprises the essential elements of a typical 20th century Catholic church including a collection of religious furniture and icons, in particular altars, statues and stations of the cross. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. A prominent landmark on the elevated ridge of St Paul's Terrace, Spring Hill and visible from many parts of the immediate neighbourhoods of Fortitude Valley and the Brisbane CBD, Villa Maria is distinguished by its distinctive picturesque massing and fine polychromatic brickwork. It is distinguished by restrained embellishment including geometric patterning in the brickwork, decorative entrance porches and decorative corbelling. Surviving original fine joinery and finishes, particularly within the main entrance porch, chapel vestibule and chapel including fine timber panelled doors, glazed fanlights, coloured glass windows with cross and arcade motifs, painted decorative murals are a delight. The chapel provides a contemplative haven with its towering vaulted ceiling, narrow coloured glass windows and fine quality furniture and finishes including polished timber pews, parquetry flooring, timber panelling to the galley and handsome marble treated columns. Villa Maria is notable for the expansive views it affords across Brisbane CBD, Spring Hill and Fortitude Valley. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Villa Maria is important for its association with the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, who have maintained a presence on this site since 1900. The place has been associated with the work of the Sisters in caring for the aged and infirm for over 70 years, and for a time, in offering accommodation for young women working in Brisbane.

He was responsible for acquiring large amounts of private property for use as national and state parks, and played a key role in establishing Voyageurs National Park, Fort Snelling State Park, and Charles A. Lindbergh State Park.  Early life  U.W. Hella was the second of three children and born in Cloquet, Minnesota. His parents had immigrated from Finland and settled there with his father taking employment in a local paper mill. He attended elementary and high school in Cloquet (where he earned the nickname \\"Judge\\") and received a degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Minnesota.His older brother, Roy, received his degree at the University of Minnesota in Chemical Engineering and returned to Cloquet, eventually becoming general manager of the local mill. His younger sister, Rachel, died at the age of 12 from rheumatic fever.  Early career  After receiving his degree in 1931, Hella searched for work and was initially hired by the Minnesota Highway Department for a year before being laid off. He considered working in the mill but was offered a job with the National Park Services as Civil Engineer Foreman as part of the Civilian Conservation Corps program.  Minnesota State Parks  In 1937, the same year he was married to Viola (Vi) Arntson, he was transferred back to the State of Minnesota Parks system from the Omaha office of the National Park Service. He initially supervised the preparation of the Minnesota Park, Parkway and Recreational Plan. Between the time he spent in the Civilian Conservation Corps, the National Park Service, and work on the \\"Recreational Plan\\" he gained experience in managing parks and developed working relationships with the National Park Service. He was named director of Minnesota State Parks in 1953 and served in that capacity until 1973. One of his first initiatives was to form the Minnesota Council of State Parks with Minnesota Supreme Court justice Clarence R. Magney. During those years he earned the reputation as a respected state official and was certainly the most knowledgeable person on parks and recreational resources in the state. His opinion on such matters was highly regarded by legislators, NPS officials and prominent conservationists.  Projects of note   Minnesota Council of State Parks  In 1954, shortly after becoming director, Hella worked with Judge Magney to form the council with the purpose of acquiring and protecting land for the state park system. Initially limited to 16 members, the council has since been renamed to the Minnesota Parks & Trails Council, has over 3,400 members, and has helped the park system grow from 88,000 acres to over 160,000 acres.  Voyageurs National Park  There had been ongoing efforts from as early as 1891 to create a national park in northern Minnesota. The efforts finally gained momentum with the creation of the Voyageurs National Park Association in 1965 which was founded by Hella as well as Sigurd Olson, and Governor Elmer L. Andersen. Later the group, working with the Minnesota Council of State Parks, helped organize citizen groups and associations to support the campaign. Congressional authorization of the park occurred in December 1970 and was signed by the president in January 1971, two years before Hella's retirement.  Fort Snelling State Park  Fort Snelling was original built at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. In 1960 A. R. Nichols proposed a 2,400 acre park which gained the attention of Thomas C. Savage. Savage contacted Hella, who advised him to organize a citizen association dedicated to creation of the park. In 1961, the federal government, acting under the 1944 Surplus Property Act, deeded 320 acres to the state as a historic monument and the park was formed. Since then there have been continuous donations of funds and property helping the park to expand.

It was adopted by Parliament on 17 July 2009 and came into force on 1 October 2011. It replaced the Civil Code of 1865 as well as the Commercial Code of 1887 and the Family Code of 1954. Background The Civil Code was drafted together with new penal and procedural codes as part of a major effort to reform Romania's legal system after the country's accession to the European Union. An impact study contracted by the Ministry of Justice concluded that the Civil Code was the least difficult to implement of the four new codes, but nevertheless the process was criticized by parts of the Romanian judiciary and civil society for lacking adequate preparatory measures to ensure a smooth transition. The code was adopted in 2009 after extensive parliamentary debate, published in an amended version in the Official Gazette on 15 July 2011, and came into force on 1 October 2011 via the adoption of Law no. 71/2011 on the implementation of the Civil Code. Contents The code is divided into a preliminary title and seven books (cƒÉr≈£i), which contain provisions on persons, family, property, successions, obligations, prescription and private international law. The code was developed in line with the monist principle of concentrating private law regulations into a single code, including commercial regulations, and was inspired primarily by the Civil Code of Quebec.

Certain health care professionals and experts in certain languages relevant to the US military (e.g. Pashto and Farsi, due to the War in Afghanistan) meet eligibility requirements for recruitment through this program. Soldiers belonging to the enlisted rank, and recruited through this program, become citizens of the United States, usually at the end of their Basic Combat Training (BCT). History MAVNI was spearheaded by immigration attorney Margaret Stock, a former U.S. Army Reserve officer and West Point professor. The program started in 2008 under the George W. Bush administration as a one- year pilot program with a cap of 1000 recruits. The program was suspended following the 2009 Fort Hood shooting and a revision of Army vetting procedures, before being resumed in 2012 with the new vetting procedure. In October 2014, people belonging to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) category became possibly eligible for the MAVNI program. In December 2014, the program has been extended until 2016 with a raised cap of 5000 recruits. Enlistments are permitted for both active-duty and reserve assignments, but not in the National Guard. As of December 2016, MAVNI is under review and closed indefinitely to new recruits, as the Trump administration was unenthusiastic. Several lawsuits happened due to the Defense Department allegedly attempting to pressure out existing MAVNI service members, including outright discharging 40 members in July 2018 for failing new background checks. These new background checks were criticized as being shoddy and relying on trivial information such as a MAVNI member having parents living in a foreign country as a reason to reject the check due to \\"foreign ties\\". The softer methods included an \\"administrative discharge\\" of simply not sending soldiers to required training or giving them new contracts. This process of discharging MAVNI members itself was suspended on July 20, 2018, one month later. A related legal dispute ended in February 2019 with U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly of the Western District of Washington ordering the Defense Department to stop unequal treatment of soldiers in the program, such as by forcing them to submit to \\"continuous monitoring\\" background checks without any case-by-case reason, when other soldiers are not subject to similar restrictions. MAVNI's sudden suspension left over 4,000 immigrant recruits in limbo. As of 2020, many of the MAVNI recruits are still waiting in limbo.  Impact  The MAVNI program has several notable recruiting successes; for example, the program enlisted Saral Shrestha, the U.S. Army Soldier of the Year for 2012, and Augustus Maiyo, the winner of the 2012 Marine Corps Marathon. It also enlisted world class athletes like Paul Chelimo, the 2016 Olympic silver medalist at 5000 meters and many others. MAVNI recruits of the Army have a lower attrition rate than other recruits, and many hold higher educational credentials than other enlistees. Around 30% of MAVNI recruits were assigned to Special Operations units due to their language abilities, which facilitate operations in territories with few English speakers. Several MAVNI recruits have written about their experiences in the program. With the suspension of MAVNI, the US Defense Department has weakened its requirements on would-be native citizens in an attempt to fill up missing headcount, such as allowing more waivers for people with criminal backgrounds or histories of illegal drug use to join the military.

Early adulthood When he had attained almost the equivalent of high school training, he joined the Police Force as a recruit, where he was appointed to the position of office orderly. Six months later, he became a policeman in Port Antonio, Jamaica, and then was promoted to a desk job as process clerk. Within three years, his eyesight became impairedfurther memoir reference and it was necessary for him to wear glasses, which police officers were not allowed to do, so he was honorably discharged from the Police Force. Thereafter, he was appointed to a responsible and lucrative position as clerk of Port Antonio‚Äôs government market.another quote from the memoir First leadership positions While he was a police officer in Port Antonio, he joined a Baptist church, was baptized, and became a full member of the church, where he was elected Superintendent of the Sunday School and President of the Christian Endeavor Society. He was elected vice president of an organizing committee that founded the YMCA of Port Antonio, Jamaica, during which period he made his first public address and first accepted his to become a minister and preach Christian gospel. Rev. Carnegie goes to Canada In 1915, Carnegie left Jamaica for Canada, heading to the United States to study divinity. In Canada, he sought to work his way through divinity school, but he was surprised at the prejudice, color-aroused antagonism and discrimination that he encountered in the Toronto labor market. In spite of references from the YMCA and Jamaican Government, he could find no other than menial labor to do, picking apples, although he had served as a police officer and public administrator. After six months pressing apples in a factory, he found a position as a sleeping car porter with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. He was not able to earn sufficient monies to study, but with a gift from a benefactor, he enrolled in a primarily African-American school, Virginia Union University. Carnegie imprisoned for refusing to serve in Canadian army In 1917, Carnegie was ordered drafted into the Canadian Army, but as a Christian minister he was ‚Äúhostile to the spirit of war‚Äù. For refusing to serve, he was court-martialed and sent to a prison camp where he was made to do hard labor. There, he evangelized his fellow prisoners. Color-aroused discrimination in the United States He arrived in a United States South that was deeply divided along racial lines by Jim Crow segregation, where other Blacks warned him to step off the sidewalks if he saw whites coming along. However, not having grown up with segregation in his native Jamaica, Carnegie nonetheless felt uninhibited going among whites with confidence and assurance. Marriage and children Once in the United States, he married Susan Blake, also from Jamaica, and they had six children, one of whom died at birth. Christian organizing Mr. Carnegie spoke and delivered sermons at various churches and civic gatherings in Virginia, West Virginia and South Carolina. He visited jails and slums, bringing the Christian gospel to prisoners and the poor. He became pastor of the Carmel Methodist Church. In assessing his new surroundings, he observed that Blacks‚Äô schools were severely dilapidated or nonexistent, while many Blacks lived on whites‚Äô property in mud huts. In response, Rev. Carnegie founded the first high school in Smyth County, Virginia for African American students, which was named after him: the Carnegie High School. It was the only Black high school in a hundred-mile area. Alumni of the school remember Carnegie‚Äôs leadership with fondness and admiration. Building the first schools Two decades later, this first local Black public high school, built by Black men donating their labor, was closed in a consolidation with white public schools, with the goal desegregation. After the school was closed, the building housed the local Head Start program. Rev. Carnegie was involved in dozens of projects, many financed by the Rosenwald Fund, to fund and build schools for Blacks in the American South of the Jim Crow era. Religious formation For lack of financial support, Carnegie struggled for several years to finish college, but he raised money by preaching at churches in the United States and Canada, and received many donations. He attended the Chatham Collegiate in Chatham, Ontario for a year while serving as pastor of a nearby church. College graduation When he graduated from Lincoln University, he won the college's singular $50.00 Nassau Prize upon graduation in 1923. The same college journal that announced the award carried an article addressing social currents in Black America that would come to guide Carnegie's career in the ministry. Living condition, including abysmal housing and miserable or nonexistent education in the American Jim Crow South, were leading Blacks to engage in a great migration northward literally by the millions. Carnegie received religious formation at a college that underscored, \\"The example of Lincoln Alumni, who are prominent leaders of their race in all parts of the country and in various lines of activity, holds out before the undergraduate high ideals of achievement and of usefulness in service.\\" Carnegie campaigns for black schools and hospitals Returning to the United States, Rev. Carnegie traveled widely, from Florida to New England, speaking to audiences composed of civil leaders, business leaders, landowners and politicians and convinced southern whites to support the founding of schools for Blacks. Among other arguments, he appealed to whites‚Äô self-interest, arguing that the mass migration of Blacks to the North was driven by poverty and lack of education. Proposing to build schools and hospitals for Blacks was inherently controversial in a states where it had recently been illegal to assemble Blacks for the purpose of teaching them to read. He argued that whites needed Black labor but would have to provide Blacks with education in order to dissuade them from leaving for the North, where more opportunity was available. Carnegie enlisted whites in the Black schools effort even when, as a matter of principal, they did not believe in educating Blacks at all. Carnegie, however, saw the construction of as many schools as possible as a way of preparing unlettered Blacks to read the Bible and, therefore, as a natural outgrowth of his itinerant Christian ministry. Carnegie finds funds for building black schools With monies from the Rosenwald Fund, he built several Rosenwald schools. ‚ÄúA Rosenwald School was the name informally applied to over five thousand schools, shops, and teachers' homes in the United States which were built primarily for the education of African-Americans in the early 20th century . . . Julius Rosenwald, an American clothier who became part-owner and president of Sears, Roebuck and Company, was the founder of The Rosenwald Fund, through which he contributed seed money for many of the schools and other philanthropic causes. To promote collaboration between white and black citizens, Rosenwald required communities to commit public funds to the schools, as well as to contribute additional cash donations.‚Äù Rev. Carnegie was one of many leaders in African- American rural communities across the South who raised millions of dollars to fund better education for their children. His talent included locating and winning state funds available for the construction of schools for Blacks and contributions from wealthy individuals, white and black. While raising money for others, he was often broke himself, investing his money in his school and hospital projects and eating cheese and crackers for lunch rather than accept gifts from parishioners, lest they suspect he was working for his own benefit rather than for theirs. Meanwhile, he traveled throughout the eastern United States preaching and seeking funding for his schools. Carnegie beaten for refusing to sit at back of Greyhound bus Carnegie was unafraid to travel about advocating for Blacks even when he was informed that whites were unhappy with his efforts, but he was not immune to the violence that surrounded him. \\"In the United States, too, Jamaicans like the Rev. Amos Carnegie had suffered from the vicious hatred of southern racists who beat him because he refused to take a back seat on a bus travelling through Georgia one night. And there were many others like him.\\" The 1950s incident and the Reverend's legal action were reported widely in the United States by wire services and in the large Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, as well. A photograph of him bleeding after the beating can be found in the archives of National Historic Images. Carnegie attracts national Attention to segregation of buses The New York Times also reported the Jim Crow beating of Mr. Carnegie for his refusal to sit in the back of a bus. The National Black Jet magazine reported that Carnegie sued Greyhound Bus for $100,000 after the color-aroused beating. Carnegie conceives plan to build hospitals for blacks in segregated states Hospitals, like schools, were segregated in the United States, with Black hospitals nonexistent and white ones refusing to see or treat Blacks. Seeing a generalized need for hospitals for Blacks, Rev. Carnegie conceived a plan for Blacks to build hospitals staffed by Black doctors, through the National Hospital Foundation, particularly in cities with Black populations of at least 10,000. But, his efforts were often met with criticism and controversy. Controversy In 1937, the journal of the National Medical Association published a discussion of Rev. Carnegie‚Äôs hospital movement, reporting that he was endeavoring to raise a penny from each African American in the USA, but alleging that he had appropriated the name of the Association without authorization in discussions with the New York Times and rejecting the Reverend‚Äôs attempts to attain the support of the Association. In the article, the Association rebuked and rebuffed the Reverend, ridiculing his belief that he could collect money from all African Americans nationwide and calling his proposals \\"dreams\\". However, as Vanessa Northington Gamble demonstrates in the historical text Making a Place for Ourselves: The Black Hospital Movement 1920-1945, because whites denied Blacks access to the hospitals where whites were treated, the question of whether and how to begin to provide hospital care to Blacks was inherently political and controversial. Rev. Carnegie's voice was influential in the debate; his article entitled, But Integration is Empty Talk was widely cited and debated at the time. The book, The History of Healthcare in Lynchburg, published in Virginia alleges in a section entitled, \\"And One Villain: The Rev. Amos Carnegie\\", that in early December, 1935, the Rev. Amos Carnegie appeared in Lynchburg, collected money from local Blacks with a promise to build a hospital staffed by Black doctors, and then disappeared with the money and without such a hospital being built. However, the locally produced and self-published book includes no sources or citations whatever for the potentially baseless accusation. The mere accusation highlights the difficulty the Reverend faced engaging in fundraising and earning the trust of color aroused Black and white populations. In one fundraising campaign, he proposed that money would be raised among Blacks to be held in trust by white trustees. Rev. Carnegie arrested He was arrested in Birmingham, AL and convicted of soliciting monies without a license, given a suspended sentence of a year in jail and fined $50.00. When he traveled, he continued to face segregated churches, transportation, hotels, restaurants and other facilities. His children attended segregated schools and rarely saw whites at all, said his daughter in her autobiography. Rev. Carnegie's projects capture the nation's imagination In 1951, the Journal of Medical Education reported that Rev. Carnegie's National Hospital Foundation and Howard University jointly proposed a 200-bed \\"interracial\\" hospital for Washington, DC \\"predicated on obtaining a $2,000,000 grant from Congress to be matched by the contributions of Negroes throughout the country. Rev. Carnegie said the hospital would be interracial in the sense that both Negro and white physicians would be on its staff and that it would accept patients of all races, but that its primary function would be to serve a community of 800,000 Negroes in the northeast sector of Washington who are not now provided with adequate health facilities.\\" Carnegie proposes $4,000,000 for New York blacks He also proposed a 200-bed hospital for New York City that was to cost $4,000,000 reported the New York Times. But, he experienced at least one set back when only 100 Blacks appeared for a finance rally in support of the efforts. National magazines report Carnegie's efforts On October 1, 1953, Jet magazine reported that, \\"plans for a 200-bed Birmingham [AL] hospital, staffed by Negro doctors and nurses, were outlined to a group of white citizens by the Rev. Amos H. Carnegie, president of the National Hospital Foundation, Inc. Reverend Carnegie asked Negro employees to contribute fifty cents a week for twenty weeks to finance construction of the hospital. White trustees would control the money raised, Carnegie said.\\" Carnegie develops novel fundraising models Carnegie‚Äôs fundraising model varied depending upon the audience and the circumstances, always involving such grants, state and federal monies were available and sometimes proposing that Blacks donate a penny per week toward the construction of hospitals. Carnegie‚Äôs international influence grows international Indefatigable, the Rev. Carnegie was an inveterate letter writer to institutions, civic leaders and celebrities, with letters published in the New York Times, the Washington Post more than once, a collection of letters to Marion Anderson, and in the archives of Washington, DC's National Negro Opera Company. Rev. Carnegie wrote an article about desegregation that was cited widely by Blacks thinkers and organizers. He was cited various times in the national Black Jet magazine for his hospital plans, for being beaten while protesting Jim Crow bus segregation, when he refused to sit at the back of a bus, and for his arrest for fundraising in Birmingham, AL without a license. Carnegie takes his campaign to the radio Many newspapers' published schedules of radio programs in the 1940s and 50s included reports that the Rev. Carnegie would be speaking on issues of importance to Black people. Carnegie a returning hero in Jamaica In June 1950, Carnegie returned to Jamaica for the first time in almost four decades, as an ambassador for his United States hospital movement. The Kingston Gleaner newspaper of Jamaica reported with respect to the National Hospital Foundation, \\"At the head of this organization is its founder and director, the Rev. Amos H. Carnegie. Mr. Carnegie, paying his first visit to the homeland since he left it, visited the Gleaner yesterday and in a brief talk told of the success that the nationwide hospital scheme that he is directing...\\" Family life The Rev. Carnegie and his wife Susan had six children , including the Hon. Amos Hubert Carnegie, Jr., a New York state judge ; the late Rachel Virginia (Holland), Ph.D., professor of sociology ; the late Leanora M. (Leach), Ph.D., high school teacher ; the late Vida Mae (Gaynor), Ph.D., clinical psychologist and author and the late Joseph Carnegie, a New York labor organizer , as well as \\"Baby Carnegie\\" who was still born. In her autobiography, the late Vida Mae Carnegie (Gaynor), first- born daughter of the Rev. Carnegie, says that the reverend was often away from the home, failed to provide sustenance or appear for special events in her life, and made a \\"narcissistic\\" promise to fund her education on which he subsequently reneged, causing her to lose another scholarship that she would otherwise have received. The Reverend's late daughter angrily charges in her autobiography that her father should not have referred to himself as a \\"Reverend\\", since he did not pastor a church after 1933, according to her. However, the criticism is misplaced. For example, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. used the appellation \\"Reverend\\" throughout the Civil Rights Movement although he did not actively pastor an individual church during that period. The Rev. Carnegie's autobiography and that of his oldest daughter both recount that Rev. Carnegie did not always or often have a paid position as a pastor; was an itinerant organizer who subsisted financially from gifts from friends and supporters; often did not have money that he could use to support his family; and could not possibly have been present much in the home during those times when he was meeting civic leaders, politicians, clergy and the Black and white public for the purpose of organizing the construction of schools and hospitals. It is likely that his family suffered considerably even as the public profited from his civic activities. Rev. Carnegie's autobiography reviewed in New York Times In 1950, Rev. Carnegie published his autobiography, entitled, Faith Moves Mountains, which is available for free online. The New York Times twice announced the publication of the Reverend's autobiography, in April and June 1950. In The Reverend's autobiography, he does not provide the names of his parents or those of any of his siblings and only names one of his children - the oldest. His autobiography did not identify his parents or siblings by name. He does not mention that he is married and has children until a point in his autobiography that is long after his actual marriage and the birth of his children would have taken place. Rev. Carnegie's autobiography provides no details of his courtship, his wife's profession or the circumstances of their wedding. In fact, when the Negro Yearbook: a review of the events affecting Negro Life, reviewed the Reverend's autobiography in 1952, they observed that: :: The Reverend Mr. Carnegie has lived a most interesting life, but he lacks the ability to record it to best advantage. His main difficulty is a tendency to overlook all autobiographical details except religious ones. For example, he spent one full year at Virginia Union University, and all that he records of this experience is that he \\"converted\\" his roommate. The author has labeled this work \\"Volume I.\\" Presumably other volumes are to follow. Since he has lived so fully, one hopes that Mr. Carnegie in subsequent installments will give a picture of his whole life, not just those episodes connected with moral and religious uplift. When the Reverend's autobiography does mention his wife, he recounts only the disagreements they had over their lack of money. He quotes a discussion in which she asks him, surprised, how he managed to purchase food. He reports, word for word, that he responds to her in a manner that can only be described as sarcastic and dismissive. The Reverend reported that this type of conversation was typical. He expressed no regret. Although his five children experienced material deprivations in their childhoods, they were all successful adults. His late offspring included a judge; a college professor a grade school teacher; a clinical psychologist-author- educator and a union organizer. Rev. Carnegie dies The Rev. Amos H. Carnegie died in August, 1978 in Flushing, Queens, New York.

It is monotypic and the only species is Astroides calycularis, which is endemic to the western Mediterranean Sea. The species was first described in 1766 by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas. Description Astroides calycularis is a colonial coral, consisting of a group of polyps, each of which sits in a stony cup known as a calyx. The colonies are in diameter and high and each polyp is about in diameter. The polyps are yellow or orange, each with a fringe of about thirty very short tentacles surrounding a slit-shaped mouth. The colony grows by asexual reproduction, new polyps budding off existing polyps and secreting their own calices. Deep-water colonies are bush-shaped, the calices are circular and budding occurs at various heights on the calyx walls. Shallow-water colonies tend to be ellipsoid in shape, the calyces are polygonal and budding occurs in the centre of the colony as well as round the edges. Distribution and habitat A. calycularis During the Pleistocene, Astroides calycularis had a wider distribution than it does now, and was present in the whole of the western Mediterranean. Since then it has disappeared from the northern part of that range as a result of the lower sea temperatures that resulted from glaciation. Nowadays it is native to the part of the western Mediterranean Sea that is south of Sardinia and is also present in the Atlantic Ocean near the Strait of Gibraltar. Before 1989 it was restricted to the area west of Sicily, but in that year it appeared in the Adriatic Sea for the first time. This coincided with a sudden change of circulation in the eastern Mediterranean which may have allowed the short- lived pelagic larvae to survive long enough to settle on the seabed of the Croatian coast. A. calycularis is found on rocks and walls, under overhangs and in submarine caves at depths down to about . In suitable locations, colonies can cover 90% of the available substrate. In a cave in Italy, it was more common in better lit parts than was the solitary sunset cup coral (Leptopsammia pruvoti), and was more abundant near where sulphurous spring water flowed into the cave. Biology Astroides calycularis is nocturnal, the polyps remaining retracted back into their calices during the day. When expanded at night, they feed on zooplankton, small fish and perhaps bacteria. This coral is azooxanthellate, meaning it does not contain symbiotic dinoflagellates in its tissues as do many species of coral. A. calycularis colonies are gonochoristic with all the polyps in a colony being of the same sex. Males liberate sperm into the sea and fertilisation takes place in the coelenteron (gastric cavity) of the female. The eggs have yolks, and the embryos are brooded in the coelenteron until they are liberated into the water column as planula larvae.

As the 5th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, it served as infantry on the Western Front and in Italy during World War I. Its successor units served in air defence during the early part of World War II, and later as anti-tank gunners in the Burma Campaign. Volunteers The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett. One such unit was the 1st (Birmingham Rifles) Warwickshire RVC, formed on 20 October 1859 by Colonel the Hon Charles Granville Scott, formerly of the Scots Fusilier Guards, on behalf of the Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. Shortly afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel John Sanders, late of the 41st Bengal Native Infantry, assumed command. In March the following year it absorbed two other Birmingham-based units, the 3rd Warwickshire RVC raised on 8 November 1859, and the 6th raised on 8 February 1860. The whole was consolidated as the 1st Warwickshire RVC in March 1860 and the 'Birmingnham' subtitle was authorised by September.Beckett, Appendix VII.Frederick, pp. 281‚Äì2.Westlake, pp. 241‚Äì42.5th Warwicks at Regiments.orgJeff, pp. 6‚Äì7.Jeff, p. 13. Further companies were raised, and the unit soon reached a strength of 12 companies, one recruited from newspaper workers, one from gunmakers, and another from Scots residents in the city. A cadet corps of the battalion existed at King Edward's School from 1864 to 1866, and again from 1883 to 1884. At first the uniform was grey with green facings, then Rifle green with red facings was adopted in 1863.Army ListJeff, p. 10 On 14 June 1871, retired Major-General John Hinde, CB, (1814‚Äì81) formerly of the 8th Foot, was appointed Lieutenant- Colonel Commandant of the Birmingham Rifles.London Gazette, 16 June 1871.John Hinde at Nat Gould website On 4 March 1882 he was succeeded by Colonel William Swynfen Jervis, late of the Royal Munster Fusiliers, and one of the founders of Warwickshire County Cricket Club.London Gazette, 3 March 1882.W.S. Jervis at Cricket Archive. Thorp Street drill hall, now a car park In its early months the battalion paraded at Beardsworth's Horse Repository, but as numbers grew it moved at the invitation of the Cattle Show committee to Bingley Hall. This arrangement was never satisfactory, because the battalion could not use the hall for the duration of the cattle show in November and December each year. When the show committee also let the hall to a circus for three months in the spring of 1879, the battalion was temporarily housed in Mr Wiley's factory in Graham Street. The battalion now acquired a site of its own and a drill hall was built at Thorp Street, which remained in use until 1968.Jeff, pp. 7‚Äì8. Under the 'Localisation of Forces' scheme introduced by the Cardwell reforms, the Volunteers in Warwickshire were grouped with the two Regular battalions of the 6th Foot (Royal Warwickshire Regiment) and the two Warwickshire Militia regiments into Sub-District No 28 (County of Warwick), forming Brigade No 28 (Warwickshire). Following the Childers Reforms, the battalion became a Volunteer Battalion (VB) of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment on 1 July 1881, and was designated the 1st Volunteer Battalion of the regiment on 1 January 1883. Four new companies were added in 1891, the unit reorganising as a double battalion, the 1st Battalion having 'A' to 'H' Companies, the 2nd 'I' to 'Q' Companies. A cyclist section formed in 1894 had become a full company by 1900, together with 'U' Company formed of staff and students of Birmingham University. New cadet corps were formed at Solihull Grammar School and King Edward's School in 1904 and 1907 respectively. The Stanhope Memorandum of 1888 proposed a Mobilisation Scheme for units of the Volunteer Force, which would assemble by brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime the brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì86.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì61. The Volunteer Battalions of the Royal Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Worcestershire and Northamptonshire regiments were formed into a South Midland Volunteer Infantry Brigade, which in the event of war was to assemble at Warwick. Later, a separate Worcester and Warwickshire Volunteer Infantry Brigade was formed. Commanding Officers The following officers commanded the unit while it was part of the Volunteer Force: * Col Hon C.G. Scott (September‚ÄìNovember 1859) * Lt-Col J.W. Sanders (1859‚Äì60) * Lt-Col J. Oliver Mason (1860‚Äì67) * Lt-Col C. Ratcliffe (1867‚Äì71) * Maj-Gen J. Hinde, CB (1871‚Äì81) * Col William Swynfen Jervis (1882‚Äì1900) * Col W. Cox (1900‚Äì01; Lt-Col No 2 Bn 1891‚Äì1900) * Col C.J. Hart, CB, VD, TD (1901‚Äì08; Lt-Col No 1 Bn 1900‚Äì01) * Lt-Col W.R. Ludlow (No 2 Bn 1901‚Äì08) Boer War The Volunteer Battalions provided service companies to serve alongside the Regulars during the Second Boer War. Despite the large number who volunteered, only a half company was sent from the two battalions of the 1st VB. The contingent left Birmingham on 17 January 1900 and joined the 2nd Bn Royal Warwickshires, taking part in six actions at Elandsfontein, Pretoria, Pienaarsport, Diamond Hill, Edendale and Belfast. The 58-strong detachment suffered seven casualties, all but one dying from sickness. The battalion earned its first Battle Honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì02.Jeff, pp. 12‚Äì13.Leslie. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the Territorial Force (TF) in 1908 as part of the Haldane Reforms, the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Birmingham Rifles became the 5th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, and 6th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, respectively and the cyclist company was disbanded, while 'U' Company and the cadet corps became part of the Officer Training Corps. The battalion adopted the red uniform with blue facings of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. Both the 5th and 6th battalions were in the Warwickshire Brigade of the TF's South Midland Division.Jeff, p. 18.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 77‚Äì83.James, pp. 48‚Äì9. World War I Mobilisation On the outbreak of war in August 1914, the units of the South Midland Division had just arrived at Rhyl for annual training when orders recalled them to their home depots for mobilisation. 5th Battalion mobilised at Thorps Street under the command of Lt-Col A.I. Parkes.Jeff, p. 24.Jeff, p. 100. The Warwickshire Brigade first went to its war station at Portland. The division then concentrated around Chelmsford, where it formed part of Central Force. While the battalions trained for overseas service, so- called 2nd-Line battalions were authorised on 31 August to be formed at the home depots from men who either had not volunteered for overseas service or were unfit, together with the recruits flooding in. Thus the parent battalion at Chelmsford was designated the 1/5th Battalion, that at Thorp Street was the 2/5th Battalion. Later, a 3rd-Line or reserve battalion was also formed to train drafts for the other two.Jeff. p. 19.Royal Warwicks at Long, Long Trail.48 Division at Long, Long TrailRoyal Warwicks at WarpathBecke, Pt 2b, p. 6. 1/5th Royal Warwicks The South Midland Division was selected to proceed to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) early in 1915. Lt-Col A.C. Stewart, Corps of Guides, took over command of 1/5th Warwicks in February 1915. The battalion embarked at Southampton for Le Havre on 22 March 1915. Within days it began learning the routine of trench warfare around St Yves, Messines and Ploegsteert. On 12 May, the division was designated the 48th (South Midland) Division and the brigade became numbered as the 143rd (1/1st Warwickshire) Brigade. On 12 July 1915, Captain G.C. Sladen, Rifle Brigade, assumed command with the rank of Temporary Lt-Col. The battalion moved south to a section of the line around H√©buterne, Foncquevillers and Gommecourt.Jeff, p. 26. Somme The first offensive operation of the 1/5th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment was on 1 July 1916 at the Battle of the Somme. Together with 1/7th, the battalion held a two-mile stretch of trench adjoining the attack of 31st Division towards Serre. They were not to attack, but made simulated preparations for doing so. The enemy wire was cut, and they released smoke just before zero hour, but no assembly trenches had been dug nor was the British wire cut, and the German defenders were not fooled. 31st Division was dreadfully cut up, as was the rest of 143 Brigade, which had attacked with 4th Division.Edmonds, pp. 426‚Äì27. During the Battle of Bazentin Ridge, the battalion captured Ovillers-la-Boisselle on the night of 15/16 July. The prospects for the attack were unpromising: the troops were exhausted before the attack and were suffering from the effects of lachrymatory gas shells; the men were too closely bunched and the waves too close together; and there was no artillery support. Nevertheless, in the dark, a party of the 1/5th Battalion led by Charles Carrington hit on a weak spot in the German defences with no machine gun cover, and captured a trench well behind the German main position without losing a man. Carrington persuaded his superiors not to withdraw his men, and the following morning the cut-off main German position surrendered.Griffiths, pp 59‚Äì60. The 1/5th Battalion was involved in the following further operations during the Battle of the Somme: * Battle of Pozi√®res Ridge, 23‚Äì27 July and 13‚Äì28 August 1916 * Battle of the Ancre Heights, 3‚Äì11 November 1916 * Battle of the Ancre, 13‚Äì18 November 1916 Lt-Col Sladen was promoted to command 143rd Bde, and Lt-Col C. Retallack was appointed to succeed him as CO on 4 September. By December the battalion occupied trenches at Le Sars. Casualties during the Somme campaign had been heavy. Company Serjeant-Major F. Townley was awarded the Military Cross (MC) after he had twice taken command of A Company when all the officers became casualties.Jeff, p. 33. The 1/5th Battalion was involved in the following operations during the German Retreat to the Hindenburg Line in March and April 1917: * Occupation of Peronne, 18 March 1916 * The battalion advanced on √âpehy in April Ypres In July the battalion entrained at Authie for Proven in Belgium. After a short period of training it took part in the Third Battle of Ypres * Battle of Langemarck, 16‚Äì18 August 1917: Serious losses were suffered in an impossible situation near St Julien; Lt-Col Retallack was severely wounded, leaving Capt W.H. Bloomer in temporary command * Battle of Polygon Wood, 28 September‚Äì3 October 1917 * Battle of Broodseinde, 4 October 1917: Lt- Col W.C.C. Gell, who had assumed command in September, led another attack at St Julien, which was an outstanding success * Battle of Poelcappelle, 9 October 1917 The battalion was moved to Vimy and returned to trench duty and rest periods. Italy On 10 November 1917, the 48th Division received orders to move to Italy. The battalion entrained at Ligny-Saint-Flochel; HQ and C Companies travelled via the Mont Cenis Tunnel, A, B and D Companies by the Riviera route. They detrained at Bovolone near Verona on 27 November.Jeff, p. 28. By 1 December the division had concentrated around Legnago on the Adige. On 1 March 1918, the division relieved 7th Division in the front line of the Montello sector on the Piave Front, and held the line until 16 March. On 1 April, it moved westward into reserve for the middle sector of the Asiago Plateau Front. When the Austrians attacked the Asiago Plateau during the Battle of the Piave River on 15 June, 1/5th Bn was occupying the Cesuna re- entrant. The understrength D Company occupied the right front, with partly obscured fields of fire, while B Company on the left had good fields of fire. A and C Companies were in support between the Cesuna switch trench and Battalion HQ at Perghele Farm., a high promontory with steep clear slopes to the front and sides. D Company was quickly overrun and its commander captured. The neighbouring battalions were also driven back, opening a potentially dangerous breach in the line. When Battalion HQ went forward to investigate, the acting CO, second-in-command, adjutant and intelligence officer all became casualties, leaving Regimental Serjeant-Major Townley to take charge once more. He organised a defensive post of battalion cooks and orderlies at Perghele Farm, even though the farmhouse had been captured, and held out for 4 hours until relieved by a company of 1/6th Warwicks, while 1/7th Warwicks restored the line. The following day 143rd Bde went over to the counter-attack and regained all the lost ground. 1/6th Battalion was relieved on 17 June and went into reserve at Busibello where Lt-Col Gell returned to take command. The 1/5th Battalion took part in other engagements during August and September in the Mount Kaberlaba sector, returning to Granezza between each tour of duty.Jeff, pp. 30‚Äì32. At the end of October, the Austrians began to withdraw (the Battle of Vittorio Veneto) and 143rd Bde followed up along the Valle d'Assa, covering up to per day. Led by 1/5th Bn, it reached Osteria del Termine on 2 November, being the first British formation to enter enemy territory on the European fronts. The following day the 48th Division surrounded and captured a large force of Austrian troops including the corps commander and three divisional commanders. By 15.00 on 4 November, when the Armistice with Austria came into force, the division had pushed forward into the Trentino with 1/5th Bn at Faida. After the conclusion of hostilities the division was withdrawn to Italy for the winter. Demobilisation for 1/5th Bn began on 23 December and parties left at intervals. On 3 April 1919, the residual cadre of battalion under Maj Bloomer marched through Birmingham from New Street Station to Thorp Street by torchlight.Jeff, p. 39. The battalion was formally disembodied on 2 May 1919. 2/5th Royal Warwicks The 2/5th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment was formed in Birmingham in October 1914, but at first the men lived at home, and little or nothing was available in terms of uniforms, arms or equipment. It was not until the 2nd South Midland Division concentrated at Northampton in January 1915 that the men were issued with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles with which to train. Here they formed part of First Army of Central Force, but when the 1st South Midland Division went to France, the 2nd took its place at Chelmsford and became part of Third Army of Central Force, with a definite role in Home Defence. The battalions formed their machine gun sections while at Chelmsford, but the strength of the battalions fluctuated widely as they were drawn upon for drafts for their 1st-Line battalions. In August 1915 the division was numbered as the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division and the brigade became the 182nd (2nd Warwickshire) Brigade.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 33‚Äì39.61 Division at Long, Long Trail. In February and March 1916 the units of 61st Division moved to Salisbury Plain to begin final training for overseas service. Here they were issued with .303 SMLE rifles in place of the Japanese weapons, and Lewis guns in place of dummy guns and antique Maxim guns. Final leave was granted in April and May and the division entrained for France, concentrating at IX Corps' rest area by 28 May. The 2/5th Battalion's first action was the Battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916, a diversionary attack in support of the Somme Offensive. The attack was badly handled and casualties were heavy. The 61st Division was so badly mauled that it was not used offensively again in 1916. Thereafter, the battalion was involved in the following operations: * Operations on the Ancre, 11‚Äì15 January 1917 * German Retreat to the Hindenburg Line, 14 March‚Äì5 April 1917 * Battle of Langemarck, 16‚Äì18 August 1917 * Battle of Cambrai: ** German counter- attacks, 1‚Äì3 December 1917. Due to the manpower shortage being suffered by the BEF, 2/5th Bn Royal Warwickshire Regiment was disbanded on 20 February 1918; some of the men being drafted into the 2/6th Bn, the rest into 24th Entrenching Battalion. 3/5th Royal Warwicks The 3/5th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment formed in Birmingham in May 1915 and joined the South Midland Reserve Grou, moving to Weston-super-Mare in Somerset. It became the 5th (Reserve) Battalion, Royal Warwicks, on 8 April 1916, moved to Ludgershall, Wiltshire, and absorbed the 6th Reserve Battalion on 1 September that year, when the reserve group was entitled the South Midland Reserve Brigade in the Training Reserve. It spent the winter of 1916‚Äì17 at Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, moving to Catterick, North Yorkshire, by March. In the Summer of 1917 it moved to Northumberland and remained in Blyth as part of the Tyne Garrison until the end of the war. It was disbanded on 17 April 1919 at Cramlington. 18th Royal Warwicks The remaining Home Service men were separated from the 3rd Line battalions in May 1915 and formed into Provisional Battalions for home defence. The men of the four TF Bns of the Royal Warwicks (5th, 6th, 7th and 8th) formed 81st Provisional Battalion in 10th Provisional Brigade.Army Council Instructions, January 1916, Appendix 18.Porter The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. The Provisional Battalions thus became anomalous, and on 1 January 1917 became numbered battalions of their parent units, the 81st becoming 18th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, at Bath, Somerset, and transferred to 215th Brigade in 72nd Division. It moved to Bedford later in January, and then to Ipswich in May 1917. Part of the unit's role was physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting oversea, and 18th Royal Warwicks remained in the East Coast defences for the rest of its service. It was disbanded on 19 January 1918.Army Council Instructions, December 1916, Appendix 204. Interwar The 5th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, was reformed on 7 February 1920 when the TF was reconstituted (retitled Territorial Army (TA) in 1921). Lieutenant-Colonel E.V. Sydenham, DSO, was appointed CO, with Maj W.C.C. Gell, DSO, MC, as second-in-command; Maj Gell succeeded to the command on 16 February 1924. Two companies of the battalion paraded at Thorp Street on Tuesday each week, the other two on Thursday, while 6th Warwicks paraded on Mondays and Wednesdays. Once again, both battalions formed part of 143rd (Warwickshire) Infantry Brigade in the 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division.Titles and Designations, 1927. At this period the 5th Bn had the Five Ways Grammar School Cadet Corps and Birmingham Cadet Corps, Jewish Lads' Brigade attached to it. Anti-Aircraft conversion 90 cm 'Projector Anti- Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of Territorial infantry battalions into searchlight battalions of the Royal Engineers (RE). The 5th Royal Warwickshires was one unit selected for this role, becoming 45th (The Royal Warwickshire Regiment) AA Battalion, RE on 9 December 1936, consisting of HQ and four AA companies (378‚Äì381). At the same time, 6th Warwicks converted to 69th (Royal Warwickshire Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery. Since the establishment of an AA battalion was much larger than an infantry battalion or an AA brigade, 69th AA Bde moved out of Thorp Street to Kings Heath, 379 Company to a new drill hall at Kingstanding, and 381 Company to one at Golden Hillock Road near the Birmingham Small Arms Company factory.Frederick, pp. 859, 867.Jeff, p. 41.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 110, 114. Both the new units were subordinated to 32nd (South Midland) Anti-Aircraft Group (later Brigade) in 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division.2nd AA Division 1936 at British Military History In 1937, 45th AA Battalion formed an additional company at Birmingham, numbered 399. In November 1938 this company was transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) to provide the cadre for a new 59th (Warwickshire) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery. 594 LAA Rgt at Regiments.orgMonthly Army List January 1939.Jeff, p. 43. 45th AA Battalion was transferred to 34th AA Brigrade in 1938, but was in a new 54th AA Brigade by the outbreak of war. World War II Mobilisation The TA's AA units, including 45th AA Bn, were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì63. In February 1939, the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. The battalion was mobilised on 15 July and until 15 August it manned a S/L layout in the East Midlands.Jeff, p. 45. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations, with 45th AA Bn manning 50 S/L sites around Birmingham by 27 August.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì66, 371. 45th Searchlight Regiment Home Defence On the outbreak of World War II, 45th AA Bn was assigned to a new 54th AA Brigade being formed at Sutton Coldfield near Birmingham, as part of 4th AA Division.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files4 AA Division 1939 at British Military HistoryRoutledge Table LX, p. 378. The battalion established its HQ at Kingstanding Drill Hall, and the S/L sites were manned by 380 and 381 AA Companies, with HQs at Halesowen and Maxstoke Castle respectively. Meanwhile, 378 and 379 AA Companies manned Lewis guns in the Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) role to defend various vital points (VPs), including Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory, RAF Cosford, RAF Shawbury and RAF Ternhill. By mid-December, the commitments at the VPs had been handed over to specialist LAA units, and the battalion was wholly engaged in S/L duties, with company HQs distributed as follows: * 378 at Maxstoke Castle, later at Sheldon and then Shenstone during 1940‚Äì41 * 379 at Halesowen * 380 at Shirley, with a temporary operational HQ at Hewell Grange in November‚ÄìDecember 1940 * 381 at Pendeford Hill, later at Shenstone, Wightwick Hall, Weston Park and finally Arbury Park In August 1940, the remaining AA units of the RE were transferred to the RA, the unit being redesignated 45th (The Royal Warwickshire Regiment) Searchlight Regiment, RA, and the AA companies becoming S/L batteries.Litchfield, pp. 242‚Äì43.45 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M, pp. 338‚Äì39. In a reorganisation of AA Command in November 1940, 54 AA Bde assumed responsibility for searchlight provision for the Gun Defence Areas (GDAs) of the West Midlands under a new 11th AA Division.11 AA Division British Military History11 AA Division at RA 39‚Äì45 Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex D, p. 260.Routledge Table LXV, p. 396. 11th AA Divisional sign After the initial deployment, the periods of greatest activity for 45th S/L Rgt were in August 1940, when it suffered five casualties in the first raids of the Birmingham Blitz, in November when there were heavy raids on Birmingham and Coventry, and again in March and April 1941. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 237th S/L Training Rgt at Holywood, County Down, where it provided the basis for a new 552 S/L Bty formed on 16 January 1941. This battery later joined a newly-forming 91st S/L Rgt.Frederick, p. 862. The S/L layouts had been based on a spacing of 3500 yards, but due to equipment shortages this had been extended to 6000 yards by September 1940. In November this was changed to clusters of three lights to improve illumination, but this meant that the clusters had to be spaced 10,400 yards apart. Each S/L Troop manned two clusters. The cluster system was an attempt to improve the chances of picking up enemy bombers and keeping them illuminated for engagement by AA guns or Night fighters. Eventually, one light in each cluster was to be equipped with SLC radar and act as 'master light', but the radar equipment was still in short supply.Routledge, pp. 388‚Äì89, 93. In May 1941, site BGo 31 at Shirley was credited with bringing down a Heinkel He 111 bomber. The Troop officer, Lt P.A.G. Osler, described how the Heinkel flew over the site four times, being illuminated by the lights and engaged with small arms fire (each S/L site was equipped with Lewis guns). After the fourth run the aircraft veered away and crashed into trees, where its bombload exploded. In June 1941, two S/L sites received direct hits and three men were wounded, but there was little activity of the rest of the year.Jeff, p. 46. On 1 September 1941, Brevet Colonel A.W. Ward-Walker, TD, who had been Commanding Officer since 16 February 1934, relinquished command and was succeeded by Lt- Col C.D. Oliver, promoted from 44th (Leicestershire Regiment) S/L Rgt.Jeff, p. 105. In 1941, the searchlight layout over the Midlands was reorganised, so that any hostile raid approaching the GDAs around the towns must cross more than one searchlight belt, and then within the GDAs the concentration of lights was increased.Routledge, p. 399. The regiment was undergoing redeployment in December 1941 when it was announced that it was being considered for conversion to the LAA gun role. This opportunity for greater involvement was welcomed by the regiment, which handed over its S/L sites to 80th S/L Rgt in December and January 1942. 122nd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment A cadre of six officers and 30 other ranks went to Bradford for training on Bofors guns before the regiment formally converted on 2 February 1942 as 122nd (Royal Warwickshire) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, with the batteries renumbered as 400‚Äì403 LAA Batteries.>Frederick, pp. 806‚Äì7, 839.122 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. The rest of the regiment went for training on 12 February and a month later the batteries moved from Bradford to various practice camps. In April they took over defence of VPs, three batteries in North Staffordshire and one on Anglesey, with RHQ near Chester. A Bofors gun featuring the 'Stiffkey Sight'. During the Spring of 1942, the Luftwaffe began a new tactic of 'hit and run' raids by single-engined Fighter-bombers against targets along the South Coast of England, and AA Command moved LAA units south to deal with this threat. In July, 122nd LAA Rgt moved from 54 AA Bde to join 71 AA Bde in Kent, deployed as follows:Routledge, pp. 402‚Äì03.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/81. * RHQ at Shepherdswell * 400 LAA Bty at Rye, East Sussex * 401 LAA Bty at Betteshanger * 402 LAA Bty at Minster-in-Thanet, later at Rye, where it was awarded a Category 1 'kill' on 12 October * 403 LAA Bty at Shepherdswell. 122nd LAA Rgt was now selected for overseas service. On 3 October, 403 LAA Bty was re-regimented with a newly formed 143rd LAA Rgt and the rest of the regiment, now with the three-battery organisation of a mobile AA unit, left AA Command and moved to Dropmore Hall, Burnham, Buckinghamshire, for battle training. A month later it went for mobile training at Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. While awaiting overseas postings, AA units were usually loaned back to AA Command, and on 22 December the regiment took over operational sites in Cornwall under 63 AA Bde, with RHQ at Perranporth and sites at RAF St Eval, St Austell and Porthcothan. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1943, it attended No 13 AA Practice Camp at Aberaeron, before coming under War Office Control. On 14 February, it moved to Leeds under orders to mobilise for a tropical climate.Jeff, p. 49.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 18 February 1943, TNA file WO 212/9 and WO 33/1987. India The regiment embarked at Gourock on the Firth of Clyde on 10 March 1943 aboard HM Transport Strathnaver. It docked at Durban on 14 April and the regiment went into camp for six weeks before re-embarking on HMT Strathmore on 14 May, to land at Bombay on 10 June. The regiment then travelled across India to Ranchi to join 7th Indian Infantry Division. On 20 August the regiment moved to Khumbargaon and joined 36th Indian Infantry Division. Early in September the regiment received its lorries and Bofors guns and began intensive training. On 30 November the regiment underwent a major change in organisation and role. Two of its LAA batteries, 400 and the newly formed 'X' Bty, joined 100 (Gordon Highlanders) Anti-Tank Regiment, RA, and in exchange it received 168 and 321 A/T Btys (the latter being newly formed) equipped with 6-pounder A/T guns. The regiment was subsequently redesignated 122 LAA/AT Regiment.Frederick, pp. 927‚Äì8.Joslen, pp. 526‚Äì27.Jeff, p. 50.Farndale, Far East, Annex K.Farndale, Far East, p. 174.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, Appendix 15.36 Indian Division at British Military History 36th Indian Division formation sign The division was training for Operation Porpoise, a projected amphibious assault,Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 6, 66, 119, 127. but the opening of the Japanese offensive in the Arakan in February 1944 changed everything, and elements of the division (including 168 A/T Bty serving with 130th Field Rgt) were employed in mopping up after the attack had been stopped.Jeff, p. 51.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 117, 147, 155, 267‚Äì69.Farndale, Far East, p. 182. The amphibious plans were cancelled and, in May 1944, 122 LAA/AT Rgt moved by rail and riverboat to Shillong, where it was rejoined by 168 A/T Bty and where 36th Indian Division reorganised as a standard infantry division.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 252, 274.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, p. 25 and Appendix 18. Early in July 1944, infantry units of the division started to fly from Ledo into Myitkyina airfield in North Burma to reinforce the US-led Northern Combat Area Command. They saw much bitter fighting in the following campaign, but left the divisional artillery behind. However, 321 A/T Bty did move up to Ledo under the command of 178th Field Rgt, ready to move into the forward area; it returned to the regiment at Shillong in September. The division was recategorised as British on 1 September 1944, becoming 36th British Infantry Division.Joslen, pp. 63‚Äì64. 122nd Anti-Tank Regiment Burma 3-inch Mortar in action during the Burma Campaign. Meanwhile, 122 LAA/AT Rgt was redesignated 122 (Royal Warwickshire Regiment) A/T Rgt on 14 September, and lost its LAA guns, reorganising into three batteries, each composed of twelve 6-pounder A/T guns and twelve 3-inch mortars, still commanded by Lt-Col Oliver.Frederick, p. 928. Once it rejoined, it served as the divisional anti-tank regiment in 36th Division until the end of the war. On 29 October 1944, 168 Bty moved to Moran and three days later was flown to the forward area. Under the command of 26 Indian Bde it remained in contact with the enemy until the closing weeks of the campaign. It distinguished itself on 1‚Äì2 February 1945 supporting 2nd Bn The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) at Myitson where an attempt to infiltrate over the Shweli River had miscarried, but suffered its heaviest casualties on 3 February.Jeff, pp. 52‚Äì53.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 196, 275. The main body of the regiment (RHQ, F Troop of 321 Bty and 402 Bty) remained at Shillong until 12 November, when it was moved by road to the Ledo area and began intensive training. On 22 December, it left Ledo in convoy and moved up to join he forward troops of 36th Division. It crossed the Irrawaddy River between 13 and 16 January 1945. During early February 1945, a further reorganisation took place: 168 and 402 Btys were now wholly equipped with 3-inch mortars, leaving only F Trp, 321 Bty, with 6-pounders. The regiment was now also engaged in the attempts to cross the Shweli, where the Japanese were well dug-in. It crossed between 25 February and 2 March, having fired 9500 mortar rounds and 120 6-pounder rounds in a month of supporting the infantry units held up on the far bank, sometimes dropping mortar bombs accurately only a few yards in front of them. During the advance, 26th Indian Bde converged with the rest of 36th Indian Division on the Shweli River, until 168 Bty was back in touch with the regiment. It was relieved by 402 Bty on 12 March. During March and April, F Trp operated firstly with 72 Bde and later with 29 Bde at Thazi Township, frequently firing its A/T guns over the river into Japanese bunkers.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 276‚Äì78. It was not possible to maintain all the divisions in Burma, and many troops from 36th Division were due for repatriation to the UK under the 'Python' scheme, having served in the Far East for longer than 3 years and 8 months. The division was therefore sent back to India. 122nd A/T Regiment was flown from Meiktila to Imphal and Chittagong, then began the long journey by road and rail to Poona on 6 May.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 27, 325. Once at Poona, the regiment rested and reorganised, while 36th Division where it went into training for Operation Zipper, the proposed amphibious invasion of Malaya. However, the war had ended with the Surrender of Japan on 15 August, Lieutenant-Colonel Oliver relinquished the command on 26 June, being replaced on 20 August by Lt-Col J.W. Calver from 21st West African A/T Rgt. The regiment was transferred from 36th Division to XV Corps at Coimbatore and re- equipped with 4.2-inch mortars in place of the 3-inch. Demobilisation began in October 1954 and the regiment was placed in suspended animation on 15 September 1946.Jeff, p. 54. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment reformed at Birmingham as 580 (The Royal Warwickshire Regiment) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, with RHQ and two batteries at Thorp Street, and one battery at the Drill Hall, Shirley. It reverted to the LAA role in 1950 and about that time the subtitle changed to '5th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment'. It formed part of 80 AA Brigade (the former 54 AA Brigade) at Sutton Coldfield. In 1952, one battery moved from Thorp Street to Taunton Road, Balsall Heath, and the battery at Shirley moved to Mossfield Road, Kings Heath. The following year a fourth battery was raised.Frederick, p. 1024.Jeff, pp. 62‚Äì64.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. 564‚Äì591 Rgts at British Army 1945 on.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on. When AA Command was disbanded in 1955, there was a reduction in the number of AA units in the TA. 580 LAA Rgt was amalgamated with 469 (The Royal Warwickshire Regiment) HAA Rgt, 594 (Warwickshire) LAA Regiment and 672 (Worcestershire) HAA Regiment to form 442 LAA Regiment, Royal Artillery. (469 Rgt was the former 6th Battalion, Royal Warwicks, formed from the Birmingham Rifles in 1908, and 594 Regiment was the former 59th Searchlight Regiment formed in 1938 from a cadre provided by the 45th.) The new unit was organised as follows:ref name = Frederick1024/>Frederick, p. 1014.414‚Äì443 Rgts at British Army 1945 on. * RHQ and 'P (5/6th Royal Warwicks)' Battery at Thorpe Street ‚Äì from 469 and 580 Regiments * 'Q (Warwickshire)' Battery ‚Äì from 594 Regiment * 'R (Worcestershire)' Battery ‚Äì from 672 Regiment In 1961, 442 LAA Regiment was broken up: 'Q' Battery joined 268 (Warwickshire) Field Regiment, 'R' Battery joined 444 (Staffordshire) LAA Regiment. The remainder of the regiment (RHQ and 'P (5/6th Royal Warwicks)' Battery) were absorbed by the 7th Battalion, Royal Warwicks. This battalion had previously absorbed the 8th Battalion, so the lineages of all four TA battalions of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment were merged. C Company of 7th Bn was based at Thorp Street until the drill hall went out of use in 1968.Royal Warwicks at British Army 1945 on. Insignia From 1947 to 1955, the regiment wore an arm flash in the form of a horizontal scarlet strip. Honorary Colonel The following served as Honorary Colonel of the battalion: * Col C.J.

During the Texas Revolution, he led a company of men fighting in the Texian Army and was wounded at the Battle of San Jacinto. He was named a brigadier general of the Republic of Texas militia. Early years Moseley Baker was born September 20, 1802 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Horace Baker and Rebecca Moseley.Cutrer, Handbook of Texas. He moved to Montgomery, Alabama as a young man. There he became a lawyer, and was also the founder and first editor of the Montgomery Advertiser.Moore (2004), p. 31. He was elected to the Alabama State Legislature in 1829 and was elected Speaker of the House. Baker lived above his means and soon found himself deeply in debt. In 1832 he was arrested for defrauding the Bank of Alabama. He soon escaped and made his way to Mexican Texas. He arrived in San Felipe de Austin with only $1 in his pocket. After borrowing $10 from another resident, he opened his own law practice. Baker, his wife, and their daughter moved to Liberty in March 1835. In October he was granted land in Lorenzo de Zavala's colony on Galveston Bay. Texas Revolution 1835 As relations soured between Texas colonists and the Mexican government, Baker began to advocate for independence from Mexico. In July 1835, Mexican general Martin Perfecto de Cos issued warrants for the arrest of Baker and five other men, all accused of land speculation or being part of the Anahuac Disturbances.The other men were Robert M. Williamson, William Barret Travis, Samuel May Williams, Frank W. Johnson, and Lorenzo de Zavala. Local officials refused to enforce the warrants, and the men were never arrested. All of the men were well respected in their communities, and the warrants greatly angered other colonists. This, combined with news that Cos was leading a large military force to Texas, convinced many colonists to embrace the idea of revolt. In August, Baker began recruiting men willing to fight for independence. War broke out in October 1835. Baker was a private at the first battle, in Gonzales. When that battle ended, Baker accompanied the bulk of the army to San Antonio de B√©xar, where they commenced a siege of Cos's troops, garrisoned in the Alamo Mission. There were several small skirmishes during the siege. Baker fought in the Grass Fight and participated in the final assault on the city in early December. Cos's troops were defeated and marched out of Texas. With no Mexican troops remaining in Texas, many Texans believed the war was over. Men, including Baker, left the army to return to their families. In February 1836, however, Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna led a large contingent of Mexican troops into Texas. Santa Anna brought the bulk of his army to B√©xar, where they besieged the small Texan force garrisoned at the Alamo. Texan commander William B. Travis sent dispatches around the region, begging for reinforcements. 1836 On February 29, 1836 Baker joined the militia newly organized at San Felipe. He was elected captain of the company, which had about 30 members. The company arrived in Gonzales on March 6 to join the other forces that were gathering to reinforce the Alamo.Moore (2004), p. 33. As no central commander was present, the men elected Baker to take charge of all of the recruits in Gonzales. He marched them to the east bank of the Guadalupe River, about below the town, and made camp.Moore (2004), p.34. Sam Houston arrived in Gonzales about 4 pm on March 11. He announced that the Convention of 1836 had declared Texas an independent nation and read the men the Texas Declaration of Independence. The new interim government had placed Houston in charge of the recruits gathered in Gonzales. That evening, two men arrived from B√©xar with news that the Mexican army had retaken the Alamo, and the Texian defenders were dead; Houston promptly arrested the men as spies.Moore (2004), p. 43. The following day, Houston organized the army. All of the companies gathered, including Baker's, were placed into the First Regiment of Infantry, with Edward Burleson in charge.Moore (2004), p. 48. Houston sent scouts to determine what had actually happened in B√©xar. They returned on March 13 with Susanna Dickinson, who had been inside the Alamo during the battle. Dickinson warned that more than 2,000 Mexican troops were on their way to Gonzales. Local citizens panicked; Houston ordered an immediate retreat, promising that his new army would protect the citizens as they fled.Moore (2004), pp. 55-60. Baker and the rest of the army marched for 26 of the next 38 hours.Moore (2004), p. 71. Over the next week, the Texian army continued to head east and north, away from the Mexican soldiers. Texian volunteers flocked to Houston's force. Baker helped with the recruitment; on March 22 he wrote a letter to the Telegraph and Texas Register, calling for volunteers and asking the women of Texas to convince their husbands and sons to join.Moore (2004), p. 107. On March 23, news reached Houston's army that General James Fannin had been defeated at the Battle of Coleto.Moore (2004), p. 109. Houston ordered another retreat, so Baker and his men headed east toward the Brazos River.Moore (2004), p. 115. After a brief rest in San Felipe, Houston ordered the army to march to Groce's Landing, away. Baker and Captain Wyly Martin absolutely refused to retreat further.Moore (2004), p. 136. Houston chose not to directly challenge the men, fearing he would lose control of his army if Baker or Martin were able to gather enough troops to their perspective. Instead, he gave each of them orders to remain behind and protect key crossings along the Brazos.Moore (2004), pp. 134, 137. At this point, Baker had about 40 men with him. His company built fortifications along the east bank of the Brazos, directly across the river from San Felipe. By March 31, they had dug an L-shaped ditch, long, and piled tree branches in front.Moore (2004), p. 140. Two days later, Baker's men found four survivors from Fannin's regiment wandering the prairie. The men had escaped after the Battle of Refugio and were searching for the remainder of the Texian army.Moore (2004), p. 157. One of the survivors, Samuel G. Hardaway, joined Baker's company.Moore (2004), p. 158. Baker requested reinforcements to hold the San Felipe crossing, and within days had about 120 men under his command. He informed Houston this ought to be a large enough number to hold the crossing against the Mexican army. On March 29, scouts Deaf Smith and John York mistook a cattle drive for a cavalry troop and informed Baker that the Mexican army was only a few miles from his position. Baker ordered that the town be burned, saying Houston had ordered it so.Houston flatly denied giving this order. Moses Austin Bryan, nephew of the founder of San Felipe, refused to start the fires, so Baker personally set a torch to the first home.Moore (2004), p. 141. Baker and his men remained camped on the east bank. Santa Anna's troops marched into San Felipe at dawn on April 7. Knowing that the Mexican army was close, on April 6 Baker had ordered his men to hide all the boats and rafts along the river. He then sent three men as pickets on the west bank. Private Bill Simpson took the third watch, and promptly fell asleep. The Mexican advance guard captured him; the other two escaped and made it to safety with the rest of Baker's troops. Simpson told Santa Anna everything he knew - that Houston was at Groce's Landing with an army numbering approximately 800 men, and that the Texian army meant to retreat all the way to the Trinity River if the Mexican army crossed the Brazos.Moore (2004), pp. 176-178. Throughout that day and the next, Baker's troops were under near-constant fire from Mexican snipers and artillery. Private John Bricker was hit with grapeshot from the cannon, becoming the first Texian casualty of the San Jacinto campaign.Moore (2004), p. 181. Mexican troops built several rafts, but Baker's men fired enough that Santa Anna decided it was unwise to try to cross at that point.Moore (2004), p. 182. By April 9, the Mexican artillery maneuvered close enough to strike Baker's makeshift fortifications. Heavy rains caused the river to rise, and the Texian camp was soon surrounded by floodwaters. Their only way out was the main road. Baker called for a vote, and the men voted to retreat. Soon after they left, Mexican forces withdrew from San Felipe, and none of the scouts were able to discern where they had gone.Moore (2004), p. 188. Baker's men and those of Wyly Martin rejoined the main body of Houston's army in the middle of the night of April 14.Moore (2004), p. 214. Houston ordered an early march on April 15. Martin told Houston that his men deserved a chance to rest and eat breakfast, and they would not be marching until after they had done so. Angry, Houston ordered Martin to eat and then escort the Texian families fleeing the area to the Trinity River. Worried he would be ordered to take care of women and children instead of fighting the Mexican army, Baker ordered his men to be ready to march - without their breakfast.Moore (2004), pp. 216-7. The Texian army made camp at Lynchburg, on the banks of Buffalo Bayou, on April 19. The following day, Santa Anna his portion of the Mexican army to a campsite less than away. Eager to test the strength of the Texians, Santa Anna sent his artillery, a 9- or 12-pounder cannon known as the Golden Standard, to a spot about from where the Texians had concealed themselves in a grove of timber.Moore (2004), p. 265. Houston ordered Captain James C. Neill to take the two Texian cannon to the edge of the trees and return fire.Moore (2004), p. 266. The cannons traded shots for approximately 30 minutes. Both Neill and Mexican Captain Fernando Urriza, who commanded the Golden Standard's crew, were injured. The infantry were eager to join the fight; Baker later recounted that \\"it was with the utmost difficulty that I could prevent my company from rushing on the enemy\\".Moore (2004), p. 267. The skirmish lasted for three and one-half hours, with a small number of cavalry and infantry on each side engaging. Mexican forces finally withdrew to their camp.Moore (2004), p. 269. Later that afternoon, Houston allowed Colonel Sidney Sherman to take the Texian cavalry and skirmish again. Part of the Mexican infantry joined the battle, and Sherman was forced to withdraw when Houston refused to send in a larger part of his force.Moore (2004), pp. 274-282. Many Texian soldiers, including Baker, were angry that Houston had not allowed the rest of the infantry to join the fight. Baker began composing a letter on behalf of the army, complaining that Houston had no intention of engaging in battle, and would instead delay until Santa Anna's troops had been reinforced and grossly outnumbered the Texian army.Moore (2004), p. 282. Santa Anna received approximately 400 reinforcements at 8 a.m. the following morning, bringing his army to 1,250 men. Texian troops were convinced that a Mexican attack was imminent.Moore (2004), p. 291.Moore (2004), p. 298. Santa Anna's men had spent much of the night preparing for a Texian attack, building makeshift breastworks around their exposed camp. The newly arrived troops were no better rested - they had marched continuously for 24 hours with no sleep or food.Moore (2004), p. 292. As the morning faded away with no sign that the Texians were preparing an attack, Santa Anna relaxed his guard. His troops, including those who had been standing guard, were given permission to rest. At noon, Houston held a council of war with his senior officers. They voted to fight at some point that day.Moore (2004), p. 302. Edward Burleson, commander of the First Regiment of Texian Volunteers, called the officers under his command together. They were asked to vote on whether to attack at 4 pm that day or 4 am the following morning. Baker was one of only two officers to vote for the pre-dawn hour.Moore (2004), p. 311. The Second Regiment held a similar vote. At 3:30 pm, the Texian army lined up.Moore (2004), p. 312. Baker's men, as Burleson's First Regiment, were in the center of the line.Moore (2004), p. 313. Baker addressed the men, giving a \\"rousing, inspirational\\" speech that referenced the sacrifices both civilians and members of the Texan military had endured.Cushman (2010), p. 171. The speech ended with \\"Remember Goliad! Remember the Alamo!\\".Cushman (2010), p. 173. Baker's men reportedly hoisted a red handkerchief to serve as their flag, and as a warning to the Mexican troops that they would offer no quarter.Moore (2004), p. 314. At 4 pm, the Texian army advanced, commencing the Battle of San Jacinto. They crept forward in silence, hidden by the tall grass.Moore (2004), p. 316. Houston ordered them to charge when they were about from the Mexican camp. Baker was one of the first wounded; First Lieutenant John Borden stepped forward to lead his company.Moore (2004), p. 325. Later years From October 1836 through June 1837, Baker served in the First Congress of the Republic of Texas, representing Austin County. He attempted to impeach Houston, who had been elected President of the new country; the impeachment proceedings failed. After his term expired, Baker moved to Galveston County. There he earned a second term in Congress, serving from November 1838 through January 1839. The next Congress named Baker a brigadier general in the militia. He led a campaign against Indians along the Brazos River. Baker ran for a third term, to serve in the Sixth Congress, in 1841, but lost to Archibald Wynns by one vote. He was reappointed a brigadier general in 1842, following Mexican General Adrian Woll's invasion of B√©xar. Baker raised a company of men but fell ill and was forced to hand command to Gardiner Smith. Baker continued his feud with Houston, culminating in an 1844 open letter that named Houston \\"the greatest curse that Providence in its wrath could have sent upon the country.\\" Following the death of his wife, Baker became a Methodist preacher. He promoted his version of the religion through his own newspaper, True Evangelist. Although Methodist leaders, who disagreed with some of Baker's teachings, asked him to discontinue publishing the paper, Baker refused. Baker died of yellow fever on November 4, 1848 in Houston. His body was first laid to rest at Jefferson Davis Cemetery before being moved to the Episcopal Cemetery. In 1929, his remains were exhumed and reinterred at the Texas State Cemetery.

He wrote poems in Urdu and later in Balochi language. Shad is considered the architect of modern symbolic Balochi poetry. Career Shad started his career in Urdu poetry as a disciple of Faiz Ahmad Faiz but soon felt the need to evolve his own style. His unique style gave him a prominent place in the literary quarters . Atta Shad is considered a prominent figure of modern Balochi literature and was highly influenced by Western Romantic poets as Coleridge, Shelley, and T.S. Eliot. His first free verse poem named \\"Shepaank ÿ¥ŸæÿßŸÜ⁄© \\" was published in \\"Ols Magazine ŸÖÿß⁄æÿ™ÿß⁄© ÿßŸèŸÑÿ≥. Atta attracted widespread attention for his poem \\"Sah Kandan ÿ≥ÿß€Å ⁄©ŸÜÿØŸÜ \\" which represented the true sense of Baloch tradition and history. \\"In a broader sense, Atta truly served as a bridge between Urdu poetry and Balochi culture.\\" Early life Atta shad was born in Singani Sar, Kech District, near Turbat in November 1939. He served in several government positions as Information officer, Director General and Secretary Information. Literary contribution Urdu poetry During his lifetime, Atta published two collections of Urdu poetry. Atta's Urdu poetry is a true reflection of Balochi culture and landscape of Balochistan. He added a new poetic flavour to Urdu poetry by versifying certain Balochi folk lore, romantic sagas and maxims. He wrote poems like ‚ÄòMahnaaz‚Äô, ‚ÄòShah Mureed aur Haani‚Äô, ‚ÄòWafa‚Äô and ‚ÄòLori‚Äô. They represent different aspects of Balochi culture and talk about the psyche of the typical Baloch society. His short poem ‚ÄòWafa‚Äô (Oath of Allegiance) reads as: On my motherland A bowel of water Worth eternal allegiance Let us quench our thirst And Submit ourselves to the eternal bond. Balochi poetry During the time of Atta, Baloch poetry was divided into two major and often competing groups - Progressives and Purists. Atta Shad refused to join either group; he was neither convinced of bringing political change through poetry nor was he an advocate of purism. On the contrary, he conceived a poetic diction inclusive of words from all the dialects of Balochi, despite the fact that he was himself a speaker of the dominant Western Dialect.

Although it is sometimes considered to involve only the incidents of 3 March, the Devlin Commission report is clear that it was one of two distinct operations by the security forces, reinforced from outside Nyasaland, involving the arrest and detention members of the Nyasaland African Congress. It involved not only those members of Congress initially arrested, but others arrested and detained without trial in the course of the emergency.Simpson, p. 22 The operation was described in some detail in the Devlin Commission report (Colonial Office Report of the Nyasaland Commission of Inquiry, HMSO, London, 1959) and that account has been amplified by Colonial Office documents not made available to the Devlin Commission. Background There had been some sporadic unrest in Nyasaland in the early 1950s, most recently in 1953 when unrest among African tenants of the British Central Africa Company led to the \\"Cholo riots\\", and after Nyasaland was forced into the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Northern and Southern Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe, respectively) against the wishes of the Nyasaland people, by a campaign of non-violent resistance initiated by the Nyasaland African Congress (NAC).Pike, pp. 135‚Äì6 The Cholo riots were more serious: attempts by the British Central Africa Company to increase the rents of tenants, and evict those who resisted this, led to many local people in the Cholo (now Thyolo) District refusing to pay taxes or attend courts, and to riots breaking in August 1953, resulting in eleven dead and seventy-two injured.Palmer, pp. 122-3, 125 However the NAC campaign against Federation was abandoned in early 1954 and the party lost much of its supportPike, p. 137 and, following the Cholo riots, the Nyasaland government agreed to purchase land in Cholo District from the company for resettlement.Baker (1993), p. 217 The protectorate was relatively quiet until, in early 1957, the Nyasaland African Congress revived under a number of young activists, including Henry Chipembere, Kanyama Chiume and the brothers Dunduzu Chisiza and Yatuta Chisiza, who organised Congress as a mass political party and created support for Hastings Banda, a long-term expatriate who had campaigned against Federation, to return to Nyasaland as party leader.Rotberg, p. 287 The activities of these young activists as they toured the protectorate led to unrest including demonstrations and the intimidation of opponents.McCracken (2012), p. 345 On 6 July 1958, Hastings Banda returned to Nyasaland at the invitation of the activists to lead a movement against Federation and towards independence. Banda, together with some of these lieutenants, toured the country rousing support and the disturbances continued. At the end of 1958, Banda and other NAC leaders attended an All- African People‚Äôs Conference in Accra, in recently-independent Ghana, and they returned to Nyasaland determined to press for constitutional change.Rotberg, p. 287 When the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was set up in 1953, provision had been made for the Federal constitution to be reviewed in 1960, including a review of which territories it would include, and Banda wanted to ensure African, and hopefully Congress, majorities on the Nyasaland bodies that would take part in this review.Baker (2007), p. 28 However, when Banda presented the Congress proposals to the governor, Sir Robert Armitage that would have led to withdrawal from the Federation, Armitage refused to accept them, although Banda continued discussions with the governor and leading officials on proposed constitutional changes.Rotberg, p. 289 When talks ended in stalemate at the start of January 1959, Chipembere and Chiume led calls to intensify the protest campaign. Their programme proposed disobedience to colonial laws and demonstrations which would lead to arrests, to be followed by protests in favour of those arrested and further arrests of protesters, and the intimidation of, and sometimes assaults on, police and government workers trying to enforce the laws, in an escalatory cycle designed to cause chaosRotberg, p. 289. The disturbances particularly affected four heavily populated districts in the south of the protectorate, including the two largest towns and, by mid-February, Armitage considered that the situation was serious enough to prepare for a State of Emergency throughout Nyasaland.Baker (1997), p. 40 The authorities' concerns were bolstered by reports from several police informers, only one of which was actually present at the clandestine Congress meeting on the night of 24-25 January to discuss the possible action to be taken if Banda were arrested. It seems probable that this discussion including loose talk about attacking Europeans, and that this was the basis for the claim made by the Head of Special Branch of a plan for the indiscriminate killing of Europeans, Asians and Africans opposed to Congress, the so-called \\"murder plot\\".McCracken (2012), pp. 349-50 The Nyasaland government took no immediate action against Banda, and continued to negotiate with him, and the governor also made no specific reference to the \\"murder plot\\" until after his declaration of a State of Emergency.Devlin, pp. 74 et seqMcCracken (2012), pp. 351, 357 The Devlin Commission strongly criticised talk of the \\"murder plot\\", which it said did not exist, and the use made of this claim trying to justify the Emergency.McCracken (2012), pp. 356, 359Baker (2007), pp. 40‚Äì1 Armitage's preparations for a State of Emergency were made in February 1959, and included requests for police reinforcements from other British dependencies. He consulted the Federal Prime Minister Roy Welensky and the Southern Rhodesia Premier and, with the approval of the Colonial Office, over 1,000 troops were sent to Nyasaland from Southern Rhodesia, including European troops of the Royal Rhodesia Regiment and African troops of the Rhodesia African RiflesBaker (1998), p. 223. In the days immediately following, the arrival of Rhodesian troops police or troops opened fire on rioters in several places, leading to four deaths.Rotberg, pp. 296‚Äì7 The plans for Operation Sunrise, the first stage in the overall two-stage stabilisation operation, were prepared by the Nyasaland Operations Committee on 27 February 1959. Special Branch had been keeping lists of potential detainees since at least 1954, and the latest revision, made in November 1958, contained 617 names.Baker (1997), p. 8 A State of Emergency was declared at midnight on 2-3 March 1959. In a broadcast at 7am on 3 March the governor, Sir Robert Armitage, explained his decision as follows:Devlin, para 175, p. 87. The Operation Operation Sunrise was the first step taken after the declaration of the Emergency and was so named because its mission was to detain, at or just before dawn, 350 people who had been identified by police special branch as \\"hard core\\" or militant members of the native population. A quota of police and military personnel was designated for each province and district in the protectorate. Each of the 350 individual pick-up operations was to be made by a separate team consisting of about six men (which was taken by the Devlin Commission to mean that they were prepared for violence). The teams were also directed, of circumstances permitted, to search the detainee's house for documents.Devlin, paras 179, p.90 to 257, p. 128 Because of the potential for violence after the arrests, the authorities decided that most of the detainees should be imprisoned outside of Nyasaland. Accordingly, many detainees were taken immediately to temporary prisons erected at Chileka Airport in the south and Lilongwe Airport in the Central Province, in preparation for airlifting to Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia where they were to be interned in Khami Prison. In the Northern Province, there were ultimately 75 detainees, who were taken from Nkhata Bay on Lake Nyasa in the motor vessel m.v. Mpasa to Chipoka (although, because of unanticipated events, the vessel didn't arrive there until 6 March), whence they went by rail to Salima and by road to Lilongwe Airport (with the exception of 12 who were sent on by rail to Limbe). The procedure for the detention of Banda was more elaborate.Devlin, para 190, p. 94Baker (1996), pp. 1-14 The force consisted of six groups: A Police Mobile Force (PMF) platoon, a supporting platoon from the King's African Rifles, a diversion group under a police inspector, a \\"snatch party\\" of six men also under a police inspector, an escort group of three special constables (civilian volunteers), and a search group of two Special Branch (internal security) personnel. Banda's house was situated off the road between Limbe and Blantyre. At 4:35am, led by the diversion party, the Land Rovers coasted down hill towards the house with their lights extinguished.Baker (1997,) p.42 The diversion group arrived via the back roadway and rushed the servants' quarters at the back of the house in order to divert attention away from the main house. Having arrested the occupants they tear-gassed the interior to make sure there was nobody still hiding within. The PMF assault group, meanwhile, stormed the main house. There were about 60 men sleeping in the surrounding yard ‚Äì it had been anticipated for some time that Banda might be arrested ‚Äì who immediately fled, leaving behind an armory of two bows and arrows, four catapults (slingshots, in American parlance), one spear, twelve batons and knobkerries, three axes and some iron bars. Although the Banda supporters had apparently planned to beat a drum to alert the general populace ‚Äì who would relay the news with more drums ‚Äì in the event of his arrest, the drum was never beaten. The assault group tried to force the front door with an axe, to no effect. As it happened, the door was not locked. Banda's bodyguard, Yatuta Chisiza, who had been lying on a sofa in the front room, led the group to Banda's bedroom. Banda, in his pyjamas, was allowed to put on a dressing gown (housecoat) and taken to a waiting Land Rover. He was also permitted to take a suit of clothes (but not, by some oversight, underwear). He was driven immediately to Chileka Airport, barely avoiding a potentially fatal collision with an oncoming Saracen armored vehicle on the narrow road, and shortly afterwards flown to Gwelo (now Gweru) in Southern Rhodesia with one of his lieutenants, Henry Chipembere who had been detained by chance on the Chileka Airport road. The numbers detained in Operation Sunrise on the 3 March 1959 were 22 dissidents by 6am, 60 dissidents by 10am, 90 dissidents by 1:30pm, and 120 dissidents by 5pm. By 9pm on the following day, 4 March, 130 dissidents had been arrested and 44 dissidents more detained on \\"28-day orders\\" (limited- duration detention/review). By 5 March, 263 dissidents had been arrested, some having given themselves up voluntarily, with a further 87 dissidents on the list remaining at large. Some of the detainees were released immediately. All but a few high-level remaining were first detained at Khami. Banda, Chipembere, F.W.K. (Kaphombe) Nyasulu, and Dunduzu Chisiza were interned at Gwelo (later to be joined by Dunduzu's brother, Yatuta, who was initially sent to Khami). Further arrests took place during the course of the emergency, and by 18 July there were 381 dissidents held in Nyasaland, and 125 dissidents in Southern Rhodesia, as well as 18 persons held under 28-day orders: by then, 1,163 detention orders in total had been made. By 1 November 1959 the number had risen to 1,328. Many of the detainees were soon released; by 1 November 1959, 830 dissidents had been released.Simpson, pp. 22- 3 Although most of the arrests were carried out without lethal force or excessive violence, five injuries in cases where resistance was allegedly offered. More significantly, in two incidents involving demonstrations by crowds against the arrests, at least 21 people were killed and 29 injured.Baker (1997), p 50 Of those killed, 20 were demonstrators at Nkhata Bay, where those detained in the Northern Region were being held before being transferred by steamer to the south. A local Congress leader who had not been arrested encouraged a large crowd to gather at the dockside, apparently to secure the release of the detainees. Only a few troops had arrived by ship, as those who should have arrived by road early on 3 March were delayed. Before these arrived, the District Commissioner felt the situation was beyond the control of the few soldiers available, and he ordered then to open fire when the crowd refused to disperse after he had declared a riot. The other death the occurred on 3 March was in Blantyre.Baker (1997), pp. 48‚Äì51 Operation Sunrise was the first stage of Armitage's plan for the Emergency, to be followed by rounding up and detaining of any Congress leaders still at large.Baker (1997), p. 60 Those detainees who had been wrongly detained or were minor Congress members who Armitage considered had not engaged in violence were to be released swiftly, although he generally showed reluctance to release more prominent leaders. However, the 225 detainees released in March 1959 and 275 in April included many detained after the first days of Operation Sunrise, an indication of how far Armitage's aim of returning to normal quickly had not been realised.Baker (1997), p. 70 The Nkhata Bay shootings The town of Nkhata Bay was, and still is, a district headquarters. The District Commissioner in 1959, John Brock, believed that, by the standards of the time, he enjoyed good relations with the local people, which he was unwilling to jeopardise by bringing in troops earlier than he thought necessary.Baker (1997), p. 51 However, he had received secret instructions that Operation Sunrise on 3 March would involve the arrest of detainees from his district at dawn and their lodgement in the town prison until a motor vessel, M.V. Mpasa, arrived at 6.30 am. Those detainees were to be sent on board under guard, the Mpasa was to sail on to Karonga at the northern end of the lake to receive detainees from that district, before returning to Nkhata Bay to pick up a further group of detainees, arrested at dawn in Mzimba district, and brought by road from Mzimba town, about 120 miles from Nkhata Bay. The ship would then take all those arrested to the railway terminus at Chipoka, further south on the lake.Baker (1997), p. 48Ransford, p. 274 The District Commissioner subsequently told the Devlin Commission that he had been advised of the \\"murder plot\\" and, although Brock thought it was only a wild idea,Brock, p. 14 he took action to protect the local European residents in Nkhata Bay. This was the one clear example that rumours of this plot had an effect on events.Baker (1997), pp. 41, 115 The small local police force had already been reinforced by a police Inspector and 14 constables, and by 11 soldiers of the Kings African Rifles (KAR) but, anticipating trouble when the Operation Sunrise arrests were made, the Major in charge of the army base at Mzimba had been ordered to leave there at 1am with two platoons of white soldiers of the Royal Rhodesia Regiment (RRR), to arrive at Nkhata Bay around 9am. However, his men had only reached Mzimba late the previous day, so he delayed their departureBrock, p. 15 In addition, a sergeant and 11 privates from the RRR were on board the MpasaRansford, p. 274 At around 6.30 am, the Mpasa arrived and the prisoners that had already been detained were taken to the dock area. The fenced dock area included a wharf and floating jetty where vessels tied-up, with a narrow approach road, widening near the wharf.Ransford, p. 273 A crowd began to gather at the prison, and a local Congress leader who had not been arrested, encouraged them to attempt to secure the release of the detainees,Baker (1997), p. 50 unaware that they were already on the Mpasa.Ransford, p. 274 The Royal Rhodesia Regiment sergeant, van Oppen, decided to send six of his men ashore to reinforce the police and KAR at the prison. The District Commissioner attempted to get the crowd to disperse, telling them of the State of Emergency, and when that failed, tried to establish by telephone when the troops from Mzimba would arrive.Brock, p. 15 By 8.30 am they had not even reached Mzuzu, about 50 miles from Nkhata Bay, and did not arrive until 3 pm in the afternoonRansford, p. 275 A small detachment of KAR soldiers at Mzuzu was therefore immediately sent to Nkhata Bay, and it arrived about noon. Brock, the District Commissioner, was left in the very difficult position of controlling a large, angry crowd with few police and troops on hand, with adequate reinforcements a significant distance away.Baker (1997), p. 50 Once the crowd realised that the prisoners were on the Mpasa, it went toward the dock area. The police, KAR soldiers and the six RRR privates at the prison were thereafter left in peace. The District Commissioner had tried to order the Mpasa to leave, but was either prevented by the crowd from doing so,Baker (1997), p. 123 or by the RRR sergeant on board, who refused to leave six of his men behind.Ransford, p. 276 Leaving one soldier on board, his remaining four soldiers with fixed bayonets on their rifles and van Oppen with a Sten gun at first held the entrance to the dock area against about a thousand men and women. Sergeant van Oppen was subsequently awarded the British Empire Medal on the recommendation of Roy Welensky, the Federal Prime Minister.Baker (1997), p. 259Ransford, p. 274 The crowd was unarmed but hostile and pressed against the five soldiers, slowly forcing them back along the narrow road toward the ship for almost two hours.Ransford, p. 276 The troops were not physically assaulted and the District Commissioner managed to join them, but there was much jeering and spitting. Initially, the District Commissioner refused the RRR sergeant‚Äôs plea to disperse the crowd by firing limited number of shots at them,Brock, p. 17 as his aim was to avoid bloodshed until the promised reinforcements arrived.Baker (1997), p. 41 By about 11.30 am, when no further troops had arrived, and the five soldiers had retreated to a point beyond which they could be easily surrounded, he read the Riot ActBrock, p. 17 and, when the crowd did not disperse, handed over his powers to the military. After twice pointing their rifles at the crowd without firing, the five soldiers including the sergeant opened fire on the crowd, and were recorded as killing or fatally wounding 20 protesters and injuring at least 28 more.Baker (1997), p. 115Ransford, p. 277 According to the Devlin Report, a total of 27 shots was fired, 18 from the soldier‚Äôs rifles and 9 from the sergeant‚Äôs Sten gunBrock, p. 17. Subsequent enquiries established that eight of those initially recorded as wounded but not fatally so later died of their wounds.McCracken (2012), p. 354 The confrontation and shooting was already over by noon when the KAR soldiers from Mzuzu arrived.Ransford, p. 277 Although Alan Lennox-Boyd, the Colonial Secretary, argued in Cabinet that it might have been possible to fire over the heads of the crowd in the first instance to avoid casualties, and although the Devlin thought that the deaths could have been avoided, had the Mpasa sailed as soon as the crowd were seen to approach the dock area,Baker (1997), pp. 115-17, the Commission accepted that the District commissioner had the legal authority to order the soldiers to open fire, and that in retrospect it was the correct and the only thing to do when facing off against such a hostile crowd.Baker (1997), pp. 117, 165 Aftermath The Nyasaland government directed two operations against what had been, until just after midnight on 2 March, a lawful political party with whose leader, Dr Banda, the government had been negotiating. Both operations produced hostile and sometimes violent reactions.Simpson, p. 23. The initial reaction of many Congress supporters to Operation Sunrise was rioting, damage to government and European property and strikes, and there were five more deaths in Machinga District up to 19 March when soldiers of the Royal Rhodesia Regiment or Kings African Rifles were ordered to open fire on rioters.Baker, (1997), pp. 50‚Äì1 However, after a short period, following action by the police and troops, the Southern Region was calm but tense and the strikers returned to work.McCracken (2012), p. 355 There were another further six deaths of rioters shot in the Northern Region in March.Baker, (1997), pp. 48‚Äì9 The Nyasaland Police, which participated in Operation Sunrise, particularly the paramilitary Police Mobile Force, were routinely armed and lived segregated lives in the police lines, alien to most other Africans.McCracken (1992), p. 180 In the Northern Region, the destruction of bridges and government buildings and rural resistance, including attacks on conservation schemes, continued for several months, particularly in the Misuku Hills, a remote area of rural Congress radicalism close to the border with Tanganyika TerritoryMcCracken (2012), pp. 355‚Äì6. and the remainder of the 51 officially recorded deaths were in military operations in the Northern Region.Baker (1997), p. 61Rotberg, p. 299 These deaths occurred in the second operation, which had no code name, and involved what the governor described as a \\"campaign of harassment\\" involving \\"tough and punitive\\" operations by the military in disaffected areas, to restore governmental authority. Soldiers rather than police conducted these operations, which were reinforced by the imposition of collective fines, and by arrests of suspected members of Congress under 28 day orders or under normal police powers, and their being charged with criminal offences. By 1 November 1959, 1,040 had been convicted of criminal offences and 840 acquitted. Simpson, p. 24. Allegations of brutality were later considered by the Devlin Commission. It rejected claim of rape and torture made against Federation troops in the Misuku Hills, but it upheld other complaints, including the burning of houses, the imposition of arbitrary fines and beatings, which it considered illegal.McCracken (2012), p. 360Simpson, p. 24. Operation Sunrise was the first stage of Armitage's plan for the Emergency. His plan for the next stage envisaged encouraging moderate, non-Congress, African leaders to come forward, issuing pro-government, anti-Congress propaganda and making what he hoped would be firm but friendly displays of police and military force. Once a firm military presence had demonstrated the futility of resistance, he considered that troops from the Rhodesias could be withdrawn by stages.Baker (1997), pp. 60, 63 Those detainees who had been wrongly detained or were minor Congress members who had not engaged in violence could be released swiftly, although many more continued to be detained well after the start Operation Sunrise.Baker (1997), p. 70 Armitage had no plans to resolve the political crisis in Nyasaland, other than the elimination of Banda and Congress and, from March 1959 he repeatedly sought Colonial Office approval to introduce legislation either to ban Banda from returning to Nyasaland after his detention or to extend his detention (in Rhodesia or Nyasaland) indefinitely. He was also unwilling to release most of the detainees. Those African politicians that had put themselves forward as moderate alternatives to Banda were, Armitage admitted, not credible and without influence.McCracken, (2012). pp. 360-1 Armitage hoped that Orton Chirwa, who had been released from detention in August and became first president of the Malawi Congress Party, the successor to the banned Nyasaland African Congress, would be willing to negotiate, but Chirwa said that only Banda had the authority to do so.McCracken, (2012). pp. 360-1, 363 By December 1959, the new Colonial Secretary, Iain Macleod, insisted that the vast majority of detainees should be released quickly, including Banda but not Chipembere, Chiume or the Chisiza brothers and others labelled as extremists.McCracken (2012), pp. 363-4, 367 Armitage was generally resistant to releasing detainees to reduce numbers, and his cautious insistence on a detailed review of each case and saying in July 1959 he could not envisage releasing a hard core of 49 detainees caused tension with Macleod.Baker (1997), p. 211 In January 1960, Armitage also asked for extra troops to be sent from Southern Rhodesia when Banda was due to be released, reinforcements that Macleod declined to authorise.Baker (1997), p. 218. Banda was released on 1 February 1960 and the State of Emergency ended on 16 June 1960. Armitage was by now discredited and was seen by Macleod, who had instructed him in May 1960 to arrange for rapid constitutional advancement as an obstacle to progress.Baker (1998), p. 248, In August 1960, Macleod advised Armitage to go on leave pending his retirement, and he retired in April 1961 without returning to Nyasaland.Baker (1998), pp. 265-7 During the 16 months of the State of Emergency, up to 4,500 police and soldiers, the majority not from Nyasaland, patrolled the protectorate. In all, 1,339 people were detailed without trial and 2,160 were convicted.McCracken (1992), pp. 178-9 .

Common in film since the 1980s, the jump scare has been described as \\"one of the most basic building blocks of horror movies\\". Jump scares can surprise the viewer by appearing at a point in the film where the soundtrack is quiet and the viewer is not expecting anything alarming to happen, or can be the sudden payoff to a long period of suspense. Some critics have described jump scares as a lazy way to frighten viewers, and believe that the horror genre has undergone a decline in recent years following an over-reliance on the trope, establishing it as a clich√© of modern horror films.  In film  Prior to the 1980s, jump scares were a relatively rare occurrence in horror movies. However, they became increasingly common in the early 80s as the slasher subgenre increased in popularity. One of the earliest jump scares was used in The Phantom of the Opera (1925), when Christine removes The Phantom's mask. However, silent films did not really lend themselves to the technique. The first significant jump scare from the sound era is from Cat People (1942), as Alice is being chased down an alley and a bus suddenly appears at the end of the alley, accompanied by a loud hiss and screech; this technique of a jump scare from an object that‚Äôs actually non-threatening became known as ‚Äúthe Lewton Bus,‚Äù after the film‚Äôs producer Val Lewton. One of the most significant and impressive jump scares of the black and white era was from Howard Hawks' The Thing from Another World (1951), when the creature attacks immediately upon the characters opening a closed door. 1976's Carrie has one of the first modern jump scares. The scene, which occurs at the end of the film, is credited as the inspiration for the use of a final jump scare in the 1980 movie Friday the 13th, to show that an apparently dead villain had survived. The 1979 film When a Stranger Calls uses a form of jump scare to suddenly reveal the location of the antagonist to both the protagonist and the audience. Film writer William Cheng describes this as causing a \\"sudden vanishing of the protective walls surrounding the film's protagonist\\", in turn giving the viewer at home a sense that the intruder is also somehow closer to them. The jump scare from the 1990 film The Exorcist III is considered by horror fans (in a 2017 article on a Reddit thread) to be the most famous and scariest jump scare in movie history. In the scene, a nurse enters a room in a hall, while a guard walks by in the background. As soon as she exits the room, locks it and begins to leave, the camera quickly zooms in, and a figure clad in white and wielding large scissors suddenly walks out of the room and kills her offscreen, along with loud chord music. The 2009 film Drag Me to Hell contains jump scares throughout. Director Sam Raimi said he wanted to create a horror film with \\"big shocks that‚Äôll hopefully make audiences jump.\\"  In video games  Rescue on Fractalus! may be the first video game to use a jump scare. In this first-person fly-through game, the navigator attempts to find and land to pickup other downed pilots. Some of the pilots are aliens in disguise, who would suddenly jump into view, roaring and trying to smash into the cockpit. Resident Evil is cited as the first modern video game to use jump scares. The player, during the course of the game, walks through a hallway where the music begins to lower. About halfway through the hall, zombie dogs will suddenly leap through the windows and the music will peak in volume and intensity. The video game Daylight was described as being a \\"vehicle for jump scares\\", and though reviewers praised its successful use of jump scares, they commented that as the game wore on jump scares alone weren't a sufficient tool for scaring players. The video game series Five Nights at Freddy's was described as \\"perfect for live streaming\\" in part due to its use of jump scares throughout the games. The exercise video game Wii Fit Plus contains a game called Lotus Focus (Zazen on European releases), in which the player must sit still with their back straight and focus on a candle until it burns all the way down (which takes no more than 180 seconds). The player will occasionally hear strange sounds that will try to distract them. The score is how long the player can keep the candle lit. If the player moves too much (almost even in the slightest), a large, white Zainab will abruptly flash on the screen, accompanied by a loud voice shouting \\"KATSU!!\\", which will end the game. Super Mario Party uses jumpscares in Don't Wake Wiggler!, a 4-player minigame. In the minigame, players must carefully and slowly move their Joy- Con from left to right to pet a sleeping Wiggler without waking it up. Turn by turn, a player wins points each time the Wiggler is pet. However, at a random point, the Wiggler abruptly wakes up in anger, causing the player who wakes it up to lose all the points they have achieved.  Internet screamers  An Internet screamer, or simply screamer, is a video or game on the Internet that has a sudden change designed to jumpscare the user. Screamers have been popular since at least 1996 with some of the best known appearing at that time. One of the most famous examples of an Internet screamer is The Scary Maze Game created in 2004 made by game developer Jeremy Winterrowd. Disguised as a computer game, the player is supposed to use the mouse to move into a red square along a given path without touching the walls. As the player progresses, the walls get closer together, making it more difficult for the player to avoid touching the walls. At first, if the player accidentally touches the wall it will lead back to the start menu and the player has to start over, but once the player reaches level 3, the walls become so close together that it becomes very difficult to avoid touching them. When the player reaches a certain point near the end of the maze, regardless of whether the wall is touched or not, a picture of Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) from The Exorcist appears with two extremely loud screams. YouTube prohibits screamers in video advertising. In August 2018, a video marketing The Nun depicted the iOS device volume icon muting, and the titular character appears with an incredibly loud scream. The ad was removed shortly afterward for violating the site's \\"shocking content policy\\".

His acting life began on Broadway in the first decade of the 1900s, when he appeared in the Broadway play, Her Majesty, the Girl Queen of Nordenmark, which ran at the Manhattan Theatre in 1900. In 1906, he married famous stage actress Mrs. Leslie Carter, fifteen years her junior, and remained married to her until her death in 1937. He made his film debut in 1915's DuBarry, a film created to highlight Carter, who was a prot√©g√© of the playwright David Belasco. Belasco wrote the stage play of the same name on which the film is based, and in which Carter starred on Broadway. Payne appeared in over 40 films during his 35-year career in Hollywood, as well as doing numerous plays. In 1940, three years after Carter's death, Warner Bros. produced a biopic on her life, Lady with Red Hair, on which Payne serves as a technical advisor. He continued to act in small roles through the 1940s. The final film in which Payne appeared was 1951's epic Quo Vadis, starring Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr, in which he played one of Jesus' 12 apostles. Payne died on August 14, 1953, at the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, California. He was buried with his wife at Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum in Dayton, Ohio.

Ury founded and served as the director of the Harvard Nuclear Negotiation Project. In 1982, the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency requested that the Harvard Negotiation Project compile a report applying its understanding of human communication to the issue of superpower restraint in order to reduce the risk of a war started by accident, terrorism, mistake, runaway escalation, or misperception. Together with Richard Smoke, Ury interviewed U.S. and Soviet specialists and government officials, and published the report for the government in 1984. The report was the basis for Ury's book Beyond the Hotline. During this time, he also acted as a consultant to the Crisis Management Center at the White House, working to create Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in Washington and Moscow, which were the subject of the first arms control agreement signed by President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.

The International Negotiation Network was led by a council that included Carter and Desmond Tutu. Other notable people involved with the Network include Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar, Sonny Ramphal, and Sir Brian Urquhart. Ury teaches negotiation to international corporate executives and labor leaders in order to reach mutually profitable agreements with customers, suppliers, unions and joint-venture partners. In 2001, Ury co-founded the e-Parliament with Nicholas Dunlop. The website serves as a global forum for international elected officials to work on issues of common interest. The e-Parliament has given birth to the Climate Parliament, which links thousands of elected officials from 50 different countries to work together informally on issues of renewable energy and climate. Abraham Path In 2007, Ury founded the Abraham Path Initiative, a long-distance walking trail across the Middle East which connects the sites visited by Abraham as recorded in ancient religious texts and traditions. The Abraham Path Initiative was incubated at the Harvard Negotiation Project and is endorsed by the United Nations World Tourism Organization, the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and other international partners. The non-profit, non-religious and non-political initiative aims to support local partners in developing the Abraham Path as: In April 2014, the Abraham Path was listed in National Geographic Traveler (UK) magazine as number one on its list of the ten best walking trails in the world.

Berg exposing child sexual abuse in the film industry in California. Production history Berg decided to make the documentary after she was approached by Matthew Valentinas in 2011. Valentinas and Gabe Hoffman wanted to make a film about victims of sexual exploitation. Valentinas said, \\"We chose Amy because we didn't want it to be exploitative or tabloid. We wanted it to be empowering for the victims.\\" Matthew Valentinas, an entertainment lawyer, came up with the idea when he heard Corey Feldman talking about his sexual abuse as a child actor in a TV interview. Berg's 2006 film Deliver Us from Evil, a documentary on systemic child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, had been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Synopsis The documentary follows the stories of five former child actors who were sexually abused by multiple predators. Much of the film focuses on Marc Collins-Rector, subsequently convicted of child sexual abuse, who co-owned and operated Digital Entertainment Network. DEN produced brief online videos during the early days of the Internet, and was noted for wild parties featuring underaged boys at Collins-Rector's house. The film makes multiple references to director Bryan Singer, who was allegedly at some of the DEN parties, but does not detail allegations against him. A lawsuit alleging that Singer sexually abused Michael Egan as an underage boy was withdrawn during the production of the film. As a result, the film only details allegations made by persons willing to appear on camera. Among the persons interviewed is Vanity Fair journalist John Connolly, who states that an article on pedophilia in Hollywood was dropped at the last minute by Details magazine. Reception An Open Secret has an approval rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews from 17 critics. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on reviews from 9 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film offered a \\"sober look at accusations that lend themselves to sensationalism.\\" The Los Angeles Times describes the movie as \\"not the hard-hitting expos√© that it aims to be\\" but as \\"an unsettling look at pedophilia in Hollywood\\". The New York Times wrote that the \\"topic deserves a tenacious call for answers\\" and hoped for \\"further aggressive reporting\\" which they missed in the movie, when Berg linked Martin Weiss \\"to a string of other men\\" but only presenting \\"a secretly taped conversation and some menacing music\\". Flavorwire claims that \\"the film feels less shocking as a cult-of-celebrity document and more just quietly horrifying, as it details the trauma and the abuse of power inflicted on young men with stars in their eyes.\\" Indiewire described the documentary as \\"an incisive and utterly unflinching look at a subject too rarely scrutinized.\\" Controversy On July 30, 2015, Deadline Hollywood reported that the movie producers had accused Amy Berg of not supporting the documentary. Producers Gabe Hoffman and Matthew Valentinas filed an arbitration against the movie's director Amy Berg for allegedly delivering the movie late and incomplete, and failing to promote it. Hoffman's Esponda Productions claimed that Berg failed to get the proper release forms from some of the interviewees and that this error almost caused the film to miss its premiere at Doc NYC. Another controversy arose when HuffPost reported that the movie's subjects Evan Henzi and Chris Turcotte had called the documentary \\"unfair\\" and \\"dishonest\\". On another Huffington Post article, Turcotte explained that Amy Berg omitted portions of his interview from the movie, detailing that Collins-Rector had sex at the estate with underage teens in private but not as part of sex parties. The movie controversy appears to be substantiated in Michael Egan's teen sex abuse claims against Bryan Singer and three others. \\"His cases against the four men began to collapse in May 2014, just a month after they were filed, when his prior contradictory statements came to light\\". Egan's attorneys Jeff Herman and Mark Gallagher later settled with Garth Ancier and David Neuman and issued an apology that called the allegations \\"untrue\\" and paid a seven-figure settlement to both. Gary Goddard and Bryan Singer didn't receive an apology because they didn't file countersuits like Ancier and Neuman, although \\"Egan‚Äôs cases against all four were framed in virtually identical complaints and centered on the same purported events, timeframes, locations and supposed trip(s) to Hawaii\\". The documentary previously named all four men in connection with the 2014 suits was edited to remove those references. Release An Open Secret initially had a limited theatrical release, but producers were encouraged about its commercial potential because a pirated version was viewed 900,000 times. However, it received no television deal or video-on-demand distribution. According to Gabe Hoffman, who financed the film: \\"We got zero Hollywood offers to distribute the film. Not even one. Literally no offers for any price whatsoever.\\" On October 12, 2017, Hoffman and Valentinas released the film for nine days on Vimeo \\"to commemorate serial predator Harvey Weinstein finally being exposed.\\" It went viral, and free viewing was then extended for a longer period due to the interest shown in the film, with over 3 million viewings garnered on various social media platforms in the first two weeks. At the time of its Vimeo release, the producers said they were seeking further distribution of the documentary. It has not been released to home video.An Open Secret, Official PG-13 version (uploaded to Vimeo on 2015Oct14) References External links  * Category:2014 films Category:English-language films Category:2014 documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:Child sexual abuse in the United States Category:Documentary films about pedophilia Category:Documentary films about child abuse Category:Documentary films about Hollywood Category:Documentary films about crime in the United States Category:Films directed by Amy J.

The second story retains the Romanesque arches and decorated lintels, which are supported by colonnettes. Each colonnette has a lion's head, reminiscent of the carved figureheads which adorned the prows of old seagoing vessels. At the time of the NRHP inventory, the ground floor was divided into two large rooms, which were occupied by the Elwell Auto Supply store. The upper floor is divided into several rooms, which the Triton Life Insurance Company used as offices. They have been vacant since Triton moved out in 1974. A large map of Oklahoma decorates the building's outer wall.

It was in development from 1946 to 1957, but probably no prototypes were produced or tested. The Triton program was approved in September 1946, designated SSM-2 a year later, and redesignated SSM-N-2 in early 1948. A preliminary design was produced by 1950 as the XSSM-N-2, but was scaled down by 1955 and redesigned again in 1957. Triton was cancelled in 1957, probably as a result of the 1956 decision to focus the Navy's strategic weapons development on the Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile.Friedman Submarines, p. 195 In any case, prototypes of the similar Regulus II missile had already flown, and Triton was redundant, offering only an increase in range from to , which Polaris was about to achieve along with many other advantages. Regulus II was itself cancelled in 1958, although testing of missiles already built continued for several years. Development history Triton was approved by the US Navy in 1946 and a preliminary design was ready by 1950. The goal was to produce a supersonic land-attack nuclear cruise missile capable of being launched from the same platforms and equipment as the subsonic SSM-N-8 Regulus I, which were surface combatants, submarines, and aircraft carriers via launch rails or catapults. One reference cites Triton as an outgrowth of Operation Bumblebee, which produced the Navy's first production surface-to-air missiles, notably Talos, which had a ramjet sustainer like Triton.Friedman Submarines, p. 263 An artist‚Äôs concept shows the first iteration of Triton with a long ramjet body, two mid-body stub wings, and four solid-fuel boosters clustered around a relatively large cruciform tail. The specifications were a missile with a range of at Mach 2.0 and a nuclear payload of . Since Regulus I weighed under , it's difficult to see how this version of Triton would be usable by the initial Regulus platforms. Even Regulus II, which occupied about twice the volume of Regulus I, weighed only . A slimmer design for Triton was produced in 1955, at with a range of and a nuclear payload of (nuclear warheads were rapidly getting smaller). This design was approved for further development, with initial operational capability expected by 1965. A 1957 redesign is described in the infobox, apparently a re-expansion to to achieve a range and a perhaps unrealistic speed of Mach 3.5. Triton was cancelled that same year in favor of Polaris, which proved to be a wildly successful system despite being produced on a \\"crash\\" timeline. At a cost of $19.4 million in 1953 dollars, Triton was a somewhat expensive failure. However, in 1950 it could not be foreseen that the turbojet-powered, supersonic Regulus II would be comparable to a ramjet-powered weapon in just six years, or that a solid- fueled ballistic missile (Polaris) would soon eclipse all of the Navy‚Äôs other strategic options, and that it could be developed and deployed by 1961. Possible platforms Sketch designs were prepared for surface ships and submarines to carry Triton. A submarine capable of carrying four Triton or Regulus II missiles or up to eight Regulus I missiles was sketched in 1956.Friedman Submarines, p. 183 One of the many proposals for modernizing the Iowa-class battleships came in 1955, featuring Talos surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and one or two launchers for Regulus or Triton. The incomplete was proposed for completion to this design.Friedman Battleships, pp. 398-399Scarpaci, p. 4 Another incomplete ship, the large cruiser , was also proposed for various conversions, including a 1947 sketch with 12 launchers for copies of the V-2 short-range ballistic missile and six Triton launchers (though one reference states these launchers were for Operation Bumblebee's developmental XPM (Experimental Prototype Missile) SAM).Scarpaci, p. 19Friedman Cruisers, pp. 373-377 References Bibliography   * SSM-N-2 Triton on Italian Wikipedia Further reading   Category:Nuclear cruise missiles of the United States Category:Nuclear cruise missiles of the United States Navy Category:Cruise missiles of the Cold War Category:Cold War nuclear missiles of the United States Category:Abandoned military rocket and missile projects of the United States ","title":"SSM-N-2 Triton"},{"id":"44820274","text":"Trigonopterus alaspurwensis is a species of flightless weevil in the genus Trigonopterus from Indonesia.

The villa underwent Neoclassic style reconstruction in the end of the 18th and start of the 19th century by the architect Simone Cantoni. The facade was added a large clock face. The surrounding gardens were arrayed in parterres, and contained a Nymphaeum of Neptune (1720‚Äì1721) with a waterfall fountain. The latter was admired by the French scholar Montesquieu in 1728.Museo del Territorio Vimercatese. The interior was decorated with various frescoes from the 17th century, including a Hall of Alexander the Great with frescoed scenes depicting: Alexander tames Bucephalus; Alexander and the Gordian Knot, Alexander wounded at Tarsus, Alexander at Issus.

Biography Yuri Ivask was born in Moscow, son of Pavel Ivask, a merchant of Estonian origins, and his Russian wife. In 1920 the family moved to Estonia where Ivask enrolled into the Tartu University, which he graduated in 1932. In 1943 he was mobilized into the German army but has never made it to the front due to poor health. In 1944, anticipating the advance of the Red Army, he fled to Germany and in 1946 joined there the Hamburg University to study Slavistics and philosophy. In 1949 he moved to the USA where he earned his Ph.D. in Slavic languages and literatures at the Harvard University. In 1955 Ivask received the American citizenship. In 1969-1977 he taught in the Kansas, Indiana and Washington Universities, then became the head of the Russian literature department in the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. George Ivask (as he was known in the US) retired in 1977. Career Yuri Ivask started publishing poetry in 1929, occasionally using pseudonyms (B. Afanasyevsky, G. Issako, A.B.), mostly in Put, a magazine founded by Nikolai Berdyaev, who exerted a major influence upon him, as well as Georgy Fedotov. Ivask's first book Severny Bereg (The Northern Shore) came out in 1938 in Warsaw. He characterized his style as 'neo-barocco', while considering himself a follower of Gavriil Derzhavin. Arguably his best-remembered work is Homo Ludens (–ò–≥—Ä–∞—é—â–∏–π —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫, 1973), a free-montage autobiography in verse which remained unfinished. Ivask compiled and edited In the West (–ù–∞ –ó–∞–ø–∞–¥–µ, New York, 1953), an extensive anthology of the poets of the first and the second waves of Russian emigration, published books by Georgy Fedotov and Vasily Rozanov, as well as critical essays and Konstantin Leontyev (1974), a monograph upon the controversial Russian religious thinker.

In the BBC's Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, the Grandfather is a corrupt future version of the Eighth Doctor, while in Lawrence Miles's Faction Paradox series he is a seemingly incorporeal Time Lord of unknown identity. Both narratives portray him as the founder of Faction Paradox, a time-travelling voodoo cult. Fictional character biography Doctor Who In Lawrence Miles's Christmas on a Rational Planet, the Grandfather is referred to as the \\"voodoo priest of the House of Lungbarrow\\", suggesting he may have originated in the Doctor's own family. In Lance Parkin's The Gallifrey Chronicles, the Doctor recalls his childhood, when his mother read him an ancient Gallifreyan legend about an adventurous youth. Ignoring his elders' warnings, the youth travelled into his own past and ‚Äì with no clear motivation ‚Äì murdered his own grandfather with an ordinary knife. The murder prevented the youth's birth, which prevented the murder, creating an irresolvable paradox. The youth was never heard from again, but legends said that he existed on some level as a being named Grandfather Paradox, a \\"shadowy half-man, simultaneously alive and dead, murderer and victim\\", always plotting against the Time Lords. The Grandfather is the founder and leader of Faction Paradox, a time-travelling voodoo cult. Rejecting the ethos of Time Lord society, Faction Paradox members enjoy interfering with time travel and causing havoc and paradoxes. Their ritualistic practises and use of death imagery is a repudiation of the Time Lords' immortality. Rather than reproduce, Faction Paradox prefer to recruit outcasts, both from the Time Lords and lesser races such as humans. At some point, Grandfather Paradox is captured by the Time Lords. They imprison him in Shada, their prison asteroid, declining to execute him because they fear him dead more than alive. In Christmas on a Rational Planet, the Carnival Queen disrupts the universe's rationality; this causes Lady President Romana to suffer an epileptic fit in which she signs an order to release 300 prisoners. Grandfather Paradox leads the mass escape from Shada. In Alien Bodies, the Grandfather sends two Faction Paradox representatives ‚Äì Cousin Justine and Little Brother Manjuele ‚Äì to an auction to bid for the body of the Doctor, who has been killed in a future War between the Time Lords, Faction Paradox and an unknown Enemy. The Grandfather plans to obtain the future Doctor's biodata and grow from its strength, but this is prevented by the Eighth Doctor, who destroys the body to prevent it from being used as a weapon. In the same book, the Doctor speculates that, like the Celestial Intervention Agency, the Grandfather has erased himself from history to become a being of pure concept. The character makes his only direct appearance in The Ancestor Cell, where he is revealed to be a future Eighth Doctor, corrupted by Faction Paradox's biodata virus. The Grandfather takes command of Faction Paradox, planning to lead them to victory in the War and conquer both the Time Lords and the Enemy. The Doctor destabilises the TARDIS, which has been drawing energy from a bottle universe to contain the corrupt timeline where the virus infected him. The energy released erases Faction Paradox and the Grandfather from existence, at the cost of destroying Gallifrey. This sequence is revisited in a flashback in The Gallifrey Chronicles, which states that the Grandfather is the Doctor from 292 years into the future. The novel also states that the Grandfather is not just the Doctor's future self, but everyone's: > \\"This was what you became if you didn't mend your ways. Anyone looking him > in the eye would see themselves staring back. Consumed not with anything as > lurid as evil, but with cynicism masquerading as cleverness. Self-absorption > and pettiness, pragmatism and grudges, boredom and sadness. He is the person > you vow you'll never become as an adventurous youth, and he‚Äôs always > watching you, ready to strike.\\" Faction Paradox In The Faction Paradox Protocols audio series, it is revealed that Faction Paradox still possess the knife with which the Grandfather cut off his arm. The knife is stained with the Grandfather's dried blood ‚Äì all that remains of him in the physical universe ‚Äì and has become imbued with his \\"shadow\\". Faction Paradox members traditionally bond their chosen weapons to their shadows, allowing them to draw at any time and strike enemies without physically moving. After losing her shadow in an accident, Cousin Justine takes the Grandfather's knife and is bonded to his one-armed shadow, allowing her to access his seemingly infinite weapons instantly. Justine is later convicted by the Great Houses, as Faction Paradox custom dictates that she is now legally the Grandfather and therefore responsible for his crimes. She eventually escapes their prison asteroid, but begins to wonder if the Grandfather's shadow is driving her mad. The Grandfather is revered in the Eleven-Day Empire, a version of London created when Faction Paradox purchased eleven days from the British government at the enactment of the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750. A statue of the Grandfather stands atop their version of Nelson's Column, and the speaker's chair in their version of the Palace of Westminster is always left empty, awaiting the Grandfather's return. Appearance The legends agree that Grandfather Paradox has only one arm, but which arm he lost and how he lost it are disputed. In The Ancestor Cell, the Grandfather claims that he cut it off to remove the criminal branding applied by the Time Lords after he committed atrocities against reality which he can no longer remember. At the novel's climax, the Eighth Doctor tells the Grandfather that he removed it because it was the arm with which he had destroyed Gallifrey. In The Ancestor Cell, the Grandfather appears as an older, emaciated, sallow-skinned Eighth Doctor, with a shaved head, \\"hooded, glittering glacier-eyes\\", and an old hessian cloak; the Doctor's companion Fitz Kreiner, upon first seeing the Grandfather, thinks of him as looking like \\"the Doctor if he'd spent twenty years in the navy before becoming a psycho\\". In a flashback to the same events, The Gallifrey Chronicles offers a slightly different description of the Grandfather: his hair and skin are greying, and he wears a heavy leather cloak over the Eighth Doctor's original frock coat, which is now faded and cobwebbed. His movements are subtly different from the Doctor's, the loss of an arm having changed his centre of balance. The novel also suggests that the Grandfather's appearance varies, and that anyone who looks him in the eye will see themselves staring back. Conceptual history The character was first mentioned in Lawrence Miles's 1995 novel Christmas on a Rational Planet, which briefly describes his escape from Shada. Miles named the character in reference to the grandfather paradox, a thought experiment in which a time traveller kills their own grandfather, preventing their own birth, which prevents the murder, and so on in a paradoxical loop. The Grandfather influences events in several of Miles's later novels, but he never appears directly and is never identified. This changes in The Ancestor Cell, written by Peter Anghelides and Stephen Cole under incoming editor Justin Richards. In his review of the novel, Miles decried the revelation that the Grandfather is a future Doctor as \\"crass and predictable\\", labelling this version of the character as \\"just the Valeyard with a new haircut\\". Miles cited the lack of logic in having a more experienced Doctor outwitted by his younger self, declaring the resolution \\"obviously not true\\". All subsequent Faction Paradox stories written or edited by Miles ignore the revelations of The Ancestor Cell, leaving the Grandfather's identity a mystery. In a 2001 interview, Miles stated that he never meant the Grandfather to appear in person, comparing him to the Doctor's name or Judge Dredd's face as something that loses all value when revealed. He concluded, \\"If I had to have him appear in person, I'd probably make him Ronnie Barker in Porridge. The Norman Stanley Fletcher of Shada. With one arm.\\" In the second edition of their Doctor Who reference book AHistory, Lance Parkin and Lars Pearson attempt to reconcile the War depicted in the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels with the Last Great Time War depicted in the revived series of Doctor Who. They suggest that Grandfather Paradox is the Doctor who fought in the Last Great Time War, and that his experiences left him scarred and callous, without faith in humanity. After failing to prevent the younger Eighth Doctor from destroying Gallifrey in The Ancestor Cell, Grandfather Paradox regenerates into Christopher Eccleston's Ninth Doctor, regrowing his arm in the process. Parkin notes that this would explain the Ninth Doctor's conflicted recollection of Gallifrey's destruction in the episode \\"Dalek\\": \\"I watched it happen‚Ä¶ I made it happen‚Ä¶ I tried to stop it\\".

The Pink ribbon logo symbolizes support for breast cancer-related charities or foundations. The term 'pinkwashing' is associated with companies that use the pink ribbon symbol or use the support of breast cancer charities as a marketing technique, to promote one of their products, while at the same time manufactured products have proven to contain ingredients, that are linked to the disease developed or are used in a manner that associates it with the increased risk of disease.  Etymology  The term pinkwashing is compound word modelled on the term whitewashing, and was first coined by Breast Cancer Action (BCA). On thinkbeforeyoupink.org, a project of BCA, 'pinkwasher' is defined as, \\"a company or organisation that claims to care about breast cancer by promoting a pink ribbon product, but at the same time, produces, manufactures and/or sells products that are linked to the disease.\\"  Origin of the 'Pink ribbon'  The 'pink ribbon' first originated from a woman named Charlotte Hayley in 1992. Charlotte hand made and dispensed peach colored ribbons with informational cards that read \\" The National Cancer Institute annual budget is $1.8 billion, only 5% goes for cancer prevention. Help us wake up our legislators and Americans by wearing this ribbon\\". Self magazine in conjunction with Estee Lauder were working on a NBCAM matter that same year and proposed Hayley with an opportunity to contribute in the issue in a trade for the rights to use the peach coloured ribbon. Hayley declined the offer, having no desire to work with big companies. Following declining the offer, Self magazine and Estee Lauder changed the ribbons color to pink (to avoid legal difficulties over rights) and then used the ribbon as their emblem. Estee Lauder distributed the ribbons to woman at the cosmetic counters included with instructions on small cards how to conduct a correct self- examination for breast cancer.  'Pink ribbon' products draw critical examination  As the largest Organization monetizing breast cancer, Susan G. Komen Foundation and its licensing of a proprietary trademark is running the \\"pink ribbon\\" logo, and slogan on a wide range of products and has drawn close scrutiny over 'pinkwashing' products. Advertisement and marketing controversies One of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month's (NBCAM) largest supporters is the Astra Zeneca Health Care Foundation. \\"Since the Foundation began, it has supported NBCAM's goals of public awareness, public education, knowledge sharing, and greater access to services in the fight against breast cancer\\". However, some scholars question the true intentions of Astra Zeneca; in P. C. Pezzullos' article, \\"Resisting National Breast Cancer Awareness Month: The Rhetoric of Counter public and their Cultural Performances\\". the Toxic Links Coalition (TLC) disapproves of Astra Zeneca being NBCAM's initial supporter for two reasons: Firstly, Astra Zeneca is the manufacturer of the world's best selling cancer drug (a minority of activists believe this drug produces 'toxins' causing breast cancer- this is unproven, and considered false by the medical community); secondly, Astra Zeneca has profited from the promotion of mammograms (these same activists argue mammograms might be causing breast cancer- there is no evidence for this either). For this reason, \\"TLC emphasizes the importance of stopping the production of carcinogenic toxic chemicals\\" (Pezzullo, p. 353). Komen promotions which have drawn criticism include Houston-based fracking equipment and vendor Baker Hughes, who sponsored $100,000 for a campaign with the tagline, \\"Doing their bit for a cure\\". Opponents insist that hydraulic fracturing extracts oil and gas, using a mixture of water and chemicals, including known or possible carcinogens. Similar concerns have been raised about automobile manufacturers as sponsors, as vehicle exhaust contains carcinogens. Komens' own \\"Promise Me\\" perfume has also drawn Breast Cancer Action, as the label fails to disclose that the product contains galaxolide and toluene. The \\"pinkwashing\\" issue is not limited to Komen and its sponsors. In 2007, the Est√©e Lauder Pink Ribbon Collection series used a donation to The Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) to promote products containing parabens, chemicals linked to breast cancer. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration had connected 5-Hour Energy drinks, a caffeinated energy shot promoted using a Living Beyond Breast Cancer (LBBC) sponsorship as cause marketing, to thirteen deaths and serious injuries, including heart attacks. In 2008, Think Before You Pink launched an online campaign against Yoplait, the national sponsor of Susan G. Komen's annual walk. Their pink-lidded yogurt was sold to raise money for breast cancer but was made from dairy containing the hormone rBGH or rBST (recombinant bovine growth hormone or recombinant bovine somatotrophin). With enough pressure from the public, General Mills (the manufacture of Yoplait) pledged to go rBGH free. In 2010, Komen partnered with Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) briefly on a \\"Buckets for a Cure\\" campaign. In response, Breast Cancer Action launched the \\"What's the Cluck?\\" campaign, arguing that, although Komen's intentions may have been to promote KFC's new grilled chicken and vegetable meals, the same pink buckets held fried chicken, which can be attributed to high-fat diets linked to cancer risk and diseases. Komen contested and saw the marketing as effective because they were able to reach women who were not brought in by other advertisements in their neighbourhoods, like the billboards or the spokesperson at their church. According to Komen, KFC's pink buckets of chicken helped raise $4 million, and \\"money from partnerships such as this allowed Komen to provide screening mammograms to 600,000 women last year\\".Komen's pink ribbons raise lots of green, many questions; Survivors, groups ask world's largest charity fighting breast cancer to be more sensitive USA TODAY July 18, 2011 Monday See also * Purplewashing * Pink Ribbons, Inc., 2011 documentary * Feminationalism References  * External links * Think Before You Pink website * National Breast Cancer Foundation * World Health Organization Category:Advertising and marketing controversies Category:Breast cancer ","title":"Pinkwashing (breast cancer)"},{"id":"44821234","text":"Pinkwashing is a compound word modelled on the term whitewash. In the context of LGBT rights, it is used to describe a variety of marketing and political strategies aimed at promoting products, countries, people or entities through an appeal to gay-friendliness, in order to be perceived as progressive, modern and tolerant. The phrase was originally coined in 1992 by Breast Cancer Action to identify companies that claimed to support people with breast cancer while actually profiting from their illness.  Immigration  In 2013, the Human Rights Campaign officially endorsed comprehensive immigration reform and committed to helping immigrants as they seek health and safety, asylum or citizenship. The endorsement came days after an incident where a gay immigrant activist was prevented by HRC from discussing their legal status at a Supreme Court rally, mistreatment for which HRC later issued an apology. The Huffington Post described the HRC's actions as pinkwashing, \\"making immigration reform look pro-gay to garner LGBT support in order to mask the severe drawbacks of the legislation\\" ‚Äì drawbacks such as funding to support enforcement, deportation, and further US militarization. In 2012, Jason Kenney, Canada's Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, was accused of pinkwashing after an email titled \\"LGBT Refugees from Iran\\" was sent to thousands of Canadians. The message contained additional recent comments by John Baird, Minister of Foreign Affairs, about Canada's stand against the persecution and marginalization of gays and lesbian and women around the world. A group of activists claimed that it \\"is a poor attempt at 'pinkwashing' the Conservative government's obvious desire to encourage war with Iran.\\" United States According to Omar G. Encarnaci√≥n, a Professor of Political Studies at Bard College, the Obama administration was accused by some critics of pinkwashing \\"to distract from other unsavory policies such as the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants and the failure to prosecute those responsible for the human rights abuses of the Bush administration‚Äôs War on Terror.\\" Israeli government public relations Anarcho-queer collective Mashpritzot hold a \\"die-in\\" protest against Israeli pinkwashing and the perceived homonormative priorities of the LGBT support centre in Tel Aviv Sarah Schulman, a writer and professor at the City University of New York, claims Israeli government public relations campaign exploits the idea of Israel being LGBT-friendly to promote public perception of Israel as a \\"modern democracy\\", a \\"safe and secured place for investment\\", and a \\"tourist destination with the sun and the sand\\".Avraham, Eli. (2009), \\"Marketing and managing nation branding during prolonged crisis: The case of Israel\\". Vol. 5, 3, pp. 202‚Äì212. In August 2011, The Jerusalem Post reported the Foreign Ministry was promoting Gay Israel as part of its campaigns to counter the negative stereotypes that many liberal Americans and Europeans have of Israel. Critics of Israel like Jasbir Puar, an associate professor of Women's and Gender Studies at Rutgers University, cite the Israeli government's comparison of LGBT+ rights in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories as an example of pinkwashing. Citing WorldPride, which Jerusalem hosted in 2006, she wrote: \\"Within global gay and lesbian organising circuits, to be gay friendly is to be modern, cosmopolitan, developed, first- world, global north, and, most significantly, democratic.\\" Joseph Massad, associate professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University, has written that the Israeli government \\"insist[s] on advertising and exaggerating its recent record on LGBT rights ... to fend off international condemnation of its violations of the rights of the Palestinian people.\\" Israeli response According to some in Israel, pinkwashing allegations against Israel constitute a straw man argument, and Israel's embrace of the LGBT community has never been used to justify or excuse the Israeli occupation of Palestine. To them, the fact that Israel is generally tolerant towards LGBT individuals and groups on both state and individual levels is a factual contrast to the discriminatory and often-brutal treatment given to LGBT people by Arab and Muslim groups. Ido Aharoni, former head of the Brand Israel project, responded to such criticism saying: \\"We are not trying to hide the conflict but broaden the conversation. We want to create a sense of relevance with other communities.\\" Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard University law professor and a frequent defender of Israel, has said that the term pinkwashing is used against Israel by \\"some radical gay activists\\" who are antisemitic \\"bigots.\\" He called the use of the term pinkwashing in this context as \\"nothing more than anti-Semitism with a pink face.\\" Yair Qedar, a gay Israeli filmmaker and civil rights activist, has said that Israel has a praiseworthy LGBT+ rights record and that failing to defend it \\"ultimately serves homophobia far more than dialogue and peace\\". He criticized Israeli LGBT+ groups for failing to oppose pinkwashing charges. Shaul Ganon of the Israeli based LGBT+ rights group Aguda, assessed the dispute this way: \\"Each side is trying to gain some points. The truth is the only one who gets screwed by this is the Palestinian gays.\\"  Corporate marketing  A campaign to develop public support for the Keystone Pipeline, which would transport Canadian oil through the United States, has been accused of pinkwashing for its argument that the project deserves support based on a comparison of Canada's record on LGBT rights compared to that of other oil-producing nations. The campaign base at OpecHatesgays.com headlines its presentation: \\"Compare Canadian Ethical Oil to OPEC conflict oil\\". In 2014, BP launched \\"LGBT Careers Event\\", a move that was met with criticism as an attempt to pinkwash the conduct that led to Deepwater Horizon oil spill, described as \\"the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced\\". In Australia, concern has been raised about the commodification of gay rights by major corporations. In 2019 several companies who had previously claimed to support the LGBTQ community, including Marriott International, Delta Airlines, UnitedHealth Group, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America, were criticized for their sponsorship of an event honoring Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who self-identifies as \\"homophobic\\" and \\"very proud of it.\\" According to NBC News, Bolsonaro was being honored \\"for his prioritizing of Christian values and family.\\" Some sponsors withdrew after criticism, including Bain & Co., the Financial Times, and Delta. Anti-Islamic rhetoric A coalition organized by several popular grassroots movements in Europe, including the English Defence League (EDL), mounted demonstrations in conjunction with LGBT Pride Week celebrations in Helsinki and Stockholm in July and August 2012. In an interview for Radio Sweden, the Swedish author and activist Lisa Bjurwald claimed that the EDL have exploited pride events in the United Kingdom by diverting attention toward Islamic homophobia and that Queers against Pinkwashing (a group that protested against the Stockholm march) is opposed to talking about homophobia in Islam and label all such attempts as \\"pinkwashing\\" and a \\"divide and conquer tactic.\\"  Intersex movement  In June 2016, Organisation Intersex International Australia pointed to contradictory statements by Australian governments, suggesting that the dignity and rights of LGBT and intersex people are recognized while, at the same time, harmful practices on intersex children continue. In August 2016, Zwischengeschlecht described actions to promote equality or civil status legislation without action on banning \\"intersex genital mutilations\\" as a form of pinkwashing. The organization has previously highlighted evasive government statements to UN Treaty Bodies that conflate intersex, transgender and LGBT issues, instead of addressing harmful practices on infants.  Country comparisons  Stephan Lefebvre of the Center for Economic and Policy Research has noted how the Obama administration, followed by the mainstream US media, has criticized Russia for its failure to provide basic civil liberties for its LGBT population. He contrasts that with the US government's failure to condemn the comparable record on LGBT issues on the part of US allies like Honduras, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the US government's failure to acknowledge progress on LGBT rights in Cuba. In his analysis, this constitutes pinkwashing, which he defines as \\"deliberately highlighting support for gay rights while ignoring or downplaying other relevant human rights issues\\". Laurie Penny, an author and feminist activist, contrasted those who criticized Russia's LGBT policies during the Sochi Olympics with their silence on instances of homophobic treatment at their own countries' border crossings.

Rather than following the standard form of an autobiography, they comprises a rambling collection of anecdotes and ruminations. Much of the text was dictated. These chapters comprise only a fraction of the autobiographical work written by Twain. Other material, which was unpublished and in a disorganised state at the time of Twain's death in 1910, was progressively collated and published over the next 100 years in various forms. Chapters Chapter 1 Chapter 1 appeared in the September 7, 1906 issue of the North American Review. Twain tells his readers that his autobiography won't be about ‚Äúshowy episodes‚Äù in his life, but rather about common experiences from the life of an average person. Then he writes about a conversation he has with American author and lifelong friend, William Dean Howells, and tells him that this autobiography will help set the standard for future autobiographies and will still be read for thousands of years to come. Howells agrees with him that this work will indeed be that revolutionary. Then he goes on to talk about how his family grew up in Jamestown. Chapter 2 Chapter 2 appeared in the September 21, 1906 issue of the North American Review. This Chapter focuses mostly on Twain's first experiences as an author, which started in 1867, when Charles H. Webb, editor and reporter, suggested that he published a volume of sketches. He knew him through the story called ‚ÄúThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,‚Äù which was published in The Saturday Press, and later copied in newspapers in America and England. However, even though people knew this story, Twain was not famous yet. After Carleton refused to publish Twain's work, the sketches ended up being published by Webb himself. In 1868, Elisha Bliss, from the American Publishing Company of Hartford, asked Twain to publish a book recounting the Quaker City Excursion he just went on. The company did not publish it right away because they thought that it might have an impact on the house's reputation. Twain insisted, and they ended up publishing it in 1869, which, according to Bliss, took the publishing house out of debt. When he was fourteen years old, Twain's sister had a party at their house, and was supposed to dress up as a bear in order to perform in a small play. He went to change in a room, and practiced his role, not knowing that there were two girls in that room, who saw him. When he understood what happened, he was ashamed. He never knew who the girls were, and after this event, he suspected all the girls he knew. Chapter 3 Chapter 3 appeared in the October 5, 1906 issue of the North American Review. This chapter focuses on two of the most important women in the author's life: his wife Olivia, and one of his three daughters: Susy. Twain begins this chapter by reminiscing on his deceased wife: he is writing the day before their thirty- sixth anniversary. The first two pages of this chapter can be considered as a eulogy of Twain's wife. He then draws a parallel between her death and that of his daughter Susy who succumbed to meningitis at age twenty-four. A significant detail about her death is that her last word was ‚ÄúMamma.‚Äù Twain relies on the bond which existed between his wife and his daughter to write an even longer (eight pages) eulogy of his Susy, emphasizing her intelligence and quick thinking even as young child, and her having inherited her mother's positive qualities (thoughtfulness, altruism, maturity, honesty). He almost apologizes for only wanting to focus on the positive aspects of her life. Very interestingly, Twain's other children Langdon, Clara, and Jean are only mentioned for context, and Twain does not give the reader many details about himself. Therefore, this chapter is mostly a biography of his deceased wife and daughter. Chapter 4 Chapter 4 appeared in the October 19, 1906 issue of the North American Review. This chapter begins with Twain remarking on how honored he felt when his daughter Susy started compiling a biography of him. He then begins explaining some of the entries from it, saying that he will not be making any alternations to her text in order to maintain its purity. He details how reviewers often misjudged him during this time (specifically accusations of plagiarism and comments against his physical appearance). Susy chooses to spend part of her biography defending him against these criticisms. Twain then goes on to explain how Susy captured his temper. She does this specifically by describing a situation in which Twain becomes frustrated and sarcastic about the security system in his home never working efficiently. Other stories are summarized, such as Twain's ability to tell a story based on images/paintings in their home, as well as tales of Twain's interactions with their peculiarly named cats (Satan and Sin). Twain ends the chapter by again praising Susy's honesty, saying about her, ‚ÄúThis is a frank historian.‚Äù He seems generally delighted and flattered throughout the chapter that his daughter chose to become his biographer at such a young age as 15. Chapter 5 Chapter 5 appeared in the November 2, 1906 issue of the North American Review. This chapter provides some context about Twain's siblings: Orion, Margaret, Pamela, Benjamin, and Henry. Margaret and Benjamin both died young. Twain then goes on to tell a lot of Orion's life story, mainly dealing with his internal struggles. He was a very eager man, but he also suffered from ‚Äúdeep glooms.‚Äù He was also very indecisive in what sort of career he wanted. He attempted to learn the printer's trade, how to be a lawyer, and how to be an orator. His indecisiveness carried into his religion and politics as well. It's mentioned several times throughout the chapter that although he was indecisive, he was always sincere, truthful and honest. He had an incredible drive to please others. After his father's death he returned home to help support his mother and youngest brother, Henry. Twain then moves into a brief description of his apprenticeship during this time, describing its benefits along with his relationship with his boss and his fellow apprentices. Chapter 6 Chapter 6 appeared in the November 16, 1906 issue of the North American Review. Chapter 7 Chapter 7 appeared in the December 7, 1906 issue of the North American Review. Chapter 8 Chapter 8 appeared in the December 21, 1906 issue of the North American Review. In this chapter, Mark Twain describes living and working in Nevada as the City Editor for Mr. Goodman's Virginia City Enterprise. He was twenty-nine years old at the time. Dueling was in fashion, and several of his coworkers at the paper got involved and encouraged him to as well, which he eventually did while working on an editorial for Shakespeare's birthday in 1864. Another editor, Mr. Laird the for the Virginia City Union, working on a similar editorial. Issuing a challenge for a duel in traditional fashion, the men met to duel, but did not go through with it. Shortly after Twain's failed attempt at a duel, a new was passed that carried a two-year jail sentence with dueling. Since Twain had engaged in challenging someone to a duel on several occasions, he fled the territory and did not engage in dueling activities again. Chapter 9 Chapter 9 appeared in the January 4, 1907 issue of the North American Review. This chapter centers on Twain's ideas about how humans are designed for monarchical rule over democracy. He discusses how ‚Äúthe human race was always intended to be governed by kingship, not by popular vote‚Äù due to people's inclination toward power. To get this idea across, he tells the story of how he pretended to be hypnotized by a ‚Äúmesmerizer,‚Äù a hypnotist referred to as Hicks, who visited his hometown when he was fifteen. He eventually became the only participant in his show because of his convincing performance, even though his hypnosis was only an act. He started to crave the attention he received, and he wanted the crowd to favor him over Hicks. Thirty-five years after the fact, he decided to tell his mother that it was a lie. To his surprise she said, ‚ÄúYou were only a child then, and could not have done it.‚Äù He admitted to his faults, but his mother refused to believe that it was true. Chapter 10 Chapter 10 appeared in the January 18, 1907 issue of the North American Review. This chapter discusses Orion Clemens (born July 17, 1825 in Jamestown, Tennessee), who was Twain's eldest brother, antedating him by ten years. After a series of moves, he and his family found themselves living in Hannibal, Missouri, when he was twelve years old. At the age of fifteen, Orion had moved to St. Louis to learn the printing trade. During his apprenticeship, Orion would become good friends with Edward Bates, who later served in President Lincoln‚Äôs first cabinet. During his time in St. Louis, Orion was known to change his ventures to match his ever-changing interests. He would set out to be a lawyer one week, and next an orator. Despite his constant change of interest and desire, Orion would always put forth his best effort and maximum concentration, even if the interest changed after a week‚Äôs time. In this chapter, Twain uses the phrase \\"Lies, damned lies, and statistics\\", attributing it to Benjamin Disraeli. This usage is believed to have popularised the phrase. Chapter 11 Chapter 11 appeared in the February 1, 1907 issue of the North American Review. Chapter 12 Chapter 12 appeared in the February 15, 1907 issue of the North American Review. Chapter 13 Chapter 13 appeared in the March 1, 1907 issue of the North American Review. Twain touches on his youth but focuses mainly on the summers he spent on his uncle‚Äôs farm a couple miles outside of Florida, Missouri, the town of his birth. The summers he spent here from about ages 6-13 were highly influential on his writing and his development as a person. It is here that he was exposed to the African American slave life, which affected him deeply. A slave, \\"Unc'l Daniel,\\" had the most impact, serving as an inspiration for the character Jim in the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and shaping his view of African Americans. He states: ‚ÄúIt was on the farm that I got my strong liking for his race and my appreciation of certain of its fine qualities.‚Äù This farm was the model for the farm used in Huck Finn. In the town of Florida, he would also draw inspiration from people he met, developing them into characters such as General and Injun Joe. Chapter 14 Chapter 14 appeared in the March 15, 1907 issue of the North American Review. This chapter begins with an excerpt from Susy's biography of him in which she talks about how her sister Clara was always opposite from her. Clara always seemed to be braver than she was as she would stand perfectly still when having a sliver of wood removed from her finger while Susy would be very cowardly. Twain remarks on how Susy had a knack for remembering things very accurately. He then goes on to exclaim his pride in Clara's saying that she was brave, but nobody was braver than God. He was proud that Clara was becoming a great thinker and observer. Twain then moves into a long story about how his family once moved to Berlin, Germany, where he was invited to a dinner with Emperor Wilhelm II. Before going to the party, Twain became friends with one of the officials at the Foreign Office who he would call Smith. Smith was tired of having to work all the time and was considering resigning without getting a vacation. In the end during the party, Smith got his vacation and Twain was honored by the Kaiser, who praised \\"Old Times on the Mississippi\\". Twain then explains that he had broken the unspoken law in Germany that if someone entered a house after ten, they must pay a toll to the doorman for waking him. In the later entries Twain would reflect back on the imperial dinner with the Kaiser. Chapter 15 Chapter 15 appeared in the April 5, 1907 issue of the North American Review. This chapter begins with Twain describing his experience renting kittens for the summer time. He relates the three kittens he had at the time to the people around him. Twain claims that conformity is inevitable within most living creatures, especially in man: ‚ÄúThey are afraid to be outside; whatever the fashion happens to be, they conform to it.‚Äù Twain then describes his innate desire to stand out in a conforming world. He mentions his old age briefly and ponders the thought that this quality could in fact benefit his hope to express himself freely, specifically through the act of potentially wearing a colorful wardrobe in the dead of winter. ‚ÄúWe all conform to the prevailing insanity,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúand go about in dreary black, each man doing it because the others do it.‚Äù The chapter concludes with a few stories of young men he defeated in the game of billiards, discussing his secret behind winning so often. This streak went on until George Robertson visited from Boston and defeated Twain at last after doubling the bet four times in a row. Chapter 16 Chapter 16 appeared in the April 19, 1907 issue of the North American Review. In this chapter, Twain recounts having his word discounted since he was young. Somewhere between the ages of 7 and 12, he believes his mother learned the art of interpreting his stories. Twain quotes her by saying, \\"I discount him thirty percent for embroidery, and what is left is perfect and priceless truth, without a flaw in it anywhere.\\" Approximately forty years later, as part of The Monday Evening Club, Twain told a story of a dream he had foreshadowing the death of his brother, Henry. In his dream, he saw his brother dressed in one of Twain's suits, in a metallic casket, lying across two chairs, with a bouquet of roses on his breast, mostly white with a red rose in the center. Three weeks later, Henry had actually died and all of the details from his dream were present. Another member, Dr. Burton, asked how long he'd been telling the story and how often, explaining that he used to tell a story of his own and found pleasure in astonishing his audience. After 10 to 15 years, he reexamined the tale and found it to be one part fact and twenty-four parts embroidery. Even after the confrontation, Twain believed the accuracy of his tale. Chapter 17 Chapter 17 appeared in the May 3, 1907 issue of the North American Review. The initial sections of this chapter contain recollections written by daughter Susy around age thirteen. In one significant moment, he discusses how the innocent memory of bubble blowing has transformed in his mind, coming to represent the fragility of Susy's life. Twain laments the passing of his daughter, commenting, ‚ÄúSusy... was as lovely a bubble as any we made that day -- and as transitory. She passed... and nothing of her is left but a heartbreak and a memory.‚Äù Shifting focus from his daughter, Twain recounts brief memories of dangerous situations he witnessed as a young man. Years later, these moments have morphed into anxieties revisited during sleepless nights. Twain tells the reader of his eventual conclusion: ‚ÄúThey were inventions of Providence to beguile me to a better life.‚Äù A final section of the chapter recalls the inspiration for Twain's short story ‚ÄúJim Wolf and the Cats.‚Äù This piece was eventually disseminated far enough that other authors began to take credit for it. Twain recounts one such writer who played upon sympathies, successfully finding a way to submit the story as his own. Chapter 18 Chapter 18 appeared in the May 17, 1907 issue of the North American Review. This chapter covers Twain's history with schoolmates. He reflects on their stories that he remembers and even acknowledges times of envy and sympathy for his fellow pupils, recalling their past and explaining their present if he knew of it. He speaks of old crushes, past envies of hair and attraction, and those whom he knows have since passed. If a schoolmate is mentioned, there is an accompanying story of varying length. These stories are scattered throughout the chapter, but the majority of the longer ones are collected toward the end of it. As the chapter continues, Twain starts discussing others in his past not just his schoolmates. Sometimes he even finds relevance in relatives and descendants of those who made up his past. Chapter 19 Chapter 19 appeared in the June 7, 1907 issue of the North American Review. This chapter primarily recounts anecdotes about Twain's children and their personalities, borrowing some passages from Susy's biography to aid this. It opens with Susy recalling one of her birthday parties at which her father and some of his friends passionately played charades. When his writing returns, he notes that their passion for acting in this way transitioned into a love for putting on plays. Around the age of ten Susy had begun to write plays that she, a friend, and Clara would put on for themselves and the servants around the house. Another portion of Susy's biography has her thinking on how Twain takes his stories to Olivia to expurgate, sometimes with despair at what is taken out. Twain responds by noting that it would be a shame to take Susy's ‚Äúfree spelling‚Äù out, before transitioning to a discussion of Andrew Carnegie and his attempts to reform the English language to be more phonetic. He then offers several stories about his children, admiring that Susy seems to be ‚Äúa thinker, a poet, and a philosopher‚Äù along with Clara's creativity shown through her musical interest. Chapter 20 Chapter 20 appeared in the July 5, 1907 issue of the North American Review. Chapter 21 Chapter 21 appeared in the August 2, 1907 issue of the North American Review. This chapter has an overall theme of memory and remembrance. Twain discusses how he believes this to be the last book of his lifetime and takes the reader on a journey of random memories and inspirations for his famous novels. He begins with an excerpt from his daughter Susy's biography of him. She is worried he will not continue writing but believes that her mother, Olivia, can convince him to do so. Her writings are most likely very precious to Twain since they are something she left behind after her death. He is becoming increasingly fed up with writing and even believes he is a slave to the pen. Twain continues through the chapter being worried his memory is failing him, and therefore discusses random things he can remember. He ends with thoughts of death. Chapter 22 Chapter 22 appeared in the September 1907 issue of the North American Review. Twain begins this chapter with a recollection of the way he subdued a chaotic and noisy dinner conversation into a more enjoyable one, by comically showing the other attendees just how off-putting their volume was. This get-together is mentioned in his daughter Susy's biography of him. He goes on to tell a story of one of the many jokes Dean Sage, another of the guests assembled, played on a Rev. Mr. Harris. Twain spends much of the chapter discussing duels and his fascination with them, mentioning in passing his ‚Äúunmaterialized‚Äù and ‚Äúineffectual‚Äù duel that he discusses in greater detail in chapter 8. He contrasts the danger of the Austrian style of dueling with the safety of the French style, though he discusses Austrian duels to a greater extent. He suggests that if the families of the duellists were required to be in attendance, duels would slow to a halt faster and more efficiently than outlawing them. He mentions his interest in the particular case of Felice Cavallotti, an Italian ‚Äúpoet, orator, satirist, statesman, patriot.‚Äù He had also fought in thirty Austrian-style duels, and died with his head skewered by a sword in one. Chapter 23 Chapter 23 appeared in the October 1907 issue of the North American Review. Twain spends most of this chapter discussing old schoolmates and people he grew up with. He considers the fact that many are now dead or very old, contrasting with the youths he had once known. He also discusses how Mr. Richmond, Twain's old Sunday school teacher, came to possess ‚ÄúTom Sawyer‚Äôs cave in the hills three miles from town, and had made a tourist- resort out of it. This chapter deals quite a bit with death‚Äînot only in the deaths of his schoolmates, but the death of a twelve-year-old girl from heart disease, as well as the many deaths caused by measles in his hometown in 1845. He relates the story of how he managed to give himself the disease, how close he came to death, and the vanity and gratification felt by his young self at having all of his relatives give him so much emotional attention. Twain states that one of the proudest moments of his life was reading Sydney Brooks‚Äô ‚ÄúEngland‚Äôs Ovation to Mark Twain.‚Äù He ends the chapter with the an even prouder moment of his, that of attending the Oxford Historical Pageant Day in 1907. Chapter 24 Chapter 24 appeared in the November 1907 issue of the North American Review. The first half of this chapter is Twain discussing the people and small scenes that took place throughout his life. This deals with Twain's vacationing spot in Onteora Park in the Catskills Mountains where the natives were constantly surprised by the resorters‚Äô enthusiasm for their taken-for-granted scenery. It also deals with Twain's time in Hartford, Connecticut, where he made important social and literary friends such as Charles Dudley Warner and Joel Chandler Harris. He also briefly mentions a shy fellow he knew when he was fourteen: Jim Wolf, his brother's apprentice in Hannibal, Missouri. Lastly is James Redpath, who was a publicist and friend of John Brown during the Bleeding Kansas days. Redpath would also become Twain's agent when Twain became a public lecturer since Redpath had opened a lecture business. The second half of the chapter deals with Twain's devotion to studying the human race by using himself as an example. In one of his studies, Twain compares old and broken pool tables and bowling alleys to new and improved gaming outfits. He claims that the older game outfits should be more interesting as it takes more skill to play old and broken games than new games.

It purports to be the building where \\"Miss Hattie\\" operated a brothel from 1902 to 1952. History In 1870, Bartholomew J. DeWitt established San Angelo across the Concho River from Fort Concho. The town was soon one of general good stores, saloons, and brothels, and earned a poor reputation. The fort and its garrisons of African American soldiers were often at odds‚Äîsometimes violently‚Äîwith the town's citizenry. DeWitt had borrowed money from a San Antonio-based investor, Marcus Koenigheim to found San Angelo. When DeWitt could not repay Koenigheim, the latter man sued the former and settled for the remaining property DeWitt had not managed to sell. The venture was not profitable to the point of Koenigheim being unable to rid himself of it by sale. He attempted to raise the property value in the town by giving land to churches. From the 1890s to the early 20th century, San Angelo passed ordinances to limit prostitution in the city. In 1977, Evelyn Hill and Juania Higuera purchased 18.5 E. Concho. Two years later, Hill remodeled the upper story of the building into the present museum. Museum established, Hill created the story of Miss Hattie's bordello, alleging that it operated from 1902 to 1952. According to Miss Hattie's Bordello Museum, the brothel was established by a Mrs. Hatton while her husband ran a saloon on the ground floor. A Hatton, E. A. Hatton, did build and operate a business at 18.5 E. Concho, but he and his wife left San Angelo within two years and did not operate a brothel in the building. By 1912, there were four separate businesses on the first floor while the second floor was vacant. A bordello is believed to have occupied the second floor of 18.5 E. Concho from 1936 to 1949.

The distance of the trail between Fort Edmonton and Athabasca Landing was 100 miles, giving the trail the nickname \\"The 100 Mile Portage.\\" The Saskatchewan flows east and joins the Nelson River which then drains into Hudson Bay. The Athabasca flows north and joins the Slave River, which itself joins the Mackenzie River which drains into the Arctic Ocean. The portage, therefore, had local economic significance but was also part of a wider trade network that linked the Arctic and sub-arctic to the rest of North America. Various portage routes between the two rivers had been used by the indigenous peoples of the region for centuries before the arrival of British and Canadian fur traders in region in the late eighteenth century. Once fur trading posts were established in the region, the same simple trails were also used to move freight between the posts. They linked Edmonton House (in all of its various incarnations of the years), the centre of the Saskatchewan District, to posts in the Athabasca District (including the Peace River Country) such as Dunvegan, Fort St. Mary's, Fort Chipewyan, and Fort Vermilion. The main packroute northwards from Edmonton from 1824 to 1876 was that to Fort Assiniboine, well to the west of the later Athabasca Landing Trail. It was due to HBC scouts seeking an alternative to the Fort Assiniboine route that Athabasca Landing was founded in 1876 The North-West Mounted Police stationed nine officers at Athabasca Landing in 1893. In 2010, a conceptual master plan for the modern version of the Athabasca Landing Trail was completed. The plan is to build a 150 km non-motorized recreational trail, which runs between Fort Saskatchewan and Athabasca, and highlights the region's historic and natural features. The route is also designated as part of the Trans Canada Trail; it links to the River Valley Alliance Trail in the south and to both the land and water routes north to the Arctic Ocean.

Life √âmile Poillot was born in Dijon, C√¥te-d'Or, France, on . He received his first musical training from his father, Jules Poillot, who has been playing the choir organ of the Saint-Michel church in Dijon during 54 years. In 1895 √âmile Poillot joined the choir of the Dijon Cathedral, directed by the Reverend Father Ren√© Moissenet, whose brother and assistant, the Reverend Father Joseph Moissenet, gave him piano lessons and introduced him to play the organ. In 1900 he went to the Dijon Conservatory in Adolph Dietrich's piano and harmony classes. He won a first prize in piano performance in 1901 and in harmony in 1902. In October 1903, he entered the Conservatoire de Paris, where he studied piano in Isidor Philipp‚Äôs class and received a first prize in piano performance under Philipp's successor, √âdouard Risler, in 1907. Then he studied organ with Alexandre Guilmant and Louis Vierne and received a first prize in organ performance and improvisation under Guilmant's successor, Eug√®ne Gigout, in 1911: Poillot also studied the history of music with Maurice Emmanuel. From 1904 to 1907, at the Basilica of Sainte-Clotilde in Paris, Poillot was assistant to Maurice Emmanuel, the choirmaster, and substitute for Leon Cazajus, the choir organist, during the tenure of Charles Tournemire at the great organ. In 1911, he was named the regular organist at the Cathedral of St. Benignus in Dijon. He played the organ during 36 years, until his death. In 1919, he was appointed as professor of piano at the Conservatory of Dijon and this position he held for 25 years. He died in Dijon on . Andr√© Fleury took over from him in 1949 as organist at the Cathedral of St. Benignus and professor of piano at the Conservatory of Dijon. Among his students were Michel Chapuis and Ralph L. Grosvenor. His grandson, Michel Poillot, is the organist of the Basilica Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Garde in Longpont-sur-Orge, Essonne, France, since 1997. A street is named after him in Dijon. Performer As an organist, Poillot falls within the tradition of performers and improvisers of the French school of the early twentieth century. He was particularly known for his brilliant improvisations. At that time, it was rare to hear the organ outside the offices or religious events. However, some concerts have marked his career, such as the broadcast performance he gave on 19 March 1932 at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. As a pianist, √âmile Poillot gave many concerts, solo or as accompanist. He accompanied his friend cellist Maurice Mar√©chal during several tours in Spain (1925 and 1926), in France (1928), in Singapore (7 August 1933) and in the Dutch East Indies (August and September 1933).

The first Roman Catholic church in Townsville, St Joseph's, was erected on the Strand in the 1870s. Townsville itself had been established in the mid-1860s as a port to service the pastoral lands of the interior. Following the discovery of gold at Ravenswood and Charters Towers in the 1870s, the town boomed, and by the 1890s was the principal port of North Queensland. As the population of the town expanded and settlement moved west along Ross Creek, a more prominent, substantial and centrally-located Catholic church became a priority for the parish. In January 1884 Father William Mason Walsh, Townsville's second parish priest, acquired title to a half acre block in Stanley Street on the slopes of Castle Hill, above the main business district of Townsville, in anticipation of erecting a fine new church. However at this period the parish of Townsville was part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockhampton, and was neither large nor wealthy, so it did not commence a building programme for the church on Stanley Street until the 1890s. An 1894 design competition for the new church was won by prominent Melbourne architects Reed, Smart & Tappin. Their design was for a substantial brick building of Gothic style, comprising a large basement space, a superstructure consisting of naive, aisles, transept, sacristy, chapters and sanctuary, and an imposing front tower and spire rising . There is some suggestion that the design for the Townsville church was a smaller version of the Sacred Heart Cathedral at Bendigo, Victoria, designed by the same architectural firm. Excavation of the Stanley Street site, foundations and basement were carried out in 1896, at a cost of ¬£1,160 for the basements alone. No further progress was made until 7 October 1900, when the Right Rev. Dr Joseph Higgins, Bishop of Rockhampton, laid the foundation stone. However, not until early 1902 did work commence on the first stage of the superstructure ‚Äì nave and aisles. Denis Kelleher, who had erected the Catholic cathedral in Rockhampton, won the contract, which was completed within 10 months at a cost of ¬£8,330, and the building blessed and opened by Bishop Higgins on 16 November 1902. The interior was considered to be remarkably well finished, with very fine ceilings of varnished pine, cut into panels and with fretwork borders. Little more than 3 months after the November opening, the Church of the Sacred Heart was severely damaged by Cyclone Leonta, which struck Townsville on 3 March 1903. The building was unroofed (over 2 tons of iron sheeting) and substantial water damage to the interior resulted. The damage was repaired, but the original plan to build a belltower and extend the transept back towards Castle Hill in order to create a chapel behind the altar, was never carried out. Later a steel bell tower was erected. Following the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Townsville , the Church of the Sacred Heart, as the church of the Bishop of Townsville, acquired cathedral status. The roof was damaged again in 1972 during cyclone Althea, causing water damage to the interior northern wall. The steel belltower was removed and donated to the non-denominational chapel at Lavarack Barracks in the 1970s. Part of the side fence of decorative iron and brick posts was removed at the same time.  Description  Sacred Heart Cathedral 2019 Sacred Heart Cathedral, 1903 The Sacred Heart Cathedral is rectangular in plan and is modelled on a Roman basilica design, with a high ceiling above the nave, aisles on either side and an apse which is framed by a timber arch lined with tongue and groove timber. The tunnel-vault with truss design ceiling is of tongue and groove board. The gable roof is of corrugated iron, and the facade has two turrets and large Gothic windows on either side of the central statue niche. The external walls of red face brick have tuck pointed mortar joints and contrasting cement rendered mouldings. An unusual feature of the structure is that it faces north-south rather than the traditional east-west direction of most cathedrals. The restricted hillside site was probably the reason for the placement of the building. The site is accessed from the northeast street frontage, and the altar faces southwest. The cathedral is built on a rocky spur of Castle Hill, across from the equally commanding St James Anglican Cathedral, overlooking the central business district of the city. The lower slopes of the hill are covered with grass and small shrubs which cling to the rough terrain. A rock-faced retaining wall edges the cathedral block and creates a roadway from Stanley Street. Grassed areas surround the building together with small shrubs at the base of the main stairs. Close to the cathedral is a 1938, two-storeyed brick building which houses the bishop of the Sacred Heart Cathedral and the priest of the cathedral parish. This building of red brick and stucco echoes some of the decorative features of the cathedral.  Heritage listing  Sacred Heart Cathedral was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Townsville's Sacred Heart Cathedral, erected 1896-1902, is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland's history, reflecting the struggle of the Catholic Church to secure its position ‚Äì spiritually, politically and economically ‚Äì in the frontier towns of 19th century Queensland. That the whole of the original design was never carried out illustrates the fluctuating fortunes of the Catholic Church in North Queensland, as well as the principal turn-of-the- century economic determinants, including the 1890s depression, drought 1900-02, and cyclone Leonta of 1903. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Designed to impress, the Sacred Heart Cathedral remains important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a large brick church incorporating traditional Gothic stylistic elements, yet located in a tropical environment. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The cathedral occupies a commanding position on Castle Hill overlooking the city, and has strong aesthetic value, contributing significantly to the townscape of Townsville. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a landmark, it has a strong association for the local community, and the place remains a focus of Catholicism in North Queensland. Sacred Heart Cathedral is important also for its association with Catholic worship in Townsville since 1902.

Early life Perkins was born at Strood in Kent, the son of the Rev Thomas Norwood Perkins, the curate of Strood in 1870, and his wife, the former Emily Louisa Tosswill. He was educated at St John's School, Leatherhead and Jesus College, Cambridge.Perkins, Mr Thomas Toswell Norwood, Obituaries in 1946, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1947. Retrieved 11 November 2018. Before going to Cambridge University in 1891, he was an assistant schoolmaster at Oxford and Great Yarmouth; he was almost 21 when he started at Cambridge. Sporting career Perkins won a Blue for association football in all three years he was at Cambridge. He was described in his Wisden obituary as a \\"powerful soccer player\\" who played with \\"dash at centre-forward\\". He captained the Cambridge side in 1894-95 as Cambridge beat Oxford in the varsity match. He went on to play football for Cornwall, Norfolk and Essex. Perkins did not appear in the university cricket team until his second year, when he established himself as a right-handed lower or middle-order batsman. In his second first-class match, a 12-a-side game against the Gentlemen of England team, he batted at No 9 and top-scored with an unbeaten 57 in the first Cambridge innings. The 1893 University match against Oxford University was won easily by Cambridge, and Perkins, batting at No 8, scored 18 and 37. After the university term was over, Perkins played for Kent, and in the game against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge he scored 109, which was his only first-class century. In 1894, Perkins played in most of the university team's first-class games and scored 23 and 24 in the University match, which was a decisive win for Oxford. From this game, he went on to the Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval, appearing for the Gentlemen side which was captained by W. G. Grace. He played a few more matches for Kent in the second half of the 1894 season and rounded the year off by appearing in the Gentlemen of the South against the Players of the South game at Lord's in mid-September, though in a very strong batting side he came in at No 10. From 1895, Perkins became a schoolmaster, although he does not appear to have graduated finally from Cambridge University until 1896. He was an assistant master at St Michael's School in Westgate-on-Sea, Kent in 1895, at Felsted School in Essex from 1897 to 1900, and at Rossall School in Lancashire from 1900 to 1903. He returned to first-class with Kent in a few games at the end of the 1899 season and more regularly in school holidays in 1900: he scored 88 in the match against Lancashire in 1900 and put on 221 for the fifth wicket with Cuthbert Burnup, who made 200. He did not appear in first-class cricket after the 1900 season. Later life Perkins was joint headmaster of two preparatory schools in the Bath area from 1904 to 1912 and played in Minor Counties cricket for Wiltshire in that period. He was then headmaster of Larchfield School at Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, Scotland from 1915 to 1932 when he retired to Kent; among his teachers at Larchfield were the poets Cecil Day-Lewis and W. H. Auden. He died at Tonbridge in Kent in 1946 aged 75.Thomas Perkins, CricInfo. Retrieved 11 November 2018.

The engine was developed for and targeted at eighth-generation hardware and DirectX 11-compatible platforms, such as Xbox One, the PlayStation 4, and versions of Microsoft Windows. It was conceived during the development of Final Fantasy XIII-2 to be compatible with next generation consoles that their existing platform, Crystal Tools, could not handle. The engine powered the Agni's Philosophy and Witch Chapter 0 tech demos. It currently centers on Final Fantasy XV, a title in the Final Fantasy series for eighth-generation consoles, and an untitled AAA video game. In early 2018, the development team of Final Fantasy XV were established by Square Enix as a new subsidiary studio dubbed Luminous Productions. The aim was to create new AAA video games for a global audience using Luminous Studio, which was renamed as Luminous Engine later on. Development Origins According to Julien Merceron, the Worldwide Technology Director for Square Enix in the early 2010s, the concept for the new engine was born in 2011 while he was in the final stages of working on Final Fantasy XIII-2. This was a difficult period for Square Enix: the project then known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII was hitting technical barriers as it transitioned to open-world environments its original Crystal Tools engine could not handle, and Final Fantasy XIV had met with a disastrous launch due to development and technical problems. Faced with these issues, Square Enix decided to bring in former developers from Sega to create new engines for their products, including Luminous Studio. Talking about sharing the engine, Merceron said that he advised the company to avoid sharing between companies or internally between games until the engine had been finalized with the released game: this resulted in Luminous Studio being restricted to what would become Final Fantasy XV during development, while other major next-generation titles would use other outsourced engines. The construction of Luminous was similar in concept to Epic Games' Unreal Engine or the Unity engine from Unity Technologies in that it incorporated all the development tools needed from asset editing onward, as well as being \\"high quality, easy to use, flexible, high speed, compact, and supporting both manual and automatic [game development methods].\\" The development team drew inspiration for this concept and approach from Unreal Engine and Crytek's CryEngine. The name \\"Luminous\\" was chosen to reflect the crystal theme of the Final Fantasy series. There were many major factors that the team considered while building the engine, as they wanted to ensure the highest possible quality for high-end games. Some of the environmental factors included lighting, shading and modeling. A core feature of the gameplay was the artificial intelligence (AI), which had previously been liable to become unstable or poor under certain conditions or with poor programming due to the large number of individual codes needed. For Luminous, the team created a single unifying flexible framework to control the scale of the AI while also making it intuitive. It was intended to be used in- house rather than licensed out to other developers, but that western subsidiaries of the company would have access to it. In addition, they also built in the ability to blend graphical assets designed for CG scenery with highly advanced real-time animation, making the two graphically similar. Luminous Studio was publicly revealed in 2011. The head of the project was Yoshihisa Hashimoto, Square Enix's Chief Technology Officer, who had moved over to the company from Sonic Team in 2009 and became involved with development in 2011. Other key Square Enix staff members working on Luminous Studio include Takeshi Nozue, Akira Iwata and Hiroshi Iwasaki. While ground work was being laid for Luminous, members of the team traveled to look at engine technology being developed by IO Interactive, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montr√©al, western video game developers who became subsidiaries after the company bought out Eidos Interactive. Square Enix's western subsidiaries shared information about game engine development from their experience developing the CDC and Glacier 2 game engines and shared their source code with the Luminous Studio team. During 2012, one third of the final development team was from western subsidiaries of the company. Luminous was developed based on high-end DirectX 11 technology. While designed for eighth-generation video games, it was said to also be compatible with any console and hardware that could handle shaders, such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Its compatibility with Nintendo's seventh-gen hardware such as the Wii and Nintendo 3DS was doubted, as those consoles did not support shaders. During this early stage, they were looking into the possibility of adjusting the engine for use on Wii U. The company were hoping to promote Luminous as a kind of brand, showing off the logo and tech demo when they were ready. Agni's Philosophy Preview of the gaming engine while editing after a showing of \\"Agni's Philosophy\\" at E3 in 2012 Agni's Philosophy is a tech demo created by Square Enix to show off the capacities of Luminous Studio. The demo was a collaboration between the cinematic Visual Works division‚Äîa section of the company generally associated with CGI movie production for the company's video games‚Äîand Square Enix's R&D; department, Advanced Technology Division, with a goal to create a real-time graphics tech demo that has a quality coming as close as possible to pre-rendered CGI. Development of the demo took approximately half a year. Unlike previous technology demos created by the company, which were based on pre-existing games, Square Enix decided to create something completely original. The demo was themed around the Final Fantasy series: during discussions, the team asked the question \\"What is Final Fantasy?\\", broke down its basic components and used them, along with added unusual elements, in the demo. A focus during the demo's development was the creation of Agni, the central character. For the demo, as it was a work-in- progress, they optimized it for graphical performance. While the story and themes were created by the Japanese staff, many of the character designs were done by staff from their western subsidiaries. The technology to create the demo was all sourced from then-existing high-end PCs. An initial mock up of Agni's hair was created using a mannequin and wig styled by a professional make-up artist. Each character's face was constructed around mo-capped footage of live actors, then tweaked and expanded in post-production. The entire development process, from conception through development, took approximately a year. Agni's Philosophy was first shown at E3 2012 as part of a special presentation by Square Enix. As part of the presentation, guest speakers paused the demo and adjusted elements of the characters on the fly to show off the engine's customization features. It was also shown at SIGGRAPH 2012. The Agni's Philosophy tech demo was running at 60 frames per second, used 1.8 GB of texture data per frame, and pushed ten million polygons per frame, with approximately 300,000 to 400,000 polygons for each character model. There is a scene where 100,000 illuminated firefly-like insects appear on screen, each one a full polygon mesh model with body and wings, which proceed to merge to generate a summoned monster. Production for the demo began in June 2011, and was initially produced as pre-rendered CGI animation by Visual Works before Square Enix attempted to reproduce it entirely in real-time with the Luminous Studio engine, using the same assets as the CGI version. Final Fantasy XV Prior to its rebranding from Final Fantasy Versus XIII and full move onto eighth-generation consoles, Final Fantasy XV used lighting technology from Luminous along with a purpose-built proprietary gameplay engine. For its E3 2013 re-reveal under its new title, the company used a specially-created engine environment named Ebony. In July 2014, Hashimoto left the company, citing personal reasons. While still working as an advisor for Luminous Studio, his position as project leader was filled by Remi Driancourt, a senior engineer who had worked with games featuring Luminous technology. The version of XV shown off at Tokyo Game Show and Jump Festa that year ran on Luminous 1.4, which combined Luminous with components created for Ebony. The Episode Duscae game demo ran on version 1.5, and the developers plan for the final game to run on version 2.0. With Luminous Studio, real-time scenes in XV have five million polygons per frame, with character models made up of about 100,000 polygons each. Character models for XV were constructed with 600 bones, estimated as roughly 10-12 times more than seventh generation hardware. About 150 bones are used for the face, 300 for the hair and clothes, and 150 for the body. For the characters' hair, the team used the same technique as with the characters in Agni's Philosophy. The inner hair for each character uses about 20,000 polygons, five times more than seventh generation hardware. The data capacity for textures is also much greater than before. Each character uses 30 MB of texture data, and ten levels of detail. While seventh- generation games used 50 to 100 MB of texture data for a scene, Final Fantasy XV can use about sixteen times this amount on the PlayStation 4 console. 2048√ó2048 and 4096√ó4096 texels are used for the HD textures. For the Microsoft Windows port, Luminous Studio was upgraded using technology from Nvidia. Witch Chapter 0 In April 2015, Square Enix announced that the engine would support DirectX 12, and Nvidia revealed a new real-time tech demo developed by Square Enix for the engine, called Witch Chapter 0 [cry], featuring the character Agni from the earlier Agni's Philosophy demo. The demo renders over 63 million polygons per frame, uses \\"8K by 8K\\" resolution textures, and her hair is rendered with over 50 shaders, with each strand of hair rendered as a polygon. It also portrays human crying with a high level of detail, and the quality of the real-time graphics have been compared to pre- rendered CGI animation. The tech demo took a year to produce, and was running on a PC with four GeForce GTX Titan X graphics cards. In October 2016, Square Enix registered for the trademark ‚ÄúLuminous Studio Pro‚Äù before the release of Final Fantasy XV. Features Reception The existence of the gaming engine surprised many critics when it was unveiled in E3 2012. Kotaku described the graphics of the game engine preview as \\"jaw dropping\\" and \\"stunning\\", and called it a real competitor to Unreal Engine 4. VG24/7 called the graphics \\"drop dead gorgeous\\". IGN cited the technology as a \\"hurdling leap into the future\\", and other reviews emphasised realistic 3D modeling of the human eye and real time rendering of graphics.

The current 16,421 square foot facility was built by the General Services Administration in 1986, and was named for Inspector Kenneth Ward, who was shot and killed while conducting an inspection at this crossing in 1979. The roads leading to the border crossing continue south as Washington State Route 539 to Lynden and Bellingham and north as British Columbia Highway 13 towards Aldergrove. History Recent improvements On August 10, 2016, the federal and provincial governments committed $25.5 million to widen Highway 13 (from two to five lanes) from 8th Avenue to 0 Avenue to accommodate new commercial facility, reducing delays at border crossings as well as building a new two lane east-west connection at 3B Avenue from Highway 13 to 264th Street.Widening of Hwy 13 to Complement New Aldergrove Commercial Facility Work officially started in Summer 2018Construction of three new lanes at Aldergrove border crossing begins with the south section completed on December 9, 2019 with the remaining highway work expected to be completed by spring 2020.Progress continues on Highway 13 upgrades See also * List of Canada‚ÄìUnited States border crossings References Category:Canada‚ÄìUnited States border crossings Category:1889 establishments in British Columbia Category:1889 establishments in Washington (state) Category:Buildings and structures in Whatcom County, Washington ","title":"Lynden‚ÄìAldergrove Border Crossing"},{"id":"44821580","text":"Bunmi Makinwa (born 1955) is the Chief Executive Officer of AUNIQUEI, a private entrepreneurial initiative in communication for leadership.

He also served four terms as chairman (de facto mayor) of the Portland, Maine City Council in 1924, 1927, 1934 and 1935. Biography He was born in 1878 in Maine. Deering served on the State Highway Commission for seven years, including a year as Chair. In 1923, Portland voters dramatically altered the city charter, which included eliminated the previously elected mayor position and by cutting the number of City Councilors from 27 common council members and 9 alderman to 5 at-large members. The election was heavily supported by 'native' residents from the previous neighborhoods of Deering, Maine. There was a strong ethnic conflict in the election, with the 'Committee of 100', of which Deering was a member, made up of 99 Protestants and 1 Catholic but no Jewish or African- American residents. Deering was elected subsequently elected in a citywide as the top vote-getter. The new council chose as the first chairman of the City Council, which he held twice during his first term in office.

It is approximately long and flows through Sugarloaf Township. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The stream's headwaters are located between Red Rock Mountain and Central Mountain. It has no named tributaries, but one unnamed tributary. Chimneystack Run is named after Chimneystack Rock. Wild trout inhabit the stream. Glaciation has affected the geography and geology in its vicinity. Course Chimneystack Run begins in a deep valley between Central Mountain and Red Rock Mountain in northern Sugarloaf Township, slightly more than south of the Columbia County/Sullivan County line. It flows east- southeast for a few tenths of a mile and its valley deepens. The stream then turns south for a similar distance before turning east-southeast. Its valley becomes significantly shallower at this point. After a few tenths of a mile, it leaves its valley altogether, turning south-southeast and flowing down Central Mountain. After several tenths of a mile, the stream receives an unnamed tributary from the left. A short distance later, it reaches its confluence with Coles Creek. Chimneystack Run joins Coles Creek upstream of its mouth. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Chimneystack Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. The headwaters of Chimneystack Run are on a saddle between Central Mountain and the westernmost portion of Red Rock Mountain. During a period of glaciation an ice lobe at the headwaters of Chimneystack Run nearly split the western part of a nunatak on Central Mountain and Red Rock Mountain. There are abandoned glacial meltwater channels near the stream's headwaters. Some bedrock ledge outcrops are present in the upper reaches of the watershed. For most of its lower reaches, Chimneystack Run flows over a glacial till known as the Wisconsinan Bouldery Till. It is also present near the headwaters of the stream. Boulder colluvium and a glacial till known as the Wisconsinan Till occur along the stream's middle reaches. Most of the till in the vicinity of the creek is expected to be more than thick. The surface in these areas contains cobbles and boulders made of quartz, sandstone, and conglomerate. In the stream's upper reaches, the bedrock contains red and gray sandstone and shale. The bedrock underlies red- brown to yellow-brown diamict that contains clayey silt and sandy silt. Watershed The watershed of Chimneystack Run has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Red Rock. It is located in the northeastern part of Sugarloaf Township. History and etymology Chimneystack Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1171790. Chimneystack Run is named after Chimneystack Rock, a sandstone rock on Central Mountain. The rock itself is named for its resemblance to a chimneystack. Biology Wild trout naturally reproduce in Chimneystack Run. The 1977 Columbia County Natural Resource Inventory states that the stream is an \\"excellent\\" stream for trout fishing.

He was a seven-time United States champion and briefly held the indoor world record in men's weight throw. Biography Like his fellow hammer thrower Don Favor, Irving Folwartshny was an alumnus of Deering High School in Portland, Maine. Subsequently, he studied at Rhode Island State College, where Fred Tootell, 1924 Olympic hammer throw champion, was track and field coach; Tootell's other pupils included Henry Dreyer and Bill Rowe, both of whom also became national hammer throw champions. Folwartshny placed fourth in the 35-lb weight throw at the 1935 national indoor championships, but his breakthrough year was 1936, his sophomore year at Rhode Island, when his results improved rapidly. At the 1936 indoor championships he won the weight throw with a heave of 58 ft in (17.71 m), defeating Dreyer and Pete Zaremba and breaking Dreyer's world record by four and a half inches; as a world record Folwartshny's throw was short-lived, as Dreyer threw 58 ft in (17.79 m) only seven days later; but as a championship record it lasted until 1951. During the 1936 outdoor season Folwartshny repeatedly threw the hammer over 170 ft (51.81 m), smashing his 1935 best of 156 ft (47.55 m). He won the IC4A hammer championship with a throw of 172 ft in (52.66 m), ahead of Bates's Anton Kishon and Rowe. At the national championships Folwartshny threw 167 ft in (50.90 m) and took second behind Rowe; like his fellow Rhode Island throwers Rowe and Dreyer, he was one of the favorites to qualify for the American Olympic team. The Olympic Trials, however, were held separately from the national championships for the first time since 1924; at the Trials, Dreyer and Rowe took first and second, but the third and final Olympic spot went to Don Favor as Folwartshny only managed 157 ft in (47.93 m) and placed sixth. In 1937 Folwartshny won his second national indoor weight throw title with a throw of 57 ft in (17.49 m), again defeating Dreyer. He also won the IC4A indoor weight throw and successfully defended his outdoor IC4A hammer title. In addition, he became national (AAU) outdoor champion for the first time, throwing the hammer 173 ft in (52.92 m) and beating runner-up Bill Lynch by seven feet. In 1938 Folwartshny repeated as AAU and IC4A weight throw champion indoors and reached his peak as a hammer thrower outdoors. He won his third consecutive IC4A hammer title with a throw of 178 ft in (54.50 m), then the second-best mark in IC4A history behind his own coach, Fred Tootell, who had thrown 181 ft in (55.33 m) when he won in 1923. Folwartshny also repeated as AAU hammer champion, throwing 179 ft 3 in (54.63 m) in that meet; it was the best throw at the national championships since Pat Ryan's meeting record of 183 ft in (55.87 m) from 1914. After the American season Folwartshny toured Europe with a number of other athletes; he set his personal best of 56.17 m (184 ft in) in Osnabr√ºck on August 21, although he still only placed second to Germany's reigning Olympic champion Karl Hein. Like Dreyer before him, Folwartshny represented the New York Athletic Club after graduating from Rhode Island State. Dreyer dethroned him as indoor weight throw champion in 1939, and Folwartshny also lost his outdoor hammer title that year, only placing fourth with a throw of 169 ft in (51.75 m) as Chester Cruikshank won. Folwartshny never regained the weight throw championship, but did win the hammer title again in 1941, throwing 175 ft in (53.49 m) and defeating the previous year's champion, fellow Maine native Stanley Johnson, by almost three feet. Folwartshny anglicized his surname to Folsworth before the 1944 national indoor championships, where he took second behind Dreyer in the weight throw. As Folsworth, he won the AAU hammer title for a fourth and final time in 1946, throwing 169 ft 8 in (51.71 m); it was the eleventh consecutive time he had placed in the top four. The streak ended that year, however, as he no longer placed in 1947; Folsworth retired from competition before the 1948 season, not pursuing selection for the Olympics in London. Folsworth earned his living as a construction engineer, and as sales engineer and corporate vice president of Grinding Inc. in Connecticut. Size Despite his nickname \\"Shorty\\", Folwartshny was tall and bulky even by the standards of heavy throwers, and the press described him as a \\"giant\\". Listed as 6 ft 6 in (198 cm) and 225 lbs (102 kg) as a collegiate sophomore in 1936, Folwartshny continued to bulk up, weighing 262 lbs (119 kg) by 1947. The Association of Track and Field Statisticians gives his height as 200 cm (6 ft 7 in). Legacy Folsworth was inducted in the University of Rhode Island Athletic Hall of Fame in 1973, in the same class as Rowe and Dreyer, and in the Maine Sports Hall of Fame in 1981, in the same class as Favor.

Retrieved April 4th, 2019.  Research on labour supply Joseph Altonji's first field of research have been the economics of labour supply. In a seminal 1982 paper, he analysed whether aggregate fluctuations in (un-)employment can be explained as intertemporal substitution in labour supply, as hypothesized by e.g. Robert E. Lucas, and found the model to be rejected in the data.Altonji, J.G. (1982). The intertemporal substitution model of labour market fluctuations: An empirical analysis. Review of Economic Studies, 49(5), pp. 783-824. In another analysis of the sensitivity of the labour supply to intertemporal wage variation, Altonji uses either consumption data or a first- difference approach to control for wealth and wage expectations and finds the intertemporal elasticity of wage substitution for married men to be positive and small.Altonji, J.G. (1986). Intertemporal substitution in labor supply: Evidence from micro data. Journal of Political Economy, 94(3), pp. S176-S215. Further work on the labour supply was later produced in the 1990s with Christina Paxson, with whom Altonji found that the effects of changes in the demographic structure of the family on wives' work hours are generally much larger for wives who change employers, supporting the perspective that job changes following shifts in labour supply preferences (e.g. due to motherhood) may provide the opportunity to reduce discrepancies between desired and actual working hours.Altonji, J.G., Paxson, C.H. (1992). Labor supply, hours constraints, and job mobility. Journal of Human Resources, 27(2), pp. 256-278. In another study with Paxson on this topic, they find that workers require compensation to work in a job that, given the worker's particular preferences, offers unattractive working hours.Altonji, J.G., Paxson, C.H. (1998). Labor supply preferences, hours constraints, and hours-wage trade-offs. Journal of Labor Economics, 6(2), pp. 254-276.  Economics of education and training Some of Altonji's earliest work in the economics of education and training studied the effect of high school curricula. For instance, jointly with James Spletzer, he studied the link between the receipt of on-the-job training and the characteristics of workers and jobs in the U.S. in the 1970s, for which they found no relationship between high school curriculum and training, but instead - among else - a negative link between training intensity and duration, women to be more likely to receive training than men but overall receiving less training time, and post-secondary education to make subsequent training more probable.Altonji, J.G., Spletzer, J.R. (1991). Worker characteristics, job characteristics, and the receipt of on-the-job training. Industrial & Labor Relations Review, 45(1), pp. 58-79. Subsequent work on high school curricula by Altonji found the return to additional courses in academic subjects to be small.Altonji, J.G. (1995). The effects of high school curriculum on education and labor market outcomes. Journal of Human Resources, 30(3), pp. 409-438. Further research by Altonji on the demand for and return to high school and postsecondary by field of study is reviewed in his survey of the literature (co-authored with Erica Blom and Costas Meghir).Altonji, J.G., Blom, E., Meghir, C. (2012). Heterogeneity in human capital investments: High school curriculum, college major, and careers. Annual Review of Economics, 4(1), pp. 185-223. In two studies with Thomas Dunn using the PSID and NLS, Altonji finds that teachers' salary, expenditures per pupil and a composite index of school quality indicators have a substantial positive effect on the wages of U.S. high school graduates,Altonji, J.G., Dunn, T.A. (1996). Using siblings to estimate the effect of school quality on wages. Review of Economics and Statistics, 78(4), pp. 665-671. but mixed results regarding whether parental education has a positive impact on children's returns to education.Altonji, J.G., Dunn, T.A. (1996). The effects of family characteristics on the return to education. Review of Economics and Statistics, 78(4), pp. 692-704. Together with Todd Elder and Christopher Taber, Joseph Altonji has notably analysed the effect of attending a Catholic high school, finding that they substantially increase the likelihood of graduating from high school and possibly also of college attendance, though with scant effect on test scores.Altonji, J.G., Elder, T.E., Taber, C.R. (2005). Selection on observed and unobserved variables: Assessing the effectiveness of Catholic schools. Journal of Political Economy, 113(1), pp. 151-184. As part of this analysis, Altonji, Elder and Taber exploited a presumed link between selections on observed and on unobserved variables and later used their results to develop an assessment method for instrumental variable strategies.Altonji, J.G., Elder, T.E., Taber, C.R. (2005). An evaluation of instrumental variable strategies for estimating the effects of Catholic schooling. Journal of Human Resources, 40(4), pp. 791-821. Finally, although most of Altonji's return in education economics is empirical, he has also contributed to its theory, most importantly through his analysis of the demand for and return to education face to uncertain education outcomes.Altonji, J.G. (1993). The demand for and return to education when education outcomes are uncertain. Journal of Labor Economics, 11(1), pp. 48-83.  Research on family economics Another field of research of Altonji is the economic analysis of the family, especially in joint work with Laurence Kotlikoff and Fumio Hayashi as well as with Thomas Dunn. Together with Hayashi and Kotlikoff, Altonji finds that, within the extended family in the U.S., the distribution of consumption is independent of the distribution of resources, suggesting that members of an extended family are not altruistically linked.Altonji, J.G., Hayashi, F., Kotlikoff, L. (1992). Is the extended family altruistically linked? Direct tests using micro data. American Economic Review, 1177-1198. Exploring the effects of income and wealth on time and money transfers between parents and children further, they find that money transfers tend to reduce inequality in household incomes but that income differences poorly predict time transfers, with richer siblings giving more to parents and receive less; overall, the results call for more sophisticated exchange models of transfers.Altonji, J.G., Hayashi, F., Kotlikoff, L.J. (1996). The effects of income and wealth on time and money transfers between parents and children. NBER Working Paper Series, No. 5522. Another finding is that risk sharing between or within U.S. American families is incomplete.Hayashi, F., Altonji, J., Kotlikoff, L. (1996). Risk-Sharing Between and Within Families. Econometrica, pp. 261-294. In later work, Altonji, Hayashi and Kotlikoff renew their rejection of the altruism hypothesis, finding in their research on parental altruism and inter vivos transfers that redistributing one dollar from a recipient child to donor parents leads to a \\"trickle down\\" of only 13%, far less than what would be expected under altruism (100%).Altonji, J.G., Hayashi, F., Kotlikoff, L.J. (1997). Parental altruism and inter vivos transfers: Theory and evidence. Journal of Political Economy, 105(6), pp. 1121-1166. More recently, together with Dunn, Altonji has studied the relationships among the family incomes and labour market outcomes of relatives.Altonji, J.G., Dunn, T.A. (2012). Relationships among the family incomes and labor market outcomes of relatives. Research in Labor Economics, 35, pp. 761-802.  Research on discrimination and migration Altonji has also made substantial contributions to the field of labour market discrimination, especially through his comprehensive survey of the literature on race and gender in the labour market (with Rebecca Blank).Altonji, J.G., Blank, R.M. (1999). Race and gender in the labor market. In: Ashenfelter, O.C, Card, D. (eds.). Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 3. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 3143-3259. Another seminal study is due to Altonji and Charles Pierret, who show that if firms statistically discriminate among young workers on the basis of easily observable characteristics, the coefficients on the easily observed variables should fall and the coefficients on hard-to-observe correlates of productivity should rise, as firms learn about workers' productivity.Altonji, J.G., Pierret, C.R. (2001). Employer learning and statistical discrimination. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 116(1), pp. 313-350. More recently, in work with Ulrich Doraszelski, Altonji has studied the role of permanent income and demographics regarding the wealth differences between blacks and whites in the U.S.Altonji, J.G., Doraszelski, U. (2005). The role of permanent income and demographics in black/white differences in wealth. Journal of Human Resources, 40(1), pp. 1-30. Finally, besides his work on discrimination, Altonji has also analysed the effects of immigration on the labour outcomes of less-skilled natives in the U.S. (together with David Card), finding some evidence that less-skilled natives in high-immigrant cities have moved out of immigrant-intensive industries and that an inflow of immigrants equal to 1% may reduce the average weekly earnings of less-skilled natives by about 1.2%. Altonji, J.G., Card, D. (1991). The effects of immigration on the labor market outcomes of less- skilled natives. In: Abowd, J.M., Freeman, R.B. (eds.). Immigration, Trade, and the Labor market. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 201-234.  Research on wages, income and consumption  In his research on wages, Altonji and Robert Shakotko finds that wages rise modestly with job seniority and that general labour market experience and \\"job shopping\\" account for most wage growth over a career, with the strong cross-sectional relationship between tenure and wages being mainly due to heterogeneity bias.Altonji, J.G., Shakotko, R.A. (1987). Do wages rise with job seniority? Review of Economic Studies, 54(3), pp. 437-459. A 2005 reestimation by Altonji and Nicolas Williams yielded an estimate of 10 years of tenure increasing the log wage by 0.11, suggesting that the return to tenure has likely grown over time.Altonji, J.G., Williams, N. (2005). Do wages rise with job seniority? A reassessment. Industrial & Labor Relations Review, 58(3), pp. 370-397. In a paper with Aloysius Siow, Altonji tests the rational expectations lifecycle model of consumption against a Keynesian model and the rational expectations lifecycle model with imperfect capital markets, finding the evidence to reject the Keynesian model but yielding inconclusive results as to whether the assumption of perfect capital markets is necessary or not.Altonji, J.G., Siow, A. (1987). Testing the response of consumption to income changes with (noisy) panel data. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 102(2), pp. 293-328. In a study with Paul Devereux, Altonji studies to what extent nominanal wages are downwardly rigid and what effect such rigidities have on wage levels, wage changes, and labour market transitions.Altonji, J.G., Devereux, P.J. (2000). The extent and consequences of downward nominal wage rigidity. Research in Labor Economics, 383-431. Most recently, Altonji, Anthony Smith Jr. and Ivan Vidangos used indirect inference to estimate a joint model of earnings, employment, job changes, wage rates, and work hours over a career, finding that human capital is responsible for most of earnings growth over a career, though with important roles for job seniority and mobility, and that unemployment shocks have substantial impacts on earnings in both the short and long run.Altonji, J.G., Smith Jr, A.A., Vidangos, I. (2013). Modeling earnings dynamics. Econometrica, 81(4), pp. 1395-1454.  Other research Further major research by Altonji has addressed small-sample bias in GMM estimation of covariance structures (with Lewis Segal),Altonji, J.G., Segal, L.M. (1996).

Despite its lack of chart success, the song has since attracted positive critical reception.

The attack occurred on 30 November 2014. 341 prisoners escaped from the prison leaving 1 warder and 20 sniffer dogs dead. The escaped prisoners were largely awaiting trial. 10 inmates who attempted to escaped were captured during the attack at gunfire exchange between the policemen and the gunmen. 67 inmates were rearrested after the attack and 274 inmates escaped. One inmate, who claimed to have run away when he heard gunshots, returned to the prison to serve out his short sentence. Incident The incident was reported to have occurred on Sunday, 30 November 2014. Kehinde Fadipe, the comptroller general of the Nigerian Prisons Services, refuted the claims that the unknown gunmen were members of the Boko Haram, an Islamic sect in northeastern Nigeria, on the basis of the fact that none of their members was awaiting trial in that prison. On 1 December 2014, Ekiti State executive governor Ayodele Fayose accused prison officials of conspiring with the unknown gunmen to launch the attack. Reactions Initially the attack was linked with the Oduduwa People's Congress, alleged to be an attempt to unlawfully release Adeniyi Adedipe, the coordinator of the Oodua Peoples Congress in Ekiti State Chapter, who had been awaiting a trial.

Al-Jdayde (, also transliterated as al-Jdeideh, al-Judayda, al-Jde√Ød√© or al-Jadida) is a historic predominantly Christian neighbourhood of Aleppo. It is noted for its winding narrow alleys, richly decorated mansions and churches. It was an area of significant cultural and historical interest. Much of Al-Jdayde suffered catastrophic damage during the Syrian civil war. History Al-Jdayde shown in red as established outside walls of the ancient city, 1820s At the end of the Mamluk period, al-Jdayde was a small suburb benefiting from a few shops located outside of city's northern walls and near the cemeteries and storage areas. The development of the city along the roads connecting the Bab al-Nasr gate with neighbouring villages to the North and northeast progressively integrated Jdayde into the city of Aleppo.Hazzaz√© to the north-west, Ramadaniy√© to the north-east and Banqousa to the east By the late 14th century, these quarters were equipped with khutba mosques and fountains made possible by a network of water works. A new water duct, opened in 1490‚Äì91, facilitated the further extension of the Jdayde neighbourhood and the creation of its hammams.Sauvaget, Jean (1941) Alep, essai sur le d√©veloppement d‚Äôune grande ville syrienne des origines au milieu du XIXe si√®cle, texte et album, librairie orientaliste Paul Geuthner, Paris : Carte des canalisations mameloukes, p. 182. Christian cemeteries and probably also the remains of ancient churches of the Byzantine period are to be found in the West side of the al-Jdayde suburb. The earlier settlement of Salibeh in this ancient Christian sector, followed by the development of Jdayde, reflects the growth of the Christian population and its desire to reside together in specific areas.Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh (2004), The image of an Ottoman city: imperial architecture and urban experience in Aleppo in the 16th and 17th centuries, Leiden: EJ Brill, pp. 158-9 Most churches, newly built or enlarged, are found around Farhat Square next to the Salibeh intersection, notably, the Armenian Holy Forty Martyrs Church which was enlarged in 1490,Sauvaget (1941) p. 179. the Greek Orthodox, the Maronite and the Syriac churches. The neighbourhood was gradually settled by notables as well as less affluent residents.Churches and houses shared the same principle of discretion with an absence of facades shown on exterior elevations especially on the main streets. It seems that certain churches may have had their entrances at the end of cul-de-sacs. Character A characteristic 16th-century narrow alleyway of Al-Jdayde The Armenians, who specialized in trade with Persia and India, were the predominant inhabitants of Jdeideh. During the 16th and 17th centuries, following the Ottoman conquest, the neighbourhood was subdivided into rectangular land parcels.David, Jean-Claude. (1982) ¬´ Urbanisation spontan√©e et planification ¬ª Les cahiers de la recherche architecturale, n¬∞10-11. Two large Muslim waqfs (religious trusts), founded in 1583-90 and in 1653, have been in the heart of the area for centuries. These two architectural ensembles, with richly decorated facades and regular layout, hosted the majority of the commercial and social services for the neighbourhood, where Muslim and Christian, rich and poor, lived side by side. They included a fountain in front of the Christian quarter, a caf√©, a large hammam, a small mosque and a school for Muslim pupils, a cloth market, four large textile workshops,The three qaysariya du waqf Ipchir Pacha have been held more than eighty textile operations each with two to four looms thus possibly hosted more than 250 craftsmen at the peak of activities in the area. a vast cereal warehouse, and various souks for food and local services.David, Jean-Claude, (2004) ¬´ La production de l‚Äôespace dans la ville ottomane ¬ª Les relations entre musulmans et chr√©tiens dans le Bilad al-Cham, p. 178‚Äì179. Here numbers of locals and dragomen would, with the encouragement of various sultans, assist foreign merchants conduct their trade in Aleppo. Revitalisation Beit Ghazaleh; an example of renovation in al-Jdayde In 1990‚Äì2000, al-Jdayde‚Äînoted for its winding narrow alleys, richly decorated mansions and churches‚Äîbecame an area of significant cultural, historical and tourist interest for national and international visitors.Stefano Bianca, Peter Davies, Wolfgang F√ºlscher (1981-3) The Re-development of the Bab Al-Faraj Area in Aleppo, UNESCO PARIS p. 9 (36) An ever-present scent of flowers, especially Jasmin, was said to permeate the area. Many of the neighbourhood's historic palaces were revitalised as museums, boutique hotels and restaurants. Some of the most important historic buildings of the al-Jdayde quarter include: Beit Wakil, Beit Ghazaleh, Dar Zamaria, Beit Achiqbash, Beit Sader, Beit Sissi, Dar Basile and Beit Dallal. Jdayde's two squares, Sahat Farhat and Sahat Al Hatab were also renovated during this period. Recent Developments Al-Jdayde suffered major damage resulting from rebel undermining in April 2015 Much of al-Jdayde suffered catastrophic damage during the Syrian civil war which began in Aleppo in 2012. The area found itself on the front line of a four-year war of attrition between combatant forces.Ministry of Culture Directorate General of Antiquities & Museums (2017) STATE PARTY REPORT On The State of Conservation of The Syrian Cultural Heritage Sites (Syrian Arab Republic), 1 February 2017, available on https://whc.unesco.org/document/155953 In particular, a series of huge underground explosions conducted by the armed opposition under Sahat Al Hatab in April 2015 devastated the neighbourhood. A number of monuments, museums, churches including Beit Ghazaleh, Beit Achiqbash and the Waqf of Ibshir Mustafa Pasha, were heavily damaged by fighting. Furthermore, numerous buildings were stripped of their fixtures and fittings and ancient decorations looted. A collaborative high precision survey of various monuments in the zone were completed in November 2017 by the DGAM and UNESCO to facilitate their protection and emergency consolidation. The process of the rehabilitation of Sahat al Hatab, which began with back-filling of craters in 2017, continued with rubble clearance in 2018.

United States v. Banki case In January 2010, Banki was arrested and prosecuted by the United States Attorney's office in New York City. He was charged with violating US sanctions against Iran. He spent 22 months in prison before winning his case on appeal in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, with all the sanctions charges against him being dismissed. Case background Banki's family lived in Iran and through the early 2000s with his parents' marriage was falling apart, the family decided to send a portion of the family assets to the US.\\"To Defendant, a U.S. Success Story; to Prosecutors, a Money Broker to Iran\\" by Benjamin Weiser, New York Times, May 12, 2010 Between 2006 and 2009 Banki's family sent proceeds of his parents' divorce settlement (approximately $3.4 million) to him, from Iran to the US. The money came into a single bank account at Bank of America, over multiple transfers through an informal money transfer systems which the defendant argued was legal and the only means of sending money out of Iran at the time. Banki used the majority of this money to purchase an apartment in downtown Manhattan. Prosecutors argued that over this three-year period Banki had violated the sanctions imposed by the US on Iran. The indictment accused Banki of violating the sanctions law, running an informal underground bank, and helping \\"manage, supervise, operate, and conduct\\" an unlicensed money transmittal service through which he directly or indirectly facilitated and violated the Iran sanctions. In essence, the charges against Banki stemmed from prosecution allegations that he, as an American citizen, had violated US sanctions on Iran. Sanctions history The United States enforces sanctions against several countries worldwide.\\"United States Embargoes\\" These sanctions are instituted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) under the Department of Treasury of the United States. US treasury's OFAC designates family money as exempt from the sanctions law.\\"What you need to know about U.S. Economic Sanctions\\", by U.S. Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control A detailed letter by former head of Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Richard Newcomb, to the court during the case of US v. Banki outlined the sanctions regiment and intent; undermining the prosecutor's case against Banki as not being in line with the practices of OFAC or the intent of the sanctions. Nor were the charges in line with the agency's approach while Richard Newcomb was head of the agency: \\"The underlying purpose for these multiple U.S. economic sanctions programs against Iran was to target the Government with the use of economic methods to change the behavior of the leadership in Iran toward the United States and the international community at large, and to thwart Iran's support for and funding of terrorism, its efforts to disrupt the Middle East Peace Process and its development of weapons of mass destruction. Central to the effort was to direct and focus the sanctions impact on the Government of Iran, its leadership, its various agencies, instrumentalities, controlled entities and support structure, including Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, and other such organizations necessary for the support and continuation of the current Governmental hierarchy. The industrial and commercial sectors - oil and gas, financial, manufacturing and other sectors that contribute significantly to Iran's economy and the Government's ability to continue its threatening behavior were also of primary concern. The program goal was never intended to target the Iranian people. The Iranian Diaspora is large. As many as 4 million or more Iranians live as expats around the world. It is estimated that there are as many as 800,000 Iranian nationals currently resident in the United States as dual nationals, green card holders or with other visa status. A very large percentage are supporters of U.S. policy toward Iran, and it is the goal of the U.S. government to continue cultivating that support while isolating the government of Iran. In virtually all economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC (with the exception of the. 1963 program against Cuba where Cuban nationals were also included as targets), including the Iran sanctions program, it was always understood that there was a dual goal and purpose - to bring as much economic pressure as possible to bear on the intended target without causing unintended hardship and suffering on the civilian population, the very people whose support and assistance the U.S. and the international community will need if and when a successor government emerges.\\"Former Head of OFAC's letter in support of Mahmoud Reza Banki Arrest, indictment and charges On January 7th, 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents authorized by a grand jury with a search and arrest warrant entered the residence of Mahmoud Reza Banki in New York City and arrested him.\\"Manhattan U.S. Attorney Charges Management Consultant For Criminal Violations Of Iran Trade Embargo\\", January 7, 2010 He was arraigned before Judge John F. Keenan on an indictment charging him with three counts: 1. Conspiracy to violate the U.S.-imposed Iran sanctions and conspiracy to run an unlicensed money transmittal system, 2. Violation of the Iran sanctions, and 3. Running of an unlicensed money transmittal business.Indictment against Mahmoud Reza Banki The indictment accused Banki of receiving $4.7 million in violation of the Iran sanctions. Prosecutors filed a superseding indictment later changing the amount to $3.4 million and adding two false statement charges to the three initial charges.Superseding Indictment against Mahmoud Reza Banki Banki was denied bail despite multiple attempts.\\"NYC consultant denied bail in Iran trade case\\", by Larry Neumeister, Associated Press, Jan 21, 2010 He was held in high and maximum security Incarceration in the United States Security Levels detention facilities pending trial. Judge John F. Keenan asserted that there was \\"no combination of conditions would ensure Banki's appearance in court\\" and denied bail multiple times despite securing guarantees of millions of dollars in bond. Nine attorneys and close friends volunteered to put up their homes as collateral on Banki's behalf for his bail package. But the judge did not see any monetary amount that could satisfy the bail conditions in his opinion. Trial at the District Court and forfeiture The indictment charging Banki argued that Banki should have gotten authorization in the form of a license for the money he received: \\"(vi) Under the ITR, any United States person who wishes to engage in a transaction otherwise prohibited by the ITR must first file an application for a license and receive approval from OFAC. 31 C.F.R. ¬ß¬ß 56.600, 560.501, and 501.801.\\". Banki did not have a license for the money he received. Judge John F. Keenan denied the Banki's defense request to instruct the jury on the law that specifically permits family money as an exception to the sanctions law, permitting such transfers without the need for a license: \\"However, U.S. depository institutions are permitted to handle funds transfers, through intermediary third-country banks, to or from Iran or for the direct or indirect benefit of the Government of Iran or a person in Iran, arising from several types of underlying transactions, including: a) a noncommercial family remittance; b) an exportation to Iran or importation from Iran of information and informational materials; c) a travel-related remittance; d) a payment for the shipment of a donation of articles to relieve human suffering; or e) a transaction authorized by OFAC through a specific or general license.\\". On May 10, 2010 a three-week trial commenced where Second Circuit District judge John F. Keenan presided. The trial concluded on June 4 when the jury returned a guilty verdict on all five counts, albeit, guilty on a lesser charge of aiding and abetting rather than running a sanctions violation money transmittal system.\\"Immigrant Convicted of Violating Iran Embargo\\", by Benjamin Weiser, New York Times, June 4, 2010 On June 7, 2010, despite the superseding indictment charge of $3.4 million, the same jury agreed to forfeit one bank account associated with a $6,000 transaction as the proceeds of the charges and the guilty verdict. The jury ruled that Mahmoud Reza Banki's other assets including the apartment he had purchased with the family funds he had received was not a direct proceed of any crime and not forfeitable. Judge John F. Keenan overruled the jury only in the case of the forfeiture verdict on the basis that the jury might have been \\"confused\\" and awarded the government prosecutors a money judgment order, essentially ignoring the jury verdict on forfeiture and awarding the US Attorney's office $3.4 million, to be paid by Banki.Court transcript: Case: 10-3381; Southern District of New York This would have been the same as if the jury had come to the decision of full forfeiture of all of Banki's assets. The defense objections throughout trial were overruled. One such overruling was the judge's decision not to allow for jury instructions on the family money exception from the sanctions law. Essentially, the jury was not told that transfer of family money is legal; that family money can be sent to and received from Iran and is an exception in the US sanctions law against Iran. This would become a material issue at the appellate level and the primary reason for the reversal of the charges. Judge Keenan also did not allow the defense to call Richard Newcomb, former head of OFAC, to testify as an expert witness on the sanctions charges despite his qualifications: he had been head of OFAC for 17 years (from 1987 to 2004), where he was the author of the sanctions law. Richard Newcomb was not only the author of the underlying sanctions regulations but in his capacity as head of OFAC he had also been in charge of enforcing the sanctions law not just against Iran but all countries US had sanctions against. Sentencing and imprisonment During sentencing, over 120 letters of support were sent to Judge Keenan to ask for leniency. Among those were letters from Nobel Peace Laureate Shirin Ebadi and ex- Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Richard Newcomb. In a lengthy letter, Richard Newcomb made the case for Banki's innocence of the sanctions charges and highlighted that through Newcomb's administration of the sanctions program in the US the program was \\"never intended to target the Iranian people\\" and that \\"the Iranian-American community commonly and openly uses remittance forwarding service providers, including hawalas to move family funds back and forth between the United States and Iran, typically with no penalty, civil or criminal.\\"\\"IABA And Partner Organizations File Amicus Brief in United States v. Banki\\" Iranian American Bar Association On August 16, 2010, Judge Keenan sentenced Banki to 30 months in prison.\\"Man Gets 2 ¬Ω Years for Breaking Iran Embargo\\" by Benjamin Weiser, New York Times, August 16, 2010 Shortly after being sentenced Banki filed for appeal. The Iranian American Bar Association along with 10 other advocacy and civil rights groups filed a separate amicus brief with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The brief argued that U.S.-Iran sanctions \\"are not aimed at the Iranian people, and therefore they contain exemptions permitting certain humanitarian transactions and family remittances.\\"Brief of Amici Curiae In Support of Defendant-Appellant Mahmoud Reza Banki For about 11 months (from January 7, 2010 through December 1, 2010) Banki was held in high and maximum security detention centers in Manhattan and Brooklyn (MCC and MDC).Bureau of Prisons Facilities For the month of December in 2010, Banki was transferred to the Taft Correctional Institute's deportation prison outside of Bakersfield in California. In January 2011, Banki was transferred to the lower security Taft prison where he remained pending the appellate decision. Upon release Banki had served 665 days, nearly 22 months in prison. Appellate reversal On October 24, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in favor of Banki and reversed the sanctions charges against him. Judge Keenan's court ordered Banki's release 10 days later on November 2, 2011.\\"2nd Circ. Nixes Conviction For Iran Money Transfer System\\" By Abigail Rubenstein Law360 October 24, 2011 Appellate court ruled that Judge John F. Keenan had erred at trial; in denying Banki's defense request to instruct the jury on the law that specifically exempts family money as an exception to the sanctions law, permitting such transfers without the need for a license. The final appellate court brief stated: \\"Banki's conviction [on the sanctions charges] cannot stand\\".US Court of Appeals Decision Prosecutors reopened the case to pursue a retrial in February 2012. However, after a few months of delay and assignment of a new judge, the case was closed criminally with no option for future civil or criminal prosecution. Rather than pay for the high cost of a second criminal defense trial, Banki agreed to relinquish $710k of his assets. In exchange, prosecutors agreed that Banki was not guilty of the sanctions charges without going through a second trial and that they would end pursuing the case further in criminal or civil courts. The case was permanently closed on July 24, 2012 with the final word being Banki's appellate win and that Banki was not guilty of the sanctions charges for which he had been arrested and for which he served 22 months in prison. In the final court hearing, Banki's prison record was cleared. During the hearing Banki said he had lived through \\"the darkest hours\\" of his life while in prison. \\"I watched my life pass me by. Those days will never be replaced\\". Judge Engelmayer in clearing Banki's prison record called him a \\"talented man, even brilliant\\".\\"Banki told debt to society overpaid\\" Iran Times The judge also stated: \\". . . the damage to Mr. Banki's life brought about by his lengthy incarceration, occasioned by his confinement, cannot be measured only by the 22 months in which he lost his liberty and which he cannot get back\\". Aftermath Since his release, Banki has completed a Masters' in Business Administration from UCLA Anderson School of Management. Banki spoke about his case for the first time publicly at a TED Conference at UCLA in 2014 in an effort to raise awareness about the justice system. He also spoke about the uncertain life path he now faces in the US and the difficulty he faces in finding employment due to his continued status as a felon despite his appellate win. There are plans for a documentary of his story.

It was named after the GhazalehAccording to the transcripts and genealogical lines of the family, the name can be found spelt in different ways: Gazal√©, ƒ†azaleh, Gazale, Ghazaleh. The Ghazaleh were prominent Aleppine merchant bankers and traders. family that owned it for about two centuries.The oldest parts of the house are at least 350 years old. Since 1914, it was used as a public schoolIt was first converted into a German and then an Armenian school (Haigazian Varjaran). and was recently restored to host the Memory Museum of the city of Aleppo. Beit Ghazaleh is located in the Al-Jdayde district of Aleppo.Transliteration. The neighbourhood has been recorded as Al-Jdaydeh, Al-Jdeideh, Al-Judayde, Al- Jde√Ød√©, Al-Judayda, from the Arabic ÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØÿ©.  History: the origins of the ƒ†azaleh House in Aleppo  Example of the ornate windows of Beit Ghazaleh The house is located on the Western edge of a large suburb inhabited by a multi- religious and multi-ethnic population. This neighbourhood to the North of the old city of Aleppo developed since the late Mameluke period. This area became the Christian quarter of Jdeideh which was organically clustered around its churches. Here lived the notables of Aleppo's Christian communities, notably the Armenians who specialised in trade with India and Persia. The ƒ†azaleh House was built in front of two large Muslim waqfs ‚Äî created in 1583-90 and 1653 ‚Äî and together they form the monumental heart of a lively mixed Christian-Muslim neighbourhood.See Jdayde's Waqf of Ibshir Mustafa Pasha for further information. Unique for its size and decor, Beit Ghazaleh embodies the wealth and power of the Christian community in 17th century Aleppo. The decorative panels of Beit Ghazaleh do not include human figure representations; made by local craftsmen, the panels display many painted inscriptions presenting a mix of popular sayings, mystic poetryTheir authors were either Muslim or Christian. and biblical psalms. This diversity of sources underlines the rich Arab culture and the eclecticism typical of Aleppo urban √©lites.  A palace built around many courtyards  The six courtyards of Beit Ghazaleh (RC Heritage) Throughout the centuries, the mansion's footprint expanded or contracted according to changing needs and fortunes. However, it always maintained a main central courtyard of 250m2. At its apex, the house covered an area of approximately 1,600m2, with 570m2 occupied by six courtyards. The actual size of the complex is practically invisible from the outside. The present entrance was opened in the 19th century on the main street on the house‚Äôs East side. This entrance leads to the principal courtyard, the focal centre and the main thoroughfare to the rest of the house. Polychrome marble tiles, forming a \\"carpet\\" in front of the iwan, precede the great fountain in the courtyard, with its games of water, stone basins and cascades. The fine wall decorations in the courtyard are said to have been carved by the Armenian sculptor Khachadur Bali a member of the Balyan family of Ottoman court architects.  The iwan  ƒ†azaleh House Iwan in Aleppo (Postcard 1918-1922) A North-South axis cuts through the whole house underlining the importance of the iwan from where it originates. This line divides the courtyard's paving, basin and garden into a precise geometry. The rest of the space is organized according to the needs of the household and the shape of the plot without concern for symmetry. All around the main courtyard, windows and doors punctuate the facades. Above these openings, the relative intricacy of the low relief decor surrounding them establishes the hierarchy of the rooms with the iwan at its summit. The stone decor of the iwan facade and of its annexes likely dates from the mid-17th century. The painted wooden panels of the qubbaThis Arabic term generally designates a dome which may indicate a funereal function. In the local arab architecture of the Near East (Syria) an iwan is almost always built between two quabba (qubbatayn) the access to which is generally regulated by the iwan and therefore are like \\"alcoves\\" (ai-qubba). They can be covered by a cupola or a wood ceiling. and the surviving panels of the iwan are likely dated from the same period. The iwan, first meant to provide comfort from the summer heat,The iwan is rather an airy space for the cool early hours of summer days or sunny periods during the winter and are open to the north in Syria. is thus the \\"centre\\" of the house and plays an essential symbolic role representing the power of the master of Beit Ghazaleh.  Rooms around the central courtyard  One of the interiors of the Ghazaleh House The five rectangular rooms accessible from the courtyard were once decorated with woodwork that has now almost entirely disappeared. The sixth room to the West is a vast T-shaped qa'a,In domestic arab architecture (notably in Syria and Egypt), this term designates a principal room, by its dimensions, the richness of its decor and its relative importance in the building. This room is generally multifunctional and often centrally located and remarkable by the extent of its architecture. indicative of wealth and power.  The North facade  North facade of the ƒ†azaleh House Opposite the iwan, the North fa√ßade dates from the end of the 17th century. It is remarkable for its lavish decor, unique in Aleppo. In the centre, the ablaqPolychrome elements presented in horizontal bands emphasizes the strict symmetry of the facade, while the interior spaces do not follow the same organization. According to an inscription, the large room in the East Wing dates from 1691. Its rich interior decoration, partially refurbished in the 19th century, includes four distinct sets of inscriptions: * Psalm 91Often quoted to express confidence in God the protector of the Bible on the ceiling cornice; * Popular sayings on the cornice of the wooden panelling; * The fifteen transom panels above the openings reproduce a poem by Ab√ª al-Fath al- Bust√ÆNotable Arabian poet. See this reference for further information addressing the themes of the condemnation of excess and unnecessary, reflections on human relationships, the need for God's help, and the need to be in control of one's body and improve one's heart and mind; * The inscriptions above the niches on the North side reproduce the verses of al- Mutanabbi on honour, wisdom and ignorance.  The floors  Ghazaleh House floors prior to renovation The floor of the iwan, and of some other rooms, has retained its old split-level organization. The spaces where you stand and circulate, the corridors and the ataba-s,The term gives the idea of entrance, of transitions and of the edge of a room and its rather specific Syrian use (durqa‚Äôa in Egypt). The atabe is mainly characterised by the low level of its floor close to that of the exterior of the room and about forty centimetres lower than that of the room. One can stand upright and deposit ones shoes before getting installed on the ground at the upper part of the room. are roughly at the same level as the courtyard. The rest of each room, covered with mats and rugs, is about 50 centimetres higher. The line of sight and the height of cushions determine the height of the sills and windows and thus the internal and external organization of the facades.  The hammam  Ghazaleh House hammam interior The hammam steam bath in the northwest corner is comparable to a public bath, but presents a simplified plan because the vast 'q√¢‚Äòa' served as a dressing room and resting space before and after bathing. Kitchens and other service quarters, stables, granaries and warehouses for provisions were likely situated to the North-east and South of the house, accessible from the alleys that surround the plot to the house's North and the South.  The West wing (the Q√¢‚Äòa)  The grand q√¢‚Äòa of Beit Ghazaleh The southwest corner of the courtyard, and the West wing, was completely rebuilt in 1737. It includes three key elements: a very large rectangular room with a fireplace, a large 'q√¢‚Äòa' and a hammam. The T-shaped 'q√¢‚Äòa' includes three iwan-s with wooden ceilings framing a ataba with a small octagonal basin in the centre, covered with a dome. The fourth facade of the ataba opens towards the central courtyard. Its interior decor includes stone tiles with geometric patterns and wooden panels painted with cups and fruit bouquets in vases. The 'q√¢‚Äòa' has two sets of inscriptions. The poem calligraphy on transoms (in praise of the Master of the House) begins with a discourse on wine. It ends with a dedication and the name of Jirjis along with a date of 1737. Inscriptions on the ceilings offer praise to the Virgin and include a poem of love typical of Sufi mystic texts.  The 19th century additions  The main entrance to the Maison Ghazaleh Significant changes were made to Beit Ghazaleh during the nineteenth century. Notably, rooms were added on the top of the North wing (dated 1880 by an inscription). A new Southern entrance to the impasse Chtamm√¢ was built, dated 1304/1887. These major redevelopments were inspired by the appearance of consular apartments in the Aleppo urban caravanseraisFor further information please see the entry for the Al-Madina Souq of Aleppo and by the architecture of embassies in the capital Istanbul.  Loss, looting and destruction  Beit Ghazaleh survey photograph of November 2017 During the nineteenth century, changes in the domestic lifestyle and the introduction of Western furniture ultimately led to aristocratic families abandoning houses such as Beit Ghazaleh. The transformation of the Ghazaleh House into a school was a factor for both its destruction and its preservation. While it allowed the preservation of the physical structure of the building, it also favoured the \\"disappearance\\" of a great deal of its decoration.TARAZI, Camille INGEA, Tania (2015) Vitrine de l‚ÄôOrient : Maison Tarazi, fond√©e √† Beyrouth en 1862, Beyrouth:DE LA REVUE PHENICIENNE , p.202; see also Ghazaleh House panels in the collection of the Robert Mouwad Museum in Beyrouth Sections of the house's exceptional wooden decorative panels were still in place prior to the Syrian civil war. By the time of its restoration in 2011, a number of pieces had been lost, dismembered or sold to individuals or to museums.UNESCO (2014) Safeguarding Syrian Cultural Heritage/Ghazaleh House, Accessed via http://www.unesco.org/new/en/safeguarding-syrian-cultural- heritage/ghazaleh-house on 15 August 2014. Since then the Ghazaleh house, especially its iwan, suffered catastrophic damage during the Syrian civil war. The property was effected by various explosions from house-to-house combat. Prior to this, all the remaining wooden decorative panels, with the exception of a few ceilings, were also removed (now confirmed looted). A file regarding the looting of the decorative panels was submitted \\"to Interpol and the International Council of Museums in the hope that the panels resurface on the art market and can be returned\\" to the museum.  Recent studies and restoration works  Video extract of high precision 3D laser scanner survey of Beit Ghazaleh of November 2017 (UNESCO, DGAM & AGP) From 2007 to 2011, the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums (DGAM) conducted a major campaign of restoration to transform Beit Ghazaleh into a museum dedicated to the memory of the city of Aleppo. Restoration work notably concerned the renovation of part of the decorative panels by Damascene craftsmen. In parallel, descendants of the Ghazaleh family launched a scientific study of the House. This study, which began in 2009, includes a historical research on the neighbourhood and of the house, a stylistic analysis of its decorative elements, and a detailed architectural survey. The study aimed to establish a precise chronology of Beit Ghazaleh's evolution since its inception. A collaborative high precision survey of Beit Ghazaleh was completed in November 2017 by the DGAM and UNESCO to facilitate the further study, protection and emergency consolidation of its structure. Further reports have been issued regarding damage to the property and looting of its decorative panels.

The significant repercussions of this act were felt throughout the county of Ayrshire and beyond. The spelling 'Montgomerie' is used throughout for both the family and Montgomery for the clan and clan and district names 'Cunninghame' in the same fashion. Historical background The Baillieship of Cunninghame had long been in the hands of the Cunninghames, Earls of Glencairn, however at around the date 1448 the Crown conferred the Baillieship on the head of the House of Montgomerie (de Mon' Gubri), Earls of Eglinton. This act inevitably caused resentment and resulted in a bloody feud that ran on for centuries. At one point Kerelaw Castle was burned and the Earl of Glencairn retaliated by burning Eglinton Castle although the Earl of Eglinton had escaped to Ardrossan Castle, an impressive fortress until comparatively recent times when Oliver Cromwell had much of its stonework removed and shipped to Ayr to build his new fort. Edward Cunninghame of Auchenharvie was slain in 1526 and Archibald Cunninghame of Waterstoun in 1528. The murder The 1764 coat of arms of the Montgomeries, Earls of Eglinton. On 18 April 1586, Hugh, 4th. Earl of Eglinton, aged twenty- four, was travelling to Stirling to join the court having been commanded to attend by the King, accompanied only by a few domestic servants. He stopped at Lainshaw Castle to dine with his close relative, Neil Montgomerie, who was Lord of Lainshaw and whose Lady was an Elizabeth Cunninghame of Aiket Castle, with sisters married to John Cunninghame of Corsehill and David Cunninghame of Robertland.Dobie It seems that a plot to kill the Earl as an act of revenge had been organised and the Lady, or some say a servant girl who was also a Cunninghame,Robertson, William (1889). \\"Historical Tales of Ayrshire\\". Pub. Glasgow & London. climbed to the battlements after the meal to hang out a white table napkin and thereby spring the plot. Thirty Cunninghames attacked the Earl at the Bridgend Ford and cut his servants to pieces with swords and other weapons, the Earl himself being finally dispatched with a single shot from the pistol of John Cunninghame of Clonbeith Castle. His horse carried his dead body along the side of the river, still known as the 'Weeping', 'Mourning' or 'Widows' path. Kerr,Kerr, T. Macfie (1936). The Bonnet Toun. with local knowledge, states that the site of the crime was recently (1936) built over by a factory, so the site of the ford in question could not have been at the entrance to the Lainshaw Estate at David Dale Avenue, but at the Bridgend Ford instead. Upon the death of the 5th Earl the title passed to a cousin, Sir Alexander Seton. The main representation of the Montgomerie line therefore passed to the Lainshaw line and then to the Cockilbie branch.Montgomery, pages 18 - 19 Aftermath The murdered Earl was eventually taken to Lainshaw Castle, but in the meantime a wave of bloody revenge swept over the district of Cunninghame and elsewhere. Cunninghame friends, relatives and adherents were killed with little or no restraint. The front entrance of Clonbeith Castle with the date 1617 carved above. The Earl of Glencairn showed his lack of involvement by taking no action against the Montgomeries and by leaving his kinsmen to the full weight of the law. Aiket was killed near his home; Robertland and Corsehill escaped to Denmark. Clonbeith was traced to a house in Hamilton, possibly Hamilton PalaceKer, Page 153. and hacked to pieces by Robert Montgomerie and John Pollock of that Ilk. Clonbeith had hid within a chimneyPaterson, V. IV, Page 37 Both Robertland and Corsehill were pardoned on the insistence of Queen Anne of Denmark upon her marriage to King James VI of Scotland, despite his earlier vow to bring them to justice. Robertland was employed as one of her Majesty's master stablers. The properties of the guilty parties had been confiscated and given to the Montgomeries, however the estates were eventually returned in ruinous condition. Lady Elizabeth Montgomerie was said to have fled to Ireland, however it seems that she remained close by, living with an estate tenant, one Robert Barr and family at Pearce Bank (Peacockbank) farm, now High Peacockbank. She was eventually permitted to return to her husband and home, however she never again left the grounds of Lainshaw Castle and she avoided any contact with the Montgomerie family for the remainder of her days. Alexander Cunninghame, the Commendator of Kilwinning Abbey, was shot and killed at his gate at Montgreenan by Sir Robert Montgomerie of Skelmorlie (better known for building the Skelmorlie Aisle as his burial place) on 1 August 1586, as a direct result of the assassination of the Fourth Earl of Eglinton at Stewarton in April of that year.Kilwinning Past & Present, Section 3.19 Lady Elizabeth Montgomerie's ghost is said to haunt Lainshaw Castle, wandering the corridors wearing a green dress and carrying a candle. Other versions of the murder Aiket Castle, home to Lady Montgomerie of Lainshaw. A map of Robertland William Robertson relates a very different tale, stating that Cunninghame of Robertland spent two years developing a friendship with Hugh and despite warnings from Hugo, third Earl, eventually Hugh held Robertland in high esteem and close friendship, giving the opportunity for him to be caught off guard and cut down when attacked by sixty Cunninghame horseman. His servants had all left him to his fate. The site of this action is not recorded. Blair gives this version as well, stating that Cunninghame of Robertland was 'a very dear friend' and loved Earl Hugh 'as his own bedfellow'. Chambers has Cunninghame of Robertland as the leading person in the affair, recording that \\"The Cunninghams, being grieved hereat, made presently a vow that they should be avenged upon the fattest of the Montgomeries for that fact.\\"' The perpetrators all escaped unharmed 'beyond sea', but their lands and castles were awarded to the Earl's brother 'either to be demolished or otherwise'. Robertland himself fled to Denmark and was eventually pardoned by the King and returned to Scotland as her majesty's master stabler. The Earl was on no special journey and the Lady of Lainshaw is not mentioned in this version.Chambers, Pages 100 - 102. George RobertsonRobertson, Page 329. gives yet another, 'traditional' version, in which Cunninghame of Clonbeith is stated as being at best an accessory, although he is still caught and killed in Hamilton. Here the Earl is on his way to a visit to the laird of Robertland Castle, but stops first for a meal at Lainshaw. The Laird of Lainshaw tries to dissuade him from continuing his journey, but to no avail and on his way back from Robertland he is met and murdered by Cunninghame of Aiket at a place called the Windy-path in Stewarton. He was shot and although dying he was able to stay in the saddle until he reached the Annick Ford where he fell from his horse and expired immediately. The Windy-path has been called the Mourning-path since that day. The date of this event is given as 12-05-1589, a date that does not fit with the 1586 date of the first version given. The bridge and weir on the Annick Water below Lainshaw House. StevenSteven states that \\"The ruins, nearly levelled by the hand of time, of the Castle of Robertland formerly stronghold of the Cunninghames, Baronets of Robertland, are situated behind the modern mansion of Alexander Kerr, esq. of Robertland. this stronghold, it is say, was destroyed by fire in a feud between the Montgomeries of Eglinton and the Cunninghames; in revenge for which, one of the Cunninghames shot the chief of the Eglintons, while riding home, near to Bridgend, at the east end of the town of Stewarton, where a path is still shown, called the \\" Weeping Path,\\"along which he rode, until he came to the ford of the Annock, at Bridgend in Stewarton, where he fell dead off his horse. This took place on 12 April 1586. in the person of Hugh, fourth Earl of Eglinton.\\" MacGachen (1844)MacGachen, Pages 116 - 125. gives a confused version in the second collection of prose and verse named the 'Ayrshire Wreath'. The action in this version takes place at the 'Bridge of Annock', erroneously located over the Carmel Burn that is actually located in the Kilmaurs area. The Earl's manservant is wittily named as 'Archie Mucledrouth' and Cunninghame of Aiket is stated to have fired the fatal shot and as having been hunted down and 'cut to pieces' in Hamilton. Many of the Earl's retainers are said to have been killed, the 'stream' running red with their blood, giving a fisherman, a maiden and some children a nasty shock. Otherwise the story is much the same as the RobertsonRobertson (1889), Pages 295 - 305. version. The authors Reilly and Metcalfe have a very different version and state that the earl was on his way from Polnone (Polnoon near Eaglesham) to tryst at Stirling, having travelled about six miles before being attacked and shot by the lairds of Robertland and Aiket, as well as other Cunninghames; no mention is made of the Montgomerie's of Lainshaw.Reilly, Page 20Metcalfe, Page 89 The front entrance of Clonbeith Castle with the date 1617 carved above. Montgreenan Castle or the Bishop's Palace. Fullarton states that the murder was planned by the Earl of Glencairn and that Hugh was most cruelly, shamefully, and unmercifully murdered and slain by John Cunninghame of Reis (brother to the Earl of Glencairn); Alexander Cunninghame (brother of Cunninghame of Polquharne); John Cunninghame (servant to John Cunninghame); David Cunninghame of Robertland; Andrew Arnot of Lochrig; Robert Cunninghame of Kirkland; Alexander Cunninghame of Aiket; William Cunninghame of Aiket; Patrick Cunninghame of Bordland; Abraham Cunninghame (bastard son of Alexander of Clonbeith); John Reyburn of that Ilk; Patrick Cunninghame of Corsehill; John Cunninghame of Clonbeith; Mungo Mure of Rowallan; Alan Foulis in Fulshaw; David Maxwell of Kilmacolm; John Maxwell of Kilmacolm; John Brown in Gateside; David Fulton in Robertland; John Henry in Little Cutstraw; Robert Dick in Crockford; Robert Henry in Robertland; John Hart (servant to David of Robertland); Hugh White (servant to John of Clonbeith); Gilbert Dunlop (servant of Patrick of Baidland); Alexander Speir in Brome; and John Wylie in Roughside.Fullarton, Page 157 McNaught records that a John Cunninghame, son of Patrick Cunninghame of Kirkland was a party to the murder.McNaught, Page 21 See also *Aiket Castle *Clonbeith Castle *Lainshaw Castle *Castle and Barony of Robertland *Skelmorlie Castle References Sources # Adamson, Archibald R.

He played college football at Central Missouri State University. Gile also played indoor football or arena football for the Green Bay Blizzard, Arizona Rattlers, Utah Blaze, Bakersfield Blitz, Odessa Roughnecks and Kansas City Renegades. Based in Scottsdale, Arizona, he is considered one of the nation's top private quarterback coaches and runs his own training academy; while focusing on upper body bio mechanics. Early years Dennis is a native of Arizona where he was a First Team All-Arizona quarterback for Cortez High School in Phoenix, Arizona. College career Gile was a two-year starter for the Central Missouri Mules from 2001 to 2002 and compiled outstanding numbers for the Mules program. During those two seasons, Gile recorded career totals of 4,741 passing yards and 40 touchdowns. He also rushed for 285 yards and three touchdowns. He was a First Team All- Conference quarterback. He broke the national passing efficiency record with a rating of 214.0. He led Central Missouri State to their best combined record in the program‚Äôs history at 20-4. Professional career Dennis Gile broke training camp with the New England Patriots in 2003, and played in the Canadian Football League for the next two seasons. Gile played for the Green Bay Blizzard of the af2 in 2004. Gile was released by the Blizzard on May 6, 2004. He played for the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders from 2004 to 2005. He signed with the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League (AFL) on January 9, 2006. He was signed by the AFL's Utah Blaze on April 5, 2006. Gile was released by the Blaze on April 10, 2006. He played for the Bakersfield Blitz of the af2 in 2007. He played for the Odessa Roughnecks from 2008 to 2009. He threw for 2,027 yards and 41 touchdowns while also recording six rushing touchdowns in 2008. He also led the Roughnecks to a 7-7 regular season record and a playoff victory over the Frisco Thunder. Gile was named to the 2008 IFL All-Star Team. He played for the Kansas City Renegades in 2013. Dennis Gile Quarterback Academy In 2007, Gile established the \\"Dennis Gile Quarterback Academy\\" which is based out of Scottsdale, Arizona. Gile has trained Ryan Kelley, a four-start quarterback recruit, for years in Arizona. Kelley is currently committed to the Arizona State University. The Dennis Gile Quarterback Academy has worked with Kyle Allen, Blake Barnett, and Luke Rubenzer. Gile has also worked with pros such as Colin Kaepernick, Tyrod, Taylor, Tom Brady, Tim Tebow, Brett Hundley, Christian Ponder and Tyrod Taylor. He also helped to get offers for Kyle Allen from Texas A&M; University. In 2015, Gile worked with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for a ten-week offseason session in Arizona. Kaepernick spent five days a week, beginning January 12, working out, watching film and fine-tuning his mechanics. This was the first time in his NFL career where he sought the assistance of independent coaches during the NFL offseason. Every weekday for 10 weeks, he conditioned and lifted weights at the EXOS training facility in Phoenix from 8 to 10:30 a.m. Then, he would spend time in the film room, work on his mechanics and throw passes until 1 p.m. He worked with 49ers wide receivers Quinton Patton and Bruce Ellington, as well as players from other NFL teams, including Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry, Ricardo Lockette and Darrius Heyward-Bey. Top 2015 draft prospects Kevin White, Dorial Green- Beckham and Jaelen Strong also regularly attended the workouts. Gile also worked with former Super Bowl champion, Kurt Warner, while working with Kaepernick. Gile also spent time fine tuning Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor during the NFL offseason.  2016 season  During the 2016 spring break QB training session in Scottsdale, Arizona; Notre Dame quarterback Malik Zaire, who previously trained with Gile, will likely be joined by Deondre Francois (Florida State University), Brandon Harris (LSU) and Manny Wilkins (Arizona State University). When Malik Zaire threw in January 2016, he did it with Kyle Allen (University of Houston), Darrell Garretson (Oregon State University) and Connor Brewer (University of Virginia) while training with receivers Christian Kirk (Texas A&M; University), Speedy Noil (Texas A&M; University) and Emmanuel Butler (Northern Arizona University). For Zaire, the January 2016 winter session ran a week-plus with sessions going about six hours a day. A typical day started with throwing sessions, followed by lifting or speed work. Gile performed quarterback drill mechanics, repeating the throwing motion with Zaire‚Äôs upper body while making sure he got proper drive with his lower body. They also worked on mobility within the pocket, making sure Zaire didn‚Äôt close his stance or lose balance while moving laterally. \\"You want to make it as close as you can to Tom Brady because he‚Äôs the best in the world,\\" Gile said. \\"Good footwork works in every offensive scheme. I just try to make their feet as good as possible.\\" After breaking for lunch, Zaire locked into an Axon Sports virtual reality simulator that is based in one of Gile's facility. No other private quarterback coach has this Axon Sports simulator other than the Dennis Gile Quarterback Academy. \\"We could see everything from the quarterback‚Äôs viewpoint, what the defense is doing, blitzes, coverage adjustments pre-snap, post-snap, all on a 70-inch screen,\\" Gile said. \\"Then we‚Äôd go over film and talk about the game from a graduate level standpoint.\\" Gile believed Zaire was 75-to-80 percent healthy during the winter workouts. For Dennis Gile, who also trained one-time Notre Dame verbal commitment Blake Barnett (Alabama), there‚Äôs already a favorite in the next Irish quarterback competition. \\"Zaire stayed at his father's home during winter break after Notre Dame's Fiesta Bowl loss to Ohio State and worked out with Gile\\". \\"Gile had two sessions with Bush when he talked to The World- Herald. He'd work Bush through some chalkboard/classroom sessions Tuesday night, but Bush told him that he'd done well on playbook quizzes at Nebraska. Bush is throwing alongside a number of starting Division I quarterbacks ‚Äî including Notre Dame's Malik Zaire, Texas A&M;'s Trevor Knight, Houston's Kyle Allen and UCLA's Josh Rosen ‚Äî and doing well. \\"He might have thrown the best post patterns out of anyone,\\" said Gile, who was contacted by Bush's dad to work with the Atlanta native. \\"He figured out a few things. He threw some balls today that would have blown some people's mind. He didn't start out that way, but he was getting it. The biggest thing is how coachable a kid he is.\\" Bush \\"Gile works with the Arizona State University football quarterbacks during their school breaks in Scottsdale Arizona. College trainings are five days long and is very intense as Gile usually has 7 other elite college quarterbacks compete with one another and train with one another. Early in 2016 fall camp Bryce Perkins (ASU) showed off an improved throwing mechanic, which he told SunDevilSource.com was the result of working with local Arizona quarterback coach Dennis Gile during the summer.\\" \\"Bush went to work with private quarterbacks coach Dennis Gile over the summer. The talent level is there ‚Äî his ceiling is super high,\\" said Gile, who played college football and spent two years in the Canadian Football League. \\"I‚Äôm not trying to create somebody who‚Äôs not a quarterback. I‚Äôm just trying to help someone be a better quarterback. No question, he‚Äôs a Division I starting quarterback at a high, high level. It‚Äôs everything. He has all the intangibles to play the position.\\" \\"Zaire stated that he will stay in Arizona to train with Dennis Gile, a quarterback guru of sorts who runs ‚ÄòThe Quarterback Academy‚Äô in Arizona. Zaire will look to sharpen his skills with Gile who has worked with a ton of high- profile talent including stars like Tom Brady and Tyrod Taylor. Gile is known for working his notable collegiate talent as well as he has worked with Zaire in the past, as well as guys like Kyle Allen of Houston and Deandre Francois of Florida State.\\"  2017 season  \\"The 6-foot-4, 225-pound Bush, who has been working out at the Dennis Gile Quarterback Academy in Arizona, originally signed with Nebraska in 2014, spending two seasons on the bench before leaving for the junior college ranks at Iowa Western in Council Bluffs, Iowa, this August. He was battling for the third-team quarterback job at the time.\\" Momentous has executed a talent agreement with Dennis Gile, coach at the Dennis Gile Quarterback Academy, to possibly appear in Momentous' upcoming reality TV series, tentatively titled Chasing a Legend: The Racing Life of Bobby Earnhardt, as well as to star in his own, to-be-determined reality TV series. Gile has worked as a quarterback coach following his playing career. Mr. Gile is a former American football quarterback who played two seasons in the Canadian Football League and was also a member of the New England Patriots, Green Bay Blizzard, Arizona Rattlers, Utah Blaze and Odessa Roughnecks. Additionally, he played at the collegiate level at Central Missouri State University. He also races sprint cars in the USAC Southwest Sprint Cars championships. We will also look at the potential for a sports- related series revolving around Dennis' quarterback school in Scottsdale, Arizona, possibly including major professional football quarterbacks, or a show focusing on his auto racing activities. \\"One similarity with his high school recruiting is knowing that other quarterbacks are also being considered by some of these schools. Former Notre Dame starter Malik Zaire is in a similar predicament as a grad transfer looking for a new home. \\"We‚Äôre really good friends,\\" Harris said. \\"I may end up working out with him in the beginning of April (in Arizona with private quarterbacks coach Dennis Gile).\\" \\"An opportunity. That‚Äôs what Malik Zaire calls the five-month gap between his graduation from Notre Dame last December and an arrival at the next stop in his college career in June ‚Äî wherever that may be. An opportunity to train in Scottsdale, Ariz., with quarterbacks coach Dennis Gile. An opportunity to spend more time with his father, Imani Zaire, who lives in Arizona. An opportunity to recharge, reconsider and redirect his future. \\"It‚Äôs just an opportunity to really rebuild and hammer down on the techniques and just be a quarterback in general,\\" said Zaire, who also worked with Gile ‚Äî a former quarterback at Central Missouri State and in the CFL ‚Äî following Notre Dame‚Äôs Fiesta Bowl loss in January 2016. \\"Playing at the next level is something Hefley is preparing for putting in overtime with his coaches and teammates at Bryant and working when possible with national quarterback guru Dennis Giles in Arizona.\\" \\"Bush has also continued to work with quarterback coach Dennis Gile, who broke training camp with the New England Patriots in 2003, and played in the Canadian Football League for the next two seasons. Bush first trained with Gile while at Nebraska, and has stuck with him since.\\" \\"A former Nebraska quarterback who is a dual-threat option. Fuente also followed Dennis Gile QB Academy, where Bush is currently working out.)\\" \\"Bush, who first worked with Gile after his sophomore year, went back to Arizona to train with the quarterback coach following the season. Texas A&M; showed some interest but didn‚Äôt have a scholarship available until the fall. Then Virginia Tech came calling, with an intriguing opportunity... Gile, who has worked with a long line of quarterbacks, including crossing paths with former Tech QB Tyrod Taylor in the offseason after Taylor signed with the Buffalo Bills, thinks the Hokies are a good fit for Bush... The pursuit led him to make calls to Arizona and private quarterback coach Dennis Gile, who‚Äôd worked with just that kind of player in Bush. \\"Super infectious,\\" Gile said. \\"Just a smiling, happy-go-lucky type kid. Never been down by any situation whenever I‚Äôve been around him. Not one time. Never.\\" \\"He spent last May working out in Arizona with quarterback coach Dennis Gile, training alongside Notre Dame‚Äôs Malik Zaire, Texas A&M;‚Äôs Trevor Knight, Houston‚Äôs Kyle Allen and UCLA‚Äôs Josh Rosen.\\" \\"Instead of going home during spring break, Cal Quarterback Ross Bowers spent the week in Scottsdale, Arizona., training with Dennis Gile at the Quarterback Academy. Each day included a throwing practice, a weightlifting session and a surprise workout ‚Äî something like yoga or boxing.\\" \\"The athletic left-hander told this news organization in March he is spending this semester working out at the Dennis Gile Quarterback Academy in Arizona and wants to finish his career somewhere that could still help him get to the NFL. \\" \\"After moving in with his father in Arizona back in late December, upon completing his classes at Notre Dame, Zaire has been working with professional quarterback coach Dennis Gile to improve his footwork and mechanics.\\" \\"Zaire's father lives in Arizona and quarterback trainer Dennis Gile works out of Scottsdale, Arizona, so that felt like a natural fit for Zaire to train and begin to be recruited anew. He started working with Gile after his departure from Notre Dame to improve and be a team's unquestioned starter.\\" Dennis Gile speaks about his football career to how he became a quarterback coach and more specifically about Deondre Franois (Florida State University) Allen began working with quarterback guru Dennis Gile early in high school, and the two remain close \\"like brothers,\\" often chatting on FaceTime three to four times a week. At their first workout, Gile noticed flaws in Allen's mechanics, but that did not stop him from making a bold prediction. \\"You're going to be the best quarterback in the country,\\" said Gile, who has worked with such star quarterbacks as Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Colin Kaepernick and Cam Newton. \\"His dad and him looked at me like I was crazy.\\" As Allen went to camps and had success he began to get noticed by nearly every major program in the country. \\"Things took off fast,\\" Gile said. \\"\\"It‚Äôs awesome to watch Manny Wilkins battle through what he has experienced in life and transition that to the field. Manny and I train together with our QB coach Dennis Gile. Not many times do you get to watch your former teammates become hometown heroes like Chase and N'Keal.\\" Personal life Gile races sprint cars in the USAC Southwest Sprint Cars championships. In November 2015, Momentous Entertainment Group signed a talent agreement with Gile to appear in two reality TV series made by Momentous. He will appear in a Bobby Earnhardt TV series tentatively titled Chasing a Legend: The Racing Life of Bobby Earnhardt, and star in his own reality series.

It is a tributary of the River Barrow. Name The Finnery River's name is first recorded as Feneure in The Civil Survey A.D. 1654‚Äì56, vol. viii county of Kildare. The spelling Finouse also appears, most likely an error. The 1752 Noble and Keenan map of County Kildare calls it the River Fennery, while Finnery appears first in the 1807 Civil Survey. The Irish language name appears in 1837 as Fionnabhair or Abhainn Fionnabhrach, possibly from the personal name Finnabair. Course The Finnery rises in Hilltown, near Narraghmore. It flows westwards through the Bog of Allen and is bridged by the R418 road halfway between Kilcullen and Athy. It then flows under the R415 road, meets the Tully Stream and passes through Boherbaun, Harristown from which it gets its alternate name. The Finnery continues into Cloney, Kilberry where it bifurcates. The northern branch passes under the R427 road and drains into the Barrow at Derryoughter West, Ballybrackan. The southern branch enters the Barrow near Kilberry. Wildlife The river is characterised by low flow rates, varying depths and a substrate that alternates from mud to sand. An area of riparian woodland, with mature tree species, forms the riparian vegetation along the river. The soil consists principally of poorly- to very poorly-drained organic soils and regosols either as separate entities or in a random inter-layered manner. The organic component has a variable thickness of peat (30 to over 100 cm) formed under relatively base-rich conditions, is occasionally underlain by shell marl (Chara marl matrix permeated with shell residues) 60 cm or more thick with a further layer of calcareous silty clay beneath the marl. The in-stream vegetation includes fool's water cress (Apium nodiflorum), water starwort and duckweed species in areas of low flow. Fringing the river is fool‚Äôs water cress, water dropwort (Oenanthe crocata), water mint, clustered dock (Rumex conglomeratus, soft rush, marsh-bedstraw (Galium palustre), horsetails (Equisetum spp.), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), willows (Salix spp) and silver birch (Betula pendula). Brown trout (Salmo trutta) and salmon (Salmo salar) are the fish species most likely to be found in the Finnery.

Family Ali Shefqeti was the son of Hysen Shefqeti, and Albanian originating from ƒ∞pek who had settled in Uskub. His mother was a local Albanian woman from a rich family. Ali was born in Uskub in September 1883. His brother was Naxhi Shkupi, another Albanian nationalist who invested most of his wealth into the Albanian new state. Education Ali took his elementary education in Salonika, later followed the Monastir Military High School, later the Turkish Military Academy (Kara Harp Okulu), ending with Academy of General Staff in Istanbul, which he finished in 1905. At the end of the Academy he was given the rank captain. Later, he served various positions in the Ottoman Third Army in Macedonia. He supported the Young Turks movement, being part of the military units which attacked Istanbul in 1908. (See: Young Turk Revolution) Albanian Army Disappointed from the Young Turks, and taking advantage of his location in Macedonia where most of the Albanian nationalist movements were situated, he got in touch with Albanian patriotic circles. The end of Albanian Revolt of 1912 would find him in Istanbul with the rank major (binbashi). Ali Shkupi received information that he was on the list to get arrested, therefore escaped to Romania with the support of Albanian community. Later he moved in Trieste (back then part of Austro-Hungary). In March 1913, he participated in the Albanian Congress of Trieste. Ali Shkupi could not reach Vlora because of the blockage from the Greek Navy although his desire was to join the Albanian government. He managed to land near Fier (Seman delta) area from an Austro- Hungarian ship. He was immediately assigned with the organization of the Ministry of War which he succeeded. Ali Shkupi put in place all the experience he had gathered from the extended military education and military service in the Ottoman Army. On May 5, 1913, Vlora Government would approve the \\"Statute for the temporary organization of the Ministry of War\\", and the General Staff Office which he was in command of. The newly created Ministry of War would also have Back Lines Office, Personnel Office, and Medical Office. The statute was detailed and included all necessary structures and mechanisms of a modern army. Military service On 31 May 1913, the General Staff of Shkupi informed the Albanian Ministry of War for the creation of \\"model\\" military units, which would server as basis for the army. The Albanian Army so far consisted mostly of irregulars. Shkupi proposed the mandatory military service. He also built a special commission engaged with military terminology, together with former Ottoman military figures Mustafa Maksuti and Kamber Sejdini (the later an Albanian from Elbasan, who had served as French language teacher in the Monastir Military High School). After the resignation of Ismail Qemali's government on 22 January 1914, Shkupi still held high military positions under Prince Wied. With the break out of World War I, he settled in Shkoder. With the Montenegrin occupation of Shkoder, he got arrested and released only in 1916 when Austro-Hungary invaded Montenegro. He was a supporter of Congress of Lushnje. The government that came out of the congress in January 1920 would assign him first \\"Commander of the General Command\\", and later \\"Chief of the General Staff\\" (after the recreation of the Ministry of War). June Revolution and King Zog Ali Shkupi was a supporter of Hasan Prishtina and the June Revolution of Bishop Noli. With the return of Ahmet Zogu in power in December 1924, he would be arrested and interned twice. He was accused as a main organizer of the Fier Revolt of 1935, and got sentenced to death, but due to protests from inside and outside Albania, he was sentenced to jail and released in 1938. World War II and after Ali Shkupi was not active during World War II, although he was an opponent of the Italian invasion, as well as the German one. The Nazis would burn his house in Tirana. After the war, he resettled in Shkod√´r. He died on 3 December 1953 and was buried in Shkoder. He was reburied in Tirana in the '80s. In 1992, Ali Shefqet Shkupi was decorated for \\"Patriotic Activity of First Class\\" by the Albanian government.

History The Reverend Samuel Ruggles brought the first coffee plant cuttings to Kealakekua-Kona, Hawaii in 1828. The cuttings were taken from plants growing at the home of chief Boki, governor of Oahu, who with help from agriculturalist, John Wilkinson, brought back several young plants acquired in Rio de Janeiro during a royal British voyage taken in 1825. In the late 1800s, the period following the California gold rush, the Kona coffee industry saw its first boom with over three million coffee trees planted throughout West Hawaii. All through the early 1900s the majority of small coffee farms self processed their coffee to the \\"green bean\\" stage and carried them by mule-pulled wagon to small seaports where awaiting ships would carry the coffee to San Francisco for roasting. As of 2020, there are roughly 800 small Kona coffee farms, the bulk of which are 1-8 acres in size. Location The Kona Coffee Belt is a recognized \\"terroir\\" located on Hualalai Mountain and Mauna Loa, ranging from 500 to 3200 feet above sea level.The Kona Coffee BeltIt starts from Hawaii Route 190 on Palani Road, with Makalei being its most northern section, includes Koloko, goes through Hawaii Route 180, also called North Kona Road or Kona Heritage Corridor, passes through Holualoa, and merges with Hawaii Route 11 at Kainaliu and extends through Kealakekua and H≈çnaunau ending in Opihihale at the South Kona Coffee Estate. Characteristics The Kona Coffee belt has a variety of factors that result in a coffee fruit with a distinctive set of characteristics. Some of the main factors include average rainfall (60+ inches per year average), slightly acidic, well-drained volcanic soil, mild temperature swings from day to night (85 degrees day, 60 degrees night average), sunny morning and cloudy afternoons, flowering in the dry season, fruiting during the wet season, and wind-protected western slopes. Main Coffee Plantations and Shops The main coffee plantations and shops are as follows: * Greenwell Farms - Located in Kealakekua Greenwell Farms * Hala Tree Coffee Farm - Located in Captain Cook Hawaii Hala Tree Coffee * Mountain Thunder Coffee Plantation and Tours- Located at elevation of 1000 meters.
