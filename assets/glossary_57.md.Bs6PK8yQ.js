Since 1922 it connects Obstfelderschmiede (Mellenbach-Glasbach) with the village Cursdorf. The train consists of 1.351 km broad gauge cable railway and a connects to 2.635 km standard gauge electrified adhesion railway. History Both railways are operationally closely linked. Since January 1982 the Oberweissbacher-Bergbahn is a historical monument. The railway is operated by Deutsche Bahn AG and offers about thirty rides every half-hour from 5:30 am to 8:00 pm. Operation This funicular is unusual because instead of using two purpose built passenger vehicles, it only features one. The other vehicle is a flatbed truck that is designed to carry a single standard gauge passenger car, freight waggon or locomotive between the conventional railway systems at the bottom and the top. At the top, both vehicles pull into a passenger halt at Lichtenhain/Bergbahn, but the standard gauge rails on the flat bed car can interface with the standard gauge railway. At the bottom, there is a turnout that sends the two vehicles into separate termini. The passenger vehicle is directed into a conventional funicular passenger halt, but the flat bed vehicle is directed to interface with a turntable on the Schwartzatalbahn adjacent to Obstfelderschmiede station. In normal day to day passenger service, the flat bed vehicle is loaded with a dedicated passenger car carrying the Oberwei√übacher Bergbahn branding.

Chandra started playing Chess during a visit to India in 2009 when he was about 9 1/2 years old. Later, when his family relocated to India for a few years, Akshat was further drawn into the game. In January 2010, Chandra received his starting FIDE rating of 1548. In May 2015, within a period of 5 years and 5 months, he crossed the 2500 Grand Master (GM) rating level in realtime rating. This 952 point gain is the fastest rating improvement in the world of this magnitude recorded in such a short time. The gains were achieved prior to FIDE's change of K-factor multiple effective July 2014 for players aged 18 and less, which inflated the point gains by 33% for the same level of performance as before. In the 2016 Saint Louis Autumn Invitational, Chandra achieved the 6-day norm and completed his grandmaster title requirements. He was officially awarded the Grandmaster title in March 2017. In April 2015, at the age of 15, Chandra won the highest Scholastic Chess title in the US‚Äìthe National K-12 Championship. In July 2015, he became the US Junior Champion (Closed). This was the first time in US Chess that both the top Scholastic and the Junior titles were held by the same individual in a single year. In addition, Chandra was the 2015 National High School Blitz Chess Champion as well. In April 2013, as a 13-year old, Chandra won the K-9 Super-National championship. These are the only two US scholastic tournaments Chandra ever played in, winning them both in his first attempt. Chandra has been consistently ranked as the number 1 player in the US in his age category since 2013. He has also been part of the United States Chess Federation (USCF) All America Chess Team for each year, and has qualified to represent the US at the World Youth Championships in all years since 2013. At the age of 14, Chandra won the gold at the North American Youth Championship, U-18 section, in Toronto, Canada. Since April 2014, at the age of 14, Chandra has remained the highest USCF rated Junior Rapid Chess player (U21) in the country. After learning chess from local part-time coaches, Chandra, at the age of 10, began working with his first professional coach, the Serbian GM Predrag Trajkovic, who worked with him for about 4 1/2 years until early 2014. Trajkovic exposed him to the typical Soviet style of chess, with its focus on positional understanding. Chandra is also an avid writer. He has documented his journey from a beginner to Grandmaster level on his blog Quest to GM, which was then converted to his personal website after achieving the GM title. He was also the youngest regular writer for the most visited chess media website in the world, Chessbase, and also contributed articles to the USCF official website. Besides growing up in the US, Chandra has also lived in India for a few years, and for a few months in Europe in 2012. Chandra was a recipient of the 2016 U.S. Chess Trust Scholar-Player award, sponsored by the U.S. Chess Trust and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation. In 2018, Chandra was the winner of the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) FIDE Open tournament. In 2019, Chandra won the 13th annual SPICE Cup Open.

The son of former rally driver Graham Elsmore, he was born in Gloucester and competed in various seasons of the WRC, BRC (British Rally Championship) ANCRO, BTRDA and ERC over his 15 year career. Since his rally debut in 1995 Nik has won a string of accolades. Driving a Vauxhall Nova GSI, by the end of 1997 he had been voted one of the finalists for the ‚ÄúFord/Motoring News Rally Champion of the Future‚Äù as well as being shortlisted to drive for SEAT UK Rally team. Moving to the Nissan Sunny GTI in 1998 and finishing his first event in 2nd place overall, it was the start of a great relationship with the new car. In 1999 he won the prestigious BTRDA Gold Star National Championship, only dropping two points throughout the season. Winning five out of the six rounds and placed second in the other. It was the most convincing Championship win in years. Also during 1999 he won his class in the British Rally Championship and was the leading independent driver, until engine failure on the last round. For 2000, Nik transitioned from a Formula 2 (front wheel drive) to a Mitsubishi Evo 4x4. The season started well with a 7th Overall on the Rally of Wales (British Championship) also receiving at the same time an added bonus of an additional award for ‚ÄúThe Most Promising Young Driver‚Äù. The season ended with another fine outing on the Manx International Rally with a 5th O/A. Using an Evo 5. Niks first overall win was achieved against much tougher world-class opposition on the Wyedean at the start to the 2001 season. Also it saw the start of an opportunity to compete in various European and World Championship events at the wheel of a Guy Colsoul Rallysport car. The season saw Nik competing first in Sweden then Belgium, Germany, Finland, Corsica and finally the Network Q Rally of Gt. Britain. With a 7th Overall on the Wyedean starting off the 2002 season, the team continued with UK rallies only. Another 7th was achieved on the Pirelli Rally and 14th on the Rally of Wales. This fantastic start to the season didn‚Äôt end there, With sponsorship being found with Hydrex Equipment UK, Nik notched up another 3rd Overall on the Woodpecker Stages, plus a 10th on the Bulldog Stages. Finally, at the end of the year, 31st Overall was achieved on the Network Q Rally of Gt. Britain, the final round of the World Rally Championship. The 2003 season highlighted Niks ability to mix it with the leading British drivers, competing in various British rally events and setting many fastest stage times throughout the year. Nik was now labelled as one of the fastest Group N drivers in the country, proving his status by finishing in the Top 20 of the Wales Rally GB, the final round of the World Championship. 2004 Nik entered the Mitsubishi Championship, one of the most competitive one make championships to date. Breaking his arm in the first event of the season slowed progress for the first few rounds, but still finishing the Championship in 3rd position. Nik was the leading driver throughout the first half of the 2005 season. However, a rare engine/electrical fault hampered the championship position, finishing the season in a creditable 4th position. 2006 was a big learning curve for the newly formed, Elsmore Rally Team. Gaining valuable publicity for the sponsors, competing on several selected events throughout the year. The team worked well and Nik achieved solid performances during the season. With the Elsmore Rally Team going into their second year, it was decided to once again fight for the elusive Mitsubishi Evo Challenge title in a new Mitsubishi Evo IX rally car. 2007 would see the best entry yet, with many high profile drivers fighting for the prize of a works drive with Mitsubishi. The season started with a rare brake failure, with Nik still pushing hard, a huge crash on round three would see his title hopes dashed. Relying more on other drivers misfortune, Nik put in a string of consistent results and finished a very commendable 3rd Overall in the championship. The fight continued in 2008 with the ever competitive ANCRO & Evo Challenge Championships, Introducing a new co-driver Craig Drew to the Elsmore Rally Team proved to be the turning point this season. The battle continued to the very last event and a joint 1st Overall in the Mitsubishi Challenge was the reward at the close of season. This was the best result to date for the team & as an added bonus Nik was rewarded with a 4th Overall in the National ANCRO Championship. As the highest placed Group N driver, the team proved competitive against the WRC machinery. Nik continued to use his full International Spec Group N Mitsubishi Lancer Evo IX for the 2009 season. Prepared by chief engineer, Rex Paddock, based in the Forest of Dean. Winning the Wyedean Rally for the second time was a great start, and the pace continued throughout the season with some of the best driving to date. Sadly, mid season, chief engineer & Niks mentor, Rex Paddock was killed in an aeroplane accident. His untimely death was a huge loss to the team, battling through they still managed to finish a rewarding 2nd Overall in the Mitsubishi Challenge and 4th in the ANCRO Championship. With there being such a huge loss to the team during the 2009 season, Nik decided to make the difficult decision to retire from the sport in 2010. With the Wyedean Rally having its 40th anniversary in February 2015, as a former winner, Nik was invited to take part in the event as a one off guest appearance. A class win of over two minutes and an outstanding 5th Overall in an Evo IX, gave Nik the Star of the Rally award, voted for by the national motoring press.

The ‚ÄúHeritage\\"- collection has been dedicated to the Russian cultural and art heritage of the 19th century. By creating the models ‚ÄúDostoevsky‚Äú, ‚ÄúAlexander Pushkin‚Äú, ‚ÄúTolstoi‚Äú and ‚ÄúTchaikovsky‚Äú the Alexander Shorokhoff watch manufacturer pays tribute to these great artists. At the same time, the artistic inspiration of these creations came apparent. Kandy AVGEven though the design could be described as classical, it is likewise more specialized by the unusual colours and forms, the traditional engravings, skeletonizing and enamel coating. The \\"Avantgarde\\"-collection is symbolizing the Russian supremacism; at the same time the design of these watches integrates exceptional elements of shaping and unusual combinations of forms and colours. This is why the view of the watches is provoking and avant-garde like - exactly as their name reveals. The inspiration for the collection comes from the Russian and European art and culture. Models like ‚ÄúMiss Avantgarde‚Äú, ‚ÄúBabylonian‚Äú, ‚ÄúBarbara‚Äú, ‚ÄúKandy‚Äú and the tourbillon ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äú are well characterizing the avant-garde image of the collection. The value of the watches is here also enhanced by fully featured movements with hand engravings or skeletonized dials. \\"The \\"Vintage\\"-collection is very special in many aspects, but it belongs to the ‚ÄúAvantgarde\\"-line, too. The main feature of the \\"Vintage\\"-collection is the exclusive use of ‚ÄúVintage‚Äù-movements of former Russian and Swiss production. These movements are renewed and refined in a long restoring process by exchanging some new manufactured parts for old ones and final engraving. Awards Besides the watch models \\"Miss Avantgarde\\" and \\"Babylonian I\\", which were nominated for the German Design Award in 2014 and 2015,http://www.deutsche-uhrmacher.de/2014/06/german-design- award-2015-babylonian-aus-dem-hause-alexander-shorokhoff-nominiert/ the following models have won the title \\"Special Mention\\" of the German Design Award: \\"Barbara\\" (in 2016)>http://www.deutsche-uhrmacher.de/2015/11/alexander- shorokhoff-veranstaltung-mit-barbara-auf-der-munichtime-2015/ and \\"Winter\\" (in 2017).https://www.watchtime.net/uhren-wissen/5-fakten-ueber-alexander- shorokhoff/ The watch \\"Camomile\\" has been declared the winner of the German Design Award in 2018 http://www.german-design-award.com/die- gewinner/galerie/detail/16389-camomile.html by the German Council of Design. The watch \\"Regulator AS.R02-1\\" won the third place in the category A in the competition for the ‚ÄúGolden balance\\"/‚ÄùGoldene Unruh‚Äù in 2017\\" https://www.burda.com/de/news/goldene-unruh-2017/pdf/ and was chosen by the readers of specialized watch magazines. Production details The watch movements are purchased from well-known Russian and Swiss producers with the basic calibres by Dubois Depraz, Concepto, Soprod and ETA. The movements are refined and hand engraved at the manufactory of ‚ÄúAlexander Shorokhoff‚Äú. The screws are also blued here; the dials and cases are covered by enamel. The production of own manufactory movements is planned; at the moment the manufacturer is already making its special modules for the regulators and chrono-regulators. For every watch one watchmaker bears the responsibility. All watches are delivered with a hand signed certificate including several details about the deviation of running data and the amplitude as well as a certificate of origin.

This period gave Latina women the opportunity to express their own agency and examine their roles as women and Latinas in the context of American society. Through their support of U.S. war efforts both overseas and on the homefront, these women began to question their societal status and call for changes within their culture and country.  Before the war  In the aftermath of World War I, countries of Europe were left in debt from the war, inflation started to rise, and the United States suffered from the Great Depression. The political and social changes around the world proved volatile. The United States opposed the fascist regimes that were gaining ground around the world, but it was not until December 1941 that the U.S. entered into the War after the December 7 attacks on Pearl Harbor incited public support and Congress declared war on Japan on December 8, 1941. This began U.S. involvement in World War II and set the stage for Latina involvement as well. = Latinos in the U.S. = While Latinos, men and women of Latin American descent, had served in World War I and promoted the efforts of the United States overseas and on the home front, Latinos in many areas of the country were still suffering from discrimination. Indeed, although many joined the military or worked in the fields in order to continue production, and a large number of Latinos moved to northern states in order to support the industrial sector of the economy, they were often blamed for the economic problems the country was now facing In fact, Herbert Hoover even went so far as to place blame on undocumented Latinos for the economic pitfalls and high unemployment rates during the Great Depression. In order to combat the criticisms of organized labor, Secretary of Labor William Doaks reinvigorated the Immigration and Naturalization Service and advocated for the use of random raids and the use of repatriation trains to send those found to be undocumented or unable to prove their citizenship back to their home country. This use of fear and political rhetoric to categorize Latinos in the United States as the ‚Äúother‚Äù helped in the creation of stereotypes and contributed to ideas that many Latino Americans were treated as though ‚Äúthey were invisible men and women -- part of the landscape, supporting actors in a drama that purported only to affect them, not to be affected by them. This thought, that Latino Americans simply sat on the sidelines and were not involved in the war efforts and mainstream society during and after World War I was not based on fact, but rather societal stereotypes. Many Latinos found themselves continuing to experience racial discrimination and unfair treatment in much of the United States, with fear and inequality being common threads uniting many of the Latino experiences in the United States during this time period. Latina women faced this discrimination because of their racial and ethnic backgrounds, but were also treated unfairly because of their gender. Gender roles were clearly outlined in the U.S. at this time, and were particularly strong in Latino culture as well. While the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote, was passed in 1919, gaining equality in society was another issue. Despite this discrimination, many Latina women answered the country‚Äôs call for support during World War II, both overseas and on the home front.  Latinas at war  = Life overseas = A poster for the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, 1941.Photo Courtesy of Wikipedia Commons. During World War II the Women's Army Corps and the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps were created alongside the existing Army Nurse Corps. This gave women the chance to work not only as nurses, but as uniformed members of the armed forces. Due to their fluency in the Spanish language, Latina women were even sought out for positions as ‚Äúcryptologists and in correspondence and communications.\\" Life overseas was difficult for many members of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps because they were not protected by the same international laws as prisoners of war. Furthermore, they were not granted the same benefits as their male counterparts and often faced gender discrimination and well as racial discrimination while overseas and within their respective units. The opportunity to go overseas did, however, open possibilities for Latina women who had not been trained in a trade before, and for many this was their first job outside the home and domestic duties, which provided invaluable experience for many Latinas seeking to expand their knowledge into more technical fields and contribute to the war effort. The opportunity to aid in the efforts overseas also allowed many Latinas to travel and see parts of the world that they never would have been given the opportunity to see had it not been for their involvement in the war. Women worked in positions such as nurses, technical agents, mechanics, and telegram operators overseas. In these positions, women gained new skills and a sense of \\"personal freedom\\" achieved by leaving their towns and communities. This increased their individual agency and set them up for success upon returning home. = Returning home = Carmen Contreras-Bozak, a member of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, during World War II.Photo Courtesy of Wikipedia Commons While women were a vital part of the military's success, they did not always receive recognition. This disparity is even greater when looking at the recognition of Latina Women in the armed forces and their work as nurses overseas. As Latina women returned to the United States, many expected to be welcomed as heroes who had served their country valiantly, however this was not the case. They were discriminated against because of their gender and their military status did not change the perception of Latinas in the eyes of much of the American public at the time. To many, they were still seen as second class citizens, foreigners, and others. In their local communities, many of these women who had served in the armed forces or as nurses during the war returned to their hometowns and respective communities. Many Latinas hoped their service to military efforts would be a springboard for which to jumpstart their educational or career goals, and it was. Women entered the workforce in greater numbers after World War II and were able to bypass many of the cultural norms surrounding women's roles in and outside of the home through military service. While Latina women made powerful connections in their time overseas and assisting various branches of the military, there were also some issues with re-acclimation. Returning home was sometimes difficult due to the failure of the government to give them the same social benefits as their male counterparts. While males experienced the same discrimination based on race back in the United States, they were also given benefits from things like the GI Bill which granted them the ability to go to college and buy homes. The contributions of Latinas throughout the war were notable and courageous, but have been overlooked by many. Another point of conflict existed between the women who served overseas and women who stayed on the home front. There was often underlying tension and judgement of women who had enlisted to serve in the WAAC as \\"drinkers and smokers\\" or morally dubious women by those who remained in the United States. While the women who served overseas did much to contribute to the war effort, those who remained on the homefront also contributed to the country's fight.  Latinas on the home front  = Agriculture = One of the biggest sources of agricultural jobs for Mexicans in the United States during World War II was the Bracero Program. Briefly, it was a temporary work agreement between the United States and Mexico through which Mexican workers would be sent to the United States for a certain amount of time, and would then return to Mexico. Women were not enlisted into the Bracero Program, however it still had a profound effect on Latinas. When Mexican men entered into the Bracero Program, they often left behind their wives alone to raise their family back in Mexico. With only one caretaker in Mexico, and because it took a long time for funds from the Bracero Program to actually be sent back to Mexico, many women were forced into undocumented migration into the United States. Many women never made it across the border, further separating families and deepening issues between the United States and Mexico. In addition to women being forced to attempt crossing the border to support their families, there were also women who, now that their husband had left to go to the United States, they were left with the family business back in Mexico. It was never acknowledged, but due to the Bracero Program, women in Mexico were now transitioning into more decision-making roles and participating more heavily in their family businesses. = Industry = Mexican American women working at Friedrich Refrigeration As exemplified by the iconic image of Rosie the Riveter, during World War II due to the increasing lack of men on the home front, women started to migrate into more factory and industry-based jobs. In addition, not only were men leaving their factory jobs to enlist in the Army, the need for factory workers was increasing as the need for defense production increased. As this need increased, \\"Factory managers considered 'the degree to which womanpower might take the place of manpower ... on the factory floor.'\\" What is not identified by Rosie the Riveter is that many of the women taking up these positions were, in fact, Latinas. Latina women started to fill the positions left behind by men, and as the war progressed these factories started to produce parts for weapons, ships, or aircraft as opposed to whatever products they produced pre- war. The Friedrich Refrigeration Company in San Antonio, Texas, was on contract to make parts for bombs, and much of the company's workforce consisted of Mexican-American women. As well as working in these sorts of factory jobs, Latinas became a big part of the workforce in sweatshops, especially right after World War II. Latinas could be very low-wage workers, and U.S. industries, such as the garment industry took advantage of that. The garment industry would continue to relocate to lower-wage areas, and Latina women in need of work would migrate to where the jobs were. = Societal effects = The transition from domestic life into working life, or from less intensive jobs into higher intensity positions, for Latinas during World War II had major societal effects. Women working in industrial jobs led to a relaxation of gender roles. Their new roles in the workforce required new attire, such as coveralls, overalls, pants, and big heavy shoes, none of which would have been seen as women's attire prior to this shift of women into industry.Rivas-Rodriguez, Maggie, and B. V. Olgu√≠n. Latina/os and World War II: Mobility, Agency, and Ideology. Austin: U of Texas, 2014. Print. In addition to new clothing, the shift in work meant women were acquiring new skills, aiding in the changing societal gender norms. The image of Rosie the Riveter was also an interesting one considering World War II's societal effects on Latinas. She was portrayed as a white woman, but represented many more than just white women in that time. In fact, the majority of women who embodied the \\"denim-clad, tool-wielding, can-do figure\\" were not white women, but rather women of color. In addition to the societal change from women in the home to working women, Latina women also took part in the Pachuca and Zoot Suit culture of World War II. The women's participation in this, as feminizing the zoot suit to fit their needs, showcased the newfound mobility and agency gained from the War. The female zoot suiters were bold, knowing that they were challenging gender norms. They were excluded from history for their failure to fit the masculine profile, however the women pachucas can be seen as a symbol of independence.  Aftermath  As servicemen returned home from World War II, employment opportunities for women and especially women of color decreased. Post-war reconversion efforts lead to first the firing of Latina and African American women followed by intense social pressures for all women to leave the workforce and return to domestic lives. With the economy shifting from wartime to peace, many war-related industries reduced production and employment. Attitudes towards the layoffs were mixed; Some Latinas were happy to return home to their children, others chose to turn to desk jobs that were considered more \\"womanly\\" and less labor-intensive, lastly a few wanted to stay in their previous jobs. Some Latina women felt a strong sense of patriotism while working in war-related industries. Options to fight discrimination practices diminished as Truman disbanded the Office of War Information and Office of the Coordinator of the Inter-American Affairs.Escobedo, Elizabeth Rachel. \\"Civil Rights and Postwar Life.\\" From Coveralls to Zoot Suits: The Lives of Mexican American Women on the World War II Home Front.

It was the final UFC event under the ownership of Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, which began in January 2001. Zuffa subsequently announced its sale to a group led by WME-IMG, an American talent agency with offices in Beverly Hills, which included Silver Lake Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and MSD Partners. Background The event was the first that the organization has hosted at T-Mobile Arena, which opened in April 2016. It took place during the UFC's annual International Fight Week and marked the second time the UFC hosted three events in consecutive days. =Main event changes: McGregor is pulled; Jones tests positive; Tate-Nunes headline= A welterweight rematch between The Ultimate Fighter 5 winner and former lightweight title challenger Nate Diaz and the then current UFC Featherweight Champion Conor McGregor was originally expected to headline the event. The pairing previously met earlier in the year at UFC 196. McGregor was expected to challenge UFC Lightweight Champion Rafael dos Anjos, but dos Anjos pulled out due to a broken foot only 11 days before the event. Diaz eventually replaced him and the bout was shifted to the welterweight division. Diaz won the fight via rear-naked choke in the second round. On April 19, after McGregor tweeted a supposed retirement, the UFC announced that he was pulled from the event and a replacement for him was being sought. UFC President Dana White clarified that McGregor's removal was related to his refusal to come to a press conference that week, because \\"he was in Iceland training and didn't want to ruin his preparation for the fight\\". McGregor released a statement two days later, claiming he was not retired and that he requested the UFC to allow him to focus more on the fight preparation this time, as he felt he lost his focus during the media obligations for the previous fight. He then stated that he was ready for the event and would come for a scheduled New York press conference, but if that's not enough, he \\"doesn't know what to say\\". A report later claimed that the UFC decided to cancel the fight indeed, in what was rumored to be a $10 million paycheck for McGregor. T-Mobile Arena hosted the much anticipated event, which was the 363rd overall in UFC history On April 27, the UFC officially announced the new headliner as a UFC Light Heavyweight Championship unification rematch between current champion Daniel Cormier and former champion Jon Jones, who is also the current interim champion. The pairing met previously at UFC 182 in January 2015 with Jones defending his title via unanimous decision. Subsequent to that victory, Jones was stripped of the title and suspended indefinitely from the UFC in connection with a hit- and-run incident that he was involved in. Cormier replaced him and went on to defeat Anthony Johnson at UFC 187 to win the vacant title. Their rematch was originally expected to take place at UFC 197, but Cormier pulled out three weeks before the event due to injury and was replaced by Ovince Saint Preux, in what became an interim title bout. Jones went on to defeat Saint Preux by unanimous decision and won the interim title. The event suffered another major hit only three days before it happened, as it was announced that Jones was pulled out by USADA due to a potential Anti-Doping Policy violation stemming from an out-of-competition sample collection on June 16. Cormier declared he would still fight if an opponent brought to him \\"made sense\\". Additional information on Jones' situation will be provided as the process moves forward. A day later Jones apologized for the incident, but denied knowingly taking any illegal substance. He and his manager also declined to specify the substance that resulted in the failed test. His \\"B\\" sample also came positive for the same substances and Jones' faces a potential two-year suspension. During the UFC Fight Night: dos Anjos vs. Alvarez broadcast, it was announced that former UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva would replace Jones on less than two days' notice and face Cormier in a three-round non-title light heavyweight bout. Due to those major changes, the already scheduled UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship bout between then champion Miesha Tate and top contender Amanda Nunes was revealed as the new main event. =Main card: a former champion returns; an interim champion is crowned= UFC Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar had a leave of absence from the WWE to compete at this event, his first fight since UFC 141 in December 2011 On June 4, a few hours before the UFC 199 event, MMAFighting.com reporter Ariel Helwani broke the news that former UFC Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar was close to finalizing a deal to return at this event, despite being active in the WWE. The UFC confirmed the report, via a teaser video clip on the UFC 199 main card broadcast. However, Helwani's news scoop earned him a prompt physical ejection from the event venue and a lifetime ban from covering future UFC live events. The organization faced a major backlash from the media community as well as fans, before reinstating Helwani's media credentials. They also stated that it was their belief \\"recurring tactics used\\" by Helwani \\"extended beyond the purpose of journalism\\", a statement that MMAFighting.com disagreed with. Lesnar faced the 2001 K-1 World Grand Prix winner and former interim title contender Mark Hunt. Due to Jones' removal from the card, this bout was briefly promoted as the new main event. However, after the Tate-Nunes bout was announced as the new headliner, Lesnar-Hunt was once again confirmed as the co-main event. Lesnar also headlined UFC 100 and with Jones' absence, he and Jim Miller remained as the only two fighters to compete at both milestone events. Due to McGregor's experiments outside of his division, an interim UFC Featherweight Championship bout between former champion Jos√© Aldo and former lightweight champion Frankie Edgar took place at this event. It was a rematch, as Aldo previously defended his title against Edgar at UFC 156 in 2013 via unanimous decision. The main card opened with a heavyweight bout between former two-time champion Cain Velasquez and Travis Browne. =Stacked under- card= The featured bout of the preliminary card was a women's bantamweight contest between former title challenger Cat Zingano and The Ultimate Fighter: Team Rousey vs. Team Tate winner Julianna Pe√±a. A few other bouts were also part of the Fox Sports 1 televised prelims: *a welterweight bout between former UFC Welterweight Champion Johny Hendricks and The Ultimate Fighter: Team Jones vs. Team Sonnen winner Kelvin Gastelum. *a bantamweight rematch between former UFC Bantamweight Champion T.J. Dillashaw and Raphael Assun√ß√£o. The pairing first met at UFC Fight Night: Maia vs. Shields in October 2013, when Assun√ß√£o won a close bout via split decision. *Opening that portion of the event in the lightweight division was a bout between Sage Northcutt and Enrique Mar√≠n. A lightweight bout between Joe Lauzon and The Ultimate Fighter 1 winner and former lightweight title challenger Diego Sanchez was originally booked for UFC 180. However, the bout was cancelled due to both fighters being injured. The fight was later rescheduled for this event and headlined the UFC Fight Pass preliminary card. A middleweight bout between former Strikeforce Light Heavyweight Champion Gegard Mousasi and Derek Brunson was expected to take place at the event, but on June 19 it was announced that Brunson pulled out due to injury and was replaced by Thiago Santos. Former PRIDE Lightweight Champion Takanori Gomi and Jim Miller were chosen to open the event in a lightweight bout. =Weigh-ins= At the weigh-ins, Hendricks missed weight by a quarter of a pound, weighing in at 171.25 lb. He was not given a second attempt to make the weight because the recently introduced early weigh-in procedures set a 10:00 a.m. cut-off time and Hendricks weighed in at the last possible moment. As a result, he was fined 20% of his fight purse, which went to Gastelum.

Takanori Gomi: $55,000 ^ Johny Hendricks was fined 20 percent of his purse ($20,000) for failing to make the required weight for his fight with Kelvin Gastelum. That money was issued to Gastelum, an NSAC official confirmed. Records set The event had a $10,700,000 gate, which broke the record for a mixed martial arts event in the United States. The final attendance was 18,202, a record for Nevada, which had hosted 104 prior UFC events. The total disclosed payout for the event reached nearly $7 million at $6,979,000, believed to be the highest combined disclosed payday in UFC history. Lesnar's fight purse was also the highest, breaking Conor McGregor's record from UFC 196 by $1.5 million. Aftermath On July 15, it was announced that USADA informed Lesnar of a potential Anti-Doping Policy violation stemming from an out-of-competition sample collection on June 28 from the WADA-accredited UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory on the evening of July 14. Four days later, USADA announced another failed test: this time in-competition. It was the same substance, which was not disclosed. On July 23, reports came that Lesnar tested positive for hydroxy-clomiphene, which was revealed days earlier as one of the substances responsible for Jones' test failure. Lesnar was eventually suspended by the NSAC on December 15 for a period of one year, retroactive to the date of the event and his win was overturned to a no contest. He was also fined 10% of his purse. In early January 2017, USADA also suspended Lesnar for the same period, but this time retroactive to the moment he was provisionally suspended. On July 18, the NSAC confirmed the substances for which Jones tested positive: hydroxy-clomiphene, an anti-estrogenic agent and letrozole metabolite, an aromatase inhibitor. A temporary suspension placed on Jones' Nevada fight license was subsequently extended by a unanimous vote, while a formal hearing was expected for September or October. On November 7, USADA announced that Jones was suspended for a period of one year retroactive to the July 6 date on which he was provisionally suspended. Two days later, the UFC announced that Jones was stripped of the interim title. The NSAC also suspended Jones for the same period as USADA.

Feuerstein received media attention in 2015 for posting videos on social media wherein he discussed then-recent events such as same-sex marriage legislation in the United States and Starbucks' red holiday cups.  Personal life  Feuerstein was born on January 7, 1981 in Stanislaus County, California. He married Jessica Reynolds in 2014, and the couple have six children. Feuerstein and his family reside in Fountain Hills, Arizona. Controversial videos = Bakery video = Feuerstein first received media attention in April 2015 after he posted a video where he denounced Cut the Cake, a bakery in Longwood, Florida. In the video, Feuerstein stated that he had called the bakery on April 1, 2015 and asked them to make a cake with an anti-gay marriage message on it. After the owner refused Feuerstein posted the video and encouraged his followers to call the bakery themselves and show what he said was hypocrisy. This resulted in his followers attacking the bakery's Facebook page, including posting one-star reviews. Feuerstein later removed the video and stated that he had done this as part of a social experiment on religious freedom. Cut the Cake commented on his video, stating that his video had hurt their business and that they had received death threats over his actions. The bakery held an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, through which they raised over $13,000. = Second Amendment video = He received more media attention in July 2015 after uploading a video that some media outlets such as Salon and Logo TV implied that Feuerstein was encouraging followers to use violent actions against backers of anti-discrimination measures and legalized same-sex marriage. In the video Feuerstein cited several media cases to back up claims were attacks on Christianity, such as claims that owners of the Hitching Post Wedding Chapel were going to face jail time and fines if they did not perform same-sex marriages. Towards the end of the video Feuerstein stated ‚ÄúThey are coming after our First Amendment constitutional rights. Well, check this out. This is one pastor that will not bow. Why? Because my First Amendment right is guaranteed by my Second Amendment right.‚Äù The Advocate heavily criticized Feuerstein, calling the video \\"disturbing\\". Writers for The Advocate and HuffPost also asserted that several of his claims were inaccurate. = Planned Parenthood video = On July 29, 2015, Feuerstein also uploaded a video onto the video-sharing website Vimeo, in which he is shown saying, \\"I say, tonight, we punish Planned Parenthood. I think it‚Äôs time that abortion doctors should have to run and hide and be afraid for their life.‚Äù [sic] The original video was taken down on November 30, 2015, in the aftermath of the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting but it was saved and reposted onto YouTube by several others. = Starbucks video = In November 2015 Feuerstein posted a video on Facebook criticizing Starbucks for removing Christmas-related symbols from its holiday cups in favor of a solid red design.

Location Killeshin Church is located near Killeshin village, on the south bank of the Fushoge River (a tributary of the Barrow), about 5 km (3 mi) west of Carlow town. A ringfort, known as Killeshin moat, stands to the southeast. History A monastery was founded on the site c. AD 545 by Diarmait mac Siabairr, a member of the local U√≠ Bairrche ruling family. The monastery was plundered by Diarmait mac M√°el na mB√≥ in 1041; the dairthech (oak prayer house) was demolished, a hundred people taken away as slaves and 700 cattle also seized. This attack was a retaliation against the burning of Ferns by Murchadh mac Dunlaing and the murder of Domnall Remar (Donal the Fat, Diarmait's brother). Killeshin was burned again in 1077, along with its yew trees. None of this original monastery survives; a round tower once stood there but was torn down by the landowner in 1704. The buildings The church, built in the 12th century AD (probably in 1150‚Äì60), is built of rubble masonry with dressed quoins and is particularly noted for its Romanesque archway, zoomorphic carvings and Scandinavian-influenced knotwork. There is also a granite font. An inscription near the door reads ORAIT DO DIARMAIT RI LAGEN, Middle Irish for \\"a prayer for Diarmait, king of Leinster\\", referring to Diarmait Mac Murchada (r. 1126‚Äì71).

Plot  Anna Dobrokhotova was born and raised in a village. Life in the village is constant, hard and exhausting work, but unlike other hard-working villagers, Anna is lazy and disorganized. Sunbathing, lying on a feather bed, and eating something delicious ‚Äì this is the farthest her girlish aspirations transpire. A random affair with a young student leads into Anna's pregnancy and birth of a child, but these relations do not develop further because Anna does not wish to get married presently. Anna moves to a city and goes to work at a confectionery factory. Anna's income improves, but this does not change her views on life ‚Äì she is still lazy, indifferent to the surrounding world and people, and does not strive to further expand her horizons. Anna becomes a classical example of the petty bourgeois; a self-centered woman whose whole existence is reduced to the purpose of accumulating material wealth and the creation of personal comfort. During a visit to her female friend, Anna meets Nikolai Egorovich Kushakov, a lonely disabled war veteran. Their love affair turns into a full-fledged marriage, and at first it seems to Anna that her personal life is finally put in order. Private flat, furniture, fridge ‚Äì all these symbols of an \\"affluent\\" life are obtained by Nikolai Egorovich which pleases Anna very much. But the seemingly happy marriage falls apart; Kushakov leaves the family, because living together with a narcissistic philistine becomes unbearable for him. Her son, Yuri, fully supports his stepfather in the conflict and also leaves the house and goes to the Nakhimov Naval School. Soon in the village her old mother dies, and Anna is left completely alone. While walking in the forest, Anna meets Tikhon Sokolov, a simple construction worker who operates a crane. He's divorced, and at first Tikhon is under the impression that Anna is the new great love in his life. Anna, itching to find a husband, seizes Tikhon into a \\"stranglehold\\" and behaves in an extremely indecent and tiresome way. Relationship between Tikhon and Anna seems to be developing, but... As Tikhon gets closer acquainted with Anna, he understands that this simple-minded and selfish woman does not arouse anything in him except for feelings of disgust, and so without hesitating, he throws out Anna from his home and out of his life. And so again, the \\"sweet woman\\" Anna, beautiful and wealthy, is in the state of tragic loneliness that she herself has been creating all these years. –°–ª–∞–¥–∫–∞—è –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω–∞ Cast * Natalya Gundareva as Anna Aleksandrovna Dobrokhotova * Svetlana Karpinskaya as Lidiya Nikolaevna Dyadkina, Anna's friend * Pyotr Velyaminov as Nikolai Egorovich Kushakov, Anna's husband * Oleg Yankovsky as Tikhon Dmitrievich Sokolov, Anna's boyfriend * Rimma Markova as Anna's mother * Georgy Korolchuk as Larik Shubkin, Anna's first boyfriend, the father of her son * Nina Alisova as Raisa Ivanovna Shubkina, Larik's mother * Fyodor Nikitin as Shubkin, Larik's father Filming *The producer Vladimir Fetin confirmed his wife Lyudmila Chursina for the role of the main heroine; he devised the film with her in mind.

Early life and education Girma was born in Oakland, California in 1988 to father Girma Kidane Adgoy and mother Saba Gebreyesus. Her mother fled Eritrea in 1983 during the Eritrean War of Independence and met her father, an Eritrean, in California. Girma lost her vision and hearing as a result of an unknown progressive condition beginning in early childhood. She retains 1% of her sight. Growing up in the United States, Girma benefited from civil rights laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act. She also had accessible technology, such as a digital Braille device‚Äîsomething her elder brother Mussie Gebre, who is also deafblind, did not have access to in Eritrea. She graduated from Skyline High School, a mainstream public school, in 2006. At the age of 15, Girma traveled to Mali to do volunteer work, building schools with buildOn. Girma attended Lewis & Clark College, where she successfully advocated for her legal rights to accommodations in the school cafeteria. She graduated from Lewis & Clark magna cum laude in 2010. She then became the first deafblind student to attend and graduate from Harvard Law School, earning her J.D. in 2013. Career In 2013, Girma joined Disability Rights Advocates (DRA) in Berkeley, California as a Skadden Fellow. She worked there from 2015 to 2016 as a staff attorney, working on behalf of people with disabilities. Girma says she became a lawyer in part to help increase access to books and other digital information for persons with disabilities. She now works to change attitudes about disability around the world, including the development of accessible digital services: \\"Digital information is just ones and zeroes...It can be converted into any kind of format. And those people who develop these services‚Äîprogrammers, technology designers‚Äîthey have an incredible power to increase access for people with disabilities. And I hope they use it.\\" While working for DRA in July 2014, Haben represented the National Federation of the Blind and a blind Vermont resident in a lawsuit against Scribd for allegedly failing to provide access to blind readers, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Scribd moved to dismiss, arguing that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) only applied to physical locations. In March 2015, the U.S. District Court of Vermont ruled that the ADA covered online businesses as well. A settlement agreement was reached, with Scribd agreeing to provide content accessible to blind readers by the end of 2017. In 2014, Girma gave a talk at TEDxBaltimore. She confronted TED for not readily providing captions for all of their recorded TEDx talks, including her own. In January 2015, Girma was appointed to the national board of trustees for the Helen Keller Services for the Blind. On July 20, 2015, Girma met with US President Barack Obama at the White House to highlight the importance of accessible technology. She provided introductory remarks on the occasion, the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In April 2016, Girma left DRA to take up non-litigation advocacy full-time. In June 2016, Girma gave a talk on accessible design at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. In 2018, the Washington Post published an op-ed by Girma directed at the Texas State Board of Education, which had voted to remove Helen Keller from the social studies curriculum. The board ultimately reversed its decision. In August 2019, she released a memoir, Haben: The Deafblind Woman Who Conquered Harvard Law. Personal life Girma enjoys participating in physical activities including surfing, rock climbing, kayaking, cycling, and dancing. Girma uses the assistance of a guide dog.

History  The Tongcheng school of literary prose was founded by Fang Bao, Liu Dakui, and Yao Nai who were natives of Tongcheng Country, Anhui Province in the early years of the Qing dynasty. Fang Bao initiated the genre using what he had learned from his teacher Gui Youguang, creating the concept of Yi Fa. Yi refers to the central ideas or arguments within an article and Fa to the various literary forms and artistry that are present in the theory of the Tongcheng school. The style of writing was more stoic in nature in that it stressed the need to present the purpose of the article in a concise manner without excessive pomp or romance in the writing style. The school rose to prominence under the Kangxi Emperor and prospered throughout the Qing period. Significant originating writings of the school include Fang Bao's Random Notes from Prison and Yao Nai's Ascent to Mount Tai.  Writers  Significant authors of the Tongcheng style include Fang Bao's students: Shen Tong, Wang Youpu, Shen Tingfang, Wang Zhaofu, Chen Dashou and Li Xueyu; Liu Dakui's students: Wang Zhuo, Wu Ding and Cheng Jinfang; and Yao Nai's students: Guan Tong, Men Cengliang, Fang Dongshu and Yao Ying.

An influential labor economist, Rees taught at Princeton University from 1966 to 1979, while also being an advisor to President Gerald Ford. He was also a former Provost of Princeton and former president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. He was also the first head of the Council on Wage and Price Stability, a short-lived federal agency.  Discussion  Born in New York City, Rees earned his bachelor's degree from Oberlin College in 1943. He later received his master's degree and his doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago. After obtaining his Ph.D. in 1950, he would go on to chair the economics department at Chicago from 1962-1966 before moving to Princeton as economics chair there. He would later co-author a landmark labor study with George P. Shultz. Another notable book, The Economics of Work and Pay, remained in print for two decades over at least six editions at Harper Collins. Notable doctoral students at Princeton would include the future Nobel Laureate James Heckman. He won many awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1969 and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. Rees died on September 5, 1992, at University Medical Center of Princeton. Since 1997, Princeton University awards the \\"Albert Rees Prize\\" for an outstanding dissertation in labor economics. Oberlin College has also established multiple Albert Rees prizes, including a Fellowship and an Assistantship. Duke University Libraries has a special collection with his papers. Additional special collections at George Mason University Libraries and the Ford Presidential Library house archives for the Council on Wage and Price Stability, of which he was the founding director.  Council on Wage and Price Stability  The Council on Wage and Price Stability (COWPS or CWPS) Act was signed into law by President Ford in 1974, with Rees as the new agency's first head. It replaced the formal price controls from the Nixon administration authorized under its precursor, the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 and its related agency, the Pay Board and Price Commission. The council continued under President Carter (with Alfred E. Kahn replacing Rees as its head under the new administration). When Reagan took office in 1981, CWPS economists moved to the newly formed Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Some labor and economic regulator responsibilities merged back into their historic homes with the National Labor Relations Board and the Council of Economic Advisors.

Adult life In April 1862, Job advertised that he had purchased the Willaston Stores from Mrs Gilbert and in 1864 he operated the first Post Office at Willaston from his store. Job Harris married Mary Hattam (1843‚Äì1923) at St Peter's Church, Williamstown, South Australia on 2 September 1862. Mary's father, Samuel Hattam, a Cornishman, was a blacksmith at Williamstown. Job and Mary Harris had 7 children: Elizabeth (1864‚Äì1869), Louisa Jane (Harris) Parmenter (1865‚Äì1957), Alfred James (1867‚Äì1957), Herbert George (1870‚Äì1952), Elizabeth Saunders (Harris) Stevens (1872‚Äì1945), William Lewis (1875‚Äì1966) and Mary (Harris) Vivian (1880‚Äì1962). 1867 saw Job Harris apply to the Adelaide Licensing Bench for a licence to operate the Sandy Creek Hotel, Sandy Creek. Job and Mary Harris continued to run the Sandy Creek Hotel, their first daughter Elizabeth dying there on 14 July 1869 of typhoid fever. The stables at the hotel burnt down on Sunday, 12 September 1869, thought to be due to a broken lantern and in 1870, Job had a saddle and bridle, as well as a mare left in his charge stolen by a boy who worked for him. New Year's Day of 1878 saw sports being held in Job Harris's paddock at Sandy Creek and the day was enjoyed by all. Job Harris died on 12 January 1882 at Sandy Creek, of ulcers of the stomach. The Gawler newspaper of Friday, 13 January 1882 reported \\"Death of Mr. Job Harris. ‚Äì Last night Mr. Job Harris, of the Sandy Creek Hotel somewhat unexpectedly passed away. Deceased had been about 14 years at the hotel, and formerly resided at Willaston. He was well known, and much respected.\\" The funeral left the Sandy Creek Hotel on Saturday, 14 January 1882 for the Willaston General Cemetery. Siblings Sadly, in 1868, Job's younger surviving sister Hannah, died at Bertha, Willaston. She is buried in the Willaston Cemetery in the Davies/Harris family plot. Job's older sister, Ann Harris married William Lewis (1835‚Äì1903) in 1869 at Cambrian Cottage, Bertha, the residence of her mother, (Mary Davies). William Lewis was also a Welsh immigrant who had operated the lime kilns in partnership with Ann's stepfather, James Davies. William and Ann Lewis resided at Brighton where William established lime kilns in 1880 and began the Brighton Cement Works, which were officially opened on 12 December 1882. William Lewis produced the first Portland cement in Australia. David Harris, younger brother of Job, married Mary Rebecca Pankhurst at Buchsfeldt, South Australia in 1872. His occupation was listed as a lime burner. In 1875, David was listed as an employee of the Virginia Gold Mining Company, Northern Territory and was a passenger on the SS Gothenburg in February 1875. The steamship left Darwin en route to Adelaide when a cyclone-strength storm was encountered and the SS Gothenburg sank off the north Queensland coast on 24 February 1875. Only 22 men, including David, survived the wreck while 98-112 people died, many being high profile South Australian dignitaries and civil servants. Harris Street in Millner, Darwin is named after David Harris. In 1876, David and his wife Mary moved to Green's Plains (near Kadina, South Australia) as a pioneering farmer. They had 8 children. David died 23 May 1885 and is buried at Kadina. Benjamin George Harris, Job's only sibling born in South Australia, also moved to Green's Plains in 1876 to pioneer and adjoining 1,500 acre scrub block to David's land. Benjamin married Eliza Rosa Harvey in 1876 and they lived at first in a pine and daub home. Benjamin and Eliza had 10 children and Eliza died in 1900 at Kadina and Benjamin died in 1936 at Blackwood, South Australia.The South Australian Advertiser, 9 June 1936, p16. Both are buried at Kadina.  Barossa Goldfields South Australians, along with people from all over the world, had 'rushed' to the rich Victorian goldfields in 1851 and this prompted the South Australian government to offer a reward of ¬£1,000 for major gold finds in this colony. Again in 1863, the South Australian government offered a fresh reward of ¬£5,000 for a payable goldfield. It was not until October 1868 that \\"The South Australian Register\\" of 6 October as well as \\"The South Australian Advertiser\\" reported that \\"On Thursday week last [24th September] a party, including Mr. Job Harris, of the Sandy Creek Hotel, Mr. Gower, and others, set out to explore in the unsold land beyond the Cockatoo Valley. Quietly they set to work in a spot where from previous knowledge of the ground they had reason to look for the colour of gold. They had not been at work many days before they had accumulated a nice little show of nuggets and dust. The first hole was sunk some thirteen feet before their operations attracted much notice.\\" A claim was taken out on 25 September 1868 by Job Harris. one mile north of the South Para River, about five miles from Gawler by the course of the river, and about five miles south- west from Lyndoch. \\"Mr Job Harris's party made their first finding a few yards away from the water in one of the very few flats to be found along the Spike. After going a depth of 13 feet they have left it for the present and joined in the scramble for gold close alongside the waterline.\\" The South Australian Advertiser next reported \\"Mr. Job Harris, landlord of the Sandy Creek Hotel, and claimant of the Government reward for the discovery of a new goldfield, called upon us on Monday morning with 1.25 oz. of beautiful gold.\\" Job Harris was not immediately paid the reward for discovering the goldfield because as \\"The South Australian Advertiser\\" reported on 8 October 1868, \\"...he will have to wait till the conditions attached to the reward are fulfilled, those conditions being that 10,000 ozs. of gold shall be raised, and 500 licences taken out within six months.\\" Eventually enough gold was found to make it possible for Job Harris to claim his reward but only \\"¬£750 was awarded for the discovery of the Barossa diggings [and] was given to Mr. Job Harris and party, six in all, each receiving ¬£125.\\" The largest gold rush ever seen in South Australia began and by the end of the first week after the reports, about 1,500 men were estimated to be on the Barossa goldfields, and by the end of October 1868, it was estimated that 5,000 people were at the diggings. Most of the early diggers lived in basic tents and they had constructed much of their bedding from young wattle trees. Workshops, hotels, stores and booths were soon erected but water was always a problem. On Friday, 9 October 1868, a new company known as the \\"Yatta Creek Gold Reefing Venture\\" with 25 shares was formed at the offices of Messrs. Cullen & Wigley, Solicitors, King William Street, Adelaide. Messrs. Job Harris and Mr. Win. McMinn held shares, \\"free of calls, as those gentlemen started the enterprise\\". In 1873, Job Harris, I. H. Duxbury, John Jones and A. Edwards were the promoters of a new mining company, the \\"Gawler Gold Mining Company\\", Hissey's Gully, Barossa with a nominal capital of ¬£12,000. Twelve thousand shares of (¬£1) one pound each were to be issued, whereof 6,000 shares were to be issued as fully paid-up, and subject to no pecuniary liability to the Promoters. Two new towns, Yatta and Victoria Hill as well as the private township of Barossa which had been established in 1865, were soon booming and contained hotels, butchers and blacksmiths. Barossa had seven hotels, seven general stores and a dozen other establishments as well as an Institute, school and post office. It remained populated until the early 1900s.http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/barossagold.htm By the end of January 1869, a number of crushing companies had been formed \\"The South Australia Advertiser\\" reported on 29 December 1869 that \\"On Monday, December 27, the English and Scottish Bank purchased for ¬£500 a lump of gold in the form of a cup, weighing 130 ozs. 8 dwts., all of which came from the claim of Messrs. Job Harris and company, and was crushed out at the new machine of the Victoria Gold and Quartz Crushing Company.\\" \\"During its first 16 months the Barossa goldfield had produced nearly 11,000 ounces of gold worth ¬£42,000. Some other interesting figures were published on 24th September [1870] when it was revealed that the Barossa field employed a total of 465 diggers, eight carters, ten men at the crushers, one doctor, one policeman, five storekeepers, seven innkeepers, two bakers, two shoemakers and four butchers. There were also 150 women on the field as well as some 300 children. By the end of 1871, the estimated value of gold production from the Barossa goldfield was ¬£180,000.\\" By 1873, the Gawler Gold Mining Company was still operating on the goldfields where Job Harris was doing his utmost to make a success of it... A further small discovery was made in 1880, new companies formed in 1881 and further interest shown in it in 1886 when new technology was available. No gold was officially produced from the Barossa Goldfield in 1887 and most of the diggers had moved away. By 1900, despite small discoveries, the gold rush was considered to have ended.

Biography Wheeler was born in Virginia and moved to Ohio before completing his legal preparation. He moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, where he became a partner of Williamson S. Oldham in law practice. After marrying Emily Walker, he moved in 1839 to San Augustine, Texas, where he was in law practice with future Republic of Texas vice president Kenneth Lewis Anderson. By 1842, Wheeler became a district attorney in Texas, and he was named a district judge and associate judge on the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas three years later. He remained on the Supreme Court as an Associate Justice when Texas was annexed by the United States in 1845, and he became a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas in 1857. That same year, Wheeler was named the founding head of the first iteration of the Baylor Law School. At that time, Baylor was located in Independence, Texas. Fellow faculty members included Robert Emmett Bledsoe Baylor. Early graduates of the school included future Chief Justice of Texas Thomas J. Brown and future state penitentiary superintendent Thomas J. Goree. Wheeler was also on the law school faculty at Austin College. In 1864, saddened by the impending defeat of the South in the Civil War, Wheeler committed suicide in Washington County, Texas. He was succeeded as Chief Justice by Oran Milo Roberts, who later became Governor of Texas. About 15 years after Wheeler's death, Wheeler County, Texas (and a town of the same name) were organized and named after him.

Her main focus areas are extragalactic astronomy and cosmology; she researches black holes and the first stars of the universe. Webster has a doctoral degree from Cambridge University and has held postdoctoral positions at the University of Toronto and University of Melbourne. Early life Rachel Webster was born on 3 July 1951, in North East Victoria. She began her schooling at Tallangatta Primary School and then moved to Melbourne at the age of six, where she attended Blackburn South Primary School and later Presbyterian Ladies College in Melbourne. Her father was an engineer and her mother a geography teacher; both encouraged Webster's interest in physics, science and mathematics from a young age. Webster was inspired to pursue astronomy after she attended a lecture at the University of Sydney in her final year of school. The lecture was on cosmology, presented by Robert May, one of Australia's most celebrated scientists. Career Webster graduated from Monash University in Melbourne in 1975 with a degree in astrophysics. However, let down by her experiences in the university, Webster found herself within the Victorian Government's Public Works department, where she bought and sold real estate. After four years of success in that work, in her mid twenties Webster realised that she was not being completely fulfilled. This lead her to write to Martin Rees, the head of astronomy at Cambridge University, who encouraged her to gain a master's degree in physics prior to being enrolled. Webster completed an MSc at the University of Sussex in 1980 and, in 1985, completed her PhD on Gravitational Lensing and Cosmology at Cambridge University. She then undertook a postdoctoral position at the University of Toronto focussing on the Einstein Cross, a gravitationally lensed quasar. In 1992, Rachel Webster returned to the University of Melbourne, where she received a grant for research related to the Parkes Quasar Survey. She was primarily concerned with how galaxies bend light, known as gravitational lensing. Today, her research group uses equipment including the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Gemini telescopes, the Hubble Telescope and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Webster is a member of the International Consortium, helping to design a new low- frequency radio telescope, to be installed in Western Australia. Webster's ultimate aim is to identify the first sources of the universe. This information is being uncovered via her studies and detection of reionised hydrogen atoms and the structural analysis of neutral hydrogen clouds. She has also conducted research into quasar emission regions, cosmology, the Murchison Widefield Array and dark matter. Webster has been the chair of the National Committee of Astronomy and co-created a Women in Physics Program, which has helped increase the number of women graduating in physics at the University of Melbourne.

Ciddor is a patron for Oz Kids, an organisation to promote and support children's literary and artistic talents.  Biography  Ciddor was born in January 1957 in Melbourne, Australia... She was brought up in a house without television, and had an inventive and creative childhood. She also had a strong interest in mathematics, and after finishing school, she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in mathematics from the University of Melbourne and a Diploma of Education from Melbourne State College. Her first career was as a senior school mathematics teacher, and it was only after marrying and having children that she began writing and illustrating. Her first book accepted for publication was a picture book,Take Me Back, published in 1988. This book took the reader back in time to show how people lived in Australia in the past. For the next few years, Ciddor continued to write and illustrate non-fiction books, concentrating on bringing history to life for children. In 2002 Allen and Unwin published her first historical fantasy, Runestone, book 1 of Viking Magic. This children's novel, and the other Viking Magic books that followed, use historical details and strong storylines. In 2005 Ciddor was awarded a two year grant by the Literature Board of the Australia Council. Ciddor based her fantasy books on global folk, fairy tale, and myth as well as research into historic lifestyle and belief systems. At the Melbourne Writers Festival in 2007 Ciddor appeared on a panel with Sophie Masson and Kate Forsyth discussing the historical truth behind their fantasy novels. In a study of Canadian children's fantasy, author K.V. Johansen included a chapter on Ciddor's Viking Magic books because 'Although not by a Canadian author, the Viking Magic series is noteworthy' and 'does more towards realistic historical fiction than many \\"time-travel to learn history\\" novels' In 2016 Ciddor changed to historical fiction with the release of The Family with Two Front Doors, published by Allen and Unwin. It won a Notable Book Award from the Children's Book Council of Australia in March 2017. The Family with Two Front Doors is based on interviews with the author's grandmother Nomi Rabinovitch, and tells the story of Nomi's childhood as the daughter of a rabbi in 1920s Lublin, Poland. The writing style is inspired by Little House on the Prairie, presenting vignettes of the everyday life of a family. The book combines historical fact and imagination but no fantasy elements. According to a review by the Victorian Association for the Teaching of English, it is \\"an informative, gentle read' that \\"offers insight into how a Jewish household is run\\". Unlike most books about the Jewish past, this one does not focus on the Holocaust and \\"there is... no violence and no hatred... but a charming reconstruction of daily routines\\". Readings Bookstore, winners of the international Bookstore of the Year Award described The Family with Two Front Doors as a modern counterpart to the classic book Little Women. It was published in the USA by Kar-Ben, a division of Lerner Books in 2018, and chosen as a Junior Library Guild Selection. In 2019 it was translated into Polish as Dwoje drzwi i dziewiƒôcioro dzieci and published in Poland by Mamania . Ciddor's most recent book, 52 Mondays, was published by Allen and Unwin in 2019. It is a fictionalised account of Ciddor‚Äôs own childhood, filled with memories of Melbourne in the 1960s. Ciddor has written and illustrated over fifty books.

The abbot, impressed with his abilities, sent him for further studies in Paris and Leuven. From 1575 Sarazin was the delegate of the abbot of St Vaast in the States of the County of Artois, and in that capacity was involved in negotiations relating to the Pacification of Ghent (1576).Herman Vander Linden, \\"Sarrazin (Jean)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique vol. 21 (Brussels, 1913), 402-409. In 1577 he became abbot himself. An edition of the works of Prosper of Aquitaine, printed in Douai by Joannes Bogardus in 1577, was dedicated to Abbot Sarazin, as was Antonius Meyer's Ursus, sive de rebus Divi Vedasti Episcopi Atrebatensis (Paris, Charles Roger, 1580), and much later Philippe Bosquier's Le Fouet de l'Acad√©mie des P√©cheurs (Arras, Guillaume de la Rivi√®re, 1597). Sarazin was active in bringing about the Union of Arras (1579) which was a first step towards reconciling the Walloon provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands to the government of Philip II of Spain. In 1582 he took part in a delegation from the Southern Netherlands to Philip II. A manuscript account of this mission was written by his successor as abbot of St Vaast, Philippe de Caverel, and was published in 1851 as Relation du voyage et de l'ambassade de Jean Sarrazin en Espagne et en Portugal, edited by Louis de Baecker (Bruges, 1851). On 6 March 1596 Sarazin was appointed to the archbishopric of Cambrai in succession to Louis de Berlaymont, being consecrated in Brussels by the apostolic nuncio on 15 December 1596.Hugues Du Tems, Le clerg√© de France, vol. 4 (Paris, 1775), p. 35. He died in Brussels on 3 March 1598 and was buried in the Abbey of St Vaast.

Streptomycetes contain an average G+C content of 70% making them very susceptible to the harmful effects of MC. S. lavendulae has three known genetic loci for resistance to MC. The first genetic locus (mcr) codes for two genes which inactivate MC in vivo through an oxidation process.August PR, Rahn JA, Flickinger MC, Sherman DH. 1996. Inducible synthesis of Mitomycin C resistance gene product (MCRA) from Streptomyces lavendulae. Gene: An International Journal on Genes and Genomes. 175:261-267.

History  The Nanjing National Theatre Academy was founded in the fall of 1935 by Fang Chih as an organ of the KMT Central Propaganda Department. Fang, working on behalf of the CC Clique, a powerful faction of the Kuomintang, envisioned the school as China's first ever institute of higher education in the field of drama espousing the principals of the New Life Movement. The New Life Movement was the brainchild of General Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling with the backing of the Blue Shirts Society, the KMT's extreme right wing. The original campus was located at the southeast corner of the intersection of Sanyong Lane (zh: ÂèåÈæôÂ∑∑) and Nanjing Gulu (zh: Âçó‰∫¨ÈºìÊ•º).  War  With the outbreak of World War Two, the school moved briefly to Changsha and then to Chungking. In 1938 or 1939, the school moved to Jiang Country, Sichuan Province. In 1940, the name of the school was changed to the National Theatre College (zh: ÂõΩÁ´ãÊàèÂâß‰∏ìÁßëÂ≠¶Ê†°) as a branch of the Ministry of Education where Fang Chih was the Chairman of the Transitional National Government Committee. In 1945, the school again relocated briefly to Chungking where Fang was the municipality's party chief before being relocated permanently to Nanking. After the fall of the Kuomintang government in the Chinese Civil War, the Nanjing Theatre Academy merged with the drama department of the Lu Xun Art Academy to form the Central Academy of Drama (zh: ‰∏≠Â§ÆÊàèÂâßÂ≠¶Èô¢) by order of Mao Zedong. Today, the Central Academy of Drama is one of the most prestigious drama school in the PRC together with the Beijing Film Academy and the Shanghai Theatre Academy.

If he is not better known to the general public, it is because his career, confined to art song and the concert stage, has not brought him the wider renown of singers who make their careers in opera; but he has long been cherished by connoisseurs of vocal music for the pure lyric sweetness of his voice and his scrupulous musicianship. He began performing Irish songs on the radio in 1942 at the age of six on programs like Coast to Coast on a Bus and The Fred Allen Show; earning the nickname the \\"little John McCormack\\". In the late 1950s he embarked on a career as a concert tenor, and achieved great success as an exponent of early music by such composers as Handel, Bach, and Monteverdi during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. He has performed in concerts with several major orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein and the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy, and has performed at the White House for Presidents John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter. In the mid 1970s White returned to his roots as a performer of Irish songs, and achieved fame internationally as an 'Irish tenor,' drawing comparison to John McCormack; he even performed on programs for BBC television in honor of the late tenor. He continues to perform in concerts with a diverse repertoire ranging from Irish ballads to opera to contemporary art songs and works from the classical tenor canon. Several composers have written works specifically for him, including Mark Adamo, William Bolcom, John Corigliano, Lukas Foss, Stephen Hough, Libby Larsen, Lowell Liebermann, Gian Carlo Menotti, Tobias Picker, Ned Rorem, and David Del Tredici. He has made several recordings for RCA Victor Records, mainly of Irish songs and ballads, and has also recorded a diverse repertoire for Virgin Classics, EMI, and Hyperion. A former faculty member of Hunter College and the Manhattan School of Music, he currently teaches on the voice faculty of the Juilliard School. He also works periodically as an interviewer for the radio station WQXR-FM. Early life and education Born in the Bronx, White was the fifth of six children born to tenor, composer, and radio actor Joseph White and lyricist Maureen O'Byrne White. His mother was originally from Galway, Ireland, and his father was the grandson of an Irish immigrant from Kerry. His father achieved fame portraying the title role on the NBC Radio program The Silver-Masked Tenor; a program for which he also composed many of the songs. White's mother Maureen was his father's lyricist. White began performing on WJZ radio at the age of 6 under the name Bobby White, and recorded his first album, Ring of Gold, at the age of 7. He usually performed Irish folk songs and ballads on the radio, and was dubbed by Milton Cross as \\"our own little John McCormack.\\" Some of the radio programs he performed on were Coast to Coast on a Bus; Irene Wicker, the Singing Lady; and The Fred Allen Show. On the latter show he became acquainted with The DeMarco Sisters, with whom he was notably trapped for four days during the North American blizzard of 1947. He also had the opportunity to perform with such legendary entertainers as Humphrey Bogart, Bing Crosby, and Frank Sinatra on Allen's program. By the age of 12 he was performing challenging tenor songs with full orchestras on NBC radio, such as 'Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life' from Victor Herbert's Naughty Marietta. White's initial training as a singer was established through lessons with his father. His skills were also sharpened as a chorister at St. Jerome's Church in the Bronx. He earned a Bachelor of Music in vocal performance from Hunter College. He then pursued studies in Germany, Italy, and at the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau in France with Gerard Souzay and Nadia Boulanger. He went on to earn a Master of Music in vocal performance from the Juilliard School in 1968 where he was a pupil of Beverley Peck Johnson.

The last extension north of US 84 occurred on September 27, 1960 with FM 489 being routed over previously unnumbered roads. FM 490 Farm to Market Road 490 (FM 490) is a farm to market road across South Texas in the counties of Starr, Hidalgo, and Willacy. Beginning at FM 755 between Rio Grande City and La Gloria, the road heads east through a rural area comprising farm lands and oil wells. The road eventually leaves Starr County for Hidalgo and comes to the community of McCook where some small businesses, homes, and churches are found. In this town, a concurrency begins with FM 681. In the vicinity of the road's interchange with I-69C/US 281, it briefly enters the Edinburg city limits and passes the entrance to South Texas International Airport at Edinburg. East of here, the road begins to make successive 90-degree bends but still maintains an overall heading of east. The final town in Hidalgo County through which FM 490 passes is Hargill where it intersects FM 493. The remainder of the road through Willacy County passes mainly through unincorporated rural areas no passing through any settlements, though it does pass near Lasara at its intersection with FM 1015. It also passes near Raymondville where it crosses US 77 Bus. Surrounding this intersection are some large stores and housing complexes. East of this intersection, FM 490 has an interchange with I-69E and US 77. later, the road ends at FM 1420 near the settlement of Willamar. FM 490 was created on June 26, 1945 running from its intersection with US 281 to the Hidaldo-Willacy county line. On November 11, 1948, it was slightly extended east to FM 88. The next extension occurred on October 31, 1957 when it was extended over the entire length of FM 2059 to end at FM 681. On February 15, 1958, FM 490 was extended over FM 1561 to end at FM 755. FM 490 was extended east from FM 88 to FM 2099 on May 6, 1964 over the entire length of FM 1432. The final eastward extension to FM 1420 occurred on June 1, 1965. Major junctions FM 491 Farm to Market Road 491 (FM 491) is a farm to market road in Hidalgo and Willacy counties in the southernmost portion of Texas. It runs between Relampago and US 281 ( from the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border) and US 77 Bus. just south of Lyford. It begins heading north from US 281 through agricultural lands. Upon entering the city of Mercedes, it forms a concurrency with US 83 Bus. west through the city's downtown. After the concurrency, the road heads north where it has an interchange with I-2 and US 83. Passing through residential neighborhoods of northern Mercedes, Indian Hills, and Laguna Seca, the road continues north with some curves around canals that line the area. In the city of La Villa, FM 491 intersects SH 107 in the city center. North of this city, the road make numerous 90-degree bends as it finishes its trip through Hidalgo County and starts traveling through Willacy County. After intersecting numerous farm to market roads, the road ends at US 77 Bus. immediately adjacent to a Union Pacific railroad. The road was designated on June 26, 1945 to run between SH 107 in La Villa and US 77 (now the highway's business route). It was extended south to US 281 on May 23, 1951 via Mercedes and replacing FM 1428. FM 491 was routed through Mercedes on 10th Street and Texas Avenue; a spur to US 83 via Mistletoe Avenue was added on November 20, 1951. The routing through the city was changed on March 27, 1952 by removing the portion of 10th Street and Texas Avenue south of US 83 (part of its business route today) and routing the mainline via the spur road. The road has remained the same since then. Major junctions FM 492 Farm to Market Road 492 (FM 492) is a farm to market road entirely in Hidalgo County, in the southern portion of the state. The highway begins at an intersection with Goodwin Road and US 83 Bus. in the city of Palmview. It heads north along Goodwin Road and after intersecting the frontage roads of Interstate 2/US 83, the highway exits the city limits of Palmview and jogs to the right at Three Mile Road and FM 1924 before traveling north again on Doffing Road. It intersects FM 676 at the latter's western terminus before FM 492 terminates at FM 2221 (Mile 7 Road). The highway was created on June 26, 1945 running from what is still its southern terminus (though the intersecting highway was mainline US 83 at the time) north for to Three Mile Road. On May 23, 1951, the road was extended north to its current northern terminus and then east along current FM 2221 to FM 681. On January 7, 1987, the east-west portion between FM 2221 and FM 681 was transferred to FM 2221 leaving FM 492 on its current routing. The portion of FM 492 south of FM 1924 was designated as Urban Road 492 on June 27, 1995 but continued to be signed as FM 492. On November 15, 2018, the portion south of FM 1924 was changed back to FM 492. FM 493 Farm to Market Road 493 (FM 493) is in length and is located entirely in Hidalgo County. It begins at the Donna‚ÄìR√≠o Bravo International Bridge where state maintenance begins. Starting out as a four-lane divided highway, the road heads east then turns to the north intersecting US 281. North of here, the road narrows to two lanes and travels through agricultural land. Before entering the city of Donna, the number of residential complexes surrounding the road increases. Inside the city, the road widens to four lanes again (but undivided) surrounded by residential neighborhoods. After crossing US 83 Bus., the road heads through a commercial district in the city. North of its interchange with I-2 and US 83, the road remains four lanes wide and passes through a mix of residences and farm lane. The road narrows to two lanes before curving to due north. In the census designated place of La Blanca, the road crosses SH 107. The mix of houses and farms is still present as the road passes FM 1925 and has a short concurrency with FM 2812. Residences dwindle north of the concurrency except when FM 493 reaches the community of Hargill where it intersects FM 490 in the town center. The road comes to an end at SH 186 near tracts of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge and the Willacy County line. FM 493 was created on June 26, 1945 as a road connecting Donna with Run School, about south of the city. On January 8, 1957, the road was expanded northward on a new alignment of the road to US 83 and northward to Hargill at FM 490, replacing FM 890. A extension of the road to SH 186 north of Hargill occurred on September 27, 1960 with the road not changing since then. Major junctions FM 494 Farm to Market Road 494 (FM 494) is a J-shaped farm to market road in Hidalgo County near the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. The road begins at FM 1016 in Mission, about from the Rio Grande and the international border. FM 494 begins heading southeast paralleling a Rio Valley Switching Company railroad before it crosses the railroad and continues to the southeast. After passing under FM 396 and the Anzalduas International Bridge, FM 494 enters the city limits of Granjeno before curving to the north and passing through a small portion of McAllen and back into Mission. It intersects FM 1016 again before continuing north on Shary Road through Mission. In Mission, there are intersections with I-2/US 83's frontage roads, US 83 Bus., and SH 495. North of Mission, the highway passes through the city of Palmhurst where it intersects FM 1924. It also briefly follows the eastern border of Alton in the vicinity of FM 676. FM 494 ends at SH 107. The highway was created on June 26, 1945 as a spur south from SH 107. On April 20, 1954, the road was extended further south to Mission at what was then US 83 (now US 83 Bus.) for a total length of and further extended to FM 1016 (the current easternmost intersection with FM 1016) on December 14, 1956. The loop through Granjeno was added on July 11, 1968. Except for a small extension at its southern end (western intersection with FM 1016) in 1986, the highway has not had any major changes since then. On June 27, 1995, the entire road was redesignated as Urban Road 494 though it continued to be signed as FM 494. On November 15, 2018, the entire road was redesignated back to FM 494. FM 495 Farm to Market Road 495 (FM 495) was the designation of the highway now known as SH 495 in Hidalgo County. The farm to market road was first designated on June 26, 1945 in the McAllen vicinity and had numerous extensions applied to it throughout its history. In June 1995, the entire road was designated as Urban Road 495 though signage continued to show it as a farm to market road. The entire road in June 2001, which at the time had a length of , was redesignated as a state highway. However, at least one light still shows the street as FM 495. FM 496 Farm to Market Road 496 (FM 496) is a farm to market road in Zapata County near the Rio Grande and Mexican border. Beginning at the start of pavement about from the river bank, it heads northeast first past FM 3074, a road that heads to the community of Falcon Mesa. FM 496 continues northeast past some light industrial businesses and a cemetery. At this point, the two- lane road enters the community of Zapata and expands to four-lanes wide. The road travels for three blocks before ending at an intersection with US 83 and SH 16 which begins ahead. Upon its designation on July 9, 1945, the road included all of what comprises FM 496 now and SH 16 to the Jim Hogg County line. On August 13, 1945, the road was extended much further along modern SH 16 to Hebbronville. It was extended to a total length of on October 31, 1957, when FM 496 was extended from Hebbronville to Freer. It was shortened to its current length on September 31, 1965 when SH 16 was extended over the road between Zapata to Freer. FM 497 Farm to Market Road 497 (FM 497) was a farm to market road in Willacy County traveling from San Perlita to the Red Fish Bay at Port Mansfield. The highway started in downtown San Perlita when it was designated on July 9, 1945, but its western starting point was moved to south of the city on November 23, 1948. On May 31, 1973, FM 497 was signed (but not designated) as SH 186. This alignment of the road lasted until August 29, 1990 when it was officially designated as SH 186. FM 498 Farm to Market Road 498 (FM 498) is a farm to market road in southern Willacy County. The highway travels from the intersection of Olive Road and US 77 Bus. in Lyford east through the county before ending at FM 1420 in Willamar.

This greatly enhances the ICBM's chance of survival in a direct nuclear strike, which enables their use in a second strike unlike ICBMs based in static nuclear silos which generally do not survive a direct nuclear attack. A report written by a Georgetown University team led by Phillip Karber conducted a three-year study to map out China‚Äôs complex tunnel system, which stretches 5,000 km (3,000 miles). The report determined that the stated Chinese nuclear arsenal is understated and as many as 3,000 nuclear warheads may be stored in the tunnel network.http://www.powerandpolicy.com/2012/01/31/chinas-underground-great- wall-subterranean-ballistic- missile/#.VlJzD3arSUkhttp://archive.defensenews.com/article/20130105/DEFREG02/301050003/New- U-S-Law-Seeks-Answers-Chinese-Nuke-Tunnels This hypothetical maximum storage or basing capacity along with Karber's own misconceived fissile production suggestions,Collected Thoughts on Phil Karber by Jeffrey Lewis December 7, 2011 resulted in Western media purporting that 3,000 warheads were actually in the facility.

Austria (26958/95) was a 2001 European Court of Human Rights case. Context Mrs Susanne Jerusalem was a member of the Vienna Municipal Council (Gemeinderat), which also acts as the Regional Parliament (Landtag). She was prohibited from repeating the following statements made in the course of a session of the Council: \\"Like everyone else, I know that today a sect no longer means a small group that breaks away from a big church ..., but a psycho-sect. These psycho-sects also exist in Vienna. They have common features. One aspect they have in common is their totalitarian character. Moreover, in their ideology, they show fascist tendencies and often have hierarchical structures. In general, a person who gets involved with such a sect loses his identity and submits to the group (..) the sect IPM, which has not long been in existence in Austria but which has existed for several years in Switzerland, where it is called the VPM, has had a certain influence on the drugs policy of the Austrian People‚Äôs Party\\". Austrian Supreme Court considered the statements such as ‚Äúfascist tendencies‚Äù or ‚Äútotalitarian character‚Äù to be statements of fact which Mrs Jerusalem had failed to prove. Judgment The European Court of Human Rights noted that \\"the IPM and the VPM were associations active in a field of public concern, namely drug policy. They participated in public discussions on this matter and, as the Government conceded, cooperated with a political party. Since the associations were active in this manner in the public domain, they ought to have shown a higher degree of tolerance to criticism\\". Besides, it found that \\"the impugned statements in the present case, reflecting as they did fair comment on matters of public interest by an elected member of the Municipal Council, are to be regarded as value judgments rather than statements of fact\\". After a conclusion that \\"in requiring the applicant to prove the truth of her statements, while at the same time depriving her of an effective opportunity to adduce evidence to support her statements and thereby show that they constituted fair comment, the Austrian courts overstepped their margin of appreciation and that the injunction granted against the applicant amounted to a disproportionate interference with her freedom of expression\\", the Court found Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights to be violated.

Description and history  It was built in the 1820s by James Walker. The colonnaded Greek Revival house was bought by Henry W. Collier, who became chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and in 1849 became the Governor of Alabama, serving two terms. Following the American Civil War the house was occupied by former Confederate General Phillip Dale Roddey. After a number of other transactions the house became the headquarters of the Associated Charities of Tuscaloosa before returning to private ownership. The two-story frame house rests on a brick foundation with a two-story columned portico across the entire front of the house.

He was formerly a proprietor of iron and steel factory, and was a millionaire. He claims that the loss of his dog in 2012 compelled him to devote his resources for saving dogs. From that year he started a rescue centre for dogs in Helong city. As of 2015, he claims he has helped rescuing more than 2,000 stray dogs, and is keeping over 200 dogs at his centre. He maintains he has spent all his money and has turned bankrupt.  Activism  Wang claims to have started to make a successful business around 2005, when the steel industry in China was improved. Wang says that when he lost his dog, after several failed investigations, someone suggested him to look into the city slaughterhouse. He spent a week in the slaughterhouse, but to no avail. Instead, Wang maintains his observation of the appalling slaughter practices led him to work for animal welfare. Dog meats are sold in the market, and these meat mainly come from stray dogs. The butchering of dogs for meat is a traditional business, and China has been known for its dog meat. There is even a Lychee and Dog Meat Festival (or Yulin Dog Meat Festival) in which 10,000-15,000 dogs are consumed every year. The local government of a Dayang district in Shandong province even attempted to annihilate all dogs, including licensed pets. In September 2015, the government issue an order that \\"All dogs must be removed from the district, otherwise authorities will enter your house and kill your dog on the spot.\\" More than 5,000 dogs are exterminated. Wang purchased the slaughterhouse and an abandoned steel factory in Helong town, Changchun, which he developed as a rescue centre for stray dogs. He named it the \\"Changchun Animal Rescue Base\\". He claims to have expanded the premise to house at least 1000 dogs at a time. He asserts that he started spending his financial resources for dog food and medications without any gain. He alleges his expenditures have cost over three million yuan ($470,186). He says he persuades people to adopt his stray dogs, but would not accept any donation for himself. He only appreciates food for his dogs as a gift.

The tunnel was on the main line of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad, commonly known as \\"The Milwaukee Road.\\" The pass is on the Bitterroot Range of northwestern Montana and the Idaho Panhandle. The Milwaukee Road crossed under it in the St. Paul Pass Tunnel, also known as the Taft Tunnel, completed in 1908; its length is at above sea level at East Portal in Montana. The pass above the tunnel is at an elevation of . The East Portal is southwest of exit 5 of Interstate 90. With ongoing financial problems which worsened in the 1970s, the Milwaukee line abandoned its right-of-way in the West in 1980, but the tunnel and its approach grades have been revived as a rail trail route for hikers and bicyclists, the Route of the Hiawatha Trail.  Selection of route and construction  The tunnel was constructed as part of the Milwaukee Road's \\"Pacific Coast Extension\\" project, undertaken in the first decade of the 1900s. It expanded its concentration of railroad lines in the upper Midwest area of Milwaukee-Chicago-Minneapolis-St. Paul across the Rocky Mountains to Washington, ending at the Seattle-Tacoma area on Puget Sound. The construction occurred late in the historical era of American railroading; it was the last transcontinental line built. Surveying began in 1901 and continued until 1909, when a final golden spike was driven in Montana at The St. Paul Pass route was surveyed from Butte starting in August 1906 and continuing through November, using the tools of the era: transit, stadia rod, surveying chain, and barometer. The Milwaukee Road was committed to a route with no more than a 2.2 percent grade, and the surveying west of Butte to the St. Paul Pass was thorough and extensive; it covered some in order to select a route of . in spite of this diligent work, the surveyors and engineers only achieved a grade of 1.7% grade from Haugan on the east to Avery on the west in Idaho. This grade was vastly inferior to the Northern Pacific and Great Northern routes from Missoula and Whitefish respectively which had lines to and from Spokane not exceeding 1 percent. Exiting the west portal in Idaho, the route descends through several shorter tunnels, to Avery at just under , and on down the St. Joe River another The St. Paul Pass was chosen because of the stands of marketable white pine timber and also because there were no other competing railroads nearby. The contract work for the building of the tunnel was done by Winston Brothers Company of Minneapolis, with the primary subcontract work carried out by contractors W.B. Cronk, A.D. McDougal & Company, Stewart and Welch, and Street & Lusk. Grading toward the pass began from Missoula in July 1906, and about this same time work began on both approaches to the tunnel, with the approaches being completed in 1906. Heavy boring began in 1907, and the tunnel was officially completed in December 1908. The Milwaukee line recorded the tunnel as \\"#20\\" since it numbered its tunnels from east to west. The tunnel's official length was , it was the second-longest on the Milwaukee main line from Chicago to Seattle, behind only the 2¬º-mile Snoqualmie Tunnel in Washington.  Decline and abandonment  Because the Pacific Extension was built without federal land grant assistance that earlier transcontinental railroads had received as an incentive, its construction costs particularly for right of way acquisition, ran significantly over budget. The route by- passed some major population centers and passed through other areas of limited local traffic, which reduced prospective traffic revenues. Because operation of steam locomotives over the mountain passes was difficult, in 1914 and 1915 the line underwent an electrification process in two sections, one over the Rocky Mountains (1914‚àí1915) and the other over the Cascades (1917) extended to Seattle in 1927, which further deepened cost overruns. The extension became a long haul route. During its history, the Milwaukee offered high speed passenger trains from Chicago and twin cities area to the Tacoma and Seattle area, the well-known Olympian Hiawatha. Throughout its life, the initial overrun of costs for the Pacific Extension left the Milwaukee Road plagued by financial trouble. The depression and several unsuccessful receiverships followed by the general decline of railroad traffic in the 1950s, followed by the consolidation of larger railroads finally caused the Milwaukee to abandon its entire trackage system in the Idaho-Montana area in 1980.  Rail trail  The abandoned tunnel sat dormant and empty for more than twenty years, then it was included in the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company Historic District. The St. Paul Tunnel route was officially ‚Äòrededicated‚Äô on June 23, 2001, as part of the Route of the Hiawatha rail trail. Tours are available, or one can simply walk or take a bike through the tunnel from portal to portal, and the tunnel sees thousands of hikers and bikers annually. Along with the St. Paul Tunnel, there are other bridges and tunnels intact on the Idaho approaches to St. Paul Pass, as are part of the \\"gallows\\" structures that bore the overhead wires for the electric trains, and some signs and signals along the right of way. A similar Milwaukee Road rail trail in Washington through the Cascades, Iron Horse State Park, includes the Snoqualmie Tunnel.  Taft  The tunnel under the St. Paul Pass was also known as the Taft Tunnel, after the Montana boom town of Taft, (1907‚àí1910) which sprang up at the east portal of the tunnel during construction. It had a short but colorful history, and was allegedly named after President William Howard Taft, who visited the work camp while Secretary of War under President Theodore Roosevelt; he chastised the town as a \\"sewer of sin\\" and \\"a sore on an otherwise beautiful national forest.\\" Either out of jest or spite, the town named itself after Taft. It was the last of the wide-open towns that followed railroad construction (see Hell on Wheels). The town sprang up after the end of the \\"wild west\\" era, and drew people who were leaving communities which were increasingly turning to law and order; it also attracted those returning from the gold rushes in Alaska, and became a den of criminals and vice. A long distance from the nearest county seat, then at Missoula, and the county sheriff and deputies let Taft develop as it would in anticipation that it would have a short life. It extended along a half-mile (0.8 km) stretch of right-of-way track and peaked at about three thousand denizens. Taft had between twenty and fifty saloons, and the second biggest profession after \\"railroad worker\\" was prostitution. In the spring, the melting banks of snow in the mountain town meant the discovery of dead bodies, and allegedly during the final spring of 1909, as many as seventeen bodies were found. Buildings in Taft had been hastily constructed of wood and were flimsy. After experiencing a few smaller fires, Taft was destroyed by the 1910 \\"Big Burn\\" forest fires that extended over much of the Idaho Panhandle and western Montana. As the fire approached Taft, the remaining residents ignored a call to join firefighters, drank up what they could in the saloons and hastily left on an evacuation train. The residents had mostly \\"squatted\\" on national forest land, and forest rangers suppressed any effort to rebuild the town. By this time, the railroad construction workers had moved on, and with them the money. After the fire, the railroad named the same area \\"East Portal\\" and it had an electric substation after electrification of the line in about 1914. The few remaining abandoned buildings were buried by the construction of Interstate 90 in 1962, and now nothing remains but its name; on I-90 is named \\"Taft.\\" See also * Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad * Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company Historic District * Bitterroot Range * Route of the Hiawatha Trail References External links * Description of \\"Route of the Hiawatha\\" mountain bike or hike trail at the St. Paul Pass Tunnel * Using Tranz Simulator view, a YouTube video simulating a Milwaukee training running over the St. Paul Pass route. * \\"tripadvisor\\" comment on \\"Hiawatha Mountain Bike Trail\\" with some photos. *\\"Route of the Hiawatha\\" by \\"TrailLink\\". * - (2003) Mountain passes of Montana Mountain passes of Idaho Rail mountain passes of the United States Railroad tunnels in Montana Railroad tunnels in Idaho Geography of Mineral County, Montana ","title":"St. Paul Pass Tunnel"},{"id":"48626636","text":"Eremophila arachnoides is a plant in the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae and is endemic to a few arid areas of Western Australia and South Australia. It is a little-known, broom-shaped shrub with white to mauve, trumpet-shaped flowers which are densely hairy on the inside. Description Eremophila arachnoides grows to a height of and a width of with leaves and stems densely covered with short, soft hairs. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs at almost 90¬∞ to the stem, mostly long, wide, linear, oval in cross section or almost circular with the upper surface having a channel in the centre. The flowers are borne singly or in pairs in leaf axils on stalks long. There are 5 triangular sepals which are similar in size to each other and are about long. The tube formed by the petals is long and is white to pale pink, blue or mauve on the outside with yellow or purple spots on the inside. The inside and outside of the tube as well as the lobes are densely hairy. The petals lobes are pointed and are all equal in length. There are four stamens which do not extend beyond the end of the tube. Flowering occurs between August and December and is followed by fruit which is soft and an oval shape, about and changes colour from pale green to a delicate pink as it matures. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 1979 and the description was published in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. The type specimen was collected by Chinnock about south east of Yarrabubba homestead. The specific epithet is from Latin, meaning 'cobwebby', alluding to the long hairs in the corolla tube. Two subspecies are recognised by the Australian Plant Census: *Eremophila arachnoides Chinnock subsp. arachnoides, commonly known as spider web eremophila, which has distinctly hairy leaves; *Eremophila arachnoides subsp. tenera Chinnock , commonly known as slender-leaved eremophila, has glabrous leaves. The epithet tenera is from the Latin meaning 'slender', referring to the long, slender leaves. Distribution and habitat Subspecies arachnoides occurs in small, isolated areas east of Kumarina in the Murchison biogeographic region where it grows in shallow limestone soils. Eremophila arachnoides subsp. tenera occurs mainly in scattered places in the west of South Australia but there are also disjunct populations central Western Australia. This subspecies grows in red loamy soils on calcrete. Conservation status Subspecies arachnoides is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Eremophila arachnoides subsp. tenera is classified as \\"Priority One\\" meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk. Use in horticulture This eremophila has attractive foliage and flowers and the coloured fruits add to its appeal. It tolerates a wide variety of soils and prefers full sun although it will grow in partial shade and is very drought tolerant and frost resistant. It can be propagated from cuttings which may take several months to form roots and it can also be grafted onto Myoporum. After a few years, light pruning can be used to keep its shape compact.

She served as the sixth First Lady of Alaska during the tenure of her former husband, Alaska Governor Steve Cowper. Stewart established and launched the state reading program, \\"Look to a Book\\", as First Lady. Biography =Early life= Michael Margaret Stewart was born in Paris, France, on December 28, 1952, to Margaret and Colonel William Stewart. Colonel Stewart, was a U.S. Air Force military attach√© to NATO at the time, had married Margaret, who was British, in 1950, two years before her birth. Her parents named her Michael, an unusual first name for a girl, after a family friend, while her middle name came from her mother. Stewart's mother died from breast cancer when she was young. The Stewart family returned to the United States and settled in Santa Monica, California, where Michael Stewart attended Lincoln Junior High School and Santa Monica High School. Following her father's retirement, the family relocated to Santa Barbara to manage her grandfather's family orchid horticultural business . Stewart would reside in Santa Barbara for the majority of her life. Her father and stepmother later moved to her grandfather's former vacation home in Hope Ranch, California, an upscale suburb of Santa Barbara. Michael Margaret Stewart graduated from Santa Barbara College of Law when she was 31 years old. Her first marriage, to Justin Hodges, ended in divorce. =First Lady of Alaska= Stewart met her second husband, Steve Cowper, at a New Year's Eve party at Nipper's Club in Montecito, California, in 1984. Cowper was an Alaskan politician who was preparing for his second gubernatorial campaign, following an unsuccessful bid for Governor of Alaska in 1982. Stewart and Cowper soon married and moved to Alaska. In 1986, Cowper announced his second candidacy for Governor of Alaska. He defeated incumbent Governor Bill Sheffield in the Democratic primary election on August 26, 1986. Stewart gave birth to the couple's son and only child, Wade Cowper, was born on August 29, 1986, just three days after the primary. The birth of their son attracted widespread public attention during the election campaign. Cowper won the four-way general election in November 1986. Stewart focused on literacy and rural healthcare during her four years as First Lady of Alaska. The government of Alaska was facing acute economic shortfalls during the Cowper administration, as oil prices fell sharply. Stewart approached private companies and individuals for funding, rather than requesting public tax dollars, for her literacy initiatives. As First Lady, she donated book sets to all 383 elementary schools in Alaska at the time. Stewart launched her signature program, \\"Look to a Book,\\" in 1989 to promote children's reading and literacy, particular in more remote, rural and Native Alaskan villages in the state. She received a State Reading Association Literacy Award for her work to promote reading. A video produced on behalf of her \\"Look to a Book\\" received a national award from the Children‚Äôs Television Workshop. She also traveled throughout Alaska on behalf of the Cowper administration's Health Care Commission, which focused on educational accountability and drew-up almost fifty recommendations to alleviate economic and social problems. By the late 1980s, approximately one-third of Alaska's population was age 18 or younger, posing a demographic challenge. Stewart oversaw the creation of the Commission on Children and Youth to promote child care, as well as the battle against high rates of substance abuse and teen suicide. Stewart's mother had died from breast cancer. As a preventative measure, Stewart underwent a double mastectomy about halfway through her tenure as First Lady. She went public with her surgery, encouraging discussions on women's health. Stewart also served as a goodwill ambassador for the state. She accompanied state gubernatorial trade missions to China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, as well as the Soviet Union, which had opened business opportunities to Alaska during Perestroika. =Law practice and later life= In 1989, Governor Cowper announced that he would not seek re-election in the 1990 gubernatorial election. The family moved to Santa Barbara, California, shortly after Cowper left office. Michael Margaret Stewart and Steve Cowper divorced in 1991. Michael Margaret Stewart continued to practice law in Santa Barbara and raised her son, Wade Cowper, who also became a California lawyer for a nonprofit. Stewart initially worked with colleagues Jackie Misho and Anna Karczag. She then partnered with Marty Cohn, specializing in family law for almost ten years, until a few months before her death in 2015. In April 2015, Stewart was given a prognosis of three to six months to live due to ovarian cancer. Michael Margaret Stewart died from the disease at Serenity House, a hospice in Santa Barbara on October 22, 2015, at the age of 62. Governor Bill Walker of Alaska ordered that all flags be lowered to half staff in Stewart's honor.

Wild and scenic designation The upper of the North Fork, from the upstream boundary of the North Fork Owyhee Wilderness to the Idaho‚ÄìOregon border, are part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Of this total, are classified as wild and the remaining are recreational. The lower of the North Fork, from the Idaho‚ÄìOregon border to the main stem, is also classified as wild. It flows through a deep canyon rimmed with basalt. The Bureau of Land Management oversees the land along the river in both states. Camping The BLM operates North Fork Campground, about southeast of Jordan Valley, Oregon. Amenities include seven primitive campsites, picnic tables, fire grates, and a vault toilet but no drinking water. Wilderness In 2009, the United States Congress designated the wilderness, which covers about in the Idaho portion of the North Fork watershed. It extends from the headwaters in Idaho almost to the border with Oregon. Managed by the BLM, it includes river canyons that are more than deep as well as large expanses of plateau. The wilderness is home to sage grouse, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, rare plants, and many other species. The wilderness is about southwest of Boise.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and education. It was nominated for its Neoclassical/Georgian Revival architecture by Orff & Guilbert and for its status as the oldest surviving public school building in Stillwater. Description Nelson School is a two-story building with a square footprint. It has red brick walls over a raised foundation of limestone blocks. The front fa√ßade has three distinct bays set off by pilasters. The central bay is slightly recessed with an oriel window jutting from the second story. The flanking bays bear slabs inscribed with the building's name and construction date which, like the oriel, are framed with pilasters and topped with a semicircular pediment. The central bay contains the main entrance on the ground floor and a dormer on the roof with a triangular pediment. The building's side walls have a row of ten windows on both floors, while the rear wall is blank but for an oriel window. The building's square plan was an economical design allowing for four classrooms on each floor. Moreover, the lack of windows on the front and rear fa√ßades intentionally provided three full walls within each classroom for blackboards. History The original Nelson School was a one-story wood-frame structure built in 1885. The school was named for Socrates Nelson, who owned the land where it was built. Its student body quickly outgrew the space, so a new facility was constructed on the same site in 1897. The property's National Register nomination attributes the building to the architectural firm of Orff & Guilbert, but a more recent description credits a different partnership of Fremont D. Orff, Orff & Joralemon. Within two months of opening for classes, a fire broke out in the building and caused $5,000 worth of damage. The entire building had cost $17,000 to construct. In addition to public education, the building provided civic meeting space. Nelson School last hosted classes in the 1950s, when the public school district converted it into administrative offices. The school district moved out completely in 1976. The vacant building, remanded to city ownership, was threatened with demolition but historic preservation efforts culminating in a court ruling that prevented that fate. Local investors purchased it in 1980 and conducted a successful adaptive reuse project to convert Nelson School into a multi-unit residential building.

Epigenetics and Environment. In Brian Keith Hall, Roy Douglas Pearson, Gerd B. M√ºller. In Environment, Development, and Evolution: Toward a Synthesis. MIT Press. p. 19. According to science historian Peter J. Bowler the idea held by Cunningham that hormones transferred from one generation to the next independent of the germ plasm was seen at the time by neo-Lamarckians as a plausible hypothesis, however \\"its advocates were unable to get beyond the stage of providing indirect evidence for the effect they postulated.\\"Bowler, Peter J.

Experiments In a series of experiments (in 1891, 1893 and 1895) on the action of light on the coloration of flatfish, Cunningham directed light upon the lower sides of flatfishes by means of a glass-bottomed tank placed over a mirror. He discovered that light causes the production of pigments on the lower sides of flatfishes, and gave his results a Lamarckian interpretation. Other scientists interpreted his results differently. Review of Modern Biology (1928) by J. T. Cunningham. George Romanes wrote approvingly of Cunningham's interpretation, but the geneticist William Bateson was not convinced that the cause of the increase in pigmentation was from the illumination. Thomas Hunt Morgan criticized the experiments and did not believe the results were evidence for Lamarckism.

It gathered major personalities of Albanian literature and writing of the time, and was formed with the aim of defining a fixed literary standard and orthographic rules for the Albanian language which were lacking at the moment, in order to encourage the publication of schooltexts. Facsimile of one of the process-verbals of the Commission. Session held on 16 September 1916 (date shows on top of the document) History The commission started officially on 1 September 1916 with the initiative of the Austrian diplomat August Ritter von Kral. Some of the notable members were Gjergj Fishta, Luigj Gurakuqi, Hil√´ Mosi, Aleksander Xhuvani, Maximilian Lambertz, Gjergj Pekmezi, Ndre Mjeda, Sotir Pe√ßi, and Mati Logoreci. The members agreed on the necessity of having an orthography standard \\"as phonetic as possible\\" and a unified literary language which would preserve what the Albanian dialects had in common and leave out any stigmatized regional forms. Fishta played a leading role in the commission. He tried hard to push for the dialect of Shkod√´r to form the base of the Albanian standard, in respect to the cultural contribution that writers and literature in the dialect had given to Albanian culture at that time, \\"much as Dante's language had served for literary Italian. Regardless of Fishta's influence and the fact that other founding members were from Shkod√´r as well, he did not succeed. Under the influence of Aleksander Xhuvani who proclaimed that \\"the unity of the language is the unity of the nation\\" (), the Commission accepted the dialect of Elbasan to be used as the basis for standard Albanian. While being a Gheg dialect, it is a southern one and closest possible to the Tosk dialect. The standard was adopted by the Educational Congress of Lushnje in 1920. The commission published a reader for middle schools in 1920. However, since there no official grammar or dictionary were published in the new language standard, it did not succeed. Moreover, most of the works and translations created during the Albanian National Awakening (1870‚Äì1912) and the early 20th century were written in Tosk dialect. Afterwards The efforts for language standardisation would continue after World War II. A conference was held in Pristina in 1968, the Linguistic Conference of Pristina (), where the literary standard used so far in Albania and based on the Tosk dialect was adopted by ethnic Albanians of Yugoslavia at the expense of the Gheg dialect. The Tosk-based current standard would be established by the Albanian Orthography Congress of 1972.

The systems are designed to protect the exclusivity of a given creator and the rights to reproduce their work. YouTube uses automated measures such as copyright strikes, Content ID and Copyright Verification Program. However, these methods have been criticized for favoring corporations and the manifestation of a copyright claim industry that seeks financial gain through exploitation of the monetization of uploaded content. When a person creates an original work that is fixed in a physical medium, he or she automatically owns copyright to the work. The owner has the exclusive right to use the work in certain, specific ways. In response to a lawsuit from Viacom, video sharing service YouTube developed a copyright enforcement tool referred to as Content ID which automatically scans uploaded content against a database of copyrighted material ingested by third-parties. If an uploaded video is matched against an asset in the database, YouTube warns the user of the match and applies a predetermined 'match policy'. Issues =Beginnings= At the end of 2013, YouTube enabled automated Content ID claiming on videos uploaded by users who were signed with multi-channel networks (MCN). Previously, videos uploaded to channels that were linked to MCNs could only be claimed manually or removed with a DMCA takedown. This led to a large amount of new claims which suddenly left uploaders unable to place advertisements on their videos until they disputed. Users such as Angry Joe created videos complaining about the changes and how they would negatively affect the livelihoods of video creators. The sudden increase in claims especially affected channels which uploaded content featuring video games (such as Let's Plays) and movies (such as reviews). =Attempts at copyright enforcement= In 2015 YouTubers known as the Fine Brothers, who produce \\"reaction videos\\", applied to trademark the word \\"react\\" when it was used in an uploaded video title to protect their series such as \\"Kids React\\" or \\"Adults React\\". An action that received severe criticism from other Youtubers because it would mean - that if successful - that similar named videos could be removed according to Youtube's copyright system. In 2016, the Fine Brothers launched React World. This was a program where people could use Fine Brothers' icons to make their own videos for free. However, all uploaded \\"React\\" content had to be monetized on YouTube and some of the uploader's revenue would be paid to the Fine Brothers. After a massive backlash against what Fine Brothers were doing, they cancelled the program and rescinded their copyright and trademarks and application. It's been estimated their actions lost them more than 400,000 subscribers. =Rapid growth in copyright claiming= Since implementing its new policies, YouTube has acted swiftly to remove videos and even entire channels from its site when it receives claims of copyright infringement. However, despite its best intentions to protect creators and their works, a large number of claims are now made where no fair use laws have been broken. In November 2015, this issue was highly publicized when a review of the film Cool Cat Saves the Kids by the channel \\"I Hate Everything\\" was removed by YouTube, along with videos on Channel Awesome and Markiplier. This led to a large number of complaints against YouTube and on social media sites like Twitter. This prompted YouTube's CEO Susan Wojcicki to respond three months later with \\"Thank you @YouTube community for all the feedback. We're listening\\" in February 2016. Nevertheless, videos continued to be removed and flagged on the site when copyright claims were made against uploaders for using alleged use of protected material. On April 25, 2016, YouTuber and freelance video game critic Jim Sterling included clips of footage from Metal Gear Solid V, Grand Theft Auto V and Beyond: Two Souls, as well as the song \\"Chains of Love\\", in a video largely discussing Star Fox Zero. Sterling explained this at the end of the video as a way of preventing Nintendo from claiming and monetizing the video by including other material which was similarly flagged by Content ID, hoping that multiple claims would prevent anyone from monetizing the video and running advertisements on his channel, which is intended to be ad-free and funded solely by Patreon. In a follow-up video, he claimed that the technique, which he termed the \\"copyright deadlock\\", had succeeded, as the video received multiple ContentID claims, one of which attempted to monetize the video, while two others prevented any monetization, allowing the video to run advertisement-free. Sterling stated that this was indicative of a poorly designed system on YouTube's part, as a video which was well within the bounds of fair use had attracted three copyright claims. He also claimed that he would continue to include material which had previously received Content ID claims in videos likely to attract monetization attempts from the copyright owners, since fair use was not protecting his videos from copyright claims, pointing out that he now felt incentivized to use as much copyrighted material in his videos as possible, the opposite of what YouTube's copyright policies were intended to achieve. In May 2016, a YouTube user Matt Hosseinzadeh sued the YouTube channel h3h3productions (run by Ethan and Hila Klein) citing a video that criticized his content. Fellow YouTube user Philip DeFranco started a GoFundMe fundraiser entitled \\"Help for H3H3\\". The initiative raised over $130,000. The Kleins later uploaded a video where they announced that any funds from the fundraiser left over from their lawsuit would be entrusted in to a 'Fair Use Protection Account', which other users could request assistance from in the event they were sued for copyright infringement. On December 13, 2018, TheFatRat posted on Twitter that one of his songs, \\"The Calling\\", was content claimed by a user named Ramjets for unfairly using a song on the behalf of Andres Galvis, who had remixed the original track. He originally appealed, but was denied as it is not YouTube, but the user claiming the content who has the final say over the appeal. He messaged YouTube to appeal, but YouTube said that they do not mediate copyright claims.. On Jan 30, 2019, ObbyRaidz, a channel with 6000 subscribers, tweeted that someone called VengefulFlame had messaged him saying that they had put two copyright strikes on his channel (he did not infringe on any content) telling him to pay $150 to get the strikes removed, or else his channel would receive a third strike and be taken down. When he tweeted it, VengefulFlame messaged him: \\"Hey, we saw you tweet about us, Not sure why you thought that was a good idea or if you thought you would remotely get any help, but this has violated any potential deal. Enjoy your third copyright strike.\\" Kenzo, a channel with 60000 subscribers, said the VengefulFlame also messaged him to tell him to pay $600 or $400 worth of bitcoin and said they were paid by someone else to strike him. YouTube however, stepped in and resolved the strike and terminated the channel. On June 2019, Indonesian singer Denny Caknan with his song \\"Kartonyono Medot Janji\\" claimed by music labels stating that the content is purely made in the studio. On the contrary, in the interview with Anji which is also an Indonesian singer with 3.45 million subscribers on his private account, Denny stated that he is not registering his music with any labels. \\"The false claim has been removed, but after just one month, a copyright claim strike again on my song video.\\" This is largely because the policy in which YouTube can easily agree that a company own the video while it is not.[19] In January 2020, Jukin Media has been criticized for extorting YouTubers (MxR and Potastic Panda) that they don't pay $6,000 for copyright infringement. In this case, one of the pair's reaction videos saw them watch four clips recently bought by Jukin Media, which has promptly issued them with an invoice for four cases of infringing on its copyright. Jukin Media scouts for online videos going viral and licenses them. Liang expressed concern in a video posted on January 13, 2020 that the pair were being \\"extorted\\" and could lose their channel if Jukin Media contacted Google with all four claims at once, as this could potentially break YouTube's \\"three strikes\\" rule. He added that the pair had previously paid Jukin Media when it demanded cash for copyrighted material.

It remained on the Karelian Isthmus and had a relatively uneventful war facing the Finns until the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive began on June 10, 1944, from which point it saw much more active service. Following the end of the Continuation War, the division was transferred to 2nd Shock Army in 2nd Belorussian Front. Its soldiers distinguished themselves in the capture of the German city of Graudenz and ended the war fighting through Pomerania.  Formation  The division began forming in August, 1939, north of Leningrad, where it would spend most of the war. On Nov. 30 the Winter War with Finland began, and the division performed creditably enough that it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed Before June 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. VIII, 1996, p 71 On June 22, 1941, the division was in 19th Rifle Corps of 23rd Army near the Finnish border in Leningrad Military District. Its order of battle was as follows: * 461st Rifle Regiment * 588th Rifle Regiment * 701st Rifle Regiment * 334th Light Artillery Regiment * 234th Antitank Battalion * 227th Sapper Battalion * 196th Signal Battalion * 172nd Reconnaissance CompanySharp, p 71 P.S. Pshennikov, who had commanded the division in the Winter War, had been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General and was now in command of 23rd Army.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad, 1941-1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, p 20 On July 31 the Finnish Army began its offensive against 23rd Army and over the following month pushed south down the Karelian Isthmus as the Russian forces conducted a fighting retreat. On Aug. 31 the front had reached general line of the 1939 Finnish- Soviet border, and the Finns halted. The 142nd would remain along this line, fighting a static war, until June, 1944.  Karelian Offensive  The German forces to the south of Leningrad were driven away in January, 1944. In early June, the Soviet 23rd and 21st Armies were reinforced for a reckoning with Finland. The 142nd, now in 115th Rifle Corps and under command of Col. G.L. Sonnikov, was on the extreme right flank and in first echelon of 23rd Army on the shores of Lake Ladoga.Glantz, p 418 The offensive began on June 10. After initial attacks, the division advanced 9km on June 14 against the Finnish 19th Infantry Brigade, piercing the first Finnish defensive belt. The offensive slowed as Finnish resistance grew, and it wasn't until early July that the army forced its way to the Vuoksi River and cleared the south bank. An assault crossing was made by the 461st Rifle Regiment on July 9 which gained a foothold on the north bank, allowing the rest of the division to cross, and a bridgehead 7km wide and 2km deep was established. The Finnish III Army responded with reinforcements, trying to crush the bridgehead. In the end they were only able to contain it. After three days of fighting, 23rd Army went over to the defense.Glantz, pp 453-54 The Moscow Armistice brought the fighting to a halt, leaving the 142nd available for the assault on Germany.  Advance Into Germany  After spending October rebuilding in Stavka reserves, the 142nd was transferred to the 98th Rifle Corps, where it would remain for the duration. That corps was, in turn, transferred to 2nd Shock Army, which was placed under command of Marshal K.K. Rokossovsky in 2nd Belorussian Front.Dr. Boris Sokolov, Marshal K.K. Rokossovsky, trans. and ed. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, p 375 The division would remain under these commands for the duration as well. The 142nd took part in the Vistula- Oder Offensive, advancing on the right flank of its Front. During this overall offensive it also participated in the East Pomeranian Offensive, and distinguished itself in the capture of the city of Graudenz on Mar. 6, 1945. Seven officers and men were named as Heroes of the Soviet Union for this victory, and the division received the city's name as an honorific. The division finished the war along the Baltic coast in west Pomerania, with the official designation: 142nd Rifle, Graudenz, Order of the Red Banner Division.

She made her first on-screen appearance on 11 August 2008 and was introduced by series producer, Anita Turner. The character departed on 5 August 2011. Shahidi returned to Emmerdale for two episodes on 25 December 2013. She returned full-time in January 2014. On 5 January 2018, Shahadi took maternity leave from the show whilst pregnant with her first child. She returned on 3 October 2018. Casting In July 2008, the Prestwich Advertiser reported that actress Roxy Shahidi had joined the cast of Emmerdale as Leyla Harding. Shahidi signed an initial six-month contract. She said of her casting: \\"I‚Äôve been filming for two weeks now and it‚Äôs great. [...] I‚Äôve done a lot of theatre but not much TV work up to now so it‚Äôs great for me to work on such a popular and well established show. It‚Äôs a dream come true in fact.\\" Shahidi later said that she was \\"so excited\\", commenting: \\"This is a brilliant opportunity for me as I've done lots of theatre but not much TV. Everyone at Emmerdale has been so warm and welcoming. It's such a well- established show and I can't wait to see what Leyla gets up to.\\" Emmerdale series producer Anita Turner added, \\"Rokhsaneh is a terrific actress and an exciting new addition to the cast. Leyla's going to have some fun stirring up the factory.\\" Character development =Characterisation= Leyla is described as \\"streetwise\\" and \\"savvy\\". Shahidi described her as \\"very down to earth\\", \\"very lovable\\" and \\"really ballsy\\". Leyla was initially a new worker at Eric Pollard's (Chris Chittell) factory and it was said that she would immediately get on the right side of him. Leyla is reluctant to talk about her past, which sparks speculation about why she has moved to the village. Channel Five's soap opera reporting website Holy Soap describe Leyla as a \\"naive, honest, hard worker who can sometimes be a bit too trusting of people\\". What's on TV deemed her an \\"attractive woman\\". Shahidi told the Daily Mirror that she and Leyla are \\"quite similar in some ways\\" saying \\"We're both pretty ditsy and we have the same sense of fun. Leyla says things without thinking, and I can do that too.\\" She added that their lives and relationships are very different because she and Leyla are \\"worlds apart\\". =Relationship with David Metcalfe= Leyla begins a relationship with Eric's son, David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden). In October 2009, Leyla sleeps with her new boss, Nathan Wylde (Lyndon Ogbourne). However, when she admits that she regrets cheating on David, Nathan warns that he will not let her forget what happened and begins a \\"campaign of manipulation\\". Of the plot, Ogbourne told the Press Association: \\"The switch between being such a seemingly nice guy and the malicious way he's controlling Leyla is quite horrific.\\" He added that Nathan would get \\"worse and worse\\" and could \\"easily fit into the cast of American Psycho by the end of it\\". Leyla then fears that Nathan will tell David the truth. Shahidi said this causes Leyla to be \\"under a lot of stress\\". However, Leyla confesses to David. Leyla and David later reconcile. Wolfenden said he believes that Leyla is the \\"right woman\\" for David, despite \\"all of the things she has done to him\\". He said \\"David seems to be under the thumb, and Leyla gets away with cheating, stealing and having a secret son. But David has been good enough to put that to one side, so because of that I reckon she must be the right girl for him.\\" =Family= In May 2010, Digital Spy reported that Leyla's sister, Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson), would be introduced. The website said Alicia arrives in the village and makes it clear that she has unfinished business with Leyla. Leyla and Alicia's relationship is \\"far from perfect\\". Leyla is forced to deal with Alicia's arrival in an attempt to keep her \\"murky and scandal-ridden\\" past buried. Anderson said that Alicia was set to make life quite complicated for Leyla. Emmerdale series producer Gavin Blyth added that Alicia will start stirring things up in Leyla's life the minute she sets foot in the village. Alicia arrives in the village to warn Leyla that she does not want her at their mother's funeral. However, Leyla ignores Alicia and they \\"have a bit of a screaming match\\" at the funeral, which leaves Alicia annoyed. Discussing what caused the \\"bad blood\\" between Alicia and Leyla in an interview with Digital Spy, Anderson said, \\"All I can really say is that something has definitely gone on between them! [...] The biggest clue I can give is that Alicia is fiercely protective of her family unit and she doesn't want anything to come between that. So you can read into that what you want!\\" Anderson said that Alicia does not want to cause trouble, but does not want Leyla around. Anderson added that Alicia would \\"prefer it if [Leyla] just disappeared\\". Alicia was introduced along with her husband, Justin (Andrew Langtree), and their son, Jacob (Joe Warren-Plant). In September 2010, it was revealed that Leyla was the biological mother of Jacob. Shahidi said that she was \\"really shocked\\" when she learned about the storyline, but was also excited as she thought it would be \\"really interesting\\" to play. She opined that the storyline would bring a new dimension to Leyla. Shahidi was involved in Warren-Plant's casting as Jacob. Shahidi admitted that she was surprised that Leyla had not seen Jacob for so long, but understood as Leyla wanted to get on with her life and escape her past. Shahidi said that Leyla just wants to be Jacob's aunt. Leyla wants to see Jacob and interact with him like a normal aunt and nephew. Shahidi had previously said that Leyla kept the secret as she wanted to get on with her life. Shahidi also said that the easiest way for Leyla to move on in her life was to ignore it. Leyla takes Jacob to a birthday party, where he goes into anaphylactic shock due to an allergic reaction to some cake. Speaking about the plot, Shahidi commented: \\"It's Leyla's fault because she hasn't listened to her sister's warnings about not letting Jacob eat anything because of his nut allergy.\\" Shahidi added that if Leyla had listened to Alicia, it could have been avoided. The situation shocks Leyla and makes her realise that Alicia is Jacob's mother and needs to be listened to. Shahidi said that Leyla needs to learn to be \\"less full-on\\" and stop \\"indulging and spoiling\\" Jacob. =Departure (2011)= In June 2011, the Daily Star Sunday reported that Shahidi was to leave Emmerdale. Speaking to the newspaper, Shahidi confirmed: \\"I have had an amazing three years at Emmerdale and it has been a really tough decision to leave.\\" She filmed her final scenes as Leyla later that month. Shahidi admitted to We Love Telly that it took her six months to reach the decision to leave the show. The actress explained that Anderson helped her reach the decision as she has experience of leaving a long-running serial. Shahidi said that viewers would see a \\"desperate\\" side to Leyla in the build-up to her departure. =Reintroduction (2013)= Leyla returned to Emmerdale during the episode broadcast on 25 December 2013. Shahidi revealed that when she received the call from producer Kate Oates about coming back, it came at the \\"perfect time.\\" She was initially in talks about coming back earlier, but the play she was appearing extended its run. She continued, \\"I went away from that not knowing whether Leyla was coming back, but then when Kate got in touch with this Christmas Day storyline, it just felt like fate because it was a much better way for Leyla to come back into the show.\\" Shahidi said that she had always hoped Leyla would return at some point and she was excited about Leyla's return storyline. The show's producers decided not to announce Shahidi's return, so viewers would be surprised. When asked how long she would be staying with the show, she quipped that Leyla would have \\"lots of exciting stuff\\" in 2014 and she and Anderson had spent time filming on location. The actress added \\"After that, there's stuff in the pipeline but I haven't read the scripts yet!\\" Alicia later finds Leyla working as a pole dancer. To prepare for the storyline, Shahidi took pole dancing lessons and had to wear a PVC catsuit. Shahidi explained that it was important for viewers to warm to Leyla and she did not want to be wearing \\"a little pair of panties\\", as it may have been off putting to some. She thought the catsuit was the perfect outfit for Leyla as it made her look ridiculous. She told Susan Hill from the Daily Star that she enjoyed the fact Leyla did not come back to the village straight away following her appearance at Christmas, saying \\"It means the viewers can see what she's been doing while she's been away.\\" Hill reported that there would be \\"lots of twists and turns\\" as Leyla continues to work on her relationships with her sister and son. Shahidi added that she was looking forward to the next chapter in Leyla's life. Storylines =2008‚Äì2011= Leyla visits Emmerdale for a job interview with Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell). She tells him that she won Machinist of the Year in 2007 and left her last job because of \\"inappropriate overtime\\" with a young manager. Eric gives her the job and Leyla soon makes friends with her colleagues and joins the St. Mary's Church Choir, formed to enter a competition and save the church from closure. Months later, colleague Lily Butterfield (Anne Charleston) sees Leyla leaving the building late at night and arriving very early. Eventually, Leyla reveals she is sleeping there and that she was at university. Unfortunately her part-time jobs as a cleaner and barmaid meant things got on top of her and she left. Lily asked Leyla to move in with her and Edna Birch (Shirley Stelfox), Lily's sister, who was unhappy with the arrangement so Lily and Leyla joined Pearl Ladderbanks (Meg Johnson). When Pearl or Lily ask Leyla about her family, she is evasive. Leyla is interested in David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden), inviting him to a concert but he was sidetracked by Nicola De Souza (Nicola Wheeler), who was upset, thinking her father was terminally ill. On learning Rodney was healthy, David tells Leyla he can go, after all. In early February, they go out for the night and meets Skin, who drives them back to Emmerdale. When Skin tries getting close to Leyla, she makes him sleep in his van. The next day, Pearl sees him leaving with their valuables. David, by chance, knocks him down and Leyla kisses him as a thank you. They have a brief relationship but he dumps her when she believes he has feelings for Nicola. In April, they reconcile and Leyla tells David that her mother is in a care home, so she needs to earn more to fund it. They grow closer when campaigning for his election to the local council and he wins on 4 June. Leyla starts work as deputy manager of the farm shop opened by Natasha Wylde (Amanda Donohoe) in the village. On seeing Maisie's new shoes, Leyla was jealous and stole ¬£250 from the shop for a pair, planning to put it back when she got paid. However, Natasha's son Nathan (Lyndon Ogbourne) found out and surprised Leyla be being understanding. After going to a concert together, they got drunk and had a one-night stand. Attempting to quit her job, Nathan turned nasty and blackmailed her, but made David suspicious. In November, she admits to her one-night stand with Nathan and, disgusted, he left. When he saw Nathan attacking Leyla, he punched him and later forgave her, reuniting in December. Leyla bought the farm shop and renamed it \\"Leyla's\\". Now officially together, they bought Farrers Barn. Leyla got the news that her mum had died and insisted on attending the funeral alone. She comforted her sister Alicia Gallagher (Natalie Anderson), during the service but Alicia insisted Leyla leave, saying that she couldn't be trusted. Leyla later visited her sister's house and watched her with her husband, Justin, and young son, Jacob (Joe-Warren Plant). She met Justin several times in secret, making David thinking she was having an affair. She swore she wasn't but wouldn't explain so David left for a council trip, thinking Leyla was lying. While away, Alicia and Jacob visited and Leyla's difficult relationship with her mother and sister was explained. Jacob is, in fact, Leyla's son. When she was 18, she got pregnant accidentally and her mum and Alicia encouraged her to let Alicia and her husband adopt the baby, despite Leyla not wanting to give Jacob away after he was born. After much persuasion, Leyla gave Jacob to Alicia as she couldn‚Äôt have children and she felt like she owed her. It was later revealed that Alicia's husband is, in fact Jacob's biological father, after a drunken one night stand with Leyla. When Alicia revealed that she and Justin had split up, Leyla insisted they stay with her and David. David was unhappy but accepted it to make Leyla happy. Alicia soon got a job as barmaid at The Woolpack but annoyed David by assuming that Leyla would babysit. Eventually David got so fed up of the complications that having Jacob around caused, he demanded Leyla choose: him or Jacob. She promptly left but later sent Jacob a present. After Alicia and David tell Jacob that Leyla is his birth mother, Jacob begins emailing Leyla. =2013‚Äì= Leyla returns, demanding to speak to Alicia and Jacob. She meets David and tells him that Jacob has been emailing her, as he knows she is his biological mother. Leyla then learns that David is marrying Alicia. Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick) lock Leyla in a cupboard, to stop her ruining the wedding. She is later let out and sees Alicia, who promptly slaps her. Alicia sees that Jacob is confused and upset, following Leyla's visit, and agrees to let her be part of Jacob's life. After dropping Leyla at her flat, Alicia sees her leave and follows her to a strip club. She learns that Leyla is now a pole dancer and angrily drags her offstage before being arrested on suspicion of soliciting. They are released the next day and Leyla returns to Emmerdale with Alicia, much to David's annoyance. Leyla makes friends with Priya Sharma (Fiona Wade) who helps her get a job at the factory. She moves in with Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward). Leyla tries to help Priya through her pregnancy, as she has an eating disorder. She is surprised to learn that David is the baby's father but more concerned that Priya is putting the baby at risk. She denies that she has an eating problem but finally confides in her and Leyla accompanies Priya to a scan, where they are told the baby is smaller than average, but unharmed. However, Priya is worried but repeatedly tells Leyla not to tell anyone, adamant that she can cope alone. However, Leyla tells Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson), and he forces her to eat a biscuit, making her angry. She is also angry with Leyla for telling him but Leyla also tells Alicia. Alicia receives a ¬£70,000 inheritance from the recently deceased Keith Cheesedale. Alicia accepts the money and learns that Mr. Cheesedale was Leyla's boss/lover. The money was mistakenly given to Alicia as Leyla's stage name was \\"Alicia Harding\\". Alicia and David refuse to give Leyla the money until Jacob throws it in the river. David and Leyla recover most of it and she repays Jacob the money he lent her and gives Alicia and David enough for a new car. A delighted Leyla then enjoys her windfall. Leyla later becomes business partners with Megan Macey (Gaynor Faye) and they decide to base their new- found business around wedding planning. They plan Laurel Thomas' (Charlotte Bellamy) and Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock) wedding and Priya's wedding to Rakesh Kotecha (Pasha Bocarie). When flirting with Megan's boyfriend, Jai, Leyla realises that she has a crush on him, touches him and they end up copulating. Leyla tries to end her affair with Jai repeatedly but keeps falling for his charms and they are caught by Rakesh. Leyla swears Rakesh to secrecy but her friends become suspicious, knowing that she is in a secret relationship. Jai and Leyla are nearly caught by Megan but Leyla manages to hide. After Jai is rushed to hospital following an accident at home, Megan discovers Jai and Leyla's affair. She tries to convince Leyla to sell her half of the business to her, but Leyla refuses. She does, however, agree to stay away from Jai and Megan reconciles with him. Leyla supports Alicia when she is sexually assaulted by Lachlan White (Thomas Atkinson), and helps Alicia, David and Jacob through their difficult time. She slaps Georgia Sharma (Trudie Goodwin), for snide remarks about Alicia dress sense, saying that is what made Lachlan attack her. Alicia changes her style and appearance, upsetting Leyla as she tries to convince her sister not to change because of what Lachlan did. She is pleased for Alicia and David when they decide to move to Portugal but argues with Alicia on realising that she will not be able to spend time with Jacob. Leyla rekindles her affair with Jai, who is still with Megan, and he promises that he will marry Leyla after leaving Megan, which excites her. However, her feelings are challenged when she sees him violently grab Rachel Breckle's (Gemma Oaten) and threaten to murder her if she does not give him custody of their son, Archie. Leyla tells the court about Jai's behaviour, which causes Jai to lose his case for residency. The affair ends when she thinks that Megan has miscarried Jai's baby. Alicia returns to the village when Val is killed in a helicopter crash and is shocked by David's plans to stay and buy the shop back. When Alicia and David announce their separation, Leyla tries to make David see what he is throwing away and books him a ticket to Portugal but he refuses to go, frustrating Leyla. She says a tearful farewell to Alicia and Jacob and insists David made the wrong decision. Leyla tells him that Alicia is filing for divorce and is annoyed that he does not care. Leyla begins dating Pete Barton (Anthony Quinlan) and they become engaged. However, they end the relationship after deciding, on their wedding day, that they are rushing things. She later discovers from Pete's mother, Emma Barton (Gillian Kearney), that Pete had been having an affair with Leyla's best friend, Priya. She attacks Priya in the salon after finding out and declares they are no longer friends. Following the death of Pete's mother, Emma, and younger brother, Finn Barton (Joe Gill), Leyla supports Pete as a friend, however is shocked to learn that Pete could potentially be the father of his aunt, Moira Dingle's (Natalie J. Robb) baby after having sex with her while engaged to Leyla. After learning that Emma was murdered, Leyla also informs the police that Priya had threatened Emma. Reception A reporter from Holy Soap named Leyla's most \\"memorable moment\\" as being when she thought Rodney was attempting to seduce her.

Written by Barbara Kymlicka, the film is about a young woman struggling to get serious about her life who finds a letter to Santa from a seven-year-old girl asking for a new wife for her widowed father and decides to bring happiness to their lives. The film first aired on the Lifetime television network on November 26, 2011.  Plot  Crystal Carruthers (Amy Acker) is a frivolous thirty-year-old woman drifting through life shopping with her wealthy parents' money. In an effort to get their daughter to get serious about her life, they inform her that she has until Christmas to change her life style or else they will cancel her credit cards. One day Crystal discovers a letter to Santa Claus from a seven- year-old girl, Olivia (Emma Duke), asking him to send her widowed father a new wife for Christmas. Inspired by the young girl's hopeful letter, she decides to seek them out in the hopes of making herself their gift from Santa. Olivia's father, Derek Gowen (David Haydn-Jones), owns a snow plowing business and runs a local soup kitchen for the homeless. When Crystal tracks him down, she volunteers her time at the soup kitchen so she can get closer to him. At first, she is completely out of her element at the soup kitchen; but gradually she begins to care about the homeless. She and Derek become close, especially after she teaches Olivia some ice skating moves at the local ice rink. Unfortunately, Derek's girlfriend Jillian (Gina Holden) seems to get in the way. Crystal remains determined to make something of herself, despite the obstacles that stand in her way, and she begins to throw herself into her work at the soup kitchen. Meanwhile, Derek works overtime trying to earn extra money to pay the soup kitchen bills after receiving a Notice of Eviction. One evening, Crystal volunteers to watch Olivia while Derek goes out on an emergency snow plowing job. Lacking any cooking skills, Crystal first burn their canned dinner, then orders pizza for them and listens while Olivia opens up about her memories of her mother. By the time Derek returns home, Crystal and Olivia are fast asleep. He invites Crystal to stay the night. Gradually, Olivia improves her ice skating skills, and Derek becomes attracted to Crystal. Jillian reveals that Crystal lied about graduating college. Crystal learns that Derek will be forced to close the soup kitchen before Christmas because he owes the bank $10,000. At a party at Derek's house, Crystal leaves her handbag in the bathroom, where it's discovered by Jillian who finds Olivia's letter to Santa. When she shows Derek the letter, he confronts Crystal and calls her a liar. In the interim, Crystal has received a $10,000 check from her parent's, their final payment to support her. She decides to use it to pay the bank to keep the soup kitchen open. Soon after, Derek arrives at the soup kitchen prepared to close it down when he learns that someone paid the back rent. He goes home a discovers that Olivia is missing. Meanwhile, Crystal goes to the town Christmas tree and finds Olivia by the tree. Just as she tells the girl that she found her letter to Santa, Derek arrives, apologizes to her, and the three embrace each other.

Critical response  Dear Santa received mixed reviews from critics. CJ from Therefore I Blog gave the film 3.75 out of five stars, calling it \\"pretty average, but pleasant fare\\". Radio Times gave it two out of five stars. In his review for Just Press Play, Rob Perez called the film \\"part family entertainment, part romance, and part holiday fantasy\\". According to Perez, while the film presents \\"good old fashion family values\\" and attempts to \\"tug at our heart strings\\", in the end it lacks substance and originality.

As displayed on the web pages of the English- language version of Wikipedia, there is a wordmark \\"WA\\" under the globe, and below that the text \\"The Free Encyclopedia\\" in the free open-source Linux Libertine font. Puzzle-globe design A partial globe hangs in the Wikimedia Foundation office. Each piece bears a glyph (a letter or other character), or glyphs, symbolizing the multilingualism of Wikipedia. As with the Latin letter \\"W\\", these glyphs are in most cases the first glyph or glyphs of the name \\"Wikipedia\\" rendered in that language. They are as follows: *At left, from the top down, are Armenian v, Cambodian vƒï (lying on its side), Bengali U, Devanagari ‡§µ‡§ø vi, and Georgian v. *In the middle-left column is Greek ≈ç, and below that are Chinese w√©i,see Á∂≠Âü∫Â§ßÂÖ∏ Kannada vi, and (barely visible at the bottom) Tibetan wi. *In the middle-right column is Latin . Above that is Japanese wi; below it are Cyrillic i, Hebrew v, and (barely visible at the bottom) Tamil vi. *The rightmost column is Ethiopic w…ô, Arabic w, Korean wi, and Thai wi. The top edge line of the ‡™µ‡™ø puzzle piece on the rear side of the ball (as seen the 2D character map) crosses through the inwards indentation of the „Ç¶„Ç£ puzzle piece when viewed from the default front perspective. The empty space at the top represents the incomplete nature of the project, the articles and languages yet to be added. History Wikipedia's logo used from 2003 until 2010 Logo creator Paul Stansifer at the Wikimedia Foundation in front of the Wikipedia Puzzle Globe Logo sculpture in May 2012 The design of \\"WA\\" text beneath a globe, with the interlocking-V W and large A, was designed by Wikipedia user The Cunctator for a November 2001 logo contest. An initial design of the puzzle-globe logo was created by Paul Stansifer, a then 17-year- old Wikipedia user, whose entry won a design competition run by the site in 2003. Another Wikipedia user, David Friedland, subsequently improved the logo by changing the styling of the jigsaw pieces so that their boundaries seemed indented and simplified their contents to be a single glyph per piece, rather than a jumble of nonsense multilingual text. In the process, some errors were introduced. In particular, one piece of Devanagari script, and one piece of Japanese katakana were incorrectly rendered.\\"This Logo Is a Work in Progress.\\" The New York Times. June 24, 2007. Retrieved on July 11, 2011. Also, the Chinese character (Ë¢ì) has no immediate connection with Wikipedia. Current logo Glyphs contained in the new logotype A \\"Wikiball\\" In 2007, a modified 3D model was developed by Wikimedia Taiwan for Wikimania, when they distributed a 3-inch diameter spherical puzzle based on the logo, that attendees could piece together. It did not add other glyphs on the parts that cannot be seen on the 2D logo, but used that space to include small logos of the sister projects and information about Wikimania. A variant of that model was used to build a person-sized Wikiball that spun on a stand, featured during the event.It was torn down after the event. See this Category of Commons images for a sense of its size. This led to a renewed interest in getting a proper 3D model for the logo. The 3D Wikipedia puzzle from Wikimania 2007 By 2007, users on listservs discovered that the logo had some minor errors. The errors were not immediately fixed, because, according to Friedland, he could not locate the original project file. Friedland added that \\"I have tried to reconstruct it, but it never looks right\\" and that the logo \\"should be redrawn by a professional illustrator.\\" , a Wikipedian, said that most Japanese users supported correcting the errors. In an e-mail to Noam Cohen of The New York Times, Kizu said that \\"It could be an option to leave them as they are. Most people don't take it serious and think the graphical logo is a sort of pot-au-feu of various letters without meaning.\\" In late 2009, the Wikimedia Foundation undertook to fix the errors and generally update the puzzle globe logo. Among other concerns, the original logo did not scale well and some letters appeared distorted.\\"brand new\\" about new logo For the new logo, the Wikimedia Foundation defined which characters appear on the \\"hidden\\" puzzle pieces, and had a three-dimensional computer model of the globe created to allow the generation of other views.Wikimedia blog ‚Äì Wikipedia in 3d A partial 3D globe was commissioned for the Wikimedia office.The work was done by the Because We Can studio, based on the new digital 3D model. The logo was rolled out on the projects in May 2010. It features the new 3D rendering of the puzzle globe, with corrected characters (and the Klingon character replaced by a Ge'ez character). The wordmark has been modified from the Hoefler Text font to the open-source Linux Libertine font, and the subtitle is no longer italicized. The \\"W\\" character, which was used in various other places in Wikipedia (such as the favicon) and was a \\"distinctive part of the Wikipedia brand\\", was stylized as crossed V's in the original logo, , while the W in Linux Libertine is rendered with a single line. To provide the traditional appearance of the Wikipedia \\"W\\", a \\"crossed\\" W was added as an OpenType variant to the Linux Libertine font. On October 24, 2014, the Wikimedia Foundation released the logo, along with all other logos belonging to the Foundation, under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license. On September 29, 2017, the logo of Wikipedia was submerged to the bottom of Armenia‚Äôs Lake Sevan thanks to the joint efforts of Wikimedia Armenia and ArmDiving divers‚Äô club. The logo is an unfinished globe made of puzzle pieces with symbols (including Armenian \\"v\\" letter) from different sign systems written on them. The 2m wide, 2m high logo (the largest in the world) was made in Armenia for the annual meeting of the Central and Eastern Europe Wikimedia affiliates, Wikimedia CEE Meeting that the country hosted in August 2016 in Dilijan.

Zhang was also well liked by Chiang for his personal loyalty - Zhang was conservative with respect to Chinese cultural traditions of filial piety, which was recognized by other Neo-Confucians like Chiang. Second Sino- Japanese War & World War II Zheng made a name for himself as a capable commander, defeating forces of the technologically and logistically superior Imperial Japanese Army in several engagements in Yunnan, Burma, Northern China, and Manchuria. In Yunnan, Zhang was considered popular with his troops, and many of the soldiers recruited and trained there would remain with him throughout the remainder of his campaigns with the Kuomintang. It is during this time that Zheng came under the command of General Du Yuming, and himself gained a degree of notoriety inside China. Chinese Civil War From 1945‚Äì47 Zhang Dongguo served as a commander of Nationalist forces in Northeast China led by Lieutenant General Du Yuming participating in several significant victories against Communist forces there, including Du Yuming's defeat of the Communist general Lin Biao twice at Siping. After Chiang Kai-shek ordered Du Yuming's replacement by Chen Cheng, Zheng's and his troops were transferred under Chen's command. Chen was not as capable as Du, and Communist forces led by Lin Biao quickly took control of the region in 1948, surrounding Zheng's troops garrisoned inside the city of Changchun. Siege of Changchun As part of the much greater Liaoshen Campaign, Communist forces led by Lin Biao, in the areas surrounding Changchun, cut off roads, railways, and other routes of entry and egress to the Northeast, and cordoned off the city of Changchun itself. Though not surrounded by an ancient city wall, owing to the modernity of the city, the garrison had constructed, with the help of conscripted civilian labor a large moat, eight feet deep and twelve feet wide in 1947. The defenders, veterans of many campaigns against communist and Japanese forces, were considered crack-troops. Lin Biao deemed an assault on the city was deemed too costly and dangerous. Instead, communist forces decided to conduct a siege of the city, while preparing ambushes and traps for any Nationalist relief columns, using the city as bait. Chiang did not order Zheng to break out of Changchun, knowing that friendly lines were too far away. Chiang instead attempted to order other forces to relieve the city, but this was ineffective. Chiang also attempted to keep the city supplied by air-drops, but the Nationalist air force was unable to fulfill this role due to its small size and lack of experience. A small quantity of the supplies intended for the garrison actually landed inside communist lines, and the communist troops sometimes used these items for propaganda effect. After destroying or thwarting several Nationalist relief columns, communist troops made overtures to the defenders, enticing them to surrender, but these were unsuccessful. Mao Zedong decided that the city would fall once the defenders had been weakened sufficiently. Famine was used by the communists during the siege in order to force the defending nationalist troops to capitulate; estimates range as high as 330,000. Communist forces allowed Nationalist soldiers to leave, but prevented civilians from doing so, going so far as to force them back into the city at gun-point. Many civilians starved to death at the city limits in front of communist forces as a result. The siege would last for 150 days, and resulted in the deaths from starvation of approximately 80 percent of the civilian population. When the 60th Army and New 7th Army surrendered, only 40,000 survivors remained by the time Zhang gave the order. Later life Zheng was captured after being forced to surrender Changchun. He spent several years as a prisoner of war, but was eventually released and lived out his remaining years in the People's Republic of China. In his later years, Zheng stated in several interviews that he regretted holding out for so long in Changchun, believing that it only caused further suffering and death.

The car received global media attention, because the car was regarded as a copy of the Range Rover Evoque. As a result, Jaguar Land Rover had tried to prevent the Landwind X7 from entering the market. On March 22, 2019, after four years of sales, a Chinese court ruled that Landwind had copied five unique design elements and ordered a cease of production and sales immediately, in addition to paying Jaguar Land Rover compensation. Before the 2017 facelift, the car was sold with a 2.0 L Mitsubishi engine, that produces a maximum of 190 PS (140 kW; 187 hp) at 5,500 rpm. The maximum torque is 250 N¬∑m. After the 2017 update, the engine was replaced by a 1.5 L Ford GTDI engine with 250 N¬∑m that produces 162 PS (118 kW; 160 hp) between 5,400 and 5,700 rpm. The 1.5 L version has a top speed of , while the 2.0 L was listed as having a top speed of over .  Background  News of the Landwind X7 first emerged in April 2014, when Chinese car website Autohome showed pictures of the car under the name \\"Landwind E32\\". It claimed the pictures came from a patent filing by Landwind. The news report also contained specifications of the car. In May, the X7 was first spotted out in the open. The Landwind X7 was officially revealed in November 2014 at the Guangzhou Auto Show. Before it entered the market, the car was also shown at the 2015 edition of Auto Shanghai. Sales of the Landwind X7 in China started on August 6, 2015. It was offered in three trim levels. A facelifted model was first shown at the 2017 Guangzhou Auto Show in November. The exterior was altered, a new cheaper 1.5-litre engine was introduced, and the transmission was updated. British automobile magazine Autocar wrote the most significant external changes were the new front bumper and the adjusted back. The X7 is sold in five trim levels. Controversy A Range Rover Evoque, which the Landwind X7 was found to be copying the design of. The Landwind X7 received worldwide media attention because of the car's resemblance to the Range Rover Evoque. Although the designs of the cars are similar, the X7 was barely over one third of the price of the Evoque when the former hit the market. Prices of the X7 started at ¬•135,000 (US$ 21,700 as of August 2015), while the starting price of the Evoque amounted to ¬•398,000 (US$ 64,000 as of August 2015). After a new smaller engine was introduced in 2017, the X7's starting price dropped to just under ¬•100,000 (US$ 15,000 as of November 2017). Kits for the X7 are sold in China in order to make the car look more like the Evoque. Such kits include the grille, logos, and badges of the Evoque. The unveiling of the X7 came just after Land Rover's parent company Jaguar Land Rover opened a new factory in the Chinese city Changshu in October 2014. The factory produces the Evoque and Discovery Sport for the Chinese market. The Evoque was unveiled for the Chinese market in November 2014 at the Guangzhou Auto Show, where the X7 was also unveiled as well. Sales of the Evoque in China started in March 2015, five months before sales of the X7 began. = Jaguar Land Rover's reaction and legal action = Jaguar Land Rover's first response came during the Guangzhou Auto Show in November 2014, when car designer Ian Callum, who works for Jaguar, tweeted pictures of the car and pointed out the resemblance between the X7 and the Evoque. Furthermore, the company stated that it was investigating whether the Evoque's design elements were copied by Jiangling Motors, Landwind's parent company, and that it would \\"take whatever steps are appropriate to protect its intellectual property.\\" Jaguar Land Rover later went to court in China, but its complaints were dismissed in early 2015. At the 2015 edition of Auto Shanghai, Jaguar Land Rover's CEO Ralf Speth said he regretted \\"that all of a sudden, copy-paste is coming up again.\\" He added that his company could not do anything, since there were no laws against copying cars. Both Jaguar Land Rover and Jiangling Motors had filed design patents for the Evoque and the X7, respectively, but both patents were annulled in 2016. The patent for the exterior design of the Evoque in China was declared invalid in April by the Chinese intellectual property regulator, because the car was unveiled before the patent was filed in China in November 2011. The nullification happened at the request of Jiangling Motors. The X7's patent was annulled shortly thereafter at Jaguar Land Rover's request, because the design was too related to the Evoque's design. In June 2016, Jaguar Land Rover took legal action against Jiangling Motors again in a Beijing court. The car manufacturer blamed Jiangling for copyright infringement and unfair competition. It was a rare move; most non-Chinese car manufacturers choose not to go to court over design copying by Chinese companies because of the small likelihood of winning such lawsuit. In the same month, an unnamed source said to Reuters that Jiangling had agreed with Jaguar Land Rover it would not export the X7 to Brazil. According to that same source, both companies had also discussed what would be acceptable in a design update for the X7. On March 22, 2019, the Beijing Chaoyang District Court ruled in favor of Jaguar Land Rover, saying that Landwind had copied five unique design elements and ordered a cease of production and sales immediately, in addition to paying Jaguar Land Rover compensation.

They were led by guitarist and songwriter Ted Munda, and their style was highly influenced by the British Invasion and folk rock. They were considered the top group in Wilmington at the time and enjoyed several local hits, though they failed to reach a wider national audience due to poor management. The Enfields broke up in 1967, but Munda went on to form the group the Friends of the Family. Ted was also in the Blues Magoos, wrote for various Publishing companies in LA, was signed to Columbia Records in 1973 with group\\" Hotspur\\", and co-wrote \\"Blame It On Love\\" for Smokey Robinson in 1983‚Äì84 on Motown. He has several albums of unreleased produced material. In 1994 he created the Capstone Vortex Regeneration Healing Design. History The Enfields were formed in 1964 as merger between two Wilmington, Delaware bands called the Playboys and the Touchstones. \\\\- This source has Gordon Berl's name spelled as \\"Bell,\\" however other sources spell it as \\"Berl,\\" which is the likelihood. Ted Munda and Gordon Berl were members in the Playboys, and John Bernard, Bill Gallery, Robin Eaton, and Charles Jenner played in the Touchstones, a surf rock band. Once the two bands merged, their lineup and roles were as follows: Charlie Berl on vocals, Ted Munda, Vocals and Guitar and John Bernard on lead guitar, Bill Gallery on bass, and Gordon Berl on drums, often with Ted Munda and Charlie Berl on harmonies. Mac Morgan and Robin Eaton were never Members of the Enfield's. (Update Ted Munda 4/15/17)) They needed a name for the band and wanted to find something decidedly English, in keeping with the popular British invasion currently in vogue, so they chose the name the Enfields in honor of the famous British rifle named after the London Borough of Enfield. In 1966 they cut three singles released on the Richie label, beginning with their first \\"In the Eyes of the World,\\" which became a big local hit, and was followed up with an even bigger hit with the folk rock-influenced \\"She Already has Somebody\\" b/w \\"I'm For Things You Do,\\" both penned by Munda By this time, the Enfields had become the most popular group in Wilmington, however their local success failed to translate into wider national recognition. Their next single featured a ballad on the A-side, \\"You Don't Have Very Far,\\" b/w the harder and more compulsive \\"Face to Face.\\" In 1966, Bill Gallery left the band to go to college, and John Rhoads, from the Wrecking Crew, joined on bass. In early 1967 they released their last single \\"Twelve Month Coming\\" b/w the fiery rocker \\"Time Card,\\" but the single failed to chart. When Charlie Berl was drafted the group broke up. Following the group's breakup, guitarist Ted Munda formed the Friends of the Family with John Rhoads and two musicians, Wayne Watson and Jimmy Crawford, who had played in another local outfit the Turfs. The new band had a jazzier and more progressive approach. They went into Philadelphia's Virtue Recording Studios to record six demos, which came to the attention of Kama Sutra Records, but did not result in a contract. On July 24, 1968, the Friends of the Family shared the bill with The Who, The Troggs, and Pink Floyd at JFK Stadium, but due to inclement weather the show had to be halted. The line up changed and John Rhoads was replaced by Ray Andrews and Keyboards by Lindsay Lee. This is the lineup that played all the live shows and recorded 7 songs that are lost to history. In the intervening years since their demise, the Enfields' work has come to the attention of garage rock collectors and enthusiasts and has appeared on several compilations such as Classic Sounds of the 60s assembled by Get Hip Records. The Enfields' complete recordings have been anthologized on The Enfields/and early Friends of the Family, put out by Distortions Records.

Early life Edith Cash was born in Binghamton, New York, to John Ferris Cash and Adella Knapp Cash. She graduated from George Washington University in 1912 with an AB degree in history and languages and was the recipient of the Thomas F. Walsh undergraduate prize for academic excellence. She was knowledgeable about European literature, and according to the catalog from George Washington University, her major was in French with a minor in French and English. She studied as an assistant only one-night weekly during six months (October 1921 to May 1922) to obtain her formal mycology training, at the USDA Graduate School. She spent her entire research career in this institution. Cash started as a botanical translator in 1913. After 11 years, she advanced from that position to junior pathologist (1924). She obtained the position as assistant pathologist in 1929, after that as associate mycologist in 1944 and finally as mycologist in 1956. Career Cash is remembered by her mycologist and botanist colleagues as a scholar and mentor to young people in their careers. As a professional, she was known for her attention to detail and accuracy, which propelled her to positions as an editor of scientific journals. She was the editor of the mycology section of Biological Abstracts for many years, and the only person to complete three five-year periods as a member on the editorial board of Mycologia. Cash published 14 papers during her first decade as pathologist-mycologist, 11 of which were on Discomycetes, where she described 37 new species. The Discomycetes are a former taxonomic group inside of ascomycetes. Fungi that possess cup-shaped apothecia were known as Discomycetes. She also described many species from Sclerotinia, promoting interest in the study of this genus. During her research career, she described species of Discomycetes from many countries and other kinds of fungi. Her publications include the description of Discomycetes from California (Cash 1958), Hawaii (Cash 1938), Discomycetes and Hysteriales from Florida (Cash 1943), South America, India and fungi found on living orchids. Fungus specimens were collected at ports by inspectors of the Plant Quarantine Branch, Agricultural Research Services, United States of Agriculture, certain fungus species were reported for the first time on orchids (Cash and Watson 1955). She also published A Mycological English-Latin Glossary in 1965. In addition to her publications, Cash described 134 new species of fungi, all reported in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and identified over 11000 fungi specimens, including describing over 600 species of fungi and plants in Latin for her colleagues worldwide. Cash retired on May 31, 1958, but continued working on her own research and preparing descriptions in Latin for her colleagues around the world. In 1975, Cash and her sister moved to Binghamton, New York, where she started teaching community members to enjoy and recognize local flowering plants. She never married and was 101 years old when she died on April 6, 1992. Her remains are in the Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington D.C. close to those of her older sister Lillian Claire Cash, who was a microbiologist. Honors and awards Cash obtained the competitive US Government Superior Service Award in 1956 for the world-wide fungus index, which was used as the principal source for background information on fungus nomenclature and taxonomy. She was honored in the Gallery of Contemporary Noted Mycologists within three years of her retirement. Cash was a member of American Phytopathological Society, The American Association for the Advancement of Science, listed in American Men of Science in 1960, and a charter member of the Mycological Society of America. Fungal taxa named in her honor include the genus Cashiella, the fungus Lamprospora cashiae, and the lichen Lethariella cashmeriana.

In 2015, he was featured as one of the most influential people in the LGBT community by the magazine Out and he was named \\"Person of the Year\\" by Outsports. He grew up in Kentucky and became known after coming out after a basketball game. His coming out gained national attention after being featured in Outsports magazine. Maldonado wants to make sure no other teen endures the harassment he received after coming out in December 2014. Following reports that he had been harassed because of his sexuality by the rival team from Bryan Station High School, both schools were challenged in the press. Both schools said that they had conducted internal investigations and denied any wrongdoing. The Fayette County Public Schools administration's investigation concluded that the event \\"was inaccurately reported and mischaracterized\\" by media. After coming out, Maldonado's picture was left out of the two-page spread that commemorated his basketball team in his senior yearbook. In addition to the team photo, there were individual call-outs for every member of the team except Maldonado. His school, Betsy Layne High School, claimed that the omission was accidental and that the school district \\"holistically supports Dalton Maldonado just as we do all our students\\". They point out that the book includes 15 photos of Maldonado, including many that show him playing basketball. Maldonado has a fragrance released by Xyrena called Formula 3, sales of which will support the LGBT sports organization \\"You Can Play\\".

HomeSeer makes home automation controllers and software, designed to integrate lighting, HVAC, security, AV and other subsystems in most homes. Additionally, the company maintains an online store of compatible home automation products and a free online community forum for users and dealers.  History  =1999-2004= HS1 v1.7 distribution CD from 2004. HomeSeer was founded in 1999 by company president Richard Helmke. At the time, Helmke was employed as Software Project Leader for Cabletron (later becoming Enterasys) in Rochester, New Hampshire. Helmke developed an interest in home automation and set about to find a software program that would fit his needs. After trying several programs, Helmke elected to create his own program (initially named AutoHome), and launched that effort, as a part-time pursuit, under the company name \\"Keware\\". Shortly after release, Keware was renamed HomeSeer and AutoHome was renamed HomeSeer v1 or HS1 for short. At first, the software was compatible with X10 light switches, plug-in modules and controllers. Over time, support was added for additional products such as the ADI Ocelot, JDS Stargate controller and WGL W800 wireless receivers. An open API coupled with a freely available SDK was added to encourage 3rd party development of plug-in (drivers) for support of additional technologies and products. HS1 included support for remote internet access and voice control using Microsoft speech technology (SAPI). As sales of HS1 increased, a message board forum was implemented to provide community-based support for HS1 users. In 2002, Helmke left his position at Enterasys to focus solely on HomeSeer. In 2003, driver support was added to HS1 for Z-Wave, a wireless mesh network technology. At that time, the technology was in its infancy with only a handful of lighting products available from Advanced Control Technologies and Sylvania. As of 2015, the Z-Wave Alliance reported there were more than 1,400 Z-Wave certified products including light switches, thermostats, door locks, water valves, garage door controllers, sensors and other products. In 2004, HomeSeer released its first hardware product, the ZU0100-001 Z-Wave USB interface. This product functioned as a Z-Wave transceiver to allow HS1 software to communicate with wireless Z-Wave devices. =2005-2010= August 2005 marked the release of HS2 software. The new version was designed as a web application to allow for remote set up and configuration, as well as remote control. A professional version (HSPRO) targeting custom installers and featuring advanced Z-Wave support with pre-licensed plug-ins, was also released. In December, the company's first hardware controller (PRO-100) was released. The PRO-100 was a fan-less design with DOM storage that included an embedded installation of HSPRO software. In 2006, HomeSeer released the Z-Troller, a handheld Z-Wave network controller that doubled as a Z-Wave interface. Since Z-Troller was both a network controller and interface, it supported advanced features such as network optimization and network backup and restore. In October, the PRO-100 was upgraded to a faster Series II model. In 2007, HomeSeer released the HSM100, a battery operated Z-Wave 'multisensor' with built-in sensors for motion, temperature and light level. The HSM100 was well suited for home automation events that relied on some combination of its sensor data. HomeSeer's HomeTroller was also released in 2007 to provide functionality similar to the PRO-100 but at a lower price point. Unlike the PRO-100, the original HomeTroller was equipped with a conventional mechanical hard drive, active cooling (with fans) and embedded HS2 software. Subsequent versions were released with passive cooling (no fans) and with DOM, SD Card or SSD storage to improve reliability. In 2009, HomeSeer released its first mobile app, a software program called HSTouch. Originally developed for Apple's iOS platform, HSTouch gave HomeSeer users the ability to monitor and control their homes with their iPhones and iPods. A companion program, HSTouch Designer, was also released for those who wished to customize the mobile app with their own screen designs and graphics. In 2010, HomeSeer released its Android version of HSTouch mobile app. In September, HomeTroller was upgraded to the S3 model. =2011-2013= HomeTroller-SE was in production from 2011-2014 In 2011, HomeSeer released the HomeTroller-SE as its new entry level controller. The -SE model featured a less powerful CPU and fewer features than the standard HomeTroller model but at approximately half the cost. An even lower cost HomeTroller-Mini was also in the works with a prototype unit debuting at CES 2011. However, the HomeTroller-Mini design was later abandoned before release because of parts availability and cost issues. In 2013, HomeSeer released HS3, a significant upgrade to the HS2 version. HS3 included an all-new JQuery web GUI, redesigned automation 'engine', multi-network Z-Wave support and new counter and timer features. A professional version, HS3PRO, was also released to service the dealer channel. HomeSeer's HomeTroller Zee was also released in 2013. The Zee was based on the Raspberry Pi1 model B computer, included HS3 software and was bundled with an Aeon Labs Z-Stick Z-Wave interface. HomeTroller Zee replaced the HomeTroller-SE as the company's entry level home controller. =2014= In January 2014, HomeSeer introduced voice programming and automatic camera support for their controllers. Voice programming allowed users to create automation events solely by voice using any Android mobile device. Automatic camera support was designed to automatically detect and configure settings for Foscam brand IP cameras. This allowed the cameras to be viewed with the HSTouch mobile app. In March, HomeSeer released the model WFTT07 Control Pad free-standing 7\\" Android tabletop touchscreen embedded with their HSTouch mobile app. The unit was designed to function as a WiFi connected control portal for HomeSeer controllers. In April, HomeSeer launched MyHomeSeer-Remote (MyHS) remote access web service for HS3. MyHS simplified the process of enabling remote access to HomeSeer systems by eliminating the need to adjust router settings or use DDNS technology. MyHS was also designed to optimize connection performance in the home by automatically providing a direct LAN connection for users attempting to access their systems on the local sub-net. In September, HomeSeer released their HomeTroller-SEL to replace the HomeTroller-SE as the company's mid-level controller. Compared to the WindowsXP-based SE, the new SEL model included a faster CPU, twice the RAM and SSD storage, all running on a Debian distribution of Linux. Also in September, HomeSeer released their A2Z-Link Z-Wave bridge module and the HSM200 Z-Wave multi-sensor. * The A2Z-Link module was similar in design to the HomeTroller Zee but also included a newly developed protocol to allow other controller manufacturers to communicate with Z-Wave devices using simple JSON or ASCII commands. A2Z-Link was conceived as an OEM product; not intended for direct to consumer sales. * The new HSM200 was line-powered, allowing the unit to function as a Z-Wave repeater. HSM200 also included an RGB LED indicator that could be controlled by HomeSeer systems to change colors when things happened in the home. In November, the HomeTroller S6 becomes HomeSeer's new flagship home controller, replacing the PRO-100. =2015= In January 2015, HomeSeer released the Z-NET, an IP-enabled remote Z-Wave interface for use with its HS3-based systems. Since Z-NET works over a network connection, it can be placed nearly anywhere in the home and may also be used in outbuildings, vacation homes or other secondary residences. In April, HomeSeer launched its IFTTT channel. IFTTT is a web service that allows users to create recipes that connect products, services and apps from more than 200 different companies around the world. The principal benefit of launching the channel is that it provides web- based integration for products, services and apps for which there are no native HomeSeer drivers (plug-ins). For example, a HomeSeer/IFTTT user could activate the ESPN sports network IFTTT channel and create a recipe to launch a HomeSeer event to turn on their TV and speak an alert when a sporting event begins. In May, HomeSeer released its HomeTroller Zee S2 controller, based on the Raspberry Pi2 computer. Compared to the original Zee, the S2 model included a faster CPU, had twice the RAM and it included an internal Sigma 500 series Z-Wave module for native Z-Wave support. At the same time, several HomeSeer products underwent and achieved Z-Wave Plus certification. These products included HS3 software, HomeTroller Zee S2, HomeTroller-SEL, HomeTroller S6, Z-NET, SmartStick+ and A2Z-Link. In December, HomeSeer released its Skill (app) for the Amazon Echo. The Skill allows HomeSeer users to control their systems by voice using the Amazon Echo. =2016= In March 2016, HomeSeer released a line of Z-Wave Plus lighting products. The line included the HS-WS100+ wall switch, HS-WD100+ wall dimmer, HS-WA100+ wall accessory (for 3-way circuits), HS-PD100+ lamp module, HS-PA100+ appliance module and HS-DTA19+ smart light bulb.  Compatible Technologies & Products  Software is at the core of every system produced by HomeSeer. It's licensed as a stand-alone product (HS3) for users who wish to run it on their own personal computers. Its also pre-installed onto HomeTroller controllers, for users who prefer a more fully configured solution. HS3 systems are connected to the users home network and may be programmed with any web browser in a typical installation. Once programming is complete, the HS3 system will carry out automation functions unattended. If desired, the HSTouch mobile app may be used to monitor and manually control the products in the home. HomeSeer's MyHS web service is designed to provide remote internet access only and is not required for processing of automation events in the home.

William Crawford Smith (November 26, 1837 ‚Äì February 5, 1899) was an American architect who served in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War and in the United States Army during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. He designed many buildings in Nashville, Tennessee, including Kirkland Hall, the first building on the campus of Vanderbilt University, and the Parthenon in Centennial Park. Kirkland Hall on the Vanderbilt University campus, designed by Smith. Memorial Hall on the Cumberland University campus, designed by Smith. Early life William Crawford Smith was born on November 26, 1837 in Petersburg, Virginia. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee in the 1850s. During the American Civil War of 1861‚Äì1865, he returned to Virginia, joined the Confederate States Army and served as a sergeant and ensign in the 12th Virginia Infantry. He fought in the First Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Richmond, the Second Battle of Bull Run, and the Battle of Gettysburg. He was wounded twice in the war effort. The Parthenon in Nashville. Career After the war, Smith was an architect in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1874, he designed the Main Building of Vanderbilt University, later known as Kirkland Hall, as two French Gothic towers. The building burnt down in a fire in 1905, and it was later rebuilt with only one tower. Smith designed the Collier-Crichlow House in Murfreesboro, Tennessee in 1880 for Ingram Banks Collier III, who served as the mayor of Murfreesboro from 1872 to 1873. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 16, 1973. Smith was commissioned to design the Masonic Temple in Columbia, Tennessee in 1883. A decade later, in 1893, Smith designed the Colemere Mansion in Nashville for Confederate Colonel Edmund William Cole, who served as the President of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway after the war. The house burnt down in October 1929. Meanwhile, Smith designed Memorial Hall on the campus of Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee, built from 1892 to 1896. Additionally, Smith was commissioned to two buildings in Downtown Nashville in 1893: a four-storey building on the corner of Printer's Alley and Church Street and a five-story building at 317 North College Street. He was also commissioned to restore a three-story building at 315 North College Street. Meanwhile, in 1897, Smith designed The Parthenon in Centennial Park. Smith quit his architectural career to serve in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, where he commanded the 1st Tennessee Infantry Regiment of the United States Army in 1898‚Äì1899. Personal life Smith was married. They had several children, including a son, George J. Smith, who also served in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and a daughter, who married Hart B. Blanton. Smith was a Knight Templar. Death and legacy Smith died of heat exhaustion during the Battle of Manila February 5, 1899 on the Philippines. His corpse was shipped back to San Francisco, California, where it received a Masonic service. Shortly after, his corpse was returned to Nashville, where it lay in the Nashville Masonic Temple, followed by a service in the Tabernacle. He was buried on April 19, 1899 at the Mount Olivet Cemetery. In 1903, an honorary plaque from the Nashville Red Cross Society was installed inside the Parthenon. The ceremony was attended by Benton McMillin, who served as the Governor of Tennessee from 1899 to 1903. The Parthenon has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Davidson County since February 23, 1972.

Blessed Sacrament was founded in 1874 and its present-day church building was constructed in 1897. Its predecessor, St. Matthew's Church, was founded in 1848. Blessed Sacrament Church is listed as a New Rochelle Historic Site. , the church served 2,000 families. It educated students in the Blessed Sacrament School until a 1985 merger with St. Gabriel's High School to form Blessed Sacrament-St. Gabriel High School, which closed in 2013. Blessed Sacrament Church also serves four local nursing homes and maintains Holy Sepulchre Cemetery.  History  The first Catholic to settle in the hamlet of New Rochelle was Bernard Rooney in 1826. The first Catholic mass in the New Rochelle-area was celebrated in 1836 by Rev. Eugene Cummiskey at the house of George Govers on Huguenot Street near Memorial Highway.Lafort, Remigius. The Catholic Church in the United States of America, Vol. 3: The Province of Baltimore and the Province of New York, Section 1: Comprising the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn, Buffalo and Ogdensburg Together with some Supplementary Articles. (New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.419 With greater numbers of Catholics settling, Irish priest Fr. Matthew Higgins from St. Raymond's Church in the Bronx petitioned Archbishop Hughes to establish a church in New Rochelle in 1845. Archbishop Hughes agreed and purchased land on Drake Avenue, in the middle of the largest settlement of Irish immigrants in New Rochelle. In 1848, the church was constructed and named St. Matthew's Church in honor of Fr. Higgins. Fr. Edward O'Reilly was assigned in 1849 as the parish's first pastor. Four years later, Fr. Thomas McLoughlin succeeded Fr. O'Reilly as pastor and opened St. Matthew's Academy, the first Catholic school in New Rochelle, which was staffed by the Sisters of Charity, though it remained open for only one year. To accommodate more parishioners, the church was expanded in 1851. Blessed Sacrament began in 1853 a mission to Tuckahoe, which eventually became the Immaculate Conception Church. Recognizing the growing population of German Catholics in the Dutch Hill section of New Rochelle, a smaller, wooden church dedicated as the Church of the Blessed Sacrament was also built on Centre Avenue in 1874. Another school was constructed five years later with bricks salvaged by parishioners from the dismantled St. Matthew's Church, which later closed for financial reasons. Fr. McLoughlin opened Holy Sepulchre Cemetery on Highland Avenue in 1886. In 1890, lightning struck and set fire to the Blessed Sacrament church. The building was destroyed, with only the bell and cellar surviving. St. Matthew's School was used for church functions in the interim. The parish began construction on the present-day stone, Gothic Revival church, which was completed and dedicated in 1897. This building was made larger to account for a growing number of Italian immigrants now living in the West End of New Rochelle. The interior of the new church was decorated with 53 oil paintings by reputed artist Francesco Baraldi, while the depiction of the Blessed Sacrament above the altar was painting by G. Caponi. Ursuline nuns from the College of New Rochelle began instructing children in religious education who attended public schools in 1914 and continued to do so until 1995. Fr. McLoughlin died while saying mass at the foot of the altar in 1902 and his nephew, Fr. Thomas P. McLoughlin (who parishioners referred to as \\"Young Father Tom\\"), assumed the role of pastor. During his time, a new school building was constructed in 1923. \\"Old Father Tom\\" was buried where the church bell fell during the fire that destroyed the original wooden building. In 1940, Fr. Matthew Delaney became pastor and founded a boys' high school, which was staffed by Christian Brothers. Msgr. Francis Shea took over as pastor in 1947. He purchased and renovated a building on Beauchamp Place in 1963, which came to be the new location of the high school. Because Msgr. Shea was well- liked in New Rochelle, Beauchamp Place was eponymously renamed Shea Place. One year later, Msgr. Shea died and was buried near Fr. McLoughlin on the grounds of the church. The Blessed Sacrament School was merged with St. Gabriel's High School in 1985, forming Blessed Sacrament-St. Gabriel High School. At its peak, Blessed Sacrament enrolled 250 students in its elementary school, 277 students in high school and educated 600 public school students in its CCD religious education program. The school was closed in 2013 along with several other schools in Westchester County by the Archdiocese of New York. Recognizing several structural deficiencies and the notable aesthetic value of the church, a major restoration project was undertaken by the parish with the assistance of the Archdiocese in 2011, which cost just under $1 million.

The suffix -vad means ford. The name √òrholm is first documented in 1670 in the form √òerholmen. The watermill was originally a grain mill but was adapted for use in the production of gunpowder in 1558. The mill was owned by the crown and was modernized in the 1620 with inspiration from the Netherlands. Ole J√∏rgen Rawert: √òrholm, September 1846 In 1653, √òrholm was sold to Herman Isenberg. He was obliged to provide the state with all needed supplies of gunpowder but could also sell to private customers. The gunpowder was stored in a gunpowder magazine at Copenahgen's N√∏rreport city gate and was for instance used in the defence of the city during the Assault on Copenhagen The watermill changed several times over the next fifty years. Albrecht Heins, who also owned Lundtofte, owned √òrholm from 1670-72\\\\. Peder Griffenfeld, who was a personal friend of Heins as well as of several of the other owners, was a frequent visitor to the place. In 1716, an explosion resulted in the death of two workers and the loss of 300 kg of gunpowder. √òrholm in 1860 In 1724, √òrholm was acquired by royal coppersmith Poul Badstuber who already owned the operations at Brede and Nym√∏lle. He adapted √òrholm for use in the production of copper and iron goods. In 1742, Badstuber had to sell √òrholm in auction. The buyer was In 1793, two Englishmen, Henry Nelthropp and John Joseph Harris, converted the factory into a paper mill which mainly produced print paper, wallpaper and blue wrapping paper. √òrholm Mill in 1920 The following year they expanded their business with the acquisition of Nym√∏lle. From 1830 the company was in decline due to the competition from the much larger paper manufacturer Strandm√∏llen further downstream. In 1854, √òrholm and Nym√∏lle were sold to the owners of Strandm√∏llen and became part of a Danish de facto paper monopoly. The operations at √òrholm was modernized with the introduction of steam power and water turbines. Production of paper ceased in 1922. Lama, a manufacturer of wollen og wollen blankets and spring mattress, was based at √òrholm from 1930 until 1977. The buildings were then purchased by the state and is now used by National Museum as a storage. √òrholm House √òrholm House (Danish: √òrholm Hovedg√•rd) was built as a residence for the director of the factory. The architect or exact time of construction is unknown but it is assumed that it was built for Lauritz Stubs since it is known that he applied for permission to transport a large load of bricks through J√¶gersborg Dyrehave in 1753. When √òrholm was merged with Strandm√∏llen by J.C. Drewsen & S√∏nner in 1854, the need for the building disappeared and it was instead rented out. The first tenant was the officer and politician Anton Frederik Tscherning, who had served as Denmark's first Minister of Defence after the adoption of the Constitution in 1849, and who lived in it with his wife, the painter and writer Eleonora Tscherning. From 1866, Christian Drewsen's daughter Ophelia took over the house, together with her husband, the National Liberal editor Godske Nielsen. The house has later changed hands many times. One of the later owners was Paul Fenneberg, a former mayor of Lyngby Taarb√¶k, who owned the house 1933-1982. √òrholm Station √òrholm Station is located on the N√¶rum Railway and is served by the railway company Lokaltog.

Lee's father was the fourth person to receive medical license in Korea after graduating from Severance Medical College whilst her mother was a faithful Methodist born in family devoted to Korean traditional medicine. When Lee was 18, her mother died and this led to her decision to live up to three principles: not getting married, staying healthy and studying, according to her book \\"To Accompany.\\" Moreover, her deep faith in Methodism and continued academic endeavours are hugely influenced by her mother. Lee graduated from Ewha Girls' High School.  Education  Lee attended Humanities and Arts department of Ewha College in 1942. However, she couldn't graduate due to Japanese rule's policies.

They are found in sandy deserts and other xeric habitats in northwestern Mexico and in southwest United States. They are among the largest of all scorpion genera, only surpassed by Hadogenes, Pandinus, Heterometrus and Hoffmannihadrurus.  Taxonomy  There are currently 7 species of this genus which are recognized: * Hadrurus anzaborrego Soleglad, Fet & Lowe, 2011 * Hadrurus arizonensis Ewing, 1928 * Hadrurus concolorous Stahnke, 1969 * Hadrurus hirsutus Wood, 1863 * Hadrurus obscurus Williams, 1970 * Hadrurus pinteri Stahnke, 1969 * Hadrurus spadix Stahnke, 1940 Two species (H. aztecus and H. gertschi) were separated and placed in the genus Hoffmannihadrurus based on the larger distance between the lateral eyes and the anterior margin of the carapace as well as the shorter distance between the median eyes and the lateral eyes. Distances between the lateral and median eyes and the anterior edge of the carapace in the genera Hadrurus and Hoffmannihadrurus.  General characteristics  The species of this genus are large (up to a max of 15 cm) and hairy scorpions with yellowish tones through their bodies although there is an exception in Hadrurus spadix, a species which has a dark almost black prosoma and mesosoma while the palps, legs and metasoma are yellow in color. Not the palps nor the metasoma are in any way reduced in size. = Toxicity = Though not considered to have a dangerously toxic venom, its sting is still quite painful and unlike other big species of scorpions which defend themselves using their powerful palps to pinch the attacker. The species of Hadrurus prefer to sting.  Behaviour  The species of this genus are quite active through the night foraging for food or a potential mate. They are avid burrowers, preferring somewhat (but not completely) loose soil such as dried sand to make their burrows. If loose soil is not available, they can take shelter beneath rocks and dead plants such as Opuntia and Cylindropuntia during the day. It bears live young which are guarded by the female until they undergo their first molt.

Central Business District (CBD) is the historic city center of what has become Greater Downtown Miami, in Miami, Florida, United States. It is generally bound by Biscayne Boulevard, Bayfront Park and Museum Park on the east, the Miami River to the south, North 6th Street to the north, and Interstate 95 to the west. While it is technically Miami's official \\"downtown\\", the term \\"Downtown Miami\\" has come to refer to a much larger area along the bay from the Rickenbacker Causeway to the Julia Tuttle Causeway. It is also distinct from the financial district, which in this case is neighboring Brickell to the south. However, the downtown core has over of office space, including more than fifteen buildings with greater than of floor space. History The Burdine's Department Store, built in 1912, is located in the very heart of Miami at Miami Avenue and Flagler Street, which divide the Miami Grid street numbering pattern. The City of Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896 with a population of just over 300. Downtown is the historic heart of Miami, and along with Coconut Grove, is the oldest settled area of Miami, with early pioneer settlement dating to the early 19th century. Urban development began in the 1890s with the construction of the Florida East Coast Railway by Standard Oil industrialist Henry Flagler down to Miami at the insistence of Julia Tuttle. Flagler, along with developers such as William Brickell and George E. Merrick helped bring developer interest to the city with the construction of hotels, resorts, homes, and the extension of Flagler's rail line. Flagler Street, originating in Downtown, is a major east-west road in Miami named after the tycoon; the Julia Tuttle Causeway, crossing Biscayne Bay just north of Downtown in Edgewater, is named in honor of Tuttle. Character Looking west down Flagler Street The CBD has long been dense with retail and office space, as well as some lofts and apartments, but recently has seen large scale high-rise residential development as during Miami housing market booms in the aughts and continuing again in the 2010s. Though the historically wealthy suburb of Brickell to the south remains much more popular, downtown has seen urban buildings such as The Loft, The Loft 2, and Centro Lofts which have no built- in parking as well as more traditional luxury condos such as the bayfront 50 Biscayne and Vizcayne. Wolfson Campus, the primary (but not largest) campus of Miami-Dade College is located in the CBD, with about ten buildings around NE 5 Street and NE 2 Ave. The historic Flagler Street, which is the north-south divider of the street grid in Miami-Dade, may undergo a major renovation from the Miami River to the terminus at Biscayne Boulevard starting by 2016. The project was publicized in 2014 and has faced several delays. =Transportation= The Metromover Inner Loop is located entirely within the CBD, as is Metrorail's Government Center station, where the rapid transit and people mover systems meet. This is the busiest station for both systems and sees over 15,000 riders on an average weekday. It is located on the west side of downtown in the Government Center area, which has a large concentration of city, county, state, and federal offices. The area is also heavily served by the Metrobus (Miami-Dade County) and Miami Trolley, vehicle for hire companies including taxicabs and Uber, and carsharing services such as Car2Go. Downtown Miami as defined by Walk Score which includes Brickell and the Arts & Entertainment District, is considered \\"very walkable\\" and as having \\"world- class public transportation\\", as well as being \\"very bikeable\\".

His research has focused on how several counterbalancing narratives of World WarII and the Holocaust can co-exist, with the goal of demystifying and explaining their impact on popular culture.Jonathan Petropoulos, John Roth (eds) (2005): Gray Zones: Ambiguity and Compromise in the Holocaust and its Aftermath  The Myth of the Eastern Front  Together with fellow historian Edward J. Davies of the University of Utah, Smelser is the author of the 2008 book The Myth of the Eastern Front: The Nazi-Soviet War in American Popular Culture. It discusses perceptions of the Eastern Front of World WarII in the United States in the context of historical revisionism. The book traces the foundation of the post-war myth of the \\"clean Wehrmacht\\", its support by U.S. military officials, and the impact of Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS mythology on American popular culture, including in the present time. The book garnered largely positive reviews for its thorough analysis of the myth's creation by German ex-participants and its entry into American culture. Several reviews noted some limitations of the book: in its discussion of the myth's role in contemporary culture and the extent of its impact on widely held popular perceptions of the Eastern Front, outside of a few select groups. Foreign Affairs magazine called the book a \\"fascinating exercise in historiography\\", highlighting the authors' analysis of how a \\"number of Hitler's leading generals were given an opportunity to write the history of the Eastern Front (...) provid[ing] a sanitized version of events\\". Military historian Jonathan House reviewed the book for The Journal of Military History, describing it as a \\"tour deforce of cultural historiography\\" and commending the authors for \\"hav[ing] performed a signal service by tracing the origin and spread of this mythology\\". House recommends that military historians not only study the book, but \\"use it to teach students the dangers of bias and propaganda in history\\". A review published in the journal History provided a critical assessment of the book. While it praises Smelser and Davies for setting out the main myths concerning the Eastern Front, the review argues that they did not provide convincing evidence to support their argument that most Americans accept such an account. It concludes that \\"the book therefore delivers a rather weak conclusion, which dilutes the impact of the useful analysis earlier in the book...\\" Likewise, American historian Dennis Showalter acknowledges that the romanticised views described in the book exist, but argues that they remain limited in their impact on the wider popular culture: \\"Eastern Front enthusiasts‚Äîwho buy a disproportionate number of the books romanticizing the Eastern Front‚Äîare a minority within a minority, and, as a rule, are at some pains to deny sympathy with the Third Reich\\". The reviewer concludes that the opening of the Russian archives since the fall of the Soviet Union has enabled \\"balanced analysis at academic levels\\", leading to a new interest in the Red Army operations from popular history writers and World WarII enthusiasts.

History  The Gnowangerup Star and Tambellup Ongerup Gazette was established in 1915 by Augustine Walker, with the first issue published on Saturday 28 August 1915. The name was changed in 1942 when it became the Gnowangerup Star. The newspaper was continued by Augustine's son, Issac Walker. He was assisted by his wife, Margaret, and their two sons, Bill and Roderick. Margaret Walker was the editor, photographer and reporter. She took over the running of the newspaper after Issac had a stroke in 1986. At that time, the newspaper had a circulation of 1000 within the shires of Gnowangerup and Jerramungup in the southern Wheatbelt. It was one of Western Australia's oldest family owned newspapers and was still set on linotypes up until its closure in 2003. The closure was caused by a number of factors, including insufficient finance to expand the business, declining local populations and the overhead costs.

The bike was also known as the Type D and Model D, and was the first of a series of models from Honda to be named Dream. The D-Type was produced from 1949 to 1951. Pre-D-Type history In October 1946 Soichiro Honda established Honda Gijutsu Kenkyu Sho (Honda Technical Research Laboratory). The company was based in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka prefecture. Their earliest product was a motorized bicycle, called a pon-pon in the Hamamatsu area. Honda's pon-pon used a WWII surplus generator engine made by Mikuni Shoko and a belt-drive to power the rear wheel. When the supply of surplus motors was gone Honda designed a unique two-stroke engine as a replacement. This engine had rotary valves, a stepped-diameter piston and a tall extension to the cylinder head that caused it to be nicknamed the 'chimney'. This engine was not put into production, and the engineering drawings were subsequently lost. One copy was recreated by Honda engineers in 1996 and put on display in the Honda Collection Hall. A second, more conventional, two-stroke engine that still used rotary valves was designed next. Designated the A-Type, this engine was later nicknamed 'bata-bata' for its distinctive sound. The A-Type engine displaced and developed @ 5000 rpm. Beginning in November 1946 the engine was installed into converted bicycles that, like the engine, were known as the A-Type. In February 1948 Honda established a new engine manufacturing plant at Noguchi-cho. On 24 September of the same year Honda reorganized his company and incorporated it as Honda Giken Kogyo (Honda Motor Company). 1948 was also the year that Honda developed a small cargo carrier called the B-Type. The chassis of steel channel was built by outside suppliers and was laid out as a tricycle with a single front wheel in a girder fork and a cargo box between the two rear wheels. Power came from an engine. The vehicle proved unstable and was cancelled before it went beyond the prototype stage. The C-Type that followed was another belt-driven two-wheeler. It had a tubular frame designed by Honda and built by contractors that kept the bicycle pedals of Honda's previous models and the girder fork from the B-Type. The C-Type engine displaced and produced . Sales of the C-Type started in 1949. Features The D-Type featured an air-cooled two-stroke single-cylinder engine like that of the C-Type but with displacement increased to and power at @ 5000 rpm. The carburetor was in the front of the engine and exhaust in the rear. The ignition was powered by a magneto, and the bike was started with a kick-start assisted by a decompressor. The transmission was a two-speed semi-automatic unit that integrated the clutch with the gear pedal; the first use of such a transmission in a motorcycle. The rear wheel was driven by a chain rather than a belt. Brakes were drums front and rear. A toolkit was mounted under the seat in a cylindrical holder. The D-Type was the first Honda model without bicycle pedals. The frame of the D-Type was not made of steel tubes, but rather of sheets of steel that had been pressed into shape. The design of the frame was said to have been influenced by German motorcycles like the star-framed BMW R11 and R16. The D-Type's frame is also reminiscent of the Asahi AA built by Miyata in Japan in the 1930s. The front suspension used telescopic forks, while the rear end was rigid. The bike came with a full lighting system, an upright seating position, and a rear luggage rack. Model history The first D-Type was completed in August 1949. Production began at the company's Hamamatsu factory. By late 1949 frames for the D-Type were being produced in the Yamashita plant in Hamamatsu and engines were coming from the Noguchi-cho plant. Officially the origin of the Dream name is unknown. The most commonly reported story is that at a party to celebrate the completion of the D-Type an employee spontaneously remarked \\"It's like a dream!\\" Honda felt that the D-Type was a step on the path to fulfilling his own aspirations, and made the bike's official name \\"Dream Type D\\". The D-Type proved popular and sales were good to begin with. Shortly afterwards the effects of the United States' occupationary General Headquarters (GHQ) program of fiscal austerity called the Dodge Line began pushing Japan's economy into recession and putting pressure on Honda. In August 1949 Honda met with Takeo Fujisawa at the home of mutual friend Hiroshi Takeshima. Fujisawa joined the Honda Motor Company in October 1949 as managing director. He would be responsible for financial matters and sales while leaving design and production to Honda. After discovering that their distributors were installing more D-Type engines into competitor Kitagawa's frames than selling D-Type motorcycles, Fujisawa told them that if they wanted to sell the D-Type, they would have to become Honda distributors exclusively and could no longer mount Honda engines in frames bought from other manufacturers. Fujisawa was threatened physically because of this policy, and Honda lost some distributors because of it, but this also opened new sales areas for the company. The Korean war broke out on 25 June 1950, and the US military's special procurement purchases for the conflict boosted the economy in general and Honda's fortunes specifically. In Autumn 1950 Honda bought a former sewing machine plant in Kita ward in Tokyo, outfitted it for production of D-Types and installed a conveyor system to speed assembly. Assembly of the D-Type was moved to this location. Honda received a Bicycle Industry Grant of ¬•400,000 from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in October 1950 and an additional ¬•100,000 Bicycle Innovation Grant in December, which enabled Honda to increase production of the D-Type to 167 units per month by the end of the year and 300 units per month after that. By the end of 1950 production of the D-Type was over 3500 units. Sales of the D-Type began to slow. Honda recognized that some owners did not like the semi-automatic transmission. The two-speed transmission required the rider to keep constant pressure on the shift pedal while riding or the transmission would drop into neutral. Also, while tube- framed bikes were liable to break on Japan's poor roads of the time, they were considered better looking than the pressed-steel D-Type. The bikes' narrow space between the tire and fender was prone to filling with mud. Competitors had introduced four-stroke motorcycles, and Fujisawa told Honda that their motorcycle was not selling well was because its two-stroke made \\"unpleasant, high-pitched noises\\". Honda would address these issues with his next motorcycle, the E-Type, which was unveiled in 1951. Honda did not export motorcycles from Japan until 1952, when the Type-F Cub was introduced to Taiwan. Any bikes that made it out of Japan prior to that did so by the efforts of individual owners. Honda considers the D-Type their first motorcycle, and they count their motorcycle production milestones from the start of production of the D-Type.

It was first discovered in 1988, and the full description was published in 2015, in the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. It is so far found only on Luzon, the largest island in the Philippines. The first specimen was collected from Mount Isarog at the southern side of the island. Other 14 specimens were later collected. It is the fourth species of mammal (so far known) living only on that mountain. The new species was described by Danilo S. Balete, Eric A. Rickart, Lawrence R. Heaney, and Sharon A. Jansa. It was classified as new species based on DNA analyses and structural descriptions (morphometrc analyses). It is different from its closest relative, the Luzon hairy-tailed rat (Batomys granti), in its cytochrome b sequence, moderate body size, colour patterns, and skull structure. Etymology The specific name uragon is a Bicol word, the language of the local people, the Bicolanos in Luzon. Having no direct English rendering, the word is loosely translated as \\"possessing great ability, vitality, or power\\". This is to attribute the species for its dispersal ability, persistence, and uniqueness to the Bicol Peninsula. Discovery The first specimen (now the holotype) of B. uragon was collected by Eric A. Rickart, Curator of Vertebrates at the Natural History Museum of Utah, on 25 April 1988. It is an old adult male. He found it while in the faunal expedition at Mount Isarog, about 4 km from the Naga City in Camarines Sur Province. The expedition was funded by U.S. National Science Foundation and the Smithsonian Institution. The rat was in the mossy forest, at about 1,750 m above the sea level. Later, 14 specimens were collected from around the same region. The specimens are deposited at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. DNA studies were performed by Sharon A. Jansa. Description Of the species of Batomys known to live on Mount Isarog, the large-toothed hairy-tailed rat (B. dentatus) is distinct. But B. granti is basically similar to B. uragon. B. uragon differs from B. granti in slightly larger body, longer legs, but shorter tail, and larger skull. Males are larger than females. Males measure 19.83 cm in length, while females are 18.82 cm, a centimetre smaller. This sexual dimorphism is almost absent in B. granti, as both males and females are about 19 cm long. The tail length is 14.4 cm in males, and 14.16 cm in females. The total body weight is 178 g for males, and 177 g for females. Karyotype shows that it has 52 chromosomes (haploid, n=26). The colour of the fur is pale golden-brown. There are colour variations in individuals. One male specimen has a small pale brown patch of fur on the left side of the lower abdomen. The holotype has a pale golden fur, paler than other specimens. Biology B. uragon only live in high altitude region, between 1350‚Äì1800 m asl. They live in old-growth montane and mossy forest, where there are thick leaf litters and humus layers. They eat nuts and seeds, hence, they have granivorous-frugivorous diet. They are nocturnal and good climbers.

As an alderman, Arena was noted as an advocate for developing affordable housing, even in communities where local residents opposed it.

He then filed complaints with their respective departments accusing them of making \\"racially charged\\" comments. In December of 2019, after 2 years of investigations, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability announced allegations made against 29 of the 31 officers accused were groundless. The investigation is still going on for the firefighters accused, with none of the accusations yet to be proven.

It also was the Chinese President's first visit to the United Kingdom since 2005 and the second Chinese state leader to visit the UK after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's visit between 16 and 19 June 2014. During the visit, Xi met Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister David Cameron, and also visited Manchester City F.C.. Background The vice-director of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, Feng Zhongping, said China‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations were warming rapidly. In March 2015, the United Kingdom joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. In September, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne visited China. Feng said this visit would bring an improvement in Anglo-Chinese relations. The increasingly warm relationship has led some political analysts to describe it as a \\"special relationship\\". An article by CNN analyst Katie Hunt posits that a key reason for the increase in relations is due in part to Britain's avoidance of raising sensitive political issues such as the Chinese claims in the South China Sea, although she noted that issues such as the Tibetan independence movement could still cause tensions between the two nations. Process =19 October: Arrival at London= On 19 October 2015 Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, arrived at Heathrow Airport and stepped off an Air China aircraft. They were greeted on behalf of the Queen by Viscount Hood and the UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. =20 October: Met Queen Elizabeth II, publish the speech and state dinner= Xi Jinping published the speech at the Palace of Westminster Xi met with Charles, Prince of Wales On 20 October Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh hosted the ceremony to welcome Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan at the Horse Guards Parade. The British welcomed Xi Jinping with a 41-gun salute in Green Park and a simultaneous 62-gun salute at the Tower of London and City of London (103 guns in total). During this visit, supporters of Xi ‚Äì primarily Chinese students at British universities ‚Äì waved flags and banners and carried a dragon spelling out the message \\"Welcome Big Buddy Xi\\". Photographs later produced by Amnesty UK showing diplomatic cargo boxes full of flags prior to the visit showed \\"that the Chinese embassy has been shipping in flags, hats, T-shirts and other pro-China merchandise as diplomatic baggage in order to put on a show of strength and support for the visiting President\\", according to a spokesperson for Amnesty International. Chinese officials are believed to have wanted their security personnel to carry guns and for anti-Chinese protests to be banned completely. The Metropolitan Police refused on both accounts, and activists of Falun Gong and the Free Tibet Campaign convened to demonstrate against China's human rights abuses and to call for the UK government to put human rights on the visit's agenda. Two Tibetan women were arrested under Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 and had their homes raided under Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 after flying a Tibetan flag near President Xi's car, as well as computer equipment seized. Shao Jiang, a survivor of the Tiananmen Square massacre who also had her computer seized and home raided by police while in custody, said that the events reminded her of the repression she experienced in China prior to her exile. The Falun Gong followers called for former chief of the Communist Party leader, Jiang Zemin, to be brought to justice for the persecution of its practitioners. Before this visit, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn promised to raise human rights issues, but China ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said this visit would focus on partnership and cooperation between the two countries. Xi and Peng had lunch with the Queen, viewed the Royal Collection's Chinese artefacts, and exchanged gifts with the Royals, giving them two albums of Peng Liyuan's music. In the afternoon, Xi Jinping made a speech at the Palace of Westminster. He focused on historic bi-national ties, law and order, and China's burgeoning economy in this speech. He also cited Shakespeare's The Tempest, that \\"what's past is prologue\\". Later Xi Jinping visited the Clarence House, the residence of Prince William, and had tea with the prince. In the evening, Xi and Peng arrived for a state banquet at the Buckingham Palace, hosted by the Queen. Xi also met with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. After the banquet, Xi and Peng stayed two nights at the palace in the Belgian Suite. =21 October: Met David Cameron, Business Summit, and visiting events On 21 October Xi Jinping talked with British Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street. At this talk, Xi and Cameron signed 40 billion pound business agreements. The British Government announced the UK will extend the standard Chinese visitor visas from six months to two years. Also Merlin Entertainments signed an agreement with China Media Capital to establish a Legoland in Shanghai. After the talk, they signed a cybersecurity pact at the press conference. They also talked about the issue of human rights. Xi and Cameron attended the UK-China business summit at Mansion House, where the focus was on investment, infrastructure and innovation. Later Xi visited Imperial College London, Lancaster House and the London Office of Huawei, a leading Chinese telecommunications company. In the evening Xi attended the banquet hosted by the Lord Mayor of London Alan Yarrow at the City of London. 22 October: Visiting events and Met at Chequers Xi continued his 4th day's itinerary on 22 October. He and his wife Peng Liyuan left the Buckingham Palace. Later Xi attended the Opening Ceremony of Annual Conference of UK Confucius Institutes and Classrooms with Prince Andrew. He and Prince Andrew together unveiled the plaque of the 1000th Confucius Classroom at Hautlieu School, which was hosted by Hautlieu School of Jersey and Beijing Bayi High School. Xi also visited Inmarsat with the Duke of York and Liu Xiaoming. Peng Liyuan visited Royal Academy of Music with Prince William and his wife Kate. She also visited the Brussels Musical Instrument Museum. Later, Xi and Cameron have held talks at Chequers. Cameron was expected to raise concerns over Hong Kong directly with Xi, but there was no mention of this in the statement. Cameron also takes Xi to traditional British pub for beers and fish and chips, the English traditional dish. Xi left London and arrived at Manchester at 10 pm. 23 October: Manchester Visit On 23 October Xi visited Manchester. He visited the National Graphene Institute of the University of Manchester with Professor Nancy Rothwell, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University, alongside George Osborne, Lord Jim O‚ÄôNeill and the Minister for the Northern Powerhouse, James Wharton. Later Xi visited Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Football Academy and the exhibition of football history. He also witnessed former Manchester City defender Sun Jihai being inducted into the National Football Hall of Fame and took a selfie with Sergio Ag√ºero. Before Xi left, he visited the Airport City Manchester project. He also announced Hainan Airlines will launch non-stop flights between Beijing and Manchester. Controversy The British officials said that the China-UK business transactions were highly exaggerated and Britain would continue to tightly regulate the nuclear industry. In May 2016, Queen Elizabeth II was filmed making an unguarded remark that the Chinese \\"were very rude to the ambassador\\", and that it was \\"bad luck\\" for the Metropolitan police commander Lucy D‚ÄôOrsi that she had to be responsible for security during the state visit.

Reza Rioter (Majnoun) (Persian: ÿ±ÿ∂ÿß ÿ±€åŸàÿ™ÿ±) is an Iranian graffiti artist. He first began creating graffiti in 2006 in Kashan, Iran. Because of his art and influence, featured in Graffiti Iran Magazine, among others, people know Kashan as one of the first Iranian cities to feature graffiti and street art. In an essay on graffiti artists in Iran, Art Radar wrote: \\"Although Iran has in recent years initiated a variety of urban beautification projects featuring monumental murals in the urban landscape, most street artists still have to work underground due to state censorship and the illegal status of graffiti.\\" In 2016, Culture Trip, an online magazine, wrote about Iran's graffiti artists: \\"They spray Tehran‚Äôs city walls with vibrant colors, oppose social injustice with visual provocation and defy the law with their artistic statements.\\" Career As an amateur rapper, Reza Rioter started his career in Kashan. Upon taking up graffiti in 2006 he decided to change focus from music to art. From 2006 through 2011 he created most of his graffiti in the city of Aran va Bidgol. During that time, in 2010 Rioter used the web as a promotional platform to promote his art of graffiti with a change in style and presentation, using Persian letters so more viewers could read his art. He is one of the first artists to gain recognition for graffiti in Persian. Afterwards, for almost two years until 2013, he stayed active in the city of Ghotb Ravandi Bolvar. Since 2013, he has created graffiti on the main streets of Kashan, including 15 Khordad Square and various other places. Internet marketing Understanding that social media and the internet are a path for wider recognition, many Iranian graffiti artists have shared their work online and gained popularity. Reza Rioter occasionally publishes his talents online. His Facebook page is @RezaRioterGraffiti, which he established in 2012. He established his Twitter handle @RezaRioter in 2016. His Instagram account is @Reza_Rioter. He has attempted to establish himself in the genre of modern art, but said it was extraordinarily difficult to do so in a traditional city, such as Kashan, which has a conservative culture. In late 2015, the Huffington Post published an article profiling 'Iranian street artists' and exploring how the artists are \\"spreading freedom, expression and love through visually striking and politically charged graphic imagery.\\" Recent activities and controversies Rioter has published online essays about graffiti. In 2014 he published his first \\"videograf,\\" a video of graffiti art, on various websites, including Facebook, where his post garnered over 17,000 views. In recent years, Reza Rioter has appeared in numerous videografs. In 2015 he released his second videograf, honoring Sohrab Sepehri, a poet from Kashan. In the video, Reza Rioter asked why there is graffiti on Sohrab Sepehri Street in Kashan. Reza Rioter also took part in a radio program about graffiti. The program represented the first documentary by the government media of Iran, exploring graffiti art. After its airing, Reza Rioter said his comments had been significantly censored. Recently, Rioter graffitied a wall on the main street of Kashan. It was later draped in a cloth. The municipality had issued him a license to create the art, but then covered it up. After a few days, it allowed him to finish his graffiti before expunging it again, allegedly under pressure from higher authorities. Arrests In 2015, Rioter was arrested by the morality police in Kashan and charged with creating graffiti. He was held in Kashan Prison for four days in Ward 4.

He was born at Horbury, West Yorkshire and died at Sedbergh, now in Cumbria. He was known to his contemporaries as \\"Jack Shilton\\". At birth, his surname was registered as \\"Shelton\\". Professional cricketer Shilton was an itinerant professional cricketer who had engagements across the 1880s and 1890s with clubs in the North of England, Yorkshire, Kent and the West Midlands, where he settled from about 1885; he played in minor matches for Durham, Northumberland and Yorkshire before becoming involved with Warwickshire in 1885. He then played in every one of the county's matches for the next 10 seasons, though only in 1894 and 1895 were the games rated as first-class. Shilton was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a left-arm bowler variously described as slow orthodox spin and medium-pace with the ability to \\"break both ways and vary his pace without in any way altering his action\\". His best bowling was achieved before Warwickshire gained first-class status: in the match against Leicestershire in 1888, for example, he finished the game with four wickets in four balls. Despite not playing for a major team, Shilton was selected for occasional first-class representative matches across the 1880s, appearing in the North v South game in 1884 and in England XIs against the 1886 and 1888 Australians. He was credited, alongside Harry Pallett, with the bowling prowess that led to Warwickshire's elevation to first-class status, and Lord Hawke was quoted as saying, when Warwickshire was a \\"second class\\" county, that \\"Shilton was the only first-class man in the team\\". Character Shilton was not lacking in self-confidence: he was, according to his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, \\"quite a character... though he had his faults\\". Other stories about him indicate a degree of arrogance. \\"He earned the name of Lord Warwick on account of his haughty bearing, and he had a very high opinion of his own powers,\\" said one obituary. It added, however, \\"with all his faults, and unfortunately they were many, Shilton was popular for his remarkable optimism, his good nature, and for his undoubted ability\\". Later career By the time he played regular first-class cricket in 1894, those abilities were on the wane, though he managed to take 50 first-class wickets at a respectable average of 20.82 in his only full season. His best bowling figures in first-class games came in the match against Nottinghamshire when he took seven second-innings wickets for 73 runs. By 1895, he was ill with the tuberculosis that killed him four years later, and he played in only four matches; one of those was a benefit match for him which was intended to raise funds to help him to go to South Africa, where it was hoped he might recover. Typically, Shilton spent the money, but well-wishers and events such as a \\"smoking concert\\" subscribed enough for him to make the trip. He got into unspecified trouble in South Africa, however, and returned to England in 1897; too ill to continue his cricket career, he lived with his father in Sedbergh until his death.

Some kinds of storage media, such as flash memory and CD-RW, slowly degrade as they are written to and have a limited number of erase/write cycles at any one location. Log-structured file systems are sometimes used on these media because they make fewer in-place writes and thus prolong the life of the device by wear leveling. The more common such file systems include: * UDF is a file system commonly used on optical discs. * JFFS and its successor JFFS2 are simple Linux file systems intended for raw flash- based devices. * UBIFS is a filesystem for raw NAND flash media and also intended to replace JFFS2. * LogFS is a scalable flash filesystem for Linux that works on both raw flash media and block devices, intended to replace JFFS2. * YAFFS is a raw NAND flash-specific file system for many operating systems (including Linux). * F2FS is a new file system designed for the NAND flash memory-based storage devices on Linux.

Fort Vastenburg (Dutch \\"Fort Steadfast\\"), also Fort Surakarta, is an 18th-century Dutch fort located in Gladak, Surakarta, Indonesia. A landmark of Surakarta, the fort faces polemics related with multiple owners claiming different parts of the fort. As a result, the fort remains abandoned and threatened to be demolished by various private parties claiming the fort's ownership. Description Fort Vastenburg is a square shaped fort with four bastions. It is surrounded by 6 meter high bearing wall and dry moat. Three portals providing entrance to the fort from the east, west, and north. A draw bridge used to provide access point to the fort's western main portal, however this has been demolished. History A drawbridge to the fort. There are differing opinions about the construction date of Fort Vastenburg. Most agreed that Fort Vastenburg was constructed in 1743 and was completed in 1745, following the order of Governor-General Baron van Imhoff. First named de Grootmoedigheid (\\"magnanimity\\"), later the fort name was renamed to Vastenburg (\\"steadfast\\") (1750). There is another claim that the de Grootmoedigheid was different with Fort Vastenburg. In this claim, construction of Fort Vastenburg was started in 1755 and completed in 1779, replacing a trading post de Grootmoedigheid which was constructed in 1743 close to Bandar Beton near Bengawan Solo. De Grootmoedigheid was one of a series of defense network set up by the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) to maintain security in the Javanese trade network. The main function of the fort was to house the resident (colonial administrator) and the Dutch East Indies garrison for the region of Central Java. The fort maintained order in Surakarta, especially between the royalties. Unlike the relatively united Yogyakarta royal court, the Sunanate of Surakarta was fractious. By 1757, Pakubuwono II faced a local rebellion from his royal relative Raden Mas Said. Under the Dutch Treaty of Salatiga, Raden Mas Said decided to build his own (smaller) palace ‚Äî Kraton Mangkunegaran ‚Äî establishing a second royal court in the city. This weakened the city's sense of integrity, and so Fort Vastenburg have the possible conflict between royalties checked. Fort Vastenburg was further improved between 1772 and 1788. In the 19th century, the interior of the fort contains a number of military buildings surrounding a central courtyard. The buildings include residence for the member of the military (e.g. the Commander, the Captain, and the Lieutenant), a military hospital, a drugstore. During the French-influenced government of Daendels, it was decided that a fort system was no longer the best strategy to maintain order in the colonial empire. Defense strategy was changed from centered defense strategy into territorial defense strategy, where instead of staying in a fort, the cavalry and artillery were placed on a more open area at the periphery. Barracks were built around the city, such as the barracks for the cavalries in Kestalan and the barracks for the artillery soldiers in Stabelan. Another military strategy introduced by Daendels was the construction of roads to enable mobility for the soldiers. Strategic points in the city were connected with new roads: the road in front of Fort Vastenburg connected it with the forts in Kartasura, Boyolali, Salatiga, Ungaran and Semarang. The resident's house was moved out of the fort, although still in close proximity. The Europeans did not stay in the fort any longer, but around the fort, forming a new European styled community complete with its facility such as Societeit. This European settlement can still be seen especially around the vicinity of Fort Vastenburg. During the Japanese Occupation period, Fort Vastenburg was used by the Bala Dai Nippon army. After the independence of Indonesia, Fort Vastenburg was used by the National Army to maintain independence. From 1970s to 1980s Fort Vastenburg was used as a training ground for the Army Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad), which acted as the RI Defense and Security Agency. Buildings inside the site were divided into residences for the member of the army and their family. From this time, the fort fell into disrepair. This is kept this way until 1986. Issue of multiple owners There are several attempts of reusing the land around the fort. In November 2008, one of the owner of the fort decided to build a thirteen floored hotel and a shopping mall on top of the fort. This caused protests from the public. As of 2015, a new Bank building owned by Danamon has been set up to the west of the fort. Several attempts have been made by the city government of Surakarta to take over the fort for public use. The Fort was named a cultural site protected in bylaw No. 1/2012 on Cultural Preservation. The city also created a bylaw, precluding seven of the land owners of Fort Vastenburg from extending their land use permits. The other two holders had extended the land permit use until 2032. Various events have been held in Fort Vastenburg since 2013, such as the Solo Carnival, Grand Gamelan Concert, Solo City Jazz Festival, Solo International Performing Arts, Solo Culinary Festival, Imlek Festival, Solo 24-hour Dance and Solo Kampoeng Arts.

While algebra systems with graphical user interfaces focus on prototyping of algorithms, implementation of such algorithms into distribution-ready applications is done using development environments and general purpose programming languages (GPL). ILNumerics is an extension to Visual Studio and aims at supporting the creation of technical applications based on .NET. History ILNumerics started in 2006 as an open source project, originating from the Technical University of Berlin. In 2007 ILNumerics won the BASTA! Innovation Awards 2007BASTA! Innovation Award 2007 as most innovative .NET project in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. After 6 years of open source development, the project added a closed source, proprietary license in 2011, aiming business and academic developers at the same time. The project quickly gained popularity (download numbers and engagement at stackoverflow.com, download counts from website not available). The .NET framework was selected as a managed foundation, since earlier attempts on the Java platform had been abandoned due to technical limitations. Similarly, the .NET framework has not been designed with the focus on requirements of technical application development. ILNumerics added interfaces to popular codes (LAPACK, FFTW), complex numbers and generic mult-dimensional array classes. In 2010 graphical capabilities have been added. Efforts to increase the performance of the technology were introduced in 2011. At the same time, a company was founded to continue the development. The technological goal is to establish the .NET framework as a feasible alternative to unmanaged languages for numeric computing. Syntax ILNumerics implements base functionality frequently needed for application development in technical areas: N-dimensional arrays, complex numbers, linear algebra, FFT and plotting controls (2D and 3D). The array classes are fully compatible with the array features of Matlab(R) and numpy, including internal storage order, subarray creation, expansion, and advanced indexing. Higher level functionality is provided by toolboxes for interpolation, optimization, statistics, HDF5 and machine learning. The ILNumerics DSL is embedded into .NET. Computational algorithms are formulated using any CLI language. However, only C# and Visual Basic are officially supported. Due to the strong type system of the .NET framework algorithms created with ILNumerics are strongly typed. This deviates from the syntax of alternatives, which are often weakly typed and therefore easier to adopt. Graphics A scene graph is used in ILNumerics to realize graphical output. Interactive 2D and 3D plots are used in Windows Forms applications. Hardware accelerated drawing is available via OpenGL. A software renderer is provided for legacy hardware, based on GDI+ and SVG. IDE integration ILNumerics is distributed as an extension to Visual Studio. It adds a tool window to the IDE for the graphical inspection of mathematical objects while stepping through user code. Performance Since ILNumerics comes as a CLI assembly, it targets Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) applications. Just like Java - those frameworks are often criticized for not being suitable for numerical computations. Reasons are the memory management by a garbage collector, the intermediate language execution and deficient optimizations by the compilers involved. ILNumerics approaches these limitations by performing loop unrolling, removal of bound checks on array accesses and cache optimizations. Further speed-up is gained by the auto- management of the memory of large array objects. Numerical operations are parallelized on multicore systems. Linear algebra routines rely on processor specific optimized versions of LAPACK and BLAS. ILNumerics arrays utilize the unmanaged heap for storing data. This way, the size of ILNumerics arrays is not limited by the CLR and interoperability with 3rd party libraries is improved.

Life Harris was born in 1783 in Whitwell, Rutland, to rector Hamlyn Harris and Elizabeth Harris.Northamptonshire, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1532-1812 Educated at Uppingham School, in 1801 he enlisted as an ensign in the 87th Regiment of Foot. He became a Lieutenant in the 52nd Regiment of Foot in 1802 and purchased a captaincy in the 18th Light Dragoons in 1807 before retiring through ill health having been refused a transfer to half-pay. In 1811 he joined the 13th Light Dragoons as a cornet, was promoted to a lieutenancy in the 18th Hussars and afterwards served in the Peninsular War from 1811-1813 as deputy assistant adjutant general attached to headquarters. From Spain he was sent to Germany where he served as aide-de- camp to Sir Charles Stewart (later Sir Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry). He was present at the battles of Grossbergen, Dennewitz and Leipzig in October 1813. In his later narrative of the war Vane noted the gallantry displayed by Harris and his \\"efficient assistance\\". After the Battle of Leipzig he was presented with a fine sword by merchant and adventurer Edward Solly inscribed with the legend From Edward Solly To Thomas Noel Harris, In Commemoration Of Their Fellowship At The Memorable Battle Of Leipzig Of The 18th And 19th Of October 1813. In 2015, the sword was sold for ¬£43,750 at a Bonham's auction. From late 1813 until early 1814, Harris was attached to the staff of the Prussian General Bl√ºcher and at the end of his service received a gold ring and the feathers from Bl√ºcher's hat as a token of the latter's esteem. On 30March 1814, following the capitulation of Paris, Harris was sent to London by Stewart bearing dispatches with the news. He made the journey without rest while fending off attacks by supposedly friendly troops. He was taken to Carlton House to deliver dispatches to the Prince Regent. In April 1815 he was appointed Brigade-Major to the 18th Hussars under Major-general Sir Hussey Vivian. On 15June he attended the Duchess of Richmond's ball in Brussels. On receiving the order to join units, Harris left immediately in his red swallow-tailed court dress coat, which he subsequently wore at the battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo. He spent the eve of Waterloo with his cousin Lieutenant Colonel Clement Wallington of the 10th Hussars. During the subsequent battle he had two horses shot from under him, but while charging in advance of one of the squadrons in his brigade his right arm was shattered by a musket ball. He was carried to the farmhouse of Hougoumont where his arm was amputated and was subsequently cared for by Wallington who took him to Brussels. In October 1815 Harris returned to France and carried with him four swords voted by the Corporation of London for the commanders of the four allied armies. Harris became a lieutenant-colonel in 1823 and was appointed Inspecting Field-Officer of Militia in Nova Scotia and then Surveyor-General at Halifax. In 1830 he retired on half-pay. On his return he was appointed Assistant Adjutant-General in Dublin. He retired from the army in September 1834 and became Chief Magistrate in Gibraltar. Awards He was rewarded for his military service with a knighthood from Queen Victoria and the Prussian Order of Military Merit, the Russian Orders of St. Anna and St. Vladimir as well as made a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order and a Groom of Her Majesty's Most Hon.

The corps was established near Kiev.  History  Formation of the corps began in spring 1941 in the Odessa Military District, with headquarters and the main part of the corps at Pervomaysk and the 212th Airborne Brigade at Voznesensk. In the first half of August 1941 the corps fought as infantry in the Battle of Kiev and suffered heavy losses.Thompson, Unfulfilled Promise: The Soviet Airborne Forces 1928-45 On 29 August, its commander, Vasili Glazunov, was appointed commander of the Soviet airborne. At the beginning of September, it fought in the defense of Konotop. In November 1941, the corps was reorganized as the 87th Rifle Division (second formation), under Colonel Alexander Rodimtsev, former commander of the 5th Airborne Brigade. The 87th Rifle Division joined the 40th Army. On December 4 the Germans broke through the defensive front of the 40th Army, and building on the success in the north-east, occupied Prilepa and several other localities. The division was tasked to close the breach. On the morning of December 8 the enemy resumed the offensive on the Kursk-Kastornoye direction. The commander of the 40th army set the division the task to provide cover in the occupied positions, regroup and come out on foot to the area Serebryanka-Tretyakov-Athanasian to stop the fight in the counter offensive of the Germans. Then she had to, in cooperation with other parts to crush in settlements Leninsky and transhipments opposing enemy force and immediately capture the city and Cheremisinovo Shchigry. After 40 km, the division was able to focus in a given area only in the evening on 10 December. The morning of 11 December, she attacked the German positions and captured two villages. On 22 December, the division attacked in conjunction with the 1st Guards Rifle Division and 2nd Guards Rifle Division and captured Marmyzhi. On 24 December, elements of the 87th fought in the villages of Inanovka Pozhidaevka and Krasnaya Polyana. By the end of 27 December, the division was in the area of the villages of Plahovka, Golovinovka and Petrovka. In the first half of January 1942, the division conducted defensive operations in the area. On 16 January, the German troops attacked but were unable to break through. On 18 January, the division attacked in the direction of Kryukovo-Rusakova and to capture the eastern outskirts of Shchigry. The division was ordered to be converted into the 13th Guards Rifle Division on 19 January for its actions during these battles. The new numbering was officially awarded on 4 March 1942.

Film shot in the style of historical tragicomedy. Plot A hussars regiment fumes to the provincial town of Gubernsk for summer maneuvers. Frivolous life outside the barracks, away from the metropolitan authorities, evening shows in the theater, billiard, card game, flirting with the ladies - this is the hussars' lives in the provincial town. But soon the regiment gets into trouble. From St. Petersburg, on the personal orders of the emperor, with a special mission, arrives count Merzlyaev. Some officers of the regiment are suspected of \\"free-thinking\\" and of conspiring against the government. Merzlyaev offers these officers a test: they must shoot a rebel, thus demonstrating their loyalty to the emperor. Merzlyaev's cunning plan is that the \\"execution by shooting\\" is false: the cartridges are blank, and the role of \\"the condemned conspirator\\" will be played by a stranger. If the officers refuse to shoot - they face the military court and penal servitude. On the role of the \\"conspirator\\" Merzlyaev hires Bubentsov, an actor who is in jail for a stupid carelessness. Merzlyaev's \\"play\\" goes perfectly, but suddenly it is interfered by human dignity. Cornet Alexei Pletnev (one of the officers who should play the role of the executioners), let the \\"rebel\\" Bubentsov go free. And it's starting to turn tragic ... Trying to save his plan and his reputation, count Merzlyaev is ready to take any action, to create any abomination. But he is unable to defeat love and generosity of honest people...

This composer repeatedly worked with Eldar Ryazanov. The songs in the film were written on poems of famous poets of different times: Denis Davydov, Pyotr Vyazemsky, Mikhail Savoyarov, Marina Tsvetaeva, Mikhail Arkadyevich Svetlov. Later, a disc was released, which was recorded with the participation of the USSR State Committee for Cinematography Orchestra (conductor Sergei Skripka) and State Wind Orchestra of the RSFSR. Filming scandal The film proved to be an ordeal for Eldar Ryazanov. The screenplay was written in the summer and autumn of 1978. The State Committee for Cinematography of the USSR did not accept the script, and Eldar Ryazanov brought it to Central Television of the USSR. After a long bureaucratic process the script was adopted into production by Studio Ekran. In autumn 1979 the movie was put into production in the cinematic studio Mosfilm. But soon came the decision that stunned Ryazanov - to shut down the film. In December 1979, Soviet troops entered Afghanistan and the Soviet censors saw the script of the film as a kind of \\"sedition\\". Initially, according to the creators, Merzlyaev was a Gendarme officer, but then, at the insistence of the TV authorities, any mention of that Russian \\"law enforcement agency\\" should be excluded from the screenplay. Screenplay authors Ryazanov and Gorin were surprised - \\"Soviet power\\" that toppled down \\"damned tsarism\\" in 1917, in 1979 struggled to protect one of the most hideous manifestations of \\"tsar's power\\" - \\"political police\\" represented in the movie by Gendarmes. Despite all his attempts to change the decision of TV authorities, Ryazanov could not do anything. Then Ryazanov and Gorin made a decision to rewrite the script. The general meaning of the film was immediately distorted, the story developed numerous inconsistencies and logical absurdities. Merzlyaev became an indistinct official with special assignments. To emphasize his involvement in the secret services, he was awarded the rank of Actual Privy Councilor. Such rank, equal to that of the general, in the Russian Empire, could be held only by high-ranking officials of the ministerial level. It looked unlikely that an official of such rank would personally come to a provincial town and get engaged in petty intrigues. Total control and censorship continued in the course of the filming. In his autobiography Ryazanov tells of flagrant cases of such intervention. For example, in one of the humorous episodes, actor Bubentsov (played by Yevgeny Leonov) was supposed to quote the famous poem by Lermontov: \\"Farewell, unwashed Russia!\\". TV bosses noticed the lines: \\"... And you, blue uniforms, and you, people faithful to them\\" and considered them as \\"seditious\\" hints at the Gendarmes. They ordered a replacement for the poem. Enraged Ryazanov, in vain, shouted in the face of the censors, that this Lermontov's poem is not an illegal literature and is learned by heart in every Soviet school. In the final version the actor Bubentsov quoted Pushkin's poem: \\"I sit behind bars in a damp prison ...\\" Ryazanov, wrote in his book: Working over the film \\"Say a Word for the Poor Hussar\\" was not only a test for professionalism, it was a test for integrity, honesty and generosity. The content of the movie corresponded to our lives, to our work. The provocations, intrigues, infamies, that were described in our scenario, we had tested on ourselves while shooting the movie. Every scene that was planned to be shot tomorrow, as a rule, was remodel, refined, and appended the day before, which also increased the chaos and confusion on the film set. Perhaps \\"Say a Word for the Poor Hussar\\" was my most difficult work. Blows rained down on from all sides, from within and without. –≠–ª—å–¥–∞—Ä –†—è–∑–∞–Ω–æ–≤ ¬´–ó–∞—ç–∫—Ä–∞–Ω—å–µ¬ª –í–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è References External links * 1981 films 1981 comedy films Soviet black-and-white films Mosfilm films Russian-language films Films directed by Eldar Ryazanov Soviet comedy films Soviet films Russian comedy films Russian films ","title":"Say a Word for the Poor Hussar"},{"id":"48629003","text":"Nicole Pollard is a fashion stylist and entrepreneur living in Santa Monica.

Hallam was a traditional Unionist seat that nearly went Liberal in 1906. It remained a marginal in both 1910 General Elections before being the vehicle that propelled Liberal H. A. L. Fisher into parliament as a supporter of the Lloyd George coalition. In 1918 Fisher chose not to defend this seat and a coalition supporting Unionist was returned unopposed. By the 1922 election, the Coalition Government had ended and in Hallam, the party political battle between Unionist and Liberal was resumed after 12 years. However, Rewcastle was only able to capture around 40% of the vote. In 1923 another general election was fought, primarily on the issue of free trade v tariffs. Rewcastle might have fancied his prospects of winning, however a Labour Party candidate intervened and split the anti-tariff vote, pushing Rewcastle into third place. He did not contest the 1924 general election.British parliamentary election results 1885‚Äì1949, Craig, F.W.S.

He was born and died at Coventry, now in West Midlands but formerly in Warwickshire. Venn was prominent as a right-handed batsman in Coventry district club cricket before the First World War, playing for the Foleshill Victoria club, and also appeared in second eleven matches for Warwickshire. He did not at this stage play first-class cricket, but in 1919, he turned out for a \\"full\\" Warwickshire side ‚Äì composed mainly of amateurs ‚Äì in a first-class non-County Championship game against Worcestershire and, opening the batting, scored 151. In the return match a few weeks later, his 58 in his only innings was the top score of the game. That appears to have encouraged Venn to give a whole season to first-class cricket and he was a regular opening batsman for the first three months of the 1920 season. Initially, he was quite successful, and against Kent at Catford he made 115 out of Warwickshire's total of 233, his second and final first-class century. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted: \\"Strong in defence with a stiff fore-arm forcing stroke, Venn got most of his runs in front of the wicket. He played-on after two and a half hours' batting, having scored 115 out of 222.\\" Venn did not pass 50 in any other innings that season, and his record for the season as a whole was modest, with 591 runs at an average of 16.41 runs per innings. Venn returned to Warwickshire for a few early matches in the 1921 season, but was not successful; he then played three times in 1922 and once in 1925, again without making much impact.

The Botanical Garden and Zoo is one of the principal open spaces of the city of Asunci√≥n, set in natural forest covering to the north of the city. The zoo is home to nearly seventy species of wildlife including birds, mammals and reptiles, mostly representing the fauna of South America. The botanical garden is home to native species, exhibiting in particular the variety and beauty of its lush trees. History This sprawling property was the former country house and estate of Carlos Antonio Lopez, president of Paraguay between 1842 and 1862. Lopez ordered the construction of \\"Casa Lopez\\" as his home in the 1840s. Besides its historical value, the main building is very representative of the era in which it was built, in terms of technology, architecture and decoration, and is registered in the \\"Catalogue of Buildings and Sites of Urban Planning, architectural , Historical and Artistic Heritage of the city of Asunci√≥n\\",and specially protected by Law 946/82 \\"Protection of Cultural Property\\". In 1896, Lopez's descendants sold the estate to the Agricultural Bank, by then in state ownership. The garden was created as such in 1914 by German scientists Karl Freibig and his wife, Anna Gertz. Fiebrig was professor of botany and zoology at the University of Asunci√≥n, having settled in Paraguay in 1910 following plant and insect collecting trips to Paraguay for European museums between 1904 and 1909. Fiebrig founded a school of Agriculture in 1916. Fiebrig also founded a \\"Cotton Institute\\" which helped fund the garden complex. The zoo was subsequently established by the same scientists, with a very advanced approach for the time, housing the animals in a setting as close as possible to their natural habitat. Gertz is credited with much of the landscape design of the gardens, though some projects were truncated following her death in May 1920. She was buried in the gardens. Fiebrig continued as director of the garden and zoo, and remarried in 1925. In addition to his professorship, in 1934, was also made director of the Paraguayan Department of Agriculture. In 1936, in the aftermath of the Chaco War, a wave of xenophobic sentiment forced Fiebrig to leave Paraguay with his second wife and family. Responsibility for the estate passed from the state to its present owner, the Municipality of Asunci√≥n. Historically, the estate covered more than , and had over 1 km frontage along the bank of the Paraguay River, a port, a railway station and 60 km of road network. In the last 50 years, there have been several incursions, such as the riverside (ESSAP) Vi√±as Cu√© water treatment plant, the Copaco transmission station (built at the time of dictator Stroessner), the Asunci√≥n Golf Club, laid out by Fiebrig, and several other divisions due to illegal occupations. Since 2013 the garden and zoo's director has been Maris Llorens. Facilities and collections The facilities include: * Botanical Garden: Originally called a botanical garden just because of the exuberant natural flora. Its trees are now over 150 years old and provide visitors with welcome shade. * Nursery: cultivating more than 500 species of plants, many of them medical, used for educational interpretation about the properties of herbs. * Zoo: It has about 64 species of animals, mammals, birds, reptiles and others. Its iconic exhibit is the Tagua, a species of peccary that inhabits the Paraguayan Chaco, initially believed extinct, which was rediscovered in the 1980s. * Natural History Museum: located in a former farmhouse of Carlos Antonio Lopez's estate. * Golf: For 50 years, the municipality of Asunci√≥n has ceded part of its space to various institutions, one of them being Asunci√≥n Golf Club. Whilst still part of the Botanical Garden premises, it is managed completely independently. Botanical Garden and Nursery The nursery is located behind the Upper House and contains over 500 species specialising in medicinal plants. It is open to the public and works in cooperation with the Botanic Garden and Conservatory of the City of Geneva, Switzerland. Established for over 10 years, it has undertaken investigations into the cultivation, distribution and introduction of plants, specifically native, but also medicinal plants introduced by Paraguayan settlers. The work of the Conservatory is to preserve the culture of the knowledge of medicinal plants in Paraguay. \\"The Paraguayan people consume herbs and know the use of at least 50 species.

History Construction on the two-story mansion began in 1831, and it was completed in 1837. It was built for John Smiser, a lawyer from Hagerstown, Maryland who practised the law in Natchez, Mississippi and served as the sheriff of Williamson County, Tennessee, and his wife, Mary Evie Turtey, a native of Paris, Kentucky. After the Smisers died and were buried on the property in 1840, the mansion was inherited by their daughter Ellen and her husband, James Gray Booker, the son of large planter Peter R. Booker, Sr. (1784-1839). By 1853, Booker's brother-in-law and his four daughters, who had died of yellow fever in New Orleans, Louisiana, were buried on the property. The mansion was acquired by Lex Watson (1892-1951) in 1931. It was later repurposed as a retirement facility, until it became a private residence once again. Architectural significance The mansion was designed by architect Nathan Vaught in the Greek Revival architectural style.

It was founded in 1998 by Imran and Rizwana Hussain in Bradford and it is known for manufacturing Home Care products, Personal Care products and Beverages and high performance LED bulbs. The company currently exports its products in more than 100 countries, thus covering extended areas of EU, the Middle East, Asia, USA, and the Southern Hemisphere.  History  1990‚Äì2001 In 1998, Multibrands is incorporated as a wholesale supply business trading in locally sourced global brands. In 1999, Multibrands sources the first container of grey market brands from Asia. Within the same year, it launches its first home product - EasyLite and Spark lighters. In 2000, Multibrands opens up imports from India and the Middle East. One year later, it opens trade links in the South American, African and Russian markets. 2002‚Äì2012 By importing branded goods on the grey market, Multibrands purchases the products at the best price and then redistributes them at more competitive prices in the United Kingdom. By 2002, Multibrands is declared the largest parallel goods trader in the UK. In 2003, PZ Cussons objects to this practice of parallel trading and takes court action against Multibrands to stop them from importing and selling the Cussons brand of Imperial Leather soap at cheaper prices. Cussons wins the case and this way seizes 230,000 bars of soap from Multibrands premises. The ruling is later criticised by the consumers association who call for an end to the practice of price fixing by manufactures and suggest that EU markets should be opened up for fair and more competitive trade to end the Rip-Off Britain culture. Later in 2003, Multibrands faces up to the challenge of no longer being able to parallel trade and totally restructures the company, developing its own brand of FMCG products. In 2004, the company therefore launches a new product - Ultraloc super glue. Further products follow, as in 2005 Multibrands goes on and introduces Supacell batteries, Essence feminine hygiene products, Tushies baby wipes and Fluorodine toothpaste. In 2006, the company registers its first global export. In 2007, Multibrands starts publishing the Brand News brochure with monthly circulation in excess of 250,000. That same year, Supacell rechargeable batteries are created, using the highest standards in manufacturing. In 2008, their catalogue gains three new products: Duraplast Adhesive bandage, Unity condoms and Lipice lip balm. As the business is constantly growing, the company starts doing telesales in India with over 50 employees who deal directly with UK independent stores and the pharmacy sector. That same year, Hunnies and Tushies baby wipes are launched on the market. In 2009, the company redevelops Spark lighters and extends the Fluorodine range with a set of toothbrushes and mouthwash. In the following year, Multibrands opens a new global base, office and warehouse in Suzhou, China. In 2010, additional new products are created: U-Stick adhesive stick and U-Tac reusable putty. In 2011, a new global base opens in Pune, India, in order to serve the Head Office for numerous administrative functions and at the same time, enabling it to undertake a much bigger and more efficient level of international trade. That same year, a new generation of Duraplast plasters is created. In order to become more sales efficient, Multibrands‚Äô online shop becomes available in 2012. 2013‚Äì2016 In June 2014, Imran Hussain purchases Royds Hall, an 800 years old manor, thus setting the steps for a new Multibrands venture. When faced with replacing all the old incandescent light bulbs with LED ones in the manor, Imran soon realizes that most brands on the market are either too cheap and low end, or far too expensive. When this added up to the far too complicated packaging, which made it difficult to choose the right cap and shape needs, Imran had his own light bulb moment. Originating from the lamps and lighting industry, he starts researching in order to develop a new LED light bulbs brand that would meet the consumers‚Äô actual needs. Therefore, in late 2015, Multibrands launches Supacell LED, their own complete range of LED light bulbs. Supacell LED is developed using A+ Smart LED technology, which ensures up to 90% energy savings. The range is showcased from this point on at every major international trade show: the Spring Fair (February 2016) and the Autumn Fair (September 2016) at the NEC Birmingham, LED Expo India, Hong Kong International Fair (April 2016) and Light Middle East in Dubai (November 2016). The brand also becomes a sponsor for various bloggers at social media events. The products start being retailed online, on platforms such as eBay, Online Pound Store and International lamps, followed by major retailers, such as Poundland. Environmental record All Multibrands factories operate ISO 14001 Environmental Management System. All products use recyclable paper and/or biodegradable plastics. They are transported responsibly by using lower emission vehicles. Social responsibility Legal Structure Multibrands operate an independently audited Quality Management System which complies with the requirements of ISO9001:2015. A variety of other business practices are also submitted to independent, external audit and certification authorities such as Investors in People, SGS, FDA as evidence of Multibrands commitment to quality.

The unique characteristic of FluidFM is that it introduces microscopic channels into AFM probes. Those channels can have an aperture of less than 300 nm, or 500 times thinner than a human hair. This nanometric features enables the handling of liquid volumes at the femtoliter (fL) scale as well as force controlled manipulations of sub-micron objects. Via the nanofluidic channels, substances can for example be inserted into single cells or cells can be isolated from a confluent layer. Technology Special micropipettes and nanopipettes are used as FluidFM probes with openings between 300 nm and 8 Œºm. A larger diameter is helpful for single cell adhesion experiments, whereas a smaller diameter provides good opportunities for nanolithography and handling of sub- micron objects. Compared to the traditional glass micropipettes FluidFM probes are much more gentle to soft samples such as cells. They can be controlled with pN and nm precision, and handle volumes more precise and consistent due to their wafer-based fabrication process. FluidFM has unique advantages for single cell applications and beyond. To control volumes in the fL range FluidFM relies on pressure control. Either overpressure or vacuum is used, depending of the application. Typical operating pressures are in the range of a few hPa. The FluidFM technology is typically used on top of an inverted microscope. In addition to standard AFM experiments, FluidFM provides the possibility to perform countless other applications, such as single cell injection and adhesion as well as nanolithography and spotting.  Applications  Single cell injection is an important tool for life sciences, biology and medicine. To perform single cell injection experiments, the probe pierces the cell and a substance can be injected. With FluidFM the success rate is almost 100%, in contrast to other methods, because the probes are small, sharp and force sensitive.2013\\\\. O. Guillaume - Gentil, E. Potthoff, D. Ossola, P.

With FluidFM it is possible to increase the rate in which these experiments can be performed, and even to assess the adhesion of spread cells. The cell of interest is reversibly attached to the probe by applying an underpressure. By raising the probe, the force of the adhesion can be measured with pN resolution.2014\\\\. E. Potthoff, D.

Colloidal experiments give the opportunity to measure interaction forces between colloidal particles and surfaces as well as the local elasticity of complex substrates. The rate in which these experiments can be performed is rather low because normally colloids have to be pre-glued on an AFM probe. In contrast, the colloid probes can be reversibly attached to the FluidFM probe by underpressure. Therefore, one probe can be used for many experiments and many colloids.2015\\\\. B. R. Simona, L.

It was constructed to guard a trade route in central Java. The fort is the place where Prince Diponegoro was imprisoned while waiting for his judgment in Batavia and further exile to Makassar. The fort is currently used as a dormitory for the families of Indonesian police personnel. Description Fort Willem II is a small square- shaped fort with four bastions, located in the center of Ungaran, on the Semarang-Surakarta road. The building of the Regional People's Representative Assembly (DPRD) is located just in front of the fort. A moat used to surround the fort until the 19th century, when it was filled in. A one meter thick wall surrounds the fort. A two-floored building provide a vantage point at the western main entrance point and the eastern back entrance point. The buildings inside the fort surround an inner courtyard. History Fort Willem II is a relatively old fortress in Java. There are differing opinions regarding the fort's completion. The fort was built by the Dutch in 1786 to maintain peace along a trade route in Central Java as one of the series of Dutch forts which include Fort Herstelling in Salatiga and Fort Veldwachter in Boyolali. The fort was originally named Fort de Ontmoeting (\\"the meeting\\") to commemorate the historic meeting between Pakubuwono II, the first Susuhunan (ruler) of Surakarta, and Gustaaf van Imhoff, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, on May 11, 1746, at which the transfer of the capital of the Mataram Sultanate from Kartosuro to Surakarta was agreed. Some sources claim that the fort was built in 1712. Others that the fort was constructed between 1740 and 1742 during a chaotic period in Java; with Baron van Imhoff being hospitalized in the fort after an attack by a force from Surakarta in 1742. Between 1800 and 1807 Fort Willem II was controlled by the Batavian Republic; from 1807 until 1811 French soldiers took over the fort. The British army occupied the fort from 1811 until 1816, when it was handed back to the Dutch. In 1826, during the Java War, the fort was attacked from the direction of Rembang by troops of Prince Diponegoro, led by Kyai Mojo, Diponegoro's religious advisor and military commander. The fort almost fell to Kyai Mojo after being surrounded for two weeks, but it held out until Kyai Mojo withdrew. When the war ended in 1830, Diponegoro was captured and imprisoned inside Fort Willem II for three days in August 1830 before being transferred to Batavia to be tried. In 1849, the fort was captured by the British without resistance. The British used the fort into a hospital, until it was returned to the Dutch. The Dutch used the fort as a military camp between 1918 and 1919. During the Japanese occupation period of 1942 to 1945, the fort was used as prison. It was reoccupied by the Dutch in 1945 and used as a police barracks until 1950. In 1951, after Indonesian independence, it was briefly used by the Indonesian National Armed Forces before it is transferred to the police to be used as dormitory. In 2007, the Semarang Regency decided to convert the fort into a museum, and in 2011 the it was renovated in preparation for the conversion. However, land ownership disputes caused problems and the restoration was cancelled. The fort is currently used as a dormitory for the families of 16 members of the police department.

The British Chinese Workforce Heritage project was written about in the South China Morning Post.  British Chinese Food Culture  Funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the British Chinese Food Culture (Ëã±Âúã‰∏≠È§êÊñáÂåñ) project was launched in 2011 in order to identify the changes in British Chinese Cuisine from the original recipes derived from Greater China. A key focus is how the availability of ingredients caused Chinese restaurants to adapt their dishes and explores how the reintroduction of original ingredients allows restaurants to deliver greater authenticity.  Healthy Chinese Cuisine Ambassadors  From 2016 the new GCSE in Food Preparation & Nutrition will be taught in British schools. In preparation the Ming-Ai (London) Institute in partnership with Chinese manufacturer Lee Kum Kee founded a project to promote Chinese cuisine in British schools. The project will last for five years with the objective of reaching 280 schools and conduct 40 or more teacher training workshops.  East West Festive Culture  Funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, East West Festive Culture (Êù±Ë•øÊñáÂåñÁØÄÊÖ∂) was a two-year project which started in October 2008.

Firstly Chinese people who emigrated to the UK in their early life, secondly couples with a non-Chinese partner and finally British born Chinese. Each of these groups was selected to shed light to both the contrast and similarities between Eastern and Western culture.  The Evolution and History of British Chinese Workforce  In October 2009 the Ming-Ai (London) Institution used funding from UK Government Transformation Fund to undertake The Evolution and History of British Chinese Workforce (Ëã±ÂúãËèØ‰∫∫ËÅ∑Ê•≠ÊºîËÆäÂè≤) project. This was the second oral histories project undertaken by the Ming-Ai (London) Institute.  Making Chinese Votes Count  Funded by the Electoral Commission the Making Chinese Votes Count project was managed by a consortium consisting of both the Ming-Ai (London) Institute and the London Chinese Community Network (LCCN). The 12-month project started in January 2006 with provision to improve the representation of Chinese people in the UK Government. Within the project a series of community workshops were delivered covering topics such as electoral law, political participation, how to become involved in politics. Around 180 people of which 56% of whom were of Chinese descent attended a series of four workshops through the course of the project.  Associate College of Middlesex University  In 1995 the institution joined resources with Middlesex University to develop a number of China-related courses. The Ming-Ai (London) Institute delivers postgraduate courses in Chinese Cultural Heritage Management leading to either MA, PG Dip and PG Cert qualification which are awarded by Middlesex University. The Ming-Ai (London) Institute also facilitated negotiations between Middlesex University and Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and Pharmacology leading to the establishment in 1997 of their joint five-year Degree programme, B.Sc. (Hons) in Traditional Chinese Medicine for which the Ming-Ai (London) Institute provides Mandarin training for the programme.  Domestic activities  The institute has established relationships with many UK institutions and community groups with whom the Ming-Ai (London) Institute has collaborated in joint ventures toward the aim of forging closer ties Greater China, British Chinese communities and the rest of Great Britain.  Network of UK Higher Education Institutions  Links with UK Institutions of higher education have allowed the institute to recruit on China's behalf, UK graduates to teach overseas. Furthermore, the institute has helped UK institutions to recruit students from across Greater China by giving lecturers an opportunity to teach in Chinese institutions.

Translated into 18 languages, the book helped foster the postmodernism art movement. Compilation In March 1968, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown wrote and published ‚ÄúA Significance for A&P; Parking Lots, or Learning from Las Vegas‚Äù (Architectural Forum, March 1968). That following fall, the two created a research studio for graduate students at Yale School of Art and Architecture. The studio was called \\"Learning from Las Vegas, or Form Analysis as Design Research\\".Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, Steven Izenour, Learning from Las Vegas, MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 1972, revised 1977. Izenour, a graduate student in the studio, accompanied his senior tutor colleagues, Venturi and Scott Brown, to Las Vegas in 1968 together with nine students of architecture and four planning and graphics students to study the urban form of the city. Las Vegas was regarded as a \\"non-city\\" and as an outgrowth of a \\"strip\\", along which were placed parking lots and singular frontages for gambling casinos, hotels, churches and bars. The research group studied various aspects of the city, including the commercial vernacular, lighting, patterns, styles, and symbolism in the architecture. Venturi and Scott Brown created a taxonomy for the forms, signs, and symbols they encountered. The two were inspired by the emphasis on sign and symbol they found on the Las Vegas strip. The result was a critique of Modern architecture, demonstrated most famously in the comparison between the \\"duck\\" and \\"decorated shed.\\" The \\"duck\\" represents a large part of modernist architecture, which was expressive in form and volume. In contrast, the \\"decorated shed\\" relies on imagery and sign. Virtually all architecture before the Modern Movement used decoration to convey meaning, often profound but sometimes simply perfunctory, such as the signage on medieval shop fronts. Only Modernist architecture eschewed such ornament, relying only on corporeal or structural elements to convey meaning. As such, argued the authors, Modern buildings became mute and vacuous, especially when built for corporate or government clients. Reception Learning from Las Vegas caused a stir in the architectural world upon its publication, as it was hailed by progressive critics for its bold indictment of Modernism, and by the status quo as blasphemous. A split among young American architects occurred during the 1970s, with Izenour, Venturi, Robert A.M. Stern, Charles Moore, and Allan Greenberg defending the book as \\"The Greys\\", and Richard Meier, Peter Eisenman, John Hejduk, and Michael Graves writing against its premises as \\"The Whites.\\" It became associated with post-modernism when magazines such as Progressive Architecture published articles citing its influence on the younger generation. Tom Wolfe's often-pilloried book, From Bauhaus to Our House, praises Venturi, Scott Brown, and Izenour for their stand against heroic Modernism. Exhibition From October 29, 2009 to February 5, 2010, \\"What We Learned: The Yale Las Vegas Studio\\" and \\"The Work of Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates\\" were exhibited at the Yale School of Architecture gallery, with approximately 100 photographs from Las Vegas taken during the October 1968 trip that would underpin the research by Mr. Venturi and Ms. Scott Brown. The exhibitions were accompanied by an informational leaflet and interview. \\"What We Learned\\" originated at the (Kriens, Switzerland) and had been exhibited at the Deutsches Architekturmuseum in Frankfurt, Germany. Publication history The authors felt the original 1972 edition was \\"too monumental for a text that praised the ugly and ordinary over the heroic and monumental\\" and offered a revised edition, later published as a more modest paperback in 1977. The original 1972 large-format edition was designed by Muriel Cooper for MIT Press and became a design icon in its own right after it fell out of print. In 2017, MIT Press began offering a facsimile edition of the 1972 original with a preface by Denise Scott Brown explaining the reservations the authors had with the original edition. The cost of the first edition was also cited as a reason to allow Mr. Venturi and Ms. Scott Brown to redesign the book.  192 pp.; hc, * 192 pp.; pb, * 216 pp.; hc, References  Further reading    * Architecture books ","title":"Learning from Las Vegas"},{"id":"48629341","text":"Mission Road Ground or Tin Kwong Road Recreation Ground is a multi-purpose sports field in Mong Kok, Hong Kong, which is mainly used for cricket matches.

Guadeloupe's work can be described as a scholarship of possibilities seeking to undo the guiding fictions of \\"race\\", sexism, and the naturalization of class hierarchies that have become entrenched in our thinking, behavior, and institutional arrangements. His method is best captured in this axiom translated from a Dutch article published in the journal Sociale Vraagstukken in 2012: > I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do‚Äîthis I > keep on not doing. Let me explain this slowly, I do not do the good I want > to do (creating the good of a raceless society in its historically > constituted terms, so, practically speaking, doing Dutch society's reality > of race differently), but the evil I do not want to do (which is thinking > and doing in terms of race)‚Äîthis I keep on not doing (so not doing race at > all). Guadeloupe's Via Negativa mode of doing anthropology is influenced by his training at the Radboud University in the Netherlands. There under the guidance of Gerrit Huizer, he was introduced to an unorthodox understanding of the link between Liberation Theology and Marxism. In private conversations, Huizer taught Guadeloupe to appreciate Liberation Theology as Marxism decorated with the best of Christian redemptive politics. Conversely, in accordance with a materialist interpretation of Hegel, Marxism was Christianity finally returning to its radical roots. Guadeloupe resolved these contending definitions in Caribbean fashion by radicalizing both traditions. In Guadeloupe's reading, Christianity and Marxism are both products of planetary creolization: the clash of the peoples of the earth leading to agonistic borrowings and transpositions, as such they are cosmopolitan rather than European and Middle Eastern traditions. Marxism and Liberation Theology are common names for the Social Question and the continuous interrogation of Being and Becoming that meet other traditions such as those concerned with racism and patriarchy. All this is connected to Guadeloupe's predilection for the American pragmatist tradition.

Sp√•kenes lies on the Sp√•kenes peninsula, which extends to the middle of the fjord Lyngen. It is on the hill Storbakken, the highest point of Sp√•kenes. Sp√•kenes is located on the border of G√°ivuotna‚ÄìK√•fjord and Nordreisa in Troms county. The nearest village is Djupvik. Sp√•kenes is open to visitors and has two marked paths that present the history of the fort via drawings and fictional accounts based on real-life situations.  Background  When World War II broke out, the German navy wanted to establish naval bases in Europe to give protection to its fleet. Western Norway, with its numerous fjords and a coastline that is thousands of kilometres long, offered a strategically ideal location. By invading Norway, Germany could ensure an uninterrupted supply of iron ore from Sweden for its military industry. However, at this point, Adolf Hitler gave priority to Germany's military campaign in Western Europe. The situation changed when the Soviet Union launched its offensive against Finland on 30 November 1939. From information contained in British navy messages that German forces decrypted, Germany became aware that Allied forces were preparing an operation in Norway under the guise of assistance to Finland. Also, the leader of the Norwegian fascist party, Vidkun Quisling, claimed that the Norwegian government was engaged in clandestine talks aimed at allowing the British forces access to army bases in Norway. Hitler made his final decision after the Altmark Incident, in which the British Royal Navy boarded a German tanker in Norwegian waters to release Allied merchant sailors held as prisoners. The incident convinced Hitler that Norway would fail to remain neutral. As a result, Germany launched its Operation Weser√ºbung, which meant invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940 at 4:15am. The occupation of Norway allowed Germany to ensure the protection of its supply of iron ore from Sweden and to gain numerous naval bases. These proved pivotal when Allied troops sought to provide transport- related military assistance for the Red Army during Operation Barbarossa, Germany's attack on the Soviet Union.  German troops in Djupvik  German troops arrived in Djupvik on the night of 28 August 1940. With the arrival of 2,000‚Äì3,000 men from these forces, the population of the village of Djupvik grew many times larger. This growth had a profound effect on the entire village. Initially, the soldiers stayed in local residents' houses. In addition to building Sp√•kenes, the Germans built a hospital for their soldiers and officers, where locals too were sometimes treated. The Sp√•kenes garrison consisted mainily of were young Germans transferred from Honningsv√•g. Many of them turned 18 only during their posting. In many cases, the soldiers were stationed in Sp√•kenes for just six months.  Construction and armament of the fort   Construction  The Germans started building the bunkers in 1941. The majority of the workers were Soviet prisoners of war, but German prisoners (deserters and others) also worked there. Some 200 to 300 Norwegians, from Olderdalen, Rotsund, and Reisa, worked on the bunkers, carrying sandbags shipped from Skjerv√∏y to the building site from the port. Sp√•kenes consists of four bunker complexes, each of which included a gun, ammunition bunker, trench, and infantry bunker. After the Germans left, one of the bunkers suffered extensive damage in an explosion. A fire in the gunpowder stores is one possible cause.  Artillery  Sp√•kenes housed several guns with a range of up to 23,000 metres. With this range, they were capable of hitting any ship off Lyngstuva, the furthest tip of the Lyngen peninsula. To enable the monitoring of a large portion of the surroundings, the command bunker was equipped with powerful binoculars. The fort never saw battle.  Prison camp  Sp√•kenes also contained a prisoner of war camp. Most of the prisoners were Soviet, Yugoslavian, and Polish. The road to the local cemetery ran through the prison camp, and villagers were able to witness the conditions at the camp first hand. Local residents occasionally smuggled food to the prisoners. A torture chamber and gallows were built near the camp. Fifteen prisoners were executed either by shooting or by hanging.

Electricity consumption was 8.71 TWh. 65% of the primary energy supply consists of biomass energy, used almost exclusively (97%) in the residential sector. Myanmar‚Äôs energy consumption per capita is one of the lowest in Southeast Asia due to the low electrification rate and a widespread poverty. An estimated 65% of the population is not connected to the national grid. Energy consumption is growing rapidly, however, with an average annual growth rate of 3.3% from 2000 to 2007. Most of Myanmar's electricity (74.7%) is produced by hydroelectricity. The rest is from fossil fuels, with gas as the main fuel (20.5%) followed by coal and oil. In 2017, Myanmar had an installed electricity generation capacity of about 5 gigawatts (GW). The country plans to achieve 100% electrification by 2030. The country is targeting 12% of all electricity to be generated from renewable sources by 2025. The total installed capacity of Myanmar at May 2020 is 6034 MW: 3262 MW of hydro power (54%), 2496 MW of natural gas (41%), 120 MW of coal (2%), 116 MW of diesel (2%) and 40 MW of solar (1%). The cost of electricity production was revealed to be 12 kyats per Kwh for government owned hydro power plants, 72 kyats per Kwh for private owned hydropower plants, 150 to 190 kyats for natural gas plants and 195 kyats for solar power plants. The electrification rate in Myanmar is one of the lowest in Asia, at 50% in 2019 December. The electrification rate is especially low in rural villages, which are mainly not connected to the power grid. Wood and biomass are used as a primary source of energy in these areas. Myanmar has abundant energy resources, particularly hydropower and natural gas. In 2013, Myanmar exported 8561 ktoe of natural gas and 144 ktoe of crude oil. The country is one of the five major energy exporters in the region and is the second biggest exporter of natural gas in the Asia Pacific region after Indonesia. According to the World Energy Council, gas reserves are estimated at 244 Mtoe. Oil and coal play a smaller role with reserves estimated at 7 and 1 Mtoe, respectively. The energy sector is considered a strategic industry by the Myanmar government and the petroleum sector is one of the biggest recipients of foreign direct investment.Stokke, Kristian; Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2018) Myanmar: A Political Economy Analysis. Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI). Report commissioned by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Hydropower  Hydropower resources are estimated to be about 40 GW at a capacity factor of 0.40, giving a total yearly hydropower generation capacity of about 140 TWh. Installed hydropower capacity as of 2011 was 1.54 GW with a total generation of 3.9 TWh, there is therefore substantial opportunity for further growth of this energy source. The Shweli 1 hydroelectric power plant, with a capacity of 600 megawatts (MW), started operation in 2008. The Yeywa hydropower plant opened in 2010 with a capacity of 790 MW, the largest in the country. Several other hydropower projects are under construction or planned. Planned major hydropower plants have been designed mainly for export. The Myitsone Dam project, with a capacity of 6,000 MW, is expected to supply 100% of its electricity to China, while the Tasang Dam project with a planned capacity of 7,110 MW is planned to supply 1,500 MW to Thailand.  Solar energy  Myanmar has one solar power plant operating in Minbu, Magway Division. The plant has the capacity to produce 170 MW of electricity. The country plans to build two more solar power plants Mandalay Division, each to have a generation capacity of 150 MW. Energy subsidies for electricity and lacking tax policy, lack of qualified workforce and limited public administration capacity are viewed to be among the main obstacles complicating development of solar energy in Myanmar.Vakulchuk, Roman; Kyaw Kyaw Hlaing; Edward Ziwa Naing; Indra Overland; Beni Suryadi and Sanjayan Velautham (2017).

Wind energy  Myanmar's Department of Renewable Energy and Hydropower Plants is prioritizing the development of solar and wind energy. Rakhine State, Tanintharyi and Ayeyarwaddy regions have been identified as sites with strong wind power potential. However, solar energy potential is higher compared to that of wind energy in Myanmar.

Unlike other Zinstall transfer products, Easy Transfer does not transfer the programs themselves - only their settings and user files. The product is cited as an alternative to the Windows Easy Transfer Wizard, a feature that has been removed from Microsoft Windows 10 standard options.  Operation  Zinstall Easy Transfer transfers the user workspace from one computer to another. The transfer is done over some form of network connection - router, network, direct cable or a wireless connection. In order to initial the transfer, the user should run the software on old and new computers, which then auto-locate each other on the network. The transfer is then initiated on the new computer. The old computer is not changed and nothing is removed from it. Zinstall Easy Transfer allows selective transfer - user is able to select which files and folders, program settings and user profiles are transferred or not. On the other hand, novice users can run the transfer with default settings, transferring the entire user workspace as-is. Easy Transfer supports Windows XP and higher, both on source and on target of the transfer, but its mostly mentioned for its support of Windows 10, which no longer includes Microsoft's Easy Transfer as a built-in feature.

She founded the Department of Geology served as its first chair, and in 1970, designed and oversaw the construction of the geology laboratory. She was recognized as a distinguished lecturer, and then was promoted to associate professor in 1970. In this position, she taught geology, environmental education, landscapes and resources of Alaska, geomorphology, and paleontology, in addition to doing other work expected of a professor including student advising and curriculum development. She worked for UAA for 25 years until her retirement from teaching in 1984. In 1964, she and four others were in the middle of the frozen-over Portage Lake boring holes in the ice to gather sampling data when the Great Alaska earthquake struck. After a harrowing experience finding a way off the ice, which had buckled while the water underneath was churning, she was chosen to lead the Engineering and Geological Evaluation Group, a group of 50 scientists, to assess the areas of damage in Anchorage prior to the start of rebuilding.

The Great Alaska Earthquake was the most powerful earthquake recorded in North America, and the second most powerful to be recorded in history. Hitting Alaska about 5:30 pm on March 27, 1964, the earthquake registered 9.2.Wessells, Stephen M. for the United States Geological Survey. (2014). \\"1964 Quake: The Great Alaska Earthquake.\\" https://www.usgs.gov/media/videos/1964-quake-great-alaska-earthquake. Accessed July 31, 2018. The damage was immense. The tsunami that followed devastated coastal communities from Alaska to northern California. Landslides demolished entire neighborhoods, railroads and highways were destroyed, and major utilities such as gas mains, electrical grids, and phone systems were obliterated. The USGS estimates that 143 people were killed, and thousands were more displaced. Property damages amounted to $2.3B in 2013 dollars. On the day of the earthquake, Schmidt was leading a research team of three University of Alaska Anchorage students and a U.S. Forest Service scientist on Portage Lake, a glacial lake bounded by the Portage Glacier near Anchorage, Alaska. The crew had driven an Arctic Cat snowmobile onto the frozen lake and were drilling holes in the three feet of ice to measure the depth of the water and to study sedimentation processes. They had just finished drilling a borehole near the center of the lake when the earthquake struck. Heather Saucier, a journalist who studied Schmidt's scientific career and who interviewed Mike Mitchell, one of the students on the Portage Lake, reports that Schmidt and the others fought to keep their balance as the water under the ice sloshed back and forth, rocking the ice. The movement of the ice was later measured at five feet. Booming sounds immediately followed the earthquake, which lasted for nearly five minutes, and the team witnesses avalanches on the mountains surrounding the lake. The flying snow reduced visibility to 10 feet. Led by Schmidt, the group attempted to head for the nearest shore on their snowmachine, but fissures in the ice, open water, and the continued rocking prevented them from reaching shore. Eventually, they abandoned the snowmachine and began to walk in a different direction to get off the ice, tied together by a rope in case one of them slipped into a fissure in the ice. Once they made their way to shore, they discovered a cabin occupied by an Alaska Railroad worker's family and were able to contact authorities by radio. The next day, a helicopter rescued them from the cabin and Schmidt and others began the work to assess the impact of the earthquake. Video illustrating the effects of the Great Alaska Earthquake.

Saucier and Denison state that Schmidt was appointed to serve as the federal coordinator for the Engineering and Geological Evaluation Group, and led a team of 50 scientists to assess the damage and to make recommendations for the future rebuilding of the city of Anchorage. However, a letter from then Governor William A. Egan thanking Schmidt for her \\"dedication and foresightedness\\"Egan, William A. (1964). Letter dated May 20, 1964. Ruth A. M.

Box 4, Folder 16. indicates that the federal government was not initially involved. On a job application dated 1974, Schmidt indicates that she was the coordinator and the geologist in charge of the project, and that the position ended because the \\"federal government took over.\\" Additionally, the \\"Guide to the Anchorage Engineering Geology Evaluation Group papers\\", written by Megan K. Friedel, states that the group of scientists was sponsored by the Alaska State Housing Authority and the City of Anchorage,Friedel, Megan K. (2010).

HMC-0051. https://archives.consortiumlibrary.org/collections/specialcollections/hmc-0051/ not the federal government. Friedel also notes that the scientists included geologists, soil scientists, federal and state engineers, and scientists from private companies. There was significant conflict between Schmidt and the Anchorage Engineering and Geological Evaluation Group that she led and downtown business leaders and real estate developers.Schmidt, Ruth A. M. (1964). \\"Geology in a hurry.\\" Geotime 9(4): 13‚Äì15. Business leaders and developers published angry letters in the Anchorage Times, a local pro- business newspaper. While Schmidt and the other scientists wanted to carefully study the damage and to identify future risks, developers and other business leaders wanted to charge ahead with the rebuilding process. The scientific group led by Schmidt was able to complete its study and published its final report on May 8, 1964, roughly a month after the earthquake occurred. Schmidt donated the documents related to the report in 1981 to the UAA/APU Archives and Special Collections at the University of Alaska Anchorage.  Consultancy work  On January 1, 1964, Schmidt launched a geological consulting service from her home located at 1040 C Street in Anchorage, AK. Her business license lists the name as R A M Schmidt, PhD.Alaska Business License #58775 (2003). Ruth A. M. Schmidt papers, 1912‚Äì2015.

On a job application dated 1974, she notes that she worked as a \\"consulting geologist [to] prepare reports on wells from [the] North Slope, Gulf of Alaska, other areas; engineering geology reports, building sites, [and] road construction for clients.\\" It was in this capacity that she led the Anchorage Engineering and Geological Evaluation Group to study the effects of the Great Alaska Earthquake. In May 1964, Governor William A. Egan wrote Schmidt a letter to thank her for her \\"dedication and foresightedness\\" on this project. In 1974‚Äì1975, she was an environmental consultant to the Governor of Alaska on the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). For this work, she traveled up and down the TAPS to inspect environmental impacts, restoration work, and the condition of the work camps. Governor Jay Hammond awarded her a State of Alaska Commendation \\"for serving the interest of the people of the State of Alaska as a member of the Pipeline Coordinators Office during construction of the Trans Alaska Oil Pipeline,\\" on June 13, 1977.Hammond, Jay.

Loyalty hearings   Washington Cooperative Bookshop  During the McCarthy era, Schmidt was investigated twice for possible disloyalty to the US government. At issue was her involvement with the Washington Cooperative Bookshop, a retail store in Washington, DC, that sold books, records, magazines, and art. Persons who joined the cooperative as members received a discount on purchases. The Bookshop advocated for racial equality between African Americans (then called Negroes) and whites during a time when Washington was largely racially segregated, and sold books on African American topics, records featuring black musicians, and sponsored lectures, social activities, and concerts for interracial audiences.The Bookshopper.

Truman on March 21, 1947 On December 5, 1947, the Washington Post published a list of organizations that Attorney General Tom C. Clark had branded as subversive and/or communistic.Stokes, Dillard. (December 5, 1947). \\"91 Groups Branded Subversive by Clark; Loyalty Board Gets List: Selection Includes Movements Branded Totalitarian, Fascist and Communistic.\\" Washington Post No. 26,104: 1, 10. The list came to be known as the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations, or AGLOSO. This was the first time the list was made public, although parts of the original list, compiled in 1943, had previously been leaked. The list was based on secret information, and the organizations listed were not given opportunities to see the evidence that led to their listing, nor were they able to refute the allegations. The list was created after President Harry S. Truman issued Executive Order 9835 that established a loyalty review process to ensure that no one who was disloyal to the US government would be federally employed. The Washington Cooperative Bookshop was included on the 1947 list that was published in the Washington Post; the Bookshop was categorized as Communistic. The reasons given for the listing included sale of communist literature and the fact that the Bookshop hosted speakers thought to be communist or subversive. Of particular concern in Schmidt's case was the sale of the magazines The New Masses; literature associated with the American Youth Congress; pamphlets and other material published by the American Peace Mobilization, and Schmidt's attendance and participation in lectures such as that by Edwin C. Randall about the political implications of atomic energy. Schmidt said this about why she became a member: > I became a member of the Washington Cooperative Bookshop in August 1945 ... > Since my arrival in Washington during the war (I came in early 1943) I had > been disturbed by the segregation of negroes , and the unequal treatment > they received in the capital of our country. I felt that such a situation > was bad for this country, particularly when we were waging a war for equal > rights, and against discrimination. In 1945, towards the end of this war, I > happened to read Richard Wright's BLACK BOY‚Äîand this incensed me to the > point of wanting to do something besides talk about it. I had heard of the > Bookshop, probably from a folder I may have picked up in the store, as I > frequently browsed in the bookstores along 17th street on the way to the > Virginia buses on K Street. As I have always approved of cooperatives ... I > decided to join this cooperative bookshop that claimed to be interracial.  1950 hearing  In 1947, while she was working for the USGS, Schmidt completed a routine loyalty review under Executive Order 9835, and received notification that she was cleared in 1949. In 1950, the issue of her membership in the Washington Cooperative Bookshop again came to the attention of the Department of Interior Loyalty Board, triggered, Schmidt thought, because she had applied to work for the Atomic Energy Commission. She was officially charged with disloyalty to the US government in a letter dated August 15, 1950.Compton, E. L., Secretary, Interior Department Loyalty Board. (1950).

Upon Cobb's suggestion, Schmidt wrote to former professors, graduate school colleagues, friends, and co-workers to request that they submit a notarized affidavit testifying to her integrity, her loyalty to the US government, and her views about communism. There are carbon copies of 17 such letters of request among Schmidt's papers in the UAA/APU Archives and Special Collections.Schmidt, Ruth A. M. (1950).

There were four members of the Loyalty Board present; five witnesses spoke on Schmidt's behalf. At the hearing, Schmidt acknowledged that she had \\"been a member of and sympathetically associated with the Washington Bookshop Association.\\" Asked what other organizations she belonged to, Schmidt responded: > I have a list‚Äîthe Washington Association of Scientists, Geological Society > of Washington, Paleontological Society of Washington, Society of Economic > Paleontologists and Mineralogists (SEPM), American Registry of X-Ray > Technicians, Red Cross, Community Chest, Blue Cross, and Sigma Xi. On January 15, 1951, E. L.

Schmidt again hired David Cobb to be her attorney. In her written response to the charges, dated April 30, 1954, she re-submitted much of the same testimony about the Washington Bookshop that she had submitted in 1950. She explained her relationships to the 21 people, saying that she knew some of them as passing acquaintances, while some were social friends. Some of the people she said she did not recall or had only partial recollection of them.Ruth A. M. Schmidt papers, 1912‚Äì2015.

She suffered from dementia in her later life, and died at the age of 97 on March 29, 2014. Her obituary notes that a celebration of life was held. While living and also after her death, Schmidt was a philanthropist. In her will, she donated significant funds to 22 charities, most of them located in Alaska. She created the Schmidt Charitable Trust, originally named in honor of her parents, Edward and Anna Range Schmidt, that provides financial assistance for Alaskan students of any age who study earth sciences; special preference is given for Alaska Native students and other ethnic minorities. She donated regularly to the American Civil Liberties Union, the Anchorage chapter of the Audubon Society, and to Anchorage area cultural organizations, social service organizations, and to conservation groups. She also contributed to Common Cause, a national non-partisan pro-democracy group and to Public Citizen. In 1998, she made an anonymous donation of $10,000 to the Alaska Museum of Natural History. After her death, Trustees for Alaska, a non-profit organization that works to foster the well-being of Alaska's natural environment, was happily surprised that Schmidt had left a bequest to their organization. In 1960, Schmidt had purchased 4.8 acres of wetland in what was then an outlying area of the city of Anchorage.Ruth A. M. Schmidt papers, 1912‚Äì2015. UAA/APU Consortium Library Archives and Special Collections, University of Alaska Anchorage. HMC-0792. Box 2, Folder 4. She paid $2000 for the land. By 2012, when Schmidt donated the land to the Great Land Trust, who in turn donated it to the Municipality of Anchorage Parks and Recreation Department, the land was valued at nearly $300,000. Schmidt was a pioneer for women in the sciences, and acted as an enthusiastic mentor, role model, and colleague for women students. She is credited with laying \\"the foundation of the geoscience curriculum\\" at the University of Alaska Anchorage. Schmidt was posthumously inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2015.

Introduction The British Sleep Society has an inclusive approach to all specialists related to sleep medicine and sleep research. Members include both academic and clinical specialists, particularly neurologists, pulmonologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, pediatricians, geriatricians as well as neurophysiologists, circadian rhythm experts, nurses and a large number of technologists in sleep laboratories. The Society currently has over 400 members under leadership provided by a 10-member executive board, and a subcommittee coordinates scientific meetings and training courses. The organisation was founded in response to the increase of awareness of sleep apnea and its clinical importance. Over the next few years it broadened to include neurological and physiological interests with strong emphasis on technical aspects and polysomnography. Special interest groups in areas such as pediatrics and actigraphy have been established. It now provides a comprehensive resource to clinical, research and technical specialties. Affiliation The Society works with other medical specialist bodies to promote sleep medicine as a medical subspecialty in the UK. The Registration Council for Clinical Physiologistshttps://www.rccp.co.uk/ holds a register of practitioners in six disciplines, one of which is sleep physiology. As part of this the Society is a registered professional body within the Council,https://www.rccp.co.uk/articles/110/The-British-Sleep-Society-BSS with the aim to improve the safety of patient care. The Society is affiliated with the European Sleep Research Society. Meetings and training The Society runs an annual spring technologist conference, aimed at providing training in all aspects of sleep medicine. The Society also holds an annual scientific meeting, to listen to presentations on the latest research and clinical developments in sleep and the treatment of sleep disorders. It is the largest meeting in Great Britain dedicated to sleep.

It occupies 426 acres with three roads, the main Coniamstown Rd leads from the old course to the castle at the top of Bright hill. Within County Down, it is the 587th largest townland.http://www.placenamesni.org/resultdetails.php?entry=12809http://www.placenamesni.org/resultdetails.php?entry=12809http://www.townlands.ie/down/bright/coniamstown/ The Mass rock in Coniamstown.  History  Coniamstown translates to Baile an Choiniamaigh in Gaelic, the area is believed to get its name from John de Balicoingham, rector of Ardquin. He was elected to the seat of Down in 1328 and was sent by the Pope to Cork in 1330. The area retained his name thereafter. The townland includes significant historical wealth with a least two ruined chapels. The medieval chapel was located at the end of the avenue leading to Coniamstown House. It is recorded as Capella de Baliconyngham in the Papal Taxation of c.1306. No traces of it are visible from the ground however it can be seen in satellite imagery. It was built sometime in the 1200s or before. It was in complete ruin by 1622. A graveyard is present and quantities of human bones have been found there along with headstones. A hospital for the infirm there was mentioned in the margin of the original roll of Pope Nicholas's Taxation 1291. Its presence is indicated by the local term, Straney's Spital. It was named after the Straney family, while Spital is the Gaelic word for Hospital. This area is located near the border with the townland of Grangecam and the former race course. Sometime after the old chapel had fallen to ruin, the Penal laws were introduced to Ireland, and a Mass rock at the start of the twelve acre lane was used where Catholics worshiped during the Penal times, where the surrounding hills provided lookouts to spot patrols. The priest in 1704 was Rev. Seneca or Jenkin Smith and in 1768 was Rev. Magnus Grant. A new chapel was erected in Coniamstown about 1745, replaced by a better chapel in 1796. In 1836 it was described as having no seats, but could accommodate 400 people. It was built in a T shape. It was located on the twelve acre lane near the border of the townland of Whigamstown in an area now called the Chapel field. The chapel was replaced by a new chapel in Legamaddy by Rev. Richard Killen. The foundation stone was laid 27 Aug 1862 and consecrated on 22 Oct 1865 by Dr. Denvir. That day's sermon was preached by Dr. Dorrian. It is in Gothic style, designed by John O'Neill, a Belfast architect. The area was once home to a Motte and Bailey castle. The exact date of its construction is unknown. The large mound of the baily remains visible. The castle was located on the site of Coniamstown House. The Normans built fortresses all over Ireland beginning around 1169. John De Courcey reached Downpatrick around 1176. The Normans may have built the castle to protect their supply lines to the coast not long after 1176. The castle was likely abandoned before the more imposing stone castle was built on top of Bright hill in the late 15th century. A field in the area around Conaimstown House was home to an early Christian monastery, most likely built around the 7th century. A communal fire/charcoal production was located in one of the nearby bogs. The train from Downpatrick that used to run through the Townland closed in the 1950s. Markers and bridges of the old line remain.  Agriculture  Potatoes, turnips, kale, hay and silage are grown there. Cattle and sheep are farmed. Wetlands are common, fed by many small rivers, supporting wildlife and birds.

It was later released as a part of the story collection The Malachite Box. \\"The Stone Flower\\" is considered to be one of the best stories in the collection. The story was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams in 1944, and several times after that. Pavel Bazhov indicated that all his stories can be divided into two groups based on tone: \\"child-toned\\" (e.g. \\"Silver Hoof\\") with simple plots, children as the main characters, and a happy ending,Litovskaya 2014, p. 247. and \\"adult-toned\\". He called \\"The Stone Flower\\" the \\"adult-toned\\" story. The tale is told from the point of view of the imaginary Grandpa Slyshko (; lit. \\"Old Man Listenhere\\").  Publication  The Moscow critic Viktor Pertsov read the manuscript of \\"The Stone Flower\\" in the spring of 1938, when he traveled across the Urals with his literary lectures. He was very impressed by it and published the shortened story in Literaturnaya Gazeta on 10 May 1938. His complimenting review The fairy tales of the Old Urals () which accompanied the publication. After the appearance in Literaturnaya Gazeta, the story was published in first volume of the Uralsky Sovremennik in 1938.Bazhov 1952, p. 243. It was later released as a part of Malachite Box collection on 28 January 1939.

The story was published in the collection Russian Magic Tales from Pushkin to Platonov, published by Penguin Books in 2012. The title was translated by Anna Gunin as \\"The Stone Flower\\".  Plot summary Vladimir Preobrazhensky as Danilo in The Tale of the Stone Flower ballet, 1 March 1954. The main character of the story, Danilo, is a weakling and a scatterbrain, and people from the village find him strange. He is sent to study under the stone-craftsman Prokopich. One day he is given an order to make a fine-molded cup, which he creates after a thornapple. It turns out smooth and neat, but not beautiful enough for Danilo's liking. He is dissatisfied with the result. He says that even the simplest flower \\"brings joy to your heart\\", but his stone cup will bring joy to no one. Danilo feels as if he just spoils the stone. An old man tells him the legend that a most beautiful Stone Flower grows in the domain of the Mistress of the Copper Mountain, and those who see it start to understand the beauty of stone, but \\"life loses all its sweetness\\" for them. They become the Mistress's mountain craftsmen forever. Danilo's fianc√©e Katyenka asks him to forget it, but Danilo longs to see the Flower. He goes to the copper mine and finds the Mistress of the Copper Mountain. He begs her to show him the Flower. The Mistress reminds him of his fianc√©e and warns Danilo that he would never want to go back to his people, but he insists. She then shows him the Malachite Flower. Danilo goes back to the village, destroys his stone cup and then disappears. \\"Some said he'd taken leave of his senses and died somewhere in the woods, but others said the Mistress had taken him to her mountain workshop forever\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 67. Sources The main character of the story, Danilo the Craftsman, was based on the real miner Danila Zverev (; 1858‚Äì1938). Bazhov met him at the lapidary studio in Sverdlovsk. Zverev was born, grew up and spent most of his life in Koltashi village, Rezhevsky District. Before the October Revolution Zverev moved to Yekaterinburg, where he took up gemstone assessment. Bazhov later created another skaz about his life, \\"Dalevoe glyadeltse\\". Danila Zverev and Danilo the Craftsman share many common traits, e.g. both lost their parents early, both tended cattle and were punished for their dreaminess, both suffered from poor health since childhood. Danila Zverev was so short and thin that the villagers gave him the nickname \\"Lyogonkiy\\" (). Danilo from the story had another nickname \\"Nedokormysh\\" (). Danila Zverev's teacher Samoil Prokofyich Yuzhakov () became the source of inpisration for Danilo the Craftsman's old teacher Prokopich.  Themes During Soviet times, every edition of The Malachite Box was usually prefaced by an essay by a famous writer or scholar, commenting on the creativity of the Ural miners, cruel landlords, social oppression and the \\"great workers unbroken by the centuries of slavery\\".Nikulina 2003, p. 76. The later scholars focused more on the relationship of the characters with nature, the Mountain and the mysterious in general.Nikulina 2003, p. 77. Maya Nikulina comments that Danilo is the creator who is absolutely free from all ideological, social and political contexts. His talent comes from the connection with the secret force, which controls all his movements. Moreover, the local landlord, while he exists, is unimportant for Danilo's story. Danilo's issues with his employer are purely aesthetic, i.e., a custom-made vase was ordered, but Danilo, as an artist, only desires to understand the beauty of stone, and this desire takes him away from life. The Stone Flower is the embodiment of the absolute magic power of stone and the absolute beauty, which is beyond mortals' reach. Many noted that the Mistress' world represents the realm of the dead, which is emphasized not only by its location underneath the human world but also mostly by its mirror-like, uncanny, imitation or negation of the living world.Balina 2013, p. 273. Everything looks strange there, even the trees are cold and smooth like stone. The Mistress herself does not eat or drink, she does not leave any traces, her clothing is made of stone and so on. The Mountain connects her to the world of the living, and Danilo metaphorically died for the world, when we went to her. Mesmerized by the Flower, Danilo feels at his own wedding as if he were at a funeral. A contact with the Mistress is a symbolic manifestation of death. Marina Balina noted that as one of the \\"mountain spirits\\", she does not hesitate to kill those who did not pass her tests, but even those who had been rewarded by her do not live happily ever after, as shown with Stepan in \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\". The Mistress was also interpreted as the manifestation of female sexuality. \\"The Mistress exudes sexual attraction and appears as its powerful source\\".Balina 2013, p. 270. Mark Lipovetsky commented that Mistress embodies the struggle and unity between Eros and Thanatos. The Flower is made of cold stone for that very reason: it points at death along with sexuality.Lipovetsky 2014, p. 220. All sexual references in Pavel Bazhov's stories are very subtle, owing to Soviet puritanism.Lipovetsky 2014, p. 218. Danilo is a classical Bazhov binary character. On the one hand, he is a truth seeker and a talented craftsman, on the other hand, he is an outsider, who violates social norms, destroys the lives of the loved ones and his own. The author of The Fairy Tale Encyclopedia suggests that the Mistress represents the conflict between human kind and nature. She compares the character with Mephistopheles, because a human needs to wager his soul with the Mistress in order to get the ultimate knowledge. Danilo wagers his soul for exceptional craftsmanship skills.Budur 2005, p. 124. However, the Mistress does not force anyone to abandon their moral values, and therefore \\"is not painted in dark colours\\".Budur 2005, p. 285. Lyudmila Skorino believed that she represented the nature of the Urals, which inspires a creative person with its beauty.Bazhov 1952, p. 232. Denis Zherdev commented that the Mistress's female domain is the world of chaos, destruction and spontaneous uncontrolled acts of creation (human craftsmen are needed for the controlled creation). Although the characters are so familiar with the female world that the appearance of the Mistress is regarded as almost natural and even expected, the female domain collides with the ordered factory world, and brings in randomness, variability, unpredictability and capriciousness. Direct contact with the female power is a violation of the world order and therefore brings destruction or chaos. One of the themes is how to become a true artist and the subsequent self-fulfillment. The Soviet critics' point of view was that the drama of Danilo came from the fact that he was a serf, and therefore did not receive the necessary training to complete the task. However, modern critics disagree and state that the plot of the artist's dissatisfaction is very popular in literature. Just like in the Russian poem The Sylph, written by Vladimir Odoyevsky, Bazhov raises the issue that the artist can reach his ideal only when he comes in with the otherworldly.Sozina, E. \\"O nekotorykh motivah russkoj klassicheskoj literatury v skazah P.

In 1944 the story was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams and published by Hutchinson as a part of the collection The Malachite Casket: Tales from the Urals. The title was translated as \\"The Master Craftsman\\".Bazhov 1944, p. 95. In the 1950s translation of The Malachite Casket, made by Eve Manning, the story was published as \\"The Mountain Craftsman\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 68. The story was published in the collection Russian Magic Tales from Pushkin to Platonov, published by Penguin Books in 2012. The title was translated by Anna Gunin as \\"The Mountain Master\\". The story begins after the disappearance of Danilo. For several years Danilo's betrothed Katyenka (Katya) waits for him and stays unmarried despite the fact that everyone laughs at her. She is the only person who believes that Danilo will return. She is quickly nicknamed \\"Dead Man's Bride\\". When both of her parents die, she moves away from her family and goes to Danilo's house and takes care of his old teacher Prokopich, although she knows that living with a man can ruin her reputation. Prokopich welcomes her happily. He earns some money by gem-cutting, Katya runs the house, cooks, and does the gardening. When Prokopich gets too old to work, Katya realizes that she cannot possibly support herself by needlework alone. She asks him to teach her some stone craft. Prokopich laughs at first, because he does not believe gem-cutting is a suitable job for a woman, but soon relents. He teaches her how to work with malachite. After he dies, Katya decides to live in the house alone. Her strange behaviour, her refusal to marry someone and lead a normal life cause people at the village to think that she is insane or even a witch, but Katya firmly believes that Danilo will \\"learn all he wants to know, there in the mountain, and then he'll come\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 70. She wants to try making medallions and selling them. There are no gemstones left, so she goes to the forest, finds an exceptional piece of gemstone and starts working. After the medallions are finished, she goes to the town to the merchant who used to buy Prokopich's work. He reluctantly buys them all, because her work is very beautiful. Katya feels as if this was a token from Danilo. She runs back to the forest and starts calling for him. The Mistress of the Copper Mountain appears. Katya bravely demands that she gives Danilo back. The Mistress takes her to Danilo and says: \\"Well, Danilo the Master Craftsman, now you must choose. If you go with her you forget all that is mine, if you remain here, then you must forget her and all living people\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 80. Danilo chooses Katya, saying that he thinks about her every moment. The Mistress is pleased with Katya's bravery and rewards her by letting Danilo remember everything that he had learned in the Mountain. She then warns Danilo to never tell anyone about his life there. The couple thanks the Mistress and goes back to the village. When asked about his disappearance, Danilo claims that he simply left to Kolyvan to train under another craftsman. He marries Katya. His works is extraordinary, and everyone starts calling him \\"the mountain craftsman\\". Other books  This family's story continues in \\"A Fragile Twig\\", published in 1940. \\"A Fragile Twig\\" focuses on Katyenka and Danilo's son Mitya. This is the last tale about Danilo's family. Bazhov had plans for the fourth story about Danilo's family, but it was never written. In the interview to a Soviet newspaper Vechernyaya Moskva the writer said: \\"I am going to finish \\"The Stone Flower\\" story. I would like to write about the heirs of the protagonist, Danilo, [I would like] to write about their remarkable skills and aspirations for the future. I'm thinking about leading the story to the present day\\".: \\"–°–æ–±–∏—Ä–∞—é—Å—å –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω—á–∏—Ç—å —Å–∫–∞–∑ –æ \\"–ö–∞–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º —Ü–≤–µ—Ç–∫–µ\\". –ú–Ω–µ —Ö–æ—á–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å –≤ –Ω–µ–º –ø—Ä–µ–µ–º–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –µ–≥–æ –≥–µ—Ä–æ—è, –î–∞–Ω–∏–ª—ã, –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –æ–± –∏—Ö –∑–∞–º–µ—á–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –º–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ, —É—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≤ –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–µ. –î–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞ –¥—É–º–∞—é –¥–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏ –¥–æ –Ω–∞—à–∏—Ö –¥–Ω–µ–π\\".

It was adapted from a 1903 Grand Guignol play (also starring Gouget) by Andr√© de Lorde, which was itself based on the 1845 short story The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether by Edgar Allan Poe. It has been called the first French feature-length horror film. The film was the first of two Grand Guignol adaptations directed by Tourneur, written by de Lorde, and starring Gouget and Roussel; the second would be 1914's Figures de cire. Plot The plot revolves around a journalist, who, accompanied by his wife, travels to an old castle (complete with moat) which has been turned into an asylum, in the hopes of writing about a new approach to curing patients which is said to be practiced there. Arriving during a storm, they quickly discover that the inmates have taken over, and that the \\"cure\\" to insanity is gouging out an eye and slitting the throat. One \\"doctor\\" seems to be practicing this technique; another believes that he can float. Escape seems impossible, and the reporter is drawn to a table to undergo the \\"cure\\", but a gust of wind scattering the \\"doctor's\\" papers provides a distraction, and, with the help of a sympathetic inmate, the two protagonists are able to flee to safety. Cast Contemporary trade review (using the US title The Lunatics) * Henri Gouget as Goudron * Henry Roussel as Tourist * Ren√©e Sylvaire as Tourist's wife * Bahier as Plume * Robert Saidreau  Critical reception  Hanford Judson, writing for industry trade magazine The Moving Picture World in 1914, called the film ‚Äúthe kind of picture that will put immediate quietus on any buzz of conversation in the auditorium and will be called a ‚Äòterrible, powerful‚Äô picture. It is artistic, real, and gripping,‚Äù and praised the cinematography, along with Gouget's performance. Tourneur biographer Harry Waldman described the film as \\"...one of the first truly original French films - the earliest of the Grand-Guignol genre and the most celebrated if not most shocking of its day.\\" References Bibliography * Waldman, Harry.

He was born in North Adelaide, the son of Henry Dutton, the \\"Squire of Anlaby\\" (1844 ‚Äì 26 August 1914), and studied at St. Peter's College, Lancing College, Essex, and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he rowed against Cambridge and graduated MA. He inherited the pastoral property \\"Anlaby\\", near Kapunda in 1914 from his father. He was a keen motorist and in November 1907 attempted the trip to Darwin with noted cyclist-mechanic Murray Aunger (1878‚Äì1953) in a 20‚Äì24 h.p. Talbot, but was forced to abandon the car when it broke down near Tennant Creek. Dutton and Aunger again left Adelaide on 30 June 1908 in a similar vehicle and were joined en route by Ernest Allchurch (c.1870‚Äì1932) the Telegraph Officer from Alice Springs. The three completed the journey on 20 August, having recovered the first Talbot on the way. The car and its steel- studied Michelin tyres were reported as having performed flawlessly. In 1921 he and his wife motored from Oodnadatta to Katherine; she was the first woman to make that trip. He and T. L. Browne purchased Corona Station in 1910, and sold it to Sidney Kidman in 1917.

Background and fields of interest  Anton grew up in Trossingen and studied sociology, history and cognitive sciences at Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t in Freiburg, Germany. While in school and later during his studies, he worked as an intern at the Freiburg Institut f√ºr Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene (IGPP). The IGPP is a private research institute and maintains a specialized library and research archive closely related to Hans Bender's former parapsychology chair at Freiburg University. Anton is interested in anomalistics and conspiracy theories, and is currently working on a doctorate on occultism and parapsychologyical topics in the former GDR. He is the brother of Matthias Anton, a German saxophonist and jazz musician, and is the grandson of German author Herbert Walz.  Publications and academic work With regard to Esoteric Nazism, his work indicates that earlier descriptions of the relationship between Nazi ideologies and occultism (either excluding any relationship or stating a strong one) do not describe properly the rather polycratic and zigzagging complicated setup.Gerd H.

The newspaper stated Anton's experience, that it is rather difficult to discuss matters with devoted conspiracy theorists, but smaller (and new) parties seem to attract them. The basic feeling of some of the adherents of new parties, which raise doubts about the news reports from classical media is - however - in line with some of Anton's assumptions. He was quoted as saying, \\"we experience simplification of overcomplex topics.

Since the original debut of Duval and Wicklund's self-awareness theory in 1972, many experimental psychologists have refined theory and ideas concerning the causes and consequences of self- focused attention. Self-focused attention or self-awareness as often discussed in the context of social psychology refers to situational self-awareness, as opposed to dispositional self-focus. Dispositional self-focus more accurately relates to the construct of self-consciousness, which allows psychologists to measure individual differences in the tendency to think about and attend to the self.  History and description  Prior to the development of the specific idea of objective self-awareness by Duval and Wicklund in the 1970s, psychologists, philosophers, and sociologists pursued scholarly work related to other relevant forms of self-referential mental processes. For example, William James, a founder of modern psychology, wrote about a wide array of self-focused processes in The Principles of Psychology and other scholarly publications. A specific area of interest of James was how we feel about ourselves. He wrote that self-esteem related feelings were partially determined by our personal goals and our perceived accomplishments, foreshadowing many similar lines of experimental research in contemporary personality and social psychology. Decades later, sociologist Charles Cooley and psychologist George Herbert Mead solidified a symbolic interactionist framework for examining the origin of the sense of self. Compared to James' earlier writings on self-esteem related feelings, Cooley and Mead's framework posited that a standard reference for behavioral comparison was not a personally derived goal per se, but was the socially derived perspective of a \\"generalized other\\". The perspective of the generalized other essentially represented an amalgamation of the many social standards imposed on an individual as he or she grows and matures in society. Following in line with some but not all of the ideas of their theoretical predecessors, researchers Duval and Wicklund constructed one of the first coherent theories of self- awareness in psychology in 1972, written in their book A Theory of Objective Self-Awareness. Objective Self-awareness (OSA) theory described a self-system in which the locus of conscious attention automatically influenced one's levels of self-evaluation. In this original conceptualization, the scientists viewed the system as consisting of a self (a person's knowledge of themselves) and standards. Duval and Wicklund carefully clarified their use of the term \\"standards\\" in their 1972 book: :\\"Defined as a mental representation of correct behavior, attitudes, and traits...the standard of correctness taken together define what a 'correct' person is\\" The psychological system elaborated by Duval and Wicklund was geared towards achieving internal consistency among its components, self and standards. When there was a discrepancy or difference between the self and certain relevant standards, a mental conflict emerged within the system. This was viewed as a state of negative affect, a state which had to be fixed or avoided. On one hand, the system could change its behavior and mental states to match the relevant standards; on the other hand, the system could avoid the conflict by escaping self-focus altogether, and thus halting the self-evaluation process. Duval and Wicklund's state of self-awareness therefore always correlated with negative affect. Other experimental researchers would later show that self-awareness could correlate with positive affect in certain situations.  Links to cognitive processes  A large body of research literature has evolved focusing on the interplay of self-awareness, causal attribution, and action. Researchers have focused on how individuals perceive how involved they are in the cause of events leading to either success or failure. Experiments have shown that when people are induced to be more self-aware, they are more likely to attribute the success to themselves. In addition, they have higher self- esteem than individuals who have low self-awareness. On the other hand, failure attributions are somewhat more complicated. This complexity is due to the fact that researchers have found that either people's behavioral performance may be altered or the perception of the social standard may be changed in the event of a self-discrepancy. One study specifically found that highly self-aware individuals only attributed failure to themselves when they thought that they had a reasonable opportunity to change their behavioral performance and succeed later. Other lines of research have examined how objective self-awareness relates to moral decision making. Batson and colleagues explored research looking at how changing self-focused attention and the salience of a moral standard affected judgments related to fairness. Participants in the study were asked to make a decision about giving a rewarding outcome, called the \\"positive consequences\\" task, to themselves or another person. Only when made to be feel self-focused and the presence of the moral standard was salient were the participants highly likely (about 92% of the time) to give the other person the positive rewarding outcome which aligned with the supposed \\"fair\\" decision option. In relation to empathy, Gerace and colleagues examined the relationship between self- reflection‚Äîincluding objective self-awareness and the trait of private self- consciousness‚Äîand perspective taking. In their review of the literature, these researchers argued that in studies where participants are made self-aware, they exhibit behaviours indicative of considering another person's point of view.  Links to executive and regulation processes  One way in which people deal with self-focus is through reduction of self-standard discrepancies. As stated prior, people's perceptions of their standards may also change during the course of self-regulation when encountering failure. An experiment has found that when individuals are highly self-focused and attend to a behavioral standard, they are likely to see the standard in a negative light following failure than are other individuals. Moreover, they are more likely to change the perception of the behavioral standard to correspond to their performance and are not as likely to try to better their performance on a second try. Another line of research proposes another way by which people's behavior changes as a result of self-focused attention. If the reduction of self-standard discrepancy seems inefficient or impossible, people will often seek to avoid or escape self-awareness altogether. Studies examine these psychological processes by examining how people react to demanding tasks. Research has found that self-focused people that deem their rate of progress on a task unacceptable will be more likely to avoid the task goals and therefore escape states of task driven self-awareness. On the other hand, people that deemed their efforts to diminish the self-standard discrepancy potentially effective were more likely to persist.  Links to affect and motivation  Early conceptualizations of links between affect and objective self-awareness have evolved due to careful experimentation in social psychology. The original conceptualization of objective self-awareness theory proposed by Duval and Wicklund suggested that a state of self-focused attention was an aversive state. That is, when people are drawn to focus on themselves like an external evaluator would, they are more likely to develop a negative mood state. An early experiment following the original writing showed that the relationship between self-focus and mood is more complex than originally thought. The study showed that the intensity of negative mood experienced related to how participants perceived the discrepancy between their current behavior and the social standard; for participants that thought the discrepancy between behavior and standard was unchangeable, they were much more likely to experience negative affect. Other theoretical approaches suggest that interplay of self-focus and affect depends largely on the type of behavioral standard being emphasized. In particular, research using self- discrepancy theory developed by Tory Higgins focuses on two types of standards, ought and ideal standards. Ought standards represent self-states that relate to other's beliefs about the responsibilities or duties. Ideal standards represent self-states that relate to an individual's goals or ambitions. Mismatching of self (current behavior) to either of these standards leads to different stereotyped affective behaviors. While being self-focused, a perceived discrepancy between current behavior and the ought standard will elicit feelings of agitation or anxiety. On the other hand, while being self- focused, a perceived discrepancy between current behavior and the ideal standard will lead to feelings of dejection and disappointment.

British political activist Maajid Nawaz, American political talk-show hosts such as Bill Maher and Dave Rubin, and New Atheist writers like Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins are among those who have used the term.  Concept  In 2007, Maajid Nawaz, a former Islamist who had renounced his association with the radical Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir in favor of secular Islam, used the phrase \\"regressive left\\" to describe left-leaning people who‚Äîin his opinion‚Äîpander to Islamism, which he defines as a \\"global totalitarian theo- political project\\" with a \\"desire to impose any given interpretation of Islam over society as law\\". He opposes this on the grounds that \\"any desire to impose any version of Islam over anyone anywhere, ever, is a fundamental violation of our basic civil liberties\\". In Nawaz's opinion, it is possible to denounce both neoconservative foreign policies such as the Iraq War (which he had opposed) and theocratic extremism, but those that he labels \\"regressive leftists\\" fail to do so.  Use of the term  In September 2015, Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz participated in a public forum hosted by Harvard University's Institute of Politics, which was later published in a short book, titled Islam and the Future of Tolerance (2015). In a review of the book in the magazine National Review Online, political writer Brian Stewart noted that according to both Nawaz and Harris \\"regressive leftists\\" in the West are \\"willfully blind\\" to the fact that jihadists and Islamists make up a significant portion (20% in Harris's estimate) of the global Muslim community and the minority Muslim communities within the West, even though these factions are opposed to liberal values such as individual autonomy, freedom of expression, democracy, women's rights, gay rights, etc. Nawaz and Harris have denounced the paradoxically illiberal, isolationist and censuring attitude towards any criticism of this phenomenon, which they contend betrays universal liberal values and also abandons supporting and defending the most vulnerable liberal members living within the Muslim community such as women, homosexuals and apostates. In October 2015, The Washington Times reported that American comedian and show host Bill Maher and British biologist and New Atheist author Richard Dawkins \\"lamented regressive leftists who fail to understand they are anything but liberal when it comes to Islam\\". Maher noted a willingness to criticise anything except Islam, excusing it as \\"their culture\\", to which Dawkins responded: \\"Well, to hell with their culture\\". Making reference to student initiatives to disinvite ex-Muslim speakers on campus, Dawkins saw this as \\"a betrayal of the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s\\". In October and November 2015, Sam Harris frequently used the term in his exchanges with the media, saying the greatest danger is that the \\"regressive left\\" is willing to give up freedom of speech \\"out of fear of offending minorities\\", which will lead to censorship imposed by those minorities, citing American journalist Glenn Greenwald's comments on the Charlie Hebdo shooting as an example. Harris considers Reza Aslan and Noam Chomsky to be of the regressive left.The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, 15 October 15, 2015, MSNBC. In November 2015 in an appearance on the talk radio show The Humanist Hour, author and philosopher Peter Boghossian defined the term as a pejorative used to describe those on the left that have made the \\"strangest bedfellows\\" with the Islamists. According to him, the word \\"regressive\\" is used to contrast with the word \\"progressive\\" ‚Äì the latter being the group that is egalitarian and wants to create systems of justice and racial equality, while the former being a group that \\"[looks] for the worst in people... and [does] not extend hermeneutics of charity, or a charitable interpretation of anything anyone says, but uses it as a hammer to beat people down\\". In addition, Boghossian believes that \\"regressive leftists\\" have become \\"hyper-moralists\\" and champions of their perceived victims. He cites the historical wrongdoings such as slavery in the United States and colonialism as a legitimate concern that has caused mistrust of anything Western and capitalistic. He also added that \\"there are people who have suffered and still suffer legitimate instances of racism, homophobia etc. The problem is that every time the word racist is just thrown around like that, that word loses its meaning. And it should have quite a sting. That should be a horrible word\\". In late 2015, talk show host Dave Rubin hosted discussions about the \\"regressive left\\" in several The Rubin Report segments. Rubin describes the regressive left as \\"the left's version of the Tea Party\\", saying that the regressive left will damage the Democratic Party in a similar way the Tea Party damages the Republican Party. Political commentator David Pakman supported the concept in his talk show, saying \\"there are liberals who do use cultural relativism and distaste for US foreign policy as an excuse to defend or at least minimize violence and injustice that they would certainly otherwise oppose\\". Pakman has distanced himself from the term, saying that it is misused by conservatives to insult all liberals. Pakman suggests that the actual regressive leftists are leftists who use authoritarianism to enforce progressivism.  Criticism  In November 2015, psychiatrist Khwaja Khusro Tariq, writing for The Huffington Post, classified the term as an unsubstantiated ad hominem attack, stating that the harshest critics of Islam are courted by both liberal and conservative media in the United States. Khusro also stated the term has been directed towards Glenn Greenwald and Noam Chomsky, both of whom he said have never condoned violence or opined on the doctrine of Islam. He argued that there was no genuine inhibition on speaking against the religion. In March 2016, Joseph Bernstein, a BuzzFeed reporter on web culture, wrote that according to Google Trends interest in the term \\"shot up\\" in late 2015. According to Bernstein, instead of criticising \\"cultural tolerance gone too far\\", the phrase has \\"become a catch-all for any element of the dominant new media culture that the anti-social justice warrior internet doesn't like\\". He also suggests that even though the term can be sourced back to self-described liberal commentators like Nawaz, Maher and Dawkins, it is frequently used by the alt-right and other anti-social justice warrior groups on Internet forums and social media as part of their rhetorical warfare.

It is located in the western part of Jutland just south of a small village called Stauning near Skjern. The distillery was founded in May 2005 by nine Danish whisky enthusiasts and is the oldest whisky distillery in the Kingdom of Denmark. The idea was originally to create a whisky resembling the peated whisky produced on the Scottish isle of Islay. The production is done mainly by hand using local grain and water. Everything is produced following the traditional Scottish methods of whisky production. The preparations started in a building owned by one of the nine founders, formerly used as a private slaughter-house. The building was renovated and official permission obtained. The first distillation took place in August 2006 and the following months the test production continued with ongoing improvements and streamlining of the process. In the fall of 2006 the nine owners met the whisky expert Jim Murray and presented the new spirit to him for a tasting. Murray was very positive and compared the results to the Ardbeg of the 1970s while recommending the owners to increase production. The chance meeting with Murray became the decision maker for the founders and in 2007 they purchased a small farm and moved the distillery from the private slaughter-house in the village of Stauning, to its current placement approximately 1.5 kilometers south of the village. In March 2009 production finally restarted. The production was increased to 6-8000 liters of whisky a year, from the 2-400 liters the owners had originally planned for. In March the first grain was malted and in April the distillation started for the first time in the new surroundings. Since then Stauning Whisky has received the prize for the best European rye whisky below seven years in the Whisky magazine awards, and the best European single malt. The distillery has also won critical acclaim in Murray's \\"Whisky Bible\\", where their Peated 1st Edition received 94 points out of 100. It was described as a \\"Superstar whisky that give us all a reason to live\\".  Production  The founders have chosen to do all parts of the production themselves. The grain is bought locally and the malting takes place in the form of floor malting in a process that takes about one week. After that the malt is dried in a kiln using hot air blown from below. For it to be a smoky whisky, the grain is dried with warm, smoky air from the burning of peat supplied by a Klosterlund Museum. This takes 2‚Äì3 days. The grain is then ground, mashed and set aside for maturation in 3 days. Once this process is done the wort is first distilled on a 1000-liter pot still and afterwards on a 600-liter pot still. Following the double-distillation the new spirit is ready. The alcohol percent is no between 68 and 69 and is diluted to 63.5 percent before it is put on oak casks where it matures for a minimum of 3 years before it is finally bottled as whisky. When new whisky is distilled, it is a colorless liquid and has only taste and aroma of alcohol and grain. It is from aging in charred oak barrels the whisky gets its color, complexity and flavor. In the years from 2009-2012 the distillery produced 6000 liters of new spirit a year. In the course of 2012 the production was more than doubled to 15.000 liters a year and finally in 2015 the distillery announced their plans for an expansion of the distillery capacity to 900.000 liters. This has led to an increase in the distillery workforce. From 2009-2012 the production was done by one man. In 2012 this increased to two men. In 2013 one of the founders were hired to take care of the administration and sales. At least four times a week guideds tour of the distillery are offered, with a tasting of the three main whisky variants of the production: Traditional, Peated and Young Rye whiskies.  Bottlings  All the whisky editions from Stauning Whisky are non-chill filtered and there is no color added in the process. All bottles come are of 50 cl. Stauning Whisky produces three standard whisky editions: * Traditional ** Made of barley. This type is a mild, round and balanced whiskey. For Stauning Traditional smoke is not used during drying of the malt. ** Awards: *** 2013: The Whisky Bible 2014: Traditional 2nd Edition: 85 points * Peated ** Made of barley. This type is a smoked version, done by smoking the malt with peat smoke from peat excavated by Klosterlund Museum. . ** Awards: *** 2012: The Whisky Bible 2013: Peated 1st Edition: 94 points: Liquid Gold Award *** 2013: national Review of Spirits Award: Peated 2nd Edition: Gold Medal *** 2013: The Whisky Bible 2014: Peated 1st Edition: 94.5 points: Liquid Gold Award * Young Rye ** Made on rye. As something quite rare in the whiskey world, Rye whisky is made on malted rye. To use malted rye is not only rare, it also offers a taste of rye, apple and apricot with fragrances of fruit and cinnamon. ** Awards: *** 2013: International Review of Spirits Award: Platinum Medal *** 2014: World Whiskies Award: Best European Rye under 7 years The distillery has also launched a small variety of special edition whiskies.

He was a consultant for the renovation of many temples in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and also the Royal Architect for the three royal families of Travancore, Cochin and Kozhikode (Calicut). He was a prolific writer authoring more than a hundred books on a variety of books relating to traditional knowledge areas like vastu shastra (architecture), jyothisha (astrology and astronomy), ayurveda (Indian system of medicine), and also books on history. He compiled a Sanskrit-Malayalam Dictionary and a Dictionary of Indigenous Medicines. Sankaran Namboodiripad was born as the ninth child of Kanippayyur Subramanian Namboothiripad, who himself was a great scholar in vasthu vidya, and Kanippayyur Kali Antharjanam. (According to some legends, after Parasurama created Kerala from the sea, the practice of various professions essential for the society were distributed among different families. In this process, Kanippayyur was a Namboothiri family to which was assigned the profession of architecture and construction of temples.) He had his traditional primary education and Rig Vedic studies at home. He took higher lessons in Rigveda at the famous Vedic School at Thrissur and became well versed in Sthapathya Veda and Astrology under the tutelage of his elders. He also studied Ayurveda. He rejuvenated Vaastu Shastra and popularized it further. He also started work centers for making icons and other ancillaries connected with temples. Kannippayur Narayanan Namboothiripad is often quoted from this family nowadays as he is a renowned Astrologer appearing in TV Shows,Online etc. Panchangam Press In 1929, Shankaran Namboodiripad established a printing press in Kunnamkulam to print mainly the almanacs prepared by him and other members of his family. The press, named Panchangam Press, has developed into an icon of Kunnakulam producing books related to Hindu religious practices. The press has brought out works on many knowledge systems like Vedas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Upanishads, Vedangas, Upavedas, Epics and Puranas, Tantra, Mantra, classical Sanskrit literature, etc. Another establishment is the Kanippayur Bookstall which is also functioning at Kunnamkulam since 1999. Research Library The descendants of Kanippayyur Shankaran Namboodiripad have established a research library in memory of Shankaran Namboodiripad at Kunnamkulam to continue the scholarly traditions of learning and research established by him. The Library founded in 1990 aims to be a repository of palm leaf manuscripts and books related to traditional Indian systems of knowledge, and to be a center for the propagation of such knowledge by bringing out translations of works in these knowledge areas. The Library also aims to be a pioneer in the popularization of Sanskrit language among the younger generation. The Library has procured large collections of manuscripts and books held in many Namboothiri houses.

Griffin (1949 - 2016) was an English poet born in Richmond, Surrey. He lived in Yorkshire, chiefly in Hull, York and Leeds, since 1969. After teaching and working in various casual capacities, he opened and ran a bookshop and was closely involved since the outset with the long series of poetry readings and publishing projects mounted by the Flux Gallery Press in Leeds. His works  Griffin's verse attracted notice along with work from Sean O'Brien, Tony Flynn, Peter Didsbury, Douglas Houston and others in Douglas Dunn's 1982 anthology A Rumoured City: New Poets from Hull. At this time, Griffin had already begun publishing poems in national periodicals following a recommendation made privately by Philip Larkin (see Selected Letters, ed. Anthony Thwaite, 1992). He was also receiving support and help with publication from Ted Hughes. His poetry is characterised by the uncompromising lyricism and imaginative energy with which its engages its social and personal concerns. Born Into An Unquiet (ed. Ian Parks) is a festschrift published to mark Griffin's sixtieth birthday. His work also features in Old City, New Rumours: A Hull Anthology (eds. Carol Rumens and Ian Gregson), a sequel to Dunn's 1982 anthology and Versions of the North: A Yorkshire Anthology (ed. Ian Parks).Tricycle Songs, a sequence of nine poems was published in 2013 and Moving from the South, his collected poems containing much hitherto unpublished material, appeared in 2014. Griffin read his work widely across the country including Ilkley Literature Festival (with Ken Smith), Hull Literature Festival (with Peter Didsbury and Andrew Motion), The Poetry Society in London and venues in Lincoln, Doncaster, Nottingham, Manchester, York, Leeds et al. Before his death Griffin was contributing to a projected work by Jules Smith on the Hull Poets, provisionally entitled Librarians and Barbarians.  Opinions of his works  'I am so glad that you felt able to take one of Griffin's poems. \\"The Pursuer\\" is the one I should have chosen ‚Äì he seemed well up to publishing standards ‚Äì he did seem to show an understanding of how a poem should be organised.' Philip Larkin Selected Letters, 1992 'Read these poems. It is worth attending to the craft and passion which made them, and they say things of which poetry is in need.' Douglas Dunn Foreword to Bread and Crowds, 1975 '...if the Selected Poems opens with a gesture to the post-modern void, it is in a post-romantic reaching towards the ineffable and man's spiritual relationship with the ineffable that Griffin stakes his claim to be a unique voice in contemporary poetry.' Ian Pople Born Into an Unquiet, 2010 '...the hurt ones include those who inhabit the \\"cider days\\" of the book's title..the lives of whose victims are recorded with a spare yet somehow soaring compassion.' Peter Didsbury B√™te Noire ‚Äì Hull Poets Special Edition, 1992 The publication of this long-awaited second collection (Kavita) confirms Griffin's status as a major talent...' Ian Parks Dreamcatcher 12, Spring 2003 'Griffin is more delicate (than the others); some of the poems, particularly the love poems, seem perched to take off into ecstasy.' Herbert Lomas London Magazine, 1983 'There's a transcendent clarity and uniqueness to Griffin's voice and verse. His poems created a dimension to which I had not been admitted before, a place of clear reason, compassion and luminous clarity. He never puts a foot wrong rhythmically. I can't think of any collection I've read recently that has such a consistent overall effect.' Douglas Houston Introduction to The Awakening CD, 2010 'Despite the variety of tones in Kavita, one is left with a collection that feels intimate, familiar and unified.'

He played a leading role in the development of the Spanish economy during the reign of Caudillo Francisco Franco that followed the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). Early years (1897‚Äì1927) Jos√© Mar√≠a Aguirre Gonzalo was born in San Sebasti√°n on 12 August 1897. He studied Civil Engineering at the Escuela T√©cnica Superior (Higher Technical School) in Madrid. He graduated in 1921. He would later teach accounting and business organization at this school. He then took some courses in Law. He began work with the Otamendi brothers on the Madrid Metro, which by 1919 had opened almost between the Sol and Cuatro Caminos stations. Pre-war years (1927‚Äì39) In 1927 Aguirre and his friend Alejandro San Rom√°n founded the Agrom√°n construction company. Aguirre was chairman, managing director and then honorary chairman of this company. In its early years Agrom√°n obtained major contracts in public works and buildings, and was involved in some important projects in the 1930s including the University City of Madrid (Ciudad Universitaria de Madrid) and the Castellana rail link. In 1934 Manuel S√°nchez Arcas (1897‚Äì1970) and Eduardo Torroja (1899‚Äì1961) founded the Instituto T√©cnico de la Construcci√≥n y Edificaci√≥n (ITCE, Technical Institute of Construction and Building). Other founding members were Aguirre Gonzalo, the architect Modesto L√≥pez Otero (1885‚Äì1962) and the engineer Alfonso Pe√±a Boeuf (1888‚Äì1966). The ITCE was a non-profit organization dedicated to developing and applying technical innovations in engineering civil structures. During the Second Spanish Republic Aguirre had difficulties with the authorities and was imprisoned. Post-war career (1939‚Äì88) After the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39) Agrom√°n, with Dragados, became the leading construction company in Spain. Aguirre played a central role in the economic development of the country, and founded or promoted major companies in a range of business sectors. He was an adviser to the Renfe railway company and the Compa√±√≠a Sevillana de Electricidad, and president of the Ribagorzana hydroelectric company, Acerinox steel company and Siemens Espa√±a engineering company. He was also a director and shareholder of the newspapers El Diario Vasco and Informaciones. He became president or member of the board of over fifty companies, and was one of the most visible and influential businessmen of the time. In common with other business leaders of the time, he had an authoritarian style and little interest in human relations concepts. Aguirre was a procurador in Francisco Franco's Cortes from 1961 to 1976, first as a representative of the Association of Civil Engineers, and then as a direct appointee by Franco. Aguirre denied having any political ambition, despite his seat in parliament, and turned down an offer by Franco to become Minister of Housing. He chaired the transport committee of the Spanish Plan for Economic and Social Development, and was a member of the national economic council. In the 1970s Franco named him vice-president of the highly political Fundamental Laws commission. Aguirre was also a member of various international organizations including the European Concrete Committee, the Spanish committee of the World Energy Council and the European Cultural Foundation. Aguirre was involved in banking from 1941. He became chairman of the Banco Guipuzcoano in 1956, and held this position until his death in April 1988, when he was replaced by his son, also named Jos√© Mar√≠a Aguirre Gonz√°lez, who had been a director of the bank for five years. He was also chairman of the Banco de Desarrollo Econ√≥mico y Social (Bank of Economic and Social Development). He was director and then vice-president of the Banco Espa√±ol de Cr√©dito (Banesto). He was appointed chairman of this bank in September 1970. Immediately after becoming chairman he initiated weekly luncheon meetings of the heads of the seven major banks. Monetary authorities were also invited to attend. By the 1980s the major banks in Spain were short of capital. Aguirre believed in specialization and opposed rationalization of the industry through mergers and acquisitions. He resigned from Banesto in 1983. Aguirre participated in creation of the Colegio de Ingenieros de Caminos (College of Civil Engineers), of which he was the first president, and the Colegio Universitario de Estudios Financieros (University College of Financial Studies) (CUNEF). He died of a heart attack on 7 April 1988 in the Cl√≠nica Ruber in Madrid at the age of 90.

On 3 January 2018, the Kommersant reported that rebel shelling on 31 December 2017 caused the deaths of 2 Russian military personnel and the loss of at least seven aircraft stationed on the base; the Russian MoD on 4 January 2018 acknowledged that the attack occurred and confirmed that two servicemen had been killed, but denied that any jets had been disabled.–•–º–µ–π–º–∏–º –ø–æ–ø–∞–ª –ø–æ–¥ –æ–≥–æ–Ω—å: –†–∞–¥–∏–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –∏—Å–ª–∞–º–∏—Å—Ç—ã –æ–±—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª—è–ª–∏ –∏–∑ –º–∏–Ω–æ–º–µ—Ç–æ–≤ —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫—É—é –∞–≤–∏–∞–±–∞–∑—É –≤ –°–∏—Ä–∏–∏ Kommersant, 3 January 2018.

An article on /Drive said that key questions about the attack were still unanswered despite the Russian MoD's communique. On 12 January 2018, the Russian MoD announced the military had eliminated the group of militants that shelled the Khmeimim airbase, close to the western border of Idlib province in a special operation. Furthermore, a terrorist drone assembly and storage depot was destroyed as well in the Syrian province of Idlib.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that four Israeli F-16 fighter jets had attacked targets in Syria's Latakia after approaching from the Mediterranean. The Israeli warplanes had approached at a low altitude and ‚Äúcreated a dangerous situation for other aircraft and vessels in the region.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Israeli pilots used the Russian plane as cover and set it up to be targeted by the Syrian air defense forces.

Drone attacks On 6 January 2018, Russian forces thwarted a drone (UAV) swarm attack on the base, the first of this kind in the history of warfare. Statements from Russia's MoD on 8 and 10 January confirmed earlier reports about the incident, saying that the attempted attack that involved 13 armed, fixed-wing drones which were used to attack both the Hmeimim base and the Tartus naval facility on 5‚Äî6 January was repulsed by the Russian forces' radio-electronic warfare technologies; it also refuted earlier reports that a greater number of UAVs were involved in the attack and alleged that the drones could have been obtained only from a country that possessed \\"high-tech capabilities for providing satellite navigation and remote control.\\"Russia Says 13 Drones Used In Attack On Its Air Base, Naval Facility In Syria Radio Liberty, 8 January 2018.–ü–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–≥–æ–Ω: –∞—Ç–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞–≤—à–∏–µ –±–∞–∑—ã –†–§ –≤ –°–∏—Ä–∏–∏ –±–µ—Å–ø–∏–ª–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥—è—Ç—Å—è –≤ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–∂–µ TASS, 9 January 2018.Reports of 31 drones attacking Russian facilities in Syria untrue, says defense official TASS, 10 January 2018.–ú–∏–Ω–æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã –æ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞–ª–æ –Ω–æ–≤–æ–µ —Ñ–æ—Ç–æ –±–µ—Å–ø–∏–ª–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤, –∞—Ç–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞–≤—à–∏—Ö –•–º–µ–π–º–∏–º RIA Novosti, 10 January 2018.

Vi·ªát Minh leader Ho Chi Minh in 1946 1947‚Äì1950 in French Indochina focuses on events influencing the eventual decision for military intervention by the United States in the First Indochina War. In 1947, France still ruled Indochina as a colonial power, conceding little real political power to Vietnamese nationalists. French Indochina was divided into five protectorates: Cambodia, Laos, Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina. The latter three made up Vietnam. In 1946 a civil war had broken out between the French forces in Vietnam and the Vi·ªát Minh insurgents, led by Ho Chi Minh who had declared independence and the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The objective of the Vi·ªát Minh and other Vietnamese nationalists was full independence from France and unification of the three French protectorates. The Vi·ªát Minh was dominated by communists. Initially the United States had little interest in Vietnam and was equivocal about supporting France, but in 1950, due to an intensification of the Cold War and a fear that communism would prevail in Vietnam, the U.S. began providing financial and military support to French forces. Paralleling the U.S. aid program, Communist China also began in 1950 to supply arms, equipment, and training to the Vi·ªát Minh. Vietnam played an increasingly important role in the worldwide competition between the communist world, headed by the Soviet Union, and the \\"Free World\\" led by the United States. The French suffered severe military defeats in late 1950 which resulted in American military aid being increased to prevent victory by the Vi·ªát Minh. The article titled First Indochina War describes the war between the Vi·ªát Minh and the French in more detail. This article is preceded by 1940‚Äì46 in the Vietnam War and followed by other articles year-by- year. 1947 ; 5 January French Overseas Minister Marius Moutet visiting Vietnam said that the Vi·ªát Minh \\"have fallen to the lowest level or barbarity\\" and that \\"before there is any negotiation it will be necessary to get a military decision.Logevall, Frederik (2012), Embers of War: The Fall of an Empire and the Making of America's Vietnam, New York: Random House, p. 170 ; 30 January American diplomat Abbot Low Moffat told a British diplomat that the French were facing a disaster in their war in Vietnam.Logevall, p. 178 ; 3 February Secretary of State George C. Marshall in a telegram to the American Embassy in Paris criticized France's \\"dangerously outmoded colonial outlook and method\\" but also warned that Vi·ªát Minh leader Ho Chi Minh had \\"direct Communist connections.\\"Spector, Ronald H.

The elections were postponed because of civil disorderThe Pentagon Papers \\"Vietnam and the U.S., 1940‚Äì50\\", p.A-39 ; 8 February France said that 1,855 of its soldiers in the French Far East Expeditionary Corps had been killed or wounded since the beginning of the civil war in December 1946.Logevall, p. 167 ; 15 February French forces had pushed the Vi·ªát Minh out of most major towns and cities in northern and central Vietnam, including Hanoi and Hu·∫ø. Ho Chi Minh maintained his self-proclaimed independent government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Th√°i Nguy√™n, north of Hanoi.Bradley, Mark (1993), \\"An Improbable Opportunity: America and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's 1947 Initiative\\", in The Vietnam War: Vietnamese and American Perspectives; London: M. E. Sharpe, p. 5 ; 13 March √âmile Bollaert became France's High Commissioner for Indochina. His priority was to re-open negotiations with the Vi·ªát Minh.Logevall, p. 189 ; 24 March The Vi·ªát Minh forces near Hanoi were described as having three defense lines. The first was manned by riflemen, the second by soldiers with knives and spears, and the third by men armed with bows and arrows. French military forces in Vietnam totaled 94,000 and 11,000 reinforcements were en route from France. Vi·ªát Minh military forces totaled about 60,000 with another 100,000 part-time fighters and militia.Spector, pp. 85-86 ; 9 April In a diplomatic initiative, Ho had sent diplomat Pham Ngoc Thach to Bangkok, Thailand to seek support from the United States and the American business community. Thach met informally with Lt. Col. William B. Low, the assistant military attach√© of the U.S. Embassy, and responded in writing to a series of questions posed by the Americans. Thach emphasized the nationalistic nature of the struggle against French colonialism. ; 24 April Vi·ªát Minh diplomat Pham Ngoc Thach in Bangkok wrote letters to American companies offering economic concessions if they would invest in Vietnam.Bradley, p. 6 ; 8 May Vi·ªát Minh Foreign Minister Ho√†ng Minh Gi√°m appealed to the U.S. for diplomatic recognition of an independent Vietnam and American economic, political, and cultural assistance.Bradley, p. 7 ; 9 May Secretary of State Marshall refused to allow Vice Consul James L. O'Sullivan to meet with Thach in Bangkok. Marshall cited the opposition of France to contacts with the Vi·ªát Minh as the reason. Thus, the U.S. had rejected Ho Chi Minh's initiative to gain the support on the United States for an independent Vietnam.Bradley, p. 10 ; 12 May Paul Mus, who had lived for many years in Vietnam, met with Ho Chi Minh at the Vi·ªát Minh headquarters in Th√°i Nguy√™n north of Hanoi. Mus proposed a cease fire and a unilateral disarmament by the Vi·ªát Minh. Ho said he would be a coward to accept such terms. This was Ho's last meeting with a representative of the French government.Logevall, p. 192 ; 5 June American Vice Consul O'Sullivan in Hanoi reported to Washington that the destruction in northern Vietnam was \\"appalling.\\" He mostly blamed the Vi·ªát Minh for a scorched earth policy, but also French bombing and shelling.Spector, pp. 86-87 ; 14 July Secretary of State George Marshall asked diplomats in Southeast Asia and Europe their opinion of the Vi·ªát Minh and its government, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The responses from Southeast Asia said that patriotism and nationalism were the basis of the Vi·ªát Minh's popularity and that the Vi·ªát Minh's ties with the Soviet Union were extremely limited. However, from France American diplomats said that Ho Chi Minh \\"maintains close connections in Communist circles\\" and that his government, if it became independent, \\"would immediately be run in accordance with dictates from Moscow.\\"Bradley, pp. 13-14 Vice Consul James O'Sullivan in Hanoi responded by saying, \\"it is curious that the French discovered no communist menace in the Ho Chi Minh government until...it became apparent that the Vietnamese...would not bow to French wishes....Bradley, p. 15 It is further apparent that Ho's support (which French to present have consistently underestimated) derives from [the] fact [that] he represents [the] symbol of fight for independence. He is supported because he is acting like [a] nationalist, not because he was or is Communist.FRUS, 1947, The Far East, Vol. VI, Document 132, accessed 21 Nov 2015 ; 24 September American consuls in Hanoi and Saigon reported to Washington that the French were planning a major military operation against the Vi·ªát Minh. They recommended that the U.S. discourage the French from attempting to reimpose the colonial status quo.Spector, 87 ; 7 October to 8 November The French military operation L√©a in autumn 1947 French General Jean √âtienne Valluy led Operation Lea in an attempt to destroy the Vi·ªát Minh and capture or kill its leaders. 15,000 French troops descended upon Vi·ªát Minh strongholds north of Hanoi. Ho Chi Minh and military leader V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p barely escaped but the French attack bogged down and Operation Lea was a failure.Logevall, pp. 202-203 ; 20 November to 22 December In Operation Ceinture The French renewed their attack on Vi·ªát Minh strongholds north of Hanoi with a 12,000 man army. They succeeded in briefly capturing much of Vi·ªát Minh territory and claimed to have killed 9,500 Vi·ªát Minh, probably including many non-combatants, but did not have the manpower to remain to occupy the area. They withdrew their forces, save a few fortified points.Fall, Bernard B. (1967), Hell in a Very Small Place: the siege of Dien Bien Phu New York: Lippincott, pp. 28-31 ; 7 December The H·∫° Long Bay agreement was reached between the French High Commissioner and former emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i. The French promised independence to northern Vietnam, but within the French Union and with France retaining control over foreign relations and defence and without unifying Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina, the three French protectorates making up Vietnam. The agreement excluded the Vi·ªát Minh from the government. B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i returned to France and remained there for several months after the agreement was signed while the French attempted to persuade him to return to Vietnam.Spector, pp 90-91 1948 ; 2 January American Consul Edwin C. Rendell in Hanoi reported to Washington that the \\"hard core' of Vi·ªát Minh resistance had not been broken by French military offensives. The Vi·ªát Minh were stepping up their raids and attacks on French army posts and military convoys.Spector, pp 89-90 ; 14 January Ho Chi Minh issued a decree forbidding \\"one single word or one single line\\" of criticism of the United States. Ho had not given up on luring the United States to his cause.Logevall, p. 225 ; 8 June B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i finally returned to Vietnam to attend the signing of a new agreement between France and General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Xu√¢n, head of the French- sponsored government of Cochinchina. France recognized the independence of Vietnam within the French Union and endorsed the eventual union of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina into a single state, but France maintained control of defense, foreign affairs, and finances. B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i returned to France after the signing, refusing to return to Vietnam without receiving additional concessions from France. Xuan established his government in Hanoi. The agreement had little public support.Logevall, p. 205; Spector 92 ; 30 June The U.S. position against the Vi·ªát Minh was hardening. The U.S. Consul in Saigon, George M. Abbott, said that a French truce with the Vi·ªát Minh \\"would result in the non-communist elements [in Vietnam] being swallowed up.\\"Spector, p. 92 ; 28 August George Abbott, the U.S. Consul in Saigon, said prompt action was needed by France to grant real independence to a B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i government.Spector, pp. 92-93 ; 27 September The U.S. Department of State said that the policy of maintaining French support for a Western European coalition to contain the Soviet Union took precedence over attempting to persuade France to concede more independence to Vietnamese and end the war.Spector, p 83 The State Department also concluded that \\"we are all too well aware of the unpleasant fact that Communist Ho Chi Minh is the strongest and perhaps the ablest figure in Indochina and that any suggested solution which excludes him is an expedient of uncertain outcome. We are naturally hesitant to press the French too strongly or to become deeply involved so long as we are not in a position to suggest a solution or until we are prepared to accept the onus of intervention.\\"Foreign Relations of the United States, 1948, the Far East and Australia, Volume VI, Washington, D.C.: Department of State, document 33 ; 31 December The French had about 100,000 soldiers in Vietnam. The Vi·ªát Minh had 250,000 full and part-time fighters and controlled more than one-half the population of the country. The Vi·ªát Minh launched frequent attacks on French forces, especially road convoys. In the Saigon area, the French suffered more that 8,000 casualties in 1948 and had suffered more than 30,000 casualties since the beginning of the civil war in 1946.Logevall, pp. 207-210; Spector 96 1949 ; 17 January U.S. Under Secretary of State Robert A. Lovett said the U.S. should not give its full support to the B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i government which existed only because of French military forces in Vietnam.Spector, p. 93 ; 6 March The American Embassy in Paris reported to Washington that the B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i government was \\"the only non-communist solution in sight.\\"Spector, p. 93 ; 8 March France and B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i concluded the √âlys√©e Accords in Paris which created the State of Vietnam. The Accord reaffirmed Vietnamese autonomy and provided for the union of the three French protectorates of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina, but France retained control of the military and foreign affairs. The Accord was denounced by Ho Chi Minh and generated little support in Vietnam. B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i returned to Vietnam as Head of State after the agreement was formally approved by the French parliament.Logevall, pp. 211-212 ; 5 May At a Department of State conference, Consul General George M. Abbott said that the only alternatives to a B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i government were a colonial war or a communist- dominated government of Vietnam.Spector, p. 93 ; 29 August The Soviet Union detonated a nuclear bomb at a test site, breaking the United States' monopoly on nuclear weapons. The Soviet nuclear test amplified fears by the U.S. and its allies that the Soviet Union might undertake more aggressive action to spread communism to additional countries, including Vietnam.Logevall, p. 221 ; 1 October Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The triumph of communism in China, resulted in increased fear by the United States that communism would also triumph in Vietnam and that Vietnam would become a puppet state of China and the Soviet Union.Logevall, p. 212 1950 A map of communist controlled and disputed areas in French Indochina in 1950 ; 14 January A U.S. Department of Defense Committee recommended that the U.S. expend $15 million on military aid to combat communism in Vietnam. Secretary of State Dean Acheson said that U.S. military aid might be \\"the missing component\\" in defeating communist insurgency in Vietnam. Thus, the U.S. was preparing to become financially involved in the conflict in Vietnam.Spector, pp. 100-101 ; 17 January Eight Chinese military advisers left Beijing to travel to North Vietnam and advise and assist the Vi·ªát Minh. They would begin work in March.Xiaobing Li (2007), A History of the Modern Chinese Army, Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, p. 208 ; 18 January Communist China and the Soviet Union extended diplomatic recognition to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as the sole legitimate government authority of all Vietnam.

The trip had taken him nearly a month during which he had walked for 17 days from Vietnam to reach southern China. Chinese leader Mao Zedong was not in Beijing, but Liu Shaoqi promised Chinese assistance to Ho.Logevall, p. 227 ; 7 February Secretary of State Acheson announced U.S. diplomatic recognition of the Vietnamese government of B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i called the State of Vietnam. Acheson promised economic and military aid to France and the B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i government. Thus, the U.S., although long skeptical of the suitability of B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i as a leader and France's colonial rule of Vietnam, came down on the side of both.Spector, p. 96-97; Logevall, p. 229 ; 10 February Ho Chi Minh, after visiting China, arrived in Moscow, Soviet Union. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was distrustful of Ho's communist credentials and declined to provide Soviet aid to the Vi·ªát Minh. Meeting with Mao in Moscow, however, the Chinese leader offered \\"all the military assistance Vietnam needed in its struggle against France.\\"Logevall, pp. 227-228 ; 13 February U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson said that Ho Chi Minh was \\"the mortal enemy of native independence in Indo-China.\\"Spector, p. 96 ; 16 February France officially requested military and economic aid from the United States for Indochina.

Walton Butterworth said economic and military aid to the French and B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i's government of Vietnam were not \\"the missing components\\" in solving the problem of Vietnam. He warned that it would be a \\"dangerous delusion\\" to believe that aid to Vietnam would be as effective as had been American aid to Greece in fending off a communist insurgency.Spector, p. 101 Butterworth would soon be replaced by Dean Rusk. ; 22 February French officials told the American Embassy in Paris that without American aid, they might find it necessary to withdraw from Vietnam.\\" In the words of historian Ronald H.

NSC68 expressed an apocalyptic vision of the \\"design\\" of the Soviet Union to achieve world domination. This view was bolstered by the recent victory of communist forces in China and by domestic fears of communism, especially those aroused by Senator Joseph McCarthy and Congressman Richard Nixon. The report advocated a massive increase of 400 percent in U.S. budgets for an expansion of the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, plus increased military aid to allies.

President Truman had ordered the aid in response to the North Korean attack on South Korea. The prevailing view in the United States was that communism was monolithic and communist activity was coordinated worldwide. Thus, the attack on South Korea caused the U.S. to become more concerned about the Vi·ªát Minh insurgency in Vietnam.Spector, p. 123 Vi·ªát Minh forces were estimated to have grown to 250,000 personnel, including 120,000 in regular units organized into divisions. The remaining troops were regional and popular and primarily concerned with defense and security. An estimated 15,000 Chinese, in both Vietnam and China, assisted the Vi·ªát Minh with training, technicians, and advisers. The French had about 150,000 soldiers in Vietnam.

The team was headed by the Department of State's John F. Melby and Marine Corps general Graves B. Erskine. It was one of the first American missions to Vietnam to assess the struggle of communist insurgents against French colonial rule. The team's assessment of French efforts was very pessimistic and they advised major changes in the French approach, but also recommended providing the military aid France was requesting. Their policy recommendations were neither heeded nor communicated to the French.Irwin M.

Obituary. In 1936 she started the first phase of her career when Gregor Piatigorsky assisted her in getting her first concert appearance as a cellist. In 1940, the impresario Harold Holt often included her as a supporting artist to the tenor Richard Tauber, with whom she toured the country. Tauber wrote for her a Ballade for 'cello and piano which they often played together on the tour. By the time of the second world war she was a member of the Ebsworth Quartet and they would tour factories to entertain the workers, play at the National Gallery and in air-raid shelters. She married Walter Susskind in 1943. After the war she continued to play and to teach. The quartet ended in the 1950s and she joined a trio until a back injury indicated a change of direction. She divorced her husband in 1953. She subsequently worked with the English Chamber Orchestra, the London Mozart Players, the Zorian Quartet and the English Baroque Ensemble. She also took part in film sessions with Malcolm Arnold, Jacques Loussier and Richard Rodney Bennett. She joined the BBC in 1964 and in 1969 she organised a series of broadcasts from a music venue of her own devising. She had identified that the restored St John's Church in Smith Square was an ideal venue for BBC radio concerts. One of its advantages was its distance from traffic noise including underground trains. Each Monday lunchtime the music concerts would be broadcast on BBC Radio until the church was rebuilt.

Design and construction The Class 470 locomotive was one of twelve standard designs developed by the FS right after their institution, and was intended for heavy mountain work. The two extreme axles were given a lateral play of and the central wheels were without flanges, to allow the locomotive to deal even with sharp curves. The boiler was common with that of the FS Class 680, as was the four-cylinder compound Plancher engine, in which the two high pressure (HP) and the two low pressure (LP) cylinders were respectively grouped together, with each pair being served by a single piston valve via a crossed port arrangement. The Class 470 was unusual in its appearance because the coal reserves were carried on board it, on the left side of the fully enclosed cab, while the water was carried by a separate tender; this has led some to define them \\"semi-tank locomotives\\". The Class 470 was built between 1907 and 1911 by Maffei (64 locomotives, 1907‚Äì09), Officine Meccaniche (52, 1908‚Äì11), Ernesto Breda (10, 1909) and Officine Meccaniche e Navali di Napoli (17, 1909‚Äì12), for a total of 143 locomotives. P. M. Kalla-Bishop suggested that the Midland Railway 0-10-0 \\"Lickey Banker\\", which shared with the Class 470 the wheelbase and the crossed port arrangement, may have been inspired by it, as a complete sets of drawings of the Italian locomotive were stored at Derby. Modifications Classes 471 and 472 From 1918 until the 1930s, all but 14 of the Class 470 were rebuilt with a superheater and reclassified as the Class 471 (while keeping their old running numbers, e.g. the 470.018 became 471.018). From 1924 some of the rebuilt locomotives (24 in total) were also given enlarged HP cylinders of diameter, and were initially reclassified as Class 472; from 1930 however these were renumbered in the Class 471 as the subclass 471.2XX. In total, 105 Class 471 and 24 Class 472 locomotives were rebuilt. 109 of the rebuilt 471 and 472 locomotives were also altered from their original semi-tank condition to orthodox tender locomotives, being fitted tenders of the extinct FS Class 290, with a capacity of of coal and of water; later, tenders previously allocated to the FS Class 730, with a capacity of of water, were also fitted to some locomotives. Operation Nicknamed \\"crematorium\\" by their crews (because of the fully enclosed cab, which made the work environment very hot and uncomfortable for the crews), the Class 470 and 471 locomotives served on steep mountain railways throughout Italy for all of their career, with some being assigned to passenger and freight work on important railways such as the Turin-Genoa railway, the Porrettana railway, the Turin-Modane railway and others. However, the Class 470 had the dubious honour of being the first Italian steam locomotive to be displaced from a main line by electrification, as in 1907 work on the Giovi section of the Turin-Genoa railway began, with the first tests ran in June 1910; on the 3.5% (1 in 28¬Ω) steep incline, compared with the Class E.550, the Class 470 was completely outperformed by the smaller and lighter electric locomotive, only managing to pull 170 t at , while the latter managed to pull 190 t at , while eliminating issues such as most physical effort and smoke in tunnels. This meant that major summit lines would be among the first targets for further electrifications, and the Class 470 were gradually relegated to secondary lines.Pedrazzini, p. 61-94 The few unrebuilt Class 470 survived until the early 1960s. The last Class 471 locomotives were withdrawn in the early 1970s from service on the Sulmona-Terni railway. Preservation One Class 470 locomotive survived into preservation, the 470.092, currently preserved as a static exhibit in the Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia \\"Leonardo da Vinci\\" of Milan.

Design and development The DB-20 was an all-metal monoplane with a mixture of steel and duralumin tube frames and duralumin skin. Designed as a ground attack aircraft, it was heavily armoured. An earlier Dyle and Bacalan twin engine design, the DB-10 had a very deep airfoil centre section between the engines which replaced the forward fuselage. The DB-20 refined this layout; on it the section between the engines was again a single structural unit but it became thinner rapidly outwards to the engines. This large structure was built on steel frames and was duralumin skinned; internal dural frames supported armoured sheets which protected the crew from ground fire. Two Gnome-Rh√¥ne Jupiter 9Ad nine cylinder radial engines on the leading edge of the centre section, closely cowled but with cylinder heads exposed, were positioned at the junction between the inner section and two outer panels. These panels were straight tapered, with blunt tips and had a novel internal structure with multiple, converging beams in place of the usual one or two spars; the beams shared flanges formed by variable section boxes which replaced the ribs in forming the airfoil section under a dural skin. Narrow chord ailerons filled almost all the trailing edges outboard of the engines. The rest of the fuselage of the DB-20 came in two parts, each joined to the central section. The foreword section was a conventional flat-sided fuselage with an open nose-gunner's position, equipped with a machine gun on a flexible mounting. Like the centre section it was heavily armoured, with thick walls and a floor providing protection from ground fire at altitudes above The other three crew positions were in the central section, pilot and mechanic sitting side-by-side in an open cockpit at the leading edge and with a mid-upper gunner or observer, who could also drop bombs, close behind them. The rear fuselage section was a large, flat sided duralumin beam with frames and riveted skin. It carried a blunted triangular fin and deep balanced rudder. The DB-20's rectangular, high aspect ratio tailplane was mounted on the fin just above the fuselage, braced to it with V-struts and carrying overhung (balanced) elevators. Its undercarriage was fixed and conventional with two pairs of mainwheels set apart under the engines. They were mounted on vertical V-form struts from the inner sides of the engine mountings and oblique, almost horizontal N-struts from the bottom of the fuselage. The latter were connected to a horizontal box containing the integrated oleo type shock absorbers. Its tailskid had an oil filled shock absorber. The exact date of the first flight of the DB-20 is not known but it was not long before the beginning of October 1929, flown from M√©rignac by Charles Descamps, the Dyle and Bacalan test pilot. First impressions of speed and manoeuvrability were good, though the armour had yet to be fitted. By March 1929, possibly with the armour in place, provisional, unofficial performance figures were well below the theoretical predictions of the previous October, with a speed of and a time to of 13 minutes. On 23 May 1929 the DB-20 was flown from M√©rignac by Descamps, with their technical director L√©tang as passenger, to the government testing centre at Villacoublay. Fuel consumption was higher than anticipated and they had to put down in a field about from their destination. Nonetheless, they arrived safely after about 6 hours from departure. There are no known reports on the outcome of these tests, or indeed on any other later activity of the DB.20.

Probably built about 1880, it is the rural community's best-preserved one-room schoolhouse, and is now maintained by the local historical society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The District No. 5 School House is located in the village of Hermon, north of United States Route 2 at the western corner of Billings Road and School House Lane. It is a single- story wood frame structure, with a front-gable roof and clapboard siding. The gable has applied Stick style woodwork at its peak and ends. The front facade, facing toward Billings Road, has two widely spaced doorways, each topped by a bracketed cornice with a mini-gable. Windows on the side elevations are similarly decorated, where there are paired brackets in the eave. The entrances lead into small vestibules, which provide access to the classroom that occupies most of the rest of the building. The walls are finished in wainscoting below, and plaster above, except for one area that has been reconstructed with wallboard. Local tradition assigns a construction date of 1852 to this building, about the time the town was divided into thirteen school districts. However, architectural evidence suggests a later construction date, c. 1880. It remained in use as a school until 1953, and then sat vacant until the early 1980s, when the local rescue squad adapted it for its use, adding a garage door to the front. This and other alterations were reversed during a restoration of the building in 1988 by the local historical society. The town had six district schools standing when they were closed in 1953; all of the others have been altered or demolished.

On 25 May she arrived at Rogues River,a section of the Hooghly River. On 24 October she was at Calcutta. Outward bound, she was at Rogues River again on 17 November, reaching Benkulen on 9 January 1745.

Background The son of a Dutch publisher and his Scottish wife, Kruyt studied theology at Utrecht and joined the League of Christian Socialists in 1910. Early political career In 1913, he was elected chairman of this party; in 1918, he became its only member of the House of Representatives. In the same period, he worked as a Reformed minister at Gennep. He formed an alliance with Willem van Ravesteyn and David Wijnkoop, the two representatives from the Social Democratic Party and Harm Kolthek the sole representative of the anarchists, Kruyt joined the Communist Party. He stood as a Communist candidate for the 1922 elections, but was not re-elected. Later career Following his wife's death, Kruyt emigrated to Berlin where he joined Workers International Relief, then to Moscow in 1935 (presumably fleeing from the Nazis) to work at the Lenin State Library. Dissatisfied with Stalinism, he trained as a spy in the hopes of getting back to the Netherlands this way. From England, he parachuted into Belgium in June 1942. He broke his leg and was arrested by the German occupiers who detained him at Fort Breendonk. Death Kruyt was tortured and deported to the Moabit prison in Berlin where he is thought to have been executed by firing squad in 1943.

According to John Stow and John Selden, Canon Row ‚Äî or, as it was often called, Channel Row ‚Äî derived its name from being the residence allotted to the Canons of St Stephen's Chapel in the Palace of Westminster. It was anciently the site of several grand townhouses. Stow states that among its inhabitants in his time were \\"divers noblemen and gentlemen,\\" including Sir Edward Hobbes, John Thynne, Esq., Henry Clinton, 2nd Earl of Lincoln, (Lincoln House) and the Earl of Derby (Derby House) and the Duchess of Somerset, mother of the Earl of Hertford, (Hertford House) who both occupied \\"stately\\" houses.Thornbury Also situated on Canon Row was Sussex House, home of Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex.Ros, Maggi, Life in Elizabethan England: A London and Westminster Directory, 2008 The current buildings on the site, including the Canon Row Police Station, date from the early 20th century.https://www.parliament.uk/about/living- heritage/building/northern-estate/normanshaw-parliament-st/ Sources *Thornbury, Walter, Old and New London, Volume 3, London, 1878, pp. 376-382: Whitehall: Precinct and Gardens *Ros, Maggi, Life in Elizabethan England: A London and Westminster Directory, 2008 References Streets in the City of Westminster ","title":"Canon Row"},{"id":"48630752","text":"Edwards Davis (June 17, 1867 ‚Äì May 17, 1936) was an American film actor.Goble p. 102 Partial filmography * De Luxe Annie (1918) * Kildare of Storm (1918) * The Invisible Ray (1920) * The Right Way (1921) * The Plaything of Broadway (1921) * The Sea Hawk (1924) * The Only Woman (1924) * Stolen Secrets (1924) *The Price She Paid (1924) * Her Husband's Secret (1925) * My Neighbor's Wife (1925) * Not So Long Ago (1925) * The Splendid Road (1925) * Flattery (1925) * Tramp, Tramp, Tramp (1926) * Butterflies in the Rain (1926) * The Amateur Gentleman (1926) * The Hero on Horseback (1927) * Face Value (1927) * Singed (1927) * The Life of Riley (1927) * Winds of the Pampas (1927) * Madonna of the Streets (1930) References Bibliography * Goble, Alan.

It was first produced in Shanghai in February 1923, and Hong played the title role. The play strongly opposed the brutal warfare that plagued China at the time, which is now known as the Warlord Era. The play was well received and established Hong Shen's reputation as a playwright. Inception Hong got the inspiration of Yama Zhao in the spring of 1922, shortly after the first battle between two warlords Zhang Zuolin and Wu Peifu. Hong was on a train to northern China when he overheard some soldiers' conversation. They mentioned that Wu's army buried many of Zhang's soldiers alive after winning the battle in order to take possession of their enemies' belongings. This unnerving conversation eventually led Hong to dramatize this incident in Yama Zhao. Plot Set in the Warlord Era, the play tells the tragic story of Zhao Da, a body guard to a commander of a battalion. Zhao is nicknamed Yama Zhao, meaning \\"Zhao, the king of Hell,\\" due to his valor and experience on the battlefield. The commander has not paid members of the entire battalion for five months. Instead, he has pocketed the soldier's salaries and gambled away some of them. Under such circumstance, Zhao, disappointed by his unrewarded service and incited by his fellow soldier Old Li, takes hold of the payroll money and fled into a nearby jungle. He then loses his way and experiences a series of hallucinations before being shot dead by his pursuers. In the end, Li buries Zhao after the rest of the pursuing squad has returned. Li retrieves the money that Zhao has hidden around his waist and flees into the jungle. According to David Y. Chen, the nine scenes of the play can be roughly divided into three parts: \\"the first scene exposes [Zhao Da]'s struggle between duty and wealth which ends in his escape with his booty. The second scene begins with his entering the forest. From this point on, the rest of the play closely resembles the forest section of The Emperor Jones, only in the illusions the past experiences of the Negro convicts are changed for those of the Chinese soldier.\\" Plagiarism controversy Hong's Yama Zhao bears clear a resemblance to Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones by \\"[borrowing] from its American prototypes the money motif, the structure of plot, the scene division, and the psychological treatment of hallucinations in a forest setting.\\" Due to the similarities between Yama Zhao and The Emperor Jones, Hong faced charges of plagiarism from the Chinese literati when his play premiered in Shanghai in 1923. Hong later addressed the controversy in a 1933 article entitled \\"O'Neill and Hong Shen: An Imaginary Conversation (Ouni‚Äôer yu Hong Shen: yidu xiangxiang de duihua).\\" References Works cited  Chinese Republican era plays 1923 plays ","title":"Yama Zhao"},{"id":"48630833","title":"1930 Dahomeyan Administrative Council election"},{"id":"48630836","text":"Rodney Serveux (born 15 June 1990) is a Vanuatuan footballer who plays as a midfielder for Tupuji Imere.

The association is active in all parts of Europe where German is spoken. The association was formed by young adults in late 2000. At first they offered information and a communication platform on their online presence. Since 2002, several real-life meet ups are hosted by the group. With several iterating meet ups in a large number of cities, the SMJG is one of the biggest trans- regional charitable organization concerning BDSM in German-speaking European countries.  History  The name is an acronym which consists of ‚ÄúBDSM & JuGend‚Äù (The German word for youth and shorthand for youth-organization). The name developed from the original name ‚ÄúSadomasochistische Jugendgruppe‚Äù. The SMJG was founded in August 2000 by a 15-year-old, as a reaction to the lack of information regarding BDSM, especially for young people. In the following years the project SMJG grew to be a charitable organization with a wide reach and is an important part of the German-speaking BDSM subculture. The SMJG offers interested young adults and teenagers contact to persons of their own age and detailed information on the topic of BDSM, creating a safe environment to talk about their sexuality. The goal of the organization is to be an venue for the sexually curious and the prevention of possible accidents during play sessions by setting a focus on education and risk- prevention.https://www.smjg.org/ueber-uns/vereinsgeschichte/ last visited at 27.10.2015  Work  The group organizes regular munches in 37 German and 3 Austrian cities, exclusively for teenagers and young adults. In addition to the monthly meetups, the SMJG also offers a mailing list, an online forum, and a moderated IRC channel. The forum in particular provides a communication network for interested young adults in which they can discuss the subject within the safety of their peer group. Additionally the homepage offers detailed information on potential risks and advice on safety in the context of BDSM and sexuality, as well as help with other youth-specific topics, such as \\"coming out\\" and \\"BDSM and parents\\". These services are open to every person of every gender and sexuality, but there is a strict age limit of 27. The SMJG is also present at fairs and street festivals like the ‚ÄúChristopher Street Day‚Äù for outreach and the dispelling of misconceptions about the group.  Controversy  In 2012 jugendschutz.net approached SMJG.org with a request to add measures for the protection of minors to the official Forum, threatening to start an inquiry with the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons. To prevent the unnecessary risk of being added to the index of media harmful to minors, the articles in question were only made available at certain times of the day. Within the German BDSM scene and the SMJG in particular, this was perceived as dangerous, as it restricts access to vital information needed when attempting more difficult types of \\"play\\", potentially threatening minors who can not get this information from anywhere else.ZEIT Online: Ich ‚Äì bizarr und unnormal.

The main functions of the park administration are to provide protection and conserve the flora and fauna of the park concurrently supporting the interests of the 50 nomadic communities, and achieving conservation of the linked historic monuments; and also to encourage eco-tourism. For the endangered wild goat (Capra aegagrus) the park is the only intact habitat. To protect this species from poaching and enable its viewing in the park by visitors, the Centre for Biodiversity Conservation & Research (NACRES), an IUCN member, carried out a pilot project titled \\"viewing potential\\" by monitoring the \\"risks and benefits to conservation and the cost of setting up and operation of wildlife viewing trails.\\" The local partners associated with this study were Tusheti Guide and Friends of Tusheti Protected Areas. A wild goat monitoring scheme was established, and local guides, park rangers and local groups were trained to ensure protection to the wild goat. The project has proved successful as more visitors could view the goat now, and NACRES is continuing its support.  Fauna  In Tusheti National Park, there are seven mammals, ten birds and one fish which are on the Georgia Red List.Biodiversity of Tusheti Protected areas Mammals are represented by otter, brown bear, wild goat, tur, deer and barbastelle. Birds, including some rare species, are common in the park.

Farragut Houses is a property of New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA). The houses contain 3,272 residents who reside in ten buildings that are each 13 to 14 stories high. History Front view The Farragut Houses are located in what used to be a heavily industrial area, near the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The site was occupied by 341 lots by 1941, of which 27 were vacant. Of the 314 lots that were extant, 198 consisted of wood structures.Downtown Brooklyn Neighborhood Study. Rep. New York City: Mayor's Committee on Property Improvement, 1941. Wooden buildings were rarely built after the Great Fire of New York in 1835, and brick became the popular building material around the 1870s, so these structures were likely more than a century old.Wilson, Rufus Rockwell (1902). New York: Old & New: Its Story, Streets, and Landmarks. J. B. Lippincott. p. 354. The land for Farragut Houses was cleared starting in 1945. Prior to demolition, there was still an active neighborhood, with 144 stores that were occupied and 30 unoccupied, as well as 677 apartments, 33 one-family dwellings, and 61 two-family dwellings whose occupants needed to be relocated. There were a total of approximately 970 families to be relocated. In 1949 the state approved the Farragut Housing projects fund for $15,087,000. The estimated rental price per room at that time was $5.82. The first residents started moving in that year; the average rent was between $33.50‚Äì$44 a month, including utilities. The three superblocks of the development were completed by 1952. The area consisted of 18 smaller blocks divided by roads and small alleyways. Eight streets‚ÄîTalman Street, Charles Street, High Street, Prospect Street, Dixon Place, Fern Place and Greene Lane‚Äîwere destroyed by the joining of these smaller blocks when demolition started in 1945. Hudson Avenue was cut off between Front and York Street and diverted over to Navy Street. During wartime, the region was filled with sailors. Restaurants, illegal drinking establishments, tattoo parlors and brothels were packed with people who worked or commuted along the waterfront. Dirty and narrow streets provided a haven for derelict behavior. The Farragut Houses were built during a moment of industrial and economic growth, and the surrounding area contains infrastructure of this time of industrial development: waterfront piers, warehouses, industrial buildings, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, and the confluence of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges in nearby Dumbo. The Brooklyn Navy Yard and other industries in Brooklyn declined after World War II and then closed in the mid-1960s, contributing to economic decline in the borough as a whole.Snyder-Grenier, Ellen M. Brooklyn!: An Illustrated History. Philadelphia: Temple UP, 1996. Demographics According to NYCHA, the Farragut Houses housing project has 1,390 apartments and 3,440 residents living in ten 13- and 14-story buildings in Vinegar Hill, within Brooklyn Community Board 2. The density of the population in Farragut Houses was in 2013, and the Farragut Houses' total population in 2013 was 13,954. In 2003 the density of the population in Farragut Houses was , compared to in 2010 and in 2000. Social problems Crime The Farragut Houses are patrolled by the 84th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 301 Gold Street. The 84th Precinct ranked 60th-safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. This was attributed to a high rate of property crimes in the neighborhood. The 84th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 82.3% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 2 murders, 18 rapes, 147 robberies, 184 felony assaults, 126 burglaries, 650 grand larcenies, and 31 grand larcenies auto in 2018. Based on an incarceration map from 2009, which shows the blocks and neighborhoods of Brooklyn and the prison expenditures for those respective areas, the Farragut Housing area has a prison expenditure of around $500,000‚Äì$750,000. These prison expenditures are the costs of incarcerating residents of that specific area. This range is lower than other neighborhoods in Community Board 3, some of which have prison expenditures and exceeding $1,000,000. In 2014, as part of security measures being undertaken in NYCHA properties around the city, NYCHA installed security cameras in eleven high-crime housing projects around Brooklyn, including the Farragut Houses. NYCHA has taken precautions to protect their residents, and the New York City Police Department Housing Bureau offers many programs and initiatives, which train residents to be vigilant and actively stop criminal activity around them. These also teach youth to consider law enforcement as a career goal and instilling a sense of morals. The Resident Watch program, which has spanned for 40 years, allows residents to take initiative on stopping crime, and is active in four of ten buildings. Poverty and social isolation The Farragut Houses are separated from the rest of Brooklyn by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, making the area relatively hard to access from the south. The poverty-stricken area stands in sharp contrast to nearby blocks in Dumbo and Vinegar Hill, where the median income is $148,611, rents average around $3,000 a month, and apartments can sell for over one million dollars. The average Farragut Houses family, by contrast, makes $21,000 annually. Eighty-eight percent of public school students in the area live below the poverty line, and crime in the Farragut Houses is significantly higher than in Dumbo and Vinegar Hill. There are a lack of affordable healthy food options in the area, making the area a food desert. Options include a Chinese restaurant, some bodegas, and a \\"small grocery store with a single aisle of produce.\\" A proposed supermarket, which had been in planning since 2010, had not been built . From 2008 until 2015, the housing project did not have a laundry room in any of the buildings, so residents had to walk at least to go to one of two laundromats along Myrtle Avenue. In 2010, the administration of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed to revitalize Admiral's Row, a run-down block of Second Empire-style houses in the Navy Yard; however, the project was delayed after two developers severed connections with the projects. Admiral's Row was later demolished and a Wegmans supermarket was being built on the site. Wegmans opened on October 27, 2019 and serves the Farragut Houses. Transportation Bus stop at Gold and Sands Streets The Farragut Houses are served by the New York City Subway, with the stopping at York Street away and the stopping at High Street. The nearby Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech complex is served by the . The housing project is also served by four bus routes: the , and , all of which run right through the housing project. All of these routes also go to downtown Brooklyn and connect with the Jay Street complex. In contrast to other places, subway service to the Farragut Houses area has declined over the decades.1924 BMT Subway-Elevated Map1937 IND Map1951 Route Map In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the neighborhood was served by elevated lines and trolleys. The first elevated railway, the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, came to downtown Brooklyn in 1885 and ran only a few blocks away. The station at Lawrence Street (now Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech) opened on June 11, 1924. High Street opened on June 24, 1933, and York Street on April 9, 1936. A trolley ran on Sands, Jay, and Hudson Streets, very close to the site of Farragut Houses, although the last trolley cars were retired on March 4, 1951, the same year the Farragut Houses opened, and the last trolley bus ran on Flushing Avenue to High Street on July 27, 1960. As late as 1951 the Myrtle Avenue El still existed, stopping at Navy Street and Myrtle Avenue, about three blocks from the current site of the Farragut Houses, as it had since the 1880s.1951 Route Map, 1951 Route Map (Bottom Half - Brooklyn, lower Manhattan) Education According to the NYC Department of Education, five out of the 10 Farragut Houses buildings are zoned for P.S. 307 Daniel Hale Williams (K307), while two buildings are zoned for P.S. 287 Bailey K. Ashford (K287) and three buildings are zoned for P.S. 8 Robert Fulton (K008). , the NYC Department of Education proposed a rezoning of the area, which was controversial among residents in adjacent, more affluent Vinegar Hill. After the rezoning was passed, the feedback from many parents was mostly positive and supportive. Elementary schools include: * Community Roots Charter School (Saint Edwards Street, Third Floor) * P.S 307 Daniel Hale Williams (209 York Street) * P.S 8 Robert Fulton (37 Hicks Street) Middle schools include: * Satellite West Middle School (209 York Street) * Community Roots Middle School (50 Navy Street, Third Floor) Religion Church of the Open Door The Church of the Open Door, which started construction in 1953, was the first house of worship to be opened within a NYCHA development. Infrastructure Technology NYCHA is modernizing the Farragut Houses and other NYCHA properties using a program called NextGen NYCHA. There is a MyNYCHA program called \\"The Digital Van\\" funded by a Broadband Technology Opportunities Program grant from the United States Department of Commerce; the vans, which are equipped with eight laptops and are available Monday through Friday 10 a.m to 4 p.m., enable residents to use the vans to access the internet. Another app, called the My NYCHA App, allows residents to receive information on service outages, report damages, and request emergency assistance. Water pipes Map of water pipes The old City of Brooklyn had many water reservoirs. Before the housing project was built, the water was distributed by 36 cast iron main aqueduct pipe to cast iron branch pipes to the neighborhoods until 1900.G.M. Hopkins, C.E., F.Bourquin‚Äôs Steam Lithographic Press, ‚ÄúAtlas of The City of Brooklyn‚Äù Vol.1; 1880; Brooklyn Collection, The Brooklyn Central Public Library. The branch pipes replaced cast iron pipes in the early 1900s.Hugo Ullitz, C.E, E. Belcher Hyde, Inc., ‚ÄúDesk Atlas of the Borough of Brooklyn City of New York‚Äù Vol.1; 1903; Brooklyn Collection, The Brooklyn Public Library.E. Robinson C.E, R.H. Pigeon, C.E, E. Belcher Hyde, Inc., ‚ÄúDesk Atlas of the Borough of Brooklyn City of New York‚Äù Vol.1; 1920; Brooklyn Collection, The Brooklyn Public Library. As the population of the neighborhoods kept increasing, the demand for a larger supply of water increased. The increase in population throughout Brooklyn and the soon-to-be other boroughs also caused a problem with the water supply, as the wellwater became polluted and there was an insufficient supply of water. This caused many health problems as there were only a few sources of water. In response, the city began to create a system of water pipes that flowed through the city, as well as outsourced fresh water supplies outside the city. The New York City water system is managed by the Department of Environmental Protection and consists of three upstate aqueducts‚Äîthe Croton, Catskill, and Delaware aqueducts‚Äîthe latter two of which flow through Brooklyn. Farragut Houses currently uses a more modern water pipe system. The New York City Department of Environmental Protection regulates Farragut Houses' water system and its pipes. Each building has its own water piping system and all buildings share three back up water storage tanks in cases of emergencies such as water outages and storms. Maintenance NYCHA's job is to create public housing for low income families while also giving them free maintenance, cleaning and heating. Residents of the Farragut Houses have made a large number of complaints and maintenance repair requests, especially during winter. The reason for increased winter complaints is that the outdated buildings are causing problems with piping and heating, causing harsh living conditions for residents. For instance, on August 16, 2013, the Farragut Houses had 4,034 unanswered repair requests, with complaints ranging from difficulties closing doors to mold growing in bathrooms. In response, Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled proposals to fix these problems. However, at the same time, De Blasio planned to also cut NYCHA's budget.  Community garden  Vinegar Hill Community Garden Vinegar Hill Community Garden, located on York Street, was built as part of the Gardens for Healthy Communities program in 2013. The garden includes more than ten raised beds for growing vegetables, a rainwater harvesting system, shed, and seating. Members of the community and students from nearby PS 307 work in the garden.

She was also the director of the Gmelin Institute of Inorganic Chemistry of the Max Planck Society that edited the Gmelins Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie. She studied Chemistry in Halle (Saale) and Munich, and she finished her doctorate and habilitation at the University of Halle. For her research on the chemistry of main-group elements, she was awarded Alfred Stock Memorial Prize. One of her most notable contributions to inorganic chemistry was her work on the synthesis and structure of poly(sulfur nitride), which was later discovered to be the first non-metallic superconductor. For her success in editing the Gmelins Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie, she received the Gmelin-Beilstein memorial coin.  Life  Becke-Goehring finished her Abitur in Erfurt in 1933. She studied Chemistry in Halle (Saale) and Munich. She completed her doctorate in 1938. In 1944, she finished her habilitation at the institute of Karl Ziegler at the University of Halle. After the Second World War, Becke-Goehring was evacuated by the American military government to the American occupation zone. In 1946, she started as a lecturer for inorganic chemistry at the Heidelberg University. Due to the destruction after the second world war, she had to write her first lecture notes based on her memory and test experiments in the chemistry laboratory. In 1947, she became an extraordinary professor, and was promoted to full professor in 1959. Among her doctoral students were Lieselotte Feikes and Rolf Appel. From 1966 to 1969, she was the first female rector of a university in West Germany . She helped initiate a predecessor of BAF√∂G, a law that regulates state support for the education of students in Germany. The German student movement of 1968 occurred during her time as a rector. As a rector, she forbade Horst Mahler who was involved in the German student movement, from speaking at the university. The movement and the resulting riots largely stopped the university reforms that she had initiated to deal with the financial problems and defects in buildings in the first years of increased student enrollment. A university committee developed a new basic constitution of the university that disagreed with Becke-Goehring's views on free, non-politicizable teaching and research. Following this change, she stepped down as a rector, resigned as a civil servant and left the university in 1969. In the same year, she became the director of the Gmelin Institute for Inorganic Chemistry of the Max Planck Society in Frankfurt where she was responsible for the Gmelin Handbuch. She stayed as its director until her retirement in 1979. She was also chairwoman of the scientific council of the Max Planck Society, a member of the board of management of the Society of German Chemists, and a member of the supervisory board of the Bayer AG. She was married to the industrial chemist Dr. Friedrich Becke.  Research  Initially publishing under the name Goehring and later Becke-Goehring, she researched the chemistry of the main-group elements. Her initial work focused on sulphuric oxygen acids and sulphur halides. Later, she was particularly interested in sulphur-nitrogen and phosphorus-nitrogen compounds. Her work on tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4) started decades of research on this unusual and highly reactive inorganic heterocycle.Margot Goehring \\"√úber den Schwefelstickstoff N4S4 Chemische Berichte 1947, Volume 80, pages 110‚Äì122. She was also able to determine the structure and chemistry of poly(sulfur nitride) which later turned out to be the first non-metallic superconductor. Furthermore, she worked on eight-membered ring systems (e.g. heptasulfur imide S7NHMargot Goehring, Hans Herb, Werner Koch \\"√ºber Das Heptaschwefelimid, S7NH\\" Zeitschrift f√ºr anorganische und allgemeine Chemie 1951, Volume 264, pages 137‚Äì143. and N4S4F4), on six-membered rings (e.g. N3S3X3 (X=F,Cl) and N3[S(O)Cl]), and on ring systems involving sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen atoms as well as sulfur, nitrogen and carbon atoms. Extensive investigations were also carried out on the reactions of PCl5 to phosphorus nitride chlorides (e.g. P3NCl12), whereby several intermediate stages could be isolated and characterized. In addition, she investigated phosphorus sulphides and other phosphorus sulphur compounds in the 1970s.

Recognition For her research in inorganic chemistry, she received the Alfred Stock Memorial Prize in 1961. Due to her accomplishments, she was also a member of three academies of sciences: the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities. She also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Stuttgart. For her work on the Gmelins Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie, she was awarded the Gmelin-Beilsteil Memorial Coin in 1980. In 2017, the Heidelberg University started a lecture series in her remembrance.

The idea was first developed in the Netherlands by the independent media producer by Michele Ernsting and Michelle Chakkalackal at RNW Media. It has been referred to as a freedom of speech program. Its current target countries are Kenya, Uganda, China, Egypt, Mexico, Venezuela and India. The platform was originally launched in India (headed by Vithika Yadav), before expanding rapidly to Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and China. Love Matters works mainly online via its own websites and social media channels. In each region, it provides the same delivery method, but the content and language are tailored to each target market. It seeks to bridge the gap in sexual reproductive health information between young people, sexual health experts, educators and services. The concept has been honored by the World Association for Sexual Health and is also mentioned in the United Nations manifesto on reproductive health. History The first Love Matters platform was launched in November 2010 in Netherlands, and then subsequently launched in India in 2011India. This was following the banning of sexual education in a number of regions in India in the years prior to this. RNW Media launched the idea after seeing problems globally with sex education. The coverage in India gave them a platform to launch the idea, with them launching Love Matters India in late 2011. The idea came following decades of work by RNW Media, using shortwave radio. The Dutch media group partnered with a number of local institutions, including the Indira Gandhi National Open University for Love Matters. The exact strategy for the launch was created following a survey they carried out with young Indian citizens in Delhi and Mumbai. Originally the platform was launched as a website, with the focus shifting to mobile css- styled websites after the survey's results clearly stated that their target market of young people wanted to access the information predominantly on their mobile phones. Love Matters second launch was in South America in 2011, with ‚ÄúHablemos de Amor‚Äù, which translates as Let‚Äôs talk about Love. The region and name were later redefined, with the Latin American version of the platform focusing on three areas, Venezuela, Mexico and Cuba. The title was also changed to Hablemos de Sexo y Amor, to include sex in the title, a bid to make the platform more popular amongst men. The next step for the platform was to move to Kenya, where it went live in 2012. As part of the launch, Kenyan newspaper The Star, launched a weekly feature and an advice column, talking about common relationship issues. In 2013, Love Matters took the decision to expand to China, where it is commonly taboo for people to openly talk about sex and sexual problems. This has contributed to the increase in teenage pregnancy in the country. When Love Matters and their partners in China carried out a survey in Beijing, it found that 47% of the young people had never received formal sex education. Of the 47%, nearly two thirds of them wanted to have access to more information. After the success of the platform in various regions, it was expanded to the Middle East. The platform aims to tackle many taboos within Middle Eastern culture,which in general doesn't offer sex education within schools. Al Hubb Thaqafa, which can be translated to love is culture, is predominantly managed and run by Middle Eastern women. While Love Matters approach goes against many traditional views in countries such as Iran, Pakistan and Egypt, it has been accepted by many as a social tool for sex education, especially for females in the region. Content Love Matters India works locally with many institutions to help promote the platform to local people. It is a sex-positive platform, meaning it refuses to be censored by religion or taboos. On that particular platform, visitors post blogs and queries, which are answered by the fictitious person Auntyji. The figure is aimed to provide a motherly figure for younger individuals, based on the relationship between elders and young adults in Indian culture. The framework of the site is to answer many general questions that Indians may have, while also providing tools such as an encyclopaedia of sex terms to promote self-learning. Other information and medical coverage is also displayed on many of the platforms, including information on HIV and AIDS. In regions such as Kenya, Love Matters has also distributed content using the existing media channels. From 2012 onwards, the platform partnered with The Star in Kenya, to write on a weekly basis about common relationship problems. Locations Love Matters operates regionally, creating targeted content, dependent on what is required for that given target region. The earliest launch was in India, with other locations such as Kenya soon following. Other major regional platforms have included Latin America, China and the Middle East. Coverage The Love Matters concept received recognition in 2013 from the World Association for Sexual Health, following its expansion to various locations globally. After receiving the award, a member of the awarding panel stated in an interview that he believed Love Matter carried out ‚Äúinnovative work in reaching a large number of young people in challenging settings.‚Äù In recent times, Love Matters was mentioned by the United Nations as part of their advice manifesto for their guidelines on reproductive health.

Because of the Iroquois practice of reckoning descent through the female line the family is known as \\"Montour\\" after the matriarch. Madam Montour Madam Montour (1667‚Äìc.1753). Information on Madam Montour is fragmentary and contradictory. Even her given name is uncertain. According to her own account: Current research indicates that she was born √âlisabeth (or Isabelle) Couc around 1667, in Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec, the daughter of Pierre Couc and Marie Mitouamegoukoue, an Algonquin. She was apparently married three times, the last to an Oneida named Carondawanna (Karontow√°:nen‚ÄîBig Tree), who later took the name \\"Robert Hunter\\" after the Governor of New York whom he met at the Albany Conference of 1711. By Carondawanna Madam Montour had at least several children: * Andrew (Sattelihu) * Margaret, known as French Margaret * a daughter, who may have been named Catherine * Lewis (Tau-weson) * Henry (most sources say Henry and Andrew were the same person: \\"Andrew Montour who by the name of Henry Montour,\\"‚Äîfrom his land grant) Her husband was killed about 1729 in battle with the Catawba; after the death of her husband the family moved to Otstonwakin, on the Lawi-sahquick (Loyalsock Creek), now Montoursville, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. She served as interpreter on several occasions, notably Albany in 1711, and Philadelphia in 1727. Her skills were highly valued such that in 1719 the Commissioners for Indian Affairs in Albany decreed that she should receive \\"a man's pay.\\" Andrew Montour Andrew Montour (c. 1720‚Äì1772) was the eldest son of Madam Montour. He was commissioned a captain by the British in 1754 during the French and Indian War. Later he commanded of a raiding party in Ohio in 1764 during Pontiac's Rebellion (1763-1766). He was granted land in Pennsylvania by the colonial government. He married Sally Ainse. His son John served on the side of the colonists in the American Revolution. Another son, Nicholas, became a wealthy businessman and landowner in Canada. Margaret Montour Margaret Montour, (1690‚Äì) also known as French Margaret, the eldest daughter (some say niece)) of Madam Montour, was married to an Iroquois named Katarioniecha (Peter Quebeck), a Mohawk. They resided at a village called on a 1759 map \\"French Margaret's Town\\" (Wenschpochkechung), on the west branch of the Susquehanna at the mouth of Lycoming Creek (now Williamsport, Pennsylvania). The couple had at least five children: * Catherine (French Catherine) * Esther (Queen Esther) * Nicholas * a son who was killed about 1753 fighting the Creeks * Mary, or Molly. Like her mother Margaret attended treaty conferences and often interpreted. Lewis Montour Lewis Montour, the son of Madam Montour, was killed during the French and Indian War. Catherine Montour Shequaga Falls in the present-day village of Montour Falls, New York near the site of Catherine's Town Catherine Mountour (1710‚Äìc.1780) was the daughter of French Margaret. She married Thomas Huston or Hudson (Telenemut). Their children were Roland, John, Amochol(son), and Belle. Catherine died c. 1780-81 Her home was a large village at the head of Seneca Lake, New York called Shequaga, or Catherine's Town. Esther Montour Esther Montour, (c.1720‚Äì) called Queen Esther, was the eldest daughter of French Margaret. She married Echogohund, chief of the Munsee Delawares, and became their leader following his death. Her home was at Sheshequin (now Ulster Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania). During the American Revolution she is reported to have led a war party at the Battle of Wyoming in 1778. According to some sources, enraged by the death of her son on the previous day, she participated in the torture and murder of thirty or so of the enemy; as one puts it \\"she was the most infuriated demon in that carnival of blood.\\" Others dispute this, saying either that reports of atrocities were propaganda, or that Esther did not participate. According to one story she was killed by Thomas Hartley later that year, although other sources state that she died around the year 1800 on Cayuga Lake in New York. Mary Montour Mary Montour was the daughter of French Margaret Mountour. She married Kanaghragait (John Cook), called \\"The White Mingo\\" (died 1790). Mary was baptized in Philadelphia by a Catholic priest. In 1791, on the removal of the Moravian mission from New Salem (Petquotting) to Canada, Mary accompanied them. She was fluent in \\"English, French, Mohawk (her mother tongue), Wyandot [Huron], Ottawa, Chippewa, Shawnese, and Delaware.\\" Roland Montour Monument traditionally thought to mark the burial place of Roland Montour, Painted Post, New York Roland Montour, also spelled Rowland, was the eldest son of Catherine Montour. He was married to a daughter of the Seneca chief Sayenqueraghta, known as \\"Old King\\" or \\"Old Smoke,\\" by his Cayuga wife. He was active in the American Revolution on the British side. He participated in the raid that captured Benjamin Gilbert. He is reputed to have died in September, 1780 in Painted Post, New York of wounds received in the Sugarloaf Massacre at Little Nescopeck Creek, Pennsylvania. However sources say he lived for several years after the massacre. John Montour John Montour(\\"Stuttering John\\")(‚Äìc.1830) was the son of Catherine Montour, the younger brother of Roland. He died about 1830 at Big Tree, New York. John Montour John Montour (1744‚Äì1788) was the son of Andrew Montour and the granddaughter of the Delaware chief Sassoonam. John fought on the British side in the American Revolution until 1778, when he was imprisoned in Detroit by Henry Hamilton for helping some prisoners escape. After this he switched sides and supported the Colonists. Simplified family tree Many details are unclear and contradictory.

Early life Seymour was born in Moline, Illinois on January 3, 1859. Before the age of five he caught scarlet fever, which left him with permanent hearing loss. This condition has been attributed to his early interest in plants and interest in becoming a naturalist. He attended Illinois University and studied botany as an undergraduate from 1878‚Äì1881. While working on his degree, he researched under the tutelage of Thomas J. Burrill, assisting in his study of the parasitic fungi of Illinois. Early career Seymour spent his first two years following graduation at the Illinois State Laboratory of Natural History which was spent surveying and indexing rusts from Illinois, during which he discovered new rust species. The results of his findings were published in Parasitic Fungi of Illinois. Part I (Uredineae) and Part II (Erysipheae). It was at this time when he met Franklin Sumner Earle, whom he collaborated with over the course of his career. He then relocated to Harvard University working as an assistant to William Gilson Farlow from 1883 until 1885, including a period they spent at Cambridge. During this time he also assisted Burrill and Earle on several mycological field collections. He spent the next year at the University of Wisconsin teaching general botany courses. Harvard Cryptogamic Herbarium In 1886 Seymour married Anna Julia Conkling with which he would have four children: Mary Elizabeth, Rosa Margaret, Frank Conkling, and Edith Katharine. He also received his Masters of Science degree from Illinois University and returned to pursue what has been described as his life‚Äôs work at the Harvard Cryptogamic Herbarium. Again working with Farlow, he began organizing and detailing the collection from its early stages into the time it became internationally renowned. He also spent a significant amount of his time cataloging American mycological references when the field was in a state of rapid growth. He and Farlow collaborated on A Provisional Host Index of the Fungi of the United States Part I (1888), Part II (1890), and Part III (1891). Seymour followed other pursuits during this period. He and Earle released Economic Fungi, which illustrated horticultural and weedy plants infected with fungi for easier diagnoses, and totalled eleven fascicles between 1890 and 1899. He also had a passion for natural science education, donating specimens and service to both schools and universities. He also continued lecturing on a part-time basis, both a mycology course at Cambridge and a botany course at Radcliffe College. Late life and death Seymour‚Äôs the Host Index of the Fungi of North America was published in 1929, which contained over 80,000 parasitic fungi and their hosts, almost four times as many as the Provisional Host Index series. He continued working on the Harvard Mycological Indexes until shortly before his death. On March 29, 1933, he succumbed to heart complications after several weeks of illness in Waverley, Massachusetts. Notable publications 1883\\\\. Puccinia heterospora, B. & C.

The church is ethnically and linguistically diverse, reflecting the demographics of its surrounding area, as it draws considerable numbers of Caribbean, Southeast Asian, African, and Italian parishioners. As of 2013, the church served around 1,200 families and educated 380 children in grades four through seven in religious education programs.  History  The Church of the Holy Family was founded in 1913 as an independent parish in response to overcrowding at St. Gabriel's Church and a growing Catholic population of Irish and Germans in the North End of New Rochelle, which was then predominantly farmland. At the time of its establishment, the church had no dedicated physical structure. The inaugural pastor, Fr. Andrew Roche, celebrated mass in a former butcher shop and lived at the College of New Rochelle, traveling back and forth by foot. In 1915, construction on a dedicated church building began and was completed by 1916. The church was dedicated in 1917. The first mass celebrated in the new building was a midnight Christmas mass, as prior to that, masses were being held in the basement of the building under construction. The Holy Family School was opened in 1921 for first and second grade students in the basement of the church, with pews used to form a makeshift classroom. Students were taught by Dominican Sisters. A purpose-built school was opened in 1922 above the church with eight classrooms and was gradually expanded as enrollment increased. The 1970s saw the Holy Family School reach its highest enrollment of approximately 900 students. Thereafter, student enrollment declined and the school was closed in 2005.

Potters was the first permanent holiday camp in the United Kingdom, opening its doors for the first time in 1920. Nearly a century on and through four generations of the Potter Family, it remains the last privately owned holiday village of its kind and in 2002, became the first to receive the English Tourist Board's five star award for holiday villages, since held for 16 consecutive years.http://www.visitnorwich.co.uk/assets/Uploads/Press- Releases-2015/January-Potters-retains-5-star-rating.pdf Potters Resort is the venue for the annual World Indoor Bowls Championships.https://www.pottersholidays.com/world-bowls  History  In 1913, solicitors' clerk Herbert Potter won ¬£500 in a Sunday Chronicle newspaper competition. Inspired by the friendly camaraderie he enjoyed himself when visiting holiday camps with tents, he made plans to build his own. He was called up to serve in World War I and after surviving the trenches and the Battle of the Somme, he returned and purchased land in nearby Hemsby which was the original site of the first permanent and mixed use holiday camp in the UK. Herbert and his brother Arthur Potter opened in 1920 with wooden huts as standard. Upon moving down the coast to bare land in Hopton-on-Sea in 1924, the original Hemsby site was sold. The proceeds were split with Arthur moving to Cornwall, himself establishing Duporth Holiday Camp. Potters remained in its new location by the railway line in Hopton-on-Sea for 10 years, run by Herbert and his wife Edith. During this pioneering decade, many other holiday camps were established along the Norfolk and Suffolk coast, a total of 14 within a 10-mile radius of Hopton-on-Sea, five of which were in the village itself. In 1934, Herbert left the operation of the camp to his daughter Rosa and her new husband, Lesley Groom. Groom, the local policeman, having purchased a third site from Mr Colman who himself operated a successful mustard business. This third plot was in a seaside location as was becoming the trend. Herbert Potter promoted both sites at this time, although the camp located at the railway was later renamed 'Grooms'. The seaside camp known then as Hopton Beach Camp and operated by Herbert and son Hector Potter, is where Potters Resort currently remains. During World War II many holiday camps were requisitioned by the army and the buildings and huts at Potters were mostly dismantled for firewood to keep soldiers warm in the winter. Following the war many of those pioneering families were unable to reopen their holiday camps. Herbert, along with son Hector and his wife Vera, set about rebuilding the camp. Their son Brian was a small child at the time, born shortly before the war began in 1940. In the celebratory period following the war, there was a resurgence in British seaside holidays. Potters once again became a thriving holiday camp having re-invested in its facilities, including building one of the first outdoor swimming pools on the east coast in 1958. Its success was challenged again in the 1960s by the overseas package holiday, during which time many remaining holiday camps closed in the face of stiff competition from sunnier alternatives. With Brian Potter becoming more involved in the family business with partner Judy, Potters again re-invested, creating more indoor facilities to counteract the challenges of the British weather. During this time, fourth generation Jane and John were born to Brian and Judy Potter in 1967 and 1969 respectively, their names chosen via guest votes. In the 1970s and 1980s cheaper, self-catering holidays emerged, one of the first being Hopton Holiday Village. During this wave of competitive new business models, Potters redefined its offerings. Throughout this third generation, led by Brian and Judy Potter, that the resort grew from a seasonal, family holiday camp to a unique leisure resort with shows and cabaret style entertainment nightly, with inclusive meals, daytime entertainment and a range of leisure and sports facilities. Remaining chalets had been replaced by brick bungalows, the outdoor swimming pool became an indoor health and fitness club, a new entrance and reception area was created along with a large sports hall. Professional entertainment was heavily invested in, offering a unique selling point and allowing Potters to expand their season. Despite the resort's first ever weekend break falling upon the great storm of 1987 with guests having to be moved to neighbouring sites due to maintenance issues, further breaks were added to the calendar and ongoing investment continued. In 1993, the Bowlers Bar was built along with six indoor bowls rinks, in addition to the two original rinks built in the 1980s. Ten Pin bowling was added in 1994. Between 1996 and 1998 the resort's main facilities were changed for the long term future. The Bamboo Bar was razed and replaced by the Terrace Bar, The Gallery Lounge and International Arena (with a further six bowls rinks). During the resort's closed period in 1996 and 1997 respectively, the old theatre and restaurant were demolished, replaced by the Atlas Theatre in 14 weeks, and the Garden Restaurant in 12 weeks. The sport of bowls became a key part of Potters' year-round success, with thousands of retired holidaymakers enjoying the combination of this social sport whilst holidaying in the typically quieter seasons.http://www.eadt.co.uk/ea- life/hopton_on_sea_bowls_success_leaves_potters_leisure_resort_on_a_roll_1_1858785 As Potters' link with bowls grew, so did their investment in the sport and subsequently their relationship with the World Bowls Tour.http://www.worldbowlstour.tv In 1999 the resort hosted the World Indoor Bowls Championships for the first time,http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/norfolk/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8441000/8441515.stm having moved from its long standing home in Preston.

It belongs to Hajn√≥wka deanery in the Warszawa-Bielsko diocese of the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church. The temple is located on Szkolna street.  History  The church was built in 1872 on a plot gifted by Klima≈Ñski, a local landowner. It replaced the old 18th century wooden church, which was dismantled and moved to Rogacz. Construction began on 15 August 1867 and was completed on 23 November 1872, when the church was blessed. The oak iconostasis was funded by the parish priest ‚Äì Parteniusz Bazylewski. In 1900, a stone fence was erected around the building. After World War II, icons at the church were adorned by richly decorated frames, made by Micha≈Ç Ochrymiuk, a local artist. On 9 December 2011 the church was entered into the Polish Registry of Cultural Heritage under A-369.  Celebrations of the Dormition of the Mother of God holiday in Dubiny  Due to the church's dedication, the Dormition of the Mother of God is an especially important date and has been enhanced with local traditions, such as the blessing of harvest and herbs.  Fast  Video recording of the Dormition celebrations in Dubiny, 2015 Two weeks of fasting precede the event. During that time, the faithful should not eat meat, dairy products or eggs, but are allowed to eat fish. Different sources present various examples of the fast. According to some, fish can be eaten on any day except Wednesday and Friday, since these days commemorate, respectively, Judas' betrayal and the Crucifixion. Other sources claim that Mondays should be also observed as fasting days, as that day of the week is dedicated to the Angels.  Evening prayers and displaying the Epitaphios  On 27 August, evening prayers are held in the church and on the next day the Akathist of the Dormition of the Mother of God is sung, followed by the Liturgy. During the evening prayers a procession takes place and the Epitaphios (a cloth icon depicting the Mother of God) is displayed. The Dubiny tradition differs from the Jerusalem standard, which has the Epitaphios presented at the beginning of morning prayers. The icon cloth is placed on the grave of the Mother of God, located in the church's centre. Next, priests read out verses about the Mother of God falling asleep and her departure, as well as explain the meaning and significance of the holiday. After that, four women carry the Epitaphios out of the church and a procession symbolising the journey of the dead Mother of God to her grave circles the temple. The procession is led by local men carrying standards and pennants depicting saints. They are followed by the women with the Epitaphios, while the parish priest walks underneath ‚Äì it is a local custom (in Jerusalem, the holy icon is taken off the Epitaphios and carried on by the Patriarch; in Dubiny, the parish priest is unable to carry the heavy cloth on his own, so the Epitaphios is stretched over his head by the women). The priest walking underneath the cloth always carries a bible. The rest of the faithful follow them in a procession. The church's bells ring throughout the whole ceremony. The elderly women carrying the cloth during the celebrations After circling the church three times, the procession returns inside and the next ritual takes place: the faithful walk under the Epitaphios. According to the tradition, walking under a pall (either Mother of God's or Christ's) brings divine grace. Finally, the evening prayers end with the adoration of the Epitaphios, which is placed on the Mother of God's grave and the congregation can walk up to it and kiss Mary's depiction. Afterwards, the parish priest anoints them with blessed oil. In Orthodox tradition the Sacrament of Anointment is a healing rite, it helps to treat body, mind and soul and as such can be administered to anyone in need. In some Orthodox churches the bishop administers the sacrament to anyone who attended the morning prayers and Holy Thursday celebrations.  Morning Prayers  On 28 August, early in the morning, the celebration of the Akathist of the Dormition of the Mother of God and the Liturgy take place. During the Liturgy the priests may also preach about the Dormition. These sermons may also take the form of cautionary advice, which explains the moral issues the holiday touches upon, for example the nature of death and human relation to it. During the morning prayers and the Liturgy, another local Dubiny tradition takes place: two rows of elderly women, holding lit blessed candles, stand before the altar. This custom can be observed during each of the 12 important Orthodox holidays. The candles are handmade by the women and lighting them on a holiday is considered a unique form of prayer.  Blessing of Harvest and Herbs  Blessing of Harvest and Herbs during morning prayers is a local Dubiny tradition. The faithful bring bunches of herbs and flowers that symbolize the year's harvest. The bunches are made from various plants, depending on the season and availability of certain herbs. Typically, they include ears of wheat and rye, flowers, herbs and vegetables. During the blessing priests say a prayer that infuses the herbs with the power of protecting from evil. They are also used for incensing ‚Äì a person thus cleansed may participate in the sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy Communion. Blessed herbs, such as Easter palms, are burnt after a year.

This document is the legitimate successor of the International Charter of Physical Education and Sport, originally adopted in 1978, during the 20th General Conference of UNESCO. The original Charter, which was amended in 1991, was the first rights-based document to state that \\"the practice of physical education and sport is a fundamental right for all\\". Based on the universal spirit of the original Charter (1978), and integrating the significant evolutions in the field of sport over the last 37 years, the revised Sport Charter highlights the health benefits of physical activity, the inclusion of persons with disabilities, the protection of children, the role of sport for development and peace, as well as the need to protect the integrity of sport from doping, violence, manipulation and corruption.  Objectives  In twelve brief articles, the revised Charter serves as a universal reference on the ethical and quality standards of physical education, physical activity and sport. While preserving the initial intention of the 1978 Charter, this new document also represents a renewed commitment of the international sports community to actively promote sport as a catalyst for peace and development. The revised version of the Sport Charter provides a framework that orients the protection of the integrity of sport and supports broader policies in favour of grassroots sport. It also recognizes physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies. UNESCO Director-General, Irina Bokova said: \\"The adoption of the revised Charter should mark a shift away from words towards action, from policy intent to implementation. It sets the tone for a new international sport policy debate, which should now focus on the exchange of good practice, education and training programmes, capacity development, and advocacy. This is also a strong recognition of physical education as a driver for promoting gender equality, social inclusion, non-discrimination and sustained dialogue in our societies\\".  Contents  The International Charter of Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport contains a preamble and 12 articles. These are the main values defended by the Charter:  Access to sport as a fundamental right for all  Article 1 - The practice of physical education, physical activity and sport is a fundamental right for all  The values and benefits of sport  Article 2 - Physical education, physical activity and sport can yield a wide range of benefits to individuals, communities and society at large Article 11 - Physical education, physical activity and sport can play an important role in the realization of development, peace and post-conflict and post-disaster objectives  Quality and ethical principles  Article 4 - Physical education, physical activity and sport programmes must inspire lifelong participation. Article 5 ‚Äì All stakeholders must ensure that their activities are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. Article 6 - Research, evidence and evaluation are indispensable components for the development of physical education, physical activity and sport. Article 7 - Teaching, coaching and administration of physical education, physical activity and sport must be performed by qualified personnel. Article 8 - Adequate and safe spaces, facilities and equipment are essential to quality physical education, physical activity and sport. Article 9 - Safety and the management of risk are necessary conditions of quality provision. Article 10 - Protection and promotion of the integrity and ethical values of physical education, physical activity and sport must be a constant concern for all  The roles of different stakeholders  Article 3 ‚Äì All stakeholders must participate in creating a strategic vision, identifying policy positions and priorities. Article 12 ‚Äì International cooperation is a prerequisite for enhancing the scope and impact of physical education, physical activity and sport.  Applications  The Quality Physical Education Policy Project illustrates how principles and recommendations stipulated in the Charter can be translated into indicators, benchmarks and tools.  Authors of the Revision  The revision of the Charter involved experts and practitioners from governments, sports organizations, academia and NGOs. This new version was carefully examined through sessions of the Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS) and its Permanent Consultative Council (PCC), as well as UNESCO‚Äôs Executive Board. It is a follow-up to the Declaration of Berlin that was adopted by 600 participants from 121 countries, as an outcome of the 5th World Conference of Sport Ministers (MINEPS V).  MINEPS  Created in 1976, the International Conference of Ministers and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport (MINEPS) is a forum that facilitates intellectual and technical exchange in the field of physical education and sport. MINEPS also serves as an institutional mechanism for a coherent international strategy in this domain. It is also the only global platform that engages governments, intergovernmental organizations, the sport movement, academia and specialized NGOs.  CIGEPS  The Intergovernmental Committee for Physical Education and Sport (CIGEPS) was established in 1978 to promote the role and value of sport and its inclusion in public policy. CIGEPS is composed of expert representatives in the field of physical education and sport from 18 UNESCO Member States, each elected for a four-year term. In 2015, CIGEPS is composed of the 18 following member states of UNESCO: Permanent Consultative Council  The Permanent Consultative Council (PCC), comprising key sport federations, UN agencies and NGOs, provides technical support and advice to the CIGEPS.

Guilt and shame, while both being negative social or moral emotions and behavioral regulators, differ in their perceived causes and motivations: feelings of shame are brought on by external sources and affect ego and self-image, whereas guilt is a self- originating emotion and focuses on the impact on others. Measures of shame and guilt are useful for understanding individuals' reactions to embarrassing and regrettable situations in psychotherapy and psychopathology. Some of the most commonly used measures are Harder's Personal Feelings Questionnaire-2 (PFQ-2), introduced in 1990, Self-Conscious Affect and Attribution Inventory (SCAAI), Test of Self-Conscious Affect (TOSCA), and the more recently introduced Guilt and Shame Proneness Scale (GASP).Tracy, J. (2007). Assessing Self-Conscious Emotions: A Review of Self-Report and Nonverbal Measures. In The self- conscious emotions: Theory and research. New York: Guilford Press. Methods Measures of guilt and shame are typically a self-report survey that provides examples of feelings of guilt and shame, or scenarios in which a person might experience one of those feelings. The respondents are usually required to indicate, using a numbered scale, the likelihood they would experience each emotional response. In some cases responses are instead multiple choice. These methods do not require the respondent to formulate or give definitions guilt or shame, and prevent discrepancies that might arise from individual's varied definitions. Differences in the classifications of guilt and shame can and do occur across different measures, however, and can be seen when multiple measures give slightly differing results for the same subject. Measures Guilt and Shame Proneness Scale The GASP is a relatively new measure of guilt and shame developed by Taya R. Cohen that takes a different approach to the classifications of these emotions. The self-report test assesses guilt- proneness and shame-proneness rather than just the presence of the feelings. The test is unique for its subclassifications of guilt and shame into: guilt- negative-behavior-evaluation (NBE), guilt-repair, shame-negative-self- evaluation (NSE), and shame-withdraw. There are 16 items on the questionnaire, four for each sub classification. Each item is a short description of an everyday embarrassing scenario or transgression; the respondent is asked to imagine they are in that situation and then indicate how likely it is that their experience would match the described through a 1‚Äì7 scale, \\"1\\" meaning \\"very unlikely\\" and \\"7\\" meaning \\"very likely\\". The scenarios are varied to include workplace failures, petty crime, social faux pax, among others. Research conducted using the GASP showed that it could reliably measure guilt- proneness and shame-proneness, and that guilt proneness was correlated to healthy prosocial behaviors, while shame was correlated with more unhealthy antisocial behavior. The GASP has an advantage over existing measures of guilt and shame for its ability to test for different types of guilt and shame, especially the ability to distinguish NSE from withdrawal in shame, where there is commonly uncertainty in tests such as the TOSCA. This test is potentially useful in predicting undesirable behavior in individuals by evaluating their dispositions towards the sub types of reactions rather than just their tendency toward either feeling guilt or shame. Personal Feelings Questionnaire-2 An expanded version of D. W. Harder's original PFQ developed in 1987, the PFQ-2 is a self-response questionnaire consisting of adjectives and statements that describe either shame or guilt. The adjectives and statements are ranked on a 5-point scale, a \\"0\\" response meaning the individual never experiences that feeling and a \\"4\\" meaning that they experience it almost constantly. The questionnaire has been used to show correlations between guilt and shame, attachment styles, and the \\"Big Five\\" personality traits: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. The measure was used in conjunction with other self-report measures of personality and attachment in research which concluded that guilt and shame have significant correlations to \\"broad, enduring personality constructs\\". Self-Conscious Affect and Attribution Inventory Presented in 1990 by The SCAAI was developed specifically for young adult populations, offering scenarios that college-age individuals might typically encounter and providing four possible responses to each scenario. The responses correlate to guilt, shame, externalization of blame, and detachment. The measure was one of the first to use scenario-based responses, as opposed to the more commonly used adjective response styles. Through testing, the SCAAI was determined reliable over the four sub scales of shame, guilt, externalization and detachment; the pride sub scales had much lower reliability and are thus not considered one of main uses of the measure. Tests using the SCAAI found the shame and guilt sub scales to be positively intercorrelated, allowing researchers to conclude that the two sub scales are highly related but functionally different. Test of Self-Conscious Affect Originally modeled after the SCAAI, the current version of the TOSCA, the TOSCA-3 is the most commonly used measure of guilt and shame today. The TOSCA-3 measures guilt and shame proneness through a series of 16 scenarios developed from descriptions of real personal experiences of guilt, shame, and pride, including several positive scenarios. The test is of a multiple choice response format, offering four responses to each of the 16 scenarios, where each choice is rated on a 5-point scale, a \\"1\\" rating meaning \\"not likely\\" and a \\"5\\" rating meaning \\"very likely\\". The validity of the TOSCA has been supported through research on guilt and shame proneness as a risk factor for psychological maladjustment. However, the TOSCA has been criticized for being overly simplistic in judging guilt as a healthier, more prosocial response than shame, for problems distinguishing guilt and shame, and for attempting to measure personality dispositions through a test of specific scenarios. Though typically used to measure the trait emotions of guilt and shame, the TOSCA has been found to be a good predictor of tendency towards guilt-related and motivated behaviors or shame-related emotions; the test was not able to distinguish the tendency to feel either emotion, which is important in determining risks for related psychological issues such as depression, low self-esteem, etc. Uses Guilt and shame are key motivators to moral action and highly affect how a person responds to emotional stimuli. And individual's proneness to feel guilt or shame and their proneness to act according to one of them have implications for emotional stability and interpersonal tendencies. Motivations for moral actions can be give insight into how an individual perceives themselves and negative situations, which may be valuable information in psychotherapy, workplaces, schools, and many other environments yet to be explored in this context. The TOSCA has shown links between shame- proneness and depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Silfver, M., Helkama, K., L√∂nnqvist, J., & Verkasalo, M. (2008). The relation between value priorities and proneness to guilt, shame, and empathy. Motivation and Emotion Motiv Emot, 69-80. As such, researchers using the TOSCA have concluded that \\"it may be useful for clinicians to pay attention to a client's propensity to feel shame and their tendency to externalize blame as indicators of risk for psychological maladjustment\\". The TOSCA and SCAAI have both been used in studies concerning the relationship between feelings of guilt/shame and anger/aggression, which found that shame is positively related to anger, suspiciousness, and hostility while guilt was negatively related to anger. This finding supports that guilt is the more pro-social emotional response and also opens new areas of interest in studies of anger and violence. Shame scales in studies using the TOSCA and PFQ-2 have shown correlation to a multitude of aspects of psychopathology, but have also shown enough overlap with the guilt scales that there is potential for more research in this area. In addition, recent research by Mintz, Etengoff & Grysman in the Journal of Child and Family Studies linked retrospective reports of parenting behaviors to emerging adults' reports of shame and guilt as measured by the TOSCA.Mintz, G., Etengoff, C., & Grysman, A.

Although the Revolution began in 1789 as a peaceful, bourgeois-led effort for increased political equality for the Third Estate (the non-elite, unprivileged masses of France), it soon turned into a violent, popular rebellion. To escape political tensions and save their lives, a number of individuals emigrated from France and settled in the neighboring countries (chiefly Great Britain, Austria, and Prussia or other German states), however quite a few also went to the United States.  Revolution begins  When the Estates General convened in 1789 and aired out their political grievances, many members of each estate found themselves in agreement with the idea that the bulk of France, the Third Estate, was carrying the tax burden without equitable political representation. They even took an oath, the Tennis Court Oath, swearing to pursue their political goals and committing to drafting a constitution which codified equality. Soon, the ideologies of fair and equal treatment by the government and liberation from the old regime diffused throughout France.  The first √©migr√©s  While the \\"Father of the Revolution\\", Abb√© Si√®yes, and several other men of the first and second estates supported the Third Estate's desire for equality, several members of the clergy and nobility were averse to it. Under the old regime, they were accustomed with a certain quality of living and with the right to pass this life to their children. The Revolution was looking to remove all privilege in an effort to make everyone politically equal, so the first √©migr√©s, or emigrants, were proponents of the old order and chose to leave France although emigration abroad was not prohibited. The summer of 1789 saw the first voluntary √©migr√©s. Many of these √©migr√©s were members of the nobility who migrated out of fear sparked by the Storming of the Bastille in July 1789.Childs, Frances Sergeant. French Refugee Life in the United States: 1790-1800, an American Chapter of the French Revolution. Philadelphia: Porcupine, 1978. Print. Notable √©migr√©s include Madames Ad√©la√Øde and Victoire, aunts of King Louis XVI, who on 19 February 1791 started their journey to Rome to live nearer to the Pope. However, their journey was stopped by and largely debated by the National Assembly who feared that their emigration implied that King Louis and his family would soon follow suit. While this fear eventually resulted in the Day of Daggers and later the King's attempt to escape Paris, the Madames were permitted to continue their journey after statesman Jacques- Fran√ßois de Menou joking about the Assembly's preoccupation with the actions of \\"two old women\\". Upon settling in neighboring countries such as Great Britain, they were able to assimilate well and maintained a certain level of comfort in their new lifestyles. This was a significant emigration; it marked the presence of many royalists outside France where they could be safe, alive, and await their opportunity to reenter the French political climate. But events in France made the prospect of return to their former way of life uncertain. In November 1791, France passed a law demanding that all noble √©migr√©s return by January 1, 1792. If they chose to disobey, their lands were confiscated and sold, and any later attempt to reenter the country would result in execution. Popkin, Jeremy D. A Short History of the French Revolution. London: Routledge, 2016. Print. However, the majority of the √©migr√©s left France not in 1789 at the crux of the revolution, but in 1792 after the warfare had broken out. Unlike the privileged classes who had voluntarily fled earlier, those displaced by war were driven out by fear for their lives and were of lower status and lesser or no means.  Motivation to leave  As the notions of political freedom and equality spread, people began developing different opinions on who should reap the benefits of active citizenship. The political unity of the revolutionaries had begun to fizzle out by 1791, although they had succeeded in establishing a Constitutional monarchy. Simultaneously, the Revolution was plagued with many problems. In addition to political divisions, they were dealing with the hyperinflation of the National Convention's fiat paper currency, the assignats, revolts against authority in the countryside, slave uprisings in colonial territories such as the Haitian Revolution, and no peaceful end in sight. Someone had to be blamed for the failures of the revolution, and it certainly could not be the fault of the revolutionaries for they were on the side of liberty and justice. As Thomas E. Kaiser argues in his article \\"From the Austrian Committee to the Foreign Plot: Marie-Antoinette, Austrophobia, and the Terror\\", centuries of Austrophobia was reincarnated into a firm belief in an Austrian led conspiracy aiming to thwart the revolution. Kaiser states that the Foreign Plot: > consisted of a massive, multilayered conspiracy by counterrevolutionary > agents abetted by the allies, who allegedly‚Äîand quite possibly in > reality‚Äîsought to undermine the Republic through a coordinated effort to > corrupt government officials associated with the more moderate wing of the > Jacobin establishment and to defame the government by mobilizing elements on > the extreme left.\\" A political faction known as the Jacobins, who had a very active radical faction, the Girondists, genuinely feared this conspiratorial plot. Rousseau, a philosophe influential in the Enlightenment, spread the idea of a \\"collective will\\", a singular purpose which the people of a nation must all unequivocally support. If anyone was against the collective will, they were a part of this counterrevolutionary conspiracy, and since the momentum of the Revolution had to be protected at all costs, any and all threats had to be eliminated. This attitude toward dissension only grew more violent and bloodthirsty throughout 1793-1794 when Robespierre enacted the Reign of Terror. In order to preserve the \\"republic of virtue\\", Robespierre had to \\"cleanse\\" the country of anyone who spoke out or acted against the virtues of the revolution by way of the guillotine.  Exodus  During the Terror, no one was safe from scrutiny or potential execution, ultimately not even Robespierre himself. This omnipresent sense of fear inspired many of lesser means to flee France, often without much preparation and therefore no money or helpful belongings. Those who left France were a heterogeneous bunch socioeconomically and professionally, although the vast majority of migrants were men. While these people came from diverse financial backgrounds, they all more or less suffered the same poverty while traveling. In his thesis \\"'La G√©n√©reuse Nation!' Britain and the French Emigration 1792-1802\\", Callum Whittaker recounts that while leaving France one aristocrat \\"disguised herself as a sailor, and hid for a day in the hold of a ship underneath a pile of ropes\\". Also, captains and sailors saw this as an opportunity to earn a little on the side, and so they levied taxes on the emigrants, leaving them on the shores of another nation with nothing. Yet still, thousands chose this path of discomfort and destitution because it at least provided the promise of peace. This exodus largely took place during 1791-1794. Groups of √©migr√©s that fled during this period included non-juring priests (i.e. priests that refused to take the oath of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy). They fled following the confiscation of their estates as well as legislation in August 1792 that stipulated that these refractory priests leave France willingly or be deported to French Guiana. The demise of Robespierre in 1794 provided a brief respite for Royalists at home and abroad. For example, those who had participated in the Vend√©e uprising were able to communicate with their supporters in Great Britain. These rebels, in collaboration with their British allies, attempted to take a port on the French coast. However, this attempt was unsuccessful, resulting in the execution of 748 royalist officers, an event that became known as the Quiberon disaster. As the Republic evolved into the Directory, fears that √©migr√©s with royalist leanings would return prompted harsher legislation against them, including the Law of Hostages passed in 1799. This legislation considered relatives of √©migr√©s as hostages and ordered them to surrender within ten days or to be treated as √©migr√©s themselves.  Jewish migration  The Jewish people were viewed with suspicion during this time. While a percentage of the Jewish people was politically aligned with the Royalists, the distrust was unwarranted. A majority of Jews were not counterrevolutionaries and did not partake in crimes against the republic such as money crimes with the assignats, although this was highly speculated. In Alsace, minorities such as the Jews and Protestants were pro-revolution, while the Catholic majority was not. Despite these facts, as Zosa Szajkowski states in the text Jews and the French Revolutions of 1789, 1830, and 1848 it was still a widely held belief that \\"the Jews wanted to bring about a counter- revolution with all its destruction and death\\". Thus, the Jews were continuously unfairly suspected of fraud, although rarely ever convicted for it. Also, their correspondence in Hebrew with those living outside France was restricted. August Mauger, the leader of the terror in Nancy, refused to give Jews passports. Those emigrating had to do so illegally, without proper documentation and thus without guarantee of success. Threat of execution was very real for many more people than simply the Jewish population of France. Lacoste, the safety commissioner of Alsace, believed that one-fourth of the Parisian population should be guillotined. Jewish and non-Jewish alike emigrated to the Upper Rhine; despite periodic pogroms in the area, it was still better than the Lower Rhine where the Terror was rampant; very few Jewish Frenchmen remained in Alsace. The Jewish √©migr√©s had to face the challenges of assimilating to a new culture which harbored a strong anti- Jewish and anti-French sentiment. Furthermore, the annual summertime invasions of the French army from 1793-1799 meant the immediate evacuation of any immigrant population. Consequently, the exact number of French in any specific area varied at any given time, but historical estimates place the number in the several thousands.  Emigrant armies  The Arm√©e des √âmigr√©s (Army of the Emigrants) were counter-revolutionary armies raised outside France by and out of royalist √âmigr√©s, with the aim of overthrowing the French Revolution, reconquering France and restoring the monarchy. These were aided by royalist armies within France itself, such as the Catholic and Royal Army and the Chouans, and by allied countries such as Great Britain, Prussia, Austria and the Dutch Republic. They fought, for example, at the sieges of Lyon and Toulon.  Life after emigration  For most √©migr√©s, returning to France was out of the question. While they did manage to escape the guillotine, they would face the death penalty if they were to return. Furthermore, their property and possessions were confiscated by the state, so there would be nowhere and nothing to return to. Wherever the migrants ended up, it was imperative that they were able to assimilate to the local culture. Upon arrival in their host nations, the √©migr√©s were watched with a cautious eye. Many locals were naturally weary of these foreigners who did not share their customs and who had been exposed to radical, violent, revolutionary principles. Although there was initial hesitation, citizens quickly learned that these migrants were refugees, searching for tranquility and focusing on how to feed themselves and their family members, not agents sent by France to disrupt the political order. While this generation of individuals did not have the luxury of being very politically active, their presence in neighboring European countries and the United States caused a wrinkle in the fabric of society. These thousands of men, women, and children had survived a popular uprising and would never be able to forget their experiences in revolutionary France, the uncertainty, turmoil, and promise of liberty.  America  Tens of thousands of √©migr√©s saw America as a compelling destination for multiple reasons. Those who craved peace and stability were drawn to the neutral stance America had taken on the many wars France was engaged in with her neighbors. The majority of emigrants were older and left France as individuals and sought out where to live in the United States based on what professional opportunities were available there. Leaving their homelands with nothing, these Frenchmen were set on finding a way to feed themselves and make a living. Although they appreciated being away from the Terror, the French felt distant from their American denizens and imposed a self-isolation from their community. Along with the social changes that plagued the French nobility in their new transition to America, the √©migr√©s now had to concern themselves with the issue of finances, as a result of the seizing of their assets during the Revolution. They now had to find a way to sustain themselves in a society that did not value them as they had been valued before. Many noblemen found themselves conflicted with the idea of entering the business realm of the American society, as Enlightenment ideals discouraged business as a moral or noble activity. Nonetheless, the √©migr√©s took up pursuits in Real Estate, finance, and smaller family owned businesses. These were all to be temporary endeavors, however, as the French nobility still aimed to leave the Americas at the most opportune moment. Many of the French √©migr√©s returned to France during the Thermidorian regime, which saw more lenient regulations and allowed their names to be erased from the registry of √©migr√©s. Those in America had prepared themselves for the return to French culture by researching the social and political climate, as well as their prospects for earning back their wealth upon arrival. Although some √©migr√©s were willing to leave as soon as they were legally able to, many awaited the changing of the political climate to align to their own ideals before venturing back to France. Many felt the need to be cautious following the radical ideas and events that had characterized the Revolution thus far.  Great Britain  Many more stayed in Europe, in Great Britain, France's neighbour to the north. The country appealed to people because it had a channel separating them from the revolutionaries and because it was known for being tolerant. Additionally, England, more than America, allowed for the maintenance of the French way of life for the elites because \\"the etiquette of European elites was as universal in the eighteenth century as it would ever become\\". Emigrants primarily settled in London and Soho, the latter had grown into a thriving French cultural district, complete with French hotels and cuisine, although it had long been a haven for French exiles, housing many thousands of Frenchmen from the last mass migration which occurred in reaction to the Edict of Nantes. Here the French had a somewhat easier transition into English society, but to say emigrating to this district was easy is to dismiss how truly austere their circumstance; \\"money remained a chronic concern and hunger a constant companion\\" (Whittaker). Most people just picked back up the trades they had in France, and aristocrats found themselves having to seek employment for the first time in years. Those who were educated often offered their services as instructors in French, dancing, and fencing. Those who had no knowledge of skills that would benefit them as laborers turned to crime. The truly elite √©migr√©s settled in Marylebone, Richmond, and Hampstead. The politics of these areas were extremely royalist. In contrast, √©migr√©s from the lower classes of society often settled in St. Pancras and St. George's Fields. Both of these areas facilitated the ability of the √©migr√©s to maintain their Catholic faith. In St. Pancras, √©migr√©s were allowed to use the Anglican church, and for occasions of particular significance, they were allowed to worship without any interference from the Anglican clergy. In St. George's Fields, the Chapel of Notre-Dame was opened in 1796. These poorer √©migr√©s were an eclectic group. They included widows, men wounded in war, the elderly, the ecclesiastics, and some provincial nobility along with domestic servants. It has been noted that \\"there was little that these √©migr√©s had in common besides their misfortunes and their stoic perseverance in the absence of any alternative\\" Malnutrition and poor living conditions led to an onslaught of maladies, and death did not quite put an end to their suffering for even posthumously their families were beset with the financial burden of administering their funeral rites. The number of refugees fleeing into Britain reached its climax in autumn of 1792. In September alone, a total of nearly 4000 refugees landed in Britain. The number of displaced persons who found themselves in Great Britain was high, although the exact number is debated, it is believed to be in the thousands. The uncontrolled influx of foreigners created significant anxiety in government circles and the wider community. After much debate, the Parliament of Great Britain passed the Aliens Act of 1793 which served to regulate and reduce immigration. Those entering the country were required to give their names, ranks, occupations, and addresses to the local Justice of Peace. Those who did not comply, were deported or imprisoned. Community concern at the influx of French refugees slowly abated as time passed and the circumstances of the French Revolution became better known, and there is considerable evidence of charitable and hospitable acts toward the √©migr√©s. The Wilmot Committee, a private network of social elite, provided fiscal support to the refugees, and later the government adopted a national relief campaign which gained support both from those with political clout as well as the masses.

Life Laura Leah Margolis was born October 19, 1903 in Constantinople (now Istanbul). Her father, Herman Margolis, was a halutz and agronomist and her mother Cecilia was the daughter of Dr. Solomon Schwartz, the personal physician to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Herman Margolis moved to Dayton, Ohio in 1907 and Cecilia, Margolis and her younger brother, Otto, joined him in 1908, eventually settling in Cleveland, Ohio. Margolis received her Bachelor of Science from Ohio State University in 1926 and a professional degree in social work from the School of Applied Social Sciences at Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1927. In the 1930s, Margolis worked for various Jewish social service organizations, including the Jewish Social Services in Cleveland, Jewish Social Service Association in New York City and the Jewish Welfare Society in Buffalo, NY. Wartime career with the Joint Distribution Committee In January 1939, Margolis became the first female field agent of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee when Cecilia Razovsky of the National Refugee Service, an agency associated with the JDC, hired her to go to Cuba. In Cuba, she worked closely with American consular officials to help the approximately 5,000 refugees who had arrived from Europe, mostly Germany and Austria. When the MS St. Louis with its 900 passengers was approaching Havana harbor in May 1939, Margolis tried to find a port of entry in either Cuba, the United States or Canada, but the ship was forced to return to Europe. In light of Margolis‚Äô overall success in Cuba, officials from the United States State Department requested that the JDC send her to Shanghai in May 1941 in order to assist United States' consular officials. Of the approximately 20,000 Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria then in Shanghai, around 8,000 refugees received at least one meal each day from JDC soup kitchens. In the months before the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, Margolis modernized the soup kitchens, making them more efficient and better able to serve the refugee community. Margolis was interned as an enemy alien by the Japanese from February 1943 through September 1943, when she was released as part of a prisoner exchange. Even during her internment, she ensured that the soup kitchens remained open. Margolis returned to the United States in December 1943, where she found out for the first time about the extent of the extermination of the Jews in Europe and the existence of the concentration camps. She insisted that she be sent to Europe, although JDC officials were hesitant to send a woman into an active war zone. She arrived in Lisbon in March 1944 and then traveled to Spain, where she was active in arranging a home for children smuggled over the Pyrenees Mountains from France. She then traveled to Sweden, where she organized sending relief supplies from Stockholm to Theresienstadt and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. She traveled to liberated Belgium in January 1945, where she was the JDC representative in Belgium and where she first encountered concentration camp survivors returning from Germany and Eastern Europe. She worked with survivors, children's homes, homes for the aged, and aided Palestine Jewish Brigade members helping survivors travel through Belgium to Palestine. She also traveled to the Netherlands to aid the Dutch Jewish community, entering Amsterdam twenty-four hours after the Germans had left. She was decorated by the Belgian government for her work. Post-war career Margolis was sent to France in 1946 as the JDC's first female Country Director, where she helped rebuild the French Jewish community, including setting up children‚Äôs homes, establishing vocational training programs, providing aid for the sick and elderly, and aided people working on illegal immigration to Palestine. In 1950, Margolis married Zionist leader Marc Jarblum (1887‚Äì1972). Jarblum was the editor of two Poale Zion Yiddish newspapers in Paris and was also active in the Resistance during World War II. The Jarblums immigrated to Israel in 1953 where Margolis served as the Director of Social Services for Malben, an organization set up in 1949 by the JDC as a system of services and organizations to care for elderly, chronically ill and handicapped immigrants to Israel. At the end of 1955 she was drafted by the Jewish Agency to work with new immigrants in the new development towns, where she remained until 1958, when she returned to Malben as Director for Special Projects, working with handicapped children and adults. Marc Jarblum died in 1972. Laura Margolis remained at Malben until 1974, when she retired, after which she returned to the United States. Laura Margolis Jarblum died on September 9, 1997 at the home of her nephew, James A. Margolis, in Brookline, Massachusetts at the age of 93.

He was a quarterback for the University of Michigan Wolverines football team from 1985 to 1989 and a starting quarterback for the 1987 and 1988 teams. Brown was the first Michigan quarterback to lead the Wolverines to bowl victories in consecutive seasons, with victories over Alabama in the 1988 Hall of Fame Bowl and USC in the 1989 Rose Bowl. During the 1987 season, Brown also set Michigan school records with seven interceptions in a game and 16 interceptions in a season. Early years Brown grew up in the Overton section of Miami, Florida. His parents were divorced when he was young, and he was raised by his mother. He attended Miami Beach Senior High School. Prior to Brown's freshman year, the school's starting quarterback was killed. He became a four-year starter at quarterback for Miami Beach High. University of Michigan Brown enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1985. Brown did not see any game action in 1985 or 1986 when Jim Harbaugh was Michigan's starting quarterback. 1987 season Following a preseason battle with Chris Zurbrugg and Michael Taylor to take over as Michigan's starting quarterback after Harbaugh's graduation, Brown became Michigan's starting quarterback in 1987. In his fifth start, a 17‚Äì11 loss to Michigan State, Brown drew the ire of Michigan fans when he threw a school record seven interceptions. One week after the Michigan State game, Brown threw a career best three touchdown passes, all in the first half, with no interceptions, and compiled 190 passing yards, against an Iowa team with the No. 1 pass defense team in the country. He also ran for a touchdown to lead Michigan to a 37‚Äì10 victory over Iowa. Brown played through the 1987 season with a broken thumb on his left hand (his throwing hand), sustained on October 24 against Indiana, and a badly dislocated thumb on his right hand, sustained two weeks later against Minnesota. In November 1987, Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler said of Brown: > \\"I don't know if you like him or not, but that is one tough kid. And I don't > know if he likes me all the time, because I yell at him. But I like him.\\" Brown and running back Jamie Morris led Michigan to a 28‚Äì24 victory over Alabama in the 1988 Hall of Fame Bowl. Morris ran for three touchdown, and Brown then threw a game-winning, 20-yard touchdown pass to John Kolesar with less than a minute remaining in the game. The 1987 Michigan team led by Brown compiled an 8‚Äì4 record and outscored opponents 331 to 172. Brown had 1,355 yards of total offense during the 1987 season, 1,251 passing yards and 104 net rushing yards.(type \\"brown\\" in the box for Last Name and \\"demetrius\\" in the box for First Name to pull Brown's statistics) He was also intercepted a school record 16 times in 1987. 1988 season At the beginning of the 1988 season, Brown faced eligibility issues due to academic deficiencies. Michael Taylor won the starting quarterback spot, but Brown resumed the starting role after Taylor sustained a broken collarbone. After setting a school record with 16 interceptions in 1987, Brown turned matters around in 1988, allowing zero interceptions in 84 passing attempts. For the season, Brown completed 48 of 84 passes for 775 yards and six touchdowns. Brown led the 1988 team to a Big Ten Conference championship with five consecutive wins at the end of the regular season. In the 1988 Michigan‚ÄìOhio State game, Brown completed 11 of 17 passes for a career-high 223 passing yards. He also threw touchdown passes of 57 yard to Greg McMurtry and 41 yards to John Kolesar. Brown's performance helped Michigan defeat Ohio State, 34‚Äì31, to win the Big Ten football championship and a berth in the Rose Bowl. Brown's final game for Michigan was the 1989 Rose Bowl. Prior to the game, USC defensive back Tracy Butts predicted that the Trojans would intercept four passes off Brown. Instead, Brown completed 11 of 24 passes for 144 yards, including a touchdown pass to Chris Calloway and no interceptions, as Michigan defeated USC, 22‚Äì14. After the game, Brown told reporters: \\"I'd like to talk to Tracy Butts.\\" Career statistics During his career at Michigan, Brown completed 128 of 252 passes for 2,026 yards, 17 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He also gained 122 net rushing yards and scored five rushing touchdowns on 89 carries.

Considered one among the oldest families in Rome, it was deeply rooted in the Roman nobility because of the gallantry of many members. The family died out in the 17th century, and its name came to an end in 1813. The Capizucchis had their homes in Campitelli rione, at the foot of Capitoline Hill, and there also lay their palace. This still exists and is located between two squares, Piazza Campitelli and the one that took its name from the family, Piazza Capizucchi. History Traditionally considered to be kindred to the counts of Thun, the family is considered to be among the oldest in Rome. However, the alleged existence of two Cardinals belonging to the family, named Roberto and Giovanni Roberto Capizucchi, who bore respectively the cardinal title of San Clemente al Monte Celio (in late eleventh century) and Santa Sabina (in early twelfth century), has to be considered a falsehood originated in 16th century. A certain Jacobello Capizucchi, lord of Turris Candulphorum near the current Cecchina, was Conservatore (city counselor) of Rome in 1375. In 1341, from the family was chosen one of the twelve pages representing the Roman gentlemen who participated in the parade for the coronation of Francesco Petrarca on the Capitoline Hill. In 1390, as a bequest of a Coluccio de' Capizucchi, was given in giuspatronato to the family the chapel of San Paolo in the church of Santa Maria de Campitello, with the mortmain of the casale of San Ciriaco along the Via Ostiense. Related to the main families of the Roman nobility at the beginning of the sixteenth century with Bruto and Marcello, the family reached the height of its fame as part of the Capitoline nobility thanks to the gallantry and the profession of arms, both deeply rooted among its members as Papirio, Cencio and Camillo. With Marcello's son Biagio, who ‚Äì among others ‚Äì participated to the battle of Lepanto on the orders of Marcantonio Colonna and could gain more than 100,000 scudi from his occupation as man-at-arms, the family reached the apogee of its wealth, buying the estates of Catino and Poggio Catino and building the palace which became its residence. This was perhaps designed before 1593 by Giacomo Della Porta, and had its main facade along Piazza Campitelli. In front of the palace lay the church of Santa Maria in Campitelli, where many of the Capizucchis are buried in the family's chapel, whose existence is attested since 1390. Fa√ßade of Palazzo Capizucchi along Piazza Campitelli in Rome To the family belonged also the Cardinals Gianantonio and Raimondo who both, respectively, in the 16th and 17th centuries, served in the administration of the Holy See, reaching high positions. The family, however, declined financially because of the passion for gambling of some of its members, who were forced to sell some of their fiefs. Moreover, it would have become extinct already in the seventeenth century, had not Francesco, the last exponent of the family, adopted his cousin Alessandro Marescotti. The latter accepted to use the surname Capizucchi \\"unmixed\\" and got the whole patrimony of the family, amounting to 150,000 scudi. The family became extinct definitively in 1813, with the death of Alessandro Capizucchi. The Capizucchi were one of the sixty famiglie coscritte, which constituted the Roman patriciate, as defined in the Papal Bull Urbem Romam, issued in 1746 by pope Benedict XIV (r. 1740‚Äì58). At the apogee of their power, they owned the fiefs of Catino, Poggio Catino, Montieri and Fabro with title of marquess and were owners of various estates in the Roman Campagna, as the Cecchignola and Palidoro.

The Kuomintang in Burma (KMT) were Chinese Nationalist troops that fled to the Burmese border region in 1950 after their defeat to the Communists in the Chinese Civil War. Technically termed the Yunnan Anti-communist National Salvation Army (sometimes also referred to as the \\"Lost Army\\"), the KMT was commanded by General Li Mi. It made several unsuccessful invasions into Yunnan Province in the early 1950s, only to be pushed back into Burma each time by forces of the Chinese Communist Party's People's Liberation Army. The entire campaign, with logistical support from the United States, the Republic of China (withdrawn to Taiwan), and Thailand, was controversial from the start. It not only violated Burmese sovereignty and destabilized the political situation in the fledgling Burmese nation but also saw the Kuomintang's (KMT) involvement in the region's lucrative opium trade. In 1953, the frustrated Burmese government appealed to the United Nations and put international pressure on the Republic of China (which had retreated to Taiwan) to withdraw its troops to Taiwan the following year. It was not until coordinated Sino-Burmese military operations in 1960‚Äì1961 that forced the complete evacuation of the KMT troops and drove the remaining troops out of Burma into neighboring Laos and Thailand. Background Civil war broke out in Burma soon after it gained independence in 1948. The causes of the conflict were largely a legacy of British colonial rule and can be best summed up by what Martin Smith calls the \\"dilemmas of unity in a land of diversity.\\" First, up until 1937, British Burma was not administered as a separate colony but a province of British India. While the British administered the Burman majority in central \\"Ministerial Burma\\", the ethnic minorities in the \\"Frontier Areas\\" remained under the nominal rule of their traditional rulers. The contradictions that existed in the fact that the Burman majority and the historically antagonistic ethnic minorities came to be bound within a single administrative entity were not resolved before the British left. Second, the 1947 Burma Constitution failed to provide for the interests of the diverse minority groups that wanted to retain their autonomy and equal rights within the Union. The federal arrangement between the central government and the peripheral states retained its colonial legacy: Shan and Karenni sawbwas were granted a status similar to that of the rulers of the princely Indian states, with autonomy over administration and law enforcement. On top of that, the Shan and Karenni States also had the extraordinary right of secession after ten years in the Union. In contrast, the Kachin, Chin and Karen remained under central administration, while the Mon and Arakanese did not even have any separate political representation. The contradictions and ambiguities of the Constitution therefore satisfied no one and were the cause for much ethnic dissension.For the divisive ethno-histories of the diverse peoples of Burma, see . Third, the ethnic Burman majority in the central plains was also split by political ideology. Like the Communist parties in Vietnam and Malaya, the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) acquired a high degree of organizational strength and popularity from its anti-Japanese efforts. Furthermore, the People's Volunteer Organization (PVO), the former private army of the nationalist leader Aung San, split between socialist and communist sympathizers, and the latter went underground to join the Communists. This was followed by a series of mutinies in the Union Military Police and the Burmese army. With the inner circle of competent leaders murdered, and army units mutinied along ethnic and ideological lines, the civil war started within a year of independence as the ethnic insurgents (the Karen, Mon and Karenni) as well as the Communists resorted to arms against the government. Gradually, the Burmese Army strengthened and managed to eliminate almost all pockets of resistance. By 1950, many insurgents surrendered to the government during periods of amnesty. The success of the Burmese Army was due largely to its advantage over the rebels in arms and discipline. While the insurgents had superiority in numbers, they were unable to coordinate their activities because of their divergent goals and ideologies. Just when the Burmese government thought it had achieved some measure of political stability and could focus on the urgent task of nation building, the KMT threat arrived on its northeastern borders. The KMT offensive When the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered Yunnan Province in December 1949, the KMT troops and their dependents began crossing into Burma in late December 1949 and early January 1950. Those KMT troops were members of the Eighth Army commanded by General Li Mi, the 26th Army under General Liu Kuo Chwan and the 93rd Division under Major-General Mah Chaw Yu. They settled in Kengtung‚Äîone of the Shan states near the Thai-Burma border‚Äîat the village of Tachilek. [see Young; Taylor; McCoy] General Li Mi took command of the KMT army in Burma and it grew steadily over the next few years as more stragglers made their way across the border and the army recruited from the local population. By March 1950, there were around 1,500 KMT troops occupying territory between Kengtung City and Tachilek. By April 1951 that number grew to more than 4,000 and by year-end it rose to 6,000. It would then double in 1952. In June 1950, the Burmese government demanded that the KMT either surrender or leave Burma immediately. The KMT field commander who received the Burmese request not only refused to comply but declared that the KMT troops had no intention of either surrendering or leaving the area, and would retaliate with force if the Burmese Army initiated military action. In response, the Burmese Army launched a drive from Kengtung City and captured Tachilek within weeks. Forced out of Tachilek, the KMT established a new base camp at Mong Hsat in July 1950. Mong Hsat was the second largest town in the state of Kengtung and was ideally situated for the KMT. It was centrally located in a fertile basin endowed with approximately sixty square miles of rice cultivation area, and it was surrounded by hilly terrain on all sides that acted as natural defense barriers. The town was only eighty miles from the Thailand border and hence supplies could be easily obtained from outside Burma through Thailand. The Burmese Army made several attempts over the next two years but were unsuccessful in ousting the KMT from Mong Hsat. The main reason for KMT's intransigence was its intention to use Burma as a refuge to reorganize, train, and equip themselves for the purpose of launching an invasion to retake Mainland China. Under the command of General Li Mi, an offensive was launched into Yunnan Province in May 1951 involving around 20,000 men. KMT troops moved northward and captured Kengma and its airfield some sixty miles inside China without resistance. However, as they advanced further north, the 40,000-strong People's Liberation Army counterattacked. Li Mi's army suffered huge losses and retreated back to Burma, after less than a month in China. The KMT made two more abortive attempts in July 1951 and August 1952 that took heavy casualties, after which they never invaded Yunnan again and instead \\"settled along the border to gather intelligence and monitor signs of a possible Communist Chinese advance into Southeast Asia.\\" CIA connection and opium trade The KMT army in Burma could not have expanded as it did without the logistical support from the United States, Thailand and Taiwan, as well as the financial support derived from the KMT's involvement in the region's opium trade. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was the primary agency in charge of the covert program called \\"Operation Paper\\" that transported weapons and supplies to the KMT from Taiwan via Thailand. With President Truman's approval and support from Thailand's Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram (also known as \\"Phibun\\"), the CIA put together a secret air supply network that shipped weapons and supplies to General Li Mi's forces in Mong Hsat from Thailand. The first shipments started in early 1951, when unmarked C-46 and C-47 aircraft were making at least five parachute drops a week. By late 1951, the KMT repaired the old airstrip at Mong Hsat constructed by the Allied forces during World War II. The enlarged airstrip could handle large four-engine aircraft and allowed the KMT troops to obtain newly manufactured American weapons from Taiwan. CIA advisers also accompanied the KMT army in the Yunnan invasion in May 1951, and some of them were killed during the offensive. Following their failed attempt to re-enter China in August 1952, the KMT appeared to change its policy of using Burma as a base of operations for the invasion of Communist China to permanent entrenchment in the Shan area. The KMT stopped concentrating their forces near the China border in late 1952 and spread out across the Shan states as well as parts of the Kachin State. Eventually it gained control over the Shan territories between the Salween River on the west, the China border on the east, and Thailand on the south. The KMT army removed all Burmese government officials and became the only effective yet harsh government that ruled over the population of one million. The KMT-controlled territories made up Burma's major opium-producing region, and the shift in KMT policy allowed them to expand their control over the region's opium trade. Furthermore, Communist China's forced eradication of illicit opium cultivation in Yunnan by the early 1950s effectively handed the opium monopoly to the KMT army in the Shan states. Prior to the arrival of the KMT, the opium trade had already developed as a local opium economy under British colonial rule. The main consumers of the drug were the local ethnic Chinese and those across the border in Yunnan and the rest of Southeast Asia. The KMT coerced the local villagers for recruits, food and money, and exacted a heavy tax on the opium farmers. This forced the farmers to increase their production to make ends meet. One American missionary to the Lahu tribesmen of Kengtung State even testifies to the torture the KMT committed to the Lahu for failing to comply with their regulations. The annual production increased twenty-fold from 30 tons at the time of Burmese independence to 600 tons in the mid-1950s.Lintner, Bertil (1992). Heroin and Highland Insurgency in the Golden Triangle. War on Drugs: Studies in the failure of US narcotic policy. Boulder, Colorado: Westview. p. 288. The KMT troops were, in effect, the forebears of the private narcotic armies operating in the \\"Golden Triangle.\\" Almost all the KMT opium was sent south to Thailand. The trade between the KMT and their Thai allies worked such that weapons and military supplies were brought in to Mong Hsat on the incoming trip (either by mule train or aircraft) and KMT opium transported south to Chiang Mai on the outgoing trip. The KMT usually dealt with a powerful Thai police commander and client of the CIA, General Phao Sriyanond, who shipped the opium from Chiang Mai to Bangkok for both local consumption and export. Burmese anxieties The intrusion of KMT troops into Burma posed serious problems of internal and external security for the newly independent country. Internally, the KMT's overtures to the local insurgents exacerbated the existing civil conflict between the Burmese government and the ethnic and Communist insurgents. Starting in late 1951, the KMT made contacts and formed a loose alliance with the Karen National Defense Organization (KNDO), the largest of the still active indigenous insurgent groups. A combination of factors made the KMT-KNDO alliance useful for both groups. Both were aligned in their disagreement with the neutralist foreign policy of Burma and both looked to the West for aid. While the KMT had modern weapons and other military supplies, the KNDO had contacts, local knowledge, and easier access to food supplies. To make matters worse for the government, some of the American-manufactured weapons also made their way (apparently through KNDO) into the hands of the Burmese communist rebels. The net effect of KMT's intrusion into the Burmese civil conflict was that it distracted the Burmese Army from its counter-insurgency efforts and increased the quantity of weapons available to the anti-government rebels. Externally, the existence of anti- communist KMT troops on its borders with China compromised Burma's neutralist foreign policy. As different groups within Burma desired to support one or the other bloc in the Cold War, it was in the government's interests to follow a neutralist policy in order to avoid antagonizing either the pro-Western minorities or the pro-Soviet or pro-Chinese communists. On the other hand, Burma is located between neutralist India to the west, Communist China to the north, and war-torn Laos and pro-United States Thailand to the East. Situated in the middle of these states with differing ideologies and deep antagonisms, this made it necessary for Burma to maintain friendly terms with all of them. The Burmese government feared that the presence of the anti-communist KMT troops on its borders would antagonize Communist China and provide it with an excuse to invade Burma. Indeed, at a time when the Korean War that involved the United States and China was ongoing, such a fear was not unfounded. On its part, Communist China was concerned that the United States might open a second front in its southern provinces by using Burma as a base of operations and the KMT troops as a nucleus for an invasion army. Indeed, China's policies in the early 1950s justified Burma's anxieties. First, Communist China's promulgation and subsequent creation of an autonomous state for the Chinese Shans was an apparent attempt to foster separatist tendencies of the Burmese Shans and attract them to China. Second, since its victory in the Chinese civil war, Communist China had been giving advice and supplies to the Burmese Communists and allowed them to use Chinese territory as a military and political training center. Third, China displayed its belligerence in Yunnan Province by amassing an estimated 200,000 troops, as well as building and repairing roads that led to Burma. Finally, Communist China made claims on territories on the 1,500 mile Sino-Burmese border that both sides had yet to officially demarcate. Fortunately, despite China's militancy, Burma's fears did not materialize as Beijing acted with restraint toward Burma during the entire KMT crisis period. In turn, Rangoon was careful to keep Beijing informed of the KMT issue. International pressure and KMT withdrawal After its military efforts and appeal to the United States failed to resolve the KMT problem, Burma submitted a formal complaint to the United Nations in March 1953, producing reams of photos, captured documents, and testimony convincing enough to win a vote of censure for Taiwan. By then the KMT issue had become \\"such a source of international embarrassment for the United States\\" that it initiated a Four- Nation Military Commission (Burma, the United States, Taiwan, and Thailand) in Bangkok on May 22 to negotiate the KMT withdrawal. After months of negotiations and recalcitrance from the KMT, the three-phase withdrawal finally took place on November 7 and continued into December 1953. The second and third phases were conducted the following year during the periods February 14‚Äì28 and May 1‚Äì7, respectively. The KMT troops and their dependents crossed the Thai-Burmese border and were flown out from Chiang Rai to Taiwan. It was obvious that the KMT carried out its evacuation halfheartedly; Burmese observers at the staging areas frequently protested that the supposedly Chinese evacuees looked more like Shans or Lahus, and the weapons they carried were \\"rusting museum pieces\\" instead of the recently acquired American manufactures. On 30 May 1954, General Li Mi announced the dissolution of the Yunnan Province Anticommunist National Salvation Army. However, 6,000 irregular KMT troops remained in Burma. Fighting began again a month later, and continued sporadically for the next seven years. With the assistance of Communist Chinese troops, the Burmese Army conducted a series of successful military operations in 1960‚Äì1961 that finally \\"broke the back\\" of the KMT irregulars. Furthermore, on 15 February 1961, the Burmese Army managed to down and capture a patrol plane that attempted to drop supplies on the KMT. That incident provided the Burmese government concrete evidence that Taiwan had been supplying the KMT guerillas with military supplies of American origin. The diplomatic crisis that ensued prompted the United States to exert strong pressure on Taiwan to evacuate its remaining troops from Burma. Between March 17 and 31 April 1961, Taiwan evacuated around 4,400 KMT guerillas and dependents. The rest, a handful about 450 to 700, either remained in Burma or fled to Thailand and Laos. Aftermath In general, scholars agree that the KMT crisis was an event of significant impact on Burma's history. The KMT intrusion into Burma had the unintended consequence of precipitating the nationalist sentiments into several ethnic insurrections led by the Shan, Wa and other ethnic groups. Initially the Shans were largely loyal to the newly independent Burmese government throughout the KMT crisis as they were a signatory to the historic Panglong Agreement that granted them secession rights. However, as the Burmese Army was increasingly deployed into Shan State to suppress the KMT presence, the Shans grew increasingly disaffected with Burmese rule. When it came to time for the Shans to deliberate on their status within the Union in 1958, the negative experience of the Army's repressive actions was an additional argument for greater autonomy. As a result, the Burmese Army led by Ne Win, determined to maintain the integrity of the Union, mounted a coup against the government and abrogated both the 1947 Constitution and the rights of the Shan and Karenni states to secede. According to Mary Callahan (2003), the KMT crisis presented a formidable threat to Burma's sovereignty and proved to be a catalyst that forced the Burmese Army's institutionalization, turning it from a band of guerilla fighters into a professional army. Callahan argues that the Burmese Army's transformation gave it enormous autonomy and authority to define who were citizens and enemies in the ethnically diverse state. This transformation laid the foundation for its eventual consolidation of authority in the 1950s that culminated in its takeover of the government. Robert Taylor (1973) makes a similar argument about the significant consequences KMT intervention had on Burma's political, economic and ethnic problems. The KMT army's involvement with the local rebels not only contributed to the Burmese state's failure to deal with the insurgencies, but also stunted Burmese efforts in national integration and economic construction. Other scholars have been critical about the manner in which the United States handled the KMT issue. Kenneth Young's (1970) thesis highlights the Cold War context of the concurrent Korean War as well as the complicated foreign relations between Burma, Thailand, China (both Nationalist and Communist), and the United States. He argues that Operation Paper, the covert CIA program devised to aid the KMT troops in Burma, was a complete failure for the United States. Not only had the United States failed to contain Sino-Burmese relations, it had alienated Burma through its handling of the KMT issue and its failure to restrain the Chinese Nationalists. Furthermore, Alfred McCoy (1991) questions CIA's complicity in KMT's involvement in the opium trade, considering the CIA's role in facilitating the supply network for KMT and the alliance between the KMT and high-ranking Thai officials. After the joint Sino-Burmese military campaign evicted the KMT remnant guerrillas from the Shan states in 1961, the guerrillas retreated across the border to Thailand and dominated the opium trade in the \\"Golden Triangle\\" region until the 1980s. Remnant members of the 93rd Division and their descendants have since formed several communities in Thailand, most notably Santikhiri in Chiang Rai Province. In popular culture The escape of the KMT and their dependents from Yunnan Province to Burma has been given a sympathetic portrayal in A Home Too Far, a 1990 Taiwanese war drama film directed by Kevin Chu starring Andy Lau and Tou Chung-hua. It is based on a novel by Bo Yang, which is based on the true story of the KMT's experience in Burma's border and invasion attempts in Yunnan Province.

It first aired on February 15, 2015, as part of the second episode of the series' second season. During the eighteen-minute segment, comedian John Oliver discusses tobacco industry trends and practices. Toward the end of the segment, Oliver introduces Jeff the Diseased Lung, a mascot he created for the American global cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International, the makers of Marlboro cigarettes. The anthropomorphic diseased lung, who smokes and coughs, has been compared to Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. Oliver and his team promoted the cartoon character by sending shirts with Jeff's image to Togo and displaying billboards in Uruguay, and by encouraging use of the hashtag #JeffWeCan, which trended on Twitter following the broadcast. After the segment, Philip Morris issued a response that received some criticism. The \\"Tobacco\\" segment received widespread media coverage, with several outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and change perceptions about smoking through the creation of the mascot. The Jeff caricature was later used at a May 2015 protest organized by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in New York City. Description \\"Tobacco\\", an eighteen- minute segment about the tobacco industry, was delivered by John Oliver on February 15, 2015, during the second episode of Last Week Tonight second season. Oliver introduces the topic of tobacco smoking by showing video clips of \\"trusted newsmen, cartoon characters, and cowboys in TV commercials\\" who are smoking cigarettes. He says that the cowboy in the clip is Marlboro Man, a figure used in advertising campaigns for Marlboro cigarettes, and notes that four of the actors portraying Marlboro Man have died from lung cancer or smoking-related illnesses. Oliver says that cigarette smoking is no longer as prevalent in the United States because of, among other things, mandatory warnings on all cigarette boxes and a ban on TV advertisements for cigarettes. The comedian says that tobacco executives adamantly refused to acknowledge the potential drawbacks to smoking, despite strong evidence to prove these drawbacks. He shows a video of Joseph Cullman, the former CEO of the tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI), saying that \\"some women would prefer having smaller babies\\" in response to a reporter's comment that pregnant women who smoke will give birth to smaller babies as a result.For a reference for the quote, see: * Even so, the restrictions on smoking advertisements contributed to a decline in smoking rates among American adults, as only 18% of adults smoked in 2014, compared to 43% of adults in 1965. Oliver then shows a clip of a tobacco farmer saying, \\"This is the best time ever to be a tobacco farmer.\\" The comedian says that while American smoking rates have gone down, smoking rates in the rest of the world have gone up. He displays a viral video of a chain smoking baby in Indonesia who reportedly threw tantrums when he did not get to smoke. Oliver then states that the baby's favorite brand of cigarettes is owned by PMI, one of the tobacco companies that has \\"flocked\\" Indonesia and contributed to its smoking epidemic. He cites the World Health Organization's report on the prevalence of tobacco consumption, which stated that 67% of Indonesian males smoked in 2013. and shows an ABC News video of Indonesian schoolboys lighting cigarettes at a kiosk outside their school. He also says that PMI, by its own count, sells \\"seven of the world's top 15 international brands\\" of tobacco, including Marlboro. Afterward, Oliver tells his viewers about tobacco companies' worldwide actions to \\"attack laws intended to protect public health\\". One of these laws was in Australia, where the federal government replaced all branding on tobacco boxes with \\"plain packaging\\" photographs that showed the effects of smoking, including \\"the toe tag on the corpse, the cancerous mouth, the nightmarish eyeball, [and] the diseased lung\\". He references the Department of Health, which states that smoking consumption had declined to historically low levels after the law was passed. Following the passage of this legislation, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco unsuccessfully sued the Australian federal government in the High Court of Australia and, in the process, were forced to pay the government's legal fees. PMI then transferred the ownership of its Australian division to one of its other businesses located in Hong Kong, taking advantage of a treaty that prevented Australia from seizing the property of businesses located in Hong Kong. PMI Hong Kong then sued Australia's government in international court, claiming that Australia was stealing the brands on its boxes by adding the photographs of the effects of smoking. (PMI would lose this lawsuit as well in July 2017.) Oliver says that Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic had also filed complaints with the World Trade Organization over Australia's tobacco-box law. He points out that according to Ukrainian MP Lesya Orobets, Ukraine and Australia did not trade any tobacco products with each other, so Ukraine's complaint was unwarranted. The comedian says that according to Bloomberg.com, these nations' complaints to the WTO have been funded by PMI, British American, and other tobacco companies. Oliver next describes tobacco companies' lawsuits against smaller nations. He says that PMI has sued Uruguay for including obligatory health warnings on tobacco boxes, and that Uruguay's legal fees had become so costly that the billionaire Michael Bloomberg donated $500,000 to help pay these fees. According to the International Tobacco Control Project, the law helped reduce smoking rates between 2006 and 2012, and the rate of smokers who supported federal regulation of smoking had also risen. Additionally, PMI had also sued Togo, which had mandated that each tobacco box sold in the country contain health warnings written in French, a language many of the nations' residents did not read. Oliver compares PMI's US$80 billion revenue in 2013 to Togo's $4.3 billion GDP during the same year. He then reads a cease-and-desist letter from PMI to the Togolese government and says that PMI had cherry-picked a quote from the one dissenting judge in the Australia lawsuit who had ruled in favor of the tobacco industry. The comedian states that British American and its affiliates had sent similar letters to the governments of Namibia and the Solomon Islands. Jeff the Diseased Lung Toward the end of the segment, Oliver offers the mascot Jeff the Diseased Lung for Philip Morris International's use, free of charge. Jeff, whose full name \\"Jeff the Diseased Lung in a Cowboy Hat\\", is a fictional anthropomorphic cartoon character who smokes and coughs. He has been compared to the Marlboro Man and described as Oliver's version of Joe Camel. Jeff has been described as a \\"cartoon-like, diseased lung cowboy created by crossing the diseased lung pictured on cigarette packs in Australia with the Marlboro Man\\". Similarly, Rolling Stone Daniel Kreps said Jeff helps to \\"bridge the gap between the Marlboro Man ... and a 'lung that looks like you're breathing through baked ziti'\\". Alicia Lu of Bustle wrote: > Sure, he may be an anthropomorphic lung that's decaying from being exposed > to years of cigarette smoke, which might not be Big Tobacco's first choice > for branding, but he's a cowboy.

During the segment, Oliver encouraged viewers to use the hashtag \\"#JeffWeCan\\", which later trended on Twitter. He also called on viewers to upload images of the mascot to Google+ accounts so Jeff would be displayed on Google Images searches for \\"Marlboro\\". A live version of Jeff appears at the end of the \\"Tobacco\\" segment. Sarene Leeds of The Wall Street Journal called Jeff's appearance \\"a full-on Disneyland-ish nightmare\\" and wrote: \\"there is nothing more disturbing ‚Äì or awesome ‚Äì that you will see today than the sight of John Oliver dancing around a guy dressed up as a smoking, infected lung surrounded by more than a dozen children\\". After the segment, the HBO Shop started selling T-shirts that depicted the mascot. A performer in a Jeff costume appeared at Kick Butts Day, a protest organized by the Campaign for Tobacco- Free Kids and youth advocates, which was held outside Philip Morris' annual shareholders' meeting in New York City on May 6, 2015. The protests featured a flash mob with fifty dancers performing a choreographed dance to a song with the lyrics, \\"We don't want your cigarettes. Jeff we can!\\" The performance ended with the mascot: \\"rolling around on the floor in a coughing fit and loss of breath\\". Shana Narula, the campaign's coordinator, said: > The whole concept is to use Jeff and the hashtag #JeffWeCan and > #StopMarlboro to show that these marketing tactics are not allowed and > tobacco is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the > world.

Reception John Oliver (pictured in 2016) was praised for his ability to market the mascot Jeff the Diseased Lung. By the morning of February 16, the \\"Tobacco\\" segment had been viewed more than two million times. The segment received widespread media coverage, with several outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and \\"alter perceptions about smoking\\" through the creation of the mascot Jeff. Her Campuss Kelly Tierney noted the enthusiasm displayed by Oliver's fans during the segment and wrote: > While John Oliver simply considers himself a comedian, it is apparent that > he is doing much more than comedy. He informs us of real issues we otherwise > wouldn't hear or think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, > but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action > about these issues. He shows us that there really is something we can do and > helps us to see how we can enact change. MediaPost Communications' Marketing Daily published an article called \\"What Marketers Can Learn from John Oliver\\", in which James G. Brooks, Jr. complimented Oliver's ability to encourage audience participation. He wrote, \\"Jeff trended worldwide. This kind of reaction is ideal for any marketing campaign.\\" Alex Frail of The Massachusetts Daily Collegian said, \\"One of his funnier bits, Jeff the Diseased Lung, took aim at the tobacco industry; landed on cigarette packs throughout Australia and on billboards throughout Uruguay; and delivered t-shirts to Togo. The power to spark a movement like Jeff the Diseased Lung isn't shared by Oliver's contemporaries.\\" Jeffrey Wasserman, vice president and director of RAND Health, opined: \\"John Oliver's 'Jeff' character is of course a mockery of an iconic figure, the Marlboro Man, whose legacy turned out to be cruelly ironic. As Oliver noted in his show, four former Marlboro men died of smoking-related causes. Let's hope that 'Jeff' going viral causes current and prospective smokers‚Äîmainly teens and preteens‚Äîto recognize cigarette smoking for what it is: the most deadly habit.\\" In July 2015, Slant Magazine Julia Pressman describes the \\"Tobacco\\" segment in her article \\"The British Dude Who Is Winning America's War on Bullshit\\", in which she features five ways Oliver \\"has owned 2015 thus far\\". The website Inverse included the February 15 segment, the second most effective from the show's second season, saying it \\"may be the most lasting of the entire year\\". Furthermore, the website's Matthew Strauss wrote, \\"Jeff shows up when you Google Image-search 'Marlboro'; he's on bus stops in Uruguay; and he's on t-shirts in Togo. Jeff is an icon. Oliver hasn't taken down Big Tobacco, but he sure didn't make them look too good.\\" In August, the Los Angeles Times named Oliver, and costume designer Mikaela Wohl, winners in the \\"Costume designer's quietest cry for help\\" category for the paper's 2015 Envy Awards, a parody of the annual Emmy Awards. Randee Dawn complimented both for their hard work and humor, but said Wohl's work on \\"amazing\\" costumes, such as Jeff and Russian Space Sex Gecko, distracted her from using her \\"creative energies\\" for dressing Oliver. Response by Philip Morris International Philip Morris International issued a statement which read in part: > On February 15, 2015, the 'Last Week Tonight with John Oliver' show > dedicated a significant portion of its program to our company [...] Last > Week Tonight with John Oliver is a parody show, known for getting a laugh > through exaggeration and presenting partial views in the name of humor.

And, like any other company with a > responsibility to its business partners, shareholders and employees, we ask > only that laws protecting investments, including trademarks, be equally > applied to us. The statement also provided readers with a \\"balanced view\\", and facts about the issues raised by Oliver, including the company's marketing practices and \\"approach to regulation\\". Philip Morris included links to its \\"Be Marlboro\\" campaign, which is \\"aimed at competing for existing adult smoker market share\\", reasons why the company is challenging Australia and Uruguay's censorship of its trademarks, and \\"facts about smoking prevalence in Australia after the introduction of plain packaging\\". Chris Morran of Consumerist said Philip Morris did a \\"really poor job of trying to defend its actions\\". He wrote, \\"[...] this should be where the very serious folks at Philip Morris go point by point and explain where Oliver exaggerated and embellished, but they don't. It's a classic non-response in which the accused tried to undercut the accuser's argument by claiming he can't possibly be providing the truth.\\" He noted that Philip Morris does not deny making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company: \\"[expects] to be taken seriously when it readily admits that the products it sells are 'harmful to health'\\". Furthermore, Chris Morran takes aim at the company's claim that it \\"[supports] and [complies] with thousands of regulations worldwide\\", writing: > [...] the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations. It only > supports the ones it can't fight in a courtroom. Once it loses a battle ‚Äì or > realizes a battle can't be won ‚Äì then suddenly Big Tobacco, just like every > other heavily regulated industry, claims to support and abide by the rules. Finally, he said of the statement's final sentence: \\"That's honestly the best Philip Morris and Big Tobacco can come up with ‚Äì We've spent a lot of money and have a lot of investors so please don't mess with our packaging because it might cause us to earn smaller profits [...] It's an argument that might be tenable if cigarettes did anything other than poison the people who buy them ‚Äì or live in the same house with them.\\" See also * Cigarette packets in Australia * Prevalence of tobacco consumption References External links * Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Season 2 Episode 26 on HBO ** Ep. 26 Clip: Big Tobacco's Still At It on HBO  * 2015 American television episodes Advertising and marketing controversies American mascots Cartoon mascots Criticisms of companies Fictional anthropomorphic characters Fictional body parts Fictional cowboys and cowgirls Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Male characters in television Philip Morris USA Smoking in the United States Television characters introduced in 2015 Tobacco advertising characters ","title":"Tobacco (Last Week Tonight)"},{"id":"48632278","title":"Josh Hawley"},{"id":"48632283","text":"Andreas Randel (6 October 1806 ‚Äì 27 October 1864) was a Swedish composer and violinist.

Biography Camillo Biagio Capizucchi (or Cappisucchi) was born in Rome in 1616.Nitti (1975) Being one of the nine children (three boys and six girls, all of the latter becoming nuns) of marquess Paolo Capizucchi and Ortensia Marescotti, he was a scion of the noble Capizucchi family, one of the oldest families of the Roman nobility. After starting his studies at the Collegio Romano, on 8 June 1630 he entered the Dominican Order in the convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, changing his first name in Raimondo when he was ordained priest. One year later he took the votes. In 1644 he became doctor of Theology, and was nominated coadjutor of Vincenzo Candido, Master of the Sacred Apostolic Palace (that is, leading Theologian of the Holy See) and former prior of his monastery. As a student, he was chosen to hold the yearly panegyric (Encomium of St. Thomas Aquinas) in front of the College of Cardinals in the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, a very old tradition of Angelicum University which still takes place each 7 March, the old feast of the Saint. Under the pontificates of Alexander VII (r. 1655-67) and Clement IX (r. 1667-69), he held various positions in the Roman Curia: in 1650 he was appointed secretary of the Sacred Congregation of the Index, in December 1651 he became examiner of the candidate bishops, and from November 1654, after the death of Candido, he was Master of the Sacred Apostolic Palace. In 1663 Capizucchi was sacked from the latter position by Alexander VII, because he had allowed a publication critical of the pope. Afterwards, he secluded himself for the next 10 years in his monastery, writing books on theological issues, until in 1673 he was reinstated in his former position with a papal bull by pope Clement X (r. 1670‚Äì76). The same pope appointed him member with voting rights of the Congregations of the Holy Office, of the Rites, of the Indulgences, of the Index and for bishops. As leading theologian of the church, in those years Capizucchi exercised a deep influence over Catholic theological positions, for example allowing the publication of the Exposition de la doctrine de l'√©glise catholique sur les mati√®res de controverse by Bossuet. Following the position of pope Innocent XI (r. 1676‚Äì89) he condemned probabilism, but at first he was fascinated by quietism as preached in Rome by the Spanish mystic Miguel de Molinos: in 1675 Capizucchi approved the publishing of de Molinos main work, the Spiritual Guide but, after his arrest in 1685, as cardinal Inquisitor he stuck to the harsh line of the pope against this doctrine and the Aragonese preacher, who died in 1696 in the prison of the Holy Office. Pope Innocent XI elevated him to the rank of cardinal in the consistory of 1 September 1681 with the title of cardinal priest of Santo Stefano al Monte Celio; six years later he opted for the title of Santa Maria degli Angeli. Capizucchi participated in the conclave of 1689 and was among those considered eligible candidates. He did not participate in the conclave of 1691, because he was already seriously ill. He died on 20 April 1691 at the age of 75, before the end of the conclave. Works and patronage Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome, at Capizucchi's time main center of the Dominican Order. The panegyric on Saint Thomas Aquinas given by Capizucchi in front of the convened Cardinals in Santa Maria sopra Minerva (Oratio panegyrica in laudem Sancti Thomae Aquinatis) is his earliest surviving work. As a theologian, his major work, dedicated to Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici, is Controversiae theologicae selectae, scholasticae, morales, dogmaticae, scripturales, ad mentem D. Thomae Aquinatis ... resolutae, first published in 1670. This is a miscellanea of 28 theological problems, solved according to the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas. Among others, Capizucchi wrote a treatise about probabilism, De opinione probabili, and a history of his family, Historia della famiglia Capizucchi. As a patron of the arts, in 1685 Cardinal Capizucchi commissioned the decoration by Mattia de Rossi of the chapel of San Paolo in the church of Santa Maria in Campitelli, giuspatronato of his family since 1390, where he was buried.

It is an adaptation of Pavel Bazhov's stories \\"The Stone Flower\\" and its sequel \\"The Master Craftsman\\". It was released by Sverdlovsk Film Studio in 1977. The film combined stop motion and live action scenes. It was narrated by Y. Puzyrev, with the music composed by Vladislav Kazenin. The Stone Flower is a part of the animated film series made at Sverdlovsk Film Studio from the early 1970s to early 1980s, on time for the 100th anniversary since the birth of Pavel Bazhov. The series included the following films: Sinyushka's Well (1973), The Mistress of the Copper Mountain (1975), The Malachite Casket (1976), The Stone Flower (1977), Podaryonka (based on \\"Silver Hoof\\", 1978), Golden Hair (1979), and The Grass Hideaway (1982).  Plot summary  The plot of The Stone Flower closely follows Pavel Bazhov's story of the same name. An unreliable and forgetful young boy Danilo is sent to study under the old stone craftsman Prokopych. He quickly surpasses his teacher and becomes the amazing worker. He can masterfully carve stone figures and create intricate designs from gemstones. The landlord orders him to make a stone cup. Danilo works on it for a long time, but he feels that his flower cup \\"is not alive\\" and the stone loses its beauty when he works with it. Danilo goes to the Mistress of the Copper Mountain and asks her to show him the Stone Flower. The legends say that those who see the legendary Flower start to understand the beauty of stone, but never return from the Mistress's domain. The Mistress grants his request. Danilo looks at the Flower and realizes that he could never find the perfect stone for it. He goes back home, destroys his cup and leaves. The second part is based on Pavel Bazhov's \\"The Master Craftsman\\". Danilo's fianc√©e Katyenka misses him and refuses to marry anyone else. She believes that he will come back from the Copper Mountain. One day Katyenka meets the Mistress herself and asks her to return Danilo to the village. The Mistress arranges a meeting between them and presents Danilo with a choice: \\"If you go with her you forget all that is mine, if you remain here, then you must forget her and all living people\\". Danilo chooses to return with Katyenka. He becomes a well known craftsman, \\"The Mountain Craftsman\\".

He avoids photographs and does not discuss his personal life. His drawings influenced gay culture through graphics made for famous nightclubs including the Mineshaft and his influence on artists such as Robert Mapplethorpe. Much censored, he has remained a shadowy figure saying that his drawings \\"defined who I became\\" and that there are \\"no other 'truths' out there\\". Early life and work Abandoned at birth, his real name and exact birthday are unknown, but references indicate a date in the 1940s. His childhood was spent as a ward of the state on a farm in a small northeastern town.Correspondence with British artist Guy Burch, a friend of Mapplethorpe subject Ossie Clark, regarding Bill Ward. He ran away to New York as a teenager in the 1950s, where he lived among beatniks and on the streets of Greenwich Village. While still in his teens he became the prot√©g√© of a fashion designer, who paid for two years of study at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. He later worked there in fashion illustration and commercial art, a career that brought him to London and Paris in the late 1960s, while maintaining an apartment on Saint Mark's Place in Manhattan's East Village. In Paris and London, \\"his fondest memories ... [were] the 'Cottages', the t-rooms, the public pissoirs, temples conceived and existing solely to bring relief to the male member, not distinguishing between straight or gay, and unconcerned with superficial conditions like color or religion, or how old or young, how pretty or ugly, how rich or poor the cock is.\\"Anacabe, p. [2]. Career before 1980 Disillusioned with commercial art, he dropped out for several years but re- emerged in the 1970s as one of the leading figures visualizing the fetish and S&M; subculture in New York and later San Francisco. He was much influenced, he said, by his chance discovery of a probably bootleg magazine of the drawings of Tom of Finland, which \\"irrevocably changed his life.\\" The depiction of men \\"having sex with men, passionately and enthusiastically\\" \\"spoke to him in a way no lover or anonymous stranger ever had.\\"Bo Tobin Anacabe, \\"Rex in the Back Room,\\" in Rex Verboten!(prohibited), Berlin, Bruno Gm√ºnder, 2012, , pp. [3-4]. His distinctively styled black-and-white pen-and- ink drawings quickly became synonymous with an emerging S&M; graphic idiom that, in addition to Tom of Finland, included Dom Orejudos (aka Etienne and Stephen), Steve Masters ('Mike' Miksche, born David Leo Miksche, 1925-1964), and Luger (Jim French (photographer), born 1932). The raw sexual energy of REX's early drawings resonated with a leather scene that was just emerging in Greenwich Village, Chelsea and the meatpacking district (see Mineshaft). The illusiveness of all the artists was deliberate because explicit sexual art, particularly homosexual in subject, was illegal, framed in vague language and enforced via contradictory judgments before the Stonewall riots. He said \\"I signed myself REX because it was non-specific and untraceable in those days by the cops\\". Although explicit nudes aimed at gay men would become more permissible, conservative and homophobic social culture of the era still meant that involvement with gay pornography could have serious consequences. As a freelance artist, initially working for pornographic series of Rough Trade pulp books (1972) illustrated with 12 images for each story, he produced poster commissions for a number of leather shops and gay bars around the US. His most famous works from this period were created for the notorious and legendary New York sex club the Mineshaft. The three posters and T-shirts he created for the club were sold in the tens of thousands during the 13 years of the club's existence and feature in the film Cruising (night interiors were filmed elsewhere, but recreated the club's interiors and include Rex posters). His illustrations reflected the sexual activities and extreme end of newly empowered pre-AIDS gay community and celebrated the gay bathhouse culture blatantly and without apology. Other commissions included the 1976 poster for the pioneering sex boutique the Pleasure Chest (a sex shop) which led to his work appearing on early covers for the fledgling S&M; orientated Drummer magazine in 1977 and to advertisements for a brand of poppers, BOLT, in 1980.Tadvertisements reproduced in Anacabe, pp. [2] and [7]. Commuting between New York and San Francisco, REX also produced posters, catalogues and calendars for The Trading Post, considered the first gay department store (1978 to 1981).  Later career  On July 1, 1981 REX opened his own gallery, Rexwerk, in his South of Market (SOMA) studio on Hallam Street in San Francisco. Only ten days later it was destroyed in a fire started at The Barracks bathhouse that was undergoing renovation across the street. The fire could not have come at a worse time, for July 1981 was also the same month the first case of what a year later was called AIDS was diagnosed in the city of San Francisco. His commercial work and original art nonetheless continued to appear as regular features in sexual magazines such as Manifest, Just Men, Torso, Inches, Uncut, and In Touch. Other erotic artists such as Allen J ('A.Jay') Shapiro (died 1987), Harry Bush (1925‚Äì1994), and British artist Bill Wardsee Comics Unmasked Art and Anarchy in the UK, Paul Gravett & John Harris Dunning, British Library, 2014, and http://www.guyburch.co.uk/?p=2662 were colleagues. Later commissions included posters for the gay bars The Lure in New York and The Eagle in Washington DC, and the original The Saint (club) parties. When the AIDS pandemic emerged, the increasingly negative attitude towards the sexually liberated scene in both San Francisco and New York led to panic measures from civic authorities and calls from within the gay community to suppress and discourage sexual permissiveness and promiscuity, so prominently a feature of REX's work. Rather than submit to what he regarded as the resulting suffocating censorship, and increasingly depressed by the deaths from AIDS of nearly all his contemporaries, REX stopped publishing his work for several years. In 1992 he returned to New York and opened a 'by appointment only' private gallery called The Secret Museum at 218 Madison Avenue until the events of 9/11 closed down Manhattan's economy. In early 2002 he returned full-time to San Francisco where he had maintained a room over the Zeitgeist Bar on Valencia Street during his bi-coastal years between Manhattan and San Francisco (1976‚Äì2010). Disheartened by the conservative trend and lack of opportunities open to him in what he saw as an increasingly 'Politically Correct' America, he moved to Europe in 2010 to live and work in Amsterdam.  Standalone works  REX published three 8- by 11-inch, 36-page bound portfolios of his black-and-white ink drawings entitled MannspielenVol 1 ‚Äì 1975 & Vol 2 ‚Äì 1976 (Man Games). The increasingly conservative political climate meant newsstands refused to sell them and from the start of the 1980s, his main source of income came from his mail-order business called 'Drawings by Rex', which issued privately printed, unbound portfolios of hard-core images. Beginning with Icons (1977) a series of portfolios were advertised. Rarely shown or seen in their entirety, these carefully considered and structured sets are diminished in isolation or redacted details. Most artists of the era issued photographic prints, not art prints. The only comparable previous works of this type were the commercially made lithographic prints of George Quaintance who also independently marketed his in the early 1950s. His series of 8- by 10-inch, 12-print unbound portfolios were entitled (chronologically) Rexwerk, Uncut, Undercover, Armageddon, Scorpio, Rexland, Legends and Rex Sex-Freak Circus. The unbound format proved popular with buyers who had been frustrated for the need to dismantle the earlier bound book format collections to frame their favourite images. Rex's drawings, made over months, defy the throw-away nature of most pure pornography and are more akin to a graphic novel, gay comics, and the Japanese tradition of shunga prints. The 'standalone' portfolio images are highly polished and sophisticated, akin to the work of Franz von Bayros (1866‚Äì1924), known for his scandalous Tales from the Dressing Table portfolio. The mood of REX's flophouse interiors find parallels in the private edition of Jean Genet's verses for Parade, illustrated with twenty explicitly homoerotic lithographs of drawings by Roland Caillaux (1905‚Äì1977). Reception and exhibitions Robert Mapplethorpe knew REX and was attracted to his hard-core imagery relating to the Mineshaft. The photographer developed a photographic portfolio that reflected the same themes and, like Rex, had strong links with the West Coast fetish scene (they both had work published by Drummer magazine editor Jack Fritscher). The photographer was more focused on Los Angeles whilst Rex preferred San Francisco. His work secured an invitation in April 1978 from Robert Opel to have a one-man exhibit at his newly opened Fey Wey Gallery on Harrison Street in San Francisco. REX's hyper-masculine men of this period were best described by Jack Fritscher, who was also one of Mapplethorpe's lovers, who met Rex in person for the first time at the opening: Like Mapplethorpe's pictures, any exhibition of such scenes, which also include occasionally imagery suggesting bestiality, urolagnia and sexual involvement with boys, are rare and dogged by controversy. In 1985 Rex was selected as one of the city's \\"100 Most Influential Artists\\" and shown as part of the Mayor's Art Gala.Verbotten, Bruno Gmunder Verlag, 2012, He was represented by a work entitled 'Dogtreats' which drew immediate press condemnation in the San Francisco Chronicle. Richard D. Mohr (Department of Philosophy at University of Illinois) struggled to find a publisher for Gay Ideas: Outing and Other Controversies (1994) specifically because it included work by Rex.Richard D. Mohr, \\"Gay Ideas: Outing and Other Controversies\\" (1994), discussed in 'America the Philosophical' by Carlin Romano. Romano relates how Mohr's scholarly book was rejected by a series of publishers, both commercial (including the publishers of Madonna's Sex book) and university presses, who objected to images of REX's being included. Richard Goldstein, writing in Village Voice, condemned the sexual activities of the fetish community and what he called its 'Naziphile' sympathies, pointing to Rex's work as evidence.Village Voice, April 7, 1998 There have been few publicly accessible exhibitions of the artist's work as a result, although he has found a more accepting climate in Amsterdam. Cultural impact and legacy A hardcover book of fifty drawings (Rexwerk) was published in Paris in 1986 by Les Pirates Associes, a private press run by photographers Ralf Marsault and Heino Muller,Les Pirates Associes, Paris in 1986; and Bruno Gmunder issued a book retrospective 'Verboten' in 2012 (the more controversial images were not included in this edition reflecting more nervousness around the subjects). A retrospective 'Persona Non Grata' was held at the nascent Leslie Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art's early Prince's Street Address in 1994 (Rex's work is held by the Museum), but the complex and compelling imagery of the late 1980s and early 1990s in particular is still largely ignored and invisible in the mainstream art world (Sex Freak Circus was shown for one night only on March 7, 2013 under the auspices of the Lohman Foundation and The Saint nightclub). In a book about his friend the Photographer David HurlesSpeeding, the Old Reliable Photos of David Hurles, text and design by Rex, Green Candy Press, 2005, Rex discussed what he regarded as the hypocritical attitude towards his brand of gay erotica, over \\"cookie cutter nudes\\" and \\"antiseptic, nonthreatening males posed in luxurious settings ... an idealised homoerotism with which viewers could feel at ease.\\" He exhibited with CNCPT13 in Amsterdam and Uncle Crickey's Closet in San Francisco. The artist lives and works in both Amsterdam and the USA, and maintains a pay-to-view website. An exhibition of his work took place during Folsom Europe in Berlin in September 2016.

Early life Frances Alexander was born on June 16, 1919 in Salem, Massachusetts to Edward and Nora Flynn. She grew up in Danvers, Massachusetts and graduated from Holten High School in 1937. In 1942 she married Albert Alexander, an engineer from Beverly, Massachusetts. The couple moved to Beverly in 1946. The Alexanders had four children before they divorced. Alexander worked sporadically as a secretary for General Electric for several years and then worked in one of the company's factories during World War II. After the war she worked at the Humpty Dumpty Nursery School in Beverly and later founded her own school, also in Beverly. Mrs. Alexander's School was originally located on the first floor of her home, but two years after its founding, Alexander relocated the growing daycare to a large, abandoned mansion overlooking Beverly Harbor. Alexander remained proprietor of Mrs. Alexander's School until she sold it in 2004 to a former assistant. Political career In 1969, Alexander was part of the effort to bring kindergarten to the city's schools. Later that year she was elected to the Beverly School Committee. Alexander remained on the committee until 1976 when she became a member of the Beverly Board of Aldermen. She remained on the board for six years. In 1977 and 1979 she topped the ticket and as a result became the President of the Board of Aldermen. She was the first woman to serve in this position. In 1981, Alexander unsuccessful challenged incumbent Mayor Peter Fortunato. She was the only female candidate for Mayor in Massachusetts that year. In 1982, Alexander was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. During her tenure in the House, Alexander worked to establish the Beverly Senior Center, bring about construction of the Veterans Memorial Bridge between Beverly and Salem, and pass domestic violence legislation. As a member of the Commerce Committee, she worked on small business legislation. After fifteen people were killed in a fire in a Beverly boarding house, Alexander wrote a bill to require sprinkler systems in boarding houses that accommodated six or more people. The bill passed in 1986. Alexander also worked on an unsuccessful effort to get a new North Shore Community College campus built in Beverly. In 1990, Alexander was considered one of the most likely incumbents to be defeated, however the race between her and Republican newcomer James R. Henry became close after Henry made several misstatements about his educational and professional background. Henry defeated Alexander 8,535 (51.6%) votes to 8,009 (48.4%). Alexander believed that the slow pace of the bridge project might have contributed to her defeat. Later life and death From 1992 to 2003, Alexander was a member of the board of trustees at Endicott College. In this position she helped oversee the expansion of the college from a two-year all-girls school with 400 students to a four-year co-ed university attended by over 2,000 students. She also served on the board of directors of the North Shore Music Theatre, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, the Beverly Preschool, the Girdler House, and the North Shore Chamber of Commerce. In 2004, she sold her home in Beverly and moved to Brooksby Village, a senior housing complex in Peabody, Massachusetts. On May 15, 2010, Alexander died at Beverly Hospital following a heart attack.

History  The shed was built on a plot north of Plodder Lane (now the B6199) and Plodder Lane station. The engine shed, turntable, coaling and watering facilities were on the western side of the line, with a goods shed and yard on the eastern side. The shed was built in Ramsbottom's hipped-roof style and could accommodate twelve locomotives. In 1890 work started to enlarge the shed's facilities. A six road shed in the standard northlight style was built adjoining the original engine shed, more than doubling the covered storage capacity. The turntable was moved to accommodate it and its tracks and the coaling and watering plant were replaced by a larger version. Minor adjustments were made in later years, but the basic facilities put in place in the 1890s hardly changed until closure in 1954. In the 1930s the roof and one wall of the original shed were demolished as life expired and not replaced. The hand-operated 42-foot turntable was replaced by a 60-foot vacuum-operated version in 1938. During World War II an air raid shelter was dug and a distinctive aircraft spotter's hut was erected on top of the water tank. Passenger services were reduced during the Second World War and thereafter. The Great Moor St to Manchester service took more than twice as long as the service from Bolton Trinity Street and intermediate traffic was slight, some with rail alternatives available such as at Walkden. The route to Kenyon Junction served small communities which either had other rail routes nearby or had more frequent and convenient buses. Bolton Great Moor St closed to regular passenger services in March 1954. Freight traffic was undergoing gradual decline and combined with the end of passenger workings left Plodder Lane shed with no role which could not be filled by other sheds such as Patricroft. Plodder Lane shed closed in October 1954. The shed buildings and Plodder Lane station were demolished although the shed's water tank - minus lookout post - survived until the 1960s. The goods facilities on the other side of the tracks remained open until 30 January 1965. All former LNWR lines in the Bolton area north of Howe Bridge and Atherton were closed by 6 January 1969.

She primarily translates English plays of Canadian origin into French. Her work is described as being \\"faithful to the original with an unostentatious use of Quebec idiom\\".  Biography  Warda was born in Cairo, Egypt, but immigrated to Montr√©al, Quebec, Canada with her parents at the age of 9. She first learned English from watching Happy Days on television. She graduated from the Universit√© de Montr√©al with a degree in English literature. At the time, she did not intend to pursue a career in translation. In 1991, she began working as an assistant at the Th√©√¢tre de Quat‚ÄôSous under Pierre Bernard. Bernard persuaded her to translate her first play, Brilliant Traces by Cindy Lou Johnson. This was a success, earning her a Prix de la critique nomination from the Association qu√©b√©coise des critiques de th√©√¢tre. She went on to translate several other plays during her tenure, such as Cindy Lou Johnson‚Äôs The Years (Les ann√©es), Brad Fraser‚Äôs The Ugly Man (L'homme laid), and Philip Ridley‚Äôs Pitchfork Disney. She left the Th√©√¢tre de Quat'Sous in 2001. In 2002, she began working for the National Theatre School of Canada, holding the position of Associate Director General. Warda was nominated for the Governor General‚Äôs Award in 2001 for her translation of George F. Walker‚Äôs Suburban Motel as Motel de passage, and later won a Governor General‚Äôs Award in 2011 for her translation of Greg MacArthur‚Äôs The Toxic Bus Incident as Toxique ou l‚Äôincident dans l‚Äôautobus. Warda later stated that she had never expected to win, as she had not expected a play to be chosen for the award. In 2015, Warda‚Äôs translation into French of Erin Shields‚Äô If We Were Birds was used in a production of the play directed by Genevi√®ve L. Blais.

History  In the period of 2004-2014, Amstor retail chain became one of the top national retail chains in Ukraine. It included 38 supermarkets and shopping centers in 7 regions. One of its competitive advantages was high-quality and healthy products of own production - natural sausages, meat and fish delicacies, exclusive pastry, unique selection of breads baked right in the store and restaurant level cookery. Amstor won the confidence of buyers due to its particular attention to cleanliness and careful quality control. According to the Ukraine consulting company GT Partnersn in 2012, Amstor entered the top 10 food operators in Ukraine: the chain was ranked eighth in turnover and ninth in total retail space. In 2014, the total retail space accounted to 103 thousand square meters and the total area of all the shopping centers more than 300 thousand square meters. Ukrainian businessman Vladimir Vagorovsky was the founder of Amstor retail chain. On August 28, 2003, the first grocery hypermarket Amstor opened in Donetsk. By the end of 2007, there were 19 Amstor shops in the East of Ukraine, 22 shopping centers were under development. In the meanwhile, the company was developing the format of a grocery hypermarket with the sales area of 3000‚Äì6000 m2. By the end of 2009, Amstor chain included 26 shopping malls in 5 regions of Ukraine with total area of 305,8 thousand square meters: *Donetsk region ‚Äì 15 *Zaporozhye ‚Äì 7 *Nikolaiev ‚Äì 2 *Luhansk ‚Äì 1 *Poltava ‚Äì 1 In 2009, there were more than 8000 employees and the turnover of the company reached 3 billion UAH. Starting from 2009, approximately 280 million UAH (about 30 million USD) of own funds of the company were invested into development. In 2012, Amstor chain became national. On December 20 Amstor entered the market of Kiev with a new format ‚Äì the first in Ukraine \\"supermarket of taste\\". In the following two years 2 more \\"supermarkets of taste\\" were opened in the capital. The retail area of one \\"supermarket of taste\\" was 1000-2500 m2. In October 25, 2013, Amstor was opened in Dnepropetrovsk. In 2014, it had 8 successful supermarkets in Donetsk, Makeyevka, Svyatogorsk and Yasinovataya. These were Amstor supermarkets with retail area of 200-600 sq. m. in densely populated areas of the cities. It was present in 38 shopping centers in seven regions of Ukraine. It was planned to open new Amstors in many other cities of Ukraine in 2014. But the beginning of the antiterrorist operation in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, as well as a corporate conflict of the major shareholder \\"Smart Holding\\" (70% stock) with the minor shareholder Vladimir Vagorovskyi around Amstor, which began in December 2014, have drastically changed the Amstor retailer history.  Attraction of Smart- Holding into Amstor business  The economic recession of 2008 along with rapid devaluation of the domestic currency and plunge in customers‚Äô purchasing ability in the retailer's basic territory placed Amstor on the edge of bankruptcy. To save the business, business partners Shifrin and Vagorovskiy turned to Vadym Novynskyi for support. They offered him 70% of Amstor's stock in exchange for infusion of working capital and aid in restructuring of the company's excessive credit portfolio. The beginning of the cooperation was the $3 million stabilization loan provided (or given) by Novynskyi's company Smart-Holding. In consequence of the cooperation deal, Shifrin and Vagorovskiy retained 15% of the company's stock each. In 2009-2011, Novynskyi injected into Amstor about $30.5 million in cash. Additionally, Smart-Holding concluded suretyship agreements to $50 million under the company's loans with the banks.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è —Ç–æ—Ä–≥–æ–≤–æ–π —Å–µ—Ç–∏ ¬´–ê–º—Å—Ç–æ—Ä¬ª, –∏–ª–∏ –ö—Ç–æ –æ–Ω ‚Äì –º–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä –í–∞–≥–æ—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π? The mentioned funds were considered by the major shareholder as a necessary loan for the development of the business group. In addition, the undistributed profit, the biggest part of which belonged to Smart-Holding, was reinvested into the retailer's development. Smart-Holding did not ever receive dividends from Amstor's business operations.  New impulse in Amstor chain\`s development  With support from Smart-Holding in 2009-2011, the financial condition of Amstor chain became stable, its major credit portfolio was restructured, and the value of its bonds for 2010-2013, mainly nominated in US dollars, was reduced by $55 million. From 2010, the retail chain of Amstor, being purely regional operator based in Donetsk and Zaporozhye regions of Ukraine before, started its expansion to other regions of Ukraine. In 2012, Amstor's first supermarket in Kyiv was opened. Later, two more Amstors were opened there. The retailer gained the status of a national operator. During 2009-2013, the number of branded Amstor outlets grew from 23 to 38. Further penetration into the market of the western Ukraine was planned. The total value of all the company's assets at the beginning of 2014 amounted to about $200 million (the exchange rate being 8 UAH per 1 USD). Amstor consolidated its position amidst top 10 retailers of Ukraine. With consent of the majority shareholder of Smart-Holding, Vladimir Vagorovskiy remained the actual executive officer of Amstor retail group. His younger brother, Alexandr, was nominated as acting CEO of the chain. Smart-Holding participated in the development of the company as a core investor that made strategic decisions regarding the chain's development and managed Amstor company through its representatives in the Supervisory Board. At the same time, throughout the period of partnership with Smart-Holding, Vagorovskiy continued to manage the chain single-handedly, which later resulted in the conflict between the shareholders of Amstor retail chain.  Corporate conflict  The conflict between the majority shareholder of Amstor, Smart-Holding (70% stock), and the minority shareholder, ex-manager of Amstor Vladimir Vagorovskiy (15% stock), was caused by the latter wishing to withdraw the majority shareholder from participation in Amstor's business. The scheme of Smart-Holding's ouster from participation in the business was as follows: In March 2014, Vladimir Vagorovskiy, without the consent of the senior partner, founded Amstor Trade LLC, which according to his scheme was meant to become a new parent company of the retail group, to which not only the business of the retailer, but also all the real estate and transport belonging to Amstor would gradually be transferred. The name of the new company was almost identical to that founded and accorded with the majority shareholder half a year prior. The only difference was the absence of a hyphen in the name. The legal entity accorded with Smart-Holding was Amstor-Trade LLC, whereas its fictitious equivalent was named Amstor Trade LLC. All this remitted attention of the majority shareholder and considerably eased accordance of Vagorovskiy's further steps. Throughout the year 2014, taking the advantage of making some decisions single-handedly, Vladimir Vagorovskiy carried out several transactions to put his plan of the business appropriation into effect. To fill up the capital of Amstor Trade LLC Vagorovskiy made several dubious fiscal transactions. One of them, for instance, was purchase of junk securities from Lancelot LLC to UAH15 million by Amstor Trade House upon Vagorovskiy's instruction.–ï–∫—Å-—É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—é—á—ñ \\"–ê–º—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∞\\" –í–∞–≥–æ—Ä–æ–≤—Å—å–∫—ñ –ø—ñ–¥–æ–∑—Ä—é—é—Ç—å—Å—è —É –Ω–µ–∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ö –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ü—ñ—è—Ö –∑ —Ü—ñ–Ω–Ω–∏–º–∏ –ø–∞–ø–µ—Ä–∞–º–∏ After several transactions made during just one day, the mentioned amount, finally reached the accounts of the newly founded Amstor Trade LLC in the form of a loan. At the same period, the Vagorovskiys created an artificial indebtedness of Amstor LLC in favour of Amstor Trade LLC. Amstor LLC possessed all the real estate belonging to the group of companies, in particular the trade outlets as the key assets. In the future, in case of Amstor LLC's bankruptcy, the new entity could claim its rights to all the shopping centres. Gradually, all the cash flows of the retail chain were transferred to Amstor Trade LLC. All the suppliers were made to work with the new company. Later on, shortly before the open stage of the corporate conflict, the Vagorovskiys brothers made a deal to ‚Äúsell‚Äù the Group's trademarks to the newly established companies controlled by them. During the same period, the inventory and equipment of Amstor supermarkets were ‚Äúsold‚Äù and ‚Äúre-registered‚Äù to these companies. Similar schemes were used when withdrawing vehicles and expensive special machinery that belonged to the retail chain.–≠–∫—Å-—É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—é—â–∏–µ \\"–ê–º—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∞\\" –ø—ã—Ç–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –∑–∞–≤–ª–∞–¥–µ—Ç—å –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–æ–º –∏ —Å–ø–µ—Ü—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏–∫–æ–π —Ä–∏—Ç–µ–π–ª–µ—Ä–∞, –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É—è –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –∏–∑ \\"–î–ù–†\\" Up to a certain moment, the minority shareholder could explain all these actions to Smart-Holding by allegedly accorded operations aimed at consolidation and enhancement of the business transparency. At the same time, the fiscal controllers from Smart-Holding were not given access to Amstor's financial statements. Eventually, the majority shareholder was completely disconnected from 1C enterprise accounting system.  Open stage of the corporate conflict  In November 2014, Smart-Holding noticed some photos of receipts from Amstor outlets located in the territory not controlled by Ukraine (ATO zone), from which ‚ÄúAmstor Trade House‚Äù name disappeared, and the VAT equalled to 0%. The majority shareholder ‚Äì Smart- Holding ‚Äì did not give its consent to any changes, though. Consequently, the operational activity of the retail chain, in particular, the financial and business activity of Vladimir Vagorovskiy, was subject to audit. It revealed that money from Amstor's accounts was transferred to some fake companies. For instance, V.Vagorovskiy used part of the money to buy an apartment in Grushevskogo street in Kyiv, an expensive car, etc. However, the essence of his plan was not only his personal enrichment, but also appropriation of the entire business despite the interests of other shareholders owning 85% stock in the retail chain. One part of Vagorovskiy's plot was Premiumtorg, a company founded in Donetsk in October 2014 that worked within the legal framework of Donetsk People's Republic (DPR or DNR). Receipts from the retailer's supermarkets, published in social media in December 2014 by ordinary customers, as well as other documents discovered later, during the search by militia in V. Vagorovskiy's premises, were evidence to that. The proceeds from these 18 outlets were not debited and were actually appropriated by the ex- managers.–í—ã—Ä—É—á–∫–∞ –∏–∑ —Å–µ—Ç–∏ –¢–¶ \\"–ê–º—Å—Ç–æ—Ä\\" –≤ –î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –Ω–µ –ø–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ —Å—á–µ—Ç–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∏–π –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—ã ‚Äì \\"–°–º–∞—Ä—Ç-–•–æ–ª–¥–∏–Ω–≥\\" When the majority shareholder revealed all these facts, Smart-Holding removed the Vagorovskiys from the management and assigned new managers to all the branches of Amstor chain. At the end of 2014, representatives of Smart-Holding attempted to enter Amstor supermarkets and announce changes, carry on the fiscal audit (primary documents) and audit of goods. However, armed people acting under command of the Vagorovskiys blocked access to the stores. All that led to suspension in the supermarkets‚Äô operations ‚Äì neither representatives of Smart-Holding nor the employees were allowed in.–≠–∫—Å-—É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—é—â–∏–π \\"–ê–º—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∞\\" —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–∞–µ—Ç –Ω–∞–ø–∞–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ –º–∞–≥–∞–∑–∏–Ω—ã —Å–µ—Ç–∏ The representatives of Smart-Holding received access to the stores only on 9 January 2015. Ten days were enough for the Vagorovskiys to cover up traces of embezzlement and not to let the auditors access the primary documents: IT infrastructure of Amstor was destroyed, servers were removed and carried away, labour books of employees disappeared, contacts of suppliers and accounting papers were destroyed.–ú–∞–≥–∞–∑–∏–Ω—ã \\"–ê–º—Å—Ç–æ—Ä\\" –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞—é—Ç —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—Ç—å  Amstor outlets in the ATO zone  18 stores of Amstor Retail Group are located in the ATO zone. For a long time they had worked under control of Vagorovskiy, who managed to make a deal with leaders of the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk. Later, Vagorovskiy was deprived of Amstor shops in the DNR (the so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DNR)) territory by local militants. Amstor Retail Group, operating in the territory of Ukraine and controlled by Smart-Holding, is planning to regain control over 18 stores in the ATO zone after the conflict in the East of Ukraine has been settled.  Current state of Amstor  During 2015, it took Smart-Holding considerable effort to stabilize the work of 20 stores in the territory controlled by Ukraine. More than UAH150 million was spent on that. All the employees of the supermarkets that were idle were paid salaries during the entire period. This was financial aid from the enterprises of Smart-Holding. During this time the IT infrastructure was restored, debts to the employees of Amstor were paid off, the question of indebtedness to Amstor's suppliers was settled. In July 2015, Smart-Holding and Fozzy Group reached an agreement to implement a joint project to fully restore the operations of Amstor retail chain. This related to the stores located beyond the territory of ATO (anti-terrorist operation). The project has been brought off and the stores have been restored. As of now they are operating under Silpo brand with Amstor shopping outlets preserving their original name.–°–º–∞—Ä—Ç-–•–æ–ª–¥–∏–Ω–≥ —ñ Fozzy Group –¥–æ–º–æ–≤–∏–ª–∏—Å—è –ø—Ä–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–∑–∞–ø—É—Å–∫ —Ç–æ—Ä–≥–æ–≤–æ—ó –º–µ—Ä–µ–∂—ñ \\"–ê–º—Å—Ç–æ—Ä\\" In addition to the anchor tenant Silpo, the stores of Amstor Retail Group have given space to numerous representatives of small and medium- size businesses. According to the information from Smart-Holding, the following outlets operate in Amstor retail chain as of the beginning of 2016: When the mentioned corporate conflict broke out, 14 out of 20 stores in the territory controlled by Ukraine were located in the shopping centers owned by Amstor, and six stores were placed on the rented area. After the corporate conflict was over and Smart-Holding regained control over the Group's stores as well as following the agreement on joint development of the retail chain with Fozzy Group, the situation is as follows: Previously rented areas: * Kiev, 3 supermarkets ‚Äì Silpos were opened in two of them, ATB-market was placed in the remaining one * Zaporozhye ‚Äì one supermarket Varus *Dnipro - one supermarket Silpo *Svyatogorsk ‚Äì one supermarket - closed Shopping centers operated by Amstor Retail Group: 11 shopping centers host Silpos: five shopping centers in Zaporozhye, three in Mariupol, one in Melitopol, Kramatorsk and Kremenchug. Another supermarket, in Nikolaev, with Silpo anchor tenant, is being prepared for opening. Supermarkets in Severodonetsk and Berdyansk are closed so far until the matter regarding indebtedness to VTB bank, in whose mortgage they are, is settled. 18 more stores are located in the ATO zone. Amstor Retail Group is planning to regain control over them after the conflict in the East of Ukraine has been settled. 11 out of the mentioned stores are located in the premises owned by Amstor Group.

Since 2012, ISIL has produced annual reports giving numerical information on its operations, somewhat in the style of corporate reports, seemingly in a bid to encourage potential donors. In 2014, the RAND Corporation analyzed ISIL's funding sources by studying 200 documents ‚Äî personal letters, expense reports and membership rosters ‚Äî captured from the Islamic State of Iraq (which included al-Qaeda in Iraq) by US forces in Iraq between 2005 and 2010. It found that over this period, outside donations amounted to only 5% of the group's operating budgets, with the rest being raised within Iraq. In the time period studied, cells were required to send up to 20% of the income generated from kidnapping, extortion rackets and other activities to the next level of the group's leadership. Higher-ranking commanders would then redistribute the funds to provincial or local cells which were in difficulties or which needed money to conduct attacks. The records show that the Islamic State of Iraq depended on members from Mosul for cash, which the leadership used to provide additional funds to struggling militants in Diyala, Salahuddin and Baghdad. In mid-2014, the Iraqi National Intelligence Service obtained information from an ISIL operative which revealed that the organisation had assets worth US$2 billion, making it the richest jihadist group in the world. About three- quarters of this sum is said to be represented by assets seized after the group captured Mosul in June 2014; this includes possibly up to US$429 million looted from Mosul's central bank, along with additional millions and a large quantity of gold bullion stolen from a number of other banks in Mosul. However, doubt was later cast on whether ISIL was able to retrieve anywhere near that sum from the central bank, and even on whether the bank robberies had actually occurred. Accessible via Google. According to a 2015 study by the Financial Action Task Force, ISIL's five primary sources of revenue are as follows (listed in order of significance): * proceeds from the occupation of territory (including control of banks, oil and gas reservoirs, taxation, extortion, and theft of economic assets) * kidnapping for ransom * donations by or through non-profit organizations * material support provided by foreign fighters * fundraising through modern communication networks Another 2015 analysis also contends that ISIL's financial strength is in a large part due to \\"fanatical spending discipline\\". The United States Department of State‚Äôs Rewards for Justice offers US$5 million for information leading to the disruption of the sale and/or trade of oil and antiquities by ISIS. Oil revenues Pictures show damage to the Gbiebe oil refinery in Syria following airstrikes by US and coalition forces. Exporting oil extracted from captured oilfields has brought in tens of millions of dollars for the Islamic State. A US Treasury official estimated in 2014 that ISIL earned US$1 million a day from the export of oil, much of which was sold illegally in Turkey. The same year, Dubai-based energy analysts put the combined oil revenue from ISIL's Iraqi-Syrian production as high as US$3 million per day. An accurate estimate of the Islamic State's true revenue from oil is difficult, as black market sales are difficult to trace.\\"Financing of the Terrorist Organisation Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),\\" 14. In 2014, the majority of the group's funding came from the production and sale of energy; it controlled around 300 oil wells in Iraq alone. At its peak, it operated 350 oil wells in Iraq, but lost 45 to foreign airstrikes. It had captured 60% of Syria's total production capacity (about one fifth of its total capacity had been in operation). Despite controlling large amounts of oil reserves and production facilities, ISIL lacked the \\"resources and technical capacities\\" to effectively utilize them.\\"Financing of the Terrorist Organisation Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),\\" 13. ISIL earned US$2.5 million a day by selling 50,000‚Äì60,000 barrels of oil daily. Foreign sales relied on a long-standing black market to export via Turkey. Many of the smugglers and corrupt Turkish border guards who helped Saddam Hussein to evade sanctions also helped ISIL to export oil and import cash. In 2015, after the fall of Tikrit, ISIL lost control of three large oil fields. Air strikes by the US-led coalition fighting ISIL and in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris, destroyed hundreds of trucks the Islamic State had been using to transport its oil. A study by the Center for Development and Strategy showed this was the preferred method of reducing ISIL's revenue, while minimizing total impact. Other energy sales include selling electric power from captured power plants in northern Syria; some of this electricity was sold back to the Syrian government. Sale of antiques and artifacts Sales of artifacts may be the second largest source of funding for ISIL. More than a third of Iraq's important sites are under ISIL's control. It looted the 9th century BC grand palace of the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II at Kalhu (Nimrud). Tablets, manuscripts and cuneiforms were sold, worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Stolen artifacts are smuggled into Turkey and Jordan. Abdulamir al-Hamdani, an archaeologist from Stony Brook University, has said that ISIL is \\"looting... the very roots of humanity, artefacts from the oldest civilizations in the world\\". It is difficult to accurately measure the revenue from artifacts, as they are primarily sold on the black market, but National Geographic estimates it may be in the tens of millions USD. As well as selling artifacts themselves, ISIL taxes traffickers smuggling them across ISIL's territory.\\\\----- \\"Financing of the Terrorist Organisation Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),\\" Financial Action Task Force, 2015, 16-17. Taxation and extortion Saddam- era Iraqi dinar note found on the body of a dead ISIL fighter. ISIL extracts wealth through taxation and extortion. Regarding taxation, Christians and foreigners are at times required to pay a tax known as jizya. The rate of jizya is determined by the income of the person, and it also serves as a protection contract involving harsh restrictions on non-Muslims. This tax has a historical foundation in the Quran and the original caliphate as a way to bring non-Muslims under the control of the spreading Empire.Revkin, Mara, \\"The Legal Foundations of the Islamic State,\\" The Brookings Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World, July 2016, 16; Gordon, Matthew S. The Rise of Islam. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2005. The Islamic State has issued several taxes in an effort to control the assets acquired by its fighters in battle. According to the Quran, one-fifth of the ghanima, or the spoils of war taken by Islamic State's fighters, must be given to the state, and IS is believed to be collecting this tax, known as khums, in Mosul. All fighters for Islamic State also pay tax on property taken as spoils of war. As well as these spoils of war, property taken peacefully, known as fay', is subject to a 20 percent tax. These taxes serve the dual purpose of bringing in revenue for the state while maintaining strict control over its fighters.Revkin, 20. While frowned upon, professions other than fighting jihad are necessary for the running of the state. Those who take up these professions must pay zakat, usually a 2.5% tax on an individual's total assets. Islamic State has also put in place the 'ushr tariff on imports and exports from their territory. All of these taxes imposed by Islamic State have some form of Quranic or historical basis except for the fay', giving the administration freedom of interpretation that could explain its higher rate.Revkin, 20-21. In addition, the group routinely practices extortion, by demanding money from truck drivers and threatening to blow up businesses, for example. Robbing banks and gold shops has been another source of income. The Iraq government indirectly finances ISIL, as it continues to pay the salaries of the thousands of government employees who continue to work in areas controlled by ISIL, which then confiscates as much as half of those Iraqi government employees' pay. Policemen, teachers, and soldiers who had worked for religiously inappropriate regimes are reportedly allowed to continue work if they pay for a repentance ID card that has to be annually renewed. Illegal drug trade According to Victor Ivanov, head of the Russian anti- drug agency, Islamic State, like Boko Haram, makes money through trafficking Afghan heroin through its territory. The annual value of this business may be up to $1 billion. Political scientist Colin P. Clarke of the RAND Corporation, writing after the end of the 2016‚Äì2017 Battle of Mosul in July 2017, stated that with ISIL's territorial losses causing declines in the organization's revenue from taxation of the local populations it once controlled, as well as from extortion from oil, gas, phosphate, and cement production, that the group would likely seek new revenue streams from drug trafficking. Agriculture The acreage between Tigris and Euphrates has produced half of Syria's annual wheat crop and a third of Iraq's. It is able to produce crops worth possibly US$200 million per year if properly managed, and the UN Food and Agricultural Organization believes that 40% of Iraq's wheat-producing land is under ISIL control.\\"Financing of the Terrorist Organisation Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),\\" 15. It is believed that ISIL confiscates wheat and barley crops as zakat, as well as farming equipment that is then rented back to farmers. The organization maintains strict control over the production and distribution of crops, effectively setting prices. Donations from Arab States of the Persian Gulf The State of Qatar has long been accused of acting as a conduit for the flow of funds to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. While there is no proof that the Qatari government is behind the movement of funds from the gas-rich nation to ISIL, it has been criticized for not doing enough to stem the flow of financing. Private donors within Qatar, sympathetic to the aims of radical groups such as al-Nusra Front and ISIL, are believed to be channelling their resources to support these organisations. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, a number of terrorist financiers have been operating in Qatar. Qatari citizen Abd al Rahman al Nuaymi has served as an interlocutor between Qatari donors and leaders of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). Nuaymi reportedly oversaw the transfer of US$2 million per month to AQI over a period of time. Nuaymi is also one of several of Qatar-based al- Qaeda financiers sanctioned by the U.S.Treasury in recent years. According to some reports, U.S. officials believe that the largest portion of private donations supporting ISIS and al-Qaeda-linked groups now comes from Qatar rather than Saudi Arabia. In August 2014, a German minister Gerd M√ºller accused Qatar of having links to ISIL, stating \\"You have to ask who is arming, who is financing ISIS (ISIL) troops. The keyword there is Qatar\\". Qatari foreign minister Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiyah stated: \\"Qatar does not support extremist groups, including [ISIL], in any way. We are repelled by their views, their violent methods and their ambitions.\\" Website The Daily Beast in June 2014 accused wealthy donors in Saudi Arabia and Qatar of having funded ISIL in the past. Iran and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have accused the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar of funding the group. Ahead of the pro-Iraq, anti-ISIL conference held in Paris on 15 September 2014, France's foreign minister acknowledged that a number of countries at the table had \\"very probably\\" financed ISIL's advances. According to The Atlantic, ISIL may have been a major part of Saudi Arabian Bandar bin Sultan's covert-ops strategy in Syria. There are sources, however, that stress that there is no evidence that ISIL has direct support from the Saudi government, and that such support would contradict the Saudi state's other actions regarding the group. Saudi Arabia considers ISIL an enemy that has carried out attacks on their soil. They have worked openly with the United States in the arming other rebel groups the US hopes will fight ISIL and retake territory in Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia has also developed its own counter-propaganda efforts in response to ISIL's recruitment. Unregistered charity organisations act as fronts to pass funds to ISIL; they disguise fundings for ISIL's operations as donations for \\"humanitarian charity\\". As they use aliases on Facebook's WhatsApp and Kik, the involved individuals and organisations are difficult to trace. Saudi Arabia therefore has imposed a blanket ban on unauthorised donations destined for Syria in order to stop such funding. Julian Assange claimed in an interview that Hillary Clinton's Clinton Foundation and ISIL both receive funding from the same sources in the Middle East, namely the government of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.Salon.com Leaked Hillary Clinton emails show U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar supported ISIS 2016/10/11 References Economy of the Middle East Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant activities ","title":"Finances of ISIL"},{"id":"48632817","text":"Paul Portier was a French cinematographer.Powrie & Rebillard p.224 He worked on around fifty films during his career.

He was expelled from the party in 1932 for supporting the Republican government, but was readmitted at the start of the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). During World War II (1939‚Äì45) he helped organize Spanish refugees in Spain as members of the French Resistance, then moved to Spain where he ran an underground newspaper. He was assassinated in 1945 on orders of the Communist Party of Spain on the grounds that his independent actions had endangered other communists. Early years (1899‚Äì1939) Gabriel Le√≥n Trilla was born in Valladolid in 1899. His father was an army colonel. He studied in Valladolid and Madrid, and earned a degree in humanities. He joined the Group of Socialist Students (Grupo de Estudiantes Socialistas, GES), which decided to support the Third International in October 1919. He moved to France in 1921 to avoid being drafted for the war in Morocco, and in Paris became one of the leaders of the Spanish communists. For a period he sympathized with Leon Trotsky. In 1924 Trilla became head of the secretariat of the Spanish communist groups in France. In 1925 Trilla was one of three leaders of the party. Jos√© Bullejos was secretary general, Trilla was secretary of agitation and propaganda and Luis Portela was organization secretary. Trilla represented the Communist Party of Spain (Partido Comunista de Espa√±a, PCE) in the Communist International (Comintern). He married Anastasia Filippovna Barmashova in Moscow. They had two daughters. The first died at the age of six months. The second was born in 1931. After General Jos√© Sanjurjo attempted a coup in Seville in August 1932 the PCE gave its support to the Republic. The Comintern denounced this stand, which it called \\"opportunism\\". As a result of this dispute between the PCE and Comintern, Bullejos was expelled from the leadership, as were Trilla, Manuel Adame and Etelvino Vega. Trilla was forced to leave his family behind when he left Moscow. Trilla was readmitted to the PCE in 1936. During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39) he again played a leadership role. World War II (1939‚Äì45) After the fall of the Republican government in 1939 thousands of Spanish refugees were held in camps in France. Jes√∫s Monz√≥n organized those who remained into rural labor groups in Vichy France. These became the basis for the Agrupaciones de Guerrilleros Espa√±oles (AGE), the Spanish maquis, which fought against the Germans. Monz√≥n worked with Trilla in reorganizing the PCE members and placing them in the French Resistance. Monz√≥n clandestinely entered Spain in the Spring of 1943. In late 1943 Trilla returned to Spain from Nazi-occupied France to work for the PCE in Madrid. Trilla and Monz√≥n were recalled to France in 1944, but both feared they would be killed and remained in Spain. From 1944‚Äì45 Trilla edited the clandestine paper Mundo Obrero (Workers' World) in Madrid. By the summer of 1944 the AGE veterans of the Spanish Republic's Popular Army had made a significant contribution to defeating the Germans in the south of France. The \\"Latin Americans\\" and \\"Russians\\" in the PCE leadership frowned on the independent action of the French PCE as \\"resisters\\". Monz√≥n made a failed attempt to start an insurrection against Francisco Franco through an invasion of the Val d'Aran in northern Spain by irregular forces in October 1944. He was accused by the party of collaborating with the enemy. In 1945 the guerrilla group of Cristino Garc√≠a, a hero of the French Resistance, was sent to Spain to assassinate Trilla. There is disagreement about who ordered the assassination. Sergio Villar cites Enrique L√≠ster, who blamed Santiago Carrillo and Dolores Ib√°rruri. Garc√≠a refused to carry out the order personally, because \\"he was a revolutionary and not a murderer\\". On 6 September 1945 Trilla went to a meeting with three comrades of the PCE in the Campo de las Calaveras, a former cemetery. It was a trap. Two of them held him while the third stabbed him to death. According to the party \\"Trilla acted on his own account as an authentic bandit; furthermore his work represented a risk for the underground organization and the security of many Communists. So he was executed by Cristino Garc√≠a's group.\\" Notes Sources      * 1899 births 1945 deaths Spanish communists ","title":"Gabriel Le√≥n Trilla"},{"id":"48632859","text":"Kharotabad () or Kili Khezi is a neighborhood of Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan.

Produced by Untrademarked Productions, the film was released by Synapse Films on August 12, 2015.  Plot  Small town journalist, Posey Mapleton, does a Special Report on Fantasites, a genetically-engineered parasite that allows users to once again dream - an ability they all lost 30 years ago. Seeing the new miracle product as a way escape his boring life, socially inept maintenance man, Charles, attempts to purchase Fantasites but discovers he can only afford the cheaper Economy version as opposed to the highly sought after Premium. When his Economy worms aren‚Äôt enough to impress his neighbor, Reed (a Premium user), Charles considers giving up Fantasites all together. But when a delivery of Premium worms are left outside Reed‚Äôs apartment, Charles decides to start swapping them for his undesired Economy worms. With the Premium Fantasites in his possession, Charles is finally able to live out his wildest fantasies. With a new found confidence, Charles‚Äô focus soon shifts from wanting Reed to be his friend to starting a romantic relationship with Reed‚Äôs live-in girlfriend, June. Out of pity, June pressures Reed into becoming friends with the lonely maintenance man. The plan backfires and Reed humiliates Charles at a dinner date that Charles had hoped would be only between himself and June. Completely heartbroken, Charles throws himself into Fantasites, continuing to steal from Reed and becoming more detached from others and more lost in his dreams. Soon, the harmful side effects and addictive nature of Fantasites become a national concern, and the worms are made illegal. Desperate to continue using, Charles turns to Reed who has found a way to continue getting Fantasites through an underground network. Hoping to continue to use worms and wanting to provide for June, who turns out is a fellow Fantasite addict suffering from withdrawals, Charles commits himself to a dangerous group of Fantasite-masked men. The group is run by Stephen, who has found a way to reclaim worms by smashing the skulls of users and re- selling the worms extracted from their brains. Believing that a home invasion on a house of high-class users will give him enough worms to escape with June for good, Charles takes Reed up on an offer for a final job. When the home invasion turns into a massacre, Reed steals the worms and leaves Charles to take the blame. When Charles attempts to reconnect with June and make their escape, she turns him down, knowing they‚Äôll eventually be tracked down. Not accepting this future, Charles returns to the apartment for June, not knowing that Stephen and his Fantasite-masked men had already found Reed and June. He arrives too late to save his love and decides to once more use a Fantasite and find her in his dreams.

Featuring newcomers Balakrishna Kola and Wamiqa Gabbi. The film is produced by Kola Bhaskar and has music composed by Amrit. Having had several false starts since 2006, the film released on 1 January 2016 to positive reviews.http://www.sify.com/movies/mesmerized-with-maalai-nerathu-mayakkam- selvaraghavan-news-tamil-pkympfcigieii.html The film was dubbed and released in Telugu as Nannu Vadili Neevu Polevule.http://www.123telugu.com/reviews/nannu-vadili-neevu-polevule-telugu- movie-review.html Plot The movie opens with Manoja (Wamiqa Gabbi) suffering from insomnia. Her ex-boyfriend Tarun (Sharran Kumar) tries to propose to her, after wishing her on her birthday. She genuinely refused his proposal. She moves to her room and looks in her photo gallery, where she sees the birthday celebration pictures when she had celebrated with her husband. The plot moves a few years before, where Manoja has been refused by her boyfriend Tarun. Her reason for rejecting the relationship is because she has not dated him close enough and his thoughts are primarily about sex. Later, he reveals that he is moving away from her and has a crush on Reshma. On the other side, Prabhu (Balakrishna Kola) lives with his parents. His parents were trying to get him married due to his lazy appearance, but he is rejected. Manoja's mother (Kalyani Natarajan), who is suffering from cancer, compels Manoja, and she agrees to get married. After Prabhu and Manoja get married, Prabhu tries to impress Manoja but fails. One day, Prabhu takes Manoja to a restaurant, where he meets Manoja's ex-boyfriend causing him to suspect Manoja as to whether she had a sexual relationship with her ex-boyfriend's, and he argues with Manoja. After he comes to know of Manoja's disciplined character, he apologizes. Manoja too apologizes, and both of them start dating as friends. After three years passed, when Prabhu and Manoja are about to celebrate their second wedding anniversary, Prabhu invites his friends to their celebration. His friends refuse to come and give him an idea to trick Manoja into bed with him. Prabhu tries this out and gets her drunk. He tries to seduce her when dancing, but when this fails and Manoja refuses, Prabhu forcibly rapes her. After the ordeal, Manoja attempts suicide by slashing her wrist multiple times. The now sober Prabhu admits her to a hospital. After the recovery, Manoja applies for a divorce, and they start living separately, but Prabhu is still in love with Manoja. Now the plot moves to present where four years have passed. Prabhu meets Manoja again. She calls Tarun again and requests him to propose to her. Tarun wants to have sex first, so he takes Manoja to Munnar. Prabhu and his Facebook friend Kamini (Parvathy Nair) also move to the same place where he tries to confess his love to Manoja. Manoja refuses to have sex with Tarun and gets thrown out. Prabhu tries to convince her of his love, to which Manoja replies that she too loves Prabhu but hates him because he raped her. Prabhu gives a knife to Manoja asking her to kill him, to which Manoja refuses. At last, Prabhu rips himself with the knife, hoping to satisfy Manoja. Manoja starts crying thinking Prabhu to be dead, but she hears his heartbeat and takes him to the hospital, where Prabhu then recovers. Manoja and Prabhu start living together happily. The film ends with a tagline \\"A true love is made up in heaven\\". In a post-credits scene, Manoja cooks food for Prabhu. Although the food tastes bad, Prabhu asks Manoja to bring some more. After Manoja moves to the kitchen, he laments to the audience as to how he can eat such bad food all his life.

The team shot scenes with Karthi, whose first film Paruthiveeran (2007) was awaiting release, and Sandhya. The film was stalled in early 2007 due to cinematographer Arvind Krishna's decision to leave White Elephants and the project was eventually shelved. Midway through the production of Aayirathil Oruvan, Selvaraghavan then relaunched Idhu Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam in November 2008 and filming started with a new cast of Dhanush and Andrea Jeremiah in the leading roles. Ramji and G. V. Prakash Kumar had taken over as the cinematographer and music director respectively. The film was described to be a \\"quick project\\" with Selvaraghavan and Dhanush's sister, Vimalageetha taking up the production reins. However, filming was subsequently stalled for unknown reasons in February 2009. In August 2009, the film was launched again for the third time with a first schedule planned in Hyderabad and Selvaraghavan taking over exclusively as producer. However the film was yet again abandoned in October 2009, and he began work on another project, Maruvan, with the lead actors instead. The film was relaunched in mid 2014 with Selvaraghavan's wife, Gitanjali, announced as the director of the script. Production began in August 2014 with newcomers Balakrishna Kola and Wamiqa Gabbi, while the film was announced to be produced by Balakrishna's father, editor Kola Bhaskar. Further newcomers Amrit and Sridhar were signed on as the film's music composer and cinematographer respectively.

Pinturikkyo's list. Borgia's apartments. 1492 ‚Äî 1495. Rome, Vatican palaces The history of arithmetic includes the period from the emergence of counting before the formal definition of numbers and arithmetic operations over them by means of a system of axioms. Arithmetic ‚Äî the science of numbers, their properties and their relations ‚Äî is one of the main mathematical sciences. It is closely connected with algebra and the theory of numbers. The practical need for counting, elementary measurements and calculations became the reason for the emergence of arithmetic. The first authentic data on arithmetic knowledge are found in the historical monuments of Babylon and Ancient Egypt in the third and second millennia BC. The big contribution to the development of arithmetic was made by the ancient Greek mathematicians, in particular Pythagoreans, who tried to define all regularities of the world in terms of numbers. In the Middle Ages trade and approximate calculations were the main scope of arithmetic. Arithmetic developed first of all in India and the countries of Islam and only then came to Western Europe. In the seventeenth century the needs of astronomy, mechanics, and more difficult commercial calculations put before arithmetic new challenges regarding methods of calculation and gave an impetus to further development. Theoretical justifications of the idea of number are connected first of all with the definition of \\"natural number\\" and Peano's axioms formulated in 1889. They were followed by strict definitions of rational, real, negative and complex numbers. Further expansion of the concept of number is possible only if one of the arithmetic laws is rejected.  The appearance of arithmetic  The Ishango bone, found near Lake Edward, possibly displaying a numbering system from more than 20,000 years ago. If in two sets of subjects each element of one set has only one corresponding element in the other set, these sets are one-to-one. Such actual comparison when subjects were displayed in two ranks, was used by primitive tribes in trade. This approach gives the opportunity to establish quantitative ratios between groups of objects and doesn't demand the concept of number. Further there were natural standards for counting, for example, fingers of hands, and then sets of standards, such as hands. The advent of the standards symbolizing concrete numbers also is connected to the emergence of the concept of number. Thus the number of things to be counted was compared to the Moon in the sky, the number of eyes, and the number of fingers on a hand. Later numerous standards were replaced with one of the most convenient, usually fingers of hands and/or feet.

Watercolor paper is paper or substrate onto which an artist applies watercolor paints, pigments or dyes. There are currently many types of paper available that are manufactured for the use with watercolors. Watercolor paper can be made of wood pulp exclusively, or mixed with cotton fibers. Pure cotton watercolor paper is also used by artists though it typically costs more than paper. It is also available as an acid-free medium to help its preservation. Watercolor paper can be described according to the manufacturing process. It can be hot pressed, cold pressed or rough. A number of companies sell watercolor papers, some of them with a long history of production. Papyrus was used as a 'paper' onto which the Egyptians applied their water-based paints or pigments. Arches began production of watercolor paper around 1620. It provided most of the paper used in France during the 1700s. In addition to watercolor paper, Arches also produced paper that was used in documents and paper that was used as currency during the revolution in France. Arches joined other paper manufacturers in the 1950s to form Arjomari Prioux. Woven paper was used in print publication in the late 1760s because it was found to be smoother. The watercolor paper at this time was used by artists because it allowed the application of paint without the unevenness of molded paper. James Whatman created a paper specifically for use with water colors by the 1780s. He used gelatin as a sizing that created a protective coating that reduced damage to the paper by repeated wetting, drying and reworking.
