Vietnam's Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) has estimated that there were 71,936 prostitutes in the country in 2013. Other estimates puts the number at up to 200,000. Sex workers organisations report that law enforcement is abusive and corrupt. MOLISA reported that in 2011, 750 prostitutes and 300 pimps were arrested. 251 businesses had their business licences revoked for involvement in the sex trade that year. Legal situation The \\"Ordinance on Prostitution Prevention and Combat\\" 2003 states: *Article 4: The following acts are strictly prohibited: **1. Buying sex; **2. Selling sex; **3. Harboring prostitution; **4. Organizing prostitution activities; **5. Forcing prostitution; **6. Brokering prostitution; **7. Protecting prostitution; **8. Abusing the service business for prostitution activities; **9. Other acts related to prostitution activities as prescribed by law. *Article 23.- Handling of prostitutes **1. Prostitutes shall, depending on the nature and seriousness of their violations, be administratively sanctioned, applied with the measure of education in communes, wards or townships or sent into medical treatment establishments. Foreign prostitutes shall, depending on the nature and seriousness of their violations, be administratively sanctioned in the forms of caution, fine and/or expulsion. **2. Prostitutes who, though being aware of their HIV infection, deliberately transmit thedisease to other persons shall be examined for penal liability. *Article 24.- Handling of persons committing prostitution-related acts **1. Those who protect prostitution, contribute capital for use for prostitution purposes shall, depending on the nature and seriousness of their violations, be administratively sanctioned or examined for penal liability. **2. Those who act as go-between for prostitution, harbor prostitution, coerce prostitution, organize prostitution, traffic in women and/or children in service of prostitution activities shall be examined for penal liability. Following complaints that Article 23.1 was in violation of the prostitute's rights, in June 2012 the \\"Law on Administrative Sanctions\\" ordered the release of all prostitutes and replaced \\"re-education\\" with fine between of the equivalent of $25 and $100. (About 1,300 prostitutes were in \\"rehabilitation‚Äô centres\\" in July 2011 being \\"treated and re-educated‚Äô). =Calls for decriminalization= A survey of 150 prostitutes by the Vietnamese government-run \\"Institute of Labor Science and Social Affairs\\" found that 44 percent of prostitutes had suffered violence at the hands of clients. Just under a half did not report the crimes to the authorities. The \\"Vietnam Network of Sex Workers\\" have called for decriminalization to make sex work safer. Kimberly Kay Hoang, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Chicago, who conducted a 2011 study of prostitutes in Ho Chi Minh City is quoted as saying: \\"Legalising prostitution would also reduce violence and sex crimes such as rape and sexual violence. Prostitutes would feel safe calling the police to report instances of violence and abuse by clients, traffickers, and pimps to law enforcement officials.\\" Mr. Le Duc Hien, deputy director of a government department tasked with fighting social evils under the labor ministry, crystallized this by telling the media: \\"It would be a strategic mistake to tap prostitution as an industry to boost tourism revenues. What would happen if we recognize sex work as a profession but fail to manage it later on?\\" Prostitution and the Vietnam War During the Vietnam War, a whole sex industry sprung up around American servicemen. It has been estimated that there were 300,000 prostitutes in the country during this period. Prostitutes congregated at bars frequented by GIs, and offered their services. Sometimes, the prostitutes got pregnant. The resulting Amerasian children, of whom there were estimated to be about 50,000, were ostracized and given the derisive name bui doi ('dust of life'). Often, these children were themselves forced into prostitution. During the war, hooch maids would often clean up after the soldiers in their dwellings. One soldier described the maids as being, \\"...good Catholics who might flirt with you but would never date an American soldier.\\" At the same time it was not unheard of for maids to \\"keep the plumbing clean\\" for soldiers in order to earn some extra income. HIV There is a problem of HIV among sex workers. Fear of detection prevents prostitutes accessing health services and so infections go untreated and spread. Advocates of decriminalization submit that where prostitution is illegal, sex workers are more susceptible to STIs. At a conference it 2011, a paper presented by Vietnam's Labor Ministry, said 9.3% of prostitutes in the country were infected by HIV. However it was considerably higher is some areas: Hanoi 20%, Ho Chi Minh City 16%, and Hai Phong 23%. Lack of access to condoms and medical services were primary causes. Prostitutes may also avoid condoms as they can be used as evidence of prostitution. A study of 5,298 prostitutes published in 2015 by \\"Drug Alcohol Depend\\" concluded that injected drug use is also a key risk factor for HIV transmission amongst prostitutes. Vietnamese prostitution in other nations Vietnamese prostitution is not confined to the country itself. In Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta, there are reports of women being forced into prostitution after marrying overseas, particularly in other Asian countries. In Macau, exploitation of women has been supported by legal organizations. In the end, these women were often forced into indentured servitude or prostitution. Many women travel from Lao Cai to Hekou County in China to work in brothels that cater to Chinese men. Child trafficking In Ho Chi Minh City, many of the prostitutes are under 18 years of age. Some forced into the trade because of economic needs. The prostitutes are both girls and boys (called Trai bao (\\"covered boy\\") and trai g·ªçi (\\"call boy\\")). In addition, children are trafficked due for the need for prostitution in other countries. One non-governmental organization estimates that the average age of trafficked girls is between 15 and 17, although the average age of girls trafficked to Cambodia is estimated to be much lower. In the Sa Pa tourist region, an Australian non-governmental organization uncovered 80 commercial cases of child exploitation by foreign nationals in 2007, the same year that the nation established a child sex tourism investigative unit within the Vietnam Ministry of Public Security.\\"Vietnam\\". Trafficking in Persons Report 2008. U.S. Department of State (June 4, 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Sex trafficking Vietnam is listed as a Tier 2 country for human trafficking by the US Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. Vietnam is a source and, to a lesser extent, a destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Vietnamese women and children are subjected to sex trafficking abroad; many are misled by fraudulent employment opportunities and sold to brothel operators on the borders of China, Cambodia, and Laos, and elsewhere in Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore. Some Vietnamese women who travel abroad for internationally brokered marriages or jobs in restaurants, massage parlors, and karaoke bars ‚Äî mostly to China, Malaysia, and Singapore ‚Äî are subjected to forced prostitution. False advertising, debt bondage, passport confiscation, and threats of deportation are tactics commonly used to compel Vietnamese victims into servitude. Traffickers increasingly use the internet, gaming sites, and particularly social media to lure potential victims into vulnerable situations; for example, men entice young women and girls with online dating relationships and persuade them to move abroad, then subject them to sex trafficking. Many children from impoverished rural areas, and a rising number from middle class and urban settings, are subjected to sex trafficking. Child sex tourists, reportedly from elsewhere in Asia, the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States, exploit children in Vietnam. Portrayal in media = The Tale of Kieu = The Tale of Ki·ªÅu is an 1820 poem describing the life of Th√∫y Ki·ªÅu, a young woman who sacrifices herself to save her family. To prevent the imprisonment of her brother and father, she sells herself into marriage, unaware that her new husband is actually a pimp, who forces her into prostitution. The poem is based on a Chinese story and was set in Ming China (1368-1644 AD). =Miss Saigon= The protagonist of the 1989 musical Miss Saigon is a Vietnamese prostitute named Kim. Echoing the plot of Puccini's opera Madama Butterfly, Kim falls in love with and is left pregnant by a client who is a white American soldier with a wife at home. After he has abandoned her for his American wife, Kim realizes her child's father will never return and shoots herself. The show drew criticism for promoting the stereotype of a dominant/submissive relationship between a Western man and an Asian prostitute. It might also have attracted criticism on other grounds, such as its lack of originality in repeating the basic theme of Madame Butterly, and the improbability of a sex worker's coming to love a man who pays for her services. =Fuck Miss Saigon= The 2017 book on the sex trade in Vietnam, written by a working prostitute from the Mekong Delta. This is the first account of prostitution in Vietnam by a prostitute. =Am Tinh= The 2008 Vietnamese television series Am Tinh is a documentary about Lam Uyen Nhi, a former beauty contest winner turned prostitute and drug addict. Eventually, Lam died in 2007 after a battle with HIV/AIDS. The 20-part series focuses on Lam's ups and downs, with 2006 Miss Vietnam winner Mai Phuong Thuy playing the part of Lam. =Full Metal Jacket= The 1987 film Full Metal Jacket features scenes wherein prostitution is depicted with the soldiers. In one scene, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) and Private Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard) are approached by a Da Nang hooker (Papillon Soo Soo). One of the scenes occurs during a lull between battles: :Da Nang Hooker: Well, baby, me so horny. Me so horny. Me love you long time. Me sucky sucky. :[later in the same dialog exchange] :Private Joker: What can I get for ten dollars? :Da Nang Hooker: Every t'ing you want. :Private Joker: Everything? :Da Nang Hooker: Every t'ing. = Hearts and Minds = The 1974 film Hearts and Minds features scenes of prostitution, at both the beginning of the film, and during the middle of it. The first scene depicts soldiers' soliciting prostitutes in Saigon, and the second scene includes interviews with soldiers who are with prostitutes, with questions asked about the war and their current activities. = Lost in Paradise = The 2011 film Lost in Paradise is a film that features two storylines; the main storyline focusing on gay male prostitution and the secondary storyline featuring a female prostitute. The film also includes violence against prostitutes for being gay. A Vancouver International Film Festival reviewer said that he felt the film's portrayal of gay prostitution was \\"authentic.\\"Tony Rayn, Lost in Paradise , Vancouver International Film Festival, Retrieved 26 Nov, 2011  See also  * Prostitutes in South Korea for the U.S. military References  External links  * Sex abuse and prostitution in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam ‚Äì short documentary video on YouTube * Candid Color Snapshots of Vietnamese Bar Girls During the Vietnam War Vietnamese society ","title":"Prostitution in Vietnam"},{"id":"16040766","text":"A timeline of the Holocaust in Norway is detailed in the events listed below. {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" |Date |Event |---- |17 May 1933 |Vidkun Quisling founds Nasjonal Samling |---- |7 February 1939 |Quisling gives speech on the \\"Jewish Danger\\"Abrahamsen (1991), p. 52 |---- |9 April 1940 |Operation Weser√ºbung: German forces invade and occupy Norway |---- |10 April 1940 |The Gestapo arrives in Haugesund, seeking to arrest Moritz Rabinowitz |---- |18 April 1940 |Hitler declares Norway a \\"hostile country\\" that can freely be exploitedAbrahamsen (1991), p. 63 |---- |24 April 1940 |Hitler names Josef Terboven as Reichskommissar with power to invoke and enforce decrees |---- |10 May 1940 |All radios in the possession of Jews are ordered confiscated |---- |25 September 1940 |Terboven speaks to the Norwegian people, promising tolerance of all religions |---- |4 December 1940 |Moritz Rabinowitz is arrested by the Gestapo |---- |16 January 1941 |Brawl breaks out in Bergen when Nazis try to prevent Ernst Glaser from performing |---- |1 March 1941 |Benjamin Bild is arrested in Kjeller |---- |21 April 1941 |The synagogue in Trondheim is seized and vandalized |---- |23 June 1941 |Decree bans Jews from practicing law |---- |23 June 1941 |Sixty Jewish prisoners are imprisoned at Grini |---- |10 October 1941 |All Jews in Norway are ordered to submit their identification papers to be stamped with the letter \\"J\\" |---- |26 December 1941 |Benjamin Bild dies at Gross-Rosen |---- |22 January 1942 |\\"Racial\\" definitions of Jewish identity are formalized in Norway |---- |28 January 1942 |Hellmuth Reinhard arrives in Norway, taking charge of the Gestapo |---- |1 February 1942 |Quisling claims that the Norwegian constitution's paragraph 2's last clause is back in force, banning Jews from Norway |---- |6 February 1942 |All Jews are ordered to complete questionnaire in triplicate |---- |27 February 1942 |Moritz Rabinowitz is beaten to death in Sachsenhausen |---- |7 March 1942 |Four Jewish Norwegians are executed at Falstad concentration camp on trumped-up charges |---- |21 August 1942 |Nine Jews arrested in N√¶rsnes, outside Oslo |---- |6 October 1942 |Martial law is declared in Trondheim;

The hymnal contains 501 Christian hymns representing a variety of musical styles. It was succeeded by Community of Christ Sings, which was released in October 2013. Harold Neal served as Chairman of the 1981 Hymnal Committee and production of the Hymns of the Saints was coordinated by Peter Judd of the Worship Office and Roger Revell of the Music Office. In the preface to the work, the committee acknowledges the influence of ‚Äúchanging theological concepts, the searching eye of historical research, shifting modes of expression, and increased sensitivity to the sanctity of personhood‚Äù in the preparation of the hymnal and the selection of hymns. Of the 501 hymns, 209 were not found in The Hymnal, which was published in 1956. The hymns are organized in four major sections: Praise and Thanksgiving (hymns 1‚Äì78); Contemplation and Renewal (hymns 79‚Äì185); God's Word for Us (186‚Äì368); and Commission and Commitment (hymns 369‚Äì501). In the hymnal, 127 lyrical contributions and 88 musical contributions were made by members of the denomination while the remainder are from earlier Latter Day Saint and Christian hymnists. Aside from six hymn texts drawn directly from the psalms (Hymns 15, 66, 110, 125, 258, and 461), the earliest Christian text is attributed to Aurelius Clemens Prudentius, who lived from 348 to 413; he is credited as the original author of the text from which Hymn 220, \\"Of the Father‚Äôs Love Begotten\\", was translated by John Mason Neale and Henry W.

In his first novel, British intelligence assigns Agent Jonathan Anders to investigate the death of their agents aboard a Russian trawler. Agent Jonathan Anders promptly finds himself entangled in an international misadventure‚Äîwith the Russians trying to exterminate him and the British police pursuing him for murder. He becomes involved in a contest against the Russian agents, survives an attempt on his life, and becomes aware of a Soviet plot to poison a lot of people. On the way to investigate the hold of a Russian trawler sunk near Guernsey, he meets Helen and Clark Bridges--who just happen to cruise by later when agents for the Russian survivors, suspecting Jon's mission, try to drown him. He discovers that Madam Cantelna, a Nobel Prize winning marine biologist, has a complete lab on board, and vials of some icky and revolting stuff which almost makes Helen vomit. In his cross- country pursuit of Madam Cantelna, Jon travels beyond Scotland (after a preposterous stopover with a pop singer who supplies a jet) to the island rendezvous where Madam would meet another trawler and finish her research on population poisoning by fish pollution.

The label, which is based in Amsterdam, was founded in 2000 and is dedicated to the release of electronic-based compositions, generally fitting into the field known as electronica. Because of certain similarities between electronica's compositional, production and editing styles, and aspects of the more mainstream Dance music genre, the two worlds sometimes overlap. It is not uncommon for certain artists to move between the two scenes - as with label boss, Tim Simenon. Simenon very occasionally releases his own compositions through the label, either under the alias of Bomb the Bass or as the more experimental Flow Creator. Opiate Sparks: Electric Tones Debuts Electric Tones 1234 EP (2000). The first Electric Tones release was a four-track compilation EP, entitled Electric Tones 1234 - with the name of the release reflecting how the collection included the first, second, third and fourth tracks released on the label. Issued in 2000, and taking the form of two 7-inch singles, the EP marked the recording debut of Opiate, aka Thomas Knak. Knak has since achieved a mainstream profile of sorts through his collaboration with Bj√∂rk, on her hugely successful Vespertine album - for which Knak co-wrote and produced several tracks. Also featured was a cut called Croissant by Club Off Chaos, which is an outfit led by Jaki Liebzeit, drummer with the band, Can. The EP was rounded off with the notable inclusion of several tracks by a hitherto unknown act, called Flow Creator. Upon reading the credits closely, this turned out to be another alter-ego for Tim Simenon. Regular Current: Compilations & New Names Up until the end of 2007, Electric Tones had released two further EPs, more often than not collecting brand new acts together: Electric Tones 5678 and Electric Tones 9101112, both of which were issued in the 12-inch single format. Each release was limited to a run of 500 copies each, with the record sleeve - as is the case with limited edition releases - stamped with the individual copy number. In a press release from the period, Simenon was quoted as saying of the limited number release approach, \\"All the releases were limited editions to keep the hobby spirit alive.\\" Electric Tones 5678 is divided equally between Opiate, and Amsterdam- based musician, Ricardo Avocado - included together here, perhaps, because both acts were experimenting with aspects of Dub aesthetics. Electric Tones 9101112 features two tracks by Soul Circuit, which turned out to be an occasional alias for Adrian Corker and Paul Conboy, otherwise known as A.P.E.. The remaining pair of compositions making up this EP included, an abstract contribution from Noriko, the recording name of Newcastle DJ, James Postlethwaite. And, playing the collection out was the reappearance of the Bomb The Bass name - for the first time in 9 years - courtesy of a Christian Kleine remix of Clear Cut featuring Lali Puna (the latter of which has since become a much sought after rarity). All of these EP tracks would later be rounded up, and released in digital CD form under the collective title, Jukebox; in turn becoming the labels seventh release. Alternate Current: Non-compilation Releases Slowfall EP by Wiseintime (2001). As of 2008, in between its compilation work, Electric Tones has also released five records by five individual artists. First out was Blind by A.P.E. Issued on a 7-inch single, Blind is a futuristic blues song. Next came a 10-inch single built around two tracks, Slowfall and Meltdown, by an artist listed as Wiseintime. Again this release shone across another pseudonym by an already well-known name, with Wiseintime an alternative representation of Ian Simmonds, aka Juryman. Ricardo Avacado also scored his recording debut through Electric Tones, with his 2002 release, The Bridge Ends EP. Limited to a numbered run of 300 copies, the 10-inch single ran at 33-rpm, with side-A dedicated to Checkpoint Fender, and Left of Legzira filling the flipside. Avacado's work continued to mine the possibilities of melding contemporary Electronica with the Dub aesthetic, illustrating a clear progression of his compositional manifesto from Electric Tones 5678. The ninth release from the label would come courtesy of producer/programmer, Jono Podmore, otherwise known as Kumo. Kumo And Friends would feature three tracks, and spotlight the progressive compositional talents of the one-time child violinist and electronic music student, who at one time or another had previously worked with the likes of The Shamen, Robert Owens, Ian McCulloch and BJ Cole. Surge: New Electric Tones Material In February 2008, came the announcement that Tim Simenon was reinstating Bomb The Bass to active mainstream duties, with the intended release of a new album, Future Chaos. With full release details still to come, and following his lengthy absence from the mainstream, Simenon continues to ramp up communication through the bands Myspace platform. However, it has still not been confirmed as to whether Future Chaos will be an Electric Tones release (no doubt becoming e-tones 010) supported by some kind of outside distribution deal. As of March 2008, the track Butterfingers was featured along with a promotional video on the Bomb The Bass Myspace page - suggesting that the song will be a single release ahead of Future Chaos.

MMPs belong to a family of zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases. These enzymes have the ability to break down connective tissue. The expression of MMPs is increased in various pathological conditions like inflammatory conditions, metabolic bone disease, to cancer invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Examples of diseases are periodontitis, hepatitis, glomerulonephritis, atherosclerosis, emphysema, asthma, autoimmune disorders of skin and dermal photoaging, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, chronic ulcerations, uterine involution, corneal epithelial defects, bone resorption and tumor progression and metastasis. Due to the role of MMPs in pathological conditions, inhibitors of MMPs may have therapeutic potential. Several other proteins have similar inhibitory effects, however none as effective (netrins, procollagen C-terminal proteinase enhancer (PCPE), reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI-2)). They might have other biological activities which have yet been fully characterised. MMP inhibitors can broadly be subdivided into non-synthetic (e.g. endogenous) or synthetic. Several potent MMP inhibitors have been identified, including hydroxymates, thiols, carbamoylphosphonates, hydroxyureas, hydrazines, Œ≤-lactams, squaric acids and nitrogenous ligands. There are three classes of commonly used inhibitors for metalloproteinases. * In vitro, EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline and other chelating compounds lower the concentration of metal to the point where the metal is removed from the enzyme active site. * Classical lock and key inhibitors such as phosphoramidon and bestatin bind tightly by approximating the transition state of the hydrolysis of the peptide, preventing it from acting on other substrates. * Protein inhibitors such as Œ±2-macroglobulin are known to work with metalloproteinases. History The first generation of MMP inhibitors were based on the structure of the collagen molecule. This group of inhibitors contain a hydroxamate (-CONHOH) group that binds the zinc atom in the active site of the MMP enzyme. The first MMP inhibitors that were tested in patients were Ilomastat and Batimastat, hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors. However, neither compound showed good oral bioavailability. Thus far, Periostat (active ingredient is doxycycline hyclate) is the only MMP inhibitor that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is used for the treatment of periodontitis. Other MMP inhibitors have exhibited serious side effects during preclinical trials. These side effects are caused by insufficient selectivity. Most MMP inhibitors are unable to target specific MMPs connected to specific pathological conditions. Instead, they inhibit multiple MMPs, some of which have protective functions or are not related to pathology. MMPs have been regarded as promising targets for cancer therapy. Preclinical studies investigating the efficacy of MMP suppression in tumor models were encouraging. Following these results, clinical studies were conducted but turned out to be disappointing. Recent studies have shown that MMPs may even have paradoxical roles in tumor progression. MMPs seem to have tumor-promoting effects as well as tumor suppressive effects dependent on different contexts. Mechanism of action Inactivation of MMP by endogenous and pharmacological MMP inhibitors Most MMP inhibitors are chelating agents. The inhibitor binds to the zinc at the active center of the enzyme, thereby blocking its activity. Other inhibitor mechanisms are possible. Œ±2-Macroglobulin (Œ±2M) is a protease inhibitor which inhibits activated MMPs. Œ±2M and MMP form a complex which is able to inactivate the MMP. MMPs are associated with the cell surface or bound to the extracellular matrix which prevents them from diffusing away and keeps the MMP under control of the cell. One mechanism to inhibit MMP activity is by dislodging the enzymes from their receptors. Gold salts bind to a heavy metal site distinct form the zinc- containing active center, which inhibits their activity. MMP activity can be decreased by binding to the cleavage site on the substrate e.g. catechin. Two molecular features of most MMP inhibitors are responsible for the affinity. One is a chelating moiety that interacts with the zinc ion and the other is a hydrophobic extension from the catalytic site that project into S1‚Äô pocket (P1‚Äô group) of the metalloproteinase. The structural difference MMPs‚Äô is mainly in the S1‚Äô side and by modifying the P1‚Äô group, inhibitor selectivity can be developed. Drug development Various potential MMP inhibitors will be explained in the following sections, including information on their development, structure-activity relationship and pharmacokinetics. =Pioneering hydroxamate structures= The first generation of MMP inhibitors were based on the structure of the collagen molecule. In the design of these inhibitors, the basic protein backbone of collagen is maintained but the amide bond is replaced with a zinc-binding group. This group of inhibitors contain a hydroxamate (-CONHOH) group that binds the zinc atom in the active site of the MMP enzyme, therefore this group is called \\"hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors‚Äú. An example can be seen in Marimastat, a first generation inhibitor, which has a similar backbone and sidechain format to collagen. Marimastat compared to collagen Ilomastat and batimastat were the first two MMP inhibitors to be tested in patients. These are both hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors and have similar overall structures. 360x360px The hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors display an excellent anticancer activity in tumor cells but the clinical performances of these compounds were disappointing. A factor contributing to this disappointment was that they are broad-spectrum inhibitors of many MMP sub-types that can in many cases also inhibit members of the ADAMs protease family. When they were tested in patients they induced dose-limiting muscular and skeletal pain in a number of the patients. Only when the structures of the MMP inhibitors could be adjusted to impart selectivity and abolish toxicity, would they achieve clinical impact in cancer chemotherapy. New generation hydroxamate-based inhibitors The pioneering hydroxamate-based inhibitors were followed by a set of 'new generation' molecules with features including a substituted aryl, a sulfonamide and a hydroxamate zinc-binding group. New generation hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors In MMI-270 there is also an amino acid sidechain-type substituent on the carbon that is Œ± to the hydroxamate, along with a sidechain on the sulfonamide (which was later shown to be unnecessary). The N-arylsulfonyl-Œ±-aminoacid hydroxamate of MMI-270 mimics the marimastat succinate motif. Cipemastat, which was developed as an MMP-1, -3 and -9 collagenase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid- and osteo- arthritis, also has the marimastat succinate motif. Its clinical trial was terminated prematurely. MMI-166 has an N-arylsulfonyl-Œ±-aminocarboxylate zinc-binding group, different from the hydroxamate-zinc binding group seen in MMI-270 and Cipemastat. It also has a triaryl substitution that the other structures didn‚Äòt have. ABT-770 and Prinomastat also have an aryl substitution. In ABT-770 the two phenyl rings are directly connected but in Prinomastat the two phenyl rings are connected by an oxygen atom, forming a diphenylether. These three permutations direct the SAR away from MMP-1 and toward the ‚Äûdeep pocket‚Äú MMPs such as the gelatinases. ABT-770 shows anticancer activity in animal models, but it is easily metabolised to an amine metabolite that causes phospholipidosis. MMI-166 has shown anticancer activity in numerous animal models, but there is no data available of its clinical performance. Prinomastat on the other hand, is one of the best studied MMP inhibitors. It showed excellent preclinical animal anticancer efficacy, but a recurring limitation to these hydroxamates (Prinomastat in particular) is drug metabolism including loss of the hydroxamate zinc-binding group. Subsequent new generation hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitors These inhibitors were followed by the next group of hydroxamate-based inhibitors, which focus on the suppression of metabolism, minimization of MMP-1 inhibitory activity and the control of subtype selectivity, by structure-based design. The tetrahydropyran in RS-130830 introduces a steric block that suppresses metabolism, which would fix the problem that the previous generation of inhibitors showed. The outcome of its clinical evaluation has not yet been disclosed. 239796-97-5 has improved ADME and MMP-1 selectivity properties and has shown excellent oral efficacy in an animal model of osteoarthritis. Although, the therapeutic objectives for these inhibitors is not cancer, like it has been for most of the MMP inhibitors. =New generation thiol-based inhibitors= Rebimastat Rebimastat is a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor with a thiol zinc-binding group. It has oral bioavailability and is a collagen non-peptide mimetic. Rebimastat has some selectivity as it doesn't inhibit all the MMPs operations. The metalloproteinases that release TNF-alpha, TNF-II, L-selectin, IL-1-RII and IL-6 are for example not inhibited by Rebimastat. In phase I of clinical trials, there was no sign of dose-dependent joint toxicity and a disease stabilization. Arthralgia was noted in phase II early breast cancer trials, which was connected to MMP inhibitor toxicity. Rebimastat was used in a Paclitaxel/Carboplatin treatment in phase III. The results of the trial was a higher incidence of adverse reactions, without survival benefit. Tanomastat Clinical trials for Tanomastat, an alfa-((phenylthio)methyl)carboxylate, showed similar results. It showed good disease stability and tolerance in Phase I solid tumor trials and good tolerance in advanced cancer in combination with Etoposide. However, its efficacy was not proven to be adequate. Tanomastat showed significant hepatotoxicity in a cancer therapy combined with Cisplatin and Etoposide, although in a treatment with Doxorubicin it showed good tolerance and lowered toxicity with 5-fluorouracil and Leucovorin. Many compounds in the thiol zinc-binding groups have good water solubility and are air stable in plasma and these groups will be continued in MMP inhibitor designing. =Pyrimidine-based inhibitors= Ro 28-2653 Ro 28-2653 is highly selective for MMP-2, MMP-9 and membrane type 1 (MT-1)-MMP. It is an antitumor and antiangiogenic agent with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of TACE and MMP-1 are linked to the musculoskeletal side effects seen in hydroxamate metalloproteinase inhibitors, but this compound spares the enzymes. It has been shown to diminish tumor growth in nasal cancer in rats as well as prostate cancer cell cultures. The compound only has moderate effect on mice's adipose tissue and no alteration on joints. Based on this, it is concluded that class of inhibitors is less likely to trigger neuromuscular adverse effects. On the active site of the structure is a pyrimidinetrione chelation and the phenyl and piperidynil section occupy the S1‚Äô and S2‚Äô binding pockets of MMP-8. Compound 556052-30-3 is similar to Ro 28-2653 but incorporates a 4-((2-methylquinolin-4-yl)methoxy)phenyl sidechain that is TACE selective. 5-(spiropyrrolidin-5-yl)pyrimidinetrione is a compound named 848773-43-3 that is a potent MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 inhibitor that spares MMP-1 and TACE. By substituting 1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl heteroaryl at C-4‚Äô of the diphenylether segment to accomplish MMP-13 selectivity over MT-1 MMP, made the compound 420121-84-2. The compound has IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 1 nM for MMP-13. I125-radioable pyrimidinetriones that have similar structure have been made to be used in MMP-9 elevated atherosclerosis and elevated MMP-2 and MMP-9 cancers. This class of MMP inhibitors is easy to synthesize and are potent enough for clinical valuation. Compound 544678-85-5 Pyrimidine dicarboxamideCompound 544678-85 is the latest pyrimidine based inhibitor, the compound is a pyrimidine-4,6-dicarboxamide that is very potent and MMP-13 selective. The compound has a specificity loop that within the S1‚Äô pocket and its 3-methyl-4-fluoro group is proximal enough to the zinc to change the water entity. These compounds have good oral bioavailability and properties that promote them to be a good candidate for a subtype inhibitor of MMP-13 based diseases and future development. Pyrimidine dicarboxamides are highly selective MMP-13 inhibitors. In the S1‚Äô pocket of MMP-13 is an S1‚Äô side pocket that is unique to the matrix metalloproteiase. Pyrimidine dicarboxamides bind to this side pocket, which increases the selectivity. The role of MMP-13 is cleaving fibrillar collagen at neutral pH and higher mRNA levels of MMP-13 is detected in breast carcinoma and osteoarthritis joints. The pyrimidine dicarboxamide inhibitor example in the image does not interact with the catalytic zinc ion but rather binds to the S1‚Äô side pocket. One pyridyl arm is situated to the entrance of the S1‚Äô pocket while the other pyridyl arm goes through the S1‚Äô pocket into the side pocket. =Hydroxypyrone-based inhibitors= Compound 868368-30-3 Potent and selective MMP-3 inhibitors have been developed by using a hydroxypyrone as the zinc binding group. By attaching an aryl backbone to the 2-position of the pyrone ring, more selectivity was gained. On the hydroxypyrone ring, three positions are available to attach backbones, position 2-, 5- and 6-. Hydroxypyrone-based MMP inhibitors are structurally corresponding to the pyrimidinetriones. A recent inhibitor is the compound 3-hydroxypyran-4-one nominated 868368-30-3. It is MMP-3 selective and its 0,0-bidentate chelation of zinc is the structural part proposed to be responsible for the MMP recognition. =Phosphorus-based inhibitors= Example of a phosphinic MMP inhibitor CAS Reg. No. 582311-81-7 Investigation on MMP inhibitors with phosphorus based zinc binding groups focused on Œ±-biphenylsulfonylamino phosphonates. These inhibitors bind through two phosphonate oxygen atoms. Phosphonate inhibitors have been developed that exhibit selectivity for MMP-8 over other MMPs. Selective MMP-8 inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of acute liver disease and multiple sclerosis Phosphinic MMP inhibitors have been reported to target MMP-11 and MMP-13. MMP-13 plays a role in cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis. These phosphinate MMP inhibitors contain phenyl segments that are thought to be responsible for the selectivity to MMP-13. The phosphinic group of those inhibitors (R1R2 (O)OH) binds as a zinc ligand. R1 and R2 substituents affect the inhibition potency. Phosphinate inhibitors have been developed that showed high selectivity for MMP-11. Derivatives based on phenyl rings showed the best selectivity. MMP-11 could be a useful target for tumorgenesis in breast cancer. 156x156px Phosphorus-based inhibitors with carbamoyl phosphonate zinc binding groups do not bind through two oxygen of the phosphonate. Carbamoyl phosphonate zinc binding groups binds Zn2+ through the oxygen of the phosphonate and the oxygen of the alpha carbonyl to the phosphonate. This binding forms a 5-members chelate ring that looks similar to the binding of hydroxamic acid. The amide bond of the carbamoyl phosphonate provide a hydrogen bond donor for protein interactions and the amide group has an electron donating ability that provides strong Zn2+ chelation. The carbamoyl phosphonate zinc binding groups have a net negative charge that hinders cell penetration of these inhibitors and restricts them to the extracellular space. This cell penetration prevention contributes to the low toxicity of these inhibitors. Inhibitors with a carbamoyl phosphonate zinc-binding group are selective for MMP-2. MMP-2 could be a useful target for tumor invasion and angiogenesis. A carbamoyl phosphonate inhibitor has been developed that affects MMP-2 and MMP-9 sparing other MMPs. This compound showed inhibitory activity on cell invasion and tumor colonization. In in vivo studies, this inhibitor showed efficacy with oral dosing and administration into the abdominal cavity (intraperitoneal). It shows slow absorption, rapid elimination and low oral bioavailability. Prolonged absorption contributes to sustained efficacy. Inhibitors with carbamoyl phosphonate zinc binding groups are water-soluble at physiological pH. =Tetracycline-based inhibitors= Basic structure of a tetracycline chelating a metal (M)Tetracyclines are antibiotics that also exhibit MMP inhibitory activity. They chelate Zn2+ ion, thereby inhibiting MMP activity. It is believed that tetracyclines also effect MMP expression and proteolytic activity. Doxycycline Doxycycline is a semi-synthetic tetracycline that has been studied for dental and medical applications. Its effects on diseases like periodontitis and cancer has been investigated. Doxycycline is nearly completely absorbed with a bioavailability about 95% in average and a 20% reduction with co-administration of food. Its volume of distribution is 50‚Äì80 L (0,7 L/kg). Protein binding is 82‚Äì93 %. It is excreted in urine and in feces. Doxycycline is available in oral and intravenous form. Doxycycline exhibited inhibitory activity on MMP-2 and MMP-9. The expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 are often elevated in human cancer. The increased expression and activity correlates with advanced tumor stage, increased metastasis and prognosis. Chemically modified tetracyclines (CMT) have been developed to explore their inhibitory potential. Most studies in tetracyclines and CMTs showed that they can inhibit MMP activity. Chemically modified tetracycline COL-3, Metastat One CMT called COL-3 or metastat has been demonstrated to be a potent MMP inhibitor. COL-3 features a tetracycline scaffold that is unsubstituted on positions C4‚ÄìC9. Advantages of CMT over conventional tetracyclines are that chronic use does not result in gastrointestinal toxicity and higher plasma levels can be achieved for extended time span reducing administration frequency. The pharmacokinetics of COL-3 has been studied in rats. COL-3 is absorbed slowly from the gastrointestinal tract. 3% are excreted through the urinary tract while 55‚Äì66% is excreted in feces. The drug is highly lipophilic and able to cross the blood brain barrier at higher doses. COL-3 accumulates in higher concentration in heart tissue and testis. In clinical trials plasma protein binding has been shown to be high (~94,5%). Most COL-3 binds to serum albumin. =Endogenous inhibitors= MMP activity is regulated at various levels for example by endogenous inhibitors like Œ±2-macroglobulin and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Œ±2-macroglobulin regulates a broad spectrum of proteases, while TIMPs are more specific endogenous MMP inhibitors. Œ±2-macroglobulin is an abundant plasma protein that acts in tissue fluids. The plasma glycoprotein consists of four subunits. Œ±2-macroglobulin does not inhibit the activation of MMPs or the MMPs themselves. It entraps proteinases like MMPs and forms a complex with them. The complex is endocytosed and cleared by a low-density lipoprotein-receptor- related protein. In humans, 4 different TIMPs have been found. They are secreted proteins of low-molecular weight. TIMPs bind noncovalently to the active site of MMPs. Changes of TIMP levels are considered to play a role in pathological conditions associated with unbalanced MMP activities. TIMPs consist of 184-194 amino acids. These inhibitors are subdivided into two domains N-terminal and C-terminal. The N-terminal regions of the four TIMPs share a common structure. They all contain twelve cysteine residues that form six disulfide bonds. These bonds are critical for the conformation of the N-terminal and its MMP- inhibitory activities. The C-terminals of the TIMPs differ from each other. The N-terminal subunit is capable of inhibiting MMPs. The TIMP molecule form fits into the active site of an MMP. The TIMP contact the catalytic cleft of the MMP in a similarly as a substrate. TIMPs inhibit all MMPs except TIMP-1 which does not inhibit MT-1-MMP. There are some differences in the inhibitory preferences of TIMPs. TIMP-1 for example favors to inhibit MMP-9. Other examples are TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 which are more potent MMP-2 inhibitors than MMP-9 inhibitors. TIMPs could potentially be useful against illnesses like cardiovascular disease and cancer. The application of TIMPs as therapeutic instrument through gene therapy or direct protein application is still in early stages of development. It is preferable to inhibit specific MPPs that play a role in pathological conditions. Since TIMPs inhibit multiple MMPs it is desirable to develop engineered TIMPs with altered specificity. Current status The primary goal of MMP inhibitor design is selectivity. The targeting of specific MMPs is expected to improve efficacy and prevent side effects like musculoskeletal syndrome (MSS). 3D structures of MMP inhibitors provide a source of insight of the structural relationships for selectivity. High throughput screening can as well increase the chances of discovering inhibitors with high selectivity.

UNAIDS estimate there are 54,000 prostitutes in the country. Many of these women have turned to prostitution because of poverty. Many are Somali refugees. The punishment for prostitution is three years imprisonment. Much prostitution takes place in hotels in Sana‚Äôa. Some hotels have \\"house prostitutes\\" and it is possible to book a room and a woman to be ready on arrival. Many sex tourists from other Gulf states, particularly Saudis and Emiratis, indulge in what are known as \\"tourist marriages\\". These are authorised by some Islamic authorities as ‚Äúmisyar‚Äù marriages. Sex trafficking and child prostitution are problems in the country. Islamic activism In 2009, the Yemeni religious police led a crackdown against Chinese-organised prostitution in Sana'a. The workers at many massage parlors, spas and restaurants were dragged out into the streets, and the establishments were closed down. It was alleged that corruption had allowed the establishments to operate up to that time. The police were pressured into action by the \\"Virtue and Vice Committee\\" which was led by cleric Abdul Majeed al-Zindani. Zindani, who was designated as a terrorist by the United States in 2004, had previously issued a fatwa sanctioning the demolition of the house of a man suspected of running a prostitution ring. In January 2012, armed Islamists attacked a hotel in Aden which they suspected of being used for prostitution. More than 10 gunmen opened fire on the Layali Dubai (Dubai Nights) hotel before setting fire to it. 2 people were killed and 13 injured. Sex trafficking Yemen is a country of origin and, to a lesser extent, transit and destination, for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. The ongoing conflict, lack of rule of law, and the deteriorating economy have likely disrupted some trafficking patterns and exacerbated others. Traffickers, security officials, and employers forced some Yemeni children into sex trafficking in Saudi Arabia. Prior to the conflict, Yemen was a transit point and destination for women and children, primarily from the Horn of Africa, who were subjected to sex trafficking. Ethiopians and Somalis travelled voluntarily to Yemen with the hope of employment in Gulf countries, but some women and children among this population may have been exploited in sex trafficking in Yemen. Others migrated based on fraudulent offers of employment as domestic workers in Yemen, where they were subsequently subjected to sex trafficking. Some female refugees were previously forced into prostitution in Aden and Lahij Governorates. The UN estimated that the protracted Syrian conflict resulted in an influx of as many as 100,000 Syrian refugees to Yemen; Syrian refugee women and children begging in the streets were highly vulnerable to sex trafficking in the country. Yemeni children have been subjected to sex trafficking within the country and in Saudi Arabia. Girls as young as 15 years old have reportedly been exploited in commercial sex in hotels and clubs in the Governorates of Sana‚Äôa, Aden, and Taiz. Prior to the conflict, most child sex tourists in Yemen were from Saudi Arabia, with a smaller percentage originating from other Gulf nations, including the United Arab Emirates. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Yemen as a 'Special case' country.

On 9 January 1947 the main architectural features of the temples were destroyed by the U.S. Army as part of denazification. The first memorial On 8 November 1933 Hitler addressed the party‚Äôs old guard at the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller (where the putsch had begun) and the next day unveiled a small memorial with a plaque underneath at the east side of the Feldherrnhalle. Two policemen or the SS stood guard on either side of the memorial‚Äôs base and passers-by were required to give the Hitler salute. The memorial could be circumvented, and the salute avoided, by choosing a small nearby side street, which came to be known as Dr√ºckebergergasse (\\"Shirker's Alley\\"). The inauguration In 1934 no commemorative march was made on the anniversary because of Hitler‚Äôs purge of the SA‚Äôs ranks in the Night of the Long Knives. The next year on 8 November the putschists were exhumed from their graves and taken to the Feldherrnhalle, where they were placed beneath sixteen large pylons bearing their names. The next day, after Hitler had solemnly walked past from one to the next, they were taken down the monument‚Äôs steps and taken on carts, draped in flags to Paul Ludwig Troost‚Äôs new Ehrentempel monuments at the K√∂nigsplatz, through streets lined with spectators bustling between 400 columns with eternal flames atop. Flags were lowered as veterans slowly placed the heavy sarcophagi into place. In each of the structures eight of the martyrs were interred in a sarcophagus bearing their name. The martyrs of the movement were in heavy black sarcophagi in such a way as to be exposed to rain and sun from the open roof. When Gauleiter Adolf Wagner died from a stroke in 1944 he was interred metres away from the north temple in the adjacent grass mound in between the two temples. Features At the temples visitors were required to be silent, not wear hats and keep children from running over the centre of the temples. The Ehrentempel was made of limestone except for its roof which was made of steel and concrete with etched glass mosaics. The pedestals of the temples, which are the only parts remaining, are . The columns of the structures each extended . The combined weight of the sarcophagi was over . Post-war On 5 July 1945 the American occupying army removed the bodies from the Ehrentempel and contacted their families. They were given the option of having their loved ones buried in Munich cemeteries in unmarked graves or their family plots or having them cremated, common practice in Germany for unclaimed bodies. The columns of the structures were recycled into brake shoes for municipal buses and new material for art galleries damaged in the war. The sarcophagi were melted down and given to the Munich tram service who used it for soldering material to repair rail and electrical lines damaged by the war. On 9 January 1947 the upper parts of the structures were blown up. The centre portion was subsequently partially filled in but often filled with rain water which created a natural memorial. When Germany was reunited there were plans made for a biergarten, restaurant or caf√© on the site of the Ehrentempel but these were derailed by the growth of rare biotope vegetation on the site. As a result of this, the temples were spared complete destruction and the foundation bases of the monuments remain, intersecting on the corner of Briennerstrasse and Arcisstrasse. In the intermittent period of the 1947 destruction and 1990 handover, basements (hitherto unknown to the Americans) were uncovered beneath the structures. A small plaque added in 2007 explains their function.

Education Vincent Giarrano was born on 17 November 1960 in Buffalo, New York. He took an early interest in drawing and by the time he was 12, the choice had been made. He went on to complete his BFA from The State University of New York in 1982 and an MFA from Syracuse University in 1985. Subsequently, he pursued a career in Marvel Comics and DC Comics among others as an illustrator. He credits his years‚Äô of experience of drawing comic books to developing a sense of the narrative structure.  Work  Around 2000, Vincent again started to take an active interest in Fine Arts, particularly in realist painting. He meticulously studied the works of John Singer Sargent, attended workshops and painted with friends. From the middle of the decade his works started to appear in Group and Solo Exhibitions fairly frequently. His works have been exhibited in National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC and National Portrait Gallery, London. Vincent loves painting the ubiquitous experiences from everyday lives. To him, these fleeting moments can carry something of infinite significance. It is also of extreme importance for him to effectively capture the light and create a moody atmosphere.  Influence  Besides John Singer Sargent, other painters like Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, Anders Zorn and Edward Hopper impress him deeply. The enormous courage and sincere commitment of the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh move him to the core.

It lies about north-west of Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec. It stands at the middle of a lake on a rocky island. Its picturesque Renaissance building is a destination of thousands of tourists every year. Its name ƒåerven√° Lhota meaning \\"red lhota\\" can be explained by the colour of the ch√¢teau's bright-red roof tiles.Neal Bedford, Jane Rawson, Matt Warren, Czech & Slovak Republics, pg. 245, Lonely Planet Publications (2004), There is also a park, where the Chapel of the Holy Trinity () is located. History ƒåerven√° Lhota The existence of an original fortress on the site of today's ch√¢teau is assumed from sometime around the middle of the 14th century. It was built on a rocky granite outcrop, which, after the damming of a stream and the filling up of a fishpond, became an island. The first written source is an entry into the land records from 1465, mentioning the division of the property of deceased Ctibor of Z√°smuk between his two sons Petr and V√°clav. The fortress then might have been sold into the ownership of Divi≈° Boub√≠nsk√Ω of √öjezd, who sold it to the knightly family of K√°b of Ryb≈àan sometime around 1530. The family had the original Gothic castle rebuilt and the basic Renaissance remodelling carried out between 1542-1555, and the ch√¢teau acquired the name Nov√° Lhota.Toma≈° Ehrenberger, The 88 Most Beautiful Castles, pg. 33-34, Kartografie Praha a.s., In 1597, the ch√¢teau was sold to Vil√©m R≈Øt of D√≠rn√° who had the building rendered with red plaster, from which it got its name ƒåerven√° Lhota. The last of the Ruts, Bohuslav, had to leave the Bohemian lands as an Utraquist after the 1620 Battle of White Mountain. In 1621, ƒåerven√° Lhota was inhabited by Antonio Bruccio, who died in 1639 without an heir. With his death, Lhota lost its function as a residence and it was used by his successors as occasional cottage. In 1641, it was acquired by aristocrat Vil√©m Slavat of Chlum and Ko≈°umberk and later it passed into the hands of the Windisch-Graetz family. Bed≈ôich Arno≈°t Windisch-Graetz and his son Leopold dragged the dominion into great debts due to their out-dated style of economics, so the custodian of his under-aged successor Joseph Nicholas recommended the sale of the dominion. In 1755 the ch√¢teau then was obtained by the Barons of Gudenus. Franz de Paul, Baron of Gudenus, shortly afterwards initiated several constructions, which were brought to an abrupt halt in 1774 by a great fire, which destroyed essentially all agricultural buildings. In 1776, ƒåerven√° Lhota welcomed a new owner, Baron Ign√°c Stillfried, a progressive aristocrat of Prussian Silesia, who from 1796 accommodated the composer Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf at the castle. His son sold the dominion to Jakub Veith in 1820. His daughter Terezie sold the ch√¢teau again in 1835, this time into the princely hands of Heinrich Eduard von Sch√∂nburg-Hartenstein who gave the castle to his son Josef Alexander von Sch√∂nburg-Hartenstein. He died in 1937 and was buried into the newly built tomb, and thus spared the destructive events of the new war, which drew the curtains closed for the entire aristocratic history of ƒåerven√° Lhota ch√¢teau. After the confiscation of the ch√¢teau by the Czechoslovak state in 1946, a children's clinic was established here. However, a year later, the ch√¢teau was granted to a National Culture Commission, and in 1949 it was opened to the public. Description ƒåerven√° Lhota The four-winged two-storey ch√¢teau, with a small courtyard in the center, occupies the whole rock and juts into the fishpond. A stone bridge, built in 1622, links the ch√¢teau with the banks of the pond, replacing the original drawbridge.Petr David, Vladim√≠r Soukup, Lubom√≠r ƒåech, Wonders of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, pg. 145, Euromedia Group (2004), The interiors have an extensive collection of historic furniture, tiled stoves, pictures, porcelain and other items. The southern edge of the fishpond is covered in thick forest, which forms a backdrop to the ch√¢teau. On the northern side is a landscaped park where the Renaissance Chapel of the Holy Trinity is situated. A marked circular path trenches around the fishpond. Rowing across the fishpond is a pleasant diversion on a hot summer day, and boats can be hired near the ch√¢teau.

The story was the winner of the 1989 Hugo Award for Best Short Story and the 1989 SF Chronicle Award. It was also nominated for the 1989 Nebula Award for Best Novelette as well as the 1989 Locus award.The LOCUS Index to SF Awards Plot summary The story is set on Kirinyaga, an artificial orbital colony that recreates an African savannah environment. The protagonist is Koriba, the mundumugu (priest or shaman) of a Kikuyu tribe living there. Koriba was raised in the mainstream modern world and has several graduate degrees, but came to resent bitterly how \\"Western\\" ways displaced African traditions. Later, he led a group of Kikuyu colonists to Kirinyaga to recreate a traditional Kikuyu society. A generation later, the residents live as their pre-modern ancestors did, as illiterate subsistence farmers and herders, with no access to or even knowledge of the larger world. They follow Kikuyu traditions in everything, guided by Koriba, who is one of the last survivors of the founding group. Koriba has a hidden computer terminal and conducts all contact with Maintenance, the agency which operates the machinery that provides Kirinyaga's artificial environment and keeps its orbit stable. Kikuyu tradition says that a child born feet first is a demon. Koriba kills such a child, causing a breach with Maintenance. Maintenance sends an investigator to see if they need to interfere with and regulate the Kikuyu traditions. Koriba is unbending in his insistence that Maintenance not interfere with Kikuyu traditions no matter how much they dislike them. In the end Maintenance informs Koriba that they will not tolerate the killing of infants. Koriba begins to train the young men of the tribe as warriors, in preparation for armed resistance to Maintenance.  Creation  Kirinyaga was written as a submission for a planned anthology edited by Orson Scott Card, entitled Eutopia, in which all stories would be about a group attempting to create a utopian society. Each story would be told from the perspective of a member of that society who believed in that idea of utopia. Resnick requested and received permission to submit the story to a magazine in addition to the anthology. The originally-planned anthology was never published.

It travels through the Norne Gas Export Pipeline and the √Ösgard Transport trunkline via K√•rst√∏ north of Stavanger to continental Europe. Development The Alve find led to the discovery of the Norne oil and gas field which was proven in 1992 and brought on stream in 1997. The field has been developed with a production and storage vessel, connected to six subsea wellhead templates. Flexible risers carry the wellstream up to the vessel, which rotates around a cylindrical turret moored to the seabed. Risers and umbilicals are also connected to the turret. The ship has a processing plant on deck and storage tanks for stabilised oil. Production Production began from Norne in the Norwegian Sea on 6 November 1997. The Norne field produces around of medium density, low sulphur, waxy North Sea crude oil. Originally, the shut down of Norne was scheduled for 2014.

However sex workers are often discriminated against and access to health services limited. Kenya is one of the world's most HIV affected countries. Sex workers are the most affected group within the country. Research has shown that around 30% of sex workers are HIV positive. Lack of condom use, (both amongst sex workers and the general public), fuelled the spread of HIV and other STIs. Since 2001, the Kenyan Government has been distributing free condoms (180 million in 2013) and educating the public on their use. The University of Nairobi and Prof Elizabeth Ngugi established a program with local prostitutes to educate and empower them by encouraging condom use. A study of Nairobi sex workers in 2015 reported about two thirds always use condoms with clients. This compares with 40% amongst members of the general public who have two or more partners. HIV and STI testing is voluntary, however as the HIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Act 2006 criminalised HIV transmission, there is some reluctance for sex workers to get tested.

Sex trafficking Kenya is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Boys were increasingly subjected to trafficking. Girls and boys are exploited in commercial sex throughout Kenya, including in sex tourism in Nairobi, Kisumu, and on the coast, particularly in informal settlements; at times, their exploitation is facilitated by family members. Children are also exploited in sex trafficking by people working in khat (a mild narcotic) cultivation areas, near gold mines in western Kenya, by truck drivers along major highways, and by fishermen on Lake Victoria. Kenyans are recruited by legal or illegal employment agencies or voluntarily migrate to Europe, the United States, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Oman, in search of employment, where at times they are exploited in massage parlours and brothels,. Reports allege gay and bisexual Kenyan men are deceptively recruited from universities with promises of overseas jobs, but are forced into prostitution in Qatar and UAE. Kenyan women are subjected to forced prostitution in Thailand by Ugandan and Nigerian traffickers. Some children in Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps may be subjected to sex trafficking. Children from East Africa and South Sudan are subjected to sex trafficking in Kenya. Trucks transporting goods from Kenya to Somalia returned to Kenya with girls and women subsequently exploited in brothels in Nairobi or Mombasa. Nepalese and Indian women recruited to work in mujra dance clubs in Nairobi and Mombasa face debt bondage, which they are forced to pay off by dancing and forced prostitution.

Their own record label, Crazy Dancer Records, is distributed by Poptones, the label run by Alan McGee, who has served as DJ for them, and has described them as \\"ABBA meets Phil Spector\\". The band was conceived by Adam Howarth, formerly of the surf- rock group Captain Soul, who wanted to put together a contemporary version of The Ronettes. Vitorino and Masters answered an ad in NME, and then Magnberg was brought in from near Gothenburg. Their first single, in 2005, was \\"You're the Loser\\", on the indie label Fierce Panda Records. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2007. In 2008, they entered the Eurovision - Your Decision finals, hoping to represent the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"It's You\\". They reached the second stage where their song was voted on by the public, but failed to make the final sing-off. Earlier in the evening they had been criticised by the judging panel for a weak vocal performance, with particular criticism being levelled at Magnberg who judge Carrie Grant accused of being too weak vocally to lead the song. They represented the UK at the OGAE Second Chance Contest, which is a contest of rejected songs from the national finals organized by fans. Despite gaining four sets of maximum points, they ultimately finished in 16th place. \\"It's You\\" was released as a single on 10 November 2008 but failed to chart.

Its history is closely connected with nearby Buchlov Castle which grew more and more uncomfortable in the late 17th century, and that is why Jan Dƒõt≈ôich of Pet≈ôwald decided to build a new castle. Buchlovice castle was built as a copy of an Italian villa in baroque style,Krob, Miroslav (1997), ƒåesk√° republika, Kvarta. p. 285. by Domenico Martinelli. It is one of the most romantic buildings in this country. In 1800 it became property of the Berchtolds, and since 1945 the state castle is open to the public. History The area around Buchlovice was inhabited as early as the Stone Age, and the first written records of this district date from 1270. In 1540 Buchlovice became part of the estate of nearby Buchlov castle. This medieval fortress, which did not meet the increasing demands for a comfortable and prestigious residence, ceased to suit its owners, who decided at the beginning of the 18th century to replace it with the grandiose ch√¢teau in Buchlovice. Jan Dƒõtr√≠ch of Pet≈ôvald had the chateau built according to the proposals of Italian architect Domenico Martinelli between 1707 and 1738. The ch√¢teau complex is made up the ceremonial building known as the Doln√≠ z√°mek (Lower Ch√¢teau), and the building known as Horn√≠ z√°mek (Upper Ch√¢teau), which had a service function. A courtyard of honour extends between the two. Around the ch√¢teau an Italian- style park was created, which was extended and altered in the English style in the first half of the 19th century and is among the most valuable of its kind in the Czech Republic.Ehrenberger, Toma≈° (2003), The 88 Most Beautiful Castles, pg. 30, Kartografie Praha a.s., After the Pet≈ôvald dynasty died out the ch√¢teau was acquired in 1800 by the Berchtolds. In 1807 Leopold I Berchtold established a military hospital in part of the ch√¢teau and a drapery in the stables. The ch√¢teau is open to the public and visitors can admire the state rooms, and chambers with rich stucco work and painted ceilings.

Bender is most closely identified with the Cincinnati Reds, where he spent 39 years (1967‚Äì2005) as a front office executive and consultant. An associate of general manager Bob Howsam, Bender was Cincinnati's farm system director of the \\"Big Red Machine\\" era and served in that post for 22 years, 1967‚Äì88.

He then scouted for the Cardinals and moved into their front office as director of player development when Howsam became Redbird GM in mid-August 1964. Bender was one of a handful of St. Louis executives who followed Howsam to Cincinnati in January 1967. He was one of Howsam's most trusted aides. \\"He had a vitally important role on every major decision made under Howsam\\", said longtime Reds broadcaster Marty Brennaman upon Bender's death. \\"When they made the trade with Houston in (that netted Joe Morgan, among others), he was there.\\"Cincinnati Enquirer, Feb. 28, 2008 Bender also played a role in bringing Baseball Hall of Fame manager Sparky Anderson to the Reds; as farm director of the Cardinals and then the Reds, he had hired Anderson to minor-league managerial posts in 1965 and 1968.

A series of mass protests were held in Armenia in the wake of the Armenian presidential election of 19 February 2008. Mass protests against alleged electoral fraud were held in the capital city of Yerevan and organised by supporters of the unsuccessful presidential candidate and first President of Armenia, Levon Ter-Petrosyan. The protests began on 20 February, lasted for 10 days in Yerevan's Freedom Square, and involved tens of thousands of demonstrators during the day and hundreds camping out overnight. Despite the urges of the government to stop the demonstrations, the protests continued until 1 March. After nine days of peaceful protests at the Freedom Square, the national police and military forces tried to disperse the protesters on 1 March.\\"Report by the Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Thomas Hammarberg, on his special mission to Armenia, 12‚Äì15 march 2008\\", Council of Europe, 20 March 2008.

Police officers pulled away from the area by 16:00, as they were overwhelmed by the growing number of demonstrators. Activists then used abandoned police buses to set up barricades. In the evening, clashes broke out between riot police and about 2,000 protesters who barricaded themselves at Miasnikyan Square. At around 22:00, President Robert Kocharyan, with the approval of the Armenian parliament, declared a 20-day state of emergency, banning future demonstrations and censoring the media from broadcasting any political news except those issued by official state press releases.At Least Eight Killed In Armenian Post-Election Unrest\\", Armenia Liberty ([RFE/RL]), 2 March 2008. Kocharian justified the decision on the grounds that a minority of demonstrators looted a nearby grocery store on Mashtots Avenue and set fire to a handful of police vehicles and buses (while the riot police, special forces and army looked on from 1 km away from Shahumyan Square without intervening). Opposition leaders say that the looters had nothing to do with the demonstration, and that they were led by agent provocateurs. With the state of emergency in effect, at around 4:00 on 2 March, Levon Ter-Petrosyan asked the protesters near the French Embassy to go home, thus ending the protests. The tragic events of 1 March 2008 are simply referred to as Marti mek ( \\"March First\\") in Armenia. Background Levon Ter-Petrosyan was the President of Armenia from 16 October 1991 to 3 February 1998. Ter-Petrosyan was forced to step down in February 1998 for a number of reasons, including allegations of election fraud and generally having lost support in the parliament. He was succeeded by his then Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan. Kocharyan was re- elected for a second term as president on 5 March 2003 amid allegations of electoral fraud. In early 2004 there were demonstrations by opposition-led protestors and calls for Kocharyan's resignation. Kocharyan completed his second term as president in February 2008 and under the Armenian constitution was not eligible for a third term. Kocharyan's Prime Minister Serge Sargsyan had Kocharyan's backing for his candidacy as the next president. Ter-Petrosyan was also a candidate for this election, having announced his candidacy during a speech in Yerevan on 26 October 2007, in which he accused Kocharyan's government of massive corruption involving the theft of \\"at least three to four billion dollars\\" over the previous five years.Emil Danielian and Liz Fuller, \\"Armenian Ex-President Confirms Comeback Plans\\", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 1 November 2007. The election was held on 19 February 2008 and Sargsyan won the election with 53% of the vote, according to official results, with Ter-Petrosyan in second place with 22% of the vote. Under Armenia's electoral law, if neither candidate wins at least 50% of the votes, the top two contenders have to face each other in a second round of the elections. International observers from the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe, PACE and the European Parliament had said that \\"the presidential election in Armenia mostly satisfied the international standards\\".International observers: Armenian presidential election mostly in accordance with international standards Regnum, 20 February 2008 Timeline The protests began on 20 February; about 25,000 opposition supporters were reportedly present on 21 February. Ter-Petrosyan said that the army would not act against the protesters, claiming to have the support of two deputy defense ministers. An aide to Ter-Petrosyan vowed that the protests would continue \\"nonstop\\" and demanded that the government agree to holding a new election by 22 February.\\"Thousands challenge victory of Armenian PM in presidential vote in 2nd day of protests\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 21 February 2008. On 21 February, two members of the Central Election Commission who are representatives of the opposition said that they did not accept the results, and on the next day, Vahan Hovhannisian resigned from his position as deputy speaker of National Assembly of Armenia due to his disapproval of the handling of the election and said that the mechanism of falsifications were put in operation in 1996 by Ter-Petrosyan. Protests continued on 22 February, and Deputy Prosecutor-General Gagik Jhangirian condemned the election, urging the people to act immediately to defend their votes, rather than complaining later about the government's behavior. A spokesperson for Prosecutor-General Aghvan Hovsepian asked Kocharyan to dismiss Jhangirian because prosecutors cannot be members of any party or to be involved in politics in any way The Defense Ministry denied Ter-Petrosyan's claim that the two deputy defense ministers had said that they would prevent the army from being used against the protesters, but the veterans' group Yerkrapah disputed this denial.\\"Armenia: Opposition Protests Gain Momentum With High-Ranking Support\\", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 22 February 2008. Protests were held without an official permission. Part of the cause for the protest were oppositions claim that there were widespread violations,\\"Protesters challenge Armenian vote\\", Associated Press (MiamiHerald.com), 21 February 2008. and the suppression of this belief. Armenian Public Television (H1) has received criticism for failing to show the intense protesting, instead promoting a peaceful aura following the election. =22 February= On the third day of the protests, 22 February, the number of protesters was reported as about 30,000. Sarkisyan called the protests \\"blackmail' and said that if they violated the law, order would be restored through force. The opposition's Alexander Arzoumanian, however, said that the government did not have the courage to attempt to break up the protests. On 23 February, the number of protesters was reported as about 50,000. Kocharyan accused the opposition of trying to seize power and warned that the government would act to preserve order. Meanwhile, the police released a statement saying that they were \\"prepared to resolutely respond to any attempts to disturb public order and destabilize the situation, prevent extremist manifestations, and protect people's constitutional rights\\". The statement denied the rumored resignation of police chief Hayk Harutyunyan.\\"Armenian police ready to respond to attempts to disturb public order ‚Äì statement\\" , Interfax, 23 February 2008. =23 February= Jhangirian was dismissed as Deputy Prosecutor-General by Kocharyan on 23 February and detained later that day.\\"Gagik Jahangiryan dismissed from post of deputy prosecutor general\\", PanARMENIAN.Net, 23 February 2008.

Ter-Petrosyan made several appearances, and in each called for a peaceful rally, frequently alluding to the late-1980s when the Karabakh Committee was arrested by the Soviets. Ter- Petrosyan said that he does not fear arrest nor assassination, and that if the ruling party had him killed, it would only accelerate its own demise. Also on 25 February, Sarkis Hatspanian, a diasporan Armenian from France, spoke twice, and alluded to the participation of Armenians in revolutionary movements in France and Germany, and how the turn has come for Armenia. Around 10‚Äì15,000 people continued to participate in the rally well into midnight, some staying overnight in tents. =26 February= On 26 February, there were widespread reports that high school administrators had been directed by the ruling party to have their students participate in a pro-Sargsyan rally held in Republic Square. Many e-mail services had been blocked since the morning of 26 February, including Hotmail, Gmail, and thick-client email programs using the IMAP protocol. Several prominent supporters of Ter-Petrosyan were arrested on 26 February. On that day competing rallies were held, with Sargysan's supporters reported to number up to 100,000. Ter-Petrosyan claimed that the numbers attending his rally had doubled because people were leaving Sargysan's rally to come to his. Meanwhile, the National Security Service said that it had prevented an opposition plot to seize a television broadcasting tower in Yerevan; it said that the purpose of this alleged plot, for which several people were arrested, was to enable Ter-Petrosyan to make a live broadcast. An opposition spokesman dismissed this as \\"psychological pressure\\". Also on 26 February, Kocharyan suggested that his government's patience with the protests had \\"a limit\\" and urged people to \\"come to their senses\\".\\"Armenian police detain more activists as gov't, opposition supporters hold dueling rallies\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 26 February 2008. =27 February= On 27 February, an even larger group of protesters than previous days marched on the streets along Abovian and Mashdots Avenue.\\"Ralliers 'Thanked' the Police\\" , A1+, 27 February 2008. The evening again saw protester numbers in the tens of thousands, with an increasing number of tents. The crowd was mixed, there were groups of villagers (tens in each), students, families with children, government workers, in addition to opposition leaders. At around 11:30 pm some protesters started to rush towards the caf√© adjacent to Freedom Square named \\"Karapi Lij\\" (Swan Lake). A protest leader announced that all available journalists should go there to photograph \\"something interesting\\" that was about to happen, and also called for the general populace to return to the square. Several score of military police, civil police, as well as secret police went into the subterranean caf√©, emerging after 15‚Äì20 minutes with 3 arrested suspects who were secret agent provocateurs with undercover recording equipment trying to get opposition leaders (who were in the caf√©) to say or perform illegal acts.\\"‘≤’å’Ü‘µ‘º ‘µ’Ü ’ä’ê’à’é’à‘ø‘±’è’à’ê’Ü‘µ’ê‘ª\\", A1+, 28 February 2008.

Secret police (which outnumbered uniformed police and military 3 to 1) would not allow journalists to take pictures; however, some were able to (despite their threats of impending danger to journalists' personal safety or destruction of their cameras). The rally later continued without interruption. =28 February= On 28 February, starting from the morning, police cars surrounded the streets around Freedom Square, not allowing passengers to be dropped off or picked up, let alone to park.\\"Cars Are Taken Away\\" , A1+, 28 February 2008. =29 February= On 29 February, another march around town attracted an even larger group of ralliers, with at least 100,000 participants.

Witnesses say that the government authorities planted guns and grenades among the sleeping protesters, and then claiming that they were thwarting an attempted coup, attacked the protesters.Bloody Saturday: A breakdown of the day that broke a nation, ArmeniaNow.com, 21 March 2008. Police used bludgeons and electric shockers to beat and electrocute the ralliers. Levon Ter-Petrosyan was captured at Freedom Square and placed under house arrest. Some fled when police attacked them. Dozens were reported to have sustained severe injuries and more than 100 protesters were arrested. A witness told Human Rights Watch that several rows of Special Forces in riot armor, with helmets, plastic shields and rubber truncheons, started approaching from the left and right sides of Freedom Square. The witness said that police, without prior warning, sprayed water and descended on the demonstrators, using rubber truncheons and electric prods. \\"People started running towards Northern Avenue, but were chased by the police.\\" By 11:00 am, Freedom Square was completely cordoned off by police and large water cannons were being used to clear the site of debris and blood (with riot police trying to prevent passersby from taking photographs). The Karapi Lich caf√© was cordoned off with a large canvas so that it could not be seen what took place inside. 4:30 pm: Over 100,000 demonstrators at French Embassy protest the government's attack in early morning At about 11:30 am, a peaceful march of about 1,000 people from near Freedom Square, down North Avenue, and to the French Embassy at Miyasnikyan Square (where riot police were quickly redeployed to). By 1:30 pm, a police armored personnel carrier was brought in, which the growing crowd quickly surrounded. By 2 pm, about 150,000 protesters‚Äîlarger than on any other day‚Äîhad gathered in the square. By that time there were about 3,000 riot police and special police forces present. The sheer number of protesters outnumbered the police, who were forced by the peaceful protesters to retreat. By 5 pm, all armored personnel carriers and all other military special vehicles as well as troops had been evacuated from the square. Protesters gradually confiscated the remaining buses and moved them to strategic locations to block incoming traffic to the square. It is notable that several agent provocateurs were detected by the crowd and swiftly removed. At around 3:30 pm, an unmarked white police car drove straight through the crowd at high speed. At least two women were run over and taken to hospital with injuries. The car was stopped by the crowd and set afire, as the policeman driving it fled the scene.\\"Yerevan Protests Resume Despite Government Crackdown\\" , Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 2 March 2008. As of 6:30 pm, at least 30 buses, each with about 30 army soldiers armed with AK-47 and M-16 assault rifles, were seen near Republic Square (in anticipation of Kocharian's state of emergency). Around 10:30 pm, Kocharyan declared a 20-day state of emergency. This meant that \\"all rallies and other public gatherings will be banned in Yerevan until March 20. It also places serious restrictions on press freedom, with local media outlets allowed to report only official news communiqu√©s.\\"\\"Armenian Opposition Ends Protests After Ter-Petrosyan Appeal\\" , Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 2 March 2008. Clashes between the police and security forces and agitated protesters seem to have occurred on at least three occasions during the course of 1 March: The first in the morning hours, the second at around 9:15 pm, and the third late night. According to eyewitnesses (among them an RFE/RL correspondent) security forces‚Äîwithout prior warning‚Äîfired tracer bullets over the crowd for more than 40 minutes in an attempt to disperse the crowd\\"Sarkisian Defends Use Of Force Against Opposition\\" , Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 27 June 2008. (this is confirmed in an independent YouTube video). In the meantime, a unit of riot troops charged towards one of the barricades but fled the scene after unsuccessful pitched battles with opposition supporters who were armed with sticks, stones and Molotov cocktails. Shortly after the event, a controversial independent video appeared on YouTube showing special forces firing automatic weapons directly into the crowd, directly followed by a clip in which the Prosecutor General's press secretary (Sona Truzyan) claims that police did not fire any weapons into the crowd. Government sources claimed that the video footage was faked and that it was digitally doctored. =2 March= Midnight and early morning By 12:00 am, the area around the French embassy had only about 5,000 activists left. The police stood about 1/2 km north at Shahumyan Square, passively watching as anarchy reigned on the area below. Miyasnikyan square to Mashdots Avenue was completely devoid of any law enforcement, and authorities watched passively as some of the crowd looted some stores. Despite calls from opposition leaders throughout the demonstrations to restrain the use of violence, some in the crowd (allegedly encouraged by agent provocateurs) resorted to property destruction (of cars, windows, public places) and looting of a grocery store and a shoe store. (ArmeniaNow reports that the 2 pharmacies and 4 electronics and computer stores were not looted.) By 1:00 am, several buses and cars had been destroyed, set ablaze, or turned over near Miyasnikyan square. By 2:30 am, some of the bus loads of army soldiers were bused into Shahumyan square to join rows of riot police. Demonstrators were seen armed with metal bars (removed from park gates) and Molotov cocktails made from water bottles. Many of the demonstrators were not there to specifically support Levon Ter- Petrosyan, but were there to show their support for a change in government. Only a minority of the group resorted to looting, and most of the crowd stayed within the vicinity of Miyasnikyan Square. Official reports say that ten people died on the night of 1 March;Death toll in March 1‚Äì2 clashes in Yerevan reaches 10 however, according to representatives of non-governmental organizations, the official number of injured civilians may be underreported, as several of those injured were turned away from hospitals and medical clinics on 1 March. According to the information given by the Head of Police and Prosecutor General, a police officer died trying to prevent a hand grenade from going off. Three civilians died from teargas cartridge and four from bullets. The Prosecutor General stated that the ammunitions had penetrated the bodies, which appears to indicate that they must have been fired at a very close range. According to the Head of Police some protesters were armed with wooden sticks, iron sticks and \\"hedgehogs\\". He also stated that the protesters used fire arms ‚Äì but this was contested by the representatives of the opposition who met with the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights. Day time As of 9 am, Ter-Petrosyan urged his supporters to go home from the protest, citing Kocharian's state of emergency. The government alleged that protesters were carrying firearms. However, other than metal bars and some Molotov cocktails, no reporters had seen arms in the possession of protesters. By 11 am, at least a dozen army armored personnel carriers and about 500 soldiers wielding assault rifles were positioned in Republic Square, maintaining the state of emergency's policy of a ban on public demonstrations and meetings. The stage at Freedom Square has been surrounded by 6 army transportation trucks. Photography was strictly prohibited. Yerevan was said to be all but a ghost town, with soldiers outnumbering citizens. The National Assembly confirmed Kocharyan's state of emergency, with 81 of the 131 members of parliament present voting in favor of it.\\"Armenia: Eight Killed After Clashes Between Police, Protesters\\", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 2 March 2008. =21 March= In a silent protest, a young woman holds pictures of some of the 106 political prisoners Following the end of the state of emergency, thousands of people in Yerevan held a candlelight vigil for the victims of 1 March and a silent protest on 21 March 2008 to protest the 106 protesters who had been arrested in the original protests.\\"A Candlelight Vigil and Silent Protest Procession\\" , Hetq Online, 22 March 2008. Their plan was to assemble at Freedom Square at 3 pm and hold a candlelight vigil there for those who died on 1 March, followed by a silent protest from 5 pm to 7 pm of a single line stretching from Freedom Square, down Northern Avenue, to Myasnikian Square. However, riot police confronted the protesters and used force to disperse them.\\"Protests Resume In Yerevan Amid Heavy Security\\", Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), 21 March 2008. Senior police officers told protesters to leave the area and cross the streets surrounding it, citing a continuing government ban on rallies. \\"Ten people standing together means a rally, and I have the right to disperse a rally,\\" Major-General Sasha Afian, deputy chief of Armenia's Police Service, told a group of angry women. Freedom Square was occupied by busloads of police and interior troops who prevented citizens to enter Freedom Square; Shahumyan Square and Myasnikian Square similarly had rows of riot police who prevented a public assembly in the area. At 7 p.m. the assembled crowds of silent protesters dispersed as planned. Although the state of emergency has been lifted by law, the ban on public rallies is de facto still in place. On the same day, the following campaign team members of Levon Ter-Petrosyan were taken into custody: Vardan Galstyan, Davit Tzaghikyan, Onik Hakobyan, Suren Sujyan, Edvard Sarajanyan and Hakob Semirjyan. =22 March= Riot police continue to block public access to Freedom Square, Shahumyan Square, and Myasnikian Square; they were also in formation at Republic Square. Police dispersed a growing crowd‚Äîmostly composed of women‚Äîthat was assembling at Northern Avenue. A Reuters reporter was notified by the police that any attempt by the public to hold a similar \\"silent protest\\" as the day before would be met by resistance from the police.

Government response The President Elect Sargsian, during his meeting with EU special envoy for the South Caucasus Peter Semneby, said \\"We are ready to cooperate with all those who wants Armenia to develop, its citizens to prosper, the country to be stable and strong, and we are ready for an open, straightforward and honest discussion\\". He also said that \\"those who incited recent riots had committed a crime and should be punished\\".

They were however concerned over the possibility of new demonstrations, rallies and riots in the streets. In this context, on 17 March, the Parliament initiated a first reading of proposed amendments to the law on holding meetings, rallies, marches, and demonstrations in an extraordinary session. On 18 March, President Robert Kocharian signed into law a parliament bill that will make it easier for the Armenian authorities to ban fresh anti-government demonstrations planned by opposition leader Levon Ter-Petrosyan.\\"Government Signals Ban On Ter-Petrosyan Rallies\\", Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), 18 March 2008. The existing law had until then allowed authorities to ban those demonstrations which they believed were aimed, among other things, at a \\"violent overthrow of constitutional order.\\" One of the amendments of the new law complements the clause with cases where authorities have \\"reliable information\\" that street protests would pose a threat to \\"state security, public order, public health and morality,\\" and that any such information coming from the Armenian police and the National Security Service (NSS) will be automatically deemed \\"reliable.\\" Also, a more significant amendment to the existing law allows the authorities to \\"temporarily\\" ban rallies for an unspecified period of time after street gatherings resulting in casualties. The ban shall remain in force until the end of the official investigation into a particular case of deadly street violence. Furthermore, the amendments also stipulate that a responsible agency examine a request for holding a public event for 72 hours. Requests are to be submitted 5 days prior to the date of holding a public event. According to the Council of Europe, these amendments entail \\"important changes and serious restrictions on the current national regime of freedom of assembly.\\" Previously the municipal authorities only needed to be notified of the intent to hold rallies, demonstrations or manifestations. According to the Council of Europe, the amendments full conformity with article 11 paragraph 2 (the right to freedom of assembly and association) of the European Convention can be questioned. In addition to Sarkisian's Republican Party (HHK), parliamentary leaders of the Prosperous Armenia, Dashnaktsutyun and Orinats Yerkir parties supported the new bill; Only members of Zharangutyun, the sole opposition party represented in the parliament, and independent lawmaker Victor Dallakian voted against the legislation.

Opposition response Opposition leaders who organized the rally disavowed and condemned 1 March's looting of dozens of a nearby supermarket and burning of parked cars, blaming them on government \\"provocateurs.\\" \\"We have nothing to do with that,\\" said Nikol Pashinian, an opposition leader. \\"The authorities themselves are destabilizing the situation.\\" During his 11 March news conference, Ter- Petrosyan alleged that government agents provoked the unrest. \\"Not even one car had been scratched [during protests and marches] prior to March 1. So what happened?\\" Ter-Petrosyan said, according to a report distributed by the Regnum news agency. \\"Provocateurs went after the protesters with clubs. ‚Ä¶ That was the reason the situation spiraled out of control, although it was brilliantly managed by authorities.\\" During the weekend of 15‚Äì16 March, Ter-Petrosyan and his opposition allies remaining at large held a meeting for the first time since the 1 March government attack, and said they will continue to work for regime change in Armenia by \\"legal and democratic means.\\"\\"Ter-Petrosyan, Allies Discuss Next Steps\\", Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), 17 March 2008. Ter- Petrosyan's office said that the participants of the meeting \\"reaffirmed their determination to fight against the kleptocratic system.\\" During the week of 10 March, the Ter-Petrosyan's representatives requested permission from Yerevan mayor's office to hold a rally on 21 March (the day after the anticipated end of emergency rule); this request has been rejected. Raffi Hovannisian's Zharangutyun party said in a statement that \\"the schism between the Armenian people and its government continues to expand,\\" that the presidential ballot was fraudulent and that Armenians had a legitimate right to dispute its official results in the streets. It said the 1 March bloodshed resulted from the break-up of non-stop protests in Yerevan's Freedom Square staged by the Ter-Petrosyan camp. \\"The unconscionability displayed on February 19 and the brutality used to protect it on March 1 remain unresolved issues,\\" said the statement. \\"No state of emergency, accompanied as it is by an aggressive, one- sided 'public information' vertical which deepens the public divide rather than healing it, will succeed in securing the collective amnesia of state and society.\\" =Response to new law banning rallies= On 18 March, Levon Ter- Petrosyan rejected as unconstitutional the new amendments to Armenia's law (passed at an emergency session of the National Assembly on 17 March) that will make it easier for authorities to ban new anti-government demonstrations. In a statement, his office said that the enacted amendments \\"blatantly violate\\" Armenians' constitutionally guaranteed freedom of assembly and can therefore be ignored by citizens. \\"In these circumstances, it is the people's legitimate right to ignore the illegal ban and reaffirm their freedom to hold rallies which is guaranteed by the constitution and international law.\\" \\"In reality, this is an attempt to perpetuate the state of emergency,\\" Levon Zurabian, an aide to Ter-Petrosyan, told RFE/RL. \\"A regime which attacked peaceful demonstrators and whose illegal actions left many people dead is using its own crime as a pretext to restrict our people's right to hold peaceful rallies... This shows that the authorities are terrified by the existing situation and that they admit having no popular support\\"  Response of media  ArmeniaNow has announced that it will remain under a media blackout until the State of Emergency has been suspended, because it feels that the \\"latest changes in Yerevan's State of Emergency still leave wide control and leeway for media censorship which has already been exercised in state restrictions of newspapers on the first day of the revised provisions.\\"Armenia Now, 14 March 2008. International reaction The European Union and some Western governments have demanded from the Armenian government a lifting of the 20-day state of emergency. On 2 March, Holly Cartner, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch said in a statement: \\"The Armenian government should refrain from using violence and make clear that it won‚Äôt tolerate excessive use of force by police... A political crisis doesn‚Äôt give the government carte blanche in how it responds to demonstrators.\\" \\"The Armenian government prides itself on having a democratic image,\\" said Cartner. \\"Beating peaceful demonstrators is inconsistent with that image and violates its obligations under human rights law.\\" In a second statement, Cartner said, \\"The Armenian government should swiftly investigate whether the police and army used lethal force against protesters in accordance with international standards. While the government has a duty to maintain civic order, lethal force may only be used when strictly necessary to protect life.\\"\\"Armenia: Civilians Die as Police Suppress Demonstrations and Riots\\", Human Rights Watch, 2 March 2008. On 3 March, the Committee to Protect Journalists said that Armenian authorities \\"should immediately lift restrictions on independent news reporting and the censorship of independent news Web sites.\\" \\"We're alarmed by this blatant attempt to censor news of the disputed election,\\" CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon said. \\"We call on Armenian authorities to withdraw the ban on independent news gathering and dissemination, and restore access to independent and opposition media.\\"\\"ARMENIA: Restrictions imposed as president declares emergency\\", Committee to Protect Journalists, 3 March 2008.

Glassman, Chairman of the BBG.\\"Statement of the Broadcasting Board of Governors on Closure of Independent Media in Armenia\\" , Broadcasting Board of Governors, 5 March 2008. On 7 March, Kurt Volker, the US acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: \\"We don't believe that [a] further crackdown, further arrests, are the right way to go.\\" He went on to urge the immediate lifting of the state of emergency imposed by Kocharian on 1 March.\\"Armenia: Authorities Advance Conspiracy Theory\\" , Armenia: Vote 2008 (Eurasianet.org), 11 March 2008.

It is urgent to restore a situation where the activities of the media, political parties and non-governmental organisations are not hindered.\\" On 12 March, the European Union reiterated its calls for the Armenian authorities to lift the state of emergency in Yerevan, release all political prisoners and agree to an \\"independent investigation\\" into the country's deadly post-election unrest.\\"EU Concerned About Armenian Crackdown\\", Armenia Liberty (RFE/RL), 13 March 2008. The government of Slovenia, holder of the EU's rotating presidency, also said on behalf of the block, \\"The Presidency calls again upon the Armenian authorities to release citizens detained in connection with their political activities and to refrain from further arrests of opposition leaders.\\" On 14 March, Thomas Hammarberg, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, called for an independent investigation into Armenia's deadly post- election unrest and said opposition supporters arrested by the authorities in recent weeks have been ill-treated in custody. \\"There have been cases where there were problems... Some of those arrested have been beaten, which of course is not acceptable\\" he said after his meetings in Armenian prisons of the political prisoners. Hammarberg \\"appeared to have serious misgivings about the official version of events.\\" \\"I really think that there is a need for a professional, independent and impartial inquiry into what happened,\\" he said, adding that it should be conducted by special commission made up of individuals \\"trusted by the public.\\" Hammarberg also told Kocharian and Sarkisian that the recent day's easing of civil liberty restrictions stemming from the state of emergency in Yerevan is \\"not sufficient\\" and specifically urged them to abolish \\"censorship\\" of the Armenian media.\\"Armenian Oppositionists ‚ÄòTortured In Jail‚Äô\\", Armenia Liberty RFE/RL, 14 March 2008.

On 20 March, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights released a report summarizing his findings during his 12‚Äì15 March trip to Armenia. The report is critical of the government's abuse of force, stating, \\"It seems clear that excessive use of force was used by police and the security forces.\\" According to the report the two sides‚Äîgovernment authorities and opposition protesters‚Äîdescribe the events of 1 March \\"very differently.\\" Since it is important in a human rights perspective to establish the basic facts, the report calls for a \\"comprehensive inquiry\\" that is \\"independent, impartial and transparent and perceived as credible by the whole population.\\" Also, it criticized the behavior of riot police, stating, \\"A review seems necessary of the current riot control measures used by the police as serious mistakes were made.\\" Aftermath Since 2 March, riot police and army occupy and block access to Freedom Square as well as to other major squares in Yerevan The Armenian police arrested 30 protestors accusing them of starting the riot. The Armenian Medical Centre (the former Republican hospital) treated civilians which had concussions from the beating by the police in connection with arrest. A number of them claimed to have been persons only passing by the demonstration. One patient had been hit by a bullet which had perforated his jaw and he could not speak. Another civilian could not be visited as he was in severe condition and held in reanimation. Several civilians who had sought medical assistance following the riots of 1 March had been denied assistance or turned down by the some hospitals. Also, it happened that patients released from the hospitals had been immediately arrested. At least 106 members of the opposition have been arrested, and Levon Ter-Petrosyan has been under de facto house arrest since 1 March. =Arrests= According to article 130 of the Criminal Procedures Code, a person can be held for twenty-four hours without charges. Over 400 persons have been apprehended and asked to give testimony of the events on 1 March. On 13 March the Prosecutor General informed that over 95 persons had been arrested for having organized or participated in demonstrations and mass disturbances of public order. Information provided by non-governmental sources on 15 March stated that an additional 50 persons had been arrested, mostly outside of Yerevan in major cities of Armenia like Gyumri. =Police brutality= According to the Council of Europe Commissioner of Human Rights, Thomas Hammarberg who visited a number of detainees in Nubarashen Prison, the Temporary holding facility of the National Security Service and the Holding Centre of Yerevan City Police Department, \\"the number of injured persons and detainees still after fourteen days showing marks of beating is clearly a matter of grave concern.\\" The Commissioner has stated that allegations of police brutality should be investigated. =Fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh= Skirmishes between the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army and the Military of Azerbaijan were reported along the contact line near the Mardakert. These skirmishes were the worst fighting along the contact line since the ceasefire after the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994 and have caused several fatalities. The Armenian side blames Azerbaijan for trying to take advantage of unrest in Armenia. The Azeri side blames Armenia claiming that they are trying to divert attention from problems at home but Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has also said his country is ready to re-take the region by force, and has been buying the military hardware and ammunition to do so.Deadly Fighting Reported In Karabakh Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty 4 March 2008 Constitutional Court decision On 9 March 2008, the Constitutional Court officially rejected the opposition's claim that the election was rigged.

It closed in February 2008. A tiny, 23-seat venue, sited in a back garden in the town of Gorseinon, near Swansea, 'La Charrette' (French for 'the carriage') was built from a disused railway carriage. With flock wallpaper and hand-operated curtains, 'La Charrette' began showing films in 1953. La Charrette, at Parkmill, Gower  History  The cinema was originally constructed and run by Gwyn Phillips, an electrician who fell in love with the movies in his youth while working as a projectionist. After Mr Phillips died in 1996, 'La Charrette' was kept open by his widow, Rita. A meticulously kept, hand-written record of every film shown at the cinema reveals that the first movie to be screened there in 1953 was Reluctant Heroes. That same year, locals were able to see Oliver Twist, King Kong and Winchester ‚Äò73. Later decades saw the screening of The French Connection and even the controversial Straw Dogs. More recently, Saving Private Ryan, Elizabeth and The Queen were shown.  Closure  Made unsafe by the irreparable decay of its wood-and-steel structure, 'La Charrette' was originally expected to close in October 2007 after a screening of Ocean's 13. However, a visit by film critic Mark Kermode for BBC2's The Culture Show resulted in the tiny venue being given a special send-off in February 2008. The event consisted of a special premiere screening of the previously unseen Danny Boyle film Alien Love Triangle (2002), starring Kenneth Branagh, Courteney Cox and Heather Graham. For the screening, Branagh made a personal appearance, while Cox and Graham recorded special messages.  Re-opening at the Gower Heritage Centre Following the screening the carriage was sliced into six pieces and removed from the back garden of the house in Gorseinon, near Swansea. The pieces were transported to the Gower peninsula and welded together and La Charrette was fully restored to its former glory as part of a restoration project funded by the Gower Heritage Centre in Gower.

Ethiopia has become a magnet for sex tourism, including child sex tourism. In 2015, Ethiopian scriptwriter and film director, Hermon Hailay, directed the film Price of Love, which was inspired by her experiences growing up close to prostitutes. Sex trafficking Ethiopia is a source and, to a lesser extent, destination and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Saudi Arabia remains the primary destination for irregular migrants; reportedly, over 400,000 Ethiopians reside there. Saudi officials regularly deport Ethiopians in large numbers, and many of the deportees reported instances of sexual exploitation. Ethiopian women who migrate for work or flee abusive employers in the Middle East are also vulnerable to sex trafficking. An international organization assesses that most traffickers are small local operators, often from the victims‚Äô own communities, but that well-organized crime groups are also responsible for irregular migrants becoming highly susceptible to trafficking. Labor recruiters target young people from Ethiopia's vast rural areas with promises of a better life. Although reports remain anecdotal, the severe drought in 2015-2016 may have resulted in an increase in internal trafficking. Girls from Ethiopia's impoverished rural areas are exploited in commercial sex within the country. Addis Ababa‚Äôs central market is the site of numerous brothels, where some young girls are exploited in commercial sex. Ethiopian girls are exploited in commercial sex in neighbouring African countries, particularly Sudan. Child sex tourism continues to be a problem in major hubs, including Addis Ababa, Bahir Dar, Hawassa, and Bishoftu; reports identify mostly Ethiopian-born perpetrators, including members of the diaspora, with known links to local hotels, brokers, and taxi drivers. In 2016, federal and regional justice officials investigated 1,392 potential trafficking cases and convicted 640 traffickers under the 2015 anti-trafficking law, a significant increase from 69 convictions in 2015. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Ethiopia as a 'Tier 2' country.

It is located in the southeast of the country, on the eastern side of what was once the Toliara Province. The name Anosy means \\"island(s)\\" in Malagasy. Due to a strategic sea route running along its coast, Anosy had been an important crossroads for the Malagasy, Muslims, and Europeans. In the mid-1600s, it was the location of the first French colonial settlement in the Indian Ocean. The region was part of the Imerina Kingdom for much of the 1800s and part of the French colony of Madagascar from the late 1800s to 1960. Its exports have included human slaves (shipped to the Mascarene Islands and the United States in the 1700s), live cattle (exported to R√©union for almost 300 years), sisal, natural rubber, rosy periwinkle, graphite, uranothorianite, lobster, sapphires, and ilmenite. Due to its biodiversity and unique wildlife, efforts commenced in the 1980s to promote environmental conservation and tourism in the region. The region suffers from poverty; 80% of inhabitants lack access to clean water, 16% suffer from serious respiratory illnesses, and literacy is less than 20%.

(also published separately in French). Anosy is a region in southeastern Madagascar, which covers . It borders Androy region to the southwest, across the Mandrare River. To the west is Atsimo-Andrefana, to the north is Ihorombe region, and to the northeast is Atsimo-Atsinanana region. To the east and south is the Indian Ocean. The region is approximately wide along its coastline and extends roughly inland. Anosy's capital and most- populous city is T√¥lanaro (formerly Fort Dauphin), located about halfway along the region's coast and south of the national capital of Antananarivo.Institut National de la Statistique, Antananarivo. Anosy means \\"island\\" or \\"islands\\" in Malagasy. It may have been named for the island in the Fanjahira river (now Efaho river) where the Zafiraminia first settled when they arrived in the 16th century. Another theory is that the name means \\"land of the islands\\" because of the many temporary islands created when the Efaho valley floods during the rainy season. Along the ocean are coastal lagoons and about of sandy, rolling coastal hills that butt up against the Vohimana mountains. This mountain range dominates the area, terminating just outside T√¥lanaro at Mount Bezavona (Pic St. Louis), which stands at . The interior bedrock is granite, with cordierite gneiss exposed where erosion had occurred along the coast. The sand dunes along the coast, which average in depth, have mineral deposits of ilmenite, zircon, rutile and monazite. There are three primary hydrologic drainage areas in Anosy: the Mountain Zone, the Bedrock Plain, and the Coastal Sands. The Mountain Zone covers 30% of the total catchment area and is distinguished by steep slopes, rapid runoff, and clearly defined rivers. The Bedrock Plain has rolling hills with low relief and several large rivers. The Coastal Sands are dunes at the ocean's edge cut with meandering rivers, ribbon lakes, and a series of lagoons and bays which vary in size from a few to two dozen square kilometres. The Coastal Sands can be further subdivided into the Andriambe, Ebakika, Efaho, Fanjahira, Lakandava, Lanirano, Manampanihy, Mandromodromotra, Vatomena, Vatomirindry and Vatorendrika basins. There are three major rivers in Anosy: the Mandrare River along the southwestern border, the Efaho (formerly called the Fanjahira) just west of T√¥lanaro, and the Manampanihy which drains the Ranomafana valley, emptying into the ocean at Manantenina. Hampel, Wolfgang. (n.d.). Stream sediment survey in South-Eastern Madagascar 2005‚Äì2006. Other rivers in the Anosy region include the Isoanala, Manambolo, Mangoky, Menarandra and Isoanala. = Climate = The average temperature in T√¥lanaro ranges from in January‚ÄìFebruary to in July, with ocean temperatures ranging from in January‚ÄìFebruary to in June‚ÄìJuly. The humidity of T√¥lanaro ranges from 77 to 84 percent. Rainfall is highest on the eastern side of the mountains. In general, Anosy is very wet and humid in the northeast and becomes increasingly arid as one moves southwest. T√¥lanaro receives of annual rainfall. Monthly precipitation is about in November through March, ) in April, and less than for September and October. T√¥lanaro is a windy town, with Force 6 winds () for 6 to 13 days per month, August through November. Ratsivalaka-Randriamanga S. (1985, Janvier-Juin).

In 1996, Anosy was recognized as one of the most ecologically diverse regions of Madagascar. In 2014, T√¥lanaro's coast was identified as seriously threatened due to \\"rise in sea level, landslides, and coastal erosion\\".Rahobisoa, J.-J., Rambolamanana Ratrimo, V. & Ranaivoarisoa, A. (2014). Mitigating coastal erosion in Fort Dauphin, Madagascar. In Kaneko, N., Yoshiura, S. & Kobayashi, M. (Eds.), Sustainable living with environmental risks, (pp. 147-166). New York: Springer Open.  Demographics  The region had a population of 809,313 in 2018. At its present growth rate, it is expected to double its population in 15 years. The region is administratively divided into three districts; population densities are in the T√¥lanaro District, in the Amboasary Atsimo District, and in the Betroka District. The people who have historically lived in Anosy are known as the Antanosy people. They may be more accurately described as \\"those from Anosy\\" given the region's history. The Antanosy live primarily in the east, along the coast and coastal rivers. There are also Antandroy living in the southwest, especially in the T√¥lanaro District and in the Amboasary-Sud District, along with other Malagasy people from other parts of Madagascar. The rural interior Betroka District is chiefly inhabited by Bara people. There are also Asians who own many shops in urban centres and Europeans working in conservation, mining, tourism or for the Catholic Church. While there had been many French nationals living in Anosy during the French occupation of Madagascar, most had left by the mid-1970s. Most of the people who live in Anosy are very poor, with an estimated GDP per capita in 2004 of just $180, when the national average was $210. Eighty percent of its inhabitants don't have access to clean water, one in six suffer from serious respiratory illness, literacy is less than 20%, and 65% of the watershed slopes are highly degraded.Di Boscio, N. (2010, March). Mining enterprises and regional economic development: An exploratory analysis of the sustainable development model. PhD Dissertation. London School of Economics and Political Science. The majority of those living in Anosy practice traditional folk religions. The two largest Christian denominations in the Anosy region are the Roman CatholicCongr√©gation de la Mission (Lazaristes) (Ed.). (1996). Le Christianisme dans le sud de Madagascar.

(2003, Juin). Monographie de la Region d'Anosy. = Governance = = Education = As of 1997‚Äì98, literacy at the primary level in Anosy was 22% for boys and 23% for girls. Literacy was below 20% in some rural areas. Of the 109 public primary schools in the T√¥lanaro district in 1997‚Äì98, the average class size was 42 students per teacher. For secondary education, there were 5 CEGs (college of general education) and 1 lyc√©e. The Amboasary district had 73 primary schools and 4 CEGs, while rural Anosy has few schools in a good state of repair. = Healthcare = Healthcare is a challenge, as 80% of the population doesn't have access to clean water. In 2010, WHO/UNICEF estimated that only 1 in 10 Malagasy had access to improved sanitation facilities, resulting in high child mortality. 40% of children in rural areas die before age 5. = Transportation = T√¥lanaro is serviced by Air Madagascar, with daily flights to and from the national capital, Antananarivo. Only 50% of roadways in Anosy were passable in 2009. Many roads are closed during the rainy season, and four-wheel drive is recommended. A paved road was built connecting T√¥lanaro‚ÄìAmboasary‚ÄìAmbovombe, but most of the surface has been wrecked. Some road repairs have been conducted with loans from the World Bank, and by international companies seeking access to the region's natural resources. Buses run both north and west from T√¥lanaro. Many are overcrowded and in poor repair, and some are simply trucks with metal benches. Ehoala Port, opened in 2009, has greatly improved Anosy's shipping, and was developed for export of ilmenite (see mining, below). The historic harbour of T√¥lanaro, about away, was known for a large number of ships which ran aground. Airports *Betroka Airport *T√¥lanaro Airport = Electrical infrastructure = The only towns in Anosy with electrical power grids are T√¥lanaro and Amboasary. The growth of T√¥lanaro and poor condition of its generators resulted in mining firm QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) assuming responsibility for production of the town's electricity. As of 2008, rural electrification in Anosy Region was only 7%. While a program entitled PEPSE Anosy was proposed to provide electricity from wind generators to eight towns, as of 2008 there was no evidence that this project had begun.[see Fondation Energies Pour le Monde (2008) Fondation Energies Pour le Monde.

Development & update of a strategy to minimize the environmental impact of energy in the Anosy Region, Madagascar. (for USAID)  Agriculture  Subsistence farming is the primary source of income of most people living in Anosy. Where there is sufficient rainfall, rice is the primary food crop, though in most cases only one crop is grown per year. Cassava is a very important food crop for those who can't afford rice year- round, which includes most of the Malagasy in the region. Yields for most crops are low, primarily due to the traditional methods of farming. = Cash crops = The three major cash crops in the Anosy region are coffee (primarily from the Ranomafana area), rosy periwinkle (southwestern coast of Anosy and coast of Androy) and sisal (Amboasary area). Malagasy rosy periwinkle was researched by Eli Lilly beginning in 1958 for its potential use in preserving insulin. This was unsuccessful, but chemotherapy agents were discovered which have been credited with increasing the survival rate for childhood leukemia.Dr. T. Ombrello - UCC Biology Department Neimark, B.D.

Sisal cultivation was tested in 1928 and intensive farming practices were begun in the 1950s, reaching peak production in the mid-1960s. The development of synthetic fibres has largely replaced it in the international market, but sisal remains an important export. Guerin, Michel. (1969?).

Mining  Mining has been occurring in Anosy beginning with the export of mica in the early 1900s. Uranothorianite was mined from the 1950s to the mid-1960s, for several years being Madagascar's second-most valuable export. Sapphires were a major export in the early- to mid-1990s. More recently, QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM), owned 80 percent by mining giant Rio Tinto Group and 20 percent by the Malagasy government, has mined and exported 750,000 tons per year of ilmenite, along with 40,000 tons per year of rutile and zircon. There are also major deposits of bauxite which might be developed in the future, and there has been ongoing exploration for uranium and rare earth minerals. Carter, J. (2010).

While mining exports have provided income for the government, there has been some skepticism of the benefits to the people in terms of services to the communities, disruption of traditional life, and environmental effects from open-pit mining and heavy-metal tailings. = Mica = Mica was discovered near Tranomaro in 1912, and can be found in crystalline schists from T√¥lanaro to Ihosy. There were 50 different companies mining mica in 1947, but demand fell in 1963. The biggest mine is at Ampandandrava, about from T√¥lanaro, which exported 1,000 tons of mica in 2010. Le Mica Madagascar Matin. (2011, Aout). SOMIDA ‚Äì Une production annuelle de 1 000 T de Mica. = Uranium ores = Uranothorianite is a rich and highly radioactive ore of uranium. It was discovered by French surveyors in Anosy in 1953, and considered of great importance by the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). The locals called the dense black rocks vatovy and used them as slingshot ammunition and fishing weights. The CEA established a mining centre at Ambatomika, digging small open-pit mines. Between 1954 and 1963, almost 4,000 tonnes of uranothorianite was mined and exported to France. By 1964 this was Madagascar's second-most valuable export. In 1963, the original Ambindandrakemba mine was exhausted, and the centre was moved north to Betioky, near the Belafa ore body which was thought to have between 2,000 and 5,000 tons of uranothorianite. Mining ended in 1968, due to the degradation of equipment and the discovery of larger deposits in Gabon and Niger. In 2005, the Malagasy government conducted aerial magnetic and radiometric surveys of the area, which found thorium and uranium deposits increased to the west. In 2007, drilling by the Canadian firm Pan African Mining Corporation found a site with \\"high-grade uranium mineralisation grading 4,329 ppm uranium\\", with deposits as deep as 60 metres. London-based Bekitoly Resources Ltd. acquired exploration rights which include eight of the historical open-pit deposits, and have conducted airborne radiometrics and hyperspectral surveys, ground radiometrics and magnetics, mapping, grab sampling, trenching and drilling. These activities identified numerous areas of interest, with uranium and thorium scintillometer readings of up to 26,257 and 43,215 ppm, respectively. They also discovered numerous rare-earth elements. Arkenstone. (2010). Thorianite specimen from Maromby Commune (near Tranomaro) Girschik, H.F. (2009, Oct.).

The ilmenite-mining operation also produces 25,000 tons zircon and 15,000 tons of rutile per year. It has the potential to increase production to 2 million tons of ilmenite per year, with an expected operational lifetime of 40 years. Almost $1 billion was spent developing this mine, including the new harbour at Port d'Ehola. Al Jazeera. (?). Rio Tinto Madagascar (YouTube) Al Jazeera. (2009, 10 March).

Tourism  Anosy has a high potential for tourism with its pleasant climate, sprawling beaches, and nature reserves with distinctive wildlife (several containing lemurs). T√¥lanaro has a variety of hotels and has promoted itself as the \\"Malagasy Riviera\\" (). As with other industries, tourism has been limited by a lack of infrastructure. Popular places to visit include Evatraha, Libanona beach, Lokaro, Manafiafy, Nahampoana and Vinanibe.Ranarijaona, Tiana H. (2003?).

Fort Dauphin. and T√¥lanaro.  History of Anosy  = Early history = The early history of Anosy is based primarily on archeological digs in the Efaho valley, just west of T√¥lanaro. These 11th‚Äì13th century sites on the coastal dunes were small ( in size) and seasonal or temporary, based on the need to move to find food. Activities focused on fishing, cultivation of tubers and hunting. Iron working was also present. Trade was limited to the northeast, along the coast, and formed a very simple economic and social system.Rakotoarlsoa, Jean-Aim√©. (1998). Mille ans d'occupation humaine dans le sud-est de Madagascar Anosy, Une √Æle au milieu des terres. Evidence suggests that between the 13th and 15th centuries, those living in Anosy were working chlorite schist which was exchanged through the trade network for Chinese greenware pottery. A Chinese nautical map from 1315 shows Madagascar's coastline, winds and currents. Settlements grew slightly, primarily located on the flood plains and coastal lagoons, with cultivation of sweet potatoes and further development of iron working. In the early 14th century, a Gujarat ship wrecked off the Anosy coast; it has been theorized that the stranded Gujarati went north to found the Zarabehava dynasty of Antesaka, though some scholars disagree.Kent, R.K. (1992). Madagascar and the islands of the Indian Ocean. In Ogot, B.A. (Ed.), General History of Africa-V: Africa from the Sixteenth to the Eighteenth century. Paris: UNESCO. = Zafiraminia dynasty = In the 16th century, the Zafiraminia (descendants of the Muslim Ramini) arrived in present-day Anosy and moved into the Efaho valley after being defeated by the Antambahoaka people to the north.Domenichini-Ramiaramanana, B. (1988). Madagascar. In M. Elfasi (Ed.), General history of Africa * III: Africa from the seventh to the eleventh century. Paris: UNESCO. The Zafiraminia had lived in Madagascar from about the 13th century and had assimilated into the Malagasy population; they did not have Islamic institutions though they retained Arabic script and several socio-religious practices. The Zafiraminia introduced the use of wooden huts, owning cattle as a sign of wealth, and established a dynasty that lasted 200 years. The Zafiraminia established a stratified society with elaborate rituals, aided by their literacy, which was viewed as a kind of magic.Kent, R.K. (1969). The Anteimoro: A theocracy in southeastern Madagascar. Journal of African History, X(I), 45‚Äì65.Lynda. (2010). ZafiRaminia. Their settlements were further inland, in size, and may have been fortified with ditches and wooden palisades. = European contact and Jesuit mission = While the Zafiraminia moved into Anosy from the north, Europeans began arriving from the south. On 10 August 1500, a Portuguese crew ‚Äì whose ship had been separated from the 2nd Portuguese India Armada during a storm ‚Äì became the first Europeans to see Madagascar, at the southern coast near present-day T√¥lanaro. They named it Ilha de S√£o Louren√ßo (\\"Saint-Laurent\\" in French). There were at least five shipwrecks on this coast between 1504 and 1507, and historian Mike Pearson believes some of the Portuguese survivors built the fort Tranovato (English: house of stone), a stone blockhouse located on a hill west of present-day T√¥lanaro. Others believe it was erected a generation later, but it is likely the first European building on Madagascar, and sheltered shipwrecked sailors awaiting rescue.Canitrot. (1921). Les Portugais sur la c√¥te orientale de Madagascar et en Anosy au XVIe si√®cle (1500-1613-1617). Revue Francaise d'Histoire d'Outre Mer, 04-06, 203‚Äì238. Other shipwrecked sailors were able to assimilate, possibly aided by being light-skinned like the ruling Zafiraminia who claimed to be descended from Arabs. On 4 August 1508, Diogo Lopes de Sequeira arrived on a Portuguese trade mission, recovering two shipwreck survivors who served as a Malagasy translators for contact and resupply. Trading colonies were attempted by the Portuguese and the French, but initial efforts were short-lived and abandoned. Shipwrecks continued and conditions at Anosy led cartographer Jean Parmentier to describe the waters as \\"the ocean without reason\\". In 1613, a Portuguese expedition to Madagascar visited the stone fort at Travovato, which was occupied by a local king, Chambanga.Ramerini, M. & Koster, D. (1998). A Portuguese fort in Madagascar: The fort near Tolanaro. A treaty of friendship was agreed, trade was opened, and a church was built for Jesuit missionaries to begin evangelism. A dispute broke out when the king apparently reneged on an agreement to send his son Drian-Ramaka to Goa for Catholic education; the sailors seized the boy by force and their ship was briefly attacked before sailing to Goa. In April 1616 the Jesuits returned to Anosy to exchange Drian-Ramaka for Chambanga's other sons, which the king refused; following accusations, and realizing their missionary work was in jeopardy, the Jesuits settled for a distant relation of the king. Chambanga became further distrustful when the Portuguese began prospecting for gold and silver; he suspended trade, attempting to starve them out of Anosy. This continued when Drian-Ramaka succeeded his father, and respected the folk religion instead of embracing Catholicism. Suffering in isolation and having baptized only one Malagasy person over a year, the Jesuits left Anosy in 1617.Cambou√©, P. (1910). Madagascar. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton. = Early French settlements = Beginning in 1604, French King Henry IV began sending ships to Madagascar to compete with the Dutch colonies at the Gold Coast of Africa. In 1642, Cardinal Richelieu sought possession of Madagascar for France, granting trading rights to Captain Rigault and associates who created the first French East India Company. A French settlement was established at Manafiafy in Anosy. There were many deaths in the first months, likely due to malaria and dysentery in the swampy area, and the settlement was moved southwest to the peninsula of Taolanara where they built what was later named Fort Dauphin, France's first colony in the Indian Ocean. The site was above sea level, and with a redoubt built across the peninsula was defensible from sea and land.Rochon, A. & Brunei, M.I. (1793). A voyage to Madagascar and the East Indies, pp. 64-65 The French found Dian Ramaka to be friendly; their settlement sites were at the edge of the Zafiraminia's world and did not cause an affront. Sieur Jacques de Pronis, the first governor of the French East India Company, married a Zafindraminia noblewoman. However, Pronis angered the colonists who put him in chains; following his rescue, the rebels ‚Äì both French and Malagasy ‚Äì were banished to R√©union Island. √âtienne de Flacourt took over as governor, and sought to establish several colonies in Madagascar to resupply European ships travelling to the Indies, obtaining food from the Malagasy through trade or by force, and selling indigo, tobacco and sugarcane to fund colonial expansion. By this time, rice and cattle had become the primary food sources. According to historian R. K. Kent, Anosy was one of the most-densely populated parts of Madagascar with considerable agricultural surpluses. The Malagasy traded for ceramics from China, England, France and Portugal. Successive governors of Fort Dauphin in the mid-17th century sought to conquer Anosy by wresting control from the Zafiraminia kings, who had united under Dian Ramack (and later, his son Andriampanolahy). Several military campaigns pillaged and burned villages, killed and enslaved Malagasy, and stole tens of thousands of cattle. The Malagasy made reprisals with massacres, poisonings, and captured and burned Fort Dauphin. During the same period, missionary work was conducted by the Lazarist Congregation of the Mission. In 1674, after the French East India Company had twice been reorganized due to poor profits, the rebuilt Fort Dauphin was evacuated and the colony abandoned. The colonial failure was a bitter experience for the French, who left behind as many as 4,000 French casualties, and was a source of political embarrassment for 200 years. = Feudal rule = Conflict continued in Anosy following the French evacuation. When shipwrecked pirates took shelter at Fort Dauphin in 1697, their leader, Abraham Samuel, a mulatto from Martinique, was installed as a king. Until his death in 1705, Samuel led pirate‚ÄìAnosy forces in constant warfare with Antanosy king Diamarang Diamera. The Zafiraminia also attempted to regain control, without success; they faced a number of revolts. The number and size of settlements shrank, and moved further inland. Frenchman arrived to rebuild Fort Dauphin as a supply base in 1768. He found that there were 35 rulers in Anosy, many of whom were at war with one another, and none of whom governed more than 3,000 people. He signed 30 treaties with local kings, making alliances by supplying them with muskets (over 10,000 muskets and 50 tons of gunpowder were sold). However, the French government abolished the French East India Company the following year, and Maudave's trading settlement was abandoned. At about the time of the French departure, the Zafiriminia kingdom also fell, having been ravaged by warfare since the mid-1600s. In 1819, the French again reopened Fort Dauphin, after negotiating with the Zafiraminia chief Rabefania. The chief sought French protection from the Imerina Kingdom which was seeking to conquer the whole of Madagascar. Fort Dauphin continued to export cattle, and also became a slaving base and operated a rum distillery. = Imerina control = An army of the Imerina Kingdom of central Madagascar, numbering 3,000‚Äì4,000 soldiers, moved down the coast of Anosy and took Fort Dauphin on 14 March 1825, at which point the Imerina Kingdom controlled the entire eastern coast of Madagascar. The fort was garrisoned by 800 Imerina troops armed with muskets which, along with garrisons at other coastal towns, controlled shipping trade. Most of Anosy, however, resisted the brutal treatment by the Imerina and was effectively self-ruled. The Imerina pursued a policy of isolationism and dismantled treaties with England and France. Successive Imerina monarchs were alternately influenced by the French and English. In 1869, Imerina Queen Ranavalona II converted to Christianity. A church was built at Fort Dauphin and attendance made mandatory. Evangelists from the London Missionary Society later took leadership of the church. = Franco-Malagasy Wars = France invaded Madagascar in 1883, to counter the growing British influence in the Indian Ocean. This first Madagascar expedition concerned itself mainly with the north of Madagascar, where Imerina power was centred. This created an opportunity for the Antanosy to revolt and seize Fort Dauphin, though the Imerina reclaimed it in 1884. In 1885, the fort was bombarded by a French warship and evacuated. In 1887‚Äì88, Norwegian missionary Nielsen-Lund described the Antanosy population as \\"very scattered\\" and ruled by 30 feudal kings, and that northern Anosy was a lawless place. A Lutheran church and school was established outside Fort Dauphin, but the support given by the Queen of Imerina caused the missionaries to be viewed as collaborators by the Antanosy. In the following years, additional churches were established at Evatraha, Mandromondromotry, and Mahatalaky. (1995). First Norwegian-American Missionaries, 3 of 3.

Doctoral Dissertation. Lutheran School of Theology, Chicago. In 1891, natural rubber was discovered in western Anosy, and within a year 1,680 tons were exported. The strategic importance of Madagascar had declined following the opening of the Suez Canal. Britain and France redefined their spheres of influence in Africa; Britain gained control of Zanzibar in return for recognizing Madagascar as a French protectorate. The French then launched the second Madagascar expedition in 1894. Again, the invaders concerned themselves mainly with the Imerina strongholds, and conquered north and central Madagascar in 1895. In Anosy, the Antandroy overran a number of European trading stations, forcing the foreigners out and plundering their stores. = French colony = Madagascar officially became a French colony on 6 August 1896, and French troops took control of Fort Dauphin. Europeans reported a great deal of insecurity elsewhere in southern Madagascar. The interior of Anosy was ruled by Antanosy king Rabefagnatrika, who was a rival of pro-French Manambaro king Rabefially. Southern Madagascar was conquered by the French in 1898, using counter-insurgency methods developed in Indochina. In 1897, the French governor reintroduced the Imerina labour tax, requiring every able-bodied male to provide 50 days of unpaid labour per year. Head taxes were also imposed, under penalty of forced labour, in efforts to increase agricultural production and tax revenues. Roads were built and plantations established for European companies and settlers. Many villages were relocated along the new highways. Activities of Roman Catholic and Lutheran missionaries increased. The harsh regime and disregard for Malagasy culture were met by a number of small revolts and raids, which culminated in a general uprising in 1904‚Äì1905. While the uprising was sparked in the north, the southeast had become fertile ground for revolution. Antanosy king king Befanatrika led rebels south into Anosy, and in December 1904 captured Esira, Fort Dauphin, and Manambaro, with widespread looting. While Protestants generally supported the uprising, Catholics opposed it and a number of Catholic churches were burned by the rebels. Following the revolt, the French closed the Lutheran schools and churches, believing them complicit. The region also suffered from smallpox and locusts during this time. In 1926‚Äì27, the head tax was almost doubled and a three-year conscription system instituted to provide more labour for colony construction projects. The government also continued to seize lands for these projects, plantations, and French settlers. During World War II, Madagascar was the site of a 1942 campaign between Allied and Vichy French forces. The fighting was concentrated in the north and central regions; the Vichy governor-general had retreated steadily southward, and surrendered rather than enter Anosy. These incidents and the British occupation further tarnished the prestige of the French colonial government. Nationalist and pro-independence sentiments strengthened following the return of men forced into conscription, the continuation of forced labour, and the absence of reforms promised by Charles de Gaulle. When the French government refused to support a democratic process toward Madagascar independence, militant independence leaders gained ground and initiated the Malagasy Uprising (1947‚Äì1949). The uprising began in the east and was immediately followed by the south where it enjoyed particularly strong support and attracted as many as one million peasants to fight. The southern rebels were led by Betsileo former-teacher Michel Radaoroson. His leadership was usurped in August 1947 by Lehoaha, whose insurgents were better armed. The intensity and cruelty of the French response was unprecedented in French colonial history, and military records of the conflict were classified. = Madagascar Republic = Madagascar gained independence by referendum in 1958. Political power of the new government was consolidated amongst the Imerina middle-class, and was challenged in 1971 by a peasant uprising in Toliara Province (which includes the present Anosy Region). Sisal production in Anosy peaked in 1964 but rapidly declined thereafter. Periwinkle plantations began, as did exports of seaweed to Japan and live lobsters to Europe. Student protests joined by a general strike and rioting led to a state of emergency, a military government frought with ethnic coups, and the 1975 establishment of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar. This second republic pursued socialist reforms with the aims of achieving rapid economic and cultural development. In the 1980s, the rapid growth of T√¥lanaro created deforestation in Anosy, which became a high-priority area for international conservation efforts. The World Wildlife Fund began working in Andohahela National Park. Meanwhile, QIT-Fer et Titane established an office in T√¥lanaro and began a joint venture to mine ilmenite. Politically weakened by the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the socialist regime transitioned to the Third Republic of Madagascar in 1992. Ecotourism in Anosy grew rapidly in the early and mid-1990s, but temporarily collapsed during 2007‚Äì2009 due to the complete booking of T√¥lanaro hotels for QMM employees and contractors. UK- based charity Azafady began poverty-relief efforts in southeast Madagascar in 1994. T√¥lanaro suffered a cholera outbreak in 2000‚Äì2001 and syphilis outbreak in 2007, the later resulting in a state of emergency. The World Bank named the town as one of three sites for its Integrated Growth Poles project.Madagascar economy: Fostering business recovery. (2005).

It was published in 1955 by Gnome Press in an edition of 4,000 copies. Sequels * Plague Ship (1956) * Voodoo Planet (1959) * Postmarked the Stars (1969) Plot Fresh out of Training Pool, a trade school for spaceship crews, Dane Thorson discovers that his first assignment as apprentice-Cargo Master puts him on Solar Queen, a Free Trader: basically an interstellar tramp freighter. At the end of Dane‚Äôs first flight the ship‚Äôs captain gains an opportunity to bid on a planet newly opened for possible trade and the crew goes all in to get the contract for a planet named Limbo. The information on the planet, which comes with the contract, does not look promising, but things look up a bit when a team of archaeologists hires Solar Queen to take them to Limbo. On Limbo the archaeologists set up camp in the ruins of a Forerunner town, a trace of the people who ran a galactic empire long before humans ventured into space and who had wiped themselves out in an interstellar war. Dane and four others go exploring, to try to find intelligent life and potential trade goods. One of the group, Ali Kamil, disappears, apparently kidnapped by people using alien technology. Spooked, a group including Dane goes to the ruins to check up on the archaeologists and finds that they have disappeared. Suspicion has them return to Solar Queen by an alternate route and they begin to find wrecked spaceships, some from thousands of years previous, that show signs of having been looted. Approaching their landing site, they find Solar Queen under siege by pirates and they discern that the archaeologists are part of the pirate gang. While watching their ship from cover, Dane and his companions capture a pirate and invade the pirates‚Äô underground base. There they find Forerunner technology still operating. In particular, they see two of the pirates operating a machine that draws in spaceships and crashes them on the planet. They also see signals indicating that one of the pirates‚Äô own ships is being pursued by a Stellar Patrol cruiser. Dane and his companions shut down the Forerunner base as the Patrol ship approaches and then try to fight their way out of the base. As the Solar Queens crew engages the pirates in a blaster battle, the Patrol comes in and rescues them, putting a complete end to the pirates‚Äô operation. The Patrol insists that Solar Queens crew give up their contract for Limbo, due to Forerunner artifacts, but they are allowed to take over the contract of one of the pirates‚Äô victims, for trade with a planet called Sargol.

Life He was born in New York City to Silas Weir Roosevelt, a son of Cornelius Roosevelt and Mary West. He was thus a cousin of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt did not take to either business or politics, the traditional Roosevelt family occupations. Instead, he was musically and mechanically inclined and wanted to be an organ builder from early childhood, entering an apprenticeship at an organ factory. He later traveled to Europe for further training in the field. His relatives frowned upon a mechanical occupation, but when he began to make money, his family was reassured. Roosevelt was particularly interested in the electric action organ, and was one of the first to study the application of new electrical devices to the manufacture of organ actions. He took out the first patent in the United States for an electric action for the pipe organ when he was 20, and built the first electric action organ in the United States for the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. Though primarily interested in the technical aspects, he had a good deal of business acumen as well, establishing factories in New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Hilborne founded the Roosevelt Pipe Organ Builders in 1870 with his brother Frank and built some of the largest organs in the United States during his career. Roosevelt was also widely known among electricians for inventing several details of the telephone including the automatic switch-hook, for which he received royalties for many years, and held an interest in the Bell Telephone Company. Personal life Roosevelt married Katherine Shippen on February 1, 1883, and had one child, Dorothy Quincy Roosevelt (born 1884). He died at his home in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan at the age of 37 on December 30, 1886.

It was situated in the village of S√∂flingen, now part of Ulm in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. Being the oldest nunnery of this order in Germany, it was also its most important and most affluent.  Foundation  S√∂flingen Abbey originated from a pre-Franciscan congregation of women that had acquired the rights over three farmsteads close to the river Danube near Ulm. It was for the first time mentioned in 1237. Soon the original location became inadequate being too small to house a growing number of nuns. Its exposed position close to the river Danube also meant that it was vulnerable during the political upheaval in the reign of Emperor Frederick II and before 1253 a decision was made to move the congregation to S√∂flingen. In 1254 and in 1259 Hailwigis (Hedwig) was mentioned as being the first abbess. At the same time, in 1252, nuns from S√∂flingen and Ulm were sent out to found a new convent at Pfullingen (also near Ulm). The relocation to S√∂flingen was actively assisted by Countess Willibirgis of Helfenstein, a member of the noble family of Dillingen by birth, and finally confirmed when, on 13 January 1258, Hartmann IV, Count of Dillingen, signed a charter donating lands at Sevelingen, previously owned by the counts of Dillingen, to the nuns in order to found a monastery there.K.S. Frank, Das Klarissenkloster S√∂flingen bis zur Aufhebung 1803, p. 165  Development  After initially accepting the rule for the Second Order of St Francis of Assisi as laid down by Pope Gregory IX, the nuns accepted the amendments by Pope Innocent IV only to finally follow the rules as promulgated by Pope Urban IV (1261‚Äì64). When exactly this happened is not known. However, the monastery followed this rule in the 14th century. From its very beginning, S√∂flingen Abbey was under the ecclesiastical protection of the Papal See. This was confirmed several times by privileges issued by Innocent IV and Alexander IV (1254‚Äì61). The latter also relieved them from the duty to pay taxes to the papacy due to the nuns' oath of poverty. Pope Nicholas III (1277‚Äì80) widened this protection to include all the subjects and all the possessions of S√∂flingen Abbey. Finally, Pope John XXII (1316‚Äì34) explicitly appointed the Bishop of Constance as the official protector of the nunnery. The task of secular protection passed at first from the Emperor Conrad IV to the Counts of Dillingen. In 1356, however, Emperor Charles IV put the abbey under the secular protection of the Free Imperial City of Ulm but confirmed many of its rights in 1368, especially the rights of advocacy. During the Middle Ages the monastery not only owned possessions in the vicinity of S√∂flingen and Ulm but also had ownership over numerous villages stretching as far as Gomaringen near T√ºbingen and, transcending the boundaries of the Diocese of Constance, even into the Diocese of Augsburg. Since 1239 S√∂flingen Abbey owned vineyards in Neuffen and later acquired vineyards in Heimbach, Beutelsbach, Gro√üheppach, Schnait (all near Weinstadt) and Stuttgart. With the acquisition of the local fortress, a process began which culminated in the whole village of S√∂flingen coming into the possession of the abbey around 1270. In 1392 S√∂flingen Abbey issued a set of laws for the village of S√∂flingen, an indication of how the idea of rule was changing, away from mere authority of a restricted, local area and towards authority over a wider range of territory. In the 15th century, an echo of the mysticism of the 13th and 14th century became to characterise the spiritual life of the monastery as witnessed by the S√∂flinger Briefe and the S√∂flinger Lieder. These letters and songs document an increasing tendency towards spiritualisation and a more poetic approach of piety. A further expression of this change is the reform of the abbey which was completed with the replacement of Abbess Christina Str√∂lin (1469‚Äì84) by the reform-oriented Abbess Elisabeth Reichner (1484‚Äì1508/13) and the rebuilding of the abbey under the latter when not only the ecclesiastical buildings were either rebuilt or renewed but also had a wall surrounding the monastery added. During the Protestant Reformation S√∂flingen Abbey came into conflict with the Imperial City of Ulm which had accepted Protestantism in 1529. The abbey endeavoured to defend Catholicism and to preserve its political independence. The nuns were supported by Emperor Charles V who repeatedly prohibited Ulm to abuse its right of protection over the abbey. At the same time the emperor appointed the Bishops of Augsburg and Constance as ecclesiastical protectors. Ulm's city council, on the other hand, forbade its citizens to attend mass at the abbey. In 1537 Ulm unsuccessfully tried to install a Protestant priest in S√∂flingen and to introduce Protestantism between 1543 and 1548. From this time on, S√∂flingen Abbey attempted to discard Ulm's protection and claimed Imperial immediacy, which they achieved only much later, and kept repelling Protestant influences. In 1566 and 1576 abbey was given a seat at the Imperial Diet. During the Thirty Years War, the abbey suffered from the armies of the Protestant Union as well as those from the Catholic League. In 1628, Swedish troops pillaged the abbey and from 1643 until 1647 Swedish troops used the abbey as a permanent base. During these years, the nuns from the abbey sought refuge behind the protective walls of Ulm. S√∂flingen Abbey was to be used as headquarters for troops again in the 18th century during the War of the Spanish Succession, this time by Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, in 1701 and in 1704 by the Duke of Marlborough. During the Napoleonic Wars, Michel Ney set up his headquarters at the abbey in 1805. After the end of the Thirty Years War in 1648 it took some decades before the general recovery made itself felt at S√∂flingen Abbey. Under the rule of abbesses Euphrosinia Rampf (1684‚Äì1687), Kleopha Veeser (1687) and Angela Gr√§fin Slawata (1687‚Äì1701) the abbey church was rebuilt in early Baroque style. The building was designed and erected under the supervision of architect Kaspar Feichtmayr from Wessobrunn. In the 18th century S√∂flingen Abbey owned the villages of S√∂flingen, Harthausen and Schaffelkingen (now all part of the city of Ulm) as well as parts of the villages of Bettingen, Burlafingen and Eckingen. In several other villages mostly belonging to the Imperial City of Ulm, the abbey had the right to levy certain taxes and was in possession of estates there. In 1773 the abbey reached a legal settlement with the city of Ulm whereby it relinquished its rights on the villages of M√§hringen, Lehr, Jungingen, Breitingen, Holzkirch, Lonsee, Langenau, Weidenstetten, S√∂glingen and Bermaringen. In exchange for this Ulm, which had been Protestant since the first half of the 16th century, gave up its protection, territorial and legal rights over S√∂flingen Abbey. At the same time, the abbey finally achieved Imperial immediacy with the abbess receiving a seat and voting rights in the Swabian Circle and the Reichstag.  Dissolution  Following the secularisation of ecclesiastical states the territory and property of S√∂flingen Abbey with its 4000 subjects came under Bavarian rule in 1803. Together with the nuns the last abbess, Bonaventura Seelinger, chose to continue the monastic life but was ejected from the monastery in 1809 when the buildings were used as an army hospital and later as a Royal Bavarian court of law only to be allowed to briefly return in 1810 when, following a border treaty between W√ºrttemberg and Bavaria in 1810, the area around S√∂flingen, together with Ulm, came under the rule of the recently founded Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. Monastic life came to an end in 1814 when the buildings were again used as a hospital, this time for the W√ºrttemberg army. The abbey's possessions were largely sold off into private hands. Most of the monastic buildings were demolished and the abbey church became the parish church of S√∂flingen.

He was the only son of Denis Cloney, a prosperous middleman, of Moneyhore, Wexford, and his wife, Mary Kavanagh (d. 1782), a native of Ballybeg, County Carlow, both Roman Catholics. Thomas Cloney also had three sisters. Rebel A United Irishman, as a young man Cloney was appointed a Colonel in the United ranks shortly before the outbreak of the 1798 rebellion. During the Wexford Rebellion he fought at the battles of Three Rocks, New Ross, Foulksmills/Goff's Bridge and led the attack on Borris House. He was often subsequently referred to as \\"General Cloney\\". Following the failure of the rebellion, Cloney was imprisoned at Wexford and, briefly, at the notorious Geneva Barracks and was condemned to death. This sentence was later commuted to banishment for life to the Penal Colony of New South Wales. Later, after spending twenty-one months in gaol, he was released on condition that he leave Ireland for two years. Most of that time he spent in Liverpool. (T. Cloney, A narrative of those transactions in the county of Wexford in which the Author was engaged in the awful year of 1798,(Dublin)1832). On his return to Ireland in May 1803 Cloney immediately involved himself with Robert Emmet and his associates. In Byrnes's Memoirs, he describes a meeting he arranged between Robert Emmet and Cloney at Harold's Cross Green, Dublin shortly before Emmet's uprising. Circumstantial evidence would suggest that Emmet had appointed Cloney to act as his General for County Wexford, had the anticipated success of the rising in Dublin come about.Joyce, p. 43. Following the collapse of Emmett's rising, Cloney was again arrested and lodged in Dublin Castle and later in Kilmainham Gaol from where he was released on health grounds in November 1804. After his release, Cloney went to live at Graiguenamanagh, County Kilkenny, where his home was nicknamed \\"Whitehall\\". Of the principal leaders of the 1798 rebellion, he, along with Joseph Holt was only one of two rebel leaders to survive and remain in Ireland. Historian Cloney wrote a history of the 1798 Rebellion which was one of the first written from the perspective of the defeated rebels. \\"A Personal Narrative of those Transactions in the County of Wexford, in which the author was engaged, during the awful period of 1798.\\". It contains an Appendix which includes a report of Cloney's trial by Court Martial which began on 5 July 1799. He had wished to publish his book earlier but was advised against it by his attorney, Peter Burrowes. Personal life Cloney continued his involvement in political affairs, becoming one of the most active and enthusiastic supporters of Daniel O'Connell in his efforts to secure Catholic Emancipation and Repeal of the Union. Cloney was visited at his home at \\"Whitehall\\" by many prominent Irish figures of the period, including Father Theobald Mathew, Daniel O'Connell and Archibald Hamilton Rowan.Joyce, p. 54. In 1848, he was visited there by William Smith O'Brien, Thomas Francis Meagher and John Blake Dillon, just prior to the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848.Joyce, p. 55. In 1849, Charles Gavan Duffy visited him. Cloney never married but played a prominent role in the parochial and political life of Graiguenamanagh and lived there for the remainder of his life. He died on 20 February 1850, aged 76 or 77, and was interred at St Mullin's Cemetery, County Carlow, where a large tombstone marks his final resting place, overlooking the River Barrow.His grave is located near the rear of the cemetery (if one enters by the main gate) - among the ruined ecclesiastical buildings - near the river.

Related activities such as soliciting and procuring are prohibited. UNAIDS estimate there are 9,285 prostitutes in the capital, Lusaka. Many women turn to prostitution due to poverty. Sex workers report law enforcement is corrupt, inconsistent and often abusive. In Lusaka, some prostitutes enrol in colleges to obtain a campus room to work from. Zambia has a huge problem relating to child prostitution. There is a mistaken belief that having intercourse with a virgin will cure AIDS. HIV and sex trafficking are also problems in the country. History Prior to the arrival of the Europeans, prostitution occurred along the long-distance trade routes, especially around the rest houses. From 1850, the number of Europeans settling in Zambia increased greatly. Most were single men who employed 'Cook Boys‚Äô as servants. Part of the duties of the 'Cook Boys‚Äô was to procure prostitutes for their employers. The woman became known as 'Cook Women‚Äô. Starting from in the 1900s, many men moved from the rural areas to the emerging industrial areas to find work. Some worked in the tin and lead mines at Kabwe, others worked on the construction of the Livingstone to Katanga railway. These men. living away from their wives, created a demand for prostitution in these areas. In Lusaka, prostitutes set up settlements alongside the worker's residential areas. In the 1920s and 1930s, large scale mining in the Copperbelt was established. The mine workers created a huge demand for prostitution. The prostitutes also cooked and washed for the miners and were known as 'comfort women'. By 1930, STIs were highly prevalent amongst migrant workers. The Native Authorities expelled all unmarried women from migrant worker's camps in the Copperbelt. The Colonial Government set up blockades at bus stops and transit routes in 1939 in an attempt to stop the prostitutes travelling to the areas men were working in. As a result, brothels started to appear along the migrant labour routes, these routes becoming known as 'whores‚Äô tracks'. Thee Mulobezi ‚Äì Mongu trail in the Western Province was particularly known for its brothels. Following Zambia's win over Ghana in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations's semi-final, many prostitutes offered supporters free sex as part of the celebrations. HIV HIV is a major problem in Zambia, with the 7th highest prevalence in the world. Sex workers are a high risk group. Condom use is low, partly due to a belief that circumcised men can't spread the infection. UNAIDS estimate HIV prevalence amongst sex workers to be 56.4% Sex trafficking Zambia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. While orphans and street children are most vulnerable, children of affluent village families are also at risk of trafficking because sending children to the city for work is perceived to confer status. Zambian boys and girls are exploited in sex trafficking by truck drivers in towns along the Zimbabwean and Tanzanian borders and by miners in Solwezi. Zambian boys are subjected to sex trafficking in Zimbabwe and women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in South Africa. Domestically, extended families and trusted family acquaintances facilitate trafficking. Women and children from neighboring countries are exploited in sex trafficking in Zambia. Chinese traffickers bring in Chinese women and girls for sexual exploitation in brothels and massage parlors in Lusaka; traffickers use front companies posing as travel agencies to lure Chinese victims and coordinate with Zambian facilitators and middlemen. Potential trafficking victims from Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Syria were identified in Zambia. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Zambia as a 'Tier 2' country.

Early life and education Thomas Davis was born at Havre des Pas, St Helier, Jersey on 25 April 1867, the son of Thomas Leopold Davis, a fisherman and ship's carpenter, and Jemima Vickers. The Davis family lived at Havre des Pas which in the 1860s had a strong boat building industry. Davis was educated at St Luke's Elementary School. His parents struggled to get the twopence a week they had to pay as a contribution to his education. Davis did not go on to higher education but instead went to sea as a ship's boy aged 15 on the vessel Satellite, a 245-ton three masted schooner owned by R & George Allix of Havre des Pas, Jersey but registered in Guernsey. Seafaring On his first voyage, the ship grounded in heavy weather on the Haisborough Sands just off the coast of Norfolk. In an attempt to save the ship's papers and valuables Thomas Davis was put into the ship's skiff but the painter broke and he was carried away from the vessel. Alone and drifting he was able to stay afloat by constantly bailing. Meanwhile, the Satellite was eventually refloated and returned to Southampton with the news that Davis was missing presumed drowned. He was saved when he was picked up some 19 to 36 hours later by a small Norwegian schooner, the Urda from Stavanger, who took him to the Isle of Wight. Once ashore in England he made his way to Southampton and the captain of the Channel Islands' mailboat took him back to Jersey. He arrived just as his family were leaving to attend his memorial service at St Luke's Church where he had been a member of the choir. It is reported that his mother fainted from the shock. Davis continued with his seagoing career sailing as a seaman around the world and obtaining his Extra Master's ticket at the unusually young age of 25. He served in the Royal Naval Reserve between 1896 and 1899 and taught gunnery on The President. Fortune In 1899 aged 32 Davis moved to South Africa, firstly to East London where he took up a stevedoring post. He then moved to Port Elizabeth and finally settled in Durban taking over Brock and Company Stevedores. This formed the basis of his wealth as eventually he controlled all of the stevedoring business from Port Elizabeth to Dar-es-Salaam. He developed harbour installations in Durban and elsewhere in South Africa and ran at least one trading vessel the Modwena. She had been the private yacht of the sewing machine magnate Mortimer Singer but under the ownership of Davis was used for trading between Durban and Madagascar. Within 10 years of settling in South Africa Davis had made his fortune. Yacht racing Davis continued to be interested in sailing after making his fortune. He owned several racing yachts, the most famous of which was the schooner Westward. Westward was built between 1909 and 1910 by Nathanael Herreshoff of the Herreschoff Manufacturing Company of Rhode Island for the New York industrialist Alexander Smith Cochran. She was constructed with an all-steel hull of LWL , designed and built for speed. She was purchased soon after completion by a syndicate of German businessmen who renamed her Hamburg. She was sold back into American ownership after the Great War and resumed her original name. Davis acquired her in 1924. Between 1925 and 1935, Davis raced the Westward in British and European waters against renowned opponents such as Sir Thomas J. Lipton's 23mR Shamrock (1908) and George V of the United Kingdom's HMY Britannia I (1893). The Westward was a familiar entry for Cowes Week during this time. Over the years Davis and King George V developed a fierce though friendly rivalry. In 1936, following the death of the King, Davis more or less gave up racing. He had a motor fitted in Westward and used her for cruising. Westward was laid up in Dartmouth for the duration of the Second World War. She was offered to three training schools after the war but no one could afford to repair and maintain her. When no suitable owner could be found for his beloved Westward, in accordance with his wishes, she was scuttled in the Hurd Deep in the English Channel, at a memorial service on 15 July 1947. Philanthropy Throughout his life Davis maintained links back to Jersey. He was a Patron of the St Helier Yacht Club and served as the Commodore of the Royal Channel Islands Yacht Club between 1937 and 1939. He also gave numerous gifts to the Island. During the First World War Davis remained in South Africa but his younger son, Howard Leopold Davis, served with the Highland Light Infantry. Howard was wounded at the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and died of his wounds on 12 August 1916. He is buried at Etaples Cemetery, France. Howard's death prompted Davis into philanthropy. =Howard Davis Farm= In 1927 Davis bought a property known as Parkfield near Trinity Church in Jersey. In November 1927 the States of Jersey accepted this property consisting of a house, farm buildings and some 40 verg√©es of land. A Deed of Covenant stated that the bequest was made on the understanding that it be renamed the Howard Davis Farm and that it should be used as an experimental center for the development and study of agriculture and for the instruction in this science of young Jersey people and other interested parties. In 2006 the States of Jersey consulted with the descendants of Thomas Davis and considered a partial abrogation of the covenant to regularise the uses of the site and to bring the covenant up to date. Today the farm houses the Jersey Agricultural Department's Headquarters and the Jersey Milk Marketing Board. =Howard College, Durban= Davis founded and endowed the Durban campus of the University of Natal. In 1926 he donated ¬£140,000 for the building and the Town Council of Durban donated of land in the Stella Bush. Howard College was officially opened in 1931 by Earl Clarendon, Governor General of the Union of South Africa. The College began by holding classes in Commerce and Engineering. Howard College remains a campus of the University of KwaZulu-Natal. =Howard Davis Challenge Cup= In 1935 Davis presented the Howard Davis Challenge Cup which is now in the collection of the National Maritime Museum, UK. Prior to World War One Howard Davis had been a cadet of the training ship Worcester. The cup was for a competition between the Cadets serving on the Training Ships Worcester, Conway and General Botha. The race was to be in cutters of twelve oars with the winners to retain the Cup. The first and only race was held in London in 1935 and was won by Worcester with the General Botha coming second. =Howard Hall= Howard Hall Davis had set up the Howard Leopold Davis scholarship trust in Jersey. One of this educational trust's provisions was that it should benefit boys who, like he, had attended an elementary school. The majority of boys benefiting from this trust went to Victoria College, Jersey and a number went up to Cambridge or Oxford. In 1934 Davis decided he wanted his old friend from his St Luke's elementary school days, John St Helier Lander, the portrait painter, to paint a portrait of King George V, to commemorate the endowment of the scholarship. When the commission was complete the artist and Davis visited the College to discuss where the portrait might be hung. When Davis discovered there was no room remaining in the College's great hall he decided to build another hall for the school. On 18 October 1934 Davis and his wife laid the foundation stone to Howard Hall, now known as Howard Davis Theatre. It was built of granite from Ouaisn√© and matched the gothic style of the older Victoria College buildings. Inside there was seating for 238, almost exactly the number of boys at school when the building was opened. The panelling and woodwork were of teak, and the clock an exact replica of that at the Greenwich Observatory. On 23 July 1935 the Prince of Wales came to Jersey to open the Hall and unveil the portrait of King George V. Davis requested four additional copies of the portrait from John St Helier Lander. These were given to the Howard College in Durban, Canada House, Australia House (now listed as hung in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia) and New Zealand House (now in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa). The artist, John St Helier Lander, took pride in the fact that all five of these portraits of the King had been \\"unveiled by Royal Princes, an honour no portrait painter has ever had before\\". =Howard Davis Park= Originally named Plaisance, this estate included a huge mansion surrounded by of grounds and was the home of Sir Bertram Falle. It was put on the market in 1937 for the sum of ¬£25,000. At the time Davis was seeking a suitable site to erect a statue of King George V. He purchased the site and employed Mr. J. A. Colledge, a famous landscape gardener, to lay out the grounds in the form of a park. Early in 1938 the landscaping of the park began. By August 1939 the work was so well advanced it was decided to prepare everything for an early public opening of the Park. The Park was officially handed over as a gift to the people of Jersey in September 1939. A statue of King George V by William Reid Dick was erected within the main entrance and the flagstaff was made from the spinnaker boom of Davis's racing yacht Westward. A Hall of Remembrance was also established in the grounds. Within weeks of being handed over, the Second World War was declared and German forces subsequently occupied the island. Despite this, the statue of King George V and the park itself came through the five long years of Occupation virtually unscathed. During the war years the area was used for the cultivation of vegetables for the needy of the island. Many of the trees within the Park were felled so as to provide firewood for cooking and heating. The Howard Davis Hall, as it is known today, was the original billiards room of the Plaisance property. Hanging in the hall are paintings of Howard Leopald Davis, Thomas Davis, his wife, and his sister as well as a painting of the famous yacht Westward in full sail. =Charity work= Davis also purchased a Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboat for the cost of ¬£3,623. It was named the Howard D as was the first motorised lifeboat to be stationed at St Helier, Jersey. She arrived at the St Helier station in August 1936. Davis continued with acts of philanthropy throughout his life. During the Second World War Davis established a fund of ¬£100,000 to help dependents of South Africans serving in the forces. =General Botha Memorial Training Ship= In 1920 Davis purchased , an obsolete ex-Royal Navy sailing cruiser of 4,050 tons that had been used as a submarine depot ship and repair workshop on the River Medway. Davis donated it in memory of his son to the Union of South Africa Defence Force for use as a training ship for cadets. The ship was renamed General Botha Memorial Training Ship and was christened by Mrs Issie Smuts, wife of the Prime Minister, on 1 April 1922. It was the first training ship in the Southern hemisphere. Davis stipulated that the ship be used for the full- time training of boys of British South Africa. His aim was to give the boys the opportunity to receive character building and nautical training of the highest standard so they might serve in ships sailing under flags of Great Britain and the British Empire. Death He died in October 1942, in Durban, at the age of 75. He left one son, Glenham, and 2 daughters, Marguerite and Minnie.

The book was published on 2 August 2007 by Doubleday Publishing and is set in a world where the Norse gods still survive as outlaws, their powers diminished, while a new and more powerful religion, the Order, tries to wipe out magic from the world. Harris has stated that she was inspired to write the book due to her love of Norse mythology as a child, with the book being loosely based on a novel she wrote in her late teens. The book was followed up with a 2011 sequel entitled Runelight.  Description  Runemarks follows Maddy, a young loner who has been ostracised from her town for the rust-coloured rune mark she carries on her left hand. Animals born with a rune mark on their bodies are seen as cursed or deformed and are usually quickly slaughtered. Maddy is allowed to live because she is human, but is always viewed with suspicion despite this. Her village does not follow the Norse Gods, as the puritanical regime known as the Order has mandated that no one is to speak or acknowledge any of the old ways, let alone use magic. It is only after she helps rid the local inn's cellar of goblins that Maddy discovers her latent magic, with it quickly becoming something that is occasionally useful to herself and those around her. As the book progresses Maddy flashes back to her childhood where she learned about runes and Norse legends through the old traveller One-Eye, who later reveals himself to Maddy as Odin and involves her in a quest to find a treasure buried beneath Red Horse Hill. As they search, they come across several other Norse gods and are led into a confrontation with the Order and their leader. Characters *Maddy Smith: A troubled, defiant, lonely child who will not go to church and is described by others as \\"imaginative\\", which is thought almost as bad as \\"giving herself airs\\". Her father does not love her, believing her birth to have caused her mother's death. She is considered ugly, made worse by the fact that her sister is both popular and very pretty. She has no friends and seeks refuge in stories and things of the imagination, all of which are viewed as dangerous by the society in which she lives. *Odin/One-Eye/the General: A traveller who educates Maddy in the use of the runes, and eventually turns out to be the leader of the gods in disguise. He is wily, sometimes unscrupulous, occasionally manipulative. He befriends Maddy and helps her, but also plans to use her for his own ends. Weakened after the End of the Worlds, he has lost most of his powers, but still has ambitions to rebuild his empire. *Loki, the Trickster: Half-demon, half-god, escaped by devious means from the Fortress of Netherworld. Charming, dishonest and unscrupulous; a villain who ends up being a very reluctant hero. *Skadi: Huntress and goddess of hunting. Hates Loki. *Freyja: Goddess of Desire. Vain and shallow. Hates Loki. *Heimdall: watchman of the gods. Hates Loki most of all. *Sugar-and-Sack: A goblin and a reluctant hero, enlisted by Maddy. *Adam Scattergood: a boy in Maddy's village. A bully, the son of the local innkeeper and Maddy's principal tormentor. Reception Critical reception for Runemarks has been mostly positive. The Guardian praised the novel, stating it \\"has a narrative nonchalance which just about evens out its ponderous infrastructure.\\" The SF Gate wrote that Runemarks \\"comes up short in terms of thematic rigor and depth of imagination\\" but that it also \\"delivers an adventure that will please a wide array of readers\\".

Arrested and deported to the USSR after the occupation of Latvia, imprisoned in Moscow's Lefortovo Prison. On 30 July 1941 shot and buried in the mass graves of Kommunarka shooting ground. Hugo Celmi≈Ü≈° was one of those who developed agrarian reform in Latvia. Early life Hugo Celmi≈Ü≈° was born on 30 October 1877 in the LubƒÅna parish as the youngest son in the family. H. Celmi≈Ü≈° studied from 1887 to 1891 at LubƒÅnas Ministry School, then at the Gorku School of Agriculture. In 1898, after his military service, he was seen in reserve as an officer. Entered the Polytechnic Institute of Riga in 1899, completed in 1903 with a first-class agronome degree. In 1900 was one of the founders of the Talavija student corporation. Then worked as an agronomist and teacher in Russia. In 1913 and 1914, while studying at the University of Bern, Switzerland, developed a doctoral thesis but failed to defend since the war began and had to go to the front. In June 1919, he volunteered for the JƒÅ≈Üa Balo≈æa brigade, fought against Bermondt, earning the rank of captain's service and the Order of LƒÅƒçplƒìsis.  Prime Minister  = First Term = The eighth Latvian government, led by VoldemƒÅrs ZƒÅmuels, resigned on 2 December 1924. The President of Latvia JƒÅnis ƒåakste nominated the politician who was known as the compiler and leader of the new cabinet, the member of the Latvian Farmers‚Äô Union, Hugo Celmi≈Ü≈°. The new government was formed on 16 December 1924. In the Hugo Celmi≈Ü≈° government declaration, national protection was raised as one of the top priorities. The statements made in declaration also reflected in the works: the army's numerical composition and military spending increased significantly (by 50%). The government's objectives in economic policy focused on establishing a balanced state budget and on supporting producers in the form of favourable credit conditions. The main economic objective was the increase in exports and the decline in imports. Agriculture was identified as the primary economic sector of Latvia. In the social field, the government of H. Celmi≈Ü≈° set out its goal to combat the cost of living by supporting the poor. In the foreign policy, Hugo Celmi≈Ü≈° government devoted great value to strengthening relations between Latvia and Estonia. The main objective of foreign policy was the establishment of the union of Baltic States. In parallel, the Latvian government took care of strengthening economic relations with neighbouring countries: a trade agreement with Lithuania, economic relations with the Soviet Union, trade conventions with France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, etc.. = Second Term = The second cabinet of Hugo Celmi≈Ü≈° was drawn up immediately after the third Saeima elections. The government commenced its activities on 1 December 1928. In the floods of 1928, 42% of all arable land in Latvia had suffered. Bad harvest had a negative impact on the overall economic situation in the country. The number of unemployed people increased and the number of livestock decreased significantly. To overcome the economic crisis, the government of Hugo Celmi≈Ü≈° offered to cut government budget spending, providing income through loans rather than raising taxes. One of the government's goals was to increase agricultural productivity and profitability. Farmers received special subsidies from the state budget, and the state ensured that prices for agricultural products were increased artificial domestically. To overcome the agricultural crisis cheap loans and different benefits for farms were accepted too. In internal policy, the government committed itself to ensure peace and order within the country and strict guarding of Latvia's borders. The emphasis was also placed on the establishment of a well-trained and patriotic army. Foreign policy, like in his first term, was aimed to develop closer cooperation between the Baltic states and to play an active role in the League of Nations. After the loss of the post of Prime Minister, Hugo Celmi≈Ü≈° was elected the Head of the City of Riga on April 23, 1931. At that time, several important objects were built in Riga - the Freedom Monument, the Brothers' Cemetery, Rai≈Üa graves.

Mascot lawsuit In 1999, the Salmon School Board was threatened by the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and the Media with a $100,000 lawsuit if they did not change the schools mascot, the Savages. Members of the coalition stated that Native American mascots were derogatory especially since the name was Savages. After discussions with the board, the group decided to focus only on changing the mascot. The school board ultimately chose to get rid of the logo featuring a Native American because it would cost more than $100,000 to fight the issue in court while maintaining the mascot name.

The small town and the castle are chiefly known for the Battle of Austerlitz. History A first castle at the site was erected by the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century, then the seat of a commandry within their Bohemian bailiwick. In the early 16th century it passed to the Moravian noble house of Kaunitz (Kounicov√©) who had it rebuilt in a Renaissance style. The present-day palace with 115 rooms was erected from 1696 onwards according to plans designed by the Italian architect Domenico Martinelli. The conversion was finished under Prince Wenzel Anton of Kaunitz-Rietberg more than fifty years later. Wenzel Anton hired the painter Joseph Pichler to apply frescoes in the chapel and the ceremonial hall of the castle. The impressive garden in a French style modelled on the Gardens of Versailles was laid out in 1774. In the oval ceremonial hall (the \\"Historic Salon\\"), an armistice was signed between Austria and France after the Battle of Austerlitz on 6 December 1805. There is a small historic museum and a multimedia presentation about the battle.Wilkinson, Don (2009).

Emo is a style of rock music characterized by melodic musicianship and expressive, often confessional lyrics. It originated in the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as \\"emotional hardcore\\" or \\"emocore\\" and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace. As the style was echoed by contemporary American punk rock bands, its sound and meaning shifted and changed, blending with pop punk and indie rock and encapsulated in the early 1990s by groups such as Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate. By the mid-1990s numerous emo acts had emerged from the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the style. Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the sales success of Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional, with the genre's popularity continuing in the 2000s with bands such as My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, and the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus.

The Shyness clinic adored the Scottish noisemakers Mogwai, and emo mix tapes often included the Ivy League folk of New York city's Ida.

After graduating from Vilkene Primary School and Kharkiv Agricultural High School, he studied agronomy in Norway, and also improved his knowledge of fish farming in Germany. In Russia, he worked as the director of the School of Agriculture and Fish Farming, as well as the manager of manors. After returning to Latvia, he started leading courses at the Riga Central Agricultural Association, and he founded and managed animal monitoring associations in the R≈´jiena and Valmiera areas. After the February Revolution in 1917, Alberings began to be involved in politics. In August, 1918, he was elected a member of the Vidzeme Land Council. In November, as a representative of the Latvian Farmers Union, he became a member of the People's Council of Latvia.

In September, Alberings also took over the duties of the Minister of Finance due to the resignation of the former Minister JƒÅnis Blumbers. In December, the Saeima asked Prime Minister Alberings why no new Minister of Finance had been found, to which he replied that he had assumed the post of Minister of Finance instead of performing his duties. The majority of Parliament found this explanation unsatisfactory and the government resigned. Since the autumn semester of 1926, he has been an honorary philistine of the student association \\"Fraternitas Rusticana\\".  Death  Artur Alberings died in Riga on April 26, 1934, from pneumonia.

History =Grammar school= The school was formed from Bridlington School (a grammar school founded on the site 20 September 1899, although founded in 1447 by King Henry VI) on Bessingby Road and Bridlington High School for Girls (founded in 1905) on St John's Street. The girls' school was opened on 26 September 1905 by Beilby Lawley, 3rd Baron Wenlock; it cost ¬£3,500. In November 1938, 13-year-old Tom Elliott of Weaverthorpe died at the school when a small splinter of bone in a playground accident punctured a main artery. The school had around 550 boys in the 1950s and 1960s with a boarding school. The girls' school also had a boarding house. The girls' school had around 550 girls. =Comprehensive= In 1975 the LEA (one year after Humberside County Council was formed with its base in Beverley) changed the school to a comprehensive. The high school site became Bridlington Lower School and the current site was the Upper School. Most of the lower school site has become a housing estate, although the main building, visible from Quay Road, has been preserved and converted into flats. When a comprehensive it still had its girls' and boys' boarding house until the 1990s. It no longer has a boarding house. School motto The school motto is ‚ÄúVitai Lampada Tradunt,‚Äù taken from the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius' De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of the Universe ‚Äì Book II, Line 79), and directly translates as \\"They Hand on the Torch of Life.\\" The motto is shared with that of Sydney Church of England Grammar School, North Sydney, Australia.

Born in New York, Pagano is the son of Joseph Pagano, a soldier in the Genovese family. In 1973, the New York Police Department (NYPD) arrested Daniel Pagano for selling narcotics to undercover officers. During the arrest, Pagano was shot in the back by police while leaning against a police car.\\"Police Shoot Narcotics Suspect, Son of Reputed Genovese Aide; $2,500 Paid\\" By EDWARD HUDSON New York Times March 25, 1973 Meeting with Sharpton In the early 1980s, Pagano became acquainted with African-American activist Al Sharpton. In 1983, Colombo crime family mobster Michael Franzese arranged a meeting with Pagano, Sharpton, and another mob associate (who was an undercover Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent). The meeting was ostensibly about the mob associate asking Sharpton for an introduction to boxing promoter Don King. However, during the meeting, the associate unsuccessfully tried to enlist Sharpton's assistance in distributing narcotics. After the meeting, the FBI approached Sharpton and allegedly garnered his assistance as an informant against Pagano. However, Sharpton denies this claim to this day.*\\"Street-Wise Impresario; Sharpton Calls the Tunes, and Players Take Their Cues\\" By MARTIN GOTTLIEB with DEAN BAQUET New York Times December 19, 1991 Promotion In the late 1980s, Pagano became a made man, or full member, of the Genovese family. He operated in the Bronx and Manhattan and was close to Genovese capo Dominick \\"Quiet Dom\\" Cirillo. With the incarceration of Genovese soldier Joseph \\"Joe Glitz\\" Galizia, Pagano was promoted to capo. Pagano oversaw the family's numbers game and sports betting rackets in East Harlem, which were operated by the Pisacano brothers. Pagano also owned a business interest in Third World Records, an African/Latino music label in New York. In June 1989, Pagano was indicted on charges of illegal gambling, loan sharking and extortion in Westchester County and Rockland County north of New York City. Pagano and his associates mediated disputes between trash haulers in the area, exercised control over a waterfront construction project in Yonkers, New York, and conducted loansharking activities.\\"5 Are Indicted As Participants In Rackets Ring\\" By JAMES FERON New York Times June 13, 1989 Pagano eventually pleaded guilty to criminal usury and promoting gambling. Gasoline bootlegging After become capo, Pagano became the Genovese family contact in the \\"Gasoline Bootlegging Rackets\\". Originated in 1987 by the Organizatsiya, a Russian criminal organization in Brooklyn, the scam involved fake transactions of large quantities of gasoline and diesel that were designed to defraud the State of New York out of excise taxes. When the New York Cosa Nostra families discovered the scam, the Genovese and three other families forced Organizatsiya to pay them a cut of their illegal profits. The families set up a group known as the Association to run the scam. Pagano and his trusted aide, mobster Anthony Palumbo, represented the Genovese interests in the Association.\\"After Emigres Began Fuel Scheme, Traditional Mob Families Moved In, Officials Say\\" By JOHN SULLIVAN New York Times September 15, 1996\\"A Crime-Cartel Indictment\\" By TERRY PRISTIN New York Times September 12, 1996 In late 1992 or early 1993, Pagano thwarted a proposed murder of a Russian mobster. Palumbo's business partner, Russian mobster Victor Zilber, asked him to arrange the murder of a Zilber employee, Russian mobster Monya Elson. When Palumbo approached Pagano for approval, Pagano immediately vetoed the hit. Pagano was afraid that killing Elson would cause major problems with the Organizatsia.\\"Feared Russian Gunman Saved by Genovese Guardian Angel\\" by Jerry Capeci The Huffington Post September 7, 2010 In the early-1990s, the FBI and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) set up a fake fuel company in Trenton, New Jersey, as part of \\"Red Daisy\\", a sting operation aimed against the bootlegging ring. In February 1992, a suspicious fire destroyed the company facilities. Soon after the fire, a mob associate approached the company owners and informed them that they would have to pay a \\"mob tax\\" to sell the bootleg gasoline. In September 1996, Pagano and Palumbo were indicted on charges of defrauding the government of $77 million in tax revenues. In September 1999, Pagano pleaded guilty to motor fuel tax evasion and was sentenced to 105 months in prison.\\"Two Plead Guilty in Fuel-Tax-Evasion Case\\" US Department of Transportation As a result of his imprisonment, Pagano lost control of many of his former rackets, including the Pisacano brothers illegal gambling operation.

Capturing the towns and destroying the castles of the existing lords, he burned the few heretics he found. All who opposed this assault, regardless of their religious beliefs, were his enemies.

He is best known for the McLafferty rearrangement reaction that was observed with mass spectrometry. With Roland Gohlke, he pioneered the technique of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. He is also known for electron capture dissociation, a method of fragmenting gas phase ions. He is the grandfather of Fred S McLafferty, a pulmonologist and intensivist at University of California San Francisco. Early life and education Fred McLafferty was born in Evanston, Illinois in 1923, but attended grade school in Omaha, Nebraska, graduating from Omaha North High School in 1940. The urgent requirements of World War II accelerated his undergraduate studies at the University of Nebraska; he obtained his B.S. degree in 1943 and thereafter entered the US armed forces. He served in western Europe during the invasion of Germany and was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge, a Purple Heart, Five Bronze Star Medals and a Presidential Unit Citation. He returned to the University of Nebraska in late 1945 and completed his M.S. degree in 1947. He went on to work under William Miller at Cornell University where he earned his Ph.D. in 1950. He went on to a postdoctoral researcher position at the University of Iowa with R.L. Shriner. Dow Chemical He took a position at Dow Chemical in Midland, Michigan in 1950 and was in charge of mass spectrometry and gas chromatography from 1950 to 1956. In 1956, he became the Director of Dow‚Äôs Eastern Research Lab in Framingham, Massachusetts. During this time, he developed the first GC/MS instruments and developed techniques for determining the structure of organic molecules by mass spectrometry, most notably in the discovery of what is now known as the McLafferty rearrangement. Academic career From 1964 to 1968, he was Professor of Chemistry at Purdue University. In 1968, he returned to his alma mater, Cornell University, to become the Peter J. W. Debye Professor of Chemistry. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1982. While at Cornell, McLafferty assembled one of the first comprehensive data bases of mass spectra and pioneered artificial intelligence techniques to interpret GC/MS results. His PBM STIRS program has widespread use to save hours of time consuming work otherwise required to manually analyze GC/MS results.

The word gained traction in Zimbabwe during the 2000s when an influx of Chinese merchants and storekeepers imported consumer products into Zimbabwe. The term carries strong connotations of widespread discontent over the continued de-industrialisation of Zimbabwe, and the replacement of its products with Chinese ones. In some quarters, \\"Zhing-zhong\\", or simply \\"zhing\\", is a slur on the Chinese. Perhaps mindful of this, the Government of Zimbabwe is reported to have banned the word. The word zhing zhong according to Thulani Chikanda refers to products from China even if it is of high quality, it is not about being cheap but about the origin. Thulani Chikanda also argues that this word was merely a petition to the government to tell China to improve quality on products. Zhing Zhong is a synonym to the South African word Fon Kong.

Early life Skujenieks was born in a family of Vensku Edvarts (real name Eduards Skujenieks), a notable publicist and a poet, and Luƒ´ze Skujeniece (daughter of Juris AlunƒÅns), the first female Latvian theatre critic. His sister was actress and poet Biruta Skujeniece. After studies in Jelgava and Rƒ´ga he studied economics at the Moscow Commerce institute. Skujenieks became a Social Democrat in 1903, but he never supported the concept of international class struggle, where nationality would be of no importance. Instead, he was one of the early proponents of Latvian national unity. After the suppression of the 1905 Russian Revolution he was forced to emigrate to London in 1906, but in 1907 was allowed to returned to Russian Empire and went on to study economics at the Moscow Commercial Institute. In 1911 he proposed political autonomy for the Baltic provinces and had to flee in exile once again. In 1913 in St. Petersburg he published the book NacionƒÅlais jautƒÅjums LatvijƒÅ (The National Question in Latvia) in defense of Latvian national rights. By 1914 he had become an opponent of the Bolsheviks led by Lenin. During World War I he worked in the Latvian War Refugee Aid Committee and in 1917 was elected to the Council of Landless Peasants of Vidzeme. Latvian politics Skujenieks' political career began as one of the leading Social Democratic members of the Democratic Bloc, and as such he was included in the Tautas padome and co- chaired the meeting which declared the independence of Latvia on 18 November 1918. In 1919 he went to the Paris Peace Conference to lobby for the international recognition of Latvia. From 1919 until 1940 he led the State Statistics Department, leaving this post only for the duration of ministerial or prime ministerial duties. In April 1920 he was elected to the Constitutional Assembly of Latvia, where he participated in creating the Constitution of Latvia. In 1921 Skujenieks and a group of MPs broke away from the mainstream Social Democrats and established his own faction, which then joined the ruling coalition. In 1922 he was elected to the 1st Saeima. He was an MP until the 1934 Latvian coup d'√©tat as the leader of Union of Social Democrats ‚Äì Mensheviks and Rural Workers, and eventually moved ideologically more to the right as the leader of the Progressive Union. On 19 December 1926 he succeeded the Prime Minister Arturs Alberings as the first Social Democratic prime minister and remained in the post until 23 January 1928, also filling the post of Minister of Interior from 19 December 1926 until 23 January 1928. On 5 February 1927 a customs union agreement with Estonia was signed. During his tenure, a 5-year trade agreement with the Soviet Union was signed on 2 June 1927. This created domestic political controversy which eventually led to Skujenieks' cabinet resignation. After the elections of October 1931, he succeeded KƒÅrlis Ulmanis on 6 December 1931 as the Prime Minister. Skujenieks led a coalition government which held office until 23 March 1933. Due to instability of his coalition, Skujenieks also held the post of Minister of Finance (21 February 1932 - 23 March 1933) and Interior Minister (6 December 1931 - 20 March 1932). On 5 February 1932, a non- aggression treaty with the Soviet Union was signed. This was the time of the Great Depression, when parliamentary democracy was losing support in much of Europe. Skujenieks, by this time more nationalistic and critical of the Saeima, allegedly was involved in a coup plot by Social Democrat Fƒìlikss Cielƒìns, his good friend, general JƒÅnis Balodis and some leading officers, who intended to stage a coup and then give the power to Skujenieks.Nenovƒìrtƒìtais Marƒ£ers Skujenieks Between 1931 and 1934 his party published the newspaper Latvie≈°u balss (The Voice of Latvians). Later life After the 15 May 1934 Latvian coup d'√©tat by Prime Minister KƒÅrlis Ulmanis, Skujenieks served in the mostly ceremonial post of Deputy Prime Minister until 16 June 1938.

Fuller is most recognizable for presiding over the controversial case of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman. On August 1, 2015, he resigned following a federal court investigation into allegations about spousal abuse. Education and career He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Alabama in 1982 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Alabama School of Law in 1985. He was an attorney in private practice from 1985 to 1996, when he became Chief Assistant District Attorney for the 12th Judicial Circuit of Alabama. In 1996, he was elected District Attorney of the 12th Circuit where he served until his appointment as a federal judge. As the District Attorney, Fuller was criticized for giving \\"extraordinary wages\\" to staff, including increasing office investigator Bruce DeVane's \\"salary to almost $6,000 every two weeks\\" until it nearly doubled by the end of 2000, and Fuller later testified during the proceedings about the retirements he approved in 2005. On August 1, 2002, he was nominated by George W. Bush and confirmed by the United States Senate on November 14, 2002. He received his commission on November 26, 2002.  U.S. v. Siegelman  In 2004, former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman was charged with Medicaid fraud, but the day after his trial began, prosecutors abruptly dropped all charges and judge U. W. Clemon threw out much of the prosecution's evidence and stated that no new charges could be refiled based on the disallowed evidence. In 2006, Siegelman was charged again and Judge Fuller presided over the criminal trial for bribery and obstruction of justice. After a highly publicized trial that spanned several months, a jury convicted former Governor Siegelman and co- Defendant Richard Scrushy, founder and former CEO of HealthSouth, of federal funds bribery relating to Governor Siegelman's failed Alabama education lottery campaign. Prosecutors alleged that Scrushy, who supported Siegelman's 1998 gubernatorial opponent, Governor Fob James, reconciled their differences. Siegelman initially resisted, but later agreed to meet with Scrushy. According to trial testimony from a Siegelman aide, Nick Bailey, after the meeting ended Siegelman emerged with a $250,000 check and told Bailey that Scrushy \\"was halfway there.\\" When Bailey asked Siegelman what Scrushy wanted for the contribution, Siegelman allegedly said, \\"the C-O-N Board.\\" However, Bailey's statement was incorrect as evidence showed there was no meeting with Siegelman.\\"The Prosecution of Siegelman\\", See 60 Minutes CBS television broadcast, Feb. 24, 2008. The jury was deadlocked twice. Fuller then told the jury they had the potential for \\"a lifetime job for you as a juror,\\" noting that he had \\"a lifetime appointment\\" and was \\"a very patient person,\\" and the jury convicted the following day.See Trial Transcript at page 7857, U.S. v. Siegelman At his first sentencing hearing, Fuller sentenced him to 88 months. Siegelman defenders argue that the sentence is unprecedented and the punishment excessive because, for example, former Alabama Governor H. Guy Hunt, a Republican, was found guilty of personally pocketing $200,000 and did not receive jail time.\\"Alabama Governor Found Guilty Of Ethics Charges and Is Ousted\\" The New York Times, 4/23/93. Siegelman appealed and on March 6, 2009, the Eleventh Circuit upheld key bribery, conspiracy and obstruction counts against Siegelman and refused his request for a new trial, finding no evidence that the conviction was unjust, but struck two of the seven charges on which Siegelman was convicted and ordered a new sentencing hearing. It affirmed Judge Hinkle's decision (Judge Fuller asked that a separate judge be assigned to handle the motion) that Judge Fuller need not recuse himself from the case. The Eleventh Circuit noted that recusal motions must be made before trial, but the Defense did not learn of Fuller's conflicts (see \\"Criticism\\" below) until after the trial had begun. It also upheld the jury instructions that Fuller gave to the jury prior to their deliberations. In December 2009, Fuller then reduced Governor Siegelman's sentence by 10 months during re-sentencing, leaving him with 69 months. = Criticism = Fuller is accused of acting unethically.\\"Fuller‚Äôs ethics called into question in suit\\" The Wetumpka Herald, 5/16/12.\\"Sex, Drugs, And Violence Are At The Heart Of Divorce Case Against Siegelman Judge Mark Fuller\\" The Public Record, 5/22/12.

Investigation and resignation On August 9, 2014, Fuller was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery, punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $1,000, for an incident of domestic violence involving his second wife, Kelli, following her allegation that he was having an affair with a law-clerk employee.Eliott C. McLaughlin and John Branch, \\"Federal judge jailed after alleged domestic dispute\\", CNN.com, August 12, 2014. Fuller was jailed overnight following his arrest. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reassigned cases in Fuller's court to other district court judges, and would not assign any new cases to Fuller until further order of the circuit court. In September, he accepted a plea deal that would \\"expunge\\" the charges if he undergoes a drug and alcohol evaluation, completes a counseling program and attend a domestic violence program for 24 weeks.Federal judge Mark Fuller accepts plea deal in domestic violence case; could have arrest record expunged, al.com, September 5, 2014. The Judicial Conference of the United States began looking into the accusations against Fuller. By September 2014, several state and national politicians called on Fuller to resign. Democratic Representative Terri Sewell publicly stated Fuller should resign, and other members of Alabama's congressional delegation followed suit. On September 17, 2014, Republican U.S. Senators Richard Shelby and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, and Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, called on Fuller to resign from the District Court.Mary Orndroff Troyan and Brian Lyman, \\"Senators Shelby, Sessions want Mark Fuller to resign\\", Montgomery Advertiser, September 18, 2014.

On May 29, 2015, Fuller sent President Barack Obama a letter of resignation effective August 1, 2015. In September 2015, a committee of federal judges who investigated Fuller told Congress it should consider impeaching Fuller despite his resignation, citing as justification its determination that Fuller had engaged in \\"reprehensible conduct\\" as there was \\"substantial evidence\\" that Fuller had physically abused his wife \\"at least eight times\\" and that Fuller \\"was also accused of committing perjury\\" when denying abusing his wife.

History  In the 1890s the Second Boer War disrupted the sex trade in the gold-mining areas of Witwatersrand in South Africa, and the dispersal of the sex trade led to \\"urban problems\\" in what was then Southern Rhodesia. Public pressure led to the passage of immorality legislation in 1900. Prior to independence (1980) colonial vagrancy laws were used against sex workers. In 1983 there was a major effort to eliminate sex work in post-independence Zimbabwe by rounding up hundreds of women and detaining them until they could prove they were not involved in the trade, otherwise they were sent to resettlement camps. A number of women's groups supported this as strengthening marriage.S Jacobs, T Howard. Women in Zimbabwe: Stated policy and State action, in Haleh Afshar 9ed. Women, State, and Ideology: Studies from Africa and Asia. SUNY Press, 1987 As with many African countries, the onset of HIV/AIDS dramatically increased the interest in sex work.  Law and politics  Prostitution is addressed in Part III of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act 2004. The police can arrest any woman walking (in the streets) after 7pm. In 2011 Thabita Khumalo, a MDC-T MP, proposed that prostitution in Zimbabwe be decriminalised. She stated that decriminalizing prostitution would address three important issues: corruption, HIV/Aids and women‚Äôs rights. Khumalo, who has suggested that the word prostitute be changed to pleasure engineer, has continued her campaign despite being demoted in her party in 2012. She has claimed her position on the issue may have contributed to this. She is supported by the Zimbabwe Women‚Äôs Resource Centre and Network (ZWRCN), in addition to sex workers themselves. The UK based Open Society Foundation reported in 2012 that the police are the greatest abusers of sex workers in Zimbabwe.Zimbabwe police worst abusers of prostitutes. Bulawayo 24 July 23, 2012 Sex trafficking Zimbabwe is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and girls from Zimbabwean towns bordering South Africa, Mozambique, and Zambia are subjected to sex trafficking in brothels catering to long-distance truck drivers on both sides of the borders. Zimbabwean women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in cities and surrounding towns. Reports indicate that adults have recruited girls for child sex trafficking in Victoria Falls. The practice of ngozi, giving a family member to another family to avenge the spirits of a murdered relative, creates a vulnerability to trafficking. Zimbabwean women are lured into hospitality largely in neighbouring countries and some women become victims of forced prostitution. Women are exploited in sex trafficking in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Many Zimbabwean adult and child migrants enter South Africa with the assistance of taxi drivers who transport them to the border at Beitbridge or nearby unofficial crossing locations and are subject to sex trafficking. Some of the migrants are transferred to criminal gangs that subject them to forced prostitution in Musina, Pretoria, Johannesburg, or Durban. Refugees from Somalia and Democratic Republic of the Congo reportedly travel from Zimbabwe‚Äôs Tongogara Refugee Camp to Harare, where they are forced into prostitution. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Zimbabwe as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.

The common practice of entertaining a guest in the home led to the creation of this category of plays and while the drawing room itself has fallen out of favour, the play format has continued to provide a source of entertainment. While there is no date or authority directly ascribed to the term drawing room play, there is evidence that the term was derived from the English habit of putting on these short works for guests while entertaining in the drawing room of the home. In French usage the room and the social gathering it contained are equally the salon. Types Beginning with the early forms of drama, the drawing room play has evolved to encompass comedy as well as to include the forms of the dramatic monologue. The play format itself has also grown out of the traditional drawing room performance and back into main street theatre and film. Drawing room comedy is also sometimes called the \\"comedy of manners.\\" Many of the drawing room plays adapted some form of social criticism in the transition from the Victorian period into the Modern era. Examples * The Elder Statesman (1959) was the last of T. S. Eliot's drawing room works. * Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest is one of the most widely known examples of the drawing room play. * Several of the collected works of No√´l Coward are also considered typical of the form. * Paul Rudnick's Regrets Only is a contemporary drawing room comedy released in 2006. * Additional authors include Clement Scott, Walter Besant, Grace Luce Irwin and Arnold Bennett.

Ahead of the 2007 Commonwealth leaders' meeting in the city, the prostitutes were moved out of the city centre to designated zones in the suburbs. Violence erupted in Kampala in 2016 between Ugandan and Kenyan prostitutes. The Kenyan prostitutes were charging a low price, and the Ugandans were angry that the Kenyans were taking all their trade. Local leaders intervened to stop the fighting, and the Kenyans agreed to charge the same price as the Ugandans. Two Kenyans were injured. In an attempt to stop the influx of Kenyan prostitutes, the authorities planned to charge a registration fee. With 6,000 construction workers building the new Hydroelectric Power Station fuelling demand, there are many prostitutes in the Karuma area. Lyantonde is a truck-stop town and the main stop-over on the main highway from Kampala to Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda. There are many prostitutes in the town to service the truck drivers needs. The area has the highest rate of HIV in the country, nearly twice the national average. HIV Uganda is in the top 10 of countries with the highest HIV prevalence rates. Sex workers are a high risk group. In 2013 they had a 34.2% prevalence rate. Even in Kampala, where HIV infection is the highest in the country, clients are reluctant to use condoms and will offer many times the usual rate for unprotected sex. Sex trafficking Uganda is a source, transit, and destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Ugandan girls and boys are exploited in prostitution. Recruiters target girls and women aged 13‚Äì24 years for domestic sex trafficking, especially near sports tournaments and road construction projects. An international organisation reported that most internal trafficking victims are Ugandans. During the reporting period, Ugandan victims were identified in neighboring countries, including Kenya, South Sudan, and the DRC. Children from the DRC, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, and South Sudan are exploited in prostitution in Uganda. South Sudanese children in refugee settlements in northern Uganda are vulnerable to trafficking. Young women remained the most vulnerable to transnational trafficking, usually seeking employment as domestic workers in the Middle East; at times Ugandan women were fraudulently recruited for employment and then exploited in forced prostitution. Ugandan migrant workers are subjected to sex trafficking in United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Turkey, and Algeria. Despite the government's complete ban in 2016 on Ugandans‚Äô travel abroad for domestic work, some licensed and unlicensed agencies circumvented this ban by sending Ugandans through Kenya and Tanzania. Traffickers, who appear to be increasingly organized, are frequently relatives or friends of victims, or may pose as wealthy women or labor recruiters promising vulnerable Ugandans well-paid jobs abroad or in Uganda's metropolitan areas. Some traffickers threatened to harm the victims‚Äô family or confiscated travel documents.

The 199th is equipped with the F-22A Raptor. Overview The 199th Fighter Squadron is a unit of the 154th Wing. They operate the F-22A Raptor, the Air Force's 5th generation fighter aircraft with a select component of active duty personnel acting in the cadre role. Its combination of stealth, supercruise, maneuverability and integrated avionics, coupled with improved supportability, represents an exponential leap in warfighting capabilities. The Raptor performs both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions allowing full realization of operational concepts vital to the 21st-century Air Force. History =World War II= Established in late 1944 at Peterson Field, Colorado, as the 464th Fighter Squadron. Trained under XXII Bomber Command as a Very Long Range P-47N Thunderbolt bomber escort squadron, programmed for B-29 Superfortress escort duty from Okinawa. For four months they received combat training for long-range escort, strafing, and dive-bombing. Training delayed due to P-47N aircraft non-availability, finally equipped in the late spring of 1945 with the long-distance fighters. Deployed to Okinawa in June 1945 as part of the 507th Fighter Group and prepared for the invasion of Japan along with the 413th and 414th Fighter Groups, all equipped with P-47N. On 1 July 1945 it began flying airstrikes from Ie Shima, targeting enemy ships, railroad bridges, airfields, factories, and barracks in Japan, Korea, and China. On 8 August 1945 the group escorted B-29 bombers on a raid, shooting down several Japanese fighters. The squadron flew some long distance fighter-bomber sweeps over Japanese Home Islands 1 July 1945 ‚Äì 14 August 1945 but never performed operational B-29 escort missions due to the end of the war in August. Last \\"Ace in a Day\\" of World War II was 1st LT Oscar Perdomo of the 464th. Remained in Okinawa until inactivated in May 1946. =Hawaii Air National Guard= The Hawaii Air National Guard F-102 'Deuces' fly over the new 154th Wing complex. The 154th Wing hangar complex was dedicated 17 February 1962, during the Hawaii Air National Guard's 15th anniversary luau. The wartime 463d Fighter Squadron was re-designated as the 199th Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the Hawaii Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Bellows Field, Waimanalo, Hawaii, and was extended federal recognition on 4 November 1946 by the National Guard Bureau. The 199th Fighter Squadron was bestowed the lineage, history, honors, and colors of the 463d Fighter Squadron. The squadron was equipped with F-47N Thunderbolts and was operationally gained by Seventh Air Force. Its mission was the air defense of Hawaii. Bellows Field, which was attacked during the 7 December 1941 Japanese attack on Oahu, was excess after World War II ended, and it served as home for the Hawaii Air National Guard. In 1947, the costs to operate Bellows as an active Air National Guard station led the Territorial government to negotiate with the Army about its future. The Army indicated that it wanted to retain the field in a commissioned status but that it had no funds to maintain the field. The Army offered the Aviation Unit of the Hawaiian National Guard joint use of the field provided all maintenance was assumed by the Guard. A settlement was reached to move the 199th to Hickam Field, and to use excess facilities there. Air Defense mission 1x1px The Very-Long-Range (VLR) F-47N was used for air defense patrols over the Islands and had a range which could extend its interception ability over a thousand miles from Hickam. The 199th was not federalized during the Korean War, however many of its members volunteered to serve. The 199th joined the jet age in 1954 when it finally retired its aging Thunderbolts for F-86E Sabre day fighters that were made available after serving in combat over the skies of Korea. The squadron stood runway alert as part of the air defense forces in Hawaii beginning in 1954, having alert pilots in the cockpit from 30 minutes before sunrise to 30 minutes after sunset each day. Beginning in 1958, the squadron received F-86L Sabre Interceptors which could be controlled by Ground Control Interceptor station radar and could operate 24/7/365 in all weather conditions. On 1 December 1960, the 199th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 154th Fighter-Interceptor Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 199th FIS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 154th Headquarters, 154th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 154th Combat Support Squadron, and the 154th USAF Dispensary. TF-102A Delta Dagger 55-4041, Hawaii ANG, 1964 Along with the change to Group status, on 7 December the Hawaiian Air National Guard began receiving Mach-1 F-102 Delta Dagger interceptors eventually 29 F-102s were received. This was in line with the policy of equipping ANG units with one generation of aircraft behind the active-duty Air Defense Command forces. For the next sixteen years, the 154th FIG operated the Delta Daggers establishing an excellent safety record. In December 1961, The new Hawaii Air National Guard (HANG) complex was completed and consisted of 60 acres. The land was originally part of Fort Kamehameha and had been acquired in 1960 by permit from the U.S. Army to the Hawaii ANG. The 154th flew the Delta Dagger throughout the 1960s, and although the Hawaii ANG was not activated during the Vietnam War, several of its pilots volunteered for combat duty in Southeast Asia. The group was the longest user of the interceptor, being equipped with the F-102 long after most of its Air National Guard counterparts were upgraded to the F-106. Tactical fighters 199th Tactical Fighter Squadron F-4C Phantom 63-7632 in Air Defense interceptor markings, 1985. The last F-102A finally left ANG service in October 1976, when the 199th FIS of the Hawaii ANG traded in their Delta Daggers for F-4C Phantom II and the 154th became a Tactical Fighter Group. The F-4C was a workhorse tactical fighter-bomber during the Vietnam War, and could also be used as an effective interceptor. The Hawaii ANG used the Phantom in both roles, employing it during training exercises with Army and Marine units in ground exercises, as well as retaining the standing air defense alert at Hickam. On 3 November 1978, the 154th became a Composite Group with the addition of a C-130A Hercules and a C-7A Caribou flight After a decade flying the F-4C, the 154th received F-15A Eagles in 1987 along with a twin-seat F-15B trainer as part of the retirement of the F-4 from the Air Force inventory. The F-15As were received from the 21st Tactical Fighter Wing, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, which was upgrading to the F-15C model. The Eagles received from Alaska had been upgraded though the F-15 Multi-Stage Improvement Program (MSIP) and were used in an air defense mission, which the Hawaii ANG had taken over. In mid-1991, early F-15C versions were received, and the Hawaii ANG operated both the A and C models of the Eagle for the next two decades. F-15A Eagle 77-0079 in 2000. In 1989 with inactivation of the PACAF 326th Air Division, the 154th Composite Group took over the air defense Radar mission in Hawaii. The 169th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began operating a JSS radar site at Mount Kaala, Oahu along with the FAA, and the 150th Aircraft Control and Warning Flight operates a joint-use JSS radar site at Kokee Air Force Station, Kauai. These radar sites are linked to the NORAD Hawaii Region Air Operations Center (HIRAOC) at Wheeler Army Airfield, Oahu, . With these two sites, 24/7 air surveillance of the Hawaiian island chain is provided. The 154th Aircraft Control Squadron on Kauai also provides a mobile, self-sustainable, combat ready, forward extension and control element equipped to meet the Air Force's ground theater air control systems. Modern era In March 1992, with the end of the Cold War, the 154th adopted the Air Force Objective Organization plan, and the unit was re-designated as the 154th Group. In January 1993, the 203d Air Refueling Squadron was recognized and activated by the National Guard Bureau. The 203d assumed the rotating deployments of KC-135s to Hickam which started in the 1970s by SAC-gained stateside Air National Guard squadrons. On 1 August 1994 the C-130 flight was expanded and the 204th Airlift Squadron was recognized and activated by the National Guard Bureau. 199th Fighter Squadron F-22A Raptors, 2012 In 1995, in accordance with the Air Force \\"One Base-One Wing\\" directive, the 155th was changed in status to a Wing, and the 199th Fighter Squadron was assigned to the new 154th Operations Group. In July 2010, the Hawaii Air National Guard welcomed the first of its new inventory of F-22A Raptors. The 154th Wing was the second ANG unit to be equipped with the F-22. The 199th is planned to have 20 aircraft, the initial aircraft being transferred from the 325th Fighter Wing, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida; the remaining 18 aircraft will come from the 1st Fighter Wing, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The F-22 is designed to counter advanced surface-to-air missile systems and next-generation fighters equipped with launch-and-leave missile capability. The F-15s were sent to the boneyard, the last Eagle leaving in 2011. The 199th operates with the active-duty 19th Fighter Squadron as their cadre unit, although the Hawaii ANG is responsible for seventy-five percent of the mission configuration. This is the first time an Air National Guard unit, the 199th Fighter Squadron, has taken the position of only having an active duty squadron as a cadre flying unit.

History The street used to be called Stockwelle Street, also running along the line of Walton Street and Little Clarendon Street, to the north of the current Worcester Street. The name \\"Stoke\\" or \\"Stock\\" is other associated with streams. At the junction with Hythe Bridge Street, there was a well, known as Cornwell or Cornwall. The Carmelites (also known as Whitefriars) settled in the street in 1256. The street was built up by 1279 and Gloucester College was established in 1283. The Carmelites moved to Beaumont Palace nearby in 1317. In the Tudor period Cornwell became known as Plato's Well, distinguishing it from Aristotle's Well close to Aristotle Lane to the north. In 1714 Gloucester College was re-established as Worcester College, one of the colleges of the University of Oxford. The street was known as Worcester Street by about 1850. The Oxford Canal was completed at the end of 1789 with its terminus in a coal wharf on the east side of George Street between New Road and George Street Mews. It had a goods wharf on the west side of Worcester Street between Hythe Bridge Street and Park End Street. The southern part of Worcester Street crossed the canal via a humpback bridge. Nuffield College, at the corner of the southern end of Worcester Street (left) and New Road (right) In 1937 Lord Nuffield bought the coal and goods wharves. In 1951 he had the canal south of Hythe Bridge Street filled in, and had Worcester Street south of the junction with George Street Mews re-aligned and widened. On the east side of the street, on the site of the coal wharf, Lord Nuffield had Nuffield College built. It is a graduate college of the University of Oxford. On the west side, on the site of the former goods wharf, Nuffield planned to have the college extended. But this part of the college was never built, and the site has been a public car park ever since. Location Worcester street runs roughly north‚Äìsouth. The northern section is part of the A4144 road. Its northern end is opposite the eponymous Worcester College, at the junction with Beaumont Street and Walton Street. Worcester College occupies the western side of the street from this junction as far south as the crossroads with Hythe Bridge Street and George Street. Gloucester Green, which includes Oxford's bus station, is to the east. The Refugee Studies Centre, part of the University of Oxford‚Äôs Department of International Development, is also here. From the crossroads the A4144 continues west as Hythe Bridge Street. The southern part of the street links the crossroads with the junction of Park End Street and New Road at the southern end. Worcester Street Car Park is on the west side. Nuffield College is in the east side of the street, between George Street Mews and New Road.

Geography Sainte-Livrade- sur-Lot is located along the banks of Lot River. History Human inhabitation has been present around the area since the early Iron Age. The commune of Sainte-Livrade-sur-Lot itself was founded in 1289 as Sainte-Livrade d'Olt, Olt being the Occitan and former name of the Lot River. The current name was adopted in December 1919. Despite its small size, Sainte-Livrade-sur- Lot is a multicultural town that has been host to numerous immigrant communities since the 20th century. The first prominent immigrant community to the town were Italians who escaped the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini during the 1920s and 1930s. They were soon followed by Spanish immigrants, also escaping fascism in their homeland under Francisco Franco. Following the First Indochina War in 1954, in which Vietnam won its independence from France, Vietnamese troops who fought alongside the French were brought to metropolitan France as a recognition for their loyalty to the country and for fear that they would be persecuted by the new independent government. The troops, along with their families, were housed at camps designated as Centre d'accueil des Fran√ßais d'Indochine, of which Sainte-Livrade-sur-Lot hosted the largest of three. Later immigrant communities to the town included Pied-Noirs from the newly independent former French colony of Algeria following the Algerian War in 1962. Immigrants from the Maghreb, especially Algeria, also began arriving in the 1970s and 1980s. Demographics In 2011, the population of the commune was 6,182. Refugee camp After France's defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and Vietnam's independence from France in 1954, roughly five thousand Vietnamese troops who fought for France, as well as their families and Vietnamese married to French colonists, were repatriated to the country. Their arrival led to the creation of refugee camps designated as Camps d'accueil des rapatri√©s d'Indochine (Center for the Reception of the French of Indochina), of which Sainte-Livrade-sur-Lot hosted the largest, containing nearly 1,500 people at its height. The camp was converted into barracks from a World War II munitions factory, in which residents lived in rudimentary conditions with a government sponsored hospital and school. The population of the camp declined as children of the refugees moved away from the area after they grew up, due to limited education and employment opportunities. Today, residents largely consist of surviving refugees and some families descended from the migrants. As the war in Indochina was unpopular, the French government did not do much to improve the lives of the community's people until recently, when plans were underway to convert the barrack-like homes of the camp to social housing. Nevertheless, Sainte-Livrade-sur-Lot hosts grocery stores and a Buddhist temple that serve the Vietnamese community.

Mihailoviƒá was born in the village of Ostrovica, near Rudnik in the Serbian Despotate. His book, Memoirs of a Janissary () was written at the end of the 15th century, probably between 1490 and 1501, and provides a unique insight into life in the Ottoman Army of the time. Mihailoviƒá's stated motivation in writing the book was to provide a detailed account of the Ottoman state and its military structure in order to assist the Christian powers in their struggle against the Ottomans. Memoirs His memoirs give no insight into his early life. Instead, they begin in 1455, when an army under the command of Sultan Mehmed II laid siege to the castle of Novo Brdo for forty days. The Ottoman Army had marched from Edirne via Sofia in a campaign to establish certain control over the area that is now Kosovo. At the time, Novo Brdo was a rich mining city for silver. The garrison surrendered on June 1, 1455. According to Mihailoviƒá, the Sultan stood at the small gate of the castle and sorted the boys from the girls. He then sorted the women on one side of a ditch, and the men on the other. He then ordered all men of any distinguished rank or importance decapitated. The young women and girls, some 700 of them, were taken and given to soldiers and Ottoman commanders. Following this, the young boys, some 320 of them including Mihailoviƒá and his two brothers, were taken to be trained as members of the janissaries. He wrote later that he and nineteen other boys ran away during the night near a village called Samokovo, only to be recaptured, bound, and beaten. The area in which he was referring to was most likely Samokovo in Serbia, located about 63 kilometers north of Pristina, and 204 kilometers south of Belgrade. He writes that one year later he was present at the Siege of Belgrade. While it is likely that he was present, he had not been with the Ottomans long enough to have become a janissary by that time. Mihailoviƒá goes into great detail about that siege and the events that followed. =Campaign against Vlad III and in Bosnia= After completing his janissary training, he next serves with the Ottoman Army during its advance against Vlad III of Wallachia, who would later be the inspiration for the novel Dracula by Bram Stoker. In this segment, Mihailoviƒá confirms the use of impalement by Vlad III, and adds the fact that Vlad III often cut off the noses of Ottoman soldiers and sent them to Hungary to show the number of enemy soldiers he had killed. He states that in one battle, while the Ottomans were crossing the Danube, some 250 janissaries were killed by the Wallachians, but the sheer numbers of the Ottoman force eventually drove Vlad III's forces away. He also records that during the night the Ottomans were most fearful of Wallachian attack, and that they protected their camps with wooden stakes and around the clock guards. This still did not prevent attacks, and they lost many soldiers, camels and horses. He gives some mention of the \\"forest of the impaled\\" that has since become legend, in which Vlad III is alleged to have lined the roadways with thousands of impaled Turkish soldiers, but Mihailoviƒá never actually saw this, being in the rear of the army, thus writing about it on the word of others. His next writings were about the campaign to take Bosnia in 1463. He details the sieges involved in that campaign, and as it comes to a close he and a garrison of janissaries are left to hold the fortress at Zvecaj. By this time he seems to have had a considerable rank. His force was not able to withstand a siege led by Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, and Mihailoviƒá was one of the prisoners taken. After his identity and ethnicity was discovered, he was repatriated back to his own country.

The village lies on the road from Agen to Bourg-de-Visa in the valley of the Escorneb≈ìuf, a tributary of the S√©oune. It is in the arrondissement of Agen and the province of Nouvelle-Aquitaine The population is around 450. History St-Maurin, the only village in France of that name, is named after the saint to whom the village's 11th-century abbey is dedicated. The abbey, parts of which still stand beside the village square, was built by Benedictine monks. Reliefs cut into the stone of an archway portray Maurin having the top of his head cut off and his brain spooned out. The abbey was destroyed by the Albigeois war, then rebuilt. It was again ravaged in the 14th century, this time by troops on the English side in the Hundred Years War. It was again rebuilt in the 15th century but was then attacked once more by Huguenots. The abbey passed into the ownership of the village in 1645 and was never rebuilt. Many of the walls were demolished as a source of building stone but much of the main arch still stands. The monks' garden exists and so do the stables, now houses. The abbey is now a Monument de France and is being restored. Beneath and beside the town hall is a museum of artefacts from the village's agricultural past. The village has a school, sports ground, swimming pool and small businesses.

The 203d is equipped with the Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker. Overview The 203d Air Refueling Squadron is a unit of the 154th Wing. It is an associate Unit with the 96th Air Refueling Squadron at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. The squadron flies the Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker, which provides the core aerial-refueling capability for the Air Force and has been in this role for more than 50 years. It also provides aerial-refueling support to Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps and allied-nation aircraft. The KC-135 is also capable of transporting litter and ambulatory patients using patient support pallets during aeromedical evacuations. History Established in 1993 to provide the Hawaii Air National Guard an air refueling mission and to establish an air refueling capability over the middle Pacific Ocean. It began as a small 4 aircraft squadron until 1995 when it was authorized to grow to 8 aircraft and increased personnel. From late February to April 1998, four KC-135R aircraft from the 203d, and over 200 154th Wing maintenance and support guard members deployed to Istres Air Base, France, to participate in Operation Deliberate Forge. As real world hostilities began, the focus turned to Operation Allied Force. Seventy combat sorties were flown with a 100 percent mission success rate and zero ground/air mishaps or injuries, and over 3.9 million pounds of fuel were transferred to U.S. and NATO aircraft. When political and military tensions built up in Southwest Asia, a KC-135R and guard members from the Squadron and 154th Logistics Group were deployed to Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, to support Operation Phoenix Scorpion in November 1998. The unit took part in exercise RIMPAC 2000, taking place in June 2000. In February 2001, a KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft from the squadron provided assistance to the U.S. Department of Defense humanitarian aid airlift to earthquake stricken India. A 203d KC-135 tanker took off from Hickam Air Force Base to refuel the first India-bound Lockheed C-5 Galaxy cargo aircraft laden with relief supplies. The U.S. Air Force C-5 aircraft had departed Travis Air Force Base, California, loaded with heavy equipment and other relief supplies needed in the disaster areas. On 4 February 2003, two squadron KC-135R Stratotankers from the squadron refueled two Air Combat Command Rockwell B-1B Lancers over the Pacific Ocean while the bombers finished up a 19-hour, more than 15,000-mile, global power mission.

Several of these pieces have a community component, combining amateurs and young people with professionals in the tradition of Benjamin Britten's Noye's Fludde. King's first chamber opera, The Snow Queen, was composed for the British soprano Jane Manning and her virtuoso ensemble Jane's Minstrels. The Snow Queen was described by one reviewer as \\"music of distinctive beauty with disarming theatre sense.\\"White (1 January 1996) The opera Jonah (libretto by Michael Irwin (author)) was commissioned by the Canterbury Festival and first produced in Canterbury Cathedral in 1996; the dramatic cantata Gethsemane was premiered by Florilegium at the Spitalfields Festival in 1998; the Brunel (opera project),Odam, George and Bannan, Nicholas (eds.)

Some of the clashing rhythms and textural layerings are mind-boggling.\\";Pettitt (22 November 2004) the dramatic cantata Hear our Voice (co-written with the British composer Jonathan Dove) was premiered in London, Nuremberg and Prague in 2006; the chamber opera Das Babylon Experiment (German libretto by Michael Kerstan) was produced in Nuremberg in 2008. King composed an experimental dramatic cantata Schoenberg in Hollywood (libretto by Alasdair Middleton), premiered in Guildhall School of Music and Drama's Milton Court concert hall in 2015; the comic faux-Baroque cantata Il Pastorale, l'Urbano e il Suburbano (libretto by Alasdair Middleton) was first performed at Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh in 2015 and the chamber opera The Pied Piper (libretto by Michael Irwin (author)) was first produced at Stour Music Festival, with the British countertenor Michael Chance in the title role, in 2015.

His Robert Schumann in Three Pieces were recorded by the Avenue A ensemble and described, by one critic, as \\"rich and sumptuous, with some spine-tingling moments\\";http://www.musicweb- international.com/classRev/2009/Apr09/Rocking_horses_WVR002.htm King has composed two string quartets (Quartet 2001 and Four Places in Yorkshire) both premiered by the Fitzwilliam String Quartet; his orchestral work Totentango was first performed in 2010 by the London Symphony Orchestra and a 'Hitchcockian tone poem‚Äô called Velocity, for ensemble, chorus and big band, was premiered by the Aurora Orchestra in 2011. Blue, a rhapsody for piano and chamber orchestra, was written in 2011 for the Savant pianist Derek Paravicini with whom Matthew King had previously improvised on BBC Radio 4 in 2009.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nvdvc In 2018 King composed a new three movement piano concerto for Derek Paravicini which was first performed at the Mainly Mozart Festival in San Diego conducted by Michael Francis (conductor) King has also experimented with unusual combinations of instruments, sometimes located in unconventional performing environments. The King's Wood Symphony (2007) for multiple horns with percussion and an electronic score by Nye Parry was composed for performance in a forest (originally King's Wood in Kent). Described as \\"a site-specific symphony, one that could never sound the same way twice\\",Maycock (26 June 2007) the work utilises the harmonic spectra of natural horns and electronically altered horn sounds calling to each other across a vast performing space. King's Wood Symphony also gave rise to two chamber works, a trio for violin, horn and piano, and a nonet of horns with electronics, both premiered in the Wigmore Hall in 2007. An ambitious community project in 2008 gave rise to the Odyssean Variations, premiered by the British cellist Natalie Clein and an orchestra of young musicians from the London Borough of Hackney, at LSO St Luke's in London. Una Piccolo Sinfoniahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h35uxG0t3g (2011) is a miniature symphony in three movements for an ensemble of nine piccolos. King embarked on a series of increasingly political protest pieces, including Fix This (2012) for piano, violin, cello, electric guitar and 2 percussionists, first performed at the Royal Northern College of Music in which theme tunes and catchphrases associated with Jimmy Savile are subjected to a brutal and surreal outpouring of musical rage. Piano works As a pianist, King has focussed his attention on a series of piano works: his short miniature, Sonatas (2005) takes only a minute to perform and contains a succession of 32 bars, quoting from all of Beethoven‚Äôs piano sonatas in chronological order. He composed sequences of nocturnes, polonaise (dance)s and Contemplations (after Erik Satie). He composed a cycle of single movement piano sonatas, in the tradition of Scarlatti, but inspired by a wide range of topics including Hildegard of Bingen, Duke Ellington, Bernard Herrman, Italian Opera, Irish Folk Music, Morton Feldman, Derek Jarman and Bill Evans among others. Educator An alumnus of the University of York, King is also an educator: from 1998 - 2001 he was head of composition at the Yehudi Menuhin School and is professor of composition at Guildhall School of Music & Drama. For over a decade he has led workshops for Hackney Music Development Trust. He has led workshops for Bridging Arts in Salzburg and guest-leads the Wigmore Study Group at the Wigmore Hall in London. He has presented a number of programmes on BBC Radio 4 and Radio 3.

Since the church's founding in 1958, it has become one of the largest churches in the United States. Weekly church attendance averages 7,000, making it the largest church in Wisconsin and one of the 100-largest churches in the United States. History The church was founded in 1958 as the First Baptist Church of Brookfield, when 30 Christians met at Leland Elementary School in Elm Grove. The next year, Elmbrook called its first salaried pastor, Ted Anderson. In 1963, Pastor Bob Hobson was called to lead the church and the name was changed to Elmbrook Baptist Church. The following year, the church moved into its first building on Calhoun Road, in Brookfield. In 1966 the church built a 450-seat sanctuary and attendance increased from 300 to 700 by 1970. In 1968, the pastoral staff grew to two persons, a second morning service and evening service were added, and the church dropped the Baptist affiliation and officially became Elmbrook Church. In 1970, Evangelist Stuart Briscoe was called by the church leadership to be its new senior pastor, upon the resignation of Bob Hobson. Briscoe had been serving with Capernwray Missionary Fellowship of Torchbearers, in Carnforth, England and had originally come to Elmbrook to preach at a series of meetings. In 1972, rapid growth led to Elmbrook using the Ruby Isle Theater for its second service. In 1973, Elmbrook purchased for $100,000 at 777 South Barker Road, in Brookfield, and began construction on a new facility. In 1975, the first service was held in a new 1,380-seat sanctuary, the pastoral staff grew to six, and a second Sunday morning service was added with a Saturday evening service beginning in 1977. A third Sunday service was added in 1979. In 1982, the south wing classrooms and staff offices were added and the sanctuary was expanded. In 1984, Briscoe's messages began to be telecast on Sundays on WISN-TV in Milwaukee. In 1988, the West Wing Activity Center, which included a gymnasium and classrooms, was added. With weekly church attendance exceeding 5,000, in 1992, construction began on a 3,400-seat Worship Center (completed in 1994) and educational wing. At the time, Elmbrook had 18 pastors, 3,200 members, and supported 150 missionaries. Several construction projects were completed in 1996: the 3rd floor education addition, Amphitheater and remodelled Chapel (the old sanctuary), Resource Library, Garden of Readin‚Äô bookstore, Fellowship Hall and Kitchen, with 7,000 adults attending each week, 20 pastors on staff, and 3,600 members. In 1998, Elmbrook celebrated its 40th Anniversary. The next year, a live, 10:45 am Sunday morning radio broadcast of worship services was added. In 2000, the church Plaza was completed, Stuart Briscoe retired as senior pastor, and his prot√©g√©, Mel Lawrenz, was installed as his successor. Stuart and Jill Briscoe were commissioned international ministers-at-large. In 2004, the International Center was established, a third Sunday service was added, and an 8:00 am live Sunday radio broadcast was added. In 2008, a grass activities area and the Mission Cafe coffee shop opened. In addition, the church has planted nine churches in the Milwaukee area: Eastbrook Church (1979), Hmong Alliance Church (1982), Lao Christian Church (1982), Westbrook Church (1983), Northbrook Church (1985), Meadowbrook Church (1989), Southbrook Church (1997), Centrobrook Church (1998), and Metrobrook Church (2005). Elmbrook also has global church partnerships with: Glennabey Church (Northern Ireland), Iglesia de LaPuerta Abierta (Buenos Aires, Argentina), Nairobi Chapel (Nairobi, Kenya), Covenant Evangelical Free Church (Singapore) and Jerusalem Alliance Church (Jerusalem, Israel). The church celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008. In early 2010, Lawrenz resigned to become Elmbrook's third Minister-at-Large and then associate pastor, Scott Arbeiter, was appointed lead pastor while a search was underway for Lawrenz's successor. Following Lawrenz stepping down from the role of senior pastor, Elmbrook began looking internally and externally for senior pastor candidates. On October 10, 2010, the church announced that Philip Griffin had been selected as Elmbrook's fifth senior pastor after an international search that lasted more than 18 months. Griffin previously served as the senior pastor at First Wesleyan Church of Battle Creek, Michigan, and he brought a passion for evangelism, a history of strong leadership and a desire to \\"reach the lost and grow the found.\\" Griffin's first year as Elmbrook's senior pastor saw significant changes in the organization and programming of Elmbrook, as he sought to consolidate and refresh ministries. On June 26, 2013, Elmbrook Church announced via their website that Sr Pastor Philip Griffin had resigned. Scott Arbeiter, lead pastor, acted as senior pastor as the search for a permanent senior pastor was conducted. Jason Webb was commissioned as the new senior pastor in October 2014. Pastor Jason was a member of Elmbrook's pastoral staff years earlier, then left to lead the launch of Brooklife Church in Mukwonago, Wisconsin. After successfully launching and leading Brooklife, he accepted the commission to become Elmbrook Church's senior pastor. Pastor Jason resigned in 2018, following multiple marital infidelities and promising to seek treatment for an unspecified addiction. In May 2016, the congregations of Elmbrook Church and Westbrook Church voted to merge into a single, multi-site congregation. The Westbrook Church site was renamed ‚ÄúElmbrook Church-Lake Country‚Äù. Currently, Elmbrook has 15 pastors on staff, more than 100 employees and supports over 100 missionaries all over the world, while averaging 6,000 people in attendance per week. Locally, Elmbrook Church has partnerships with James Place, a community outreach in Waukesha and Milwaukee, Wisconsin; BASICS; Community Warehouse; Feed My Sheep food and hospitality ministry; Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA); Hope Street; and Strong Links. Elmbrook also currently supports dozens of missionaries and mission organizations around the world and its yearly Harvestfest allows the congregation a chance to engage with its mission initiatives. Globally, Elmbrook has partnerships with House of Hope in Nicaragua, Potter's House in Guatemala, The Harbor in Russia, Hope School in South Sudan, Friends for Health, World Relief-Haiti, and The Congo Initiative. In Nov. 2018, the Council of Elders called Lee Heyward to begin serving as the Lead Pastor. Stuart Briscoe  Former pastor Stuart Briscoe was called as senior pastor of Elmbrook in 1970 after a banking career in England and an international preaching ministry under the auspices of the Torchbearers. During his pastorate Elmbrook grew tremendously and planted a number of churches in the local area while Briscoe continued his international teaching ministry. He has written more than 40 books and the media ministry, Telling the Truth, which he founded in 1971, continues to reach out daily around the world. In 2000, after serving for 30 years as Elmbrook's senior pastor, Stuart and his wife, Jill, embarked on new ministries as Elmbrook's Ministers-at-Large, concentrating on reaching out to pastors, missionaries and church leaders all over the world, while maintaining close ties with Elmbrook, their home church. Briscoe is credited with transforming Elmbrook from a church of a few hundred people to one of the largest in the country. Mel Lawrenz Briscoe's proteg√©, Mel Lawrenz, was the senior pastor of Elmbrook from 2000 to 2010, after serving under Briscoe's leadership for 20 years. He began serving at the church in 1980. Lawrenz received a B.A. in English from Carroll University (Carroll College then), a M.Div. from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and a Ph.D. in historical theology from Marquette University. He is the author of eight books. On March 18, 2009, Lawrenz announced that he would be stepping down as senior pastor. He resigned in early 2010 and was commissioned a minister-at- large. \\"No Regrets\\" Conference Elmbrook is one of the hosting churches for the, \\"No Regrets Conference,\\" a Wisconsin-statewide Christian men's conference with dozens of live host sites around the country. The conference is spearheaded by Elmbrook associate pastor Steve Sonderman.

Geography Surrounded by green hills and situated in the L√©mance valley on the borders of Bouriane and P√©rigord noir, it borders the departments of Dordogne and Lot. Ch√¢teau Ch√¢teau des Rois ducs (also known as Ch√¢teau de Sauveterre) is a fortified castle located above the village. It was built at the end of the thirteenth century by Edward I of England in a strategic position between P√©rigord and Agen. During the Hundred Years' War, it became a center-piece in the Franco-English war of attrition. It was burnt down in 1789 during the French Revolution. It was bought by aviator Jean Mermoz in 1936, a year before his death. The castle has been classified as historical monument since September 19, 2003. As of 2020, it is a private property and is not open to the public.  Prehistoric Museum SauveTerre Mus√©e de Pr√©histoire is a museum that exhibits collections from archaeological digs in the L√©mance valley, including part of the collection of L. Coulonges, a self-taught archaeologist who undertook excavations in the L√©mance valley in the 1920s. Sauveterre-La-Lemance is home to several archaeological sites. The museum holds walking tours to the Martinet site along the Lemance river as well as providing brochures for self-guided walks. In 1923, Laurence Coulonges discovered remains of a prehistoric culture between the Paleolithic and Neolithic period, somewhere between 7,000-9,500 years old. The first museum was installed by Coulonges on the first floor of the building, originally a girl's school. From 1972 onwards, further excavation of the archaeological sites renewed interest in the Fumel area. The current museum was inaugurated in 1994, particularly devoted to the Mesolithic period, in which men gradually passed from a society of hunter-gatherers to a way of life of producers and farmers. They have a year-round program of educational activities and tours for children as well as temporary exhibitions.

In 1816, while living in Leeds, Mudie met Robert Owen and quickly became a supporter of the latter's co-operative principles and ideas for social reform.G. Mudie, Letter to R.

Claeys, 'George Mudie: A Fragment of an Owenite Autobiography', in Bulletin: Society for the Study of Labour History, No. 45 (Autumn 1982), p. 15. = The Economist and Spa Fields = Mudie moved to London in 1820, where he became editor of The Sun newspaper.G. Claeys, Machinery, Money and the Millennium (Princeton University Press, 1987, p. 71 In August that year he addressed a meeting of printers at Mitchell's Assembly Rooms, where he outlined a plan, based on Owen's ideas, to form a community. The printers set up a committee, which included Henry Hetherington, to evaluate the scheme and its favourable report, produced in January 1821,R. Hunt, J. Shallard, J. Jones, G. Hinde, R.

G. Garnett, Co- operation and the Owenite socialist communities in Britain 1825-45 (Manchester University Press, 1972) p. 42 Although Mudie was fulsome in his praise for Owen, their respective conceptions of co-operation differed. Mudie played down Owen's interest in the formation of human character, concentrating on the practical advantages of communal living. He stressed the importance of communal self-help, rather than Owen's philanthropic approach. Above all, Mudie believed that the co-operative movement had to be based on sound economic principles, which, he argued, could not be found in the theories of established political economists, such as David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus. Mudie's articles in The Economist include critiques of laissez-faire capitalism and he was one of the earliest writers to suggest that the economy should be planned and regulated, instead of being left to the vagaries of market forces. In this respect, he held similar views to Ricardian socialists such as John Gray.G. Claeys, Machinery, Money and the Millennium (Princeton University Press, 1987, pp. 71-75 On 17 November 1821 Mudie announced that the Co-operative and Economical Society had rented several houses in Guildford Street East and Bagnigge Wells Road, Spa Fields, London,R.

Heavans Below: Utopian Experiments in England, 1560-1960 (London, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1961) p. 95 Ten months later Mudie commenced another, similar, publication: The Political Economist and Universal Philanthropist (January‚ÄìFebruary 1823).G. Claeys, Machinery, Money and the Millennium (Princeton University Press, 1987, p. 71 In this journal Mudie continued to attack orthodox political economy. In particular, he critiqued Ricardo's contention that the natural price of labour was the amount required to enable labourers merely to subsist. Mudie argued that the price of labour was artificial, not natural, because employers kept wages as low as they could, even below subsistence level. His own system of political economy, he said, was founded on two principles: > That Labour is the Source of Wealth. That the producers of Wealth are in > justice entitled to the enjoyment or disposal of all fruits, or productions > of their own industry.G. Claeys, Machinery, Money and the Millennium > (Princeton University Press, 1987, p. 71 The journal only lasted for two months. Several months later Mudie was forced by the proprietors of The Sun to either resign as its editor or abandon the community. He chose the latter and the Spa Fields community was dispersed.W.H.G. Armytage, Heavans Below: Utopian Experiments in England, 1560-1960 (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1961) p. 95 = Orbiston and Edinburgh = Mudie's next co-operative venture was in 1825 at Orbiston, near Motherwell, Scotland, where Abram Combe was creating a new Owenite community. Mudie's involvement, however, was brief and acrimonious. He invested all his money in the project but soon quarrelled with Combe, whom he accused of being both managerially incompetent and an \\"absolute dictator\\". He left the community, lost all his money and found himself \\"thrown destitute, with my large family, upon the world\\".G. Claeys, Machinery, Money and the Millennium (Princeton University Press, 1987, p. 80 He moved back to Edinburgh, where he would stay for the next six or so years. During this period he founded another co-operative society, the United Interests Society, addressed numerous meetings of trade societies and published another journal, The Advocate of the Working Classes (January‚ÄìApril 1827). The United Interests Society had around 600 members and opened its own bakery in South Hanover Street, but dissolved itself in 1827.G. Claeys, Machinery, Money and the Millennium (Princeton University Press, 1987, p. 80 Mudie temporarily ceased his co-operative activities and took up popular journalism. Commencing in September 1831, his publication The Edinburgh Cornucopia, which he later renamed The Cornucopia Britannica , was a magazine which sought to bring low-cost literature to a mass audience. It sold well at first but ceased publication in March 1832, after which Mudie moved back to London.G.

Garnett, Co-operation and the Owenite socialist communities in Britain 1825-45 (Manchester University Press, 1972) p. 139 His journal The Gazette of the Exchange Bazaars (September‚ÄìNovember 1832) was mainly concerned with explaining the theory of equitable exchange; and Mudie was highly critical of the operating principles adopted by Owen's National Equitable Labour Exchange.G. Claeys. \\"George Mudie and the Gazette of the Exchange Bazaars\\" in Bulletin: Society for the Study of Labour History, No. 42 (Spring 1981) Little is known about Mudie's activities during the mid-1830s. He attended trade society meetings and argued for the introduction of a national minimum wage.G. Claeys, Machinery, Money and the Millennium (Princeton University Press, 1987, p. 84. He also played a small part in the \\"War of the Unstamped\\" by helping the radical publisher Benjamin Cousins register a printing press in a false name, in order to avoid having Cousins' assets seized.P. Hollis, The Pauper Press: A Study in Working-Class Radicalism of the 1830s (Oxford University Press, 1970) pp. 161/2 In the late 1830s Mudie edited another journal: The Alarm Bell!, or Herald of the Spirit of Truth. This was written in response to the notorious \\"Marcus\\" pamphlets, which had proposed (possibly satirically) that population should be controlled by gassing the new-born children of the poor. Mudie accused \\"Marcus\\" of taking Malthus's theory of population to its logical conclusion and argued that Britain was capable of supporting five times its present population.G.

By 1848 he had moved to 23 Parr Street, Hoxton, London, from where he again offered his services to Owen, admitting that he had spent the last few years in poverty.G. Mudie, Letter to R.

Owen, however, rejected his offer. The following year, in response to the French Revolution of 1848, Mudie produced A Solution of the Portentous Enigma of Modern Civilization (London, 1849). In this, he criticised the French government for the way in which it had organised unemployed workers into \\"national workshops\\" .G.

History The territories of Aquitania and Gascony were highly desirable lands and in order to protect and also control the people living there a series of fortified villages, ‚Äúbastides‚Äù were founded from about 1229. Where Vianne now lies already existed a village, Vilalonga, with a mill and a dam on the river Ba√Øse. The village also had a church from the 12th century. The nearby village of Mongaillard was the seat of the Gontaud Birons, the local feudal lords. The village of Vilalonga belonged to Vianne of Gontaud Biron or Vianne of Gontaut Biron, one of the two daughters of Vital, lord of Montgaillard. On the death of her father Vianne had inherited the castle and its dependencies (including Vilalonga), the castle of Puch and the one of Gontaud. Vianne had a sad life, was married twice without producing any children and in 1281 in a convents she had founded in Condom she would die. However, in 1275 she had bequeathed all her properties to her nephew Jourdain de l'Isle. He had pledged his allegiance to Edward I, son of Eleanor of Provence who became king of England in 1272. To continue the policy of fortifying the area it was decided in 1284 to construct a bastide on the lands at Vilalonga and it was named after Vianne de Gontaud Biron. The 13th century was a costly time for the local lords. They were expected to provide soldiers for the English monarchy and its overseas wars and also enjoy a lavish lifestyle. Thus it was seen that part of the decision to construct these bastide villages was economic as well as with security in mind. In feudalism, the local population swore loyalty to a lord. These locals paid taxes (tithes) out of whatever they could produce and sell. A lord kept law and order: police, judge and jury all in one, enforced by his army. Farmers didn't make a lot of money, and mostly grew grain and raised enough cattle to live on, with only a little left over. Lords needed another way to finance their lavish lifestyles and the crusades, plus whatever demands the church also made for financial support. Thus the lords needed a way to generate more money than the tithe system could produce. The bastide was devised to solve this problem. The idea was to clear some land, build a fortified village and attract the local population to live there and work the expanse of land around it. This was often done by an agreement known as a ‚Äúpareatge‚Äù, a legal contract between two or more parties agreeing to develop the bastide for their mutual benefit. Frequently the pareage was between the local lord, in this case Jourdain de l‚ÄôIsle and a sovereign power, Edward 1 of England. The agreement set out the responsibilities of each party to the villagers and also what share of the profits from the markets and land taxes, etc. would go to each party. If the correct population density could be achieved (the hopeful part), this would attract merchants to the markets, who could also be taxed. The incentive for people to live in a bastide was release from direct taxation by the lord. Those who moved to a bastide became free men yet still enjoyed the protection of the lord's army. This was the beginning of the end of feudalism. The lord and the king could now make money through property taxes on those living in the bastide, and also sales taxes on the markets that took place there. The market was the centre of the village because it generated sales taxes. This is also why churches in bastides are normally located away from the centre; churches didn't generate revenue. The bastide was laid out on a grid because that made assessing property taxes easier and more equitable. The laws of the bastide said that trade could only take place in the market square, and the purpose of the covered central area was to protect the weighing and measuring devices of the lord's representative and tax collector. Started in 1284 and finished in 1287 Vianne is one of the most interesting bastides because of its formal plan and its well-preserved walls and gates. Its maps show building plots which were originally equal in size, i.e. about 11.70 metres in front by 23.40 metres at the sides (24 rasas by 48, the ‚Äúrasa‚Äù being a medieval unit of measure). Over an inside area of about 10 hectares, only part of the land was allotted to the first inhabitants and the space in the village was far from being wholly occupied by housing. The gardens have at all times taken up a lot of space. The overall structure included two road axes: one, North-South nearly 350 metres long, ran parallel with the Ba√Øse, the other, about 250 metres long, lies perpendicular to the first. Other streets of different widths ran parallel to each of these but none of them led to a village gate. So it can be seen that there were only four entrances. These main streets are 7.68 metres wide. The narrower streets were half as wide. Five round towers (defensive) and four square towers (exits and entrances) marked the 1250 metres of outside walls. The original walls were first built approximately four to five blocks of limestone high continuously around the village before the next level of four blocks was added and so on to reach the optimum height of between six and eight metres. However following renovation work most of the walls are only between four and five metres high. In some places the maximum height of six to eight metre walls can still be seen. All the blocks are between 20 and 28 cm in height and 25 to 45 cm in length. A rampart walk still exists in some place at about 3.5m above ground level. There are some arrow slits visible in the walls on the river side of the village. Today most of the buildings in the village date from the 19th and 20th centuries although a few exist from the 17th and 18th. The outside walls were extensively restored in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the towers on the river Ba√Øse side of the village has been removed and most of that wall replaced by houses. The towers originally were capped with wooden turrets and these have been replaced with stone. When the suspension bridge was built in the 1840s new entrances were made in the walls to allow for traffic through the village. At the northeast end of the village the road now bends to meet the bridge over the Ba√Øse. Jourdain de l‚ÄôIsle was not a popular lord. He was known to be a vicious soldier and very cruel to his local population. In 1313, he destroyed the church in Vianne after a row with the monks. He was executed in 1323 on the orders of then King, Edward III. During the Hundred Years' War, the French retook Vianne from the English in 1337. It was then retaken in 1340 by the English who again surrendered it to the French in 1342. Again retaken by the English it changed hands several times over the next hundred years before it was finally relinquished to the French crown in 1442. Today Vianne is well known for the glassmaking industry which developed over many years. A large factory was built outside the walls at the south-western end in the 1920s and this has gone through many changes. The old railway station is the workshop for a glass blowing craftsman and other craftspeople work in the village, e.g. a leather worker, a furniture restorer and a potter. The railway line now only handles freight traffic between Port-Sainte-Marie and N√©rac. The River Ba√Øse is well used by passenger boats, both private or from the bases at Le- Mas-d'Agenais, Buzet-sur-Ba√Øse and Condom. The Albret valley, a tourist area with N√©rac as its capital, is crossed by the Tenar√®ze - an ancient Roman road - and boasts a fortified mill, castles dating from the 13th, 14th and 17th centuries, other bastides and Romanesque churches scattered over hilly countryside partly covered by the Buzet vineyards. Vianne has fine restaurants and small shops and is a popular tourist stopover particularly in the summer with its evening market.

The new Bastide was built in the next four years and the King signed a contract in 1269 determining the legal statutes of the Villereal. In addition, Villereal was occupied by the English from 1279 to 1453. King Edward I of England signed the ‚ÄúCharte des Coutumes de la Cit√©‚Äù on April 20, 1288, which protected the inhabitants and set the rules of life in the village community. Due to this charter Saturday was fixed as the market day.  Structure  Villereal structure follows the basic plan of Bastides. It has 8 main streets, set at right angles, surround the large central square. The ‚Äúhalle‚Äù, the main market building is spacious and with an unusual wattle and upper storey.

In 2005, Anthem Pictures used Jaaska's Terminator artwork to create The Terminator: Hunters and Killers a unique \\"Digital Comic DVD\\". The product uses art from the original comic books combined with actors reading the dialog, to create a flowing story that does not have actual motion in the traditional sense of animation, but is not static, in that the screen moves across the panels, and focuses on elements considered important by the director. The end result is a comic that can be watched on a video screen as opposed to being read. Bill Jaaska died November 9, 2009 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

A call to the monitor function 'mcount' is inserted before each function call.Justin Thiel, An Overview of Software Performance Analysis Tools and Techniques: From GProf to DTrace (2006) \\"2.1.1 Overview of GProf\\" Sampling data is saved in 'gmon.out' or in 'progname.gmon' file just before the program exits, and can be analyzed with the '\`gprof\`' command-line tool. Several gmon files can be combined with '\`gprof -s\`' to accumulate data from several runs of a program. GPROF output consists of two parts: the flat profile and the call graph. The flat profile gives the total execution time spent in each function and its percentage of the total running time. Function call counts are also reported. Output is sorted by percentage, with hot spots at the top of the list. The second part of the output is the textual call graph, which shows for each function who called it (parent) and who it called (child subroutines).

Sampling is done by probing the target program's program counter at regular intervals using operating system interrupts (programmed via profil(2) or setitimer(2) syscalls). The resulting data is not exact, rather a statistical approximation. The amount of error is usually more than one sampling period. If a value is n times the sampling period, the expected error in the value is the square root of n sampling periods.Statistical Inaccuracy of Output gprof Profiling Tools on BG/P Systems , \\"Issues in Interpreting Profile Data\\", Argonne Leadership Computing Facility A typical sampling period is 0.01 second (10 milliseconds) or 0.001 second (1 ms) or in other words 100 or 1000 samples per second of CPU running time. In some versions, such as BSD, profiling of shared libraries can be limited because of restrictions of the profil function, which may be implemented as library function or as system call. There were analogous utility in glibc called 'sprof' to profile dynamic libraries.http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/qprof/ Gprof cannot measure time spent in kernel mode (syscalls, waiting for CPU or I/O waiting), and only user-space code is profiled.

The 204th is equipped with the C-17 Globemaster III. Overview The 204th Airlift Squadron is a unit of the 154th Wing. The unit is a classic associate unit with the 535th Airlift Squadron at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. It flies the C-17 Globemaster III, the newest, most flexible cargo aircraft to enter the airlift force. The C-17 is capable of rapid strategic delivery of troops and all types of cargo to main operating bases or directly to forward bases in the deployment area. The aircraft can perform tactical airlift and airdrop missions and can also transport litters and ambulatory patients during aeromedical evacuations when required. History Established in 1994 to provide the Hawaii Air National Guard a theater airlift capability and to support joint exercises in Hawaii with Army and Marine Corps units. The squadron supports operational training, provides paratroop and tactical air drop capability, and deliver relief supplies following natural disasters. The last C-130 Hercules aircraft scheduled to leave the Hawaii Air National Guard sits in the flight line during a farewell ceremony by the 204th Airlift Squadron at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, 8 Feb. 2006. Since its establishment, squadron C-130 crews have made airdrops over India, shuttled military crews involved in the search for missing in action servicemen in New Zealand and Cambodia, and have even transported to Oahu 30 to 40 people arrested on neighbor island drugs raids. In April 1999, the 204th Airlift Squadron was awarded the Air Force's Outstanding Unit Award for the period of 14 July 1996 to 13 July 1998. While providing airlift support during the exercise Balitakan 2000, in February 2000, the 204th Airlift Squadron, HIANG, delivered books and school supplies to Virgen Delos Remedios Elementary School, Angeles City, Philippines, while here supporting Balikatan 2000. After more than a decade the C-130s were the Hawaii National Guard's workhorse‚Äîthe main means of moving supplies, soldiers, airmen, and even prisoners between the islands. In 2008, the unit was upgraded to the Air Force's latest jet cargo plane, the C-17 Globemaster III. The eight C-17s are part of a 190-member unit manned by active Air Force personnel from the 535th Airlift Squadron and the Hawaii Air Guard's 204th Airlift Squadron. When established in 2008, it was the first active joint Air Force and Air National Guard unit outside of the mainland. In July 2018 a C-17 of the squadron collected 55 cases of human remains from Wonsan in North Korea. It is thought that these are remains of US or possibly other UN servicemen from the Korean War. The C-17 then flew to Osan Air Base in South Korea. =Lineage= * Established as 204th Airlift Squadron and allotted to Hawaii ANG in 1994 : Received federal recognition and activated on 1 August 1994 =Assignments= * 154th Operations Group, 1 August 1994 ‚Äì Present =Stations= * Hickam Air Force Base, 1 August 1994 : Re-designated: Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, 1 January 2010-Present =Aircraft= * C-130A Hercules, 1989-1994 * C-130H2 Hercules, 1994-2006 * C-17A Globemaster III, 2006‚ÄìPresent References * Rogers, B.

History  This pit was opened in the 1860s by John Brogden and Sons. In 1872 Brogdens merged with the Llynfi Coal and Iron Company Ltd to make the Llynfi, Tondu and Ogmore Coal and Iron Company. This failed in 1878. Eventually the mine was taken over by North's Navigation Ltd. . They had to work the difficult geology near the southern outcrop. Closed in 1904, the colliery is remembered for a mining accident that occurred at 8.20 am on 26 August 1892 as 146 men and boys were working within the mine. This was the day of the annual St Mary Hill Fair and a fine day with everyone looking forward to a day of relaxation, but they all heard the explosion and knew immediately what it meant. The explosion was apparently caused by a hole in one of the workers' Davy lamps. Rescue attempts were hampered by roof falls, but by 4pm 42 miners had been brought out alive, some of whom died later of their injuries. The final death toll was 112 men and boys.David Owen (2002) South Wales Collieries, Volume 3, pages 36/7 provides much more detail.

Originally a family of priests who served at the Suwa Grand Shrine, by the Kamakura period it thrived as a prominent warrior clan with close ties to the shogunate. Surviving the fall of both the Kamakura shogunate and the Southern Imperial Court which it supported, its feud with local rival clans, and frequent clashes with its neighbor in Kai, the Takeda clan, during the Sengoku period (which ended in the extinction of the main family), the clan split into two branches by the Edo period: one ruling the Suwa Domain of Shinano as daimy≈ç, with the other continuing to serve as priests of Suwa Grand Shrine. Ancestry Suwa Daimy≈çjin as depicted in the Butsuz≈çzui (originally published 1690). Although the Suwa clan, who were the high priests of one of the component shrines of Suwa Grand Shrine, traditionally regarded themselves to be the descendants of the shrine's deity, Suwa Daimy≈çjin (also known as Takeminakata), the clan's actual historical origins are shrouded in mystery. While the Kojiki portrays Takeminakata as a son of the god ≈åkuninushi driven to exile in Suwa after his defeat at the hands of a messenger sent by the gods of heaven to claim the land held by his father in the name of the goddess Amaterasu, other (often conflicting) myths regarding the god of Suwa Shrine portray him in a different light. In some stories, Suwa Daimy≈çjin is a conqueror who subdued a number of local deities, one of them being the god Moreya, who is subsequently said to have become the ancestor of the Moriya (ÂÆàÁü¢Ê∞è) clan, one of the priestly families who served the Suwa lineage of high priests.Moriya, Sanae (1991).

Ë´èË®™Âè≤Âπ¥Ë°® (Suwa Shinenpy≈ç). Nagano: Suwa Ky≈çikukai. p. 11. Although this boy, who is said to have been the founding ancestor of the clan, is traditionally claimed to be a semi-legendary priest from the Heian period named Arikazu (ÊúâÂì°), one genealogical record of the Suwa clan discovered in 1884Ihara (2008). p. 261. portrays Arikazu as a descendant of an earlier priest named Kumako (Á•ûÂ≠ê or ÁÜäÂ≠ê).≈åh≈çri-bon Jinshi Keizu (Â§ßÁ•ùÊú¨ Á•ûÊ∞èÁ≥ªÂõ≥), cited in Seemingly corroborating this information is a genealogy of the Aso (ÈòøËòá) clan of Aso Shrine in Kyushu, in which Kumako (Á•ûÂ≠ê), also named Otoei (‰πôÈ†¥), is recorded as a son of the Yamato-appointed provincial governor (kuni no miyatsuko) of Shinano Province during the time of Emperor Y≈çmei (585-587), Mase-gimi (È∫ªËÉåÂêõ), a.k.a. Iotari (‰∫îÁôæË∂≥).Ihon Asoshi Keizu (Áï∞Êú¨ÈòøËòáÊ∞èÁ≥ªÂõ≥), cited in Kanai (1982). p. 109. Recent reappraisals of these two genealogies (particularly that concerning the Aso genealogy), however, have cast doubt on their authenticity and reliability as historical sources.Ihara (2008). pp. 260-262. For a contrary viewpoint, cf. Apart from these candidates, the clan has also been claimed to descend from the Seiwa Genji via Minamoto no Mitsuyasu (one of the sons of Minamoto no Tsunemoto). The Suwa ≈åh≈çri Kamisha Maemiya, one of the two main shrines that comprise the Upper Shrine of Suwa. The Upper Shrine's high priest or ≈åh≈çri resided in this area during the medieval period. In antiquity, the Suwa clan produced the Upper Shrine (‰∏äÁ§æ Kamisha) of Suwa's high priest known as the ≈åh≈çri (Â§ßÁ•ù 'great priest', old orthography: „Åä„Åª„ÅØ„Åµ„Çä Ohohafuri; also rendered as ≈åhafuri), who was worshiped as the living avatar of the shrine's deity during his period in office. The ≈åh≈çri, who traditionally assumed the position at a young age (ideally between the ages of eight to fifteen), was assisted by five priests headed by the Jinch≈çkan (Á•ûÈï∑ÂÆò) of the Moriya clan, who oversaw the Upper Shrine's religious rituals, many of which are centered around the worship of agricultural and fertility god(s) called Mishaguji. The Jinch≈çkan was believed to have the prerogative to summon the Mishaguji onto individuals and objects whenever its presence was called for.Moriya, Sanae (1991).

In fact, it was due to the Jinch≈çkan summoning the Mishaguji onto the ≈åh≈çri during the investiture ceremony that the latter became a living deity.Miyasaka (1987). p. 29. =Investiture ceremony= The full rite of investiture into the office of ≈åh≈çri as practiced in the late medieval period involved the candidate first undergoing a twenty-two day period of strict ritual purification in the Maemiya (ÂâçÂÆÆ 'old shrine'), one of the Upper Shrine's two component shrines. During the day of the ceremony itself, the Jinch≈çkan led the candidate by the hand before a sacred tree west of the G≈çdono (Á•ûÊÆø), the ≈åh≈çri's residence during his term located west of the Maemiya, under which was a flat rock known as the kanameishi (Ë¶ÅÁü≥ 'keystone'). During the ceremony, this rock is surrounded a makeshift enclosure or hut and a mat of reeds was placed over it for the boy to sit on.Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 722. Inside this enclosure, the Jinch≈çkan dressed the boy in full ritual attire: traditional makeup (oshiroi, ohaguro, beni and mayuzumi), a dull yellow-green sokutai, a hakama, and a crown (kanmuri).Fujimori, Akira (1991). ≈åh≈çri sokui no kesh≈ç-d≈çgu (Â§ßÁ•ùÂç≥‰Ωç„ÅÆÂåñÁ≤ßÈÅìÂÖ∑).

The Jinch≈çkan then summoned the Mishaguji (who as a nature spirit was believed to manifest on rocks and trees) to the kanameishi via secret incantations. Via the rock, the Mishaguji was then believed to enter the child's body, thereby turning him into a living god.Miyasaka (1992). p. 53.Miyasaka (1987). p. 28-29. The Uchi-no-mitama-den (ÂÜÖÂæ°ÁéâÊÆø) After being consecrated, the ≈åh≈çri visited the various shrines of the Upper Shrine complex. In another shrine in the Maemiya area, the Uchi-no-mitama-den (ÂÜÖÂæ°ÈúäÊÆø), wherein was kept the sacred treasures of the Upper Shrine (a bell, a mirror, a bit and a saddle) that were supposedly brought to the region by Suwa Daimy≈çjin himself, the ≈åh≈çri made a ritual declaration (Áî≥Á´ã m≈çshitate) that he has become the god's new 'body' and will henceforth avoid impurity.Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 696, 722-723. As time went on the ritual became increasingly simplified and later, was supposedly even omitted altogether, with the ≈çh≈çri simply assuming the position without any ceremony. =Role= During his term, the incumbent ≈åh≈çri was treated as the physical manifestation of Suwa Daimy≈çjin. In 1186, Minamoto no Yoritomo officially recognized the ≈åh≈çri as the god's incarnation in a letter to his subordinates, declaring that the ≈åh≈çri's orders are those of the god himself.Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 696. The ≈åh≈çri was expected to live a life of ritual purity and was also forbidden to step outside the boundaries of Suwa region under pain of divine punishment.Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 695. During his term of office, the ≈åh≈çri originally resided in a building near the Suwa Maemiya known as the G≈çdono (Á•ûÊÆø). Reflecting its being the residence of an incarnate deity, the Maemiya area and its vicinity was known during the Middle Ages as the G≈çbara (Á•ûÂéü), the 'god's field'. Should an incumbent ≈åh≈çri die while in office, his corpse was immediately brought before the Uchi-no-mitama-den where he was ceremonially retired - the idea being that the ≈åh≈çri's spirit was temporarily deposited in the shrine until a new candidate was chosen.Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). pp. 718-719. Originally, the deceased priest was buried wearing hunting attire (such as that supposedly worn by Suwa Daimy≈çjin) and with hair and beard kept unshaven.Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. pp. 719. However, in 1465, with the death of then ≈åh≈çri Yorinaga (È†ºÈï∑), the local priesthood began to adopt the Buddhist custom of cremation. By the early 17th century, the ≈åh≈çri's residence was moved from the Maemiya to a place in what is now Nakasu, Suwa City. History =From the Heian period to the Sengoku period= In the meantime, other male members of the clan aside from the ≈çh≈çri - who cannot step outside the boundaries of the region, as well as come into contact with sources of impurity such as the flesh and blood of men or horses - began to pursue military careers. One of the first recorded warriors from the clan was Tamenaka (ÁÇ∫‰ª≤), a son of then ≈çh≈çri Tamenobu (ÁÇ∫‰ø°). Tamenaka served under Minamoto no Yoshiie during the Zenkunen War (1051-1063) under the orders of his father, who could not participate himself due to his priestly status. He then also served again under Yoshiie in the later Gosannen War of the 1080s, this time despite opposition from his family due to him already inheriting the position of ≈çh≈çri from Tamenobu in the interim between the two wars. Tamenaka's eventual suicide out of shame after his subordinates had a violent quarrel with Minamoto no Yoshimitsu's men during a feast held by the latter was considered to be divine punishment for his violation of the ban.Suwa Ky≈çikukai (1938). pp. 23-24. Due to the circumstances of his father's death, Tamenaka's son, Tamemori (ÁÇ∫Áõõ) did not inherit the office of ≈çh≈çri, it instead passing in succession to Tamenaka's three younger brothers, two of whom died within mere days of their investiture. It would be the youngest brother, Tamesada (ÁÇ∫Ë≤û), who would turn out to successfully pass down the priesthood to his progeny. By the Kamakura period, the clan - now renowned as being both a priestly and a warrior clan - rose to national prominence as vassals (gokenin) of the shogunate and later, flourished greatly under the patronage of the H≈çj≈ç clan. The clan's fortunes waned with the fall of the Kamakura shogunate and the defeat of the Southern Imperial Court (which the clan supported) during the Nanboku-ch≈ç period. During the Muromachi period, the Suwa were involved both in a feud with the Kanasashi clan of the Shimosha which supported the Northern Court, and interclan strife between the head family (ÊÉ£È†òÂÆ∂ s≈çry≈ç-ke) and the ≈çh≈çri-ke (Â§ßÁ•ùÂÆ∂), a branch of the clan that had come to assume the priestly duties. With the defeat of the Kanasashi and the head family's reattainment of the position of ≈çhori, the clan became a regional power, clashing with the Takeda clan - originally their allies - during the Sengoku period. The clan again suffered a setback with Suwa Yorishige's defeat in the hands of Takeda Shingen (who was, ironically, a staunch devotee of Suwa- my≈çjin) in 1542 and with his suicide in 1544, the extinction of the main family; his cousin Yoritada (Ë´èË®™È†ºÂø†, 1536-1606), who succeeded Yorishige's younger brother Yoritaka (Ë´èË®™È†ºÈ´ò, 1528-1542) as ≈çh≈çri, was spared. After the Takeda was destroyed by an alliance of Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, Yoritada allied himself with the latter, who eventually reinstated Yoritada in his family domain in 1601. =Edo period onwards= Chino City, Nagano. Yoritada's eldest son, Yorimizu (È†ºÊ∞¥, 1571-1641) became the first daimy≈ç to rule Suwa Domain, with the office of ≈çh≈çri passing down to his fourth son, Yorihiro (È†ºÂ∫É). With this, the clan effectively split into two branches: the daimy≈ç line and the ≈çh≈çri line. To distinguish themselves from the daimy≈ç line, the priestly line altered one of the Chinese characters of their surname (from Ë´èË®™ to Ë´èÊñπ). All in all, ten generations served as daimy≈ç of Suwa Domain until the abolition of the han system during the Meiji period. Meanwhile, the establishment of State Shinto abolished the tradition of hereditary succession among Shinto priesthood, including that of Suwa Grand Shrine. Local clans such as the Suwa lost control of the shrine's traditional priestly offices (which in turn became defunct) as government appointees began to manage the shrine, which passed under state control.

During the 1890s and early 1900s it organised numerous sports including athletics, cycling, field hockey, fencing, croquet and swimming. However it is perhaps best known for being the principal governing body of both football and rugby union until it was effectively replaced by the French Football Federation and the French Rugby Federation. The USFSA rejected any form of professionalism and were strong advocates of amateur sport. As well as contributing to the growth of sport in France, the USFSA also helped pioneer the development of international sport. Among its founding members were Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic Games. In 1900, together with the Union V√©locip√©dique de France, it was also one of two federations that represented France at the inaugural meeting of the Union Cycliste Internationale. Then in 1904 Robert Gu√©rin, secretary of the USFSA football committee, was one of the principal movers behind the foundation of FIFA. He also served as its first president. History =Foundation= Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games, also helped found the USFSA. At various times he served as the federation's president and secretary general On 29 December 1885 Georges de Saint-Clair, the secretary-general of Racing Club de France and delegates from Stade Fran√ßais had formed the Union des Soci√©t√©s Fran√ßaises de Course a Pied. Then on 1 June 1888 Pierre de Coubertin, with the support of Jules Simon and Henri Didon, formed the Comit√© pour la Propagation des Exercises Physiques. This group was also known as the Comit√© Jules Simon. The USFSA was founded in November 1890 when these two groups merged. Initially the USFSA was centred in Paris but its membership soon expanded to include sports clubs from throughout France.The Official History of the Olympic Games and the IOC- Athens to Beijing, 1894‚Äì2008: David Miller (2008)Origins of the French League by Fran√ßois Mazet and Fr√©d√©ric Pauron on the RSSSF =Influence on Olympic Games= In 1891 when the USFSA organised its first athletics championship, Henri Didon, as honorary president, announced that the organisation's motto would be Citius, Altius, Fortius (Faster, Higher, Stronger). In 1924 this motto would be adopted by the Olympic movement. The Olympic symbol of five interlinking rings was also based on a design used by the USFSA. Teams representing the organisation wore a uniform based on the colours of the flag of France. This included a white shirt with two interlinking rings, one red and one blue. The two rings represented the two groups that had merged to form the USFSA while the Olympic version represented five continents. Pierre de Coubertin also hoped that the USFSA would be responsible for organising the 1900 Paris Olympics. However a dispute, which saw de Coubertin resign as USFSA secretary general in April 1899, meant this never happened =Rugby union= On 20 March, 1892 the USFSA organised the first ever French rugby union championship, a one off game between Racing Club de France and Stade Fran√ßais. The game was refereed by Pierre de Coubertin and saw Racing win 4‚Äì3. Racing were awarded the Bouclier de Brennus, which is still awarded to the winners of the French championship today. The trophy was the idea of de Coubertin, who commissioned Charles Brennus, a member of the USFSA and a professional engraver, to design it.The Story of The Brennus (Top 14) Championship Trophy by James Harrington, 14 May 2014 =Football= 1900 Olympic Games. The players are wearing the distinct USFSA logo featuring the two interlinked rings. This design later inspired the Olympic symbol In 1894 the USFSA also organised the first recognised French football championship. The first competition featured just four Paris teams and was organised on a knockout basis with Standard Athletic Club beating White Rovers 2‚Äì0 after a replay. However, by 1896 it featured a league with nine teams and after 1899 the winners of a Paris League played off against the champions of other French regions and cities. In 1899 Le Havre AC became the first club from outside Paris to be declared French football champions.Football in France, a statistical record 1894‚Äì2003: Alex Graham (2004) In 1900 the USFSA sent players from Parisian Club Fran√ßais to represent France at the 1900 Summer Olympics.Games of the II.

They held Belgium to a 3‚Äì3 draw in Brussels In the same year, Robert Gu√©rin, secretary of the USFSA football committee, was also one of the principal movers behind the foundation of FIFA. He also served as its first president. However the USFSA did not have a monopoly on organising football in France. Between 1896 and 1907 the F√©d√©ration des Soci√©t√©s Athl√©tiques Professionnelles de France (FSAPF), who as their name suggests advocated professionalism, also organised a championship. Then in 1905 a rival organisation the F√©d√©ration Gymnastique et Sportive des Patronages de France (FGSPF), led by Charles Simon and Henri Delaunay and supported by the Catholic Church, also began organising competitions. In 1906 the F√©d√©ration Cycliste et Amateur de France (FCAF), a forerunner of the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Cyclisme also began to organise a football championship. In 1907 the FGSPF and the FCAF, together with several regional organisations that also organised football formed the Comit√© Fran√ßais Interf√©d√©ral (CFI). The CFI organised the Troph√©e de France which would challenge the USFSA equivalent, the Coupe National, as the recognised French championship. In 1907 the USFSA fell out with FIFA when the latter refused to admit the (English) Amateur Football Association. FIFA only recognised one national association per country, and so stood by the (English) Football Association, whereupon the USFSA left FIFA. They were replaced as France's representative by the CFI. As a result, they also lost the right to select the national team. By 1913, however, the USFSA football committee had also become a CFI affiliate and in 1919 the CFI was reorganised as the French Football Federation. 1919 was also the last year that the USFSA organised the Coupe National as a national football championship.

Despite poor handling characteristics it was put into service by Austria-Hungary, where some aircraft served until the end of the war.  Development and design  Ernst Heinkel chief designer of the Hansa und Brandenburgische Flugzeug-Werke developed the KD in 1916 to meet the requirements of the Austro-Hungarian Air Force (Kaiserliche und K√∂nigliche Luftfahrtruppen or K.u.K. Luftfahrtruppen). It was a single seat, single engined biplane, of wooden construction, with plywood fuselage skinning and fabric wing skins. The wings featured an unusual \\"Star-Strutter\\" arrangement of interplane struts, where four Vee struts joined in the centre of the wing bay to result in a \\"star\\" arrangement. The interplane struts themselves were steel tubes.Green and Swanborough 1994, p.83. The KD had a deep fuselage, which gave a poor forward view for the pilot and tended to blanket the small rudder, giving poor lateral stability and making recovery from spins extremely difficult.Gray and Thetford 1962, p.64. Armament was a single Schwarzlose machine gun, which owing to difficulties in synchronising the Schwarzlose, was fitted in a fairing on the upper wing, firing over the propeller.Williams and Gustin 2003, p.62 Despite these handling problems, the aircraft was ordered by Austro-Hungary as the D.I. A total of 122 D.Is were built, with 50 built by Hansa-Brandenburg in Germany - powered by 110 kW (150 hp) Austro-Daimler engines - while a further 72 were built under license by Ph√∂nix in Vienna, powered by 138 kW (185 hp) Austro- Daimler engines.

Less than a year later, the 104th was mobilized in anticipation of World War II. In personnel, if not in official lineage, the 104th Fighter Squadron can trace its origins to 1920 when the Flying Club of Baltimore was organized for former World War I Army Air Service reserve officers of that city. This club became part of the Maryland National Guard in 1921 when Maryland formed one of the nation's first post-war flying units with the creation of the 1st Observation Squadron in Baltimore which received federal recognition on 29 June 1921. Maryland became the fifth state to have a post- World War I National Guard aviation unit. The 1st Observation Squadron (a state designation) was re-designated the 104th Squadron (Observation) under the federal numbering system. At the time, the number 104 was widely used to designate combat support units in the Maryland National Guard, including the 104th Medical Regiment and the 104th Military Police Battalion. The 104th became the first post-World War I United States National Guard unit to be equipped with its own aircraft, 13 Curtiss JN-4 Jennies, which it flew until 1923. Initially assigned as division aviation for the 29th Infantry Division, the unit operated out of Baltimore's Logan Field. In addition to Jennies, the 104th flew a variety of other aircraft during the interwar period, almost all of them two-seat biplanes. Conducted annual summer training at various locations to include Langley Field, VA; Shepard Field, Martinsburg, WV; Middletown Air Depot, PA; and at Detrick Field, Frederick, MD. =World War II= At the outset of World War II the 104th became part of the Antisubmarine Patrol used along the East Coast. Initially operating out of the Fort Dix Army Airfield, squadron was moved to the Atlantic City Municipal Airport, as part of the 59th Observation Group using O-46 and O-47 aircraft fling coastal patrol missions. On 18 October 1942, the 104th was inactivated and its personnel and aircraft transferred to the 517th Bombardment Squadron. The 517th was soon moved to Langley Field, Virginia, where it was re-designated as the 12th Antisubmarine Squadron and equipped with B-18 Bolo, and later B-24 Liberator and B-25 Mitchell bombers configured for antisubmarine attack missions. By this time most of the original Maryland National Guard members had been transferred elsewhere as individual replacements, although a handful were still serving with the unit when it deployed to England in 1943, by which time the 517th Bomb Squadron had been redesignated the 859th Bombardment Squadron, part of the 492d Bombardment Group, Eighth Air Force, a B-24 Liberator group. There is no official lineage however, between the 104th Observation Squadron and the 859th Bombardment Squadron. Meanwhile, the 104th Observation Squadron was reactivated with the 59th Observation Group. The squadron was redesignated as the 104th Reconnaissance Squadron (Fighter) on 1 March 1943. Equipped with P-39 Airacobras, the squadron was assigned to the 59th Reconnaissance Group, III Fighter Command. Its mission was to train newly graduated pilots from AAF flight training schools to fly single-engine fighter planes as a Replacement Training Unit (RTU). In August 1943, the squadron was redesignated as the 489th Fighter Squadron. However, those changes were administrative in nature, the mission of the squadron remaining the same. The squadron was inactivated and disbanded on 1 May 1944 as part of an Air Force reorganization of its training program. The squadron's training mission subsequently was carried out by \\"Squadron B\\", Thomasville Replacement Training Unit. With the end of the war, Thomasville AAF and all of its assigned units were inactivated on 30 September 1945. =Maryland Air National Guard= 104th Fighter Squadron ‚Äì F-47 Thunderbolts 1947 The wartime 489th Fighter Squadron was reconstituted on 21 June 1945 and re-designated as the 104th Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the Maryland Air National Guard on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Harbor Field, Baltimore, Maryland, and was extended federal recognition on 17 August 1946 by the National Guard Bureau. The 104th Fighter Squadron continued the lineage of the 489th Fighter Squadron and all predecessor units. It was initially equipped with F-47D Thunderbolts. Air Defense Command U.S. Air Force Col. John F.R. Scott, a pilot with the Maryland Air National Guard, prepares to board a North American F-86H-10-NH Sabre (s/n 53-1397) of the 104th Tactical Fighter Squadron. The squadron was one of the first in the Air National Guard and was operationally gained by the Air Defense Command First Air Force. As the ANG command and control echelons were formed, the 104th came under the operational control of the PA ANG 53d Fighter Wing, although administrative control was retained by the Maryland ANG. With the surprise invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950, and the regular military's complete lack of readiness, most of the Air National Guard was federalized placed on active duty. The Maryland Air National Guard was not federalized, however its aircraft were replaced by very long distance F-51H Mustangs in 1951 to better carry out its air defense mission. By 1955 the Mustangs were at the end of their operational lifetime, and the Air Force issued a directive to ADC to replace all of its interceptor force with Jet Aircraft. As a result, the 104th entered the jet age and received Korean War veteran F-86E Sabres to replace its propeller-driven Mustangs, which were retired. However, Baltimore Harbor Field was unsuitable for jet aircraft due to the length of its runway, and the squadron was forced to temporarily base its jet aircraft at Andrews AFB, and later at Friendship Airport (now BWI Airport), while it looked for a new home. Eventually, the squadron relocated to Glenn L. Martin Company Airport on 1 July 1957 whose longer runway was necessary to support jet operations.

The F-86H was a fighter-bomber version of the Sabre designed for TAC and was transferred to the ANG by TAC units being upgraded to the F-100 Super Sabre. The air defense of Baltimore and Washington, however, was retained as a secondary mission and the squadron remained under the administrative control of the PA ANG 111th Air Defense Wing, the successor unit to the 53d Fighter Wing. On 10 November 1958 the squadron was re-designated as a Tactical Fighter Squadron. The 104th flew the F-86H for over a decade, remaining in service until well after the United States had committed itself to the Vietnam war. However, no F-86Hs ever went overseas to participate in that conflict, the fighter-bomber mission in Vietnam being flown by F-100s, F-105s and F-4C Phantom IIs. On 1 October 1962, the 104th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 175th Tactical Fighter Group was federally recognized and activated by the National Guard Bureau. The 104th TFS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 175th Headquarters, 175th Material Squadron, 175th Combat Support Squadron, and the 175th USAF Dispensary. With the formation of the 175th TFG, all administration of the unit by the 111th ADW ended. On 13 May 1968 the 175th Tactical Fighter Group was federalized and ordered to active service. It was transferred to Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico along with the NY ANG 139th Tactical Fighter Squadron and 174th Tactical Fighter Squadron as well as the 104th TFS. At Cannon AFB, the Group's mission was to act as a filler unit for the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing which were deployed to the Vietnam War. At Cannon, the squadron trained active Air Force pilots in forward air controller duties. The unit did not deploy overseas. The units were returned to New York and Maryland state control on 20 December 1968 when the TAC 4429th Combat Crew Training Squadron was activated with regular active-duty Air Force personnel. In 1970 the F-86H Sabres were transferred after being with the 104th TFS for thirteen years. The 104th was one of the last ANG units to fly the F-86. The Sabres, however, were not retired, but instead transferred to the United States Navy which used them both as target drones and as MiG simulators for TOP GUN aggressor training. The F-86H had a similar size, shape, and performance as the MiG-17 fighter then being encountered over North Vietnam, and many a Navy F-4 pilot was \\"killed\\" by a F-86H Sabre during these mock battles. A-10 Thunderbolt II assigned to the 104th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron, assigned to the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing taking off at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, 28 June 2012. In return, the 104th TFS received Cessna A-37 Dragonfly ground-attack aircraft. In the Vietnam War, the A-37 was a very effective ground support aircraft that was simple to operate, maintain and fly. The mission of the 104th was to train in the aircraft to support Air Force and Army special forces personnel and units. In 1974, after the end of American participation in Vietnam, the unit began supporting the Military Assistance Program (MAP) by supplying training to Latin American Air Forces. In addition, in the OA-37 configuration, the aircraft was used as a Forward Air Control (FAC) aircraft, that replaced the aging O-2 Skymaster. In the OA-37 configuration, the aircraft was equipped with small rocket pods, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking. In 1979, the 175th was the first Air National Guard unit to receive the A-10 Thunderbolt II ground support aircraft. The 104th received brand new A-10A Thunderbolt II attack aircraft from the factory in Hagerstown, Maryland. The unit continues to fly the latest version (A-10C) of the famed tank killer to this day. Modern era Early in the 1990s with the declared end of the Cold War and the continued decline in military budgets, the Air Force restructured to meet changes in strategic requirements, decreasing personnel, and a smaller infrastructure. The 175th adopted the new USAF \\"Objective Organization\\" in early 1992, with the word \\"tactical\\" being eliminated from its designation and becoming the 175th Fighter Group. Tactical Air Command was inactivated on 1 June, being replaced by the new Air Combat Command (ACC). A 104th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron A-10 Thunderbolt II sits on the aircraft ramp ar Bagram Airfield, in Afghanistan, 2012 On 15 June 1996, in accordance with the Air Force \\"One Wing, One Base\\" directive, the units of the 135th Airlift Group and 175th Fighter Wing merged to form the 175th Wing. The 175th Wing became a composite organization with an Air Combat Command-gained fighter unit, an Air Mobility Command-gained airlift unit, a United States Air Forces in Europe-gained civil engineer flight, and, from 2006 to 2016, a network warfare squadron. In mid-1996, the Air Force, in response to budget cuts, and changing world situations, began experimenting with Air Expeditionary organizations. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix Active-Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard elements into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying as \\"Provisional\\" as in the 1991 Gulf War, Expeditionary units are composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation. Following the terrorist attack of 11 September 2001, members of the 175th Wing repeatedly volunteered or have been mobilized to take part in the Global War on Terrorism. From January to June 2003, the 104th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron was formed and deployed to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, where it flew strikes against Taliban and al Qaeda forces and earned the distinction of being the longest-deployed Air National Guard fighter squadron at Bagram. =Lineage= 104th Observation Squadron emblem, 1920s 1994 Operation Deny Flight patch Operation Iraqi Freedom deployment patch, 2006 * Constituted in the National Guard in 1921 as the 104th Squadron (Observation) and allotted to the state of Maryland : Organized and Federally recognized on 29 June 1921 : Re-designated 104th Observation Squadron on 25 January 1923 : Ordered into active service on 3 February 1941 : Re-designated: 104th Observation Squadron (Light) on 13 January 1942 : Re-designated: 104th Observation Squadron on 4 July 1942 : Inactivated on 18 October 1942 * Activated on 1 March 1943 : Re-designated: 104th Reconnaissance Squadron (Fighter) on 2 April 1943 : Re-designated: 489th Fighter Squadron on 11 August 1943 : Disbanded on: 1 May 1944. * Reconstituted on 21 June 1945 : Re- designated: 104th Fighter Squadron and allotted to Maryland ANG on 24 May 1946 : Extended federal recognition on 17 August 1946 : Re-designated: 104th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in Aug 1951 : Re-designated: 104th Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 1 December 1952 : Re-designated: 104th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in Jun 1956 : Re-designated: 104th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 10 November 1958 : Federalized and ordered to active service on: 13 May 1968 : Released from active duty and returned to Maryland control, 20 December 1968 : Re-designated: 104th Fighter Squadron on 15 March 1992 : Components designated as: 104th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron when deployed as part of an Air and Space Expeditionary unit after June 1996. =Assignments= * Maryland National Guard (divisional aviation, 29th Division), 29 June 1921 * Relieved on 15 February 1929 from assignment to the 29th Division.

The 135th was active as a flying organization from 10 September 1955 to 30 September 2013. After 2013, it remained active but without assigned personnel or aircraft. In 2014, the Maryland Air National Guard requested the unit be reorganized and redesignated as the 135th Intelligence Squadron, and this request was approved by the National Guard Bureau effective 1 May 2016. Mission Operated combat-ready aircrew and aircraft to mobilize, deploy and provide intra- theater C-27J aircraft in support of U.S. interests worldwide. Supported theater commanders‚Äô requirements for combat delivery capability through tactical airland/airdrop operations and humanitarian aeromedical evacuations. Heraldry Symbolism: Ultramarine blue and golden yellow are the Air Force colors and symbolize that the unit is a part of the Air Force. The escutcheon portrays the coat of arms of the State of Maryland and signifies the home location of the unit. The crossed jousting lances reflect the military preparedness of the squadron and allude the Maryland state sport. Background: Designed by Lt Col Ronald James and approved for the 135th Tactical Airlift Squadron on 3 October 1990. Re-designated for the 135th Airlift Squadron in 1992. The motto, \\"Baltimore's Best\\" was suggested by Master Sgt. Lee Cherry and arose from the unit having been recognized by the Baltimore Is Best Committee on 18 February 1987. This insignia superseded one approved by the Air Force for the squadron in October 1960. History =Special operations= Members of 135th Air Supply Group with their C-46 Commando, 1955. The Maryland Air National Guard's introduction to the world of special operations began when Air Force leaders decided to phase out active duty air commando units in 1954. Despite the decision, there was still a need to maintain a limited number of crews and aircraft to support unconventional warfare missions. After lengthy deliberations, the Air Force decided in 1955 to establish four special air warfare units within the Air National Guard: the 129th Air Resupply Group in California, the 130th in West Virginia, the 143d in Rhode Island, and the 135th in Maryland. The 135th Air Resupply Squadron was established in September 1955 as a new Maryland Air National Guard unit with no previous United States Air Force history or lineage by the National Guard Bureau. Activated on 10 September at Harbor Field, Baltimore, Maryland, the squadron was assigned to the 135th Air Resupply Group, allocated to Military Air Transport Service (MATS), and equipped with C-46D Commando transports. The 135th was designated at the time as a special operations unit that supported USAF unconventional warfare (guerrilla warfare), direct action (commando-type raids), strategic reconnaissance (intelligence gathering), and psychological operations. The C-46 was supplemented by SA-16 Albatross amphibious aircraft beginning in 1956. The SA-16 (later redesignated HU-16) completely replaced the C-46s in late 1958. Training for water landings with the SA-16 was extremely hazardous. To make matters worse, doctrine required pilots to land their aircraft on water at night, with no landing lights. Night water landings were practiced at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in southern Maryland. Three crewmen were killed when their plane crashed while attempting a water landing in May 1956. Ultimately, the 135th's mission included counterinsurgency, military civic action, psychological operations, tactical air operations, and unconventional warfare. In addition to blacked-out water landings, the SA-16 crews practiced pulling personnel from the ground by means of the Fulton Recovery System, which retired Col. Richard T. Lynch, a former 135th commander, described as being \\"like bungee jumping in reverse.\\" 135th Air Commando Squadron HU-16B Albatross in the early 1960s Exercise Swamp Rat followed a fairly typical training scenario. In October 1959, nine Maryland SA-16s flew to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to work with soldiers of the 77th Special Forces Group. The paratroopers and their equipment were loaded aboard the SA-16s and dropped near the swamps of Fort Stewart, Georgia. 135th crews then flew resupply missions for the troops and extracted them when their mission was complete. In 1960, it relocated to the south side of the Martin Company Airport (now the Martin State Airport) in Middle River, Maryland. It was reassigned to Tactical Air Command in 1962 and re-designated as Air Commando unit, following the revival of an active duty air commando unit at Hurlburt Field, Florida in line with President John F. Kennedy's initiative to bolster the United States military special forces during the early involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1963, the 135th added U-10 Super Couriers to its inventory. The U-10s were used for infiltration, extraction, and psychological operations. These aircraft were temporarily replaced by U-6 Beavers from 1965 to 1967, due to a need for U-10s in Vietnam. In 1963, the 135th participated in Exercise Swift Strike III, one of the largest military maneuvers since World War II. During the exercise, the unit not only flew a variety of special air warfare missions, but received an operational readiness inspection from Tactical Air Command to boot. The 135th also worked with U.S. intelligence agencies. A common mission was to pick up agents in training, fly a zig-zag course to make sure they didn't know where they were headed, then have them parachute out over western Maryland. The trainees then had to make their way to Patuxent with only the resources they carried sometimes taking as much as six weeks to do so. The 135th would then fly down to \\"extract\\" the trainees and bring them home. The unit's loudspeaker-equipped U-10s were used to broadcast orders to student protesters at the University of Maryland during demonstrations in 1971; this was their only actual operational use by the 135th. It remained a special operations-type unit until 1971, when it was reorganized as a tactical air support unit. In this role, it was tasked with providing Forward Air Controllers to direct air strikes in support of troops on the ground. =Tactical Airlift= In 1977, it was again reorganized, this time as a tactical airlift unit as part of a general program to upgrade Air National Guard units. Was assigned the C-7A Caribou light transport, the aircraft being Vietnam War veterans. In 1980, the unit converted to the C-130B Hercules. In 1981, it moved across the field to join other Maryland Air National Guard units based on the north side of the field. The military facilities are named Warfield Air National Guard Base. During the early 1990s, the 135th participated in humanitarian relief efforts in Somalia, peacekeeping and humanitarian relief in Bosnia, the U.S. intervention in Haiti and the enforcement of U.N. sanctions against Iraq during the 1990s. 135th Airlift Squadron C-130J 97-1351 In mid-1996, the Air Force, in response to budget cuts and changing world situations, began experimenting with Air Expeditionary organizations. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix Active-Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard elements into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying as \\"Provisional\\" as in the 1991 Gulf War, Expeditionary units are composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation. In 1999, it dedicated its first C-130J, the latest and most advanced version of the venerable transport. The 135th had played a major role in the test and evaluation of the aircraft and its procedures and was the first fully equipped C-130J unit in the U.S. Air Force. In February 2000, the 135th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron (135th EAS) was first formed from 135th personnel and aircraft and deployed to Lambar√©n√© Airport, Gabon, for an exercise, \\"Gabon 2000\\", with the objective of increasing the capacity of ECCAS states in the field of peacekeeping and conflict prevention and management. This exercise represented a direct application of the French RECAMP-concept (reinforcement of African peacekeeping capacities). BRAC 2005 saw the 8 C-130J aircraft of the squadron being transferred to 314th Airlift group, Little Rock Air Force base. In 2011, the first C-27J Spartan light transport was received. The squadron will obtain four of the C-27Js. 702d Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, 2012. Beginning in July 2011, the 135th AS along with the Ohio Air National Guard 164th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron began rotational deployments for joint operations of the C-27J from Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan as the 702d Expeditionary Airlift Squadron. The 702d EAS flew the two aircraft on 3,200 missions, moved 1,400 tons of cargo, transported 25,000 passengers and executed 71 airdrops, according to Air Force data. In June 2012, operations of the 702d EAS were suspended by the Air Force and returned to the United States. Originally, C-27J aircraft were supposed to remain in theater through 2014, but the Air Force decided to bring all of the aircraft back to the U.S. before the end of July after it submitted its 2013 budget proposal, which recommended terminating the C-27J and retiring the aircraft.702nd Expeditionary Airlift Squadron deactivates at Kandahar Airfield In 2013, the Air Force divested itself of the C-27J program. An inactivation ceremony was held at Warfield ANGB on 27 September 2013, and the 135th Airlift Squadron was scheduled to officially inactivate on 30 September, but for undetermined reasons, an inactivation request was never processed. =Intelligence= Although scheduled to inactivate on 30 September 2013, an organizational change request to that effect was apparently never processed and the unit remained on the books as an active part of the Maryland Air National Guard, albeit without assigned personnel or aircraft. As part of an increased emphasis on cyber warfare, the Maryland Air Guard gained a number of new units supporting this mission set, including a new intelligence squadron. This squadron was initially formed as a detachment of the 175th Wing. In keeping with Air Force historical policy, which, in part, emphasizes keeping units with long histories on the active rolls if possible, an organizational change request was submitted to the National Guard Bureau in 2014 requesting the 135th Airlift Squadron be reorganized and redesignated as the 135th Intelligence Squadron. While the request was still pending approval, the detachment began unofficially using the new designation. On 1 May 2016, the placeholder detachment was inactivated and its personnel officially became the 135th Intelligence Squadron. =Lineage= 135th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron Gabon deployment patch 135th Troop Carrier/Air Resupply Squadron legacy emblem * Designated: 135th Air Resupply Squadron, and allotted to Maryland ANG in September 1955 : Extended federal recognition on 10 September 1955 : Re-designated: 135th Troop Carrier Squadron (Medium), 1 July 1958 : Re- designated: 135th Air Commando Squadron, 1 July 1962 : Re-designated: 135th Special Operations Squadron, 15 June 1968 : Re-designated: 135th Tactical Air Support Squadron, 1 July 1971 : Re-designated: 135th Tactical Airlift Squadron, 1 July 1977 : Re-designated: 135th Airlift Squadron, 16 March 1992 : Re-designated: 135th Intelligence Squadron, 1 May 2016 =Assignments= * 135th Air Resupply Group, 10 September 1955 * Maryland Air National Guard, 1 July 1958 : Gained by Military Air Transport Service * 135th Air Commando Group, 1 July 1962 * 135th Special Operations Group, 15 June 1968 * 135th Tactical Air Support Group, 1 July 1971 * 135th Tactical Airlift Group, 1 July 1977 * 135th Airlift Group, 16 March 1992 * 175th Operations Group, 1 April 1996 * 135th Airlift Group, 1 May 1999 * 175th Wing, 1 May 2016 =Stations= * Baltimore Municipal Airport, Maryland, 10 September 1955 * Martin State Airport, Maryland, 1 July 1960 : Designated: Warfield Air National Guard Base, Maryland, 1982-present =Aircraft= * C-46D Commando, 1955-1958 * HU-16A Albatross, 1956-1962 * HU-16B Albatross, 1957-1971 * U-10 Super Courier, 1963-1972 * U-6A Beaver, 1965-1967 * O-2A Super Skymaster, 1971-1977 * C-7A Caribou, 1977-1980 * C-130B Hercules, 1980-1989 * C-130E Hercules, 1989-2000 * C-130J Hercules, 1999-2011 * C-27J Spartan, 2011-2013 References  Maryland Air Commandos Blazed Special Ops Trail * Air Force sends home C-27J cargo planes. * 702nd Expeditionary Airlift Squadron at Kandahar External links * Maryland National Guard * 175th Wing * Maryland Military Historical Society Squadrons of the United States Air National Guard Military units and formations disestablished in 2013 Military units and formations in Maryland 135 ","title":"135th Airlift Squadron"},{"id":"16043829","text":"Lacapelle-S√©galar is a commune in the Tarn department and Occitanie region of southern France.

Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a gathering place to organize and train troops for the Union army. The city became a major railroad hub for troop transport to Confederate lands, and therefore had military importance. Twenty-four military camps were established in the vicinity of Indianapolis. Camp Morton, the initial mustering ground to organize and train the state's Union volunteers in 1861, was designated as a major prisoner-of-war camp for captured Confederate soldiers in 1862. In addition to military camps, a state-owned arsenal was established in the city in 1861, and a federal arsenal in 1862. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis to house and feed Union soldiers and their families as they passed through the city. Indianapolis residents also supported the Union cause by providing soldiers with food, clothing, equipment, and supplies, despite rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. Local doctors aided the sick, some area women provided nursing care, and Indianapolis City Hospital tended to wounded soldiers. Indianapolis sent an estimated 4,000 men into military service; an estimated 700 died during the war. Indianapolis's Crown Hill National Cemetery was established as one of two national military cemeteries established in Indiana in 1866. During the war, the city's population increased with the arrival of new businesses and industries that offered additional employment opportunities, spurred real estate development, and ushered in the beginning of the city's urban, industrial development. In addition, street crime was prevalent, causing the city government to increase its police force and local merchants to hire private security. The era was also a time of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. In May 1863, in an incident sarcastically called the Battle of Pogue's Run, Union soldiers stopped and searched two departing trainloads of delegates to a statewide Democratic convention, many of whom tossed their personal weapons into a nearby creek. In July 1863 Indianapolis residents feared an attack from Confederate forces during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but the Confederates turned east toward Ohio and never came to the city. After the war, increased wartime manufacturing and industrial growth ushered in a new era of economic prosperity, and Indianapolis's population increased from 8,000 in 1850 to 45,000 at the end of 1864. A real-estate boom led to the establishment of new residential suburbs, but the city retained its slums. Indianapolis also experienced improvements to its public services, such as health care, utilities, street railways, and public schools. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. Construction for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument began in 1888, in the center of downtown Indianapolis, after decades of discussion. The city's iconic monument was dedicated on May 15, 1902. War years During the American Civil War, Indianapolis served as a gathering place for organizing troops. As Indianapolis's citizens rallied in support of the Union, its population increased with the arrival of new businesses and industries that offered additional employment opportunities and spurred real estate development. City residents experienced rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. It was also a time of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. The Civil War era ushered in the beginning of the city's urban, industrial development, its connections to an expanding railroad network, and the growth of local charitable organizations. =1861= During the winter of 1860‚Äì1861, there was talk throughout the region of a possible of war with the South, but Indianapolis had only four militia groups ready to fight: the National Guards, the City Greys, the Indianapolis Independent Zouaves, and the Zouave Guards. On January 7, 1861, the Indianapolis Zouaves volunteered for service if Indiana's governor, Oliver P. Morton, requested it, but they were not needed until spring. On February 11, 1861, president-elect Abraham Lincoln arrived in Indianapolis, one of several train stops he made en route to Washington, D.C., for his presidential inauguration. The pre-inauguration stop made Lincoln the first president-elect to visit Indianapolis.Dunn, Greater Indianapolis, v. 1, p. 217. Two months later, the United States was on the brink of war. On April 12, news arrived in Indianapolis via telegraph that Confederate forces had opened fire on Fort Sumter, a federal fort in the harbor at Charleston, South Carolina. On April 13, two mass meetings were held in Indianapolis, where resolutions were approved to support the Union. Indianapolis citizens proclaimed, \\"We unite as one man to repel all treasonable assaults upon the Government, its people, and citizens in every department of the Union‚Äì‚Äìpeaceably, if we can, forcibly if we must.\\"Leary, p. 96. On April 15, 1861, President Lincoln responded to the surrender of the federal fort after the Battle of Fort Sumter by calling for 75,000 volunteers to join the Union army and restore order. Governor Morton telegraphed Lincoln offering 10,000 Hoosier men to defend the country, but the state's initial quota was set at six regiments (a total of 4,683 men) for three months of service. Orders were issued on April 16 to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis a gathering point for volunteers to enlist. On the first day, 500 men were encamped in the city. Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits had signed up to fight for the Union, nearly three times as many needed to meet the state's initial quota.Thornbrough, p. 124. 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment Governor Morton and Lew Wallace, Indiana's adjutant general, quickly established Camp Morton on the former grounds of the Indiana State Fair (along Alabama Street, north of the city) as the initial mustering ground to organize and train the state's Union volunteers. The camp's first soldiers arrived on April 17.Parsons, p. 13. During the war a total of 24 military camps were established in the vicinity of Indianapolis, including Camp Sullivan, Camp Morton, Camp Burnside, Camp Freemont, and Camp Carrington, which was the state's largest.Leary, p. 99.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 443. On April 20 Indianapolis's city council appropriated $10,000 for wartime use. Four days later, the Indiana General Assembly convened in Indianapolis to give the governor wartime powers and appropriate funds to support the war effort ($1.6 million for military purposes and a $2 million bond issue for state and national defense).Leary, p. 98. To provide ammunition, Governor Morton established a state-owned arsenal at Indianapolis.The state arsenal operated until April 1864, employing 700 at its peak. Many of the employees were women. See Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 441, and Thornbrough, p. 165. Congress passed legislation to establish a permanent federal arsenal at Indianapolis in 1862. By April 27, 1861, Indiana's first six regiments, all of which were organized at Indianapolis,Thornbrough, p. 126, and were fully organized as the First Brigade, Indiana Volunteers, under the command of Brigadier General Thomas A. Morris. These included the 6th Indiana, the 7th Indiana,The 7th Indiana was under the command of Colonel Ebenezer Dumont of Indianapolis, who later served two terms in Congress as a U.S. Representative from Indiana. See the 8th Indiana, the 9th Indiana, the 10th Indiana, and the 11th Indiana infantry regiments.Terrell, v. 2, pp. 65‚Äì66. Slightly more than sixty percent (104) of Indiana's total regiments mustered into service and trained at Indianapolis. Men from Indianapolis and surrounding Marion County, Indiana, served in 39 regiments. In total, Indianapolis sent an estimated 4,000 men into the service. The first resident of Indianapolis to die in the war was Private John C. Hollenbeck, of Company B, 11th Indiana. He died near Romney, Virginia on June 27, 1861.Leary, pp. 99, 113‚Äì14.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 441. An estimated 700 Indianapolis residents died during the war. The 11th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment, also known as the Indiana Zouaves, was the first regiment organized in Indiana during the war and the first one to leave Indianapolis, on May 8, 1861.Thornbrough p. 125. All four of Indianapolis's militia units (National Guards, the City Greys, the Indianapolis Independent Zouaves, and the Zouave Guards), and an additional company of men from Indianapolis, became part of the regiment.Dunn, Greater Indianapolis, v. 1, p. 220. Wallace, who resigned as Indiana's adjutant general to take command of the 11th Indiana, went on to become a major general in the Union army. First Lieutenant Frederick Knefler, another Indianapolis resident, was an officer from Company H, 11th Indiana, who eventually rose to the rank of brevet brigadier general and became the highest-ranking Jewish military officer in the Union. Francis A. Shoup, also from Indianapolis, briefly led the Independent Zouaves before the war, but he decided to go south and ultimately became a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army.Holliday, pp. 551‚Äì54. Most of Indiana's regimental units were organized within towns or counties, but ethnic units also formed. The 32nd Indiana, the state's first German-American infantry regiment, and the 35th Indiana, the state's first Irish-American regiment, organized at Indianapolis in 1861. Other regiments established in 1861 that included residents of Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana, included the 19th Indiana, the 27th Indiana, and the 33rd Indiana, among others. There was little doubt that the majority of Indianapolis residents supported the Union. The city became a hub for Union troop organization and training. Pro-Union mobs would sometimes force individuals suspected of Confederate sympathies to take an oath of loyalty at the mayor's office. The most notable of these was J. J. Bingham, the editor of the Indianapolis Sentinel. A mob forced Bingham to take a loyalty oath after articles critical of his political views appeared in the Indianapolis Journal.The Sentinel supported the Democratic position on issues; the Journal supported the Republicans. See Thornbrough, p. 117. =1862= Union Station Union troops continued to organize and train at military camps in the city, as battles in Kentucky and Tennessee caused major changes to Indianapolis. After the battles of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, the Union began to collect a large number of Confederate prisoners of war for transport to the North. Governor Morton volunteered to hold some of the prisoners at Indianapolis. Designated as one of four northern prisoner-of-war camps, Camp Morton was converted into one of the Union's largest prisons for captured Confederate soldiers. Camp Morton's first Confederate prisoners arrived on February 22‚Äì23, 1862. Many of the 2,398 Confederates in the first group were sick, ill fed, and without sufficient clothing for the cold, northern winters. The citizens of Indianapolis rallied to provide humanitarian aid for the prisoners, which included additional food, clothing, and supplies. Local doctors aided the sick and local women provided nursing care.Leary, p, 100.Dunn, Greater Indianapolis, v. 1, pp. 226‚Äì27. The Athenaeum, at the corner of East Michigan Street and Massachusetts Avenue, and another local building were converted into hospitals to treat the Confederate prisoners.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 382, 441. For the remainder of the war, Camp Morton typically housed between 3,000 and 6,000 prisoners.Sulgrove, p. 313. As regiments organized and reorganized, Union soldiers continued to gather at Indianapolis, sometimes as many as 12,000 at a time.Dunn, Greater Indianapolis, p. 229. Indianapolis regiments formed in 1862 included the 70th Indiana, under the command of Benjamin Harrison, and the 79th Indiana, under the command of Frederick Knefler. Popular gathering spots for the soldiers included Monument Circle and University Park.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 442 A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis in 1862 and in 1863, respectively, to house and feed Indiana's soldiers and their families as they passed through Indianapolis.Thornbrough, pp. 170, 176, and City residents continued to aid Union soldiers by providing food, clothing, equipment, and supplies. Soldiers' aid societies and the Indiana Sanitary Commission, established in 1862 with its headquarters in Indianapolis, raised funds and gathered supplies for troops in the field. The women of Indianapolis also organized groups, usually local Ladies' Aid Societies, to provide soldiers with blankets and clothing, and helped raise funds for additional troop supplies.Dunn, Greater Indianapolis, v. 1, p. 224. Street crime was prevalent in Indianapolis during the war. The city government increased its police force, local merchants hired private security, and guards were posted at Union Station to deal with law-enforcement issues. Fights, robberies, gambling, prostitution, and drunkenness became significant problems.Dunn, Greater Indianapolis, v. 1, p. 229.Prostitution became such a problem that construction for an Indianapolis Home for Friendless Women was begun in 1863, south of the city, but it was never completed. It was reestablished closer to the city's center in 1867. See Leary, p. 99, and Holloway, p. 125‚Äì26. Prohibition of alcohol sales had to be established in the city. Because there was so much street violence, city police never bothered to discover who murdered an officer from Pennsylvania. The bodies of many deceased soldiers killed in the war were held at Indianapolis's Union Station, awaiting transport to their eventual burial spots. Several Indiana facilities cared for wounded soldiers, including Indianapolis City Hospital.Built in 1859, City Hospital, the forerunner to the Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital, stood vacant and unused until it was converted to a military hospital. See Leary, p. 119, Thornbrough, pp. 171, 583, and Governor Morton and the Indiana Sanitary Commission began recruiting women to work as nurses at military hospitals and ships in January 1863. The city was also the wartime home of Richard Jordan Gatling, a physician and entrepreneur, who invented the Gatling gun. Tested in Indianapolis and patented in November 1862, the hand-cranked, rapid-fire gun was a predecessor to the modern machine gun. The U.S. Navy adopted the Gatling gun during the war, where it was used on federal gunboats, but the U.S. Army did not formally adopt it for use until 1866.Funk, A Sketchbook of Indiana History, pp. 99‚Äì100. =1863= Site of the Battle of Pogue's Run The first military execution in the war's western theater occurred on March 27, 1863, at Camp Burnside (Burnside Barracks). Robert Gay, a 27-year-old schoolteacher from Clay County, Indiana, was executed by a 20-man firing squad. After his capture by Confederates at Richmond, Kentucky, Gay declared allegiance to the Confederate States of America to escape further army service. After his return to Indiana, Gay was convicted of treason and executed, but not before he apologized for what he had done.Holliday, pp. 57‚Äì58 Other executions took place in 1864, when three bounty jumpers were executed at Burnside Barracks.Leary, p. 101. Major political differences between Democrats and Republicans and wartime propaganda caused many Hoosiers to become suspicious of dissenters and fearful of potential insurrections, especially from secret societies sympathetic to the South. During the Indianapolis city election In May, the Democrats, who decided a fair election could not be held, withdrew their ticket. Only 14 votes were cast for Democratic candidates in the nine Indianapolis wards. Prior to a state Democratic convention in May, rumors had spread that members of a secret society, who were planning to attend the convention in Indianapolis, were plotting to attack Camp Morton and the state arsenal. In response to the perceived threat, soldiers were posted to guard the city and protect government property. On May 20 Union soldiers attempted to the convention, forcing the proceedings to be adjourned. Elsewhere in the city, men were arrested for carrying concealed weapons or taken into custody for further questioning. After the convention adjourned, Union soldiers stopped and searched two departing trainloads of convention delegates, demanding that the passengers surrender their personal weapons. The soldiers seized \\"several hundred\\" weapons, while the passengers tossed others into Pogue's Run, a nearby creek.Thornbrough, p. 202. The incident, later called the Battle of Pogue's Run, caused no serious trouble, but it did illustrate the intensity of the state's ongoing political feuds. The Republicans used the seized weapons as evidence that the Democrats were disloyal to the Union and guilty of treasonable plots.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 1121. Camp Morton Rumors of plots to overthrow Morton and Indiana's government continued during the summer. On July 8, 1863, when Confederate general John Hunt Morgan crossed the Ohio River with 2,400 troopers, Indiana went into a state of emergency. Only the day before, the citizens of Indianapolis were rejoicing over the Union victories at Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The city's mood turned to panic when Morgan's troops appeared to be headed toward Indianapolis. Many Hoosiers feared Morgan would attack the city and attempt to free the Confederate prisoners at Camp Morton. The panic was increased as Morgan's telegrapher, \\"Lightning\\" Ellsworth, posing as various Union telegraphers, claimed Morgan had far more men than he actually did. Ellsworth also sent false information suggesting Morgan would attack Indianapolis, among other locations. Within forty-eight hours an estimated 65,000 Indiana volunteers had assembled to fight the Confederate raiders.Thornbrough, p. 204. Five regiments encamped on the grounds of the Indiana Statehouse were prepared to defend the state capital. Tension in the city ended on July 14, when it was confirmed that Morgan had left Indiana and entered Ohio. Morgan was captured on July 26. Volunteers who served in the temporary regiments at Indianapolis mustered out of service on July 17, once the threat from Morgan's troops was gone. An accident caused by the explosion of ammunition in a caisson killed a boy, three soldiers, and two horses as some of the soldiers were departing town.Holliday, pp.58‚Äì59; Barnhart, pp. 212‚Äì13; and Terrill, v. 1, Appendix, pp. 38‚Äì41. =1864= New regiments continued to muster into service at Indianapolis. The 28th Regiment U.S. Colored Troops, organized between December 24, 1863, and March 31, 1864, was the only black regiment formed in Indiana during the war.Dyer, p. 1728.Dunn, Greater Indianapolis, v. 1, p. 251. The regiment trained at Camp Fremont, near Fountain Square. It included 518 enlisted men who signed on for a term of three years, but the war was effectively over within a year, cutting short its term of service. The regiment lost 212 men before it mustered out of service on November 8, 1865.Madison and Sandweiss, pp. 100‚Äì02, and Terrell, v. 1, p. 81. Indianapolis's \\"City Regiment\\" mustered into service as the 132nd Indiana Infantry Regiment in May 1864 as one of several regiments of Hundred Days Men. The regiment guarded railroads in Tennessee and Alabama, which were firmly in the control of Union forces, to relieve the regular U.S. army troops for active duty on the front lines. The 132nd Indiana, which was formed mostly of young boys and older men, was a favorite among Indianapolis citizens. Twelve of its members of disease before the regiment returned home.Dunn, Greater Indianapolis, v. 1, pp. 235‚Äì36. Beginning in September 1864, Indianapolis was the site of the trials by a military commission of several men accused and convicted of treason. In a landmark civil liberty case that became known as Ex parte Milligan, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the convictions, On April 3, 1866, the Court ruled that the military trial was illegal because the civilian courts were open and functioning during the war. Following the Court's ruling, the men were released.Leary, p. 111‚Äì12. =1865= Soldiers & Sailors Monument in Indianapolis was built to honor the war dead. News of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia, reached Indianapolis at 11 p.m. on April 9, 1865, causing wild, public celebrations that the Indianapolis Journal characterized as \\"demented.\\" The celebrations soon turned to sadness when news of the assassination of President Lincoln arrived on April 15. Lincoln's funeral train passed through the city on April 30, en route to Springfield, Illinois. An estimated 100,000 people waited in long lines to pass Lincoln's bier at the Indiana Statehouse, where the president's remains lay in state. Indianapolis residents saw much activity in the drawdown of military forces at the end of the war. The last military troops organized in Indianapolis was the 156th Indiana, which mustered into service on April 12 for a year of service. In June formal receptions honored soldiers who returned home. On June 12 the last Confederate prisoner was parrolled at Camp Morton. On July 25 a military wagon train, in length, passed through the city. By the autumn of 1865 the city's Soldiers' Home and Ladies' Home had closed, as did most of the city's military camps after the soldiers left Indianapolis.Dunn, Greater Indianapolis, p. 237. Aftermath Indiana's economic situation improved after the war, particularly in Indianapolis; its population increased from 8,000 in 1850 to 45,000 people at the end of 1864. The city's population exceeded 75,000 by 1880.Stampp, \\"The Impact of the Civil War Upon Hoosier Society\\", pp. 7‚Äì9, and Thornbrough, pp. 706‚Äì07. As a result of the war, the city experienced a real-estate boom. Real-estate transactions increased from more than $1 million in 1860 to more than $5 million by 1870.Leary, p. 120. New residential suburbs, such as Irvington and Woodruff Place, were established, but Indianapolis still retained its slum areas.Leary, p. 117.Hale, pp. 26, 30‚Äì31. As the city grew, it also experienced a need for more public services, such as utilities and street railways, as well as an improved public school system.Leary, p. 116‚Äì19.Thornbrough, pp. 710. A street railway came to the city in the 1860s,Leary, 119. the city established its first sewage system in 1869,Holloway, p. 130‚Äì31. most of the city's downtown streets were illuminated with gaslights by 1870,Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 817‚Äì18. and the first water supplied from a central waterworks was delivered to city residents in 1871.Hyman, p. 141; Esarey, v. III, p. 209; and Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 813. Health care in the city also improved. Indianapolis City Hospital was equipped and staffed to begin treatment of civilian patients in 1866. Increased wartime manufacturing and industrial growth ushered in a new era of economic prosperity and the rise of labor unions in the city. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center.Manufacturing investments increased from $647,650 in 1860 to $8,420,614 in 1870. See Leary, p. 117.The state's river towns declined in importance, but one exception was Evansville, Indiana, which ranked second to Indianapolis \\"in the amount of capital invested in manufacturing.\\" See Thornbrough, p. 415. New Albany, the state's largest antebellum city, declined due to its previous ties to the Southern states and Indiana's pro-Northern sympathies. See New industries in Indianapolis included pork-packing plants and foundries, as well as numerous manufacturers, small businesses, retail shops, and banks.Leary, pp. 116‚Äì17. In 1876 Colonel Eli Lilly opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory on Indianapolis's Pearl Street, founding what later became Eli Lilly and Company. The Union Railroad Transfer and Stock Yards Company, another major employer, opened in 1877.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 1299. After the war, Indianapolis continued to develop into a transportation hub. Existing railroad lines expanded and new ones were established, linking Indianapolis to other cities across the nation.Madison, Hoosiers, pp. 172‚Äì75. Indianapolis residents continued to assist those in need. Veterans programs were initiated to help wounded soldiers with housing, food, and other basic necessities.Dunn, Greater Indianapolis, v. 1, p. 238. New orphanages and asylums joined the Indianapolis Orphans' Home, chartered in 1850, to aid women and children. The German Protestant Orphans' Association was organized in 1867. The Indianapolis Asylum for Friendless Colored Children, the state's only orphanage for African American children, was established in 1870.Thornbrough, pp. 580‚Äì81, Sulgrove, pp. 382‚Äì83, and Other major charitable groups included the Indianapolis Benevolent Society and the Indianapolis Flower Mission, both organized in 1876.Sulgrove, p. 380, Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 585, and Dunn, Greater Indianapolis, p. 606. When the South returned to firm Democratic control at the end of the 1870s, Indiana became a key swing state, one of a few that often decided the outcome of national elections. Five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets in elections held between 1868 and 1916.Schuyler Colfax, William Hayden English, Thomas A. Hendricks, Charles W. Fairbanks, John W. Kern, and Thomas R. Marshall were vice-presidential nominees from Indiana. See Madison, p. 214. Benjamin Harrison, an Indianapolis lawyer and former officer in the Union army, was elected the 23rd president of the United States in 1888. Memorials and tributes In 1866 Indianapolis's Crown Hill National Cemetery was established within the grounds of Crown Hill Cemetery, a privately owned cemetery northwest of downtown. It is one of two national military cemeteries established in Indiana as a result of the war.New Albany National Cemetery, the state's other national cemetery, was established in 1862 at New Albany, Indiana. See That same year, the first Union soldiers' bodies that had been buried elsewhere in the city during the war were reinterred at Crown Hill.Wissing, pp. 33, 35. In November 1866 the city continued to honor the service of Civil War veterans as the host of the first national Grand Army of the Republic encampment.Leary, p. 126. The Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in downtown Indianapolis was erected to honor Indiana veterans of the Civil War. Construction began in 1888 after two decades of discussion. The monument was completed in 1901and dedicated on May 15, 1902.Bodenhamer and Barrows, ed., p. 1278. The Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument was commissioned by the U.S. federal government in 1912 to memorialize the 1,616 Confederate soldiers buried in a mass grave at Indianapolis' Greenlawn Cemetery. When the dead were reinterred at Crown Hill National Cemetery beginning in 1928, the monument was moved to its current location in Garfield Park.

History The site of Montans was occupied by a Gallic oppidum. Already, the Gauls were producing pottery on the site since the environment was favorable with the alluvium covering the terrace containing pockets of clay.
