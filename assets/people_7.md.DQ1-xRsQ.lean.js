He was 13th Chief of Ordnance for the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps. Biography Samuel Hof was born on October 24, 1870 in Boscobel, Wisconsin, and graduated from West Point in 1894. Some of his classmates also became general officers, including Frank Parker, Hamilton S. Hawkins III, George H. Estes, John W. Joyes, Ora E. Hunt, Pegram Whitworth, Briant H. Wells, John F. Preston, Francis L. Parker, Paul B. Malone and George Vidmer. He was originally commissioned a second lieutenant of cavalry in 1894, but he was later transferred to the Ordnance Corps. For his service as a commanding officer of the Frankford Arsenal, he was later awarded with the Distinguished Service Medal. He was Chief of Ordnance from 1930 to 1934. His four-year term came at the height of the Depression resulting in a significant decrease in funding for the Ordnance Department. Despite these difficulties, there was a general advance in the design and manufacturing of ordnance materiel. He made a number of recommendations for improved efficiencies in the department's supply responsibilities. Hof retired from the Army in 1934 and died on March 10, 1937 in Washington, D.C. aged 66. He is buried together with his wife Alice Mayo Hof (1873‚Äì1962) at West Point Cemetery.

Early life He was born Robert Henry Warren in Lake Providence, Louisiana, in 1919, and at the age of three months moved with his parents to Memphis, Tennessee.Harris, S. (1981). Blues Who's Who. New York: Da Capo Press. pp. 534‚Äì535. He was interested in music from an early age, and was working occasionally as a musician from around 1931, when he dropped out of school, having learned to play guitar from two of his older brothers.Russell, T.; Smith, C. (2006). The Penguin Guide to Blues Recordings. London: Penguin Books. p. 681. In the 1930s, he worked in W. C. Handy Park, Memphis, with Howling Wolf, Robert Jr. Lockwood and Little Buddy Doyle and he appeared on the radio show King Biscuit Time, broadcast from Helena, Arkansas, with Sonny Boy Williamson around 1941. In 1942, he moved to Detroit, where he worked for General Motors while also performing as a musician. Recordings Warren's first recording sessions were in 1949 and 1950 in Detroit, with the five resulting singles being released on a number of labels.Leadbitter, M.; Fancourt, L.; Pelletier, P. (1994). Blues Records 1943‚Äì1970, vol. 2, L‚ÄìZ. London: Record Information Services. pp. 674‚Äì675. Tracks recorded at a 1954 session accompanied by Sonny Boy Williamson were released on Joe Von Battle's JVB label and by Excello Records. Further sessions the same year resulted in a single on the Blue Lake label, with Boogie Woogie Red on piano and Calvin Frazier on guitar, and a reworking of the Robert Johnson song \\"Stop Breakin' Down\\" for the Drummond label. Later career and death Warren was mostly inactive in music in the 1960s but revived his career with performances at the Detroit Blues Festival in 1971 and the Ann Arbor Blues Festival in 1973 and with a tour of Europe with Boogie Woogie Red in 1972. From 1974 to 1976 he was also a featured performer, along with Willie D. Warren, with the Progressive Blues Band, a popular band that played in many of Detroit's blues venues. He suffered a fatal heart attack at his home on July 1, 1977, and was buried at Detroit Memorial Park Cemetery in Macomb County, Michigan.Detroit Memorial Park Personal information Warren was given the nickname \\"Baby Boy\\" by his older brothers when he was a child. He was one of twelve children. He married twice, in 1935 and in the early 1960s, and had seven children. On releases by Staff Records, Federal Records and Swing Time Records, he was credited as Johnny Williams. Influences Warren's chief influences were Little Buddy Doyle and Willie \\"61\\" Blackwell, especially in his approach to lyrics. He stated that another musician he particularly admired was Memphis Minnie, whom he knew in Memphis in the 1930s.Garon, P.; Garon, B. (1992). Woman with Guitar: Memphis Minnie's Blues.

Soul World was first alluded to in-story in Strange Tales #179 (1975), and first depicted on- the-page in Warlock Vol 2 #6 (1983). Soul World is described as a ‚Äúpocket dimension‚Äù contained within the plot-motivating Soul Gem, and is depicted as an idyllic alien landscape inhabited by the souls of characters most commonly associated with Starlin's recurrent fictional protagonist, Adam Warlock. Soul World serves the narrative as a place of purgatory for souls \\"captured\\" by Warlock. Fictional depiction Soul World is featured most often in the Marvel Comics cosmic-based tales Jim Starlin helped revitalize in the 1970s with the re-purposing of the 1960s Stan Lee created character, Him, which Starlin renamed as Adam Warlock.\\"Reading Comics: How Graphic Novels Work and What They Mean,\\" by Douglas Wolk, De Capo Press, 2008, Chapter 18: \\"The Dark Mirrors of Jim Starlin's Warlock,\\" pages 304-316\\"Marvel Comics in the 1970s: An Issue-by-Issue Field Guide to a Pop Culture Phenomenon\\", by Pierre Comtois, TwoMorrows Publishing, 2011, page 180, -Strange Tales #178 In the early storylines, Warlock was given an enchanted gemstone (the Soul Gem) by the protagonist, the High Evolutionary, which granted Warlock the ability to steal the souls of his enemies. Allusions were made to the captured souls as ‚Äúresiding‚Äù within the gem, but it was not until the 1980s death and resurrection of Warlock story-arch when it was revealed that an actual world existed within the gem, inhabited by those captured souls. Starlin illustrated Soul World as a pastoral alien landscape, featuring rolling hills and spiring mountains. The Soul Gem was later retconned to be among the six Infinity Gems comprising the totemic Infinity Gauntlet, though Warlock maintained an intrinsic link to the gem and the world within, the latter of which he often utilized as a place of imprisonment for his enemies, as well as a place of refuge and self-exile for himself and his friends. It was later discovered that while Adam Warlock is considered the god of Soul World\\"100 Things Avengers Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die\\", by Dan Casey, Triumph Books, 2015, pages 88-90, this pocket dimension is actually overseen by an ancient eldritch soul-eating creature known as Devondra, a being with the ability to create new universes from its silk and whose lower half resembles a spider, possess long arms, four digits on each hand, many tentacles on face, multiple eyes and fangs. It was Devondra that caused Soul World to transform from a paradise to a hellish wasteland and was theorized that once Devondra has eaten enough souls, she will spin threads within the Soul Stone in order to birth a new reality. Basically, once the creature is sated the Stone enables its wielder to alter reality, or worse yet, remake it. Narrative function Starlin initially used Soul World in his stories to serve as a place of exile and purgatory for a supporting cast of characters most commonly affiliated with his protagonist, Adam Warlock. Warlock is portrayed as being the possessor of the Soul Gem, thereby the de facto god of Soul World. Starlin used Soul World as a place of self-exile for Warlock in that character's death and resurrection storyline.\\"Marveleous Myths: Marvel Superheroes and Everyday Faith,\\" by Russell W. Dalton, Chalice Press, 2011, page 188 In the 1990s Infinity Gauntlet trilogy - a Starlin created mini-series - the stories show Warlock using Soul World as a place of exile for the defeated antagonists.\\"Marvel Graphic Novels and Related Publications: An Annotated Guide to Comics, Prose Novels, Children's Books, Articles, Criticism and Reference Works, 1965-2005,\\" by Robert G.

His life was changed by the Bolshevik uprising in 1918 when he was forced to flee to Harbin in China. He later moved to Hollywood where he continued to work as an artist.  Early Years in Russia  The artist Anatole Alexandrovich Efimoff, Anatolii Aleksandrovich Efimov was born November 21, 1897, to well-to-do parents in the Russian city of Ufa in the Urals. Anatole's artistic and musical talents were recognized at a young age, and in 1906 he entered the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. Anatole spoke of his training under the guidance of Klavdy Lebedev, as being intense and full-time, except for short holidays spent visiting his family. His first two years of study focused solely on drawing, forming a solid basis for the paintings of historical buildings he completed later in life. His study was in the style of traditional, realistic art. Upon his graduation in 1914, Anatole was deemed to have mastered all media and was awarded the title \\"master artist\\". Immediately after graduation, Anatole joined his father and older brother serving in the Czar's Imperial Cavalry. The Bolshevik uprising and the assassination of the Czar in 1918 brought an abrupt end to his privileged life in Russia. His father and brother were killed in battle and his mother died in a Bolshevik prison. In the winter of 1918, Anatole and what remained of his cavalry unit, left Russia on a four-month trek through Siberia to Harbin, Manchuria, which was then a part of China.  Thirty Years in China  In the early 1920s, Harbin was home to the largest population of Russians living outside of Russia ‚Äìover 100,000 White Russian √©migr√©s who had fled the Bolsheviks. Like thousands of his countrymen, Anatole arrived in Harbin with only the clothes on his back and a few family photos. He soon found work conducting and arranging music for a newly formed balalaika orchestra. In Anatole's ten years in Harbin, he established himself as an artist in demand with his portraits and miniatures, and continued arranging and conducting for various orchestras. Anatole left Harbin in 1930, in advance of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and relocated to Tsingtao (now Qingdao), China. The years in Tsingtao were very productive for the artist. He became fluent in Mardarin, opened the Lotus Art Studio where he showed his work and taught both foreign and local students, spent months at a time in Peking (now Beijing), and traveled frequently to show his work in Shanghai. In the early 1940s, Anatole moved again to Shanghai. There he continued to work as an artist and hold frequent showings of his work. He also taught art at the Russian High School for Girls and worked as the Business Manager for the Russian Hospital in Shanghai. In 1949, shortly before the Chinese Communists‚Äô arrival in Shanghai, all Russians living in China were advised to leave the country. In his position as Business Manager at the Russian Hospital in Shanghai, Anatole personally packed the hospital's equipment, instruments and drugs for transport to the International Organization's Refugee Camp in Tubabao, Philippines. Included in the packed crates were a few of Anatole's personal possessions and some of his art created in his 30 years in China. In March 1949, Anatole became one of approximately 5,000 stateless refugees living in tents on the island of Tubabao. He was interned for eighteen months while awaiting approval of his application for entry into the United States.  Final Years in United States  Anatole arrived in San Francisco in November 1950. He was 53 years old. His sponsors, the newspaperman Carroll Alcott, among them, secured a small duplex for him in Hollywood, California, and arranged for his first private showing in the United States in 1951. Efimoff's collection of \\"Temples and Palaces of Old Peking\\" was exhibited several times in Los Angeles in the early 1950s. In China, Efimoff had shown and sold his work regularly. In Los Angeles, he spurned commercial galleries and despite many requests, would allow his work to be shown only in Los Angeles where he could be in attendance. During his 32 years in Hollywood, Efimoff lived a modest life style and supported himself by teaching art. Efimoff never married and died on October 20, 1981, a month shy of his 84th birthday. He often told friends that his art was his life. It had sustained him through all of life's upheavals and losses. Other than occasionally selling or gifting a painting to a friend, he had no desire to let go of any of them. Today, Efimoff's works can be found in private collections.

(2,400 m.).  Distribution and ecology  Hydrangea integrifolia is found scrambling along shady woodland floors, up tree trunks, and over rocky outcroppings. It grows in partially shaded areas and on coastal cliffs under salt spray.  Description  Hydrangea integrifolia leaves have red petioles. Hydrangea integrifolia retains its dried lace-cap blooms. Hydrangea integrifolia is a vine with adventitious roots that enable it to climb without assistance onto any nearby solid structure. The leaves are about 6 inches long, dark green, and glossy with a leathery texture. Their overall shape is elongated and ovate with undulating and toothed margins. Leaves are held opposite and in pairs along the stems. The petioles on newer or top growth appear bright red while others show yellow-green. Flower buds appear somewhat differently from other Hydrangeas in that they resemble over-sized golf balls prior to opening. H. integrifolia blooms open around June with terminal cymes displaying many small, white blossoms. Flowers resemble those of deciduous Hydrangeas in lace-cap form‚Äîthough most often without the sterile blooms around the edges of the cyme. Spent blooms dry and are retained through the season. Fruits are dry, brown capsules.  Cultivation and uses  Hydrangea integrifolia climbs with adventitious roots. Its leaves are paired and opposite. Hydrangea integrifolia is primarily used as an ornamental. It is vigorous but grows slowly enough to not become invasive. It is salt tolerant and shade tolerant though full shade will reduce the amount of blooming. H. integrifolia requires regular watering, well-drained soil and sturdy supports. It can handle full sun to partial or dappled shade. H. intergrifolia may take 5 to 7 years to reach maturity and begin blooming but will bring layered texture and brightness high up in shady areas where these traits are rare. It fares best in milder climates such as USDA hardiness zones 8a to 10b. Pruning is only necessary for aesthetics and is typically limited to minor training of growth and deadheading. H. integrifolia can be propagated by cuttings and seeds.

Discovered in 1964 and described in 2001, it is named after Anthony R. Kampf. The mineral is known only from Fresno County, California. Description Kampfite is translucent and light blue-gray in color. Specimens occur as irregular masses up to in size. Composition and structure When first described, the formula was identified as Ba6[(Si,Al)O2]8(CO3)2Cl2(Cl,H2O)2. Subsequent work on analyzing the crystal structure led to a revised formula of Ba12(Si11Al5)O31(CO3)8Cl5. The structural H2O noted in the original description was not found in the later work. The structure consists of double layers of tetrahedra connected by barium-containing polyhedra. It is this layering which causes kampfite's one perfect cleavage. Kampfite shares chemical and structural similarities with cymrite. , it is the only known barium silicate carbonate aside from fencooperite. Occurrence Kampfite has been found in association with celsian, fresnoite, macdonaldite, pyrrhotite, titantaramellite, traskite, and witherite. The mineral is known only from locations in Fresno County, California. Kampfite is found in quartz-rich regions of sanbornite rocks within gneiss which has undergone contact metamorphism associated with an adjacent granodiorite intrusive. History The mineral discovered in 1964 by Robert Walstrom from the Esquire #1 claim of the Rush Creek deposit in eastern Fresno County. It was described in 2001 in The Canadian Mineralogist. The mineral was named kampfite in honor of Anthony Robert Kampf (1948‚Äì), curator of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, for his crystallography work on new and rare minerals.

The film is also known as Meet the Mob. Plot Emma Bates is an old spinster living with her equally unmarried sisters. One day she decides to go to New York City to see a fight where a young man, Mickey O'Banion, is one of the boxers. Emma's sisters are appalled by this decision, unaware that Mickey is the son of a man with whom Emma was once involved years ago. Emma arrives in the city without tickets to the fight and it is sold out. However, newspaper reporter Terry Connors, who is supposed to cover the sports event, gives his spare ticket to Emma. Terry normally reports on criminal news, but failed to scoop a kidnapping of a famous lawyer named Rex Crenshaw, and was put on sports duty instead. While trying to get the kidnapping story, Terry sacrificed a quite-important appointment at the marriage license office, and his fianc√©e Maris was enraged enough to break up with him. At the fight, Terry starts suspecting Mickey's manager Gus Hammond of kidnapping the lawyer, since Crenshaw represented Hammond's gangster rival, Flower Henderson. Two of Hammond's henchmen, Joe and Duke, see Terry at the fight, sitting and talking next to Emma, which leads them to believe Emma is in fact a mobster called Ma Parker. Henderson sees Hammond at the fight, and tells his goons to do off with Joe and Duke. He also makes his girlfriend Zelda try to charm Mickey to win him over. The fight is, of course, fixed, and Mickey wins. Afterwards, Emma comes to his dressing room and tries to persuade him to come training at her place in the country, for even better results. Since Joe and Duke still believe she is Ma Parker, they tell her to leave Mickey alone and get out of their hair. Emma doesn't scare easily, and after she has left, Joe and Duke are killed by Henderson's men, and Emma becomes a suspect of the murders, since she was the last person who was seen talking to them. Later, Emma and Terry go together to Henderson's night club, and find that Maris is now working there as a performer. Zelda keeps trying to charm Mickey away from Hammond and also tries to make Hammond believe Mickey os selling out to Henderson by tipping him off with a phone call. One of Henderson's men try to make a deal for the next fight with Mickey. Terry sees this and realizes something odd is going on, sensing there is a news story to be written. Terry phones his editor to give him the story, but is instead scolded for missing the double homicide committed at the fight. Terry snatches an envelope that was to be delivered from Henderson to another person, and gives the envelope to Emma to guard for him. He also tells her he suspects Hendeson is about to make Mickey go down for something. Hammond comes to confront Mickey about his dealings with Henderson, and shoots him, sending him to the hospital. Emma helps reconcile Terry and Maris, but Mickey is kidnapped from the hospital, and Emma and Terry concoct a plan to rescue him from his captors. Emma is to pose as Ma Parker and infiltrate the Henderson gang, claiming she knows how to find Crenshaw for them. Henderson swallows the act whole, but when she finally has him convinced, she is kidnapped by Hammond, who rushes in and shoots Henderson. Maris is also taken hostage. Terry manages to follow Hammond and the kidnappers to their hideout. He also brings a police detective, Miller, and they storm the hideout. They catch Hammond, and find all the missing persons, including Crenshaw. When telling his editor about his new scoop, Terry gets promoted, a raise, and a two-week honeymoon holiday. Mickey accompanies Emma to the country and meets her two sisters. Emma plans to trains Mickey in their home, using her Ma Parker attitude to persuade her sisters it is the right thing to do.So's Your Aunt Emma details, tcm.com; accessed September 23, 2015.

River course The Parapet√≠ River arises in the southeastern part of the Cordillera Central of Bolivia. It is formed by the confluence of four rivers, first the Portuguese River (Rio Portuguesa) and the Caravallo (Caraballo) River come together at . Within five kilometers thereafter it is joined by the Misco Mayu River from the right (south) and the Fernandez River from the left (north), whereafter it is known as the Parapet√≠. Its longest tributary, the western fork of the Caravallo River arises at an altitude of 2,679 m on the northeastern slopes of Tihu Kasa mountain, a summit about seven kilometers northeast of Torrecillas, the administrative centre of Las Casas Canton, Azurduy Municipality, Azurduy Province. After being joined by the Fernandez River at Comunidad Rodeo, the Parapet√≠ flows south between the Serrania Alto Fernandez on the west and the Serrania Recete (Serrania Racete) on the east. At 20¬∞20' South latitude it turns east and cuts through the Serrania Recete, meandering past San Juan del Pirai. At San Pablo de Huacareta the Parapet√≠ turns northeast until it is joined by the Rio El Banado from the left (north), and turns generally eastward through Luis Calvo Province, and into the Cordillera Province of Santa Cruz Department. Once in Cordillera Province it turns northeast again forming the southern boundary of Lagunillas Municipality, then turns east into Camiri Municipality, cutting through the Serrania Choreti, past the town of Choreti. The Parapet√≠ then turns south-southeast to the border between Camiri Municipality and Charagua Municipality, where it turns east and then northeast forming the eastern half of the southern border of Camiri Municipality. After the village of Oquita, the Parapet√≠ River enters the Gran Chaco, flows east past San Antonio del Parapeti, and then northeast and then north into the marshes of the Ba√±ados de Izozog. Ba√±ados de Izozog The wetland of the Ba√±ados de Izozog in the Bolivian department of Santa Cruz receives most of its water from the Parapet√≠ River, but also has other smaller tributaries from a predominantly western direction. Much of the water in the Ba√±ados de Izozog eventually evaporates due to the high year-round temperatures. However, in wet years during the rainy season, the marshes overflow and drain into both the Quimome River which flows into Concepci√≥n Lake, and via the Itonomas River into the Amazon River, and a large proportion via surface flow and infiltration takes a southeasterly direction and enters the catchment area of the Paraguay River in the R√≠o de la Plata Basin. On 17 September 2001, the wetlands of the Parapet√≠ River and the Ba√±ados del Izozog were designated under the Ramsar Convention and received international protection. Part of the wetlands was included within the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area.

The 335 kilometres river is a tributary of the Rio Grande. The river runs northwards through the Santa Cruz Department and joins the Mamor√© River. Geography The Yapacan√≠ River originates in the formations of the Ambor√≥ National Park and receives water from numerous rivers and tributary streams. It arises from the confluence of the Yapacan√≠ and Surut√∫ at . From this point the river flows northwest to its mouth in the Rio Grande at . The Yapacan√≠ River shown as a tributary of the Mamor√© River The river forms the border between the municipalities of San Juan and Yapacan√≠, in Ichilo Province of the Santa Cruz Department. Today, the town of La Chancadora, which is located upstream, is threatened by the continuous flooding of the river, since it can be up to 2,600 ft (800m) wide in places. In 2005 work began on the river channeling the Yapacan√≠-Surut√∫. The Piray River is a major tributary. Economy The river Yapacan√≠ has economic significance because of the potential marketable fishing of some species that occur in their waters, as the. The banks of the river have been cleared for agriculture, which has been denounced by some environmental advocacy organizations. Colonization efforts began in Santa Cruz Department in 1954. In 1958, the trail from the Yapacan√≠ River to the Ichilo River was widened with the hope of attracting more agricultural colonists. In 1963, the road west from Montero stopped at the river. Previous efforts to construct a bridge over the river were failures, and the only way to cross it continued to be by boat. Since the river was often high, crossings could be delayed three to four days. In 1966, work began on construction of a bridge which would eliminate river crossings by boat.

Septa are fairly close spaced. The siphuncle is located about half way between the center and the venter with segments that are broadly expanded into the chambers. As typical for the subfamily, Paraloxoceras contains organic endosiphuncular deposits penetrated by a canal system similar to that found in actinocerids but differs in the having a protoconch characteristic of the pseudorthocerids.

Linde Werdelin creates limited and numbered editions of up to 100 pieces. Morten Linde and Jorn Werdelin The Idea Linde Werdelin is a watch and instrument company founded by two Danes, Morten Linde and Jorn Werdelin. The Idea was born out of a skiing accident when, in 1996, Jorn Werdelin, a keen mountaineer and off-piste skier, was taken by surprise in a bout of bad weather, got lost, skied off a cliff and broke his back. In 2002, he partnered with Morten Linde around The Idea: a high-end sportswatch which could, when required, be combined with a digital instrument to provide information for skiing or diving. The ‚Äòwatch-plus-instrument‚Äô idea took five years of research and development before the first Linde Werdelin watch collection went to market in 2006. Linde Werdelin is the only high-end watch company producing digital instruments for skiing and diving. They work with professional mountaineers and divers for product-testing and development. Linde Werdelin watches and instruments were used on the first ever confirmed free climb to the summit Mount Everest in 2007.http://tumblelog.jauderho.com/post/4771312/linde- werdelin-bifometer-instrument-ascent-to-everest Collections The Linde Werdelin watch collection is split between two main groups: the Spido and Oktopus family. The Spidos are further sub-divided into the SpidoSpeeds, which have chronograph complications, and the SpidoLites. The Oktopus are sub- divided into the Double Date and Moonphase which have differing complications. All their watches can also carry both digital instruments as well as be worn with any Linde Werdelin strap. The digital instruments are the Reefhttp://www.lwlounge.com/#!the-reef/c2jc (for diving) and the Rockhttp://www.lwlounge.com/#!the-rock/cl09 (for skiing) and can be considered to be acting as external complications for the watches. While all Linde Werdelin watches are made entirely in Switzerland, the instruments are developed in-house in Denmark. Linde Werdelin is also known for their DLC (Diamond-like Carbon) watches. Their first series of Hard Black DLC watches was launched in October 2008 and sold out instantly.http://home.watchprosite.com/show- forumpost/fi-17/pi-3307916/ti-540176/s-0/ Another aspect of Linde Werdelin, especially prevalent in the Spido family, is the extreme skeletonisation of the case, which is done both for style and to lighten the watch dramatically. This increases the sports aspect and Jorn and Morten found their inspiration for this in the Formula 1 industry. Further reference to the motor racing industry is evident in the SpidoSpeed, from the material used on the dial (which was previously used as dashboards in 1940s racing cars) to the small holes on the subdials resembling the brake discs to the round cut-out details on the strap which make reference to driving gloves. Announced at BaselWorld, Linde Werdelin is launching three new watches for 2014 ‚Äì two of these are in the Spido family and the other is an Oktopus. The SpidoSpeed Rose Gold Black and SpidoSpeed Green take that idea of skeletonisation further than was previously seen in the SpidoLite Tech. These new Spidos are skeletonised not just in the outercase but also into the dial and movement.http://www.lwlounge.com/#!spidospeed/cyvc/Spidospeed%20Rosegold%20black/c12wshttp://www.lwlounge.com/#!spidospeed/cyvc/Spidospeed%20green/c1crt The Linde Werdelin Oktopus is characterised by being able to go down to great depths and the Oktopus MoonLite is no different.http://www.lwlounge.com/#!oktopus-ii/c240/Moonlite/cxia It is made from a special alloy called ALWhttp://www.lindewerdelin.com/thelab/the-beauty- of-alw/https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LindeWerdelinUniverse/posts/PWBLk5owc4d which makes this the lightest Linde Werdelin ever, weighing in at just 62.5 grams total for case and movement. Movement Linde Werdelin watches are exclusively made in Switzerland. In the beginning, ETA SA provided 2892.A2 to implant on earlier models. This movement is one of the most accurate and reliable produced by ETA (less than four seconds per day during quality control).ETA 2892 Linde Werdelin is working with independent watch-makers to craft precision and custom-made movements and it has a very transparent policy that it does not aspire to make any movements itself but would rather prefer to make their watches using the best suppliers available. At BaselWorld 2009, Linde Werdelin presented the SpidoLite,http://horomundi.com/forums/main/read.php?28,3798,3798#msg-3798 which comes with a vintage movement modified by Svend Andersen of Andersen Geneve and founder of AHCI. This marked the beginning of Linde Werdelin‚Äôs ongoing collaboration with independent watch makers.http://home.watchprosite.com/show- forumpost/fi-17/pi-3298111/ti-538851/http://ablogtoread.com/linde- werdelin/new-linde-werdelin-spidolite-titanium-watch-svend-andersen-finished- movement-available-skeletonized-with- dlc/http://forums.timezone.com/index.php?t=tree&goto;=4585200&rid;=0 At BaselWorld 2010 Linde Werdelin launched another movement to realise the first high-end mechanical diving watch with a moonphase, the Oktopus Moonphase. Linde Werdelin launched a series of 29 pieces of the Oktopus Moonphase, with the moonphase complication being built by Danish watchmaker Svend Andersen. It was designed by Fr√©d√©ric Piguet, known for producing high-end complications. Brands like Breguet, for example, are using Fr√©d√©ric Piguet complications in their watches.http://www.watchprosite.com/show- forumpost.classic/fi-1/pi-2204236/ti-358396/s--3/ At BaselWorld 2011 Linde Werdelin launched the LW03. This movement is made by an independent Swiss manufacturer called Concepto, realised by Val√©rien Jaquet. From a watchmaking family, Jaquet has realised this movement only for Linde Werdelin to carry the SpidoSpeed Chronograph. The LW03 carries a calendar and a small second.

Initially the U-boat campaign was directed against the British Grand Fleet. Later U-boat fleet action was extended to include action against the trade routes of the Allied powers. This campaign was highly destructive, and resulted in the loss of nearly half of Britain's merchant marine fleet during the course of the war. To counter the German submarines, the Allies moved shipping into convoys guarded by destroyers, blockades such as the Dover Barrage and minefields were laid, and aircraft patrols monitored the U-boat bases. The U-boat campaign was not able to cut off supplies before the US entered the war in 1917 and in later 1918, the U-boat bases were abandoned in the face of the Allied advance. The tactical successes and failures of the Atlantic U-boat Campaign would later be used as a set of available tactics in World War II in a similar U-boat war against the British Empire.  1914: Initial campaign  First patrols On 6 August 1914, two days after Britain had declared war on Germany, the German U-boats , , , , , , , , , and sailed from their base in Heligoland to attack Royal Navy warships in the North Sea in the first submarine war patrols in history.Gibson and Prendergast 2002, p. 2. The U-boats sailed north, hoping to encounter Royal Navy squadrons between Shetland and Bergen. On 8 August, one of U-9s engines broke down and she was forced to return to base. On the same day, off Fair Isle, U-15 sighted the British battleships , , and on manoeuvres and fired a torpedo at Monarch. This failed to hit, and succeeded only in putting the battleships on their guard. At dawn the next morning, the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron, which was screening the battleships, came into contact with the U-boats, sighting U-15, which was lying on the surface. There was no sign of any lookouts on the U-boat and sounds of hammering could be heard, as though her crew were performing repairs. Birmingham immediately altered course and rammed U-15 just behind her conning tower. The submarine was cut in two and sank with all hands. On 12 August, seven U-boats returned to Heligoland; U-13 was also missing, and it was thought she had been mined. While the operation was a failure, it caused the Royal Navy some uneasiness, disproving earlier estimates as to U-boats' radius of action and leaving the security of the Grand Fleet's unprotected anchorage at Scapa Flow open to question. On the other hand, the ease with which U-15 had been destroyed by Birmingham encouraged the false belief that submarines were no great danger to surface warships. First successes On 5 September 1914, commanded by Lieutenant Otto Hersing made history when he torpedoed the Royal Navy light cruiser . The cruiser's magazine exploded, and the ship sank in four minutes, taking 259 of her crew with her.Halsey, p. 223. It was the first combat victory of the modern submarine. The German U-boats were to get even luckier on 22 September. Early in the morning of that day, a lookout on the bridge of U-9, commanded by Lieutenant Otto Weddigen, spotted a vessel on the horizon. Weddigen ordered the U-boat to submerge immediately, and the submarine went forward to investigate. At closer range, Weddigen discovered three old Royal Navy armoured cruisers, , , and . These three vessels were not merely antiquated, but were staffed mostly by reservists, and were so clearly vulnerable that a decision to withdraw them was already filtering up through the bureaucracy of the Admiralty. The order did not come soon enough for the ships. Weddigen sent one torpedo into Aboukir. The captains of Hogue and Cressy assumed Aboukir had struck a mine and came up to assist. U-9 put two torpedoes into Hogue, and then hit Cressy with two more torpedoes as the cruiser tried to flee. The three cruisers sank in less than an hour, killing 1,460 British sailors.Halsey, pp. 212‚Äì217. Three weeks later, on 15 October, Weddigen also sank the old cruiser , and the crew of U-9 became national heroes. Each was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class, except for Weddigen, who received the Iron Cross First Class. The sinkings caused alarm within the British Admiralty,Halsey, pp. 217‚Äì218. which was increasingly nervous about the security of the Scapa Flow anchorage, and the fleet was sent to ports in Ireland and the west coast of Scotland until adequate defenses were installed at Scapa Flow. This, in a sense, was a more significant victory than sinking a few old cruisers; the world's most powerful fleet had been forced to abandon its home base. End of the first campaign These concerns were well- founded. On 23 November U-18 penetrated Scapa Flow via Hoxa Sound, following a steamer through the boom and entering the anchorage with little difficulty. However, the fleet was absent, being dispersed in anchorages on the west coast of Scotland and Ireland. As U-18 was making her way back out to the open sea, her periscope was spotted by a guard boat. The trawler Dorothy Gray altered course and rammed the periscope, rendering it unserviceable. U-18 then suffered a failure of her diving plane motor and the boat became unable to maintain her depth, at one point even impacting the seabed. Eventually, her captain was forced to surface and scuttle his command, and all but one crew- member were picked up by British boats.Messimer, pp. 36‚Äì37. The last success of the year came on 31 December. sighted the British battleship on manoeuvres in the English Channel and torpedoed her. Formidable sank with the loss of 547 of her crew.Halsey, pp. 221‚Äì222. The C-in-C Channel Fleet, Adm. Sir Lewis Bayly, was criticized for not taking proper precautions during the exercises, but was cleared of the charge of negligence. Bayly later served with distinction as commander of the anti-submarine warfare forces at Queenstown.  1915: War on commerce  First attacks on merchant ships The first attacks on merchant ships had started in October 1914. On 20 October became the first British merchant vessel to be sunk by a German submarine in World War I. Glitra, bound from Grangemouth to Stavanger, Norway, was stopped and searched by U-17, under the command of Kapit√§nleutnant Johannes Feldkirchener. The operation was performed broadly in accordance with the cruiser rules, the crew being ordered into the lifeboats before Glitra was sunk by having her seacocks opened. It was the first time in history a submarine sank a merchant ship. Less than a week later, on 26 October, U-24 became the first submarine to attack an unarmed merchant ship without warning, when she torpedoed the steamship , with 2,500 Belgian refugees aboard. Although the ship did not sink, and was towed into Boulogne, 40 lives were lost, mainly due to panic. The U-boat's commander, Rudolf Schneider, claimed he had mistaken her for a troop transport.Messimer, p. 15. On 30 January 1915, , commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Otto Dr√∂scher, torpedoed and sank the steamers , , and without warning, and on 1 February fired a torpedo at, but missed, the hospital ship , despite her being clearly identifiable as a hospital ship by her white paintwork with green bands and red crosses.Gibson and Prendergast 2002, p. 21 Unrestricted submarine warfare Britons believed before the war that the United Kingdom would starve without North American food; W. T. Stead wrote in 1901 that without it \\"We should be face to face with famine\\". On 4 February 1915, the first unrestricted campaign against Allied trade was started.Halsey, p. 236. The U-boat had several deficiencies for a commerce raider; its low speed, even on the surface, made it scarcely faster than many merchant ships, while its light gun armament was inadequate against larger vessels. To use the U-boat's chief weapon, the attack without warning, using torpedoes, meant abandoning the stop-and-search required to avoid harming neutrals. In the first month 29 ships totalling were sunk, a pace of destruction which was maintained throughout the summer. As the sinkings increased, so too did the number of politically damaging incidents. On 19 February, U-8 torpedoed Belridge, a neutral tanker travelling between two neutral ports; in March U-boats sank Hanna and Medea, a Swedish and a Dutch freighter; in April two Greek vessels. In March also, Falaba was sunk, with the loss of one American life, and in April Harpalyce, a Belgian Relief ship, was sunk. On 7 May, U-20 sank with the loss of 1,198 lives, 128 of them American citizens. These incidents caused outrage amongst neutrals and the scope of the unrestricted campaign was scaled back in September 1915 to lessen the risk of those nations entering the war against Germany.Halsey, pp. 248‚Äì282. British countermeasures were largely ineffective. The most effective defensive measures proved to be advising merchantmen to turn towards the U-boat and attempt to ram, forcing it to submerge.Messimer 2001, p. 31. Over half of all attacks on merchant ships by U-boats were defeated in this way. This response freed the U-boat to attack without warning, however.Holwitt, Joel I. \\"Execute Against Japan\\", PhD dissertation, Ohio State University, 2005, p. 93. On 20 March 1915, this tactic was used by the Great Eastern Railway packet to escape an attack by . For this her captain, Charles Fryatt, was executed after being captured by the Germans in June 1916 provoking international condemnation.Halsey, pp. 310‚Äì312. Another option was arming ships for self-defence, which, according to the Germans, put them outside the protection of the cruiser rules.Holwitt, p. 6.; D√∂nitz, Karl. Memoirs: Ten Years and Twenty Days; von der Poorten, Edward P. The German Navy in World War II (T. Y. Crowell, 1969); Milner, Marc. North Atlantic run: the Royal Canadian Navy and the battle for the convoys (Vanwell Publishing, 2006). Another option was to arm and man decoy ships with hidden guns, the so-called Q-ship. A variant on the idea was to equip small vessels with a submarine escort. In 1915, three U-boats were sunk by Q-ships, and two more by submarines accompanying trawlers.Tarrant 1989, p. 24. In June also was sunk by while attacking Taranaki, and in July U-23 was sunk by C-27 attacking Princess Louise. Also in July U-36 was sunk by the Q-ship Prince Charles, and in August and September and were sunk by , the former in the notorious Baralong Incident. There were, however, no means to detect submerged U-boats, and attacks on them were limited to efforts to damage their periscopes with hammers and dropping guncotton bombs.McKee, Fraser M. \\"An Explosive Story: The Rise and Fall of the Depth Charge\\", in The Northern Mariner (III, #1, January 1993), pp. 46‚Äì47. Use of nets to ensnare U-boats was also examined, as was a destroyer, , fitted with a spar torpedo.McKee, p. 47. In all, 16 U-boats were destroyed during this phase of the campaign, while they themselves sank 370 ships totalling 750,000 GRT.  1916: In support of the High Seas fleet  In 1916 the German Navy returned to a strategy of using the U-boats to erode the Grand Fleet's numerical superiority by staging a series of operations designed to lure the Grand Fleet into a U-boat trap. Due to the U-boats' poor speed compared to the main battle fleet these operations required U-boat patrol lines to be set up, while the High Seas fleet manoeuvred to draw the Grand Fleet to them.Halpern 1995, p. 329. Several of these operations were staged, in March and April 1916, but with no success. Ironically, the major fleet action which did take place, the Battle of Jutland, in May 1916, saw no U-boat involvement at all; the fleets met and engaged largely by chance, and there were no U-boat patrols anywhere near the battle area. A further series of operations, in August and October 1916, were similarly unfruitful, and the strategy was abandoned in favour of resuming commerce warfare.  1917: Renewed \\"unrestricted\\" campaign  In 1917 Germany decided to resume full unrestricted submarine warfare. It was expected to bring America into the war, but the Germans gambled that they could defeat Britain by this means before the US could mobilize. German planners estimated that if the sunk tonnage were to exceed 600,000 tons per month, Britain would be forced to sue for peace after five to six months.Halsey, pp. 335‚Äì343, 364‚Äì366. In February 1917 U-boats sank over 414,000 GRT in the war zone around Britain, 80% of the total for the month; in March they sank over 500,000 (90%), in April over 600,000 of 860,000 GRT, the highest total sinkings of the war. This, however was the high point. In May, the first convoys were introduced, and were immediately successful. Overall losses started to fall; losses to ships in convoy fell dramatically. In the three months following their introduction, on the Atlantic, North Sea, and Scandinavian routes, of 8,894 ships convoyed just 27 were lost to U-boats. By comparison 356 were lost sailing independently. As shipping losses fell, U-boat losses rose; during the period May to July 1917, 15 U-boats were destroyed in the waters around Britain, compared to 9 the previous quarter, and 4 for the quarter before the campaign was renewed.Tarrant 1989, p. 43, 49 and 54. As the campaign became more intense, it also became more brutal. 1917 saw a series of attacks on hospital ships, which generally sailed fully lit, to show their non-combatant status. In January, was sunk by ; in March, by ; in June, by .Grey 1972, p. 243. As U-boats became more wary, encounters with Q-ships also became more intense. In February 1917 was sunk by , but only after Gordon Campbell, Farnboroughs captain, allowed her to be torpedoed in order to get close enough to engage.Grey 1972, p. 177. In March Privet sank U-85 in a 40-minute gun battle, but herself sank before reaching harbour.Grey 1972, p. 179. In April Heather was attacked by U-52 and was badly damaged; the U-boat escaped unscathed. And a few days later Tulip was sunk by whose captain was suspicious of her appearance.Grey 1972, p. 194.  1918: Final year  The convoy system was effective in reducing allied shipping losses, while better weapons and tactics made the escorts more successful at intercepting and attacking U-boats. Shipping losses in Atlantic waters were 98 ships (just over 170,000 GRT) in January; after a rise in February they fell again, and did not rise above that level for the rest of the war.Tarrant 1989, p. 148. In January, six U-boats were destroyed in the theatre; this also became the average loss for the year.Tarrant 1989, p. 75. The Allies continued to try to block access through the Straits of Dover, with the Dover Barrage. Until November 1917 it was ineffective; up to then just two U-boats had been destroyed by the Barrage force, and the Barrage itself had been a magnet for surface raids. After major improvement in the winter of 1917 it became more effective; in the four-month period after mid-December seven U-boats were destroyed trying to transit the area, and by February the High Seas Flotilla boats had abandoned the route in favour of sailing north-about round Scotland, with a consequent loss of effectiveness. The Flanders boats still tried to use the route, but continued to suffer losses, and after March switched their operations to Britain's east coast.Tarrant 1989, pp. 61‚Äì62.Halpern 1995, p. 407. Other measures, particularly against the Flanders flotilla, were the raids on Zeebrugge and Ostend, an attempt to blockade access to the sea. These were largely unsuccessful; the Flanders boats were able to maintain access throughout this period.Halsey, pp. 371‚Äì378. May 1918 saw the only attempt by the Germans to muster a group attack, the forerunner of the wolf-pack, to counter the Allied convoys. In May, six U-boats sailed, under the command of K/L Claus R√ºcker in . On 11 May, U-86 sank one of a pair of ships detached from a convoy in the Channel, but the next day an attack on the troopship led to the destruction of U-103, while was sunk by British submarine . Two more ships were sunk in convoys in the next week, and three independents, but over 100 ships had passed through the groups patrol area in safety.Halpern 1995, p. 427. During the summer, the extension of the convoy system and effectiveness of the escorts made the east coast of Britain as dangerous for the U-boats as the Channel had become. In this period, the Flanders flotilla lost a third of its boats, and in the autumn, losses were at 40%. In October, with the German army in full retreat, the Flanders flotilla was forced to abandon its base at Bruges before it was overrun. A number of boats were scuttled there, while the remainder, just ten boats, returned to bases in Germany. In the summer, too, steps were taken to reduce the effectiveness of the High Seas Flotillas. In 1918, the Allies, particularly the Americans, undertook to create a barrage across the Norwegian Sea, to block U-boat access to the Western Approaches by the north-about route. This huge undertaking involved laying and maintaining minefields and patrols in deep waters over a distance of 300 nautical miles (556 kilometers). The North Sea Mine Barrage saw the laying of over 70,000 mines, mostly by the United States Navy, during the summer of 1918. From September to November 1918, six U-boats were sunk by this measure.Halpern 1995, pp. 438‚Äì441. In July 1918, sailed to Massachusetts and participated in the Attack on Orleans for about an hour. This was the first time that American soil was attacked by a foreign power's artillery since the Siege of Fort Texas in 1846 and one of two places in North America to be subject to attack by the Central Powers. The other was the Battle of Ambos Nogales that was allegedly led by two German spies. On 20 October 1918 Germany suspends submarine warfare, and on 11 November 1918, World War I ended. The last task of the U-Boat Arm was in helping to quell the Wilhelmshaven mutiny, which had broken out when the High Seas Fleet was ordered to sea for a final, doomed sortie. After the Armistice, the remaining U-boats joined the High Seas Fleet in surrender, and were interned at Harwich. Of the 12.5 million tons of Allied shipping destroyed in World War I, over 8 million tons, two-thirds of the total, had been sunk in the waters of the Atlantic war zone. Of the 178 U-boats destroyed during the war, 153 had been from the Atlantic forces, 77 from the much larger High Seas Flotillas and 76 from the much smaller Flanders force.

In most cases where a chiral compound is biologically active, one enantiomer is more active than the other. The eudysmic ratio is the ratio of activity between the two. A eudysmic ratio significantly differing from 1 means that they are statistically different in activity.  Terminology  The eutomer is the chiral enantiomer having the desired pharmacological activity, e.g., as an active ingredient in a drug. The distomer, on the other hand, is the enantiomer of the eutomer which may have undesired bioactivity or may be bio- inert. A racemic mixture is an equal mixture of both enantiomers, which may be easier to manufacture than a single enantiomeric form. It is often the case that only a single one of the enantiomers contains all of the wanted bioactivity, the distomer is often less active, has no desired activity or may even be toxic. In some cases the eudysmic ratio is so high that it is desired to separate out the two enantiomers instead of leaving it as a racemic product. It is also possible that the distomer is not simply completely inactive but actually antagonizes the effects of the eutomer. Alternatively, it is possible that the distomer converts in the body into the eutomer, at least partly.  Calculation  One way the eudysmic ratio is computed is by dividing the EC50 or the IC50 of the eutomer by the same measurement of the distomer. Whether one chooses to use the EC50 or IC50 depends on the drug in question.  Examples  * Citalopram is a case example of such a compound, and steps were taken to separate out the weaker enantiomer. * Thalidomide is a drug whose two enantiomers cause distinctly different effects from one another. This is an example where the two enantiomers of a drug have different pharmacologic effects. * Methorphan is another drug whose two enantiomers possess very different binding profiles, with the L enantiomer being a potent opioid analgesic, and the D enantiomer being a commonly used over-the-counter cough suppressant which acts as an NMDA-antagonist but possesses nearly no opioid activity. In the case of morphinan the eudysmic ratio is preserved after metabolism as the D and L metabolites possess the same pharmacological targets as the corresponding methorphan enantiomers, but are considerably more potent than their parent compounds. * Amino acids are also a very interesting example of eudysmic ratio. Nearly all of the amino acids in the human body are called \\"L\\" amino acids; despite being chiral, the body almost exclusively creates and uses amino acids in this one configuration. D amino acids, the enantiomers - or \\"mirror images\\" - of the amino acids in the human body cannot be incorporated into proteins. D-aspartate and D-serine are two notable counterexamples, since they do not appear to ever be incorporated into proteins, but instead act individually as signalling molecules. However, mammals can metabolize significant amount of D amino acids by oxidizing them to alpha-ketoacids (most of which are non-chiral) and then transaminases can create L amino acids. There are no reasons to believe that humans are exceptional, they have all required enzymes (DDO, DAO). Some common foods contain near-racemic mixtures of amino acids.

First used in this sense in 1924, the term was introduced to sociology in 1976 by Ivan Illich, alleging that industrialized societies impair quality of life by overmedicalizing life.\\"iatrogenesis\\", A Dictionary of Sociology, Encyclopedia.com. updated 31 May 2020. Iatrogenesis may thus include mental suffering via medical beliefs or a practitioner's statements.David Kuhl, What Dying People Want: Practical Wisdom for the End of Life (New York: PublicAffairs, 2002), p 55.Paul F. Lazarsfeld, \\"Working with Merton\\", in Lewis A. Cosar, ed., The Idea of Social Structure: Papers in Honor of Robert K. Merton (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2012 / New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1975), indexing \\"iatrogenesis\\", esp. pp 328‚Äì329. Some iatrogenic events are obvious, like amputation of the wrong limb, whereas others, like drug interactions, can evade recognition. In a 2013 estimate, about 20 million negative effects from treatment had occurred globally. In 2013, an estimated 142,000 persons died from adverse effects of medical treatment, up from an estimated 94,000 in 1990. Iatrogenic avenues Risk associated with medical interventions *Adverse effects of prescription drugs * Overuse of drugs (causing, for example, antibiotic resistance in bacteria) * Prescription drug interaction  Medical errors  * Incorrect prescription, perhaps due to illegible handwriting or computer typos * Faulty procedures, techniques, information, methods, or equipment * Negligence * Nosocomial infections Causes and consequences Medical error and negligence Iatrogenic conditions do not necessarily result from medical errors, such as mistakes made in surgery, or the prescription or dispensing of the wrong therapy, such as a drug. In fact, intrinsic and sometimes adverse effects of a medical treatment are iatrogenic. For example, radiation therapy and chemotherapy ‚Äî necessarily aggressive for therapeutic effect ‚Äì frequently produce such iatrogenic effects as hair loss, hemolytic anemia, diabetes insipidus, vomiting, nausea, brain damage, lymphedema, infertility, etc. The loss of function resulting from the required removal of a diseased organ is iatrogenic, as in the case of diabetes consequential to the removal of all or part of the pancreas. The incidence of iatrogenesis may be misleading in some cases. For example, ruptured aortic aneurysm is fatal in most cases; the survival rate for a ruptured aortic aneurysm is under 25%. Patients who die during or after an operation will still be considered iatrogenic deaths, but the procedure itself remains a better bet than the 100% probability of death if left untreated. Other situations may involve actual negligence or faulty procedures, such as when pharmacotherapists produce handwritten prescriptions for drugs. Adverse effects A very common iatrogenic effect is caused by drug interaction, i.e., when pharmacotherapists fail to check for all medications a patient is taking and prescribe new ones that interact agonistically or antagonistically (thereby potentiating or attenuating the intended therapeutic effect). Such situations can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Adverse reactions, such as allergic reactions to drugs, even when unexpected by pharmacotherapists, are also classified as iatrogenic. The evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is iatrogenic as well. Bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics have evolved in response to the overprescription of antibiotic drugs. Certain drugs are toxic in their own right in therapeutic doses because of their mechanism of action. Alkylating antineoplastic agents, for example, cause DNA damage, which is more harmful to cancer cells than regular cells. However, alkylation causes severe side- effects and is actually carcinogenic in its own right, with potential to lead to the development of secondary tumors. In a similar manner, arsenic-based medications like melarsoprol, used to treat trypanosomiasis, can cause arsenic poisoning. Adverse effects can appear mechanically. The design of some surgical instruments may be decades old, hence certain adverse effects (such as tissue trauma) may never have been properly characterized. Psychiatry In psychiatry, iatrogenesis can occur due to misdiagnosis (including diagnosis with a false condition, as was the case of hystero-epilepsy). An example of a partially iatrogenic condition due to common misdiagnosis is bipolar disorder, especially in pediatric patients. Other conditions such as somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome are theorized to have significant sociocultural and iatrogenic components. Posttraumatic stress disorder is hypothesized to be prone to iatrogenic complications based on treatment modality. Even use of antipsychotic drugs leads to loss of brain mass The psychiatric treatment of some conditions and populations, such as substance abuse, and antisocial youths are regarded as carrying significant risks for iatrogenesis. At the other end of the spectrum, dissociative identity disorder is considered by a minority of theorists to be a wholly iatrogenic disorder with the bulk of diagnoses arising from a tiny fraction of practitioners. The degree of association of any particular condition with iatrogenesis is unclear and in some cases controversial. The over-diagnosis of psychiatric conditions (with the assignment of mental illness terminology) may relate primarily to clinician dependence on subjective criteria. The assignment of pathological nomenclature is rarely a benign process and can easily rise to the level of emotional iatrogenesis, especially when no alternatives outside of the diagnostic naming process have been considered. Many former patients come to the conclusion that their difficulties are largely the result of the power relationships inherent in psychiatric treatment, which has led to the rise of the anti-psychiatry movement. Iatrogenic poverty Meessen et al. used the term \\"iatrogenic poverty\\" to describe impoverishment induced by medical care. Impoverishment is described for households exposed to catastrophic health expenditure or to hardship financing. Every year, worldwide, over 100,000 households fall into poverty due to health care expenses. A study reported that in the United States in 2001, illness and medical debt caused half of all personal bankruptcies. Especially in countries in economic transition, the willingness to pay for health care is increasing, and the supply side does not stay behind and develops very fast. But the regulatory and protective capacity in those countries is often lagging behind. Patients easily fall into a vicious cycle of illness, ineffective therapies, consumption of savings, indebtedness, sale of productive assets, and eventually poverty. Social and cultural iatrogenesis The 20th-century social critic Ivan Illich broadened the concept of medical iatrogenesis in his 1974 book Medical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health by defining it at three levels. *First, clinical iatrogenesis is the injury done to patients by ineffective, unsafe, and erroneous treatments as described above. In this regard, he described the need for evidence-based medicine 20 years before the term was coined. *Second, at another level social iatrogenesis is the medicalization of life in which medical professionals, pharmaceutical companies, and medical device companies have a vested interest in sponsoring sickness by creating unrealistic health demands that require more treatments or treating non-diseases that are part of the normal human experience, such as age-related declines. In this way, aspects of medical practice and medical industries can produce social harm in which society members ultimately become less healthy or excessively dependent on institutional care. He argued that medical education of physicians contributes to medicalization of society because they are trained predominantly for diagnosing and treating illness, therefore they focus on disease rather than on health. Iatrogenic poverty (above) can be considered a specific manifestation of social iatrogenesis. *Third, cultural iatrogenesis refers to the destruction of traditional ways of dealing with, and making sense of, death, suffering, and sickness. In this way the medicalization of life leads to cultural harm as society members lose their autonomous coping skills. It is worth noting that in these critiques \\"Illich does not reject all benefits of modern society but rejects those that involve unwarranted dependency and exploitation.\\" Epidemiology Globally it is estimated that 142,000 people died in 2013 from adverse effects of medical treatment, an increase of 51 percent from 94,000 in 1990. In the United States, estimated deaths per year include: * 12,000 due to unnecessary surgery * 7,000 due to medication errors in hospitals * 20,000 due to other errors in hospitals * 80,000 due to nosocomial infections in hospitals * 106,000 due to non-error, negative effects of drugs Based on these figures, iatrogenesis may cause as many as 225,000 deaths per year in the United States (excluding recognizable error). An earlier Institute of Medicine report estimated 230,000 to 284,000 iatrogenic deaths annually. History Evidence demonstrating the advent of pathological anatomy in 1823 Vienna (left vertical line) correlated with incidence of fatal childbed fever. The onset of chlorine handwash in 1847 is noted (right vertical line). For comparison, rates for Dublin maternity hospital, which had no pathological anatomy (view rates). Semmelweis 1861. The term iatrogenesis means brought forth by a healer, from the Greek ·º∞Œ±œÑœÅœåœÇ (iatros, \\"healer\\") and Œ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµœÉŒπœÇ (genesis, \\"origin\\"); as such, in its earlier forms, it could refer to good or bad effects. Since at least the time of Hippocrates, people have recognized the potentially damaging effects of medical intervention. \\"First do no harm\\" (primum non nocere) is a primary Hippocratic mandate in modern medical ethics. Iatrogenic illness or death caused purposefully or by avoidable error or negligence on the healer's part became a punishable offense in many civilizations. The transfer of pathogens from the autopsy room to maternity patients, leading to shocking historical mortality rates of puerperal fever (also known as \\"childbed fever\\") at maternity institutions in the 19th century, was a major iatrogenic catastrophe of the era. The infection mechanism was first identified by Ignaz Semmelweis. With the development of scientific medicine in the 20th century, it could be expected that iatrogenic illness or death might be more easily avoided. Antiseptics, anesthesia, antibiotics, better surgical techniques, evidence- based protocols and best practices continue to be developed to decrease iatrogenic side effects and mortality.

He was Regent of Sweden, under the Kalmar Union, in 1457, shared with Erik Axelsson (Tott), and alone 1465‚Äì1466. Biography  Family  J√∂ns Bengtsson was a member of the illustrious Oxenstierna family, various representatives of which had already become prominent in the public life of Sweden. His father was Privy Councillor Bengt J√∂nsson Oxenstierna and his mother was Kristina Kristiernsdotter Vasa, daughter of Lord High Justiciar Kristiern Nilsson Vasa.  Education and academic career  He studied at the University of Leipzig and returned in 1438 to Sweden with a magister in artibus degree. On his return he was made Archpriest of the chapter of Uppsala Cathedral. Shortly afterwards his father was made Lawspeaker of the province of Uppland and Castellan of Ringstaholm Castle by the Privy Council. In 1440 he attended the Riksm√∂te in Arboga where the Danish King Christopher of Bavaria was elected King of Sweden, and took part in two Kalmar Union meetings in 1441 as a Swedish representative. There are no Swedish sources mentioning J√∂ns Bengtsson in the period between 1442 and 1447, during which he likely returned to Germany to further his academic studies in canon law. He is mentioned as decretorum baccalaureus and Rector of the University of Leipzig for the summer term of 1445.Gillingstam, Hans (1994) J√∂ns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna), Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, Band 28 (1992‚Äì1994), p. 496, online version retrieved on 17 June 2015.  Archbishop  Shortly after his father Bengt J√∂nsson and uncle Nils J√∂nsson Oxenstierna were named Co-regents, J√∂ns Bengtsson was elected archbishop in February 1448. He asked the Council of Basel for a confirmation of his election, and he had himself consecrated (30 June 1448) by his suffragans, the day after they had crowned Charles VIII as King. On 1 July, Bengtsson crowned the queen. The confirmation of his appointment by Pope Nicholas V did not reach him until the ensuing year. In 1457, as Archbishop of Uppsala, he received from the pope the title of Primate of Sweden; the Archbishops of Lund, however, were permitted to retain their title of Primate of the Church of Sweden. As Charles, to escape from money troubles, increased taxes and confiscated church property, dissatisfaction spread among clergy and people, and Bengtsson placed himself at the head of the opposition (1457). Entering Uppsala Cathedral, he laid aside his pontifical insignia, took up helmet, breastplate, and sword, and announced his intention not to resume his pontifical robes until Charles should be banished from the country. The King was forced to yield and went into exile in Danzig. Thereupon Christian I of Denmark was formally recognized King of Sweden, and crowned at Stockholm by Bengtsson. General discontent soon followed, especially when Christian, on becoming heir to his uncle, Duke Adolph of Holstein, found himself in great financial straits. To meet his obligations, he levied enormous taxes, even in Sweden, without exempting ecclesiastics, religious foundations, or the moneys collected by papal mandate to defray the expenses of a crusade against the Turks. During a temporary absence of Christian I in Finland, the archbishop held the regency of Sweden; seeing the people in revolt against him and the heavy imposts, he took up their cause and suspended the collection of taxes. The king showed his displeasure by arresting the archbishop and sending him to Denmark. A revolution broke out afresh in Sweden, led by his cousin Kettil Karlsson Vasa, Bishop of Link√∂ping, who defeated Christian I's army at the Battle of Haraker in 1464, becoming de facto regent. Charles VIII was recalled to the throne, and Christian I, to recover the country, became reconciled with his prisoner. Bengtsson went at once to Sweden, where he roused the people against Charles, whom he excommunicated. The archbishop succeeded finally in bringing about Charles' abdication, and the recognition of Christian I once more as King of Sweden. In reality, however, the archbishop held the effective reins of power and administered affairs as though he were the actual sovereign. He was unable to sustain this r√¥le. Discontented factions combined against him and, in 1466, elected Erik Axelsson Tott as regent, whereupon Bengtsson was compelled to retire. Dissensions continued, and the king of the Swedish party, Charles VIII, once more took the place of the king who represented the union of the three countries. The archbishop found an asylum with his friend Magnus Gren, on the island of √ñland. Here he died at Borgholm on 15 December 1467, \\"poor and exiled, regretted by no one, hated by many, and feared by all\\". Overview The key to the political activity of Bengtsson is to be found in the ambition that was a part of his character ‚Äî ambition for his family and his country. There was a strong antagonism between the great Oxenstierna family, to which the archbishop belonged, and the Bonde family, of which the king, supported by the national party, was member. Moreover, the archbishop was aware that the nobility and the leading men of Sweden, before the Union of Kalmar, had in general failed to respect the clergy and the property of the Church. In a union of Sweden with Denmark and Norway, he foresaw a limitation of the power of the Swedish nobles; in his character of archbishop, it was clear to him that such curtailment would be a safeguard to the temporalities of the Church.

During the multinational occupation of post‚ÄìWorld War II Germany, the Soviet Union blocked the Western Allies' railway, road, and canal access to the sectors of Berlin under Western control. The Soviets offered to drop the blockade if the Western Allies withdrew the newly introduced Deutsche Mark from West Berlin. The Western Allies organised the Berlin Airlift (also known as Berliner Luftbr√ºcke, literally \\"Berlin Air Bridge\\" in German language) from 26 June 1948 to 30 September 1949 to carry supplies to the people of West Berlin, a difficult feat given the size of the city's population. The Americans and British then began a joint operation in support of the entire city. Aircrews from the American, British, French, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and South African air forces flew over 200,000 sorties in one year, providing to the West Berliners necessities such as fuel and food, with the original plan being to lift 3,475 tons of supplies daily. By the spring of 1949, that number was often met twofold, with the peak daily delivery totalling 12,941 tons.The American People: Creating a Nation and a Society. New York: Pearson Longman, 2008. P 828. On 12 May 1949, the USSR lifted the blockade of West Berlin, although for a time the Americans and British continued to supply the city by air anyway because they were worried that the Soviets were simply going to resume the blockade and were only trying to disrupt western supply lines. The Berlin Airlift officially ended on 30 September 1949 after fifteen months. The US Air Force had delivered 1,783,573 tons (76.40% of total) and the RAF 541,937 tons (23.30% of total),A fleet of 104 varied transports from 25 civilian companies was integrated into Operation Plainfare and brought in 146,980 tons or 27% of the RAF tonnage (Miller 1998 p. 40) totalling 2,334,374 tons, nearly two-thirds of which was coal, on 278,228 flights to Berlin. The C-47s and C-54s together flew over in the process, almost the distance from Earth to the Sun.Berlin Airlift: Logistics, Humanitarian Aid, and Strategic Success , Major Gregory C. Tine, Army Logistician At the height of the Airlift, one plane reached West Berlin every thirty seconds. Seventeen American and eight British aircraft crashed during the operation. A total of 101 fatalities were recorded as a result of the operation, including 40 Britons and 31 Americans, mostly due to non-flying accidents. The Berlin Blockade served to highlight the competing ideological and economic visions for postwar Europe and played a major role in drawing West Germany into the NATO orbit several years later in 1955. Postwar division of Germany The red area of Germany (above) is Soviet controlled East Germany. German territory east of the Oder-Neisse line (light beige) was ceded to Poland, while a portion of the easternmost section of Germany East Prussia, K√∂nigsberg, was annexed by the USSR, as the Kaliningrad Oblast. From 17 July to 2 August 1945, the victorious Allies reached the Potsdam Agreement on the fate of postwar Europe, calling for the division of defeated Germany into four temporary occupation zones (thus re-affirming principles laid out earlier by the Yalta Conference). These zones were located roughly around the then- current locations of the allied armies. Also divided into occupation zones, Berlin was located inside Soviet-controlled eastern Germany. The United States, United Kingdom, and France controlled western portions of the city, while Soviet troops controlled the eastern sector. Soviet zone and the Allies' rights of access to Berlin Sectors of divided Berlin air corridors to Berlin In the eastern zone, the Soviet authorities forcibly unified the Communist Party of Germany and Social Democratic Party (SPD) in the Socialist Unity Party (\\"SED\\"), claiming at the time that it would not have a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist or Soviet orientation. The SED leaders then called for the \\"establishment of an anti-fascist, democratic regime, a parliamentary democratic republic\\" while the Soviet Military Administration suppressed all other political activities. Factories, equipment, technicians, managers and skilled personnel were removed to the Soviet Union. In a June 1945 meeting, Stalin informed German communist leaders that he expected to slowly undermine the British position within their occupation zone, that the United States would withdraw within a year or two and that nothing would then stand in the way of a united Germany under communist control within the Soviet orbit. Stalin and other leaders told visiting Bulgarian and Yugoslavian delegations in early 1946 that Germany must be both Soviet and communist. A further factor contributing to the Blockade was that there had never been a formal agreement guaranteeing rail and road access to Berlin through the Soviet zone. At the end of the war, western leaders had relied on Soviet goodwill to provide them with access. At that time, the western allies assumed that the Soviets' refusal to grant any cargo access other than one rail line, limited to ten trains per day, was temporary, but the Soviets refused expansion to the various additional routes that were later proposed. The Soviets also granted only three air corridors for access to Berlin from Hamburg, B√ºckeburg, and Frankfurt. In 1946 the Soviets stopped delivering agricultural goods from their zone in eastern Germany, and the American commander, Lucius D. Clay, responded by stopping shipments of dismantled industries from western Germany to the Soviet Union. In response, the Soviets started a public relations campaign against American policy and began to obstruct the administrative work of all four zones of occupation. Until the blockade began in 1948, the Truman Administration had not decided whether American forces should remain in West Berlin after the establishment of a West German government, planned for 1949.Larson (2011) Focus on Berlin and the elections of 1946 Berlin quickly became the focal point of both US and Soviet efforts to re-align Europe to their respective visions. As Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov noted, \\"What happens to Berlin, happens to Germany; what happens to Germany, happens to Europe.\\"Airbridge to Berlin, \\"Background on Conflict\\" chapter Berlin had suffered enormous damage; its prewar population of 4.3 million people was reduced to 2.8 million. After harsh treatment, forced emigration, political repression and the particularly hard winter of 1945‚Äì1946, Germans in the Soviet-controlled zone were hostile to Soviet endeavours. Local elections in 1946 resulted in a massive anti-communist protest vote, especially in the Soviet sector of Berlin. Berlin's citizens overwhelmingly elected non-Communist members to its city government. Political division Moves towards a West German state The US had secretly decided that a unified and neutral Germany would inevitably fall under Soviet Domination, with Ambassador Walter Bedell Smith telling General Eisenhower that \\"in spite of our announced position, we really do not want nor intend to accept German unification on any terms that the Russians might agree to, even though they seem to meet most of our requirements.\\" American planners had privately decided during the war that it would need a strong, allied Germany to assist in the rebuilding of the West European economy. To coordinate the economies of the British and United States occupation zones, these were combined on 1 January 1947 into what was referred to as the Bizone (renamed \\"the Trizone\\" when France joined on 1 June 1948). After March 1946 the British zonal advisory board (Zonenbeirat) was established, with representatives of the states, the central offices, political parties, trade unions, and consumer organisations. As indicated by its name, the zonal advisory board had no legislative power, but was merely advisory. The Control Commission for Germany ‚Äì British Element made all decisions with its legislative power. In reaction to the Soviet and British advances, in October 1945 the Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS) encouraged the states in the US zone to form a co-ordinating body, the so-called L√§nderrat (council of states), with the power to legislate for the entire US zone. It created its own central bodies (Aussch√ºsse or joint interstate committees) headed by a secretariat seated in Stuttgart. While the British and Soviet central administrations were allied institutions, these US zone committees were not OMGUS subdivisions, but instead were autonomous bodies of German self-rule under OMGUS supervision. Representatives of these three governments, along with the Benelux nations, met twice in London (London 6-Power Conference) in the first half of 1948 to discuss the future of Germany, going ahead despite Soviet threats to ignore any resulting decisions. Eventually the London Agreement on German External Debts, also known as the London Debt Agreement (German: Londoner Schuldenabkommen), was concluded. Under the London Debts Agreement of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50% to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, and compared to the fast- growing German economy were of minor impact.Timothy W. Guinnane, \\"Financial Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung: The 1953 London Debt Agreement\\" (Economic Growth Center, Yale University, 2004) pp. 17, 20‚Äì21, 27‚Äì28, 30 In response to the announcement of the first of these meetings, in late January 1948, the Soviets began stopping British and American trains to Berlin to check passenger identities. As outlined in an announcement on 7 March 1948, all of the governments present approved the extension of the Marshall Plan to Germany, finalised the economic merger of the western occupation zones in Germany and agreed upon the establishment of a federal system of government for them. After a 9 March meeting between Stalin and his military advisers, a secret memorandum was sent to Molotov on 12 March 1948, outlining a plan to force the policy of the western allies into line with the wishes of the Soviet government by \\"regulating\\" access to Berlin. The Allied Control Council (ACC) met for the last time on 20 March 1948, when Vasily Sokolovsky demanded to know the outcome of the London Conference and, on being told by negotiators that they had not yet heard the final results from their governments, he said, \\"I see no sense in continuing this meeting, and I declare it adjourned.\\" The entire Soviet delegation rose and walked out. Truman later noted, \\"For most of Germany, this act merely formalised what had been an obvious fact for some time, namely, that the four-power control machinery had become unworkable. For the city of Berlin, however, this was an indication for a major crisis.\\"Airbridge to Berlin, \\"Eye of the Storm\\" chapter April Crisis and the Little Air Lift On 25 March 1948, the Soviets issued orders restricting Western military and passenger traffic between the American, British and French occupation zones and Berlin. These new measures began on 1 April along with an announcement that no cargo could leave Berlin by rail without the permission of the Soviet commander. Each train and truck was to be searched by the Soviet authorities. On 2 April, General Clay ordered a halt to all military trains and required that supplies to the military garrison be transported by air, in what was dubbed the \\"Little Lift.\\" The Soviets eased their restrictions on Allied military trains on 10 April 1948, but continued periodically to interrupt rail and road traffic during the next 75 days, while the United States continued supplying its military forces by using cargo aircraft. Some 20 flights a day continued through June, building up stocks of food against future Soviet actions, so that by the time the blockade began at the end of June, at least 18 days' supply per major food type, and in some types, much more, had been stockpiled that provided time to build up the ensuing airlift. At the same time, Soviet military aircraft began to violate West Berlin airspace and would harass, or what the military called \\"buzz\\", flights in and out of West Berlin. On 5 April, a Soviet Air Force Yakovlev Yak-3 fighter collided with a British European Airways Vickers Viking 1B airliner near RAF Gatow airfield, killing all aboard both aircraft. The Gatow air disaster exacerbated tensions between the Soviets and the other allied powers. Internal Soviet reports in April stated that \\"Our control and restrictive measures have dealt a strong blow to the prestige of the Americans and British in Germany\\" and that the Americans have \\"admitted\\" that the idea of an airlift would be too expensive. On 9 April, Soviet officials demanded that American military personnel maintaining communication equipment in the Eastern zone must withdraw, thus preventing the use of navigation beacons to mark air routes. On 20 April, the Soviets demanded that all barges obtain clearance before entering the Soviet zone. Currency crisis Creation of an economically stable western Germany required reform of the unstable Reichsmark German currency introduced after the 1920s German inflation. The Soviets continued the debasing of the Reichsmark, which had undergone severe inflation during the war, by excessive printing, resulting in many Germans using cigarettes as a de facto currency or for bartering. The Soviets opposed western plans for a reform. They interpreted the new currency as an unjustified, unilateral decision, and responded by cutting all land links between West Berlin and West Germany. The Soviets believed that the only currency that should be allowed to circulate was the currency that they issued themselves.. N. pag. Print. Anticipating the introduction of a new currency by the other countries in the non-Soviet zones, the Soviet Union in May 1948 directed its military to introduce its own new currency and to permit only the Soviet currency to be used in their sector of Berlin, if the other countries brought in a different currency there. On 18 June the United States, Britain and France announced that on 21 June the Deutsche Mark would be introduced, but the Soviets refused to permit its use as legal tender in Berlin. The Allies had already transported 250,000,000 Deutsche marks into the city and it quickly became the standard currency in all four sectors. Against the wishes of the Soviets, the new currency, along with the Marshall Plan that backed it, appeared to have the potential to revitalise Germany. Stalin looked to force the Western nations to abandon Berlin. Start of the Berlin Airlift Beginning of the blockade The day after the 18 June 1948 announcement of the new Deutsche Mark, Soviet guards halted all passenger trains and traffic on the autobahn to Berlin, delayed Western and German freight shipments and required that all water transport secure special Soviet permission. On 21 June, the day the Deutsche Mark was introduced, the Soviet military halted a United States military supply train to Berlin and sent it back to western Germany. On 22 June, the Soviets announced that they would introduce a new currency in their zone. That same day, a Soviet representative told the other three occupying powers that \\"We are warning both you and the population of Berlin that we shall apply economic and administrative sanctions that will lead to the circulation in Berlin exclusively of the currency of the Soviet occupation zone.\\" The Soviets launched a massive propaganda campaign condemning Britain, the United States and France by radio, newspaper and loudspeaker. The Soviets conducted well-advertised military maneuvers just outside the city. Rumors of a potential occupation by Soviet troops spread quickly. German communists demonstrated, rioted and attacked pro-West German leaders attending meetings for the municipal government in the Soviet sector. On 24 June, the Soviets severed land and water connections between the non- Soviet zones and Berlin. That same day, they halted all rail and barge traffic in and out of Berlin. The West answered by introducing a counter-blockade, stopping all rail traffic into East Germany from the British and US zones. Over the following months this counter-blockade would have a damaging impact on East Germany, as the drying up of coal and steel shipments seriously hindered industrial development in the Soviet zone. On 25 June, the Soviets stopped supplying food to the civilian population in the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin. Motor traffic from Berlin to the western zones was permitted, but this required a detour to a ferry crossing because of alleged \\"repairs\\" to a bridge. They also cut off the electricity relied on by Berlin, using their control over the generating plants in the Soviet zone. Surface traffic from non-Soviet zones to Berlin was blockaded, leaving open only the air corridors. The Soviets rejected arguments that the occupation rights in the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin and the use of the supply routes during the previous three years had given Britain, France and the United States a legal claim to use of the highways, tunnels, railroads, and canals. Relying on Soviet goodwill after the war, Britain, France, and the United States had never negotiated an agreement with the Soviets to guarantee these land-based rights of access to Berlin through the Soviet zone. At the time, West Berlin had 36 days' worth of food, and 45 days' worth of coal. Militarily, the Americans and British were greatly outnumbered because of the postwar scaling back of their armies. The United States, like other western countries, had disbanded most of its troops and was largely inferior in the European theatre. The entire United States Army had been reduced to 552,000 men by February 1948. Military forces in the western sectors of Berlin numbered only 8,973 Americans, 7,606 British and 6,100 French. Of the 98,000 American troops in West Germany in March 1948, only 31,000 were combat forces, and only one reserve division was immediately available in the United States. Soviet military forces in the Soviet sector that surrounded Berlin totaled 1.5 million. The two United States regiments in Berlin could have provided little resistance against a Soviet attack. Because of the imbalance, US war plans were based on using hundreds of atomic bombs, but only about 50 Fat Man-specification bombs, the only version available to the US military, existed in mid-1948. In March 1948, only 35 \\"Silverplate\\" atomic-capable Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers‚Äîjust over half of the 65 Silverplate specification B-29 aircraft built through the end of 1947‚Äîand a few trained flight and assembly crews were available. Three B-29 groups arrived in Europe in July and August 1948.The 28th and 307th Bomb Groups were deployed to England, while the 301st Bomb Group were assigned to F√ºrstenfeldbruck, Germany. In all, about 90 conventionally-armed B-29s were assigned. Despite the intention to signal the threat of the West's ability to retaliate with nuclear weapons if necessary, the Soviets possibly knew that none of the bombers were atomic-capable. The first Silverplate bombers only arrived to Europe near the end of the crisis in April 1949. General Lucius D. Clay, in charge of the US Occupation Zone in Germany, summed up the reasons for not retreating in a cable to Washington, D.C. on 13 June 1948: Believing that Britain, France, and the United States had little option than to acquiesce, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany celebrated the beginning of the blockade. General Clay felt that the Soviets were bluffing about Berlin since they would not want to be viewed as starting a Third World War. He believed that Stalin did not want a war and that Soviet actions were aimed at exerting military and political pressure on the West to obtain concessions, relying on the West's prudence and unwillingness to provoke a war. Commander of United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) General Curtis LeMay reportedly favoured an aggressive response to the blockade, in which his B-29s with fighter escort would approach Soviet air bases while ground troops attempted to reach Berlin; Washington vetoed the plan. Decision for an airlift Although the ground routes had never been negotiated, the same was not true of the air. On 30 November 1945, it had been agreed in writing that there would be three twenty-mile-wide air corridors providing free access to Berlin.spiritoffreedom.org: The Berlin Airlift Additionally, unlike a force of tanks and trucks, the Soviets could not claim that cargo aircraft were a military threat. The airlift option critically depended on scale and effectiveness. If the supplies could not be flown in fast enough, Soviet help would eventually be needed to prevent starvation. Clay was told to take advice from General LeMay to see if an airlift was possible. Initially taken aback by the inquiry, which was \\"Can you haul coal?\\", LeMay replied, \\"We can haul anything.\\" When American forces consulted Britain's Royal Air Force about a possible joint airlift, they learned the RAF was already running an airlift in support of British troops in Berlin. General Clay's counterpart, General Sir Brian Robertson, was ready with some concrete numbers. During the Little Lift in April 1948, British Air Commodore Reginald Waite had calculated the resources required to support the entire city. The American military government, based on a minimum daily ration of 1,990 kilocalories (July 1948), set a total of daily supplies needed at 646 tons of flour and wheat, 125 tons of cereal, 64 tons of fat, 109 tons of meat and fish, 180 tons of dehydrated potatoes, 180 tons of sugar, 11 tons of coffee, 19 tons of powdered milk, 5 tons of whole milk for children, 3 tons of fresh yeast for baking, 144 tons of dehydrated vegetables, 38 tons of salt and 10 tons of cheese. In all, 1,534 tons were required each day to sustain the over two million people of Berlin. Additionally, for heat and power, 3,475 tons of coal, diesel and petrol were also required daily.pbs.org: The Berlin Airlift C-47 Skytrains unloading at Tempelhof Airport during the Berlin Airlift Carrying all this in would not be easy. The postwar demobilisation left the US forces in Europe with only two groups of C-47 Skytrain transports (the military version of the Douglas DC-3, which the British called the \\"Dakota\\"), nominally 96 aircraft, each of which could carry about 3.5 tons of cargo. LeMay believed that \\"with an all-out effort\\" of 100 daily round trips these would be able to haul about 300 tons of supplies a day. The RAF was somewhat better prepared, since it had already moved some aircraft into the German area, and they expected to be able to supply about 400 tons a day. This was not nearly enough to move the 5,000 tons a day that would be needed, but these numbers could be increased as new aircraft arrived from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The RAF would be relied on to increase its numbers quickly. It could fly additional aircraft in from Britain in a single hop, bringing the RAF fleet to about 150 Dakotas and 40 of the larger Avro Yorks with a 10-ton payload. With this fleet, the British contribution was expected to rise to 750 tons a day in the short term, albeit at the cost of suspending all air traffic except for the airlift to Berlin and Warsaw. For a longer-term operation, the US would have to add additional aircraft as soon as possible, and those would have to be as large as possible while still able to fly into the Berlin airports. Only one aircraft type was suitable, the four-engined C-54 Skymaster and its US Navy equivalent, the R5D, of which the US military had approximately 565, with 268 Air Force and Navy Skymasters in MATS, 168 in the troop carrier groups, and 80 Navy R5Ds in miscellaneous commands. Planners calculated that including C-54s already ordered to Germany and drawing on those flying with civilian carriers, 447 Skymasters could be available for an \\"extreme emergency\\". Given the feasibility assessment made by the British, an airlift appeared to be the best course of action. One remaining concern was the population of Berlin. Clay called in Ernst Reuter, the mayor-elect of Berlin, accompanied by his aide, Willy Brandt. Clay told Reuter: Reuter, although skeptical, assured Clay that Berlin would make all the necessary sacrifices and that the Berliners would support his actions. General Albert Wedemeyer, the US Army Chief of Plans and Operations, was in Europe on an inspection tour when the crisis broke out. He had been the commander of the US China Burma India Theater in 1944‚Äì45 and he had a detailed knowledge of the previously largest airlift‚Äîthe World War II American airlift from India over the Hump of the Himalayas to China. His endorsement of the airlift option gave it a major boost. The British and Americans agreed to start a joint operation without delay; the US action was dubbed \\"Operation Vittles\\",Miller acknowledges that most histories credit Smith with coining the term by dramatically stating: \\"Hell's Fire! We're hauling grub. Call it Operation Vittles!\\" However, he states that the origin is \\"probably more prosaic\\" and due to Col. William O. Large, Jr., a duty officer in the Operations Division of Headquarters USAF in the Pentagon. At the time a codename was needed to coordinate activities. Large suggested \\"Vittles\\" because of its probable unfamiliarity to the Soviets. (Miller 2000, p. 58) while the British action was called \\"Operation Plainfare\\".The original code name for the RAF operation was \\"Carter Paterson\\", a noted British hauling (US=\\"moving\\") firm. A caustic Soviet jest prompted the change to \\"Plainfare\\", a deliberate pun on \\"plane fare\\" (airplane/food), on 19 July. The Australian contribution to the airlift, begun in September 1948, was designated \\"Operation Pelican\\". The British asked Canada to contribute planes and crews. It refused, primarily on the grounds that the operation risked war and Canada had not been consulted.James Eayrs, In Defence of Canada: volume 4: Growing Up Allied (1980) pp. 39‚Äì51 Airlift begins Loading milk on a West Berlin- bound aircraft On 24 June 1948 LeMay appointed Brigadier General Joseph Smith, headquarters commandant for USAFE at Camp Lindsey, as the Provisional Task Force Commander of the airlift. Smith had been chief of staff in LeMay's B-29 command in India during World War II and had no airlift experience. On 25 June 1948 Clay gave the order to launch Operation Vittles. The next day 32 C-47s lifted off for Berlin hauling 80 tons of cargo, including milk, flour, and medicine. The first British aircraft flew on 28 June. At that time, the airlift was expected to last three weeks. On 27 June, Clay cabled William Draper with an estimate of the current situation: By 1 July, the system was getting under way. C-54s were starting to arrive in quantity, and Rhein-Main Air Base became exclusively a C-54 hub, while Wiesbaden retained a mix of C-54s and C-47s. Aircraft flew northeast through the American air corridor into Tempelhof Airport, then returned due west flying out on through the British air corridor. After reaching the British Zone, they turned south to return to their bases. Germans watching supply planes at Tempelhof 1950s film by the British Government about the Berlin airlift The British ran a similar system, flying southeast from several airports in the Hamburg area through their second corridor into RAF Gatow in the British Sector, and then also returning out on the center corridor, turning for home or landing at Hanover. However, unlike the Americans, the British also ran some round-trips, using their southeast corridor. To save time many flights didn't land in Berlin, instead air dropping material, such as coal, into the airfields. On 6 July the Yorks and Dakotas were joined by Short Sunderland flying boats. Flying from Finkenwerder on the Elbe near Hamburg to the Havel river next to Gatow, their corrosion-resistant hulls suited them to the particular task of delivering baking powder and other salt into the city. The Royal Australian Air Force also contributed to the British effort. Accommodating the large number of flights to Berlin of dissimilar aircraft with widely varying flight characteristics required close co-ordination. Smith and his staff developed a complex timetable for flights called the \\"block system\\": three eight-hour shifts of a C-54 section to Berlin followed by a C-47 section. Aircraft were scheduled to take off every four minutes, flying higher than the flight in front. This pattern began at and was repeated five times. This system of stacked inbound serials was later dubbed \\"the ladder\\".MAC and the Legacy of the Berlin Airlift During the first week the airlift averaged only ninety tons a day, but by the second week it reached 1,000 tons. This likely would have sufficed had the effort lasted only a few weeks, as originally believed. The Communist press in East Berlin ridiculed the project. It derisively referred to \\"the futile attempts of the Americans to save face and to maintain their untenable position in Berlin.\\"Fifty years ago, a massive airlift into Berlin showed the Soviets that a post-WW II blockade would not work, C.V. Glines Despite the excitement engendered by glamorous publicity extolling the work (and over-work) of the crews and the daily increase of tonnage levels, the airlift was not close to being operated to its capability because USAFE was a tactical organisation without any airlift expertise. Maintenance was barely adequate, crews were not being efficiently used, transports stood idle and disused, necessary record-keeping was scant, and ad hoc flight crews of publicity-seeking desk personnel were disrupting a business-like atmosphere. This was recognised by the United States National Security Council at a meeting with Clay on 22 July 1948, when it became clear that a long-term airlift was necessary. Wedemeyer immediately recommended that the deputy commander for operations of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), Maj. Gen. William H. Tunner, command the operation. When Wedemeyer had been the commander of US forces in China during World War II, Tunner, as commander of the India-China Division of the Air Transport Command, had reorganised the Hump airlift between India and China, doubling the tonnage and hours flown. USAF Chief of Staff Hoyt S. Vandenberg endorsed the recommendation. Black Friday On 28 July 1948, Tunner arrived in Wiesbaden to take over the operation. He revamped the entire airlift operation, reaching an agreement with LeMay to form the Combined Air Lift Task Force (CALTF) to control both the USAFE and RAF lift operations from a central location, which went into effect in mid-October 1948. MATS immediately deployed eight squadrons of C-54s‚Äî72 aircraft‚Äîto Wiesbaden and Rhein-Main Air Base to reinforce the 54 already in operation, the first by 30 July and the remainder by mid-August, and two-thirds of all C-54 aircrew worldwide began transferring to Germany to allot three crews per aircraft. C-74 Globemaster plane at Gatow airfield on 19 August with more than 20 tons of flour from the United States Two weeks after his arrival, on 13 August, Tunner decided to fly to Berlin to grant an award to Lt. Paul O. Lykins, an airlift pilot who had made the most flights into Berlin up to that time, a symbol of the entire effort to date. Cloud cover over Berlin dropped to the height of the buildings, and heavy rain showers made radar visibility poor. A C-54 crashed and burned at the end of the runway, and a second one landing behind it burst its tires while trying to avoid it. A third transport ground looped after mistakenly landing on a runway under construction. In accordance with the standard procedures then in effect, all incoming transports including Tunner's, arriving every three minutes, were stacked above Berlin by air traffic control from to in bad weather, creating an extreme risk of mid-air collision. Newly unloaded planes were denied permission to take off to avoid that possibility and created a backup on the ground. While no one was killed, Tunner was embarrassed that the control tower at Tempelhof had lost control of the situation while the commander of the airlift was circling overhead. Tunner radioed for all stacked aircraft except his to be sent home immediately. This became known as \\"Black Friday\\", and Tunner personally noted it was from that date that the success of the airlift stemmed. As a result of Black Friday, Tunner instituted a number of new rules; instrument flight rules (IFR) would be in effect at all times, regardless of actual visibility, and each sortie would have only one chance to land in Berlin, returning to its air base if it missed its approach, where it was slotted back into the flow. Stacking was completely eliminated. With straight- in approaches, the planners found that in the time it had taken to unstack and land nine aircraft, 30 aircraft could be landed, bringing in 300 tons. Accident rates and delays dropped immediately. Tunner decided, as he had done during the Hump operation, to replace the C-47s in the airlift with C-54s or larger aircraft when it was realised that it took just as long to unload a 3.5-ton C-47 as a 10-ton C-54. One of the reasons for this was the sloping cargo floor of the \\"taildragger\\" C-47s, which made truck loading difficult. The tricycle geared C-54's cargo deck was level, so that a truck could back up to it and offload cargo quickly. The change went into full effect after 28 September 1948. Having noticed on his first inspection trip to Berlin on 31 July that there were long delays as the flight crews returned to their aircraft after getting refreshments from the terminal, Tunner banned aircrew from leaving their aircraft for any reason while in Berlin. Instead, he equipped jeeps as mobile snack bars, handing out refreshments to the crews at their aircraft while it was being unloaded. Airlift pilot Gail Halvorsen later noted, \\"he put some beautiful German Fr√§uleins in that snack bar. They knew we couldn't date them, we had no time. So they were very friendly.\\" Operations officers handed pilots their clearance slips and other information while they ate. With unloading beginning as soon as engines were shut down on the ramp, turnaround before takeoff back to Rhein-Main or Wiesbaden was reduced to thirty minutes. An RAF Short Sunderland moored on the Havel near Berlin unloading salt during the airlift To maximise the utilisation of a limited number of aircraft, Tunner altered the \\"ladder\\" to three minutes and of separation, stacked from to . Maintenance, particularly adherence to 25-hour, 200-hour, and 1,000-hour inspections, became the highest priority and further maximised utilisation. Tunner also shortened block times to six hours to squeeze in another shift, making 1,440 (the number of minutes in a day) landings in Berlin a daily goal.It is interesting to contrast this with Military Airlift Command's hot-war requirements of only 1,600 sorties a day for all of Europe. See \\"The Cognitive Dynamics of Computer Science\\", John Wiley and Sons, 2006, p. 213 His purpose, illustrating his basic philosophy of the airlift business, was to create a \\"conveyor belt\\" approach to scheduling that could be sped up or slowed down as situations might dictate. The most effective measure taken by Tunner, and the most initially resisted until it demonstrated its efficiency, was creation of a single control point in the CALTF for controlling all air movements into Berlin, rather than each air force doing its own. The Berliners themselves solved the problem of the lack of manpower. Crews unloading and making airfield repairs at the Berlin airports were made up almost entirely of local civilians, who were given additional rations in return. As the crews increased in experience, the times for unloading continued to fall, with a record set for the unloading of an entire 10-ton shipment of coal from a C-54 in ten minutes, later beaten when a twelve-man crew unloaded the same quantity in five minutes and 45 seconds. By the end of August 1948, after two months, the Airlift was succeeding; daily operations flew more than 1,500 flights a day and delivered more than 4,500 tons of cargo, enough to keep West Berlin supplied. From January 1949 onwards, 225 C-54s (40% of USAF and USN Skymasters worldwide) were devoted to the lift.The figure of 225 Skymasters‚Äî201 from the Air Force and 24 from the Navy‚Äîrepresents only those in Germany at any one time. Another 75 were always in the maintenance pipeline (raised in April 1949 to 100), and 19 more were assigned to the airlift replacement training unit at Great Falls AFB, Montana. At its maximum, 312 of the 441 USAF C-54s were committed to the airlift. Supplies improved to 5,000 tons a day. \\"Operation Little Vittles\\" US Air Force pilot Gail Halvorsen, who pioneered the idea of dropping candy bars and bubble gum with handmade miniature parachutes, which later became known as \\"Operation Little Vittles\\" Gail Halvorsen, one of the many Airlift pilots, decided to use his off-time to fly into Berlin and make movies with his hand- held camera. He arrived at Tempelhof on 17 July 1948 on one of the C-54s and walked over to a crowd of children who had gathered at the end of the runway to watch the aircraft. He introduced himself and they started to ask him questions about the aircraft and their flights. As a goodwill gesture, he handed out his only two sticks of Wrigley's Doublemint Gum. The children quickly divided up the pieces as best they could, even passing around the wrapper for others to smell. He was so impressed by their gratitude and that they didn't fight over them, that he promised the next time he returned he would drop off more. Before he left them, a child asked him how they would know it was him flying over. He replied, \\"I'll wiggle my wings.\\" A Douglas C-54 Skymaster dropping candy over Berlin, c. 1948/49 The next day on his approach to Berlin, he rocked the aircraft and dropped some chocolate bars attached to a handkerchief parachute to the children waiting below. Every day after that, the number of children increased and he made several more drops. Soon, there was a stack of mail in Base Ops addressed to \\"Uncle Wiggly Wings\\", \\"The Chocolate Uncle\\" and \\"The Chocolate Flier\\". His commanding officer was upset when the story appeared in the news, but when Tunner heard about it, he approved of the gesture and immediately expanded it into \\"Operation Little Vittles\\". Other pilots participated, and when news reached the US, children all over the country sent in their own candy to help out. Soon, major candy manufacturers joined in. In the end, over three tons of candy were dropped on Berlin and the \\"operation\\" became a major propaganda success. German children christened the candy-dropping aircraft \\"raisin bombers\\".Smoler, Fredric (April/May 2003). \\"Where Berlin and America Meet \\" American Heritage. Retrieved 29 July 2010. Soviet responses The Soviets had an advantage in conventional military forces, but were preoccupied with rebuilding their war- torn economy and society. The US had a stronger navy and air force, and had nuclear weapons. Neither side wanted a war; the Soviets did not disrupt the airlift.Michael Laird, \\"Wars averted: Chanak 1922, Burma 1945‚Äì47, Berlin 1948.\\" Journal of Strategic Studies (1996) 19#3 pp. 343‚Äì64. Initial reaction As the tempo of the airlift grew, it became apparent that the Western powers might be able to pull off the impossible: indefinitely supplying an entire city by air alone. In response, starting on 1 August 1948, the Soviets offered free food to anyone who crossed into East Berlin and registered their ration cards there, and almost 22 thousands of Berliners received their cards until 4 August 1948.Wetzlaugk U. Berliner Blokade 1948/49. Berlin,1998. S.54 In 1949 more than 100 thousands West Berliners were receiving Soviet supplies in Eastern Berlin. On 20 August 1948 the British occupation forces blocked Potsdamer Platz with barbed wire to deny access of the citizens to the Soviet supplies. On 30 March 1949 the Americans organized a purge in the West Berlin police, firing all those who received food in the Soviet sector. Some West Berliners rejected Soviet offers of food. Throughout the airlift, Soviet and German communists subjected the hard-pressed West Berliners to sustained psychological warfare. In radio broadcasts, they relentlessly proclaimed that all Berlin came under Soviet authority and predicted the imminent abandonment of the city by the Western occupying powers. The Soviets also harassed members of the democratically elected citywide administration, which had to conduct its business in the city hall located in the Soviet sector. During the early months of the airlift, the Soviets used various methods to harass allied aircraft. These included buzzing by Soviet planes, obstructive parachute jumps within the corridors, and shining searchlights to dazzle pilots at night. Although the USAFE reported 733 separate harassing events, including flak, air-to-air fire, rocketing, bombing, and explosions, this is now considered to be exaggerated. None of these measures were effective. Former RAF Dakota pilot Dick Arscott described one \\"buzzing\\" incident. \\"Yaks (Soviet fighter aircraft) used to come and buzz you and go over the top of you at about twenty feet which can be off putting. One day I was buzzed about three times. The following day it started again and he came across twice and I got a bit fed up with it. So when he came for the third time, I turned the aircraft into him and it was a case of chicken, luckily he was the one who chickened out.\\"BBC Radio 4 programme \\"The Reunion, The Berlin Airlift,\\" first broadcast 22 August 2014 Attempted Communist putsch in the municipal government In the autumn of 1948 it became impossible for the non-Communist majority in Greater Berlin's citywide parliament to attend sessions at city hall within the Soviet sector. The parliament (Stadtverordnetenversammlung von Gro√ü-Berlin) had been elected under the provisional constitution of Berlin two years earlier (20 October 1946). As SED-controlled policemen looked on passively, Communist-led mobs repeatedly invaded the Neues Stadthaus, the provisional city hall (located on Parochialstra√üe since all other central municipal buildings had been destroyed in the War), interrupted the parliament's sessions, and physically menaced its non-Communist members. The Kremlin organised an attempted putsch for control of all of Berlin through a 6 September takeover of the city hall by SED members. Three days later RIAS Radio urged Berliners to protest against the actions of the communists. On 9 September 1948 a crowd of 500,000 people gathered at the Brandenburg Gate, next to the ruined Reichstag in the British sector. The airlift was working so far, but many West Berliners feared that the Allies would eventually discontinue it. Then-SPD city councillor Ernst Reuter took the microphone and pleaded for his city, \\"You peoples of the world, you people of America, of England, of France, look on this city, and recognise that this city, this people, must not be abandoned‚Äîcannot be abandoned!\\" The crowd surged towards the Soviet-occupied sector and someone climbed up and ripped down the Soviet flag flying from atop the Brandenburg Gate. Soviet military police (MPs) quickly responded, resulting in the killing of one in the unruly crowd. The tense situation could have escalated further and ended up in more bloodshed but a British deputy provost then intervened and pointedly pushed the Soviet MPs back with his swagger stick.MacDonogh, G \\"After the Reich\\" John Murray London 2007 p. 533 Never before this incident had so many Berliners gathered in unity. The resonance worldwide was enormous, notably in the United States, where a strong feeling of solidarity with Berliners reinforced a general widespread determination not to abandon them. Berlin's parliament decided to meet instead in the canteen of the Technical College of Berlin-Charlottenburg in the British sector, boycotted by the members of SED, which had gained 19.8% of the electoral votes in 1946. On 30 November 1948 the SED gathered its elected parliament members and 1,100 further activists and held an unconstitutional so-called \\"extraordinary city assembly\\" (au√üerordentliche Stadtverordnetenversammlung) in East Berlin's Metropol-Theater which declared the elected city government (Magistrat) and its democratically elected city councillors to be deposed and replaced it with a new one led by Oberb√ºrgermeister Friedrich Ebert Jr. and consisting only of Communists. This arbitrary act had no legal effect in West Berlin, but the Soviet occupants prevented the elected city government for all of Berlin from further acting in the eastern sector. December elections The city parliament, boycotted by its SED members, then voted for its re-election on 5 December 1948, however, inhibited in the eastern sector and defamed by the SED as a Spalterwahl (\\"divisive election\\"). The SED did not nominate any candidates for this election and appealed to the electorate in the western sectors to boycott the election, while the democratic parties ran for seats. The turnout amounted to 86.3% of the western electorate with the SPD gaining 64.5% of the votes (= 76 seats), the CDU 19.4% (= 26 seats), and the Liberal- Demokratische Partei (LDP, merged in the FDP in 1949) 16.1% (= 17 seats). On 7 December the new, de facto West-Berlin-only city parliament elected a new city government in West Berlin headed by Lord Mayor Reuter, who had already once been elected lord mayor in early 1946 but prevented from taking office by a Soviet veto. Thus two separate city governments officiated in the city divided into East and West versions of its former self. In the east, a communist system supervised by house, street, and block wardens was quickly implemented. West Berlin's parliament accounted for the de facto political partition of Berlin and replaced the provisional constitution of Berlin by the Verfassung von Berlin (constitution of Berlin), meant for all Berlin, with effect of 1 October 1950 and de facto restricted to the western sectors only, also renaming city parliament (from Stadtverordnetenversammlung von Gro√ü-Berlin to Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin), city government (from Magistrat von Gro√ü-Berlin to Senate of Berlin), and head of government (from Oberb√ºrgermeister to Governing Mayor of Berlin).Cf. articles 25 and 40 of Die Verfassung von Berlin (Constitution of Berlin [West]), Berlin (West): Landeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildungsarbeit Berlin, 1982, pp. 34, 37. Winter 1948 to spring 1949 Preparing for winter Although the early estimates were that about 4,000 to 5,000 tons per day would be needed to supply the city, this was made in the context of summer weather, when the Airlift was only expected to last a few weeks. As the operation dragged on into autumn, the situation changed considerably. The food requirements would remain the same (around 1,500 tons), but the need for additional coal to heat the city dramatically increased the total amount of cargo to be transported by an additional 6,000 tons a day. To maintain the Airlift under these conditions, the current system would have to be greatly expanded. Aircraft were available, and the British started adding their larger Handley Page Hastings in November, but maintaining the fleet proved to be a serious problem. Tunner looked to the Germans once again, hiring (plentiful) ex-Luftwaffe ground crews. C-54s stand out against the snow at Wiesbaden Air Base during the Berlin Airlift in the Winter of 1948‚Äì49 Another problem was the lack of runways in Berlin to land on: two at Tempelhof and one at Gatow‚Äîneither of which was designed to support the loads the C-54s were putting on them. All of the existing runways required hundreds of labourers, who ran onto them between landings and dumped sand into the runway's Marston Mat (pierced steel planking) to soften the surface and help the planking survive. Since this system could not endure through the winter, between July and September 1948 a 6,000 ft.-long asphalt runway was constructed at Tempelhof. Far from ideal, with the approach being over Berlin's apartment blocks, the runway nevertheless was a major upgrade to the airport's capabilities. With it in place, the auxiliary runway was upgraded from Marston Matting to asphalt between September and October 1948. A similar upgrade program was carried out by the British at Gatow during the same period, also adding a second runway, using concrete. The French Air Force, meanwhile, had become involved in the First Indochina War, so it could only bring up some old Junkers Ju 52s to support its own troops and they were too small and slow to be of much help. However, France agreed to build a complete, new and larger airport in its sector on the shores of Lake Tegel. French military engineers, managing German construction crews, were able to complete the construction in under 90 days. Because of a shortage of heavy equipment, the first runway was mostly built by hand, by thousands of labourers who worked day and night. Alt URL For the second runway at Tegel, heavy equipment was needed to level the ground, equipment that was too large and heavy to fly in on any existing cargo aircraft. The solution was to dismantle large machines and then re-assemble them. Using the five largest American C-82 Packet transports, it was possible to fly the machinery into West Berlin. This not only helped to build the airfield, but also demonstrated that the Soviet blockade could not keep anything out of Berlin. The Tegel airfield was subsequently developed into Berlin Tegel Airport. To improve air traffic control, which would be critical as the number of flights grew, the newly developed ground-controlled approach radar system (GCA) was flown to Europe for installation at Tempelhof, with a second set installed at Fassberg in the British Zone in West Germany. With the installation of GCA, all-weather airlift operations were assured. None of these efforts could fix the weather, which became the biggest problem. November and December 1948 proved to be the worst months of the airlift operation. One of the longest-lasting fogs ever experienced in Berlin blanketed the entire European continent for weeks. All too often, aircraft would make the entire flight and then be unable to land in Berlin. On 20 November 1948, 42 aircraft departed for Berlin, but only one landed there. At one point, the city had only a week's supply of coal left. However, the weather eventually improved, and more than 171,000 tons were delivered in January 1949, 152,000 tons in February, and 196,223 tons in March. Easter parade By April 1949, airlift operations were running smoothly and Tunner wanted to shake up his command to discourage complacency. He believed in the spirit of competition between units and, coupled with the idea of a big event, felt that this would encourage them to greater efforts. He decided that, on Easter Sunday, the airlift would break all records. To do this, maximum efficiency was needed and so, to simplify cargo-handling, only coal would be airlifted. Coal stockpiles were built up for the effort and maintenance schedules were altered so that the maximum number of aircraft were available. From noon on 15 April to noon on 16 April 1949, crews worked around the clock. When it was over, 12,941 tons of coal had been delivered in 1,383 flights, without a single accident. A welcome side effect of the effort was that operations in general were boosted, and tonnage increased from 6,729 tons to 8,893 tons per day thereafter. In total, the airlift delivered 234,476 tons in April. On 21 April, the tonnage of supplies flown into the city exceeded that previously brought by rail. End of the blockade RAF Celle and at Rhein-Main Air Base. Base of the Berlin Airlift Monument in Berlin-Tempelhof with inscription \\"They gave their lives for the freedom of Berlin in service of the Berlin Airlift 1948/49\\" On 15 April 1949, the Soviet news agency TASS reported a willingness by the Soviets to lift the blockade. The next day, the US State Department stated that the \\"way appears clear\\" for the blockade to end. Soon afterwards, the four powers began serious negotiations, and a settlement was reached on Western terms. On 4 May 1949, the Allies announced an agreement to end the blockade in eight days. The Soviet blockade of Berlin was lifted at one minute after midnight on 12 May 1949. A British convoy immediately drove through to Berlin, and the first train from West Germany reached Berlin at 5:32 A.M. Later that day, an enormous crowd celebrated the end of the blockade. General Clay, whose retirement had been announced by US President Truman on 3 May 1949, was saluted by 11,000 US soldiers and dozens of aircraft. Once home, Clay received a ticker tape parade in New York City, was invited to address the US Congress, and was honoured with a medal from President Truman. Nevertheless, supply flights to Berlin continued for some time to build up a comfortable surplus, though night flying and then weekend flights could be eliminated once the surplus was large enough. By 24 July 1949, three months' worth of supplies had been amassed, ensuring that there was ample time to restart the Airlift if needed. On 18 August 1949, Flt Lt Roy Mather DFC AFC and his crew of Flt Lt Roy Lewis Stewart Hathaway AFC, Flt Lt Richardson and Royston William Marshall AFM of 206 squadron, flew back to Wunstorf for the 404th time during the blockade, the record number of flights for any pilot of any nationality, either civilian or military. The Berlin Airlift officially ended on 30 September 1949, after fifteen months. In total, the USAF delivered 1,783,573 tons and the RAF 541,937 tons, totalling 2,326,406 tons, nearly two-thirds of which was coal, on 278,228 flights to Berlin. The Royal Australian Air Force delivered 7,968 tons of freight and 6,964 passengers during 2,062 sorties. The C-47s and C-54s together flew over in the process, almost the distance from Earth to the Sun. At the height of the Airlift, one plane reached West Berlin every thirty seconds. Pilots came from the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa.The Berlin Airlift ‚Äì Facts & Figures, National Cold War Exhibition. Retrieved 2 January 2013 A total of 101 fatalities were recorded as a result of the operation, including 40 Britons and 31 Americans, mostly due to non-flying accidents. One Royal Australian Air Force member was killed in an aircraft crash at L√ºbeck while attached to No. 27 Squadron RAF. Seventeen American and eight British aircraft crashed during the operation. The cost of the Airlift was shared between the US, UK, and Germany. Estimated costs range from approximately US$224 million to over US$500 million (equivalent to approximately $ to $ now). Subsequent events Operational control of the three Allied air corridors was assigned to BARTCC (Berlin Air Route Traffic Control Center) air traffic control located at Tempelhof. Diplomatic approval was granted by a four-power organisation called the Berlin Air Safety Center, also located in the American sector.  Berlin crises 1946‚Äì1962  After World War II, Germans tended to prefer living in West Germany over East Germany, and Berlin became a major escape route for people wanting to leave the Soviet sphere of influence for the West. This led to major-power conflict over Berlin that stretched at least from 1946 to the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961. After US President Truman was replaced by Eisenhower in 1953 and Khrushchev became Soviet head of state in 1958, Khrushchev tried to push Eisenhower on Berlin in 1958‚Äì59. The Soviets backed down when Eisenhower's resolve seemed to match that of Truman. When Eisenhower was replaced by Kennedy in 1961, Khrushchev tried again, with essentially the same result.  Other developments  In the late 1950s, the runways at West Berlin's city centre Tempelhof Airport had become too short to accommodate the new-generation jet aircraft,Berlin Airport Company ‚Äì Special Report on Air France's 25th Anniversary at Berlin Tegel, March 1985 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tegel Airport, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1985 and Tegel was developed into West Berlin's principal airport. During the 1970s and 1980s Sch√∂nefeld had its own crossing points through the Berlin Wall and communist fortifications for western citizens. The Soviets' contravention by the blockade of the agreement reached by the London 6-Power Conference, and the Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat of 1948, convinced Western leaders that they had to take swift and decisive measures to strengthen the portions of Germany not occupied by the Soviets. The US, British and French authorities also agreed to replace their military administrations in their occupation zones with High Commissioners operating within the terms of a three-power occupation statute. The Blockade also helped to unify German politicians in these zones in support of the creation of a West German state; some of them had hitherto been fearful of Soviet opposition. The blockade also increased the perception among many Europeans that the Soviets posed a danger, helping to prompt the entry into NATO of Portugal, Iceland, Italy, Denmark, and Norway. Animosities between Germans and the Western Allies ‚Äì Britain, France and the United States ‚Äì were greatly reduced by the airlift, with the former enemies recognising common interests, namely freedom and capitalism, shared values and mutual respect. The Soviets refused to return to the Allied Control Council in Berlin, rendering the four-power occupation authority set up at the Potsdam Conference useless. It has been argued that the events of the Berlin Blockade are proof that the Allies conducted their affairs within a rational framework, since they were keen to avoid war.  Post-Cold War  In 2007, Tegel was joined by a re-developed Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld International Airport in Brandenburg. As a result of the development of these two airports, Tempelhof was closed in October 2008, while Gatow became home of the Bundeswehr Museum of Military History ‚Äì Berlin-Gatow Airfield and a housing development.

Many aircraft were either former bombers or civil versions of bombers. In the absence of enough transports, the British chartered many civilian aircraft. British European Airways (BEA) coordinated all British civil aircraft operations. Apart from BEA itself, the participating airlines included British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and most British independentindependent from government-owned corporations airlines of that era‚Äîe.g. Eagle Aviation, Silver City Airways, British South American Airways (BSAA), the Lancashire Aircraft Corporation, Airwork, Air Flight, Aquila Airways, Flight Refuelling Ltd (which used their Lancaster tankers to deliver aviation fuel), Skyways, Scottish Airlines and Ciro's Aviation. Altogether, BEA was responsible to the RAF for the direction and operation of 25 British airlines taking part in \\"Operation Plainfare\\". The British also used flying boats, particularly for transporting corrosive salt. These included civilian aircraft operated by Aquila Airways. These took off and landed on water and were designed to be corrosion-resistant. In winter, when ice covered the Berlin rivers and made the use of flying boats difficult, the British used other aircraft in their place. Altogether, a total of 692 aircraft were engaged in the Berlin Airlift, more than 100 of which belonged to civilian operators. Other aircraft included Junkers Ju 52/3m which were operated briefly by France.

History Various fee-for- carriage proposals have been put before the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) a number of times over the years, and rejected each time until 2009. In the past, broadcasters sought to receive a fixed per-subscriber fee to be set by the CRTC; in 2007, broadcasters suggested a rate between 10 cents and $1.00 per subscriber each month. In some major markets there are nearly a dozen local over-the-air stations, which theoretically could have meant a monthly per-subscriber charge of $10 or more, assuming the CRTC had accepted the high end of the suggested range. In July 2009, the CRTC indicated it was \\"now of the view that a negotiated solution for compensation for the free market value of local conventional television signals is also appropriate\\", and would begin setting a process to determine appropriate value for signal at hearings in the fall. However, following a court challenge by Bell Canada arguing it had endorsed fee-for-carriage without giving carriers a chance to provide input, the CRTC said it would look at the concept de novo at those same hearings. At the same time as the original announcement, as an interim measure, the commission also announced a temporary one-year increase, from 1% to 1.5%, of the fee levied on cable and satellite companies to fund the Local Programming Improvement Fund (LPIF), which supports local programming at stations in smaller markets. The LPIF has been in place since 2008 and is a separate matter from the various signal compensation proposals; however, many cable companies used the increase as an opportunity to introduce the fee as a separate line item on customers' bills.Rogers, Bell TV customers warned of fee hikes, CBC.ca, 2009-08-10 The CRTC later announced that it had received an order-in-council from the Harper cabinet requesting a separate set of hearings in early December 2009 to specifically consider the views of consumers on the matter, and will submit a report containing recommendations to cabinet shortly thereafter. This means that cabinet will ultimately decide whether or not to allow such fees.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2009-614, 2009-10-02, accessed 2009-12-11 It has been argued that the acquisitions of Global from Canwest by Shaw Communications in 2010 and CTV from CTVglobemedia by Bell Canada Enterprises in 2011 rendered the issue moot. In 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada decided that this issue falls outside of the scope of the CRTC. Positions of major media companies Local TV Matters coalition The Local TV Matters coalition consists of the CBC (owner of the CBC Television and Radio-Canada networks), CTVglobemedia (owner of CTV and A), Canwest (owner of Global), Remstar (owner of V), and the independently-owned CHEK and NTV. Citytv, which was already owned by cable provider Rogers Communications, was the only major television group not to participate in the campaign. The campaign, which started in mid-2009, was an outgrowth of CTVglobemedia's \\"Save Local TV\\" campaign which started earlier that year. The private broadcasters within this coalition supported a mechanism under which each station would receive the option of either: * mandatory carriage on all cable systems in their service area without compensation, as is presently mandated for all over-the-air stations, or * no mandatory carriage rights, but the right to negotiate with service providers for compensation. In the latter case, stations would be able to withhold their signals, and potentially force blackouts of U.S. stations during programs that would otherwise be simultaneously substituted, from a particular service provider in the absence of a compensation deal. Service providers would likewise not be required to carry stations that had sought, but failed to reach, a compensation agreement with that provider. This system would be similar to the American FCC system of retransmission consent. The CBC supported the right to negotiate for compensation, but was not willing to waive its mandatory carriage rights due to its status as a public broadcaster. Instead, it would ask for binding arbitration in the event negotiations with service providers failed. The CBC's proposal instead focused primarily on requiring providers to offer a \\"skinny basic\\" package containing a small number of basic services, including local stations.CBC comments in response to Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2009-614 , 2009-11-02 Arguments The broadcasters argued that: * Such a rule is necessary in order for broadcast stations to gain parity with specialty channels, which receive revenues from both a share of cable/satellite subscription fees and advertising. * Customers are already paying for the ability to receive local stations through cable or satellite, and in many cases believe that some of their fee goes to directly fund local stations, when in fact they receive nothing (although providers do pay into funds that indirectly help broadcast stations, such as the aforementioned LPIF and the Canadian Television Fund). * Cable and satellite companies make enough profit to cover these increased costs without passing them on to their customers; broadcasters have suggested the CRTC reverse its decision to deregulate basic service rates in the early 2000s, in order to ensure customers aren't forced to pay more. * The model for conventional television - i.e. generating revenues purely through advertising - has been \\"broken\\" for several years, with many smaller stations operating at a loss since the 1990s, and the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 has merely exacerbated this existing problem. * Rejecting the proposal could mean the closure of more stations, particularly in small markets. Canwest closed CHCA-TV in August 2009, while CTV closed CKX-TV that October after a deal to sell the station for one dollar fell through; CTV simultaneously announced plans to shut down nearly all of its rebroadcast transmitters in smaller communities. CTV further indicated it may close more stations in the near future if it is unable to receive compensation from service providers. CHCH-DT went bankrupt in December 2015 (it remains on the air in a much lower-budget form). Stop the TV Tax coalition / Shaw Shaw Communications was an early and vocal opponent of fee-for-carriage. Shaw's efforts were later joined by a \\"Stop the TV Tax\\" coalition consisting of Rogers Communications (which owns both Rogers Cable and the conventional Citytv and Omni systems), Bell Canada, Bell Aliant, Cogeco, EastLink, and Telus; Shaw's campaign remains separate of this coalition for reasons that are unclear. Arguments Service providers argue: * Fee-for-carriage would be a tax on their subscription fees, forcing subscribers to pay a monthly charge for stations that would continue to be freely available via the public airwaves, i.e. antenna reception. (Broadcasters dispute the characterization as a \\"tax\\" on the grounds that it would not be set or collected by, or for, any government; service providers note that the decision on whether to allow the fees would be made by either the federal government itself or by the CRTC, a federal agency.) * There is no guarantee that these funds would improve local programming or prevent station closures. * The implementation of this policy would lead directly to increased basic cable rates for consumers, with most providers promising to list any broadcast-station carriage fees as a separate line item. Some providers suggest that fee increases of up to $10 per month remain a possibility (the broadcasters simply say that such fees would be subject to negotiation, but insist that they do not want consumers to pay more). * Such fees would be little more than a bailout for these broadcasters' allegedly poor financial management, i.e. buying expensive American programming or purchasing other media outlets, as opposed to producing more distinctive local or Canadian programming (the broadcasters have not directly responded to these claims, but historically, buying American programming has in fact been less expensive than producing Canadian programming). * CTV's and Canwest's costs of running local stations can be offset by their more profitable specialty channel assets (broadcasters respond that specialty channels often have multiple partners and hence cannot be easily used to subsidize other properties). * The fact that broadcast stations are carried by cable and satellite providers at all, not to mention simultaneous substitution privileges over U.S. stations, already provide a significant benefit to broadcasters (broadcasters argue that Canada is the only major English-speaking country to allow such wide distribution of the \\"big four\\" U.S. networks and hence that simsubs are necessary to protect their own broadcast rights). Quebecor Quebecor Media, owner of French- language network TVA as well as Quebec's largest cable company Videotron, also supports the principle of signal compensation but believes these funds should instead be deducted from the existing fees for specialty channels, rather than being either passed on to consumers or absorbed by service providers. Other independent small-market broadcasters Other companies that own small-market TV stations affiliated with other networks, such as Jim Pattison Group, Newcap, and Corus Entertainment (an affiliate of Shaw), do not explicitly support or oppose signal compensation, saying that this would have limited impact on their revenues given the small markets in which they operate. Their primary concern is instead maintaining carriage on satellite providers, which have now overtaken cable in many rural markets.

He was one of the most prominent Jewish activists in Vilnius (Vilna, Wilno). Educated as a doctor in Russia and Western Europe, he established his gynecology and pediatric practice in 1884. In 1905, he was one of the founding members of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in Vilnius Region. In 1918, he was co-opted to the Council of Lithuania and briefly served as the first Lithuanian Minister for Jewish Affairs. After Vilnius was captured by Poland, Wygodzki was elected to the Polish parliament (Sejm) in 1922 and 1928. He died in the Luki≈°kƒós Prison during the first months of the German occupation of Lithuania during World War II. Biography Wygodzki was born to a family of Hasidic Jews. His family moved to Vilnius (Vilna, Wilno) in 1860 where his father was a merchant, supplying the local garrison of the Imperial Russian Army with clothes. He was the eldest of seven brothers and received traditional Jewish education at a cheder. He studied at Marijampolƒó Gymnasium and Imperial Military Medical Academy in Saint Petersburg. He was arrested for anti-Tsarist activities and involvement with a revolutionary group. Later he studied medicine in Vienna, Berlin, Paris. In 1884, he returned to Vilnius and established his practice as gynecologist and pediatrician. He published medical articles in Russian and German journals. He joined Jewish cultural and political life. He was one of the first Zionist activist in Vilnius and chaired their organization. In 1905, during the Russian Revolution, he was one of the founding members of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in Vilnius Region. In 1908, he established and chaired the Union of Jewish Doctors. During World War I, he was a member of a Jewish relief committee and established daily Yiddish newspaper Flugblat. For anti-German protests, he was arrested by the German police in March 1917 and imprisoned in the Czersk POW camp until April 1918. He supported Lithuanian independence, and together with Nachmanas Rachmileviƒçius and Simon Yakovlevich Rosenbaum was co-opted to the Council of Lithuania on December 11, 1918. The same day he became the first Lithuanian Minister for Jewish Affairs. He held the post briefly as he did not evacuate from Vilnius with the rest of the government at the start of the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War. He was briefly imprisoned by the Bolsheviks. In 1919, when Poland captured Vilnius, Wygodzki was chairman of the Jewish community in the city. He opposed the ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny and the Republic of Central Lithuania and urged people to boycott the elections in 1922. Nevertheless, he accepted the situation and became a member of the Bloc of National Minorities and was elected to the Polish parliament (Sejm) in 1922 and 1928. In the Sejm, Wygodzki worked to improve Jewish education in Hebrew and Yiddish languages. He was also a member of the Vilnius Council from 1919 to 1929. Wygodzki contributed to the press, publishing his articles in Tsayt, Vilner Tog, Haynt, Nasz PrzeglƒÖd, and others. He published three books of his memoirs: In shturm (In the Storm; 1921) on the German occupation during World War I; In gehenom (In Hell; 1927) on his imprisonment by the Germans; and In Sambatyon (1931) on his activities in the Sejm. After the invasion of Poland in September 1940, Wygodzki organized relief for the Jewish refugees. In June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union and occupied the city. Wygodzki joined the pre-ghetto Judenrat on July 24. He was arrested at the end of August and died in the Luki≈°kƒós Prison.

Leme and Copacabana beaches. The Morro da Babil√¥nia (, Babylon Hill) is a hill in the Leme neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro, separating Copacabana beach from Botafogo. It is home to a favela known by the same name, as well as the favela Chap√©u Mangueira. Morro da Babil√¥nia is an environmentally protected area.  History  In the 18th century the Portuguese constructed a fortress on the top of the hill to protect the entrance to Guanabara Bay. Na trilha das lendas , Cristina Romanelli, Revista de Hist√≥ria, October 26, 2010 In the beginning of the 20th century, the engineer Augusto Ferreira Ramos, projected a connection of Babil√¥nia hill with Urca Hill, as part of the festivities of Centenary of Ports Opening. As diferentes faces do ‚Äòlouco‚Äô que criou o bondinho do P√£o de A√ß√∫car, O Globo, October 20, 2012 This project never went from paper to reality. In 1930, the hill was mentioned in one of poems in the Libertinagem collection by Manuel Bandeira. A poesia do jornalismo e o jornalismo na poesia: o tema em Manuel Bandeira, Ed√¥nio Alves do Nascimento, Tematica, August 20, 2005 The Morro da Babil√¥nia favela was founded at the end of the 19th century, when the army set up an observation post on the hill in Leme. Ordinary soldiers built the first shacks to stay on the hill. Later they were joined by construction workers that built the tunnels between the old city centre and Copacabana and Leme, as well as the tramway in the two neighbourhoods, as part of the once extensive Rio de Janeiro tramway system. The occupation of the favela really took off in the 1930s when construction workers building apartment complexes in the neighbourhood settled in the area. Democracia nas favelas , O Globo multimedia special There are two versions about the origin of the name of the favela. One is that the area evoked images of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, with the soldiers who first settled there. The other explanation is that at the nearby tramway station (which has disappeared) the brewery Brahma had a bar that sold a beer with the name Babil√¥nia. O Morro da Babil√¥nia se chama assim por causa da Brahma, O Globo, November 23, 2007 In the 2nd World War (1939 - 1945) the Brazilian Army constructed casemates on the top of the hill to protect the city against eventual attacks. According to a census in 2000 1,426 people lived in the favela which counted 380 houses and shacks. However, according to the dwellers association of Babil√¥nia there are 3,000 inhabitants and 800 dwellings. There are 18 streets that have been assigned names. Babil√¥nia has been controlled for years by drug traffickers linked to the Terceiro Comando (Third Command) organization, which imposed its rules by force on the community. In addition to controlling the illegal drug trade, the gunmen monopolized other services like the supply of cooking-gas cylinders and imposed rules on the population such as the times when they could come and go and the law of silence. In June 2009, police occupied the area without firing a shot. The intention is to make Babilonia into a model community by installing Police Pacification Units.Without Firing a Shot, Cops Chase Drug Dealers from Rio Slum, Latin American Herald Tribune, July 10, 2009  Pacification  The neighbourhood of Copacabana and Leme (in 2016), with temporary Stadium for beach volleyball After UPP arrival in 2009 the neighbourhood started to become more and more popular among tourists, which started a process of gentrification.Once Unsafe, Rio's Shantytowns See Rapid Gentrification, NPR, June 6, 2013 From the top, from the stone, there is a beautiful view and enough space to sit and watch the view of the Flamengo, on the one hand, the Red Beach and an unusual angle of Sugarloaf on the other. One of the effects that the pacification of favelas had, besides the general improvement of safety in the city, was that the hills became the destination of hikes. Babilonia became one of the so-called Disneyland favelas which were visited by dignitaries and the media to show the improved conditions after the installation of the UPP.As Olympics Near, Violence Grips Rio's 'Pacified' Favelas NPR, May 31, 2016 However, conditions worsened over the years and in April 2016 a rival gang from the neighboring favela tried to take control from the group that controls the drugs in Babil√¥nia.  Mural Babil√¥nia  Fragment of main mosaic of Mural Babil√¥nia. Mural Babil√¥nia started to be created in January 2014. The first urban intervention, the main mosaic, covers approximately 140 square meters of a retention wall constructed by the city. It is located at the bottom of Babil√¥nia favela. It was designed and created by plastic artists from Czech Republic, X-Dog and Plebe, with the help of dozens of voluntaries from all around the world. The second intervention brought to life a concrete bench with mosaic finishes. It was created on a spot that serves as a natural meeting point. Over time other mosaics appeared in the area, improving the visual and confirming Mural Babil√¥nia as a tourist reference point in Zona Sul of Rio de Janeiro. Among them, the lamp posts \\"Dark girl\\" and \\"The Flag\\" stand out, together with an educational slogan \\"Education is what you do when no one looks.\\" A stairway, very basic, was completely reconstructed and it also received a mosaic finish.

At first they had no aircraft, and for over a year had to operate using only classroom instruction.Melton 1970, p. The first aircraft assigned to the Detroit Naval Air Reserves was a single Consolidated NY-1, and would remain their sole aircraft for another year.Melton 1970, p. The base at Grosse Ile began with a single tin hangar floated down the Detroit River from the unit's former home near downtown Detroit.Melton 1970, p. By 1927 a large hangar had been built on Olds Bay at the southern tip of the island for use by Navy seaplanes.Melton 1970, p. By 1935 the Navy had acquired all the property formerly owned by The Detroit Aircraft Corporation and a Curtiss-Wright flying school, and had occupied the former Curtiss-Wright hangar, which became the base's primary hangar.Melton 1970, p. The airship ZMC-2, the Navy's only all- metal airship, was constructed on the site from 1925 to 1929 by the Detroit Aircraft Corporation.Morrow and Fritsche 1967, p.Outlaw 2004, p. The hangar where the airship was constructed measured 120' high, 120' wide and 180' long,Outlaw 2004, p.7 and remained the largest structure on the base until it was disassembled in 1960,Outlaw 2004, p.7 and its roof reused in the construction of a bowling alley in nearby Trenton, Michigan.Melton 1970, p. 1930s During the depression money was hard to come by, but NRAB Grosse Ile, MI continued to grow, many of its reservist drilling without pay.Outlaw 2004, p.7 By the end of 1930 the first Marine unit had been commissioned and based at Grosse Ile.Melton 1970, p. World War II World War II would come only 30 years after the Navy had acquired its first aircraft and 14 years after naval aviation had come to Grosse Ile, it would face a war that would change the world and base forever. During the war over 5,000 pilots received training at Grosse Ile, mostly Navy cadets, along with over a thousand British RAF pilot trainees.Outlaw 2004, p. With this rapid expansion the base gained the new designation of Naval Air Station.Outlaw 2004, p. The primary aircraft stationed at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile during the war years were Consolidated PBY Catalina, Vought F4U Corsairs, Curtiss SB2C Helldivers, and Grumman TBM Avengers.Melton 1970, p. Training was conducted using SNJ, and Boeing Stearman.Melton 1970, p. Immediately following the end of WWII the base was equipped with several squadrons of the huge Martin AM Maulers, and for a short time six McDonnell FH-1 Phantoms, the only jets ever based on the island.Melton 1970, p. Postwar After the war the base's runways were too short for use by the new generation of Navy jet fighters, and efforts to expand their lengths were met with disapproval by township citizens, so in the 1950s the base would see use as an ASW training base, which would continue until the base closed.Melton 1970, p.Outlaw 2004, p. During this time the base was principally supplied with A-1 Skyraiders, S2F anti-submarine warfare aircraft, as well as Marine Corps Reserve R4Q and R5D cargo aircraft.Melton 1970, p.Outlaw 2004, p. In 1956 the Army came to NASGI. A Nike site designated D-51 was built on the base, armed with three Nike Ajax SAM's to defend Detroit against Soviet strategic bombers. The Nike site was operated by U.S. Army personnel who were housed and fed alongside the Navy crews.Outlaw 2004, p. The Nike site closed in 1963, and was never upgraded to the nuclear-armed Nike Hercules. The Nike missile site is now a conservation area and bird sanctuary controlled by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Services. The base would also receive a small number of helicopters in the late 1950s, beginning with the Piasecki H-25, also known as the HUP-1. Later the crews converted to the larger HSS-1 Seabat. With no Coast Guard station nearby, the helicopters were a highly useful addition to NASGI, and were soon earning their keep performing rescue operations for stranded boaters on Lake Erie and along the Detroit River. On one occasion the base's HUP-1's retrieved 17 fishermen stranded on an ice flow during a snowstorm.Melton 1970, p. 1960s The air station entered the 1960s on a installation training over 2,000 Naval and Marine Reservists. For the Navy, the principal aircraft remained the A-1 Skyraider and S-2 Tracker, while the Marines converted to the OV-10 Bronco.Melton 1970, p.Outlaw 2004, p. Many of the men stationed at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile would serve in Vietnam. On 1 October 1960, future Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who was a Naval Aviator and a Lieutenant in the Naval Reserve, was designated as an aircraft commander with Air Antisubmarine Squadron 731 (VS-731), where he flew the S2F Tracker.http://www.airforcetimes.com/legacy/new/0-AIRPAPER-1610997.php The base closed in the fall of 1969, with its function and squadrons being moved to the newly established Naval Air Facility Detroit, located north of the city of Detroit as a tenant organization at what was then Selfridge Air Force Base, now Selfridge Air National Guard Base.Melton 1970, p.Outlaw 2004, p. Grosse Ile Township Airport Immediately following its closing the base was transformed into the Grosse Ile Municipal Airport.Melton 1970, p.Outlaw 2004, p. There are still some signs of the old naval air station, with the former Hangar 1 now serving as the Township Hall and offices. A museum is located in the township offices and a memorial garden dedicated to the old base and the men and women that served there is located on the old flight line ramp adjacent to Hangar 1. The original Curtiss-Wright flying school hangar still remains and is used to house civilian aircraft and a dance studio. Even the original tin hangar floated down the Detroit River in 1927 still stands, though it's on land controlled by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and not accessible to the public. As of 2011, the airport was averaging 24,000 takeoffs and landings a year.

Omnibus issues have often been made by countries under common political control or groups of colonies due to the close co-operation required to produce the issue. Omnibus issues are to be distinguished from joint issues which are usually much smaller in scope.  The first omnibus issue  The first omnibus has been said to be the issue of 1898 by the Portuguese colonial empire to commemorate the quatercentenary of Vasco de Gama's discovery of the sea route to India.Mackay, James.

File:Portuguese Timor stamp ¬Ω avo 1898 issue.jpg|Portuguese Timor File:1898 Macau stamp used Hong Kong.jpg|Portuguese Macau  British Empire and British Overseas Territories issues  Omnibuses have been particularly associated with stamps from the former British Empire, now the British Commonwealth, due to the large number of territories participating. Initially designs were identical for each colony with only the values, colours and colony names varying. Over time, however, a wider range of designs has been used within the same issue. The first issue was the Silver Jubilee issue of 1935.Sutton, R.J. & K.W. Anthony. The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia. 6th edition. London: Stanley Paul, 1966, p.216. Many others have followed, usually on themes related to the British Royal Family, but also for subjects such as Freedom from Hunger (1963) and the 1966 Football World Cup. Not every colony necessarily participates in every issue, although the revenue produced by the stamps is a valuable source of income for many smaller colonies/countries which may have few other ways of raising funds.

These issues have, however, been criticised for not being relevant to the culture of the participating countries, for instance stamps featuring Disney characters issued by poor African countries.  Commercialisation  While most earlier omnibus issues were genuine attempts to help a group of countries celebrate an anniversary or event, the fact that these became popular with stamp collectors tempted issuing authorities to bring out more stamps than would have otherwise been thought necessary. These were often heavily marketed.

It is written by the pseudonymous Allahpundit, Ed Morrissey, John Sexton, and Jazz Shaw. Hot Air was founded by Michelle Malkin, a conservative author and blogger, in 2006, taking over hotair.com from a defunct personal website. Although Malkin served as the publisher and CEO of Hot Air, she exercised little editorial control over the site's various commentators. Morrissey, a Roman Catholic, is the more socially conservative (though gay-friendly) of the two current bloggers, whereas Allahpundit is more libertarian and an atheist. Hot Air carried posts from a selection of conservative and libertarian bloggers in its \\"Green Room,\\" which closed in May 2014. In February 2010, Salem Communications purchased Hot Air. History Malkin launched Hot Air on April 24, 2006. The site's original logo showed an angry man videotaping himself while yelling at the lens. At the time of its founding, the site was to primarily feature \\"video- blogging\\" by Malkin, but this was eventually phased out in favor the more traditional written blog format due to lengthy production requirements for \\"video-blogging.\\" When founding Hot Air, Malkin stated an intention to provide \\"content and analysis you can't get anywhere else on a daily basis‚Äìboth on the blog and in our original video features.\\" In 2008, Malkin recruited Ed Morrissey as AllahP's co-blogger. At that time Morrissey was a full-time, profit-making blogger at Captain's Quarters, which he folded in order to join the Hot Air team (though its archives are still available). Morrissey maintains the podcast that started at his original website (\\"The Ed Morrissey Show\\"). This is promoted at and embedded on the Hot Air website. In 2008, Hot Air added a separate site-within-the site called \\"The Green Room,\\" inviting select professional and free-lance bloggers to contribute their posts. The Green Room provided bloggers with an opportunity to have their work distributed to the Hot Air audience. Green Room posts were often \\"promoted\\" to Hot Air's main page, in a fashion similar to that of other major political news/commentary sites such as the Daily Kos and RedState. The Green Room was closed in March 2014. Full-time bloggers Allahpundit Allahpundit's first site, Allah Is in the House was founded on August 27, 2003. The author wrote in the persona of Allah, using similar language to that of terrorist organizations but assuming the viewpoint of the God such organizations follow. (The author distinguished between the viewpoint being satirized and that of mainstream Muslims, and provided a disclaimer to the effect that his moniker was not, in fact, \\"anti-Muslim,\\" as casual visitors sometimes assumed.) The blog specialized in written and Photoshop-based political satire. After a hiatus in May 2004, the blog reemerged, continuing its satiric nature while largely abandoning the \\"Allah voice.\\" After October 2004 the blog was updated more sporadically, and the web address allahpundit.com was eventually abandoned. After occasional entries at allahakbar.blogspot.com, Allahpundit shut down his individual blogging operations altogether. In September 2004, Allahpundit was a key player in debunking the Killian documents hoax. Mary Mapes, producer of 60 Minutes, blamed Allahpundit and others for \\"working anonymously in what appeared to be huge numbers, in unison, to destroy the Bush-Guard story.\\"Mary Mapes, Truth and Duty, p. 201. Largely due to this controversy, the website was among the Top Blogs Cited in Political Postings for the 2004 United States presidential election.Blogpulse Campaign Radar 2004. The text of posts from Allahpundit's old Allah Is in the House blog are archived at the Internet Archive, although the image files that include AllahP's Photoshopped pictures are not.Archives of Allah Is in the House. AllahPundit has stated that he is unlikely to do PhotoShops in the future, due to his grueling writing/posting schedule. Ed Morrissey Morrissey's previous blog, \\"Captain's Quarters\\", was very popular among conservatives. He may be best known for helping expose the Canadian \\"Adscam\\" scandal in 2005. When Canadians were barred from reporting on the Gomery commission's hearings, Morrissey published detailed reports on his blog, which became a key source of information about \\"Adscam\\" for Canadians. This episode imparted some bipartisan \\"street cred\\" to Morrissey within the libertarian community in the U.S. and in Canada, and elevated his profile. Viewpoints Allahpundit's prominence on Hot Air is a contentious issue for some of the site's most conservative readers. He is often criticized for his comments and posts promoting atheism, such as once telling a critical commenter \\"Your children will be atheists\\", as well as for his frequent criticisms of former Governor Sarah Palin and some \\"hard-right\\" figures. Allahpundit is also known for his frequent posts on pop culture, including various viral videos and internet memes, and his self-deprecating humor (he often refers to himself, for example, as a \\"beta male\\"). The Daily Show host Jon Stewart cited Allahpundit as one of several bloggers he reads for his show-prep. The fact that Allahpundit's appearance and geographical location is unknown to the public is often used as an in-joke, with website commentators offering deliberately farcical and imaginative explanations. During the Michelle Malkin era, Malkin received significant pushback for keeping \\"Allahpundit\\" on her payroll, particularly from the more socially conservative readers at Hot Air. Michelle Malkin posted infrequently on Hot Air during the time she owned the site, but she was occasionally referenced there as \\"the Boss\\" (now \\"Boss Emeritus\\"). Both Allahpundit and Morrissey publicly disagreed with Malkin's take on the affairs of the day in Hot Air posts, and each has political positions that are significantly different from hers. The team also appears to be fairly independent of the socially conservative Salem Communications, as a spate of gay-friendly posts ‚Äî and endorsement by Morrissey of the group GOProud ‚Äî seems to attest. Editorial cartoonist Sarjex of the GayPatriot blog has satirized the controversy by drawing a LGBT version of HotAir, using bright pink colors and cheesecake images of Florida Senator Marco Rubio.

The public option is not the same as publicly funded health care, but was proposed as an alternative health insurance plan offered by the government. The public option was initially proposed for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but was removed after Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) threatened a filibuster.Lieberman: I'll block vote on Reid plan, By Manu Raju, Politico.com, 10/27/09 Subsequently, the Obama White House did not include the public option into the bill passed under reconciliation. The public option would later be supported by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party during the 2016 election, and by multiple Democratic candidates during the 2020 election, including the eventual Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. History Debate in 2009‚Äì10 The public option was featured in three bills considered by the United States House of Representatives in 2009: the proposed Affordable Health Care for America Act (), which was passed by the House in 2009, its predecessor, the proposed America's Affordable Health Choices Act (), and a third bill, the Public Option Act, also referred to as the \\"Medicare You Can Buy Into Act\\", (). In the first two bills, the public option took the form of a Qualified Health Benefit Plan competing with similar private insurance plans in an internet- based exchange or marketplace, enabling citizens and small businesses to purchase health insurance meeting a minimum federal standard. The Public Option Act, in contrast, would have allowed all citizens and permanent residents to buy into a public option by participating in the public Medicare program. Individuals covered by other employer plans or by state insurance plans such as Medicare would not have been eligible to obtain coverage from the exchange. The federal government's health insurance plan would have been financed entirely by premiums without subsidy from the Federal government,Why We Need a Public Health-Care Plan Robert Reich The Wall Street Journal although some plans called for government seed money to get the programs started.e.g. House Bill H.R.3962 Section 322 (b)2(B) \\"AMORTIZATION OF START-UP FUNDING- The Secretary shall provide for the repayment of the startup funding provided under subparagraph (A) to the Treasury in an amortized manner over the 10-year period beginning with Y1\\". The Senate HLP Committee bill contains a similar clause in ¬ß 3106 \\"A Health Benefit Plan Start-up Fund will be created to provide loans for initial operations, which the plan will be required to pay back no later than 10 years after the payment is made.\\" President Barack Obama promoted the idea of the public option while running for election in 2008. Following his election, Obama downplayed the need for a public health insurance option, including calling it a \\"sliver\\" of health care reform, but still campaigned for the option up until the health care reform was passed.Obama, Congress easing debate on public option - Beaver County Times Ultimately, the public option was removed from the final bill. While the United States House of Representatives passed a public option in their version of the bill, the public option was voted down in the Senate Finance CommitteeCNN: Senate panel votes down public option for health care bill. September 29, 2009. and the public option was never included in the final Senate bill, instead opting for state-directed health insurance exchanges.Bankrate: Key details of health reform bills. Critics of the removal of the public option accused President Obama of making an agreement to drop the public option from the final plan,David D. Kirkpatrick, August 12, 2009, \\"Obama is taking an active role in talks on health care plan\\", New York Times but the record showed that the agreement was based on vote counts rather than backroom deals, as substantiated by the final vote in the Senate.Washington Post: \\"Obama never secretly killed the public option. It‚Äôs a myth\\". November 17, 2011. Debate from 2011-2016 In January 2013, Representative Jan Schakowsky and 44 other U.S. House of Representatives Democrats introduced , the \\"Public Option Deficit Reduction Act\\", which would amend the Affordable Care Act to create a public option. The bill would set up a government-run health insurance plan with premiums 5% to 7% percent lower than private insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it would reduce the United States public debt by $104 billion over 10 years.\\"House Dems push again for creation of government-run health insurance option\\" The Hill, January 16, 2013 Representative Schakowsky reintroduced the bill as in January 2015, where it gained 35 cosponsors.\\"Cosponsors: H.R.265 ‚Äî 114th Congress (2015-2016)\\" Congress.gov, August 5, 2016 In the run-up to the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the Democratic Platform Committee approved a plank supporting the addition of a public option onto the Affordable Care Act.Alex Seitz-Wald, Democrats Advance Most Progressive Platform in Party History, NBC News (July 10, 2016). The decision was seen as a compromise measure between the Hillary Clinton campaign who during the 2016 presidential primaries advocated for keeping and reforming the ACA, and the Bernie Sanders campaign who advocated for repealing and replacing the ACA with a single-payer Medicare for All program. The Clinton campaign stated shortly before the plank was added that as president Clinton would \\"pursue efforts to give Americans in every state in the country the choice of a public-option insurance plan\\", while Bernie Sanders applauded the decision to \\"see that all Americans have the right to choose a public option in their health care exchange, which will lower the cost of healthcare\\".Hillary Clinton: The Briefing: Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Commitment: Universal, Quality, Affordable Health Care for Everyone in America. July 9, 2016.Truth Out: \\"Sanders Cites Democratic Platform, Public Option as Basis for Endorsing Clinton\\". July 13, 2016. The call was echoed by President Obama, who in an article for the American Medical Association stated that Congress \\"should revisit a public plan to compete alongside private insurers in areas of the country where competition is limited.\\"NPR: Obama Renews Call For A 'Public Option' In Federal Health Law. July 11, 2016.  Debate and action since 2016  In the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, the public option, \\"once considered too far-reaching\\", had become \\"seen as a more moderate alternative\\" to proposals like Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan. A majority of candidates running in the Democratic primary, including Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, preferred a healthcare plan that included a public option over a single payer plan, and some candidates who preferred a single payer plan said they would also accept a public option as a compromise or step along the way to single payer, such as Elizabeth Warren, who initially said \\"there‚Äôs no excuse for stopping at half-measures\\" regarding single payer, but would later pivot to supporting the enactment of a public option first before transitioning to a single payer system. Attempts to implement a public option have also been made at the state level. In May 2019, a law was passed and signed in Washington for the establishment of a public option, which is the first law for a public option to be passed at the state level, and is intended make a public option plan for purchase in 2021. Additionally, New Mexico and Colorado have passed legislation establishing official studies into a state-level public option and have been pursuing further action, while Delaware, Oregon, and Massachusetts have completed similar studies looking into state-level public options but have taken no additional action, and other state legislatures have considered either outright enacting a public option or at least passing legislation to establish an official study on a potential public option plan. Rationale The purpose behind the public option was to make more affordable health insurance for uninsured citizens who are either unable to afford the premiums of private health insurers or are rejected by private health insurers due to pre-existing condition. Supporters also argued (and proposed possible ways) that a government insurance company (public option) could put pressure on private health insurance companies to lower their premium costs and accept more reasonable profit margins, while also encouraging them to create more competitive plans with wider coverage, as well as eventually creating a more competitive, reasonably priced healthcare market across the industry by encouraging more efficient treatments and practices, and finally, eventually generating a large source of non-tax revenue for the government, which could help ease the rate of increasing budgetary deficit. Proponents proposed this would be accomplished by initially paying doctors and hospitals 4%-5% higher for claims than the average paid by private insurers but charging lower premiums than them, thus creating a more widely accepted, competitive product- making it the obvious choice and forcing private health insurers to create their own, similar reasonably priced, more full-featured insurance plans. A public option would be able to offer such competitive options, as they would not be operating as a traditional for-profit business, whereby the main priority is maximization of profits, as is the case of private health insurers- but instead operate much like a non-profit organization, whereby all funds acquired through premiums (minus operating expenses), could be paid out on claims (directly benefiting the policy holder, rather than a disproportionate amount of revenue generated from premiums paid to the insurer by the policy holder serving typical corporate uses, such as multimillion dollar executive salaries and bonuses,Salary.com (Accessed: May 2nd, 2020): \\"Aetna Inc. Executive Salaries (Data for years 2006-2017)\\", Aetna. stock dividends,Street Insider (Accessed: May 2, 2020): \\"Quarterly Dividend History for Aetna Inc. Q4 2011-Q4 2018\\", Stock Dividend Aetna Inc. and excess cash flows). Additionally, government influence and power would be leveraged to encourage (primarily) hospitals (as well as medical groups and collectives) to switch medical workers currently paid directly by insurers on a claim-by-claim basis (i.e. for each individual procedure) to instead work as cooperatively as possible, in efficient teams, and receive income in salaries, which proponents believed would both be more efficient, and reduce the complexity associated with medical billing, simplifying both accounting and lowering overall healthcare costs. This primarily would only affect doctors, particularly specialists, such as surgeons, as most nurses and medical technicians are already paid salaried wages Washington Post: 8 Questions About Health-Care Reform.Gauvey Herbert, David (January 2, 2011) \\"Public Option\\" , National Journal. as well as pressuring healthcare provider groups and hospitals to research and employ the most cost effective methods and treatments, and work in more cooperative teams, which would allow for employees to be salaried, as opposed to the current system where the highest paid workers (mainly doctors and specialized teams) are paid individually for each procedure they perform/patient they treat.Washington Post: 8 Questions About Health-Care Reform. Supporters of a public plan, such as Washington Post columnist E. J. Dionne, argue that many places in the United States have monopolies in which one company, or a small set of companies, control the local market for health insurance. Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman also wrote that local insurance monopolies exist in many of the smaller states, accusing those who oppose the idea of a public insurance plan as defenders of local monopolies. He also argued that traditional ideas of beneficial market competition do not apply to the insurance industry given that insurers mainly compete by risk selection, claiming that \\"[t]he most successful companies are those that do the best job of denying coverage to those who need it most.\\" Economist and former US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich argued that only a \\"big, national, public option\\" can force insurance companies to cooperate, share information, and reduce costs while accusing insurance and pharmaceutical companies of leading the campaign against the public option. Many Democratic politicians were publicly in favor of the public option for a variety of reasons. President Obama continued campaigning for the public option during the debate. In a public rally in Cincinnati on September 7, 2009, President Obama said: \\"I continue to believe that a public option within the basket of insurance choices would help improve quality and bring down costs.\\" The President also addressed a Joint Session of Congress on September 9, 2009, reiterating his call for a public insurance option, saying that he had \\"no interest in putting insurance companies out of business\\" while saying that the public option would \\"have to be self-sufficient\\" and succeed by reducing overhead costs and profit motives. Democratic Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, who represents the 18th congressional district in Houston, believed that a \\"vigorous public option\\" would be included in the final bill and would \\"benefit the state of Texas.\\"Houston Chronicle: Jackson Lee predicts \\"vigorous public option\\" on health care. July 31, 2009 Alternative plans The final bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, included provisions to open health insurance exchanges in each state by October 1, 2013. As the Act requires Americans to purchase health insurance, the federal government will offer subsidies to Americans with income levels up to four times the federal poverty level.CNN: The marketing of Obamacare exchanges begins. June 21, 2013. An alternative proposal is to subsidize private, non- profit health insurance cooperatives to get them to become large and established enough to possibly provide cost savings\\"Are health care co-ops the answer for reforming the system?\\" Kansas City Star Democratic politicians such as Howard Dean were critical of abandoning a public option in favor of co-ops, raising questions about the ability of the cooperatives to compete with existing private insurers. Paul Krugman also questioned the ability of cooperatives to compete.New York Times: \\"\\"Baucus and the Threshold\\"\\", Paul Krugman, September 17, 2009 While politically difficult, some politicians and observers have argued for a single-payer system. A bill, the United States National Health Care Act, was first proposed by Representative John Conyers in 2003 and has been perennially proposed since, including during the debate on the public option and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\\"House Reps Introduce Medicare-for-All Bill\\" Becker's Hospital Review, Feb. 14, 2013 President Obama came out against a single-payer reform, stating in the joint session of Congress that \\"it makes more sense to build on what works and fix what doesn't, rather than try to build an entirely new system from scratch.\\"Remarks by the President to a joint session of Congress on health care Obama had previously expressed that he is a proponent of a single payer universal health care program during an AFL-CIO conference in 2003.\\"Obama on single payer health insurance\\" Youtube] A number of alternatives to the public option were proposed in the Senate. Instead of creating a network of statewide public plans, Senator Olympia Snowe proposed a \\"trigger\\" in which a plan would be put into place at some point in the future in states that do not have more than a certain number of private insurance competitors. Senator Tom Carper has proposed an \\"opt-in\\" system in which state governments choose for themselves whether or not to institute a public plan. Senator Chuck Schumer has proposed an \\"opt-out\\" system in which state governments would initially be part of the network but could choose to avoid offering a public plan. In January 2013, Representative Jan Schakowsky and 44 other U.S. House of Representatives Democrats introduced , the \\"Public Option Deficit Reduction Act\\", which would amend the 2010 Affordable Care Act to create a public option. The bill would set up a government-run health insurance plan with premiums 5% to 7% percent lower than private insurance, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating a reduction in the United States public debt by $104 billion over 10 years. Opposition and criticism Both before and after passage in the House, significant controversy surrounded the Stupak‚ÄìPitts Amendment, added to the bill to prohibit coverage of abortions ‚Äì with limited exceptions ‚Äì in the public option or in any of the health insurance exchange's private plans sold to customers receiving federal subsidies. In mid-November, it was reported that 40 House Democrats would not support a final bill containing the Amendment's provisions.Alec MacGillis, \\"Health-care reform and abortion coverage: Questions and answers\\", Washington Post, November 14, 2009. The Amendment was abandoned after a deal was struck between Representative Bart Stupak and his voting bloc would vote for the bill as written in exchange for the signing of Executive Order 13535. Republican House Minority Whip Eric Cantor has argued that a public plan would compete unfairly with private insurers and drive many of them out of business.Molly Hooper, \\"Cantor: Public option poll 'skewed, Blog Briefing Room, 10/21/09 Michael F. Cannon, a senior fellow of the libertarian CATO Institute, has argued that the federal government can hide inefficiencies in its administration and draw away consumers from private insurance even if the government offers an inferior product. A study by the Congressional Budget Office found that profits accounted for only about 4 or 5 percent of private health insurance premiums, and Cannon argued that the lack of a profit motive reduces incentives to eliminate wasteful administrative costs. Dr. Robert E. Moffit of the Heritage Foundation has argued that a public plan in competition in private plans would likely be used as a \\"dumping ground\\" for families and individuals with higher than average health risks. This, in his view, would lead to costs that business should pay being passed onto the taxpayer. Marcia Angell, M. D., Senior Lecturer in the Department of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School and former Editor-in-Chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, believes that the result of a public option would be more \\"under-55's\\" opting to pay the fine rather than purchase insurance under a public option scenario, instead advocating lowering the Medicare age to 55.The Huffington Post: \\"Is the House Health Care Bill Better than Nothing?\\" Marcia Angell, M. D., November 9, 2009. The chief executive of Aetna, Ron Williams, argued against the public option based on issues of fairness. On the News Hour with Jim Lehrer, Williams noted that a public option creates a situation where \\"you have in essence a player in the industry who is a participant in the market, but also is a regulator and a referee in the game\\". He said, \\"we think that those two roles really don't work well.\\" Public opinion Public polling consistently showed majority support for a public option. A July 2009 survey by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute found that 28% of Americans would like to purchase a public plan while 53% would prefer to have a private plan. It also stated that 69% would support its creation in the first place. Survey USA estimated that the majority of Americans (77%) feel that it is either \\"Quite Important\\" or \\"Extremely Important\\" to \\"give people a choice of both a public plan administered by the federal government and a private plan for their health insurance\\" in August 2009. A Rasmussen Reports poll taken on August 17‚Äì18 stated that 57% of Americans did not support the current health care bill being considered by Congress that did not include a public option, a change from their findings in July 2009. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, conducted August 15‚Äì17, found that 47% of Americans opposed the idea of a public option and 43% expressed support. A Pew Research Center report published on October 8, 2009 stated that 55% of Americans favor a government health insurance plan to compete with private plans. The results were very similar to their polling from July, which found 52% support. An October 2009 Washington Post/ABC poll showed 57% support,Washington Post: Public option gains support. October 20, 2009. a USA Today/Gallup survey described by a USA Today article on October 27 found that 50% of Americans supported a government plan proposal, and a poll from November 10 and 11 by Angus Reid Public Opinion found that 52% of Americans supported a public plan. On October 27, journalist Ray Suarez of The News Hour with Jim Lehrer noted that \\"public opinion researchers say the tide has been shifting over the last several weeks, and now is not spectacularly, but solidly in favor of a public option.\\" Between October 28 and November 13, 2009, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin's campaign organization polled Americans to rank their support for various forms of the \\"public option\\" currently under consideration by Congress for inclusion in the final health care reform bill. The 83,954 respondents assigned rankings of 0 to 10. A full national option had the most support, with an 8.56 average, while no public option was least favored, with a 1.10 average.Dick Durbin Public Option Poll Results GetActive Software, Inc., 16-Nov-2009 Polls during 2019 have shown a majority support for a public option, including a Marist poll which found that 70% of Americans supported a public option while 25% opposed it, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll which found that 69% of Americans supported a public option while 29% opposed it, and Quinnipiac poll found that 58% of Americans supported a public option while 27% opposed it. Physician reaction A survey designed and conducted by Drs. Salomeh Keyhani and Alex Federman of Mount Sinai School of Medicine done over the summer of 2009 found that 73% of doctors supported a public option. A survey reported by the New England Journal of Medicine in September, based on a random sample of 6,000 physicians from the American Medical Association, stated that \\"it seems clear that the majority of U.S. physicians support using both public and private insurance options to expand coverage.\\"Salomeh Keyhani, M.D., M.P.H., and Alex Federman, M.D., M.P.H. \\"Doctors on Coverage ‚Äî Physicians' Views on a New Public Insurance Option and Medicare Expansion\\" NEJM ‚Ä¢ September 14th, 2009. Conversely, a 2009 IBD/TIPP poll of 1,376 physicians showed that 45% of doctors \\"would consider leaving or taking early retirement\\" if Congress passes the health care plan wanted by the White House and Democrats. This poll also found that 65% of physicians oppose the White House and Democratic version of health reform. Statistician and polling expert Nate Silver has criticized that IBD/TIPP poll for what he calls its unusual methodology and bias and for the fact that it was incomplete when published as responses were still coming in.IBD/TIPP doctors poll is not trustworthy In 2019, the American College of Physicians, the second largest physicians group in the United States, endorsed both single payer and a public option for US healthcare reform.

The law on amnesty was passed by the Polish Sejm on February 22, 1947. The actual purpose of the amnesty was the liquidation of coordinated resistance to the newly established communist regime. The promise of amnesty was not kept. Information collected during questioning of the \\"cursed soldiers\\" who had revealed themselves led to a later round of arrests and repression, including of those who stayed in hiding. This was the second amnesty in Poland after World War II. The first one lasted from July 22, 1945, until October 15, 1945. The Amnesty The Amnesty was in effect for two months, from February 25 until April 25, 1947. There was no provision for its extension. The execution of the amnesty law was placed in the hands of the Ministry of Public Security (UB). The amnesty did not apply to the members of the Ukrainian nationalist organizations, such as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, as were considered allies of Nazi Germany by the communist government.Philipp Ther, Ana Siljak, \\"Redrawing nations: ethnic cleansing in East-Central Europe, 1944-1948.\\" Marek Jasiak, \\"Overcoming resistance.\\" Rowman & Littlefield, 2001, pg. 182. . Throughout Poland, special \\"National Amnesty Committees\\" were formed, attached to the local stations of the Polish political police, UB. Each person who gave himself up as part of the amnesty had to give up his weapons, if he had any, fill out a detailed form in which he revealed the underground resistance group he was a member of, as well as his conspiratorial code name and other information.Ewa Blankiewicz, \\"Ostatni Lesni - Wystawa IPN\\" (The last Forest brothers - An IPN presentation). Gazeta Ciechanow, March 2005 During the amnesty, from fifty- three to fifty-five thousand people came out of the underground and presented themselves to the authorities.Curtis Peebles, \\"Twilight warriors: covert air operations against the USSR\\", Naval Institute Press, 2005, pg. 44, A further 23,257 persons who had already been imprisoned declared themselves members of underground organizations in order to take advantage of the law. All together the amnesty ended up covering 76,774 people. For the most part these consisted of soldiers from various underground organizations, such as Freedom and Independence (WiN) and National Armed Forces (NSZ), as well as deserters from the Polish People's Army, the milicja (MO) and the UB. According to official statistics of the Ministry of Public Security, 90% of all members of the organization Freedom and Independence revealed themselves, and about 60% of all members of National Armed Forces. For comparison, in the previous amnesty of 1945, only 30,217 persons left the underground resistance many of whom soon returned to actively fighting the communist government. Consequences As a result, after the expiration of the deadline in 1947, there remained no more than two thousand soldiers in the armed anti-communist underground.S≈Çawomir Poleszak, \\"Ostatni Niezlomni\\" (The Last Unbroken). Rzeczpospolita, 17 December 2007. A well-organized resistance practically ceased to exist. Thanks to the information obtained from those who gave themselves up, the UB was able to more quickly hunt down and eliminate those who remained in the underground. Almost as soon as the amnesty expired the communist authorities began to go back on their promises. All the information was analyzed and many of the former soldiers were called back to give more information about their friends and fellow soldiers who remained in the underground. Many of them were consequently arrested on trumped-up charges. Between 1948 and 1950 a further number were arrested on charges which were supposed to have been covered by the amnesty. A number of those who had given themselves up, as a result, returned to the underground although they mostly ceased participation in armed resistance.

An alternate game mode, \\"Thrusty Mode\\", has the mouse control the thrust vector of the player's ship, with rotation becoming automatic; this is unlocked when the second difficulty level is completed for the first time. * \\"Sheepies\\" fall from the top of the screen at regular intervals; collecting a sheepie increases the score multiplier by 1 and upgrades the ship's weaponry. When the player's ship is destroyed, it is thrown slightly upwards and then begins to fall off the bottom of the screen; if it falls completely off the bottom, a life is lost. The player may move their ship left and right to cause it to bounce off active enemies, and collecting a sheepie in this state brings the ship back to life without a life being lost (a \\"sheepie save\\"). * The player can choose between several different ships, with different firing patterns. The player can switch between ships on the fly, using the keyboard or mouse wheel. Each ship represents one of the player's lives, so when a life is lost, so is the ship that was in use at the time; and gaining extra lives makes new ships available. In addition, there are four \\"super ship types\\" that must be unlocked, by completing each of the four difficulty levels, in order to be added to the rotation of possible ships. * Certain levels feature \\"suns\\", which cause the player's shots to bend with gravity. Using more intricate bullet routes to shoot enemies yields more points. Shooting at the sun eventually transforms it into a \\"black hole\\", which grants an extra ship and removes the normal 9x limit on the score multiplier. The sun or black hole may also fire shots at the player; on the earlier difficulty levels, the black hole does not fire, and thus opening the black hole may be used to stop the sun from firing. On the later difficulty levels, the black hole also fires. * There are 50 stages, which can be played on multiple difficulty levels: Korma, Madras, Vindaloo and Phall. However, the stages are not played in strict order: when first started, only levels 1-20 of Korma are available. When level 20 is completed, the player is deemed to have completed the mode, and levels 1-30 of Madras are unlocked; every level from 21-30 of Madras completed unlocks the corresponding level in Korma. This pattern continues through all of the difficulty levels. * Simulated versions of the original VIC-20 and C64 releases of Gridrunner are included.YakYak forum post Reception The first online review, by Eurogamer, awarded the game 8/10http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/gridrunner-revolution-article Gamereactor - 8/10 Swedish website via Google Translate Hardcore Gamer - 4.5/5http://www.hardcoregamer.com/index.php?option=com_magazine&id;_rubrique=1&type;=article&id;_article=381 Wired News - 9/10https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/10/gridrunner-revolution- review/ Destructoid - 7.5/10http://www.destructoid.com/review-gridrunner- revolution-150760.phtml GameSpot - Hands-On preview Dead Pixel Live - 8/10 8-Bit Rocket - Grade A  References   External links  * Matt Cundy's preview of Gridrunner Revolution - 2009's most insane shooter for Games Radar * Mersey Remakes' review of Gridrunner Revolution * 42 screenshots at gamespot.com Category:2009 video games Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Multidirectional shooters Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Llamasoft games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games using procedural generation ","title":"Gridrunner Revolution"},{"id":"24008927","text":"Jangziceras is a genus of fossil nautiloid cephalopods from the Middle Silurian of southern China belonging to the Orthocerida incertae sedis, its familial association undetermined.

Rovers next manager, Steve Wignall, seemed to alienate the striker infuriating the fans with whom he had become a favourite. He spent October and November 2000 on loan to Kingstonian helping them reach the 4th round of the FA Cup. Even ten years on from his time at Rovers, the phrase \\"Get Duerden on!\\" is used by some fans as a way of expressing a frustration with the managers game plan and a desire for that something extra needed on the pitch.http://vivarovers.wordpress.com/2011/12/01/new-t-shirts-in-the-viva- rovers-shop/ Unhappy with a lack of first team appearances for Rovers, in January 2001 Duerden was sold to Kingstonian.http://www.itnsource.com/fr/shotlist//UTV/1996/10/22/UTV19961022015/?s=*http://kingstonian.net/appearances.jsp?player=51&season;=164 He then moved to Barrow and later to Hucknall Town where he scored on his debut.http://www.hucknalldispatch.co.uk/sport/town_in_the_hunt_for_huckerby_1_668138http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/heaven_sent_town_1_672146 Here his professional career ended prematurely due to a series of injuries throughout the years.

The United States Navy currently operates 95 total nuclear power plants including 71 submarines (each with one reactor), 11 aircraft carriers (each with two reactors), and 4 training/research prototype plants.  Overview  Naval Nuclear Power Training Command Logo Prospective enlisted enrollees in the Nuclear Power Program must have qualifying line scores on the ASVAB exam, may need to pass the NAPT (nuclear aptitude test), and must undergo a NACLC investigation for attaining a \\"Secret\\" security clearance. Additionally, each applicant must pass an interview with the Advanced Programs Coordinator in the associated recruiting district. All officer students have had college-level courses in calculus and calculus-based physics. Acceptance to the officer program requires successful completion of interviews at Naval Reactors in Washington, D.C., and a final approval via a direct interview with the Director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion, a unique eight-year, four-star admiral position which was originally held by the program's founder, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover. Women were allowed into the Naval Nuclear Field from 1978 until 1980, when the Navy began only allowing men again. With the repeal of the Combat Exclusion Law in the 1994 Defense Authorization Act, and the decision to open combatant ships to women, the Navy once again began accepting women into NNPS for duty aboard nuclear-powered surface combatant ships. Female graduates of NNPS may serve at shore commands and on aircraft carriers. In November 2015, the first female Reactor Officer, Commander Erica L. Hoffmann, took command of Reactor Department onboard . Female officers may also serve aboard SSBN and SSGN submarines. The first female officers bound for submarines began training at NNPTC in late August 2010. Enlisted personnel graduate from Nuclear Field \\"A\\" School for rating as Machinist's Mate (MMN), Electrician's Mate (EMN), or Electronics Technician (ETN) and are advanced to the rank of a Third Class Petty Officer. They then continue to Nuclear Power School. Graduates of the Nuclear Power School continue training with twenty-four weeks of instruction at a Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU). This training involves the operation and simulated maintenance of nuclear reactor plants and steam plants. Graduates of NPTU are qualified nuclear operators and continue on to serve in the fleet, unless they are selected as a Junior Staff Instructor (JSI). JSIs go through training to be instructors at a NPTU where they will directly assist in qualifying future students. The enlisted school has a very high academic attrition rate and is considered by many to be one of the most academically challenging schools in the U.S. military. Sailors in the nuclear ratings account for 3% of the enlisted Navy. History of locations After Admiral Rickover became chief of a new section in the Bureau of Ships, the Nuclear Power Division, he began work with Alvin M. Weinberg, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) director of research, to initiate and develop the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology (ORSORT) and to begin the design of the pressurized water reactor for submarine propulsion. Training for Fleet operators was subsequently conducted by civilian engineers at Idaho Falls, Idaho (1955-1958) and West Milton, New York (1955-1956). The first formal Nuclear Power School was established in New London, Connecticut in January 1956 with a pilot course offered for six officers and fourteen enlisted men. This school remained in use through Class 62-2 in 1962. After which the school was relocated to Bainbridge, Maryland. Subsequent locations include Naval Training Center Bainbridge, Maryland (1962-1976); Mare Island Naval Shipyard, California (1958-1976); Naval Training Center Orlando, Florida (1976-1998) and its current location, Goose Creek, South Carolina. In 1986, Nuclear Field A School was established in Orlando to provide nuclear in-rate training to Sailors prior to attending Nuclear Power School. In 1993, in response to the BRAC-directed closure of NTC Orlando by the end of Fiscal Year 1999, the Nuclear Field A School and Nuclear Power School were joined to create Naval Nuclear Power Training Command. A move from Orlando, Florida to Goose Creek, South Carolina began in May 1998 and was completed in January 1999. Construction of the new command allowed Nuclear Field A School and Nuclear Power School to be located in the same building. Many improvements were added to the command to improve each sailor's quality of life and the effectiveness of training. The Bachelor Enlisted Quarters include microwaves and refrigerators along with semiprivate rooms joined by a common bath. The complex also includes a galley, recreation building, and recreation fields conveniently located for the sailors' use. The NNPTC complex when fully manned, can accommodate over 3,600 students and 480 staff members. Naval Health Clinic Charleston is located across NNPTC Circle from the NNPTC site and is a short walk from the main Rickover Center building. Curriculum The following topics are learned in the curriculum for all program attendees: *Mathematics *Calculus-based physics *Fluid Dynamics *Applied Hydraulics *Nuclear physics *Electrical power theory and generating equipment *Nuclear reactor technology *Thermodynamics *Heat Transfer *Chemistry *Materials science and metallurgy *Health physics *Reactor principles *Reactor ethics Even more intensive than the enlisted course, the officer course involves extensive post-calculus mathematical examination of reactor dynamics. Officers cover all topics in equal depth, whereas enlisted training is specialized for each student's job rating (with significant cross-training in the remaining nuclear specialties). The officer course also requires students to have undergraduate engineering or science degrees.Submarine Officer The nuclear program is widely acknowledged as having the most demanding academic program in the U.S. military. The school operates at a fast pace, with stringent academic standards in all subjects. Students typically spend 45 hours per week in the classroom, and are required to study an additional 10 to 35 hours per week outside lecture hours, five days per week. Because the classified materials are restricted from leaving the training building, students cannot study outside the classroom. Students who fail tests and otherwise struggle academically are required to review their performance with instructors. The student may be given remedial homework or other study requirements. Failing scores due to personal negligence, rather than a lack of ability, can result in charges of dereliction of duty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Failing students may be held back to repeat the coursework with a new group of classmates, but such students are typically released from the Nuclear Power Program and are re-designated or discharged. College credit (enlisted training) The American Council of Education recommends an average of 60-80 semester-hours of college credit, in the lower-division baccalaureate/associate degree category, for completion of the entire curriculum including both Nuclear Field \\"A\\" School and Naval Nuclear Power School. The variation in total amount depends on the specific pipeline completed -- MM, EM, or ET. Further, under the Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges degree program for the Navy (SOCNAV), the residency requirements at these civilian institutions are reduced to only 10-25%, allowing a student to take as little as 9 units of coursework (typically 3 courses) through the degree-granting institution to complete their Associate in Applied Science degree in nuclear engineering technology or as much as 67 units to complete a bachelor's degree in Nuclear Engineering Technology or Nuclear Energy Engineering Technology. The following select colleges offer college credit and degree programs to graduates of the U.S. Naval Nuclear Power School (NNPS): *Thomas Edison State University School of Applied Science and Technology Bachelor of Science in Applied Science and Technology (BSAST) Degree is designed for graduates of the U.S. Navy nuclear power program and degrees granted after October 2010 are accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission (TAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). *Old Dominion University's Batten College of Engineering & Technology offers a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission (TAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).

The Excelsior College baccalaureate degree program in nuclear engineering technology is also accredited by TAC of ABET. *Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering, in cooperation with the Education for Working Professionals Office and the U.S. Navy, have developed undergraduate degree programs in nuclear engineering for graduates of the U.S. Navy Nuclear Power Training School. College equivalence The American Council on Education has evaluated the course of instruction at NNPTC and recommended the following credits be given for completion of the enlisted curriculum: *5 hours in general physics *3 hours in heat transfer and fluid flow *3 hours in nuclear reactor engineering *1 hour in atomic and nuclear physics *1 hour in radiation protection technology *3 hours in general chemistry and principles of materials *4 hours in technical mathematics. Additionally, for Machinist's Mates *3 hours in applied thermodynamics and heat transfer *3 hours in power plant systems *2 hours in hydraulic systems For Electronics Technicians and Electrician's Mates *3 hours in basic electricity *2 hours in DC circuits *2 hours in AC circuits *2 hours in digital principles *2 hours in electric machines The Catholic University of America offers graduate level credit for completion of the officer training course.The Catholic University of America Retrieved February 17, 2019. Nuclear Power Training Unit Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU), one of which is also located at the former Naval Weapons Station Charleston, has three decommissioned submarines. The first two are ex- (MTS-626) and ex- (MTS-635). These moored training ships have their missile compartments removed, but have fully operational S5W reactor power plants. The most recent addition to the NPTU pier is the , which was placed in commissioned (Reserve, Stand down) status in February 2015 for conversion to a Moored Training Ship (MTS). During that time, the submarine was cut into three pieces, and a portion of the hull was taken out. Three new hull sections from General Dynamics Electric Boat were added to accommodate the sub's new mission. A newly fabricated hull section was welded in place, containing training spaces, office spaces, and a Supplemental Water Injection System (SWIS) to provide emergency cooling water in the event of an accident. The MTS-701 will be permanently moored at Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU) at Naval Support Activity Charleston in South Carolina. The MTS-701 arrived in Goose Creek via tug in late 2019 and has since been cleared for student training. La Jolla is the first to undergo the conversion to a training ship and will be followed by about two years after, according to the Navy's long- range ship decommissioning plans. All moored training ships are equipped with a diesel generator-powered Supplemental Water Injection System (SWIS) to provide emergency cooling water in the event of an accident. Two land-based reactor prototypes are based at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, Kenneth A. Kesselring Site Operation, in Ballston Spa, New York. These are the MARF/S7G and the S8G Trident prototypes. The S8G core has now been replaced with the S6W reactor core. At one time, two additional prototypes were operational: D1G and S3G. NPTU History Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in New York has the longest operational history of NPTUs. However, two other sites also provided operational training during the Cold War. From the early 1950s to the mid-1990s, Naval Reactors Facility (NRF) in Idaho trained nearly 40,000 Navy personnel in surface and submarine nuclear power plant operations with three nuclear propulsion prototypes -- A1W, S1W, and S5G. From 1959 until 1993, over 14,000 Naval operators were trained at the S1C prototype at Windsor, Connecticut.

The film is based on the historical novel of the same name by Theodosia Harris, and features an ensemble cast including Sam De Grasse, Douglas Fairbanks, Walter Long and Alfred Paget. Fairbanks role was uncredited, and was his first role in film, although his first starring role, in The Lamb, was released prior to this picture. The film features the Siege of B√©xar, Battle of the Alamo and Battle of San Jacinto. While making claims to historical accuracy, the film depicts the Mexican population in San Antonio in 1836 as a group of ill- mannered drunks. One scene depicts a Mexican officer verbally assaulting a white woman and making advances on her. The white woman reports the incident to her husband, Almeron Dickinson, who in turn shoots the Mexican officer. In his book Remembering the Alamo, author Richard R. Flores, argues that the negative portrayal of the Mexican population is due to racism toward Mexicans in 1915, the year the film was produced.

He was associated with early battles of the IX Corps as well as Union involvement in North Carolina and the Tidewater region of Virginia. Early life Harland was born in Norwich, Connecticut, and graduated from Yale University in 1853. He was admitted to the bar and was practicing law prior to the Civil War. Civil War In 1861 Harland became a captain in the 3rd Connecticut Volunteer Infantry and fought at the First Battle of Bull Run.Antietam on the Web On October 5, 1861, he was appointed colonel of the 8th Connecticut InfantryEicher, p. 280. and served in Ambrose E. Burnside's North Carolina Expedition. In July 1862 he returned to Virginia with Burnside where his regiment became part of the newly formed IX Corps. Harland was placed in command of the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, IX Corps and led it at the battles of South Mountain and Antietam. At the Battle of Antietam, Harland's brigade participated in the actions around Burnside Bridge and Antietam Creek. His division commander, Brig. Gen. Isaac P. Rodman, was sent on a flanking maneuver across Snavely's Ford. Around 1 p.m. Rodman's troops were eventually able to cross the ford and flank the Confederates under Robert Toombs. As the division moved toward Sharpsburg, General Rodman was mortally wounded and removed from the field. Harland, being the senior ranking colonel, assumed command of the 3rd Division. Harland remained in command of the division until he was replaced by Brig. Gen. George W. Getty. Harland returned to command the 2nd Brigade and led it at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Sometime after Fredericksburg, Harland was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers, effective November 29, 1862. In March 1863 Getty's division was sent to the VII Corps in the Tidewater region of Virginia. Harland's brigade now became the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, VII Corps during the siege of Suffolk. After the Confederates lifted the siege, Harland was transferred to the XVIII Corps in North Carolina for the second half of 1863. He commanded the Sub-district of Pamlico for a short time before he was assigned to command the Defenses of New Bern in July 1864. He remained in command at New Bern until January 1865 when Union forces under Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield were moving inland from Wilmington, North Carolina, to link up with the armies of Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman. Harland‚Äôs forces became the 1st Brigade, 1st Division in Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox's Provisional Corps and fought at the Battle of Wyse Fork. Postbellum career Harland resigned from the army on June 22, 1865, and resumed his law practice. He served as a state legislator in Connecticut and was active in the militia, becoming the state's adjutant general. He also served as a judge and banker before dying in his hometown of Norwich.

The strata from which remains of Menatalligator have been found are part of the Cha√Æne des Puys, a volcanically active chain of mountains in the Massif Central. The deposit is thought to have formed through the deposition of sediments in a body of water that filled a volcanic crater during the early Eocene (Ypresian). Fossil fish such as Amia valenciennense and Thaumaturus have been found from the same strata as Menatalligator, and most likely comprised a portion of its diet.

She is recognized by the Boston Athletic Association as the pre-sanctioned era women‚Äôs winner in 1966, 1967, and 1968. At the Boston Marathon, the pre-sanctioned era comprised the years from 1966 through 1971, when women, who could not compete in the Men's Division, ran and finished the race. In 1996 the B.A.A. retroactively recognized as champions the women who finished first in the Pioneer Women's Division Marathon for the years 1966‚Äì1971. Gibb‚Äôs run in 1966 challenged prevalent prejudices and misconceptions about women's athletic capabilities.http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/communication/pdf/thesis08.zaccone.pdf In 1967, she finished nearly an hour ahead of Kathrine Switzer, who had registered to run in the Boston marathon which at that time did not bar women from competing officially. Switzer was repeatedly assaulted during the race by the race manager, Jock Semple, who tried to remove her race number and prevent her completing the race. In 1968 Gibb finished first among five women that ran the marathon unregistered. It was not until late 1971, pursuant to a petition to the Amateur Athletic Union by Nina Kuscsik, that the AAU changed its rules and began to sanction women's division marathons. Kuscsik won the initial AAU- sanctioned women's division race at Boston in 1972.  Biography   Early life  Bobbi Gibb grew up in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts during the 1940s and 1950s. She studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and Tufts University School of Special Studies.National Art Museum of Sport: Sculptor was first woman to complete the Boston Marathon Her father was a professor of chemistry at Tufts. She was already running through the woods with the neighborhood dogs when, in 1962, she met a middle distance runner at Tufts named William Bingay, who would later enlist in the United States Navy and become her first husband.Derderian, Tom (1996). Boston Marathon: The History of the World‚Äôs Premier Running Event. Champaign, Illinois: Human Kinetics Publishers. They married on February 5, 1966, in California. Her running included daily commuting of the eight miles to school. She ran in white leather Red Cross nurses' shoes because there were no running shoes available for women at the time.  Boston Marathon  Before 1966, the longest Amateur Athletic Union (AAU)-sanctioned race for women was one and a half miles. Until 1972, when the first women's division marathon opened, the Boston Marathon was an AAU men‚Äôs division race. Therefore, none of the pioneer women who ran before 1972 were credited for their efforts by the AAU, although the Boston Marathon rule book until after the 1967 race did not bar women from entering the race as officially registered competitors. It was not until after Kathrine Switzer's official entry in and completion of the 1967 Boston Marathon that the AAU changed its rules to ban women from competing in races against men in the US. Gibb trained for two years to run the Boston Marathon, covering as much as 40 miles in one day. Gibb, Bobbi. To Boston with Love: The Story of the First Woman to Run the Boston Marathon On writing for an application in February 1966, she received a letter from the race director, Will Cloney, informing her that women were not physiologically capable of running marathon distances and that under the rules that governed amateur sports set out by the AAU, women were not allowed to run more than a mile and a half competitively. She realized that it was more important than ever to run and that her run would have a social significance far beyond just her own personal challenge. After three nights and four days on a bus from San Diego, California, Gibb arrived the day before the race at her parents' house in Winchester, Massachusetts. On the morning of Patriots' Day, April 19, 1966, her mother dropped her off at the start in Hopkinton. Wearing her brother‚Äôs Bermuda shorts and a blue hooded sweatshirt over a black, tanked-top swim suit, she hid in the bushes near the starting pen. After the starting gun fired, she waited until about half the pack had started and then jumped into the race. The men soon realized that she was a woman. Encouraged by their friendliness and support, she removed her sweatshirt. To her delight and relief, the crowds cheered to see a woman running. The press began to report on her progress towards Boston. Diana Chapman Walsh, later President of Wellesley College, recalled the day years later: By the time Gibb reached the finish line in Boston, the Governor of Massachusetts, John Volpe, was there to shake her hand. She finished in three hours, twenty-one minutes and forty seconds, ahead of two-thirds of the runners. The following morning her feat was front-page news in the Record American, where the headline read: ‚ÄúHub Bride First Gal to Run Marathon.‚Äù(April 20, 1966). ‚ÄúHub Bride First Gal to Run Marathon‚Äù. Record American In another Record American article entitled ‚ÄúRoberta Gets Official Support: Females May Run Marathon,‚Äù Jack Kendall wrote: The May 2, 1966, issue of Sports Illustrated featured an article written by Gwilym S. Brown entitled ‚ÄúA Game Girl In A Man‚Äôs Game‚Äù: In 1967, Gibb, by then a full-time student at the University of California, San Diego, ran again. She finished in three hours, twenty-seven minutes and seventeen seconds, almost an hour ahead of another female competitor, Kathrine Switzer. Switzer had officially registered for the race in full compliance with the race rules, which at that time made no mention of gender, but was famously repeatedly assaulted by race manager Jock Semple in his attempts to prevent her completing the race. Gibb, who ran unnumbered, was not similarly bothered. In 1968, Gibb ran again, finishing in three hours and thirty minutes, first among a growing number of women, which included Carol Ann Pancko, Elaine Pederson, and Marjorie Fish.McLaughlin, Dan and Bill Duncliffe (1968). \\"Babes Bug BAA Bosses.\\" Record American. In 1969, 1970, and 1971, Sara Mae Berman was the women‚Äôs winner, and in 1972, Nina Kuscsik was the winner of the first officially sanctioned women‚Äôs division event. In 1996, at the 100th running of the Boston Marathon and the 30th anniversary of Gibb‚Äôs first run of it, the Boston Athletic Association officially recognized her three wins in 1966, 1967, and 1968 and awarded her a medal. Her name was inscribed with the names of the other winners on the Boston Marathon Memorial in Copley Square. In 2016, Gibb was the grand marshal of that year's Boston Marathon. That year's female winner, Atsede Baysa, gave Gibb her trophy; Gibb said that she would go to Baysa‚Äôs native Ethiopia in 2017 and return it to her.Atsede Baysa gives her Boston Marathon trophy to Bobbi Gibb - The Boston Globe  Education and career history  Gibb received her Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree from the University of California, San Diego in 1969, fulfilling the pre-medical requirements, with a major in philosophy and a minor in mathematics. She has reported she was denied admission to medical school because of her gender. Gibb then worked with Professor Jerome Lettvin at MIT on epistemology and color vision while studying law. In 1974, Gibb entered the New England School of Law, receiving her Juris Doctor (J.D.) in 1978. She worked as a legislative aide in the Massachusetts State Legislature, studied natural systems, and pursued her interest in sculpture and painting. She was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1978. While raising her family, she practiced law, specializing in real and intellectual property. She worked, for part of that time, in patent law with Jerry Cohen, Esq. Gibb sculpted the 12-inch bronze figurines of a pony-tailed girl running that were given as trophies to Joan Benoit Samuelson, Julie Brown, and Julie Isphording, the top three women marathoners at the US Olympic trials in 1984. Samuelson has commented on her trophy, stating: \\"There are only three in the world. It's irreplaceable.\\" Gibb has written a memoir entitled Wind in the Fire: A Personal Journey. A film based on her memoir and with the same title is currently in the works. She has been included in Who‚Äôs Who of American Women, Who‚Äôs Who in America, and Who‚Äôs Who in the World. In 1982 she was inducted into the Road Runners Club of America Long Distance Running Hall of Fame, and she has been interviewed for news programs and documentaries on ABC, CBS, NBC, ESPN, and HBO. She was included in the 1999 HBO Sports documentary Dare to Compete: The Struggle of Women in Sports. In 2000, she produced a documentary on her art and running entitled Where the Spirit Leads. Gibb received the 2009 Tufts University Athletics Distinguished Achievement Award and was inducted into The Sports Museum of New England Hall of Fame in 2011. Her Special Achievement Award was presented by Joan Benoit Samuelson at the Sports Museum's 10th Annual \\"The Tradition\\" on June 28, 2011. She pursues a career in art and writes on a wide range of topics including economics, spirituality, the nature of natural systems, and the phenomenon of subjective experience. Recently she joined the Cecil B. Day Neuromuscular Laboratory as an associate working to find the causes of and cures for neurodegenerative diseases, specifically amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. She divides her time between San Diego and Boston.

During World War II, commander of the Union of Retaliation, officer of the Union of Armed Struggle and the Kedyw of Home Army. President of the Freedom and Independence from 1945 to 1946 and political prisoner of the Stalinist period.  Biography  Franciszek Niepok√≥lczycki after arrest in 1946 Franciszek Niepok√≥lczycki during the show trial in 1947 From November 1918 on he was a member of Polish Military Organisation in Zhytomyr. During the Polish-Soviet War in 1920 he fought in irregular units. He served in the Polish Army from 1922 in the 10th Sapper Regiment in Przemy≈õl and in the 3rd Sapper Battalion in Wilno. He took part in the Invasion of Poland against Nazi invaders as commander of the 60th Sapper Battalion in Army Modlin. After the defeat of Poland he joined the anti-Nazi underground. As early as 27 September 1939 he joined Service for Poland's Victory, later transformed into Union of Armed Struggle (ZWZ). In 1940 he was made a leader of a special \\"Reprisal\\" unit of ZWZ charged with sabotage and armed struggle. He was a co-organizer of the Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion, Kedyw, of the Home Army, and in 1943 he was made the second in command of the unit, after Gen. Emil Fieldorf (\\"Nil\\"). He fought in the Warsaw Uprising as chief of the Sapper's Section of the 3rd Regiment of AK's Headquarters, with the rank of colonel. After the surrender of the uprising he was imprisoned and in January 1945 sent to The Woldenberg II C Oflag. After returning to Poland from his imprisonment he became once again involved in the resistance, this time directed against the new communist authorities. Initially he was the second in command of Col. Antoni Sanojcy of Region \\"South\\" of the Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, and later the president of the southern region for the organization Freedom and Independence (WiN). As president of WiN he took the step of recognizing the Polish Government in Exile (which by this time was no longer recognized as the official government of Poland by the Allies) as the legitimate governing body and took the decision of expanding the activities of WiN. He made the organization grow and hoped to lead it to a point where eventually it could be made legal. On 22 October 1946 Niepok√≥lczycki was arrested by the Polish secret police (UB) in Krakow. A year later, in a show trial of WiN leaders he was sentenced to death. This sentence was later changed to life imprisonment. On the wave of political changes in Polish October, on 22 December 1956 released from prison. After being released, he had no problems finding a job and received compensation. However, it was the object of observation by officers of the Security Service. He did not join the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy. From 1958 he was the deputy director of the plant at the Association of Polish Inventors. He was buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery in Brwin√≥w.

It was first published in 1963 in the magazine Galaxy Science Fiction. The story has been extensively collected for anthologies, most recently in 1999 for the collection Armageddons, edited by Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois. The story was originally written as a spoof history or possibly a future history. The narrator is a historian writing in the year 2073 about events taking place in 1973, 10 years from the story's actual publication date. From the point of view of 21st century readers it is sometimes thought of as an alternate history. Plot summary The story begins with an account of how geologists in the mid-1960s came to understand that the \\"Kiowa fault\\" in the state of Colorado was actually part of a larger fault system running along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains from Texas to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. In the summer of 1973 the land east of the fault slips downward, slowly but inexorably over the next few months, until the major rivers of the region (including the Mississippi) flood the new lowlands. The process is slow enough for people to flee eastwards, though conditions become more and more hazardous as the flooding increases. The story recounts how, during this time the various authorities such as the Federal government and the State governors, try to quell panic by invoking patriotism or, in the case of the governors, the stalwart nature of the people of the \\"great Southland\\". Despite this, the next act of nature proves even more cataclysmic. The Gulf coast of the United States, from western Florida to Lake Pontchartrain, simply sinks below sea level. The sea floods the new lowlands from the Texas Panhandle to North Dakota. As many as 14 million people perish. The state of Oklahoma is completely lost, as are most of the Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Arkansas. The Ozarks become an archipelago. There are tales of amazing escapes mentioned in the story, and of foolishness, as for instance when the governor of Kansas decides to stand fast and is wiped out along with most of his state. Finally the country is left divided by a new inland sea, almost as big as the Mediterranean. The economy recovers, and the climate of the inner part of the country actually improves due to the moderating effect of this large body of water. The state of Wyoming becomes \\"a new Riviera\\" while Missouri is a \\"second California\\". Minnesota loses its famously Arctic winters. The author comments wryly on the political fallout. The states which kept some portion of their land above water eventually demand their full representation in Congress, including two Senators each for several states which exist only as slivers of land. Trade and commerce flourish on the new waterway. Eventually the new sea can be fished to great profit. The story ends with an optimistic view of a vibrant future in which \\"fleets of all the world sail...where once the prairie schooner made its laborious and dusty way west!\\". In culture Blake Hodgetts has written a filk song based on the story, with the same title. It is included on his CD Blindsight.

They are known as B√©rullians or Oratorians.Britannica: \\"Oratorian\\" retrieved August 17, 2016 The French Oratory had a determinant influence on the French school of spirituality throughout the 17th century. It is separate and distinct from the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri, which served as its inspiration. The aim of the Society is to center spiritual life on the human aspect of Jesus, linked to the essence of God. Unlike the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri, whose communities are all autonomous, the French Oratory operates under the central authority of a Superior General. History Founding In France, B√©rulle, ordained a priest in 1599, felt that the clergy of the country had lost their spirit, seeking only the economic security of benefices. With the goal of restoring the spiritual commitment to their calling, on 11 November 1611, he and five other priests founded a society of priests, without the obligation of religious vows, in which one would dedicate one's entire strength to priestly perfection, in order to carry out all the functions of this ministry and to shape in piety those who aspired to this. B√©rulle hoped that such priests would both inspire others of the French clergy, and blunt the attraction of Calvinism.Williams, Charles E., The French Oratorians and Absolutism, 1611-1641 (New York: Lang, 1989), p. 71 Taking the example of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri in Rome, he envisioned secular clergy living together in community. However, B√©rulle felt that the situation in France required a tighter organizational structure than Neri's communities in Italy, so the French Oratory operated under the authority of a Superior General. The Oratory received letters patent from King Louis XIII of France that same year. Pope Paul V authorized them on 10 May 1613. At the time of the founder's death in 1629, the Oratory numbered about 400 priests, living in some 60 communities. The Oratorian college in Vend√¥me, to which the author Balzac was sent at the age of eight Like the Jesuits and Capuchins, members of the French Oratory conducted parish missions.Donnelly S.J., John \\"The Congregation of the Oratory\\", Religious Orders in the Catholic Reformation, (Richard DeMolen, ed.) New York: Fordham University Press, 1994, p. 205 The French Oratory became very important in the area of spiritual direction, as the Fathers of the congregation were confessors of influential people, for example Charles de Condren, confessor to Prince Gaston of France, King Louis' brother, and were protected by the royal court, especially Queen Marie de Medici. They also were confessors to numerous monasteries of Discalced Carmelite nuns, who had been established in France, through the efforts of B√©rulle, under the leadership of the Blessed Marie of the Incarnation, O.C.D. The church which the Oratorians built on the Rue Saint-Honor√© in 1750 became the parish church of the royal court. Although not a teaching order, it was the first to organize seminaries in France according to the ordinances of the Council of Trent.Ingold, Augustin. \\"French Congregation of the Oratory.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 3 January 2016 The Oratorians also became leading figures in the field of education in France and founded their own schools and colleges, such as the College of Juilly which they opened in 1638. In their schools, they taught in French, rather than the Latin used in the Jesuit schools. They had a curriculum which taught contemporary literature and the sciences. Their students learned modern foreign languages as opposed to the classical languages. Dispersal When the French Revolution broke out in 1789, initially the Fathers of the Oratory were very supportive of the ideals of liberty that it espoused, which fit into their corporate ethos. Despite this support, the Legislative Assembly of the new Republic dissolved all secular congregations in August 1792 and their communities and schools were disbanded. Some of the lay teachers in their schools, such as Jacques Nicolas Billaud- Varenne, became greatly involved with the Revolution. Of the 288 members of the Oratory at that time, 51 chose to accept the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. They made up about one-fifth of the French clergy who did so. Of the rest of the Congregation, 15 were arrested and died either in prison or on the guillotine. The rest went into hiding or fled the country. The last Superior General had died in 1790, but, given the social upheavals going on, the Oratorians decided to wait it out before attempting to elect a successor, thinking that the situation would be only temporary. Restoration Several attempts were made to re-establish the Congregation after the Catholic Church was allowed to function again in the nation. They were successful only in 1852, under the leadership of the Abb√© Joseph Gratry, together with the Abb√©s Pierre P√©t√©tot (1801‚Äì1888) and Hyacinthe de Valroger. Gratry was an academic, holding doctorates in both the humanities and theology. He was named the Almoner of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1846, which placed him at the center of intellectual life of the period. He envisioned communities which could be schools of theological exploration, working with the scientific focus of modern society. P√©t√©tot was a pastor in Paris, who saw the clergy of the day as worldly and poorly formed. When they met, they found that they shared a desire for secular priests living in community, without vows. In 1903, forced to leave the country as a result of the anti-clerical laws of the Third French Republic, the Oratorians took refuge in Switzerland, returning to France only in 1920. Current status As of 2019, they numbered 35 members in 13 locations.Oratoire de France Legacy The Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice was founded in 1641 with the purpose of the education of priests, by Jean-Jacques Olier, a disciple of Oratorian Charles de Condren. John Eudes was a member of the Oratory before leaving to establish the Congregation of Jesus and Mary.

While most cases of mycetoma occur in Sudan, Venezuela, Mexico, and India, its true prevalence and incidence are not well-known. It appears most frequently in people living in rural areas, particularly farmers and shepherds. It is listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a neglected tropical disease.  Risk  Frequent exposure to penetrating wounds by thorns or splinters is a risk factor. This risk can be reduced by disinfecting wounds and wearing shoes. Pathogenesis Mycetoma is caused by common saprotrophs found in the soil and on thorny shrubs in semi-desert climates. The most common causative agents are: * Madurella mycetomatis (fungus) * Nocardia brasiliensis (bacteria) * Actinomadure madura (bacteria) * Streptomyces somaliensis (bacteria) * Actinomadura pelletieri (bacteria) Infection is caused as a result of localized skin trauma, such as stepping on a needle or wood splinter, or through a pre-existing wound. The first visible symptom of mycetoma is a typically painless swelling beneath the skin; over several years, this will grow to a nodule (lump). Affected people will experience massive swelling and hardening of the area, in addition to skin rupture and the formation of sinus tracts that discharge pus and grains filled with organisms. In many instances, the underlying bone is affected. Some people with mycetoma will not experience pain or discomfort, while others will report itching and/or pain.  Diagnosis  There are currently no rapid diagnostic tools for mycetoma. Mycetoma is diagnosed through microscopic examination of the grains in the nodule and by analysis of cultures. Since the bacterial form and the fungal form of mycetoma infection of the foot share similar clinical and radiological features, diagnosis can be a challenge. Magnetic resonance imaging is a very valuable diagnostic tool. However, its results should be closely correlated with the clinical, laboratory and pathological findings. Treatment While treatment will vary depending on the cause of the condition, it may include antibiotics or antifungal medication. Actinomycetoma, the bacterial form, can be cured with antibiotics. Eumycetoma, the fungal form, is treated with antifungals. Surgery in the form of bone resection may be necessary in late presenting cases or to enhance the effects of medical treatment. In the more extensive cases amputation is another surgical treatment option. For both forms, extended treatment is necessary. In cats, mycetoma can be treated with complete surgical removal. Antifungal drugs are rarely effective.

As of 2009 it is in the Public Domain and can be streamed on YouTube or downloaded via the Internet Archive. The film tells the story of a young man (Diamond) and his journey to become a US paratrooper. Airborne features training methods used by the US jump school at the time and is an interesting historical document in this respect. Closing credits indicate that the film is dedicated to the veterans of the US 82nd Airborne (All American) Division who established the traditions of the unit in World War II.Mrozek 2000, p. 56. Plot Eddie Slocom (Bobby Diamond) is a young country boy from a farm in Indiana who decides to volunteer to become a paratrooper because of his dreams to be like his uncle Charlie, a paratrooper in World War II. Upon arriving at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he meets a motley crew of volunteers and draftees from varying socio-economic backgrounds with a montage of their basic training shown during the credits. Most notable are Rocky, the bully of the group from Chicago, and Mouse, jive-talking, self- styled \\"lover\\" of the group from the Bronx, who both play important supporting roles in the film. There are also the two sergeants of the platoon, the tough veteran platoon sergeant, Sergeant First Class Benner, and his assistant, the more affable and pleasant but still tough Sgt. White (played by the famous Hollywood stunt man Whitney Hughes). As a wet-behind-the-ears, immature and naive farm-boy and country bumpkin, Eddie is initially mocked by his peers for his wholesome ways and trusting manner, eventually however he earns their respect by his courage, honor, friendliness and his ability to be a good teammate and comrade despite not being the most skilled paratrooper. Drama develops when Eddie meets a doe-eyed country girl by the name of Jenny May and provides a \\"love-interest\\" and a diverting sub-plot to the main theme of the film. Various ups and downs in the life and training of the main protagonist follow. As time goes by all except Rocky cease their teasing of Eddie. Rocky takes Jenny May away from Eddie at a dance on post, later ridicules Eddie's love letters to her and physically threatens not only Eddie but the other members of the group. When Rocky is overheard ridiculing people from farms and members of the 4-H Club, SFC Benner stands in Rocky's face and loudly reminds him that he too is a farmer and asks him if he would like to repeat his comments to his face but Rocky backs down. He instructs Slocum to recite the values of the 4-H that he advises the men to follow. To further demonstrate that being a paratrooper is more than jumping out of an aircraft, he orders the group to a guided tour of the Division's museum where all but Rocky are impressed by the courage of the Division in two world wars, including an account of another country bumpkin Sgt. Alvin York. The climax of the training is the platoon's first jump. Rocky collides into Eddie and Rocky's chute collapses. The small Eddie is able to grab Rocky's collapsed parachute and holds it allowing Rocky to land safely. Not only is Rocky shocked by Eddie's courage and strength but also the group of friends he has bullied eagerly run to him to see if he is safe. People sincerely caring about him is something that has never happened to Rocky before. All of the group become buddies and proud members of the US 82nd Airborne Division.

Wente had conjectured that Henuttawy was the daughter of Smendes and Queen Tentamun , the wife of Pinudjem I and the mother of King Psusennes and his wife, Mutnodjmet, The High Priest of Amun Menkheperre, the Generalissimo of the South and North, Menkheperre, and God's Wife of Amun Maatkare. Kenneth Kitchen had conjectured there were two women called Henuttawy during the period to explain some of the titles associated with the name Henuttawy. Wente had shown that Henuttawy was the wife of Pinedjem I, the Theban High Priest of Amun who was de facto ruler of Upper Egypt and took on pharaonic titles later on.Andrzej Niwi≈Ñski, \\"Problems in the Chronology and Genealogy of the XXIst Dynasty: New Proposals for their Interpretation\\", Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Vol. 16 (1979), pp. 49-68M. L. Bierbrier, \\"Hrere, Wife of the High Priest Paiankh\\", Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 32, No. 3 (Jul., 1973), p. 311 The titles attested for Henuttawy helps us identify which of Pinedjem's children were hers: Psusennes I, who went on to become pharaoh in Tanis; his wife Mutnedjmet; and Maatkare, who became God's Wife of Amun. It is likely she was also the mother of Henuttawy who is depicted along with Maatkare and Mutnedjmet in Karnak.Dodson & Hilton, p.201 It is more difficult to identify the high priest referred to in her titles: three of Pinedjem's sons, Masaharta, Djedkhonsuefankh and Menkheperre became high priests, and one, two, or all three of them could have been Duathathor- Henuttawy's son.Dodson & Hilton, p.202 Niwi≈Ñski conjectured that Henuttawy was the daughter of Ramesses XI and Tentamun. Dodson recognizes two queens named Tentamun. One is the wife of Ramesses Xi and the mother of Henuttawy. This Queen is mentioned in the funerary papyrus of Queen Hennutawy. Another Queen named Tentamun was presumably a daughter of Ramesses XI and possibly a full sister of Henuttawy, and she was married to Smendes. The latter Tentamun is mentioned in the Story of Wenamun.Dodson & Hilton, p.194 She is mentioned before her husband's ascendence to the throne on a chalice found in Tanis, on a door lintel and on a relief in the Khonsu temple in the Karnak temple complex. Even here she is mentioned as a queen, with her name written in a cartouche. Later she is also mentioned on a stela in Coptos, in Mut's temple in Karnak and on several objects found in her son's tomb in Tanis. She is depicted on the facade of the Khonsu temple in Karnak.Dodson & Hilton, p.206 Death and burial Mummy of Henuttawy prior to restoration Her mummy and coffins were found in the DB320 cache along with those of several members of her immediate family. She was buried elsewhere before being moved to the cache, but the original place of burial is not known. Henuttawy's mummy was found in a set of two wooden coffins. The coffins must have been covered in gold, but all of the gold had been adzed off. They are now in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo. The mummy was damaged by tomb robbers. In the search for the heart scarab the main part of the chest area had been penetrated. Packing linen under a subject's skin had become common practice in 20th Dynasty mummification, but had caused the flesh on the face of Lady Henuttawy to burst open. The face was restored after discovery. Auguste Mariette purchased two large funerary papyrus rolls that are thought to have belonged to Queen Henuttawy.

It requires Department of Homeland Security to coordinate with other Federal agencies and with State, local, and Tribal governments to develop a National Preparedness Goal with Emergency management. Congressional laws enacted, following the wake of 9/11, which resulted in new developments in the way security was assessed and addressed in the United States, to prevent and respond to threatened or actual domestic terrorist attacks, disasters, and other emergencies by requiring a national domestic all-hazards preparedness goal. HSPD 5, HSPD-7, HSPD-8, and HSPD-8 Annex 1 are directives that deal with the preparedness goals. HSPD-8 The goal of HSPD-8, is the coordination and implementation of all-hazards preparedness in the United States, to help ensure the preparedness of the Nation to prevent, respond to, and recover from threatened and actual domestic terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. The goal is to be attained by: *a. Providing for the effective, efficient, and timely delivery of federal preparedness assistance to state and local governments; and *b. Supporting efforts to ensure First responders are prepared to respond to major events, especially prevention of and response to threatened terrorist attacks. First responders can be civilians that are members of a United States national service program under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security, The National Office of Citizen Corp's (FEMA) Individual and Community Preparedness Division, Community emergency response team (CERT)  Annex I  HSPD-8, Annex I, National Planning; describes a common Federal planning process that supports development of a family of related planning documents, known as the Integrated Planning System (IPS). The IPS concept provides the federal government with a consistent direction and delineation of authorities, responsibilities and requirements, common terms of reference, and plans based on shared assumptions. History The domestic incident management plan is provided for from presidential directives HSPD-5HSPD 5 issued February 28, 2003, HSPD-7, HSPD-8,HSPD 8 and HSPD-8 Annex 1,HSPD 8 Annex 1 as a result of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. These directives set up the laws and regulations for managing domestic incidents by establishing the, comprehensive National Incident Management System (NIMS), and the National Response Framework (NRF). Both of these plans are augmented by the National Integration Center (NIC) and describes the way Federal departments and agencies will prepare for such a response, including prevention activities during the early stages of a terrorism incident. National Security Presidential Directive 51, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20 (NSPD-51/HSPD-20), and the National Continuity Policy, dated May 4, 2007, outline the continuity requirements for all Federal departments and agencies, with guidance for non-Federal organizations. These requirements include such things as essential functions, orders of succession, delegations of authority, continuity of operations, continuity of communications, vital records, and human capital. All of these rules and regulations for a national defense against any possible threat of national attack. HSPD-8 Annex 1 resulted in the Integrated Planning System (IPS) by using the Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101 (CPG). 9/11 The attacks of September 11, 2001, brought about many changes in the country. An attack such as this had never before happened and steps had to be taken to ensure it didn't again. Around the world Many nations were affected by the attacks. Over 3000 lost their lives from the world including Australia, Bermuda, Canada, China, El Salvador, Germany, Grenada, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States, and 30 that were listed as UNKNOWN.CNN In the U.S. Congress was swift to react and enacted laws to protect the United States with the Patriot Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001, and the Homeland Security Act of 2002 enacted November 25, 2002, as well as other laws for the protection of the country.

Existing White House defense and foreign policies will be under fire, such as a withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as nuclear reduction attempts. The end result will be strengthened Homeland Security enforcement in anticipation of any possible retaliations from the Taliban or Al Qaida.

Biography Early years Maurice Becker was born in Nizhni- Novgorod, Russia, the son of ethnic Jewish parents. The family emigrated from Russia to the United States in 1892, moving to the Jewish community of the Lower East Side of New York City. His older sister was Helen Tamiris a modern dance pioneer and his brother Sam Becker was a sculptor. The young Maurice took night classes in bookkeeping and art while working days as a sign painter.Rebecca Zurier, Art for the Masses: A Radical Magazine and Its Graphics, 1911‚Äì1917. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1988. Page 175. He worked as an artist for the New York Tribune from 1914 to 1915, and for the Scripps newspapers from 1915 to 1918. He also contribute artwork on a freelance basis to a broad range of contemporary publications, including Harper's Weekly, Metropolitan magazine, and The Saturday Evening Post.Zurier, Art for the Masses, pg. 176. Radical art Becker cartoon published in The Masses, March 1913. Ammunition (1914) by Maurice Becker, Maurice Becker is best remembered as an illustrator for radical magazines, most famously for the New York political and artistic magazine The Masses, to which he began to contribute in 1912. He married Dorothy Baldwin, an active Socialist, in 1918. That same year he became a conscientious objector to American participation in World War I. He fled to Mexico to avoid the draft.Zurier, Art for the Masses, pg. 176. He was arrested upon his return to the United States in 1919 and was tried, convicted, and sentenced to 25 years of hard labor, of which he served 4 months at Fort Leavenworth prior to commutation of his sentence.Zurier, Art for the Masses, pg. 176. Becker was a frequent contributor to the radical press, publishing his art in such periodicals as Revolt, The Toiler, New Solidarity, The Blast, Survey Graphic, The New York Call. and The New Masses. Becker's work, which often made use of the muted tones of graphite or charcoal, was likewise generally softer in political tone than the more hard- edged and biting work of his peers, who included Art Young, Fred Ellis, Robert Minor, Hugo Gellert, and William Gropper. From 1921 to 1923, Becker lived in Mexico, where he worked as an artist for El Pulsa de M√©xico, an English- language magazine. After that time, he dedicated himself to painting full- time, essentially ending his career as a political artist for magazines. He did occasionally contribute art to political publications after that date, however, such as an apolitical drawing entitled \\"Summer,\\" which ran in the August 1926 issue of The New Masses. Becker remained a political radical throughout his life and was either a member or a fellow traveler of the Communist Party USA for many years. He visited the Soviet Union in 1931. In 1932 Becker Joined The League of Professional Groups for Foster and Ford, officially endorsing Communist candidate William Z. Foster for President of the United States.Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX, pg. 1000. In 1936 he likewise endorsed Communist candidate Earl Browder as a member of the Committee of Professional Groups for Browder and Ford.HUAC, Appendix ‚Äì Part IX, pg. 641. His name appeared on the letterhead of the Artists' Front to Win the War, a mass organization closely linked to the Communist Party, and he was a signatory to the call for formation of the American Artists' Congress, a party-backed initiative.HUAC, Appendix ‚Äì Part IX, pp. 574, 1075.

Jos√© de los Reyes Berreyesa Jos√© de los Reyes Berrelleza (also spelled Berreyesa) was born at Mission Santa Clara on January 6, 1785, the third child and first son in the family. He served as an army sergeant at El Presidio Real de San Francisco. In 1805, he married Mar√≠a Zacar√≠as Bernal at Mission Santa Clara. The couple had 13 children during 1807‚Äì1833, with 10 living past infancy. They moved in 1834 to hold land in Almaden Valley. In 1842, Jos√© de los Reyes Berreyesa received from Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado a grant giving him one square league, or , of the land he had been cultivating, called Rancho San Vicente, near the Santa Teresa Hills and at the south end of Almaden Valley. The grant included a large section of the rocky hills upon which a rich source of mercury-carrying cinnabar ore was found in 1844‚Äì1845, and the discovery was made public. Mercury was an important part of gold- and silver-mining operations, and was in demand the world over, and especially in the California gold fields after 1848. The neighboring grant, Rancho Ca√±ada de los Capitancillos, was now held by Andr√©s Castillero, who claimed the mercury mine was part of his land. Robert Walkinshaw and some other men squatted on the land in February 1845 and began to take lumber and limestone away for sale in August.The United States vs. Andres Castillero: \\"New Almaden\\" : transcript of the record, Volume 1. United States District Court, California, Northern District. 1859. The New Almaden mercury mine began producing a small amount of rich ore in 1846. In 1846, during the Bear Flag Revolt, three of the sons of Jos√© de los Reyes Berreyesa were imprisoned by John C. Fr√©mont in Sonoma, California, where one of the sons, Jos√© de los Santos Berreyesa, had been serving as Alcalde. Accompanied by two cousins, twin sons of Francisco de Haro, the 61-year-old father went to see how his sons were being treated in prison. After they landed their boat in San Rafael, the three men were shot and killed by three of Fr√©mont's men, including Kit Carson, and they were stripped of their belongings. When asked by prisoner Jos√© de los Santos Berreyesa whether their father had been killed, Fr√©mont said it might have been a man named Castro. A soldier of Fr√©mont's was seen wearing the elder Berreyesa's serape, and Fr√©mont refused to assist Jos√© de los Santos Berreyesa in retrieving it as a final token of their father to give to their mother. The three brothers resorted to buying the serape from the soldier for the extortionate price of $25 ($ today.)Eldredge, Zoeth Skinner. The Beginnings of San Francisco, 1912. \\"Appendix D: The Murder of Berreyesa and the De Haros.\\" Hosted at SFGenealogy. Retrieved on August 16, 2009. Later, Carson told Jasper O'Farrell that he regretted killing the Californios, but that the act was only one such that Fr√©mont ordered him to commit. The New Almaden mine was taken in possession by Robert Walkinshaw of the New Almaden Mining Company in April 1847 by means of a forged grant document supposedly bearing the signature of the alcalde of Presidio San Jos√©, Jos√© Dolores Pacheco, who always signed documents \\"Dolores Pacheco\\"‚Äîthe questionable document was signed only \\"Pacheco\\", and in a finer hand than his. Three of the Berreyesa sons battled with the squatters, trying to dislodge them from the mining works. Their mother, the widow Mar√≠a Zacar√≠as Bernal de Berreyesa, fought for the land by filing suit in court against the New Almaden Mining Company. Castillero filed suit to prove his claim on the mine, and the United States worked to prove the mining land was public, not part of any grant, so that the government could seize the mine. The case dragged on for years as witnesses were called from Mexico. In July 1854, her ninth son, Jos√© de la Encarnaci√≥n Ram√≥n Antonio Berreyesa, was grabbed by a posse, tied with rope around the neck and questioned, but was set free. Several days later, her fifth son, Joseph Zenobia Nemesio Berreyesa, was guarding the New Almaden mine at night when he was seized by masked men and hanged. In 1856, men broke into the home of her seventh son, Francisco Antonio Berreyesa, and killed him. Aftering leaving for the relative safety of Ventura, Jos√© de la Encarnaci√≥n Ram√≥n Antonio Berreyesa was caught on February 5, 1857 by a band of vigilantes that had been told he consorted with the bandit Juan Flores. The vigilantes, a group called the El Monte Rangers who were frustrated at the recent escape of Flores, saw the rope scars around Berreyesa's neck and assumed he had somehow foiled a prior attempt at execution, so they hanged him until dead.Gonzalez-Day, Ken. Lynching in the West, 1850‚Äì1935, Duke University Press, 2006, pp. 4‚Äì5, 191, 239. An 1863 court decision in the Berreyesa's favor allowed them to sell the rights to work the mine for $1,700,000 in 1864. Eventually, the United States was able to prove that the two adjoining land grants did not include the rocky hills and the mine, and the mining operation was nationalized.Beale, Howard K. The Diary of Edward Bates 1859‚Äì1866, Read Books, 2008, pp. 49, 65‚Äì69, 282, 304, 339‚Äì342. The Berreyesa family was finally rewarded on June 24, 1868 with a patent issued by the United States Supreme Court stating that the arable land of the rancho was theirs, but not the rocky hills containing the mines.UC Berkeley.

History of California, 1884. Nazario Antonio Berrelleza Nazario Antonio Berrelleza (also spelled Nasario Berreyesa, nicknamed Jos√©) was born at Mission Santa Clara on July 28, 1787, the fourth child and second son in the family. He served as an army corporal at Presidio San Francisco, 1819‚Äì1824. As payment for his government service, he accepted a grant of land contained in a river valley east of Napa, California, called Rancho Las Putas, named for Putah Creek which ran through it. Nazario raised 5,000 cattle, 20,000 horses and grew grain crops throughout the fertile valley that became known as Berryessa Valley. The livestock holdings extended northward over some rocky hills to a neighboring valley, Rancho Ca√±ada de Capay, ranched by Berreyesa cousins. Nicol√°s Antonio Berreyesa II Nicol√°s Tolentino Antonio Berrelleza (also known as Nicol√°s Antonio Berreyesa II) was born at Mission Santa Clara on July 12, 1789, the fifth child and third son in the family. He served as a leather-armored soldier (soldado de cuera) at Presidio San Francisco, and married Mar√≠a de Gracia Padilla in 1811 at Mission Dolores. In 1834, he was granted Rancho Milpitas, an area equal to one square league, or , by the alcalde of San Jos√©, Pedro Chaboya. The governor of Alta California, Jos√© Castro, granted a neighboring tract to Jos√© Mar√≠a Alviso sixteen months later, in 1835. In 1852, Anglo squatters were living on the Alviso and Berreyesa grants in numbers too great for the Californios to eject. A man named James Jake described to Nicol√°s Antonio Berreyesa a scheme wherein Berreyesa and three of his sons would emulate the squatters and mark out four new plots to build dwellings and establish their claim on the land. Jake quickly moved into the empty Berreyesa adobe and claimed the whole grant. Berreyesa lost $500 in paying for a failed court battle to regain his rancho.Pitt, 1966, p. 101. Another Anglo settler laid out Alviso's claim using measurements that included a sizable piece of the Berreyesa claim, including crops and buildings. Berreyesa sued, but his lawyers dropped out of sight while supposedly covering his case in Washington, D.C., losing irreplaceable documents. Berreyesa burned the rest of his real estate documents in a mad rage.Pitt, 1966, p. 102. The Alviso claim won out in 1871. Nicol√°s Antonio Berreyesa died in 1873.

He played in an NCAA national championship game and in Major League Baseball the same year. Bouldin was listed as and ; in baseball, he was a switch hitter who threw right-handed. Early life Bouldin was born in Germantown, Kentucky and grew up in Norwood, Ohio in Greater Cincinnati. He attended Norwood High School and played basketball for coach Dick Dallmer, who was an All-American at the University of Cincinnati, and baseball, graduating in 1957. He is Norwood's all-time leading scorer in basketball. College basketball career Bouldin attended the University of Cincinnati, where he excelled in both basketball and baseball. In basketball, as a sophomore in 1958‚Äì59, with the Bearcats led by coach George Smith and future Hall-of-Famer Oscar Robertson and his 32.6 points per game, Bouldin averaged 2.3 points and 1.0 rebound per game as a backup to starting guards Mike Mendenhall and Ralph Davis, who averaged 13.5 and 15.5 points, respectively.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/cinn/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/1011UCMBKMEDIASUP.pdf The Bearcats posted a 26-4 record and won the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) championship, and advanced to the NCAA Final Four, where they finished in third place nationally. As a junior in 1959‚Äì60, Bouldin became a starting guard alongside Davis, with Bouldin averaging 5.8 points and 1.8 rebounds per game, with the team again led by Robertson and joined by new center Paul Hogue. The Bearcats went 28-2, won the MVC title and again advanced to the NCAA Final Four, where once again they had to settle for third place. By Bouldin's senior season of 1960‚Äì61, with Robertson graduated and new coach Ed Jucker leading the Bearcats, Bouldin was team co-captain with Bob Wiesenhahn, who both started along with Hogue and newcomers forward Tom Thacker and guard Tony Yates to form an athletic, physical, balanced attack. Bouldin averaged 11.7 points and 2.8 rebounds and led the team with an .800 free throw percentage. The Bearcats posted a 27-3 record, successfully defended their MVC title, and for the third consecutive season advanced to the NCAA Final Four. This time, however, the results were different. In the national semifinal game, Bouldin poured in a team-high 21 points as the Bearcats defeated Utah, 82-67. Then, he scored 16 points as the Bearcats defeated Ohio State in the NCAA championship game 70-65 in overtime to win their first national championship. College baseball career In baseball, Bouldin was a pitcher as the baseball team was also coached by Ed Jucker. Bouldin set or tied several records‚Äîhis 2.38 earned run average (ERA) still ranks sixth in UC history, and his .206 opponent batting average ranks third.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/cinn/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/2010BaseballMediaGuide.pdf For a single season, his 1.41 ERA in 1959 ranks third all-time, and his .186 opponent batting average that season ranks seventh. The Bearcats posted winning records every season Bouldin played, including his senior season of 1961 under new coach Glenn Sample when the Bearcats went 19-5-2 and won the Missouri Valley Conference title. Professional baseball career Bouldin was selected in the 14th round of the 1961 NBA draft by the Cincinnati Royals, but the two-sport college star decided the professional baseball was the best option. He signed with the Washington Senators. He began the 1961 season in the short-season Appalachian League with the Middleboro Senators, and later that season pitched for the Alabama‚ÄìFlorida League Pensacola Senators. During the season, he was called up to the Major League Washington Senators, and made his first MLB appearance on September 2, 1961, allowing one run in two innings in a 13-7 loss to the Chicago White Sox. He appeared in one more game, which he started and gave up five runs in just 1.1 innings, taking the loss against the Baltimore Orioles. However, his minor league season was more successful as, between Middlesboro and Pensacola, he compiled a 9-5 record with a 2.97 ERA. In the 1962 season, Bouldin played most of the season in the minors with the Class AAA Syracuse Chiefs of the International League, but he did pitch in six games in the major leagues for the Senators, going 1-2 with a 5.85 ERA. In 1963, he pitched most of the season with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. But he again saw major league action with the Senators, posting a 2-2 record with a 5.79 ERA. The 1964 season was his fourth and final in the big leagues, as he pitched nine games for the Senators, going 0-3 with a 5.40 ERA. He played most of the season in the minors, first for Toronto and then for the Indianapolis Indians, the Pacific Coast League affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. In 1965 he pitched again for Indianapolis; it was the final season of his professional baseball career. Personal life Bouldin is retired and resides in Newport, Kentucky with his wife, Ann. In 1982, he was inducted into the University of Cincinnati Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1992, he was an inaugural inductee into the Norwood High School Athletic Hall of Fame.

In June 2009, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley told reporters, \\"if it‚Äôs all done entirely within the private sector, you know, it doesn‚Äôt seem to me it‚Äôs got the faults that you have... by having the government institute something.\\" Steven Hill, a program director at the New America Foundation, has written for Salon.com that \\"co-ops may hold the key to a substantive compromise\\", comparing the U.S. reform proposals with health care in Germany. He argued that they can produce quality care for less money given that they would lack the profit motive, they would negotiate fees for service, and that they would end current market monopolies that insurance companies have in several states. Criticism Howard Dean and other Democrats have criticized abandoning the idea of a federally run, statewide, public option in favor of co-ops, questioning whether the co-ops would have enough negotiating power to compete with private health insurers. The activist groups SEIU and MoveOn.org have also stated their opposition. 2008 Nobel Economics Laureate Paul Krugman and political commentator Robert Reich have also questioned co-ops' ability to become large enough to reduce health care costs significantly. Thus, they both support the public option instead, which they state has strong opposition from the insurance industry.

Commissioned by the Kinsman Transit Co. of Cleveland, Ohio she was launched as hull number 14 by Jenks Ship Building Co. of Port Huron, Michigan. Her design featured a forward forecastle containing crew cabins topped with an additional cabin and pilot house. The mid section was a long nearly flat deck over the cargo holds only interrupted by 12 hatches fitted with telescoping type hatch covers. The aft end featured a large cabin situated over the engine room containing the galley, mess rooms, and crew quarters and was topped with a smoke stack and air vents. The Steinbrenner later featured a \\"doghouse\\" cabin aft of her smoke stack to house added crew from a change in the crew watch system on the Great Lakes. Career The Steinbrenner had an eventful first two decades on the Great Lakes. On December 6, 1909 the Steinbrenner was downbound loaded with iron ore when she was involved in a collision on St. Marys River with the nearly new . The Steinbrenner sank in the river and was declared a total constructive loss, but was recovered on May 10, 1910, repaired and returned to service. She would resume a rather uneventful pattern of trading until she once again collided with another ship. This time she struck the in a foggy Whitefish Bay but managed to stay afloat. After $5000 in repairs, she once again resumed trading. Final voyage At 5:11 AM on May 10, 1953, the 52-year-old ship left Superior, Wisconsin, with nearly 7000 tons of iron ore for the steel mills on Lake Erie. Weather conditions were good at the time but forecasts called for rougher weather later in the day. Leaving despite unfavorable forecasts wasn't rare for captains of this time. Weather reports were less accurate than modern forecasts and most captains and crews had endured several storms during their careers. Later that afternoon the Steinbrenner met with the forecast gale as strong winds and large waves buffeted the vessel. Although he secured his ship's deck, Captain Albert Stiglin did not have his crew place tarpaulins on the twelve leaf-type \\"Telescoping\\" hatch covers; since these were not watertight, they allowed some water to seep into the cargo holds. Around 8 pm one of the leaves on the number 11 hatch worked loose and allowed water to pour into the hold. Crew members were dispatched to secure the cover but, as the storm intensified, 80 mph winds and large waves worked the leaf loose again. Complicating the issue, doors and vents were being forced open by the storm. Conditions were now too treacherous to send crews out on deck. Pumps were started but the flooding continued. Captain Stiglin tried to keep the waves from causing more damage but by morning other hatch covers had worked loose and the ship staggered to make headway. After a few more maneuvers it became all too apparent that the ship was doomed. Shortly after 7:00 AM on May 11, 1953, an SOS was broadcast. At 7:35 AM, an abandon ship signal was blown on the whistle and the crew mustered at the forward life raft, and the aft lifeboats. As the ship settled in the water, confusion took hold and several men ended up in the water or were injured. The vessel sank quickly fifteen miles south of Isle Royale Light. Alerted by the SOS, the steamers Wilfred Sykes, Joseph H. Thompson (then the largest ship on the lakes), D.M. Clemson, D.G. Kerr, William E. Corey, and the Canadian ship Hochelaga, conducted a search for survivors. The Joseph H. Thompson, under the command of Captain Robert F. Leng, found the life raft and 6 men taking refuge in it. The D.M. Clemson, under the command of Captain Arthur M. Everett, found one life boat. In heavy winds and rough seas, Captain Everett carefully maneuvered the Clemson to put the lifeboat in the ship's lee and then had the survivors lifted aboard with ropes. The men were then taken to the Captain's quarters where they were given warm food and dry clothes. The Wilfred Sykes rescued the men of the other life boat. Aftermath In the end, 17 men were lost in the tragedy. Fingers were pointed at the crew for not using the tarpaulins on the hatches, but in a storm of that magnitude even the tarpaulins may not have been enough to keep the Henry Steinbrenner afloat. The loss of the Steinbrenner solidified the move by Great Lakes vessel operators to equip some of their older vessels with watertight single piece hatch covers during rebuilds. Examples of ships that saw this work included the SS L.E. Block, SS Willis B Boyer, and the SS George W. Perkins.

Headquartered at Scranton for the duration of its existence, the regiment was formed as the Scranton City Guards Battalion of the Pennsylvania National Guard in 1877, and expanded into the 13th Infantry Regiment, Pennsylvania National Guard a year later. It was called up for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War as the 13th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment, but did not serve overseas, and again to guard the Mexican border in 1916. The 13th combined with another Pennsylvania regiment to form the new 109th Infantry in 1917 for service in World War I with the 28th Division. Demobilized after the end of World War I, the 13th Infantry was briefly reorganized in the Pennsylvania National Guard before regaining its World War I designation in 1921, part of the reorganized 28th Division. As a result of World War II, it was again mobilized with the division in early 1941. After the end of the war, the 109th was reorganized at Scranton in 1946, being called up as a result of the Korean War to replace Regular Army units sent to Korea. History  Origins  The 109th was organized on 14 August 1877 as the Scranton City Guards Battalion, a unit of the Pennsylvania National Guard based at Scranton. On 23 September 1878, it was expanded, reorganized, and redesignated to become the 13th Infantry Regiment. By 1898, it included eight companies: A, B, C, D, F, and H at Scranton, E at Honesdale, and G at Montrose. The regiment formed part of the Third Brigade of the Pennsylvania National Guard division. In response to President William McKinley's proclamation calling for volunteers to serve in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the regiment encamped at Mount Gretna on 28 April, where it joined the rest of the Pennsylvania National Guard to be mustered into Federal service. At Mount Gretna, it accepted recruits to increase the strength of each company to three officers and 75 men. All companies except for Company A and the regimental headquarters were mustered into Federal service on 12 May, followed by the latter on the next day. In Federal service, the regiment was designated the 13th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The 13th Pennsylvania departed Mount Gretna for Camp Alger in northern Virginia on 19 May and arrived there the next day. There, it was assigned to the Third Brigade of the First Division of the Second Army Corps, along with the 8th and 12th Pennsylvania. Colonel Henry A. Coursen, the 13th Pennsylvania regimental commander, temporarily served as brigade commander until 25 June. Meanwhile, on 1 June, the regiment expanded the enlisted strength of each company to 106 men through recruiting. The regiment moved its camp from Camp Alger to a location near Dunn Loring station on 19 July, then relocated to Camp George G. Meade in Pennsylvania on 31 August. While stationed at the latter, the regiment participated in the 27 October Philadelphia Peace Jubilee celebration to commemorate the cessation of hostilities. The 13th Pennsylvania again relocated to Camp MacKenzie near Augusta, Georgia, on 14 November, where it was mustered out of Federal service on 11 March 1899. After mustering out, the regiment returned to Scranton two days later via Washington, D.C., and Harrisburg. The 13th was reorganized in northeastern Pennsylvania between 21 June and 20 August of that year. For service on the Mexican border, it was mustered into Federal service on 26 September 1916 at Mount Gretna. Returning from the border, the regiment was drafted into Federal service on 5 August 1917 after American entry into World War I. It was consolidated with the 1st Infantry Regiment of the Pennsylvania National Guard on 11 October 1917 to become the 109th Infantry of the 28th Division.  World War I  In the First World War, the regiment arrived in France in May, 1918, and was engaged in combat during the Second Battle of the Marne (14‚Äì18 July 1918) in the vicinity of Bois le Rois commune, in the Seine et Marne department, as well as during the Meuse-Argonne offensive, the principal engagement of the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I, from September until the end of the war on 11 November 1918. Returning to the Port of New York aboard the USS Maui on 3 May 1919, it was demobilized at Camp Dix, New Jersey between 17 and 20 May.  Between the wars  The former 13th Infantry Regiment was reorganized between 1919 and 1920 as a Pennsylvania National Guard unit in northeastern Pennsylvania designated the 13th Infantry. It was redesignated as the 109th Infantry on 1 April 1921, joining the reorganized 28th Division as part of its 55th Infantry Brigade. Its headquarters was Federally recognized at Wilkes-Barre on 20 December of that year. The regimental headquarters relocated to Scranton in 1923. The regiment participated in summer training at Mount Gretna between 1921 and 1934. It participated in the Third Corps Area concentration of the First Army maneuver, held from 10 August to 3 September 1935 at Indiantown Gap and Mount Gretna, which involved 20,000 troops, mostly from the 28th and 29th Divisions. It was called up for relief duty in western Pennsylvania between 17 March and 9 April 1936 after the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers flooded, along with the rest of the division. Summer training was moved to Indiantown Gap between 1936 and 1938. Between 5 and 19 August 1939, the regiment participated in the Third Corps Area concentration of the First Army maneuvers at Manassas, involving 24,700 troops, mostly from the 28th and 29th Divisions. With the division, the 109th participated in the First Army maneuvers in western New York between 4 and 25 August 1940, which involved 81,000 troops from the entire army.  World War II  As a result of World War II, the 109th was mobilized with the rest of the National Guard and inducted into Federal service at Scranton on 17 February 1941. It assembled with the division at Indiantown Gap, arriving there on 1 March. The regiment absorbed 194 draftees, mostly from New York and New Jersey with a small number of Southerners, in June. With the division, it participated in the Carolina Maneuvers between 6 October and 1 November. The 28th Division was redesignated as the 28th Infantry Division on 17 February 1942. During its participation in the European Theater of Operations in the Second World War, the 109th Regiment served across France and through the Hurtgen Forest of Germany; elements of the Regiment led the Division into the Rhineland to become the first troops to invade German soil since Napoleon. The 109th Infantry won battle honors at Normandy, Northern France, Ardennes-Alsace, the Rhineland and Central Europe and they were honored with the Luxemburg Croix de Guerre and the French Croix de Guerre for action at the Colmar Pocket. Eddie Slovik, a member of this regiment was the only American soldier executed for desertion in the 20th century. After the end of the war, it was inactivated at Camp Shelby, Mississippi on 22 October 1945.  Cold War  The 109th Infantry Regiment was reorganized and Federally recognized with headquarters at Scranton on 16 December 1946. It was ordered into active Federal service 5 September 1950 to replace Regular Army units fighting in the Korean War. While the 109th was on active duty, a replacement 109th Infantry was organized and Federally recognized on 6 July 1953 with headquarters at Scranton as a unit of the National Guard of the United States (NGUS). The 109th was released from active Federal service on 15 June 1954 and reverted to state control, with the NGUS 109th simultaneously dissolving. The infantry regiment was deemed too unwieldy for the Cold War battlefield by the United States Army, and the regiment was reorganized as a parent regiment of the Combat Arms Regimental System on 1 June 1959, eliminating the regimental headquarters. Under the Pentomic reorganization of the army, the 1st Battle Group, 109th Infantry remained as part of the 28th Infantry Division. Before the reorganization, the regiment included about 1,800 personnel, reduced to 914 after conversion to the 1st Battle Group (BG). The Headquarters and Headquarters Companies (HHC) of the regiment and the 1st Battalion and the Medical and Service Companies at Scranton were combined to form the HHC of the 1st BG. The Heavy Mortar Company of the 109th at Scranton and West Pittston became the Combat Support Company of the 1st BG. Companies F and G of the 109th combined to form Company A of the 1st BG at East Stroudsburg. Companies B and E of the 109th at Scranton and Carbondale, respectively, retained their letters with the 1st BG, while Companies A and C of the 109th became Company C of the 1st BG at Scranton, and the 2nd Battalion HHC and Company H of the 109th became Company D of the 1st BG at Carbondale and Honesdale. The 3rd Battalion, 109th Infantry at Milton, Berwick, and Williamsport became the 154th Transportation Battalion. Company D of the 109th at Plymouth became Company D of the 165th Military Police Battalion, while the Tank Company of the 109th at Nanticoke became Battery B (155mm), 2nd Howitzer Battalion, 109th Field Artillery. As a result of the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan, battle groups were replaced by battalions and on 1 April 1963 the 1st Battle Group became the 1st Battalion, 109th Infantry (1-109th Infantry) and the 2nd Battalion, 109th Infantry was activated; both battalions were part of the 28th. A 3rd Battalion was activated on 24 March 1964 as a non-divisional unit, but was eliminated on 17 February 1968. The 3rd Battalion was reactivated as a 28th Division unit on 1 April 1975. The 109th was reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System on 5 April 1988.  1990s and 21st century  The 2nd Battalion was converted into the 2nd Battalion, 103rd Armor on 1 March 1992, and the 3rd Battalion similarly became the 3rd Battalion, 103rd Armor on 1 October 1995, leaving only the 1-109th Infantry. The 1-109th was ordered into active Federal service between 28 and 31 May 2002 for duty in Bosnia with the Stabilisation Force, along with the 28th Infantry Division headquarters, the 104th Infantry Detachment, and 1st Squadron, 104th Cavalry. After two months of training at Indiantown Gap, the units conducted additional training at Fort Dix and Hohenfels before arriving in Bosnia at the end of August to take over responsibility for Multi-National Division (North). The 1-109th returned to Pennsylvania in March 2003, and was released from active Federal service on 20 May, reverting to state control. Soldiers of Company B of the 1-109th on foot patrol in a village near FOB Diamond near Ramadi, March 2006 The 1-109th was ordered into active Federal service on 22 January 2005 for a deployment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom with the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 28th Infantry Division, then the largest Pennsylvania National Guard combat deployment since World War II. Five soldiers of Company B were killed in Ramadi on 28 September when their M2A2 Bradley detonated an IED while providing security for the building of a railway bridge and was set on fire by rocket-propelled grenades and small-arms fire. On 1 October, the army officially reintroduced the designation of regiment to parent regiments, with the 109th Infantry becoming the 109th Infantry Regiment. Returning to the United States after a year in Iraq with the brigade, the 1-109th was released from active Federal service on 20 July 2006, reverting to state control. As a result of the creation of modular combat brigades by the reorganization plan of United States Army, the 1-109th was assigned to the 55th Brigade Combat Team, 28th Infantry Division on 1 September 2007. The battalion was ordered into active Federal service on 6 October 2012 for a deployment to Kuwait, in which it provided security at Camp Buehring. Returning to the United States after eight months there, the 1-109th was released from active Federal service on 25 November 2013, reverting to state control.

The Notch extracellular domain (NECD) mediates interactions with DSL family ligands, allowing it to participate in juxtacrine signaling.The Notch intracellular domain (NICD) acts as a transcriptional activator when in complex with CSL family transcription factors. Members of this Type 1 transmembrane protein family share several core structures, including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and an intracellular domain transcriptional activation domain (TAD). Notch family members operate in a variety of different tissues and play a role in a variety of developmental processes by controlling cell fate decisions. Much of what is known about Notch function comes from studies done in Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans) and Drosophila melanogaster. Human homologs have also been identified, but details of Notch function and interactions with its ligands are not well known in this context.  Discovery  Notch was discovered in a mutant Drosophila in March 1913 in the lab of Thomas Hunt Morgan. This mutant emerged after several generations of crossing out and back-crossing beaded winged flies with wild type flies and was first characterized by John S. Dexter. The most frequently observed phenotype in Notch mutant flies is the appearance of a concave serration at the most distal end of the wings, for which the gene is named, accompanied by the absence of marginal bristles. This mutant was found to be a sex-linked dominant on the X chromosome that could only be observed in heterozygous females as it was lethal in males and homozygous females. The first Notch allele was established in 1917 by C.W. Metz and C.B. Bridges. In the late 1930s, studies of fly embryogenesis done by Donald F. Poulson provided the first indication of Notch's role in development. Notch-8 mutant males exhibited a lack of the inner germ layers, the endoderm and mesoderm, that resulted in failure to undergo later morphogenesis embryonic lethality. Later studies in early Drosophila neurogenesis provided some of the first indications of Notch's roll in cell-cell signaling, as the nervous system in Notch mutants was developed by sacrificing hypodermal cells. Starting in the 1980s researchers began to gain further insights into Notch function through genetic and molecular experiments. Genetic screens conducted in Drosophila led to the identification of several proteins that play a central role in Notch signaling, including Enhancer of split, Master mind, Delta, Suppressor of Hairless (CSL), and Serrate. At the same time, the Notch gene was successfully sequenced and cloned, providing insights into the molecular architecture of Notch proteins and led to identification of Notch homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and eventually in mammals. In the early 1990s Notch was increasingly implicated as the receptor of a previously unknown intercellular signal pathway in which the NICD is transported to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor to directly regulate target genes. The release of the NICD was found to be as a result of proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane protein through the actions of the Œ≥-secretase complex catalytic subunit Presenilin. This was a significant interaction as Presenilin is implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease. This and further research into the mechanism of Notch signaing led to research that would further connect Notch to a wide range of human diseases.  Structure  Drosophila contain a single Notch protein, C. elegans contain two redundant notch paralogs, Lin-12 and GLP-1, and humans have four Notch variants, Notch 1-4. Although variations exist between homologs, there are a set of highly conserved structures found in all Notch family proteins. The protein can broadly be split into the Notch extracellular domain (NECD) and Notch intracellular domain (NICD) joined together by a single-pass transmembrane domain (TM). The NECD contains 36 EGF repeats in Drosophila, 28-36 in humans, and 13 and 10 in C. elegans Lin-12 and GLP-1 respectively. These repeats are heavily modified through O-glycoslyation and the addition of specific O-linked glycans has been shown to be necessary for proper function. The EGF repeats are followed by three cysteine-rich Lin-12/Notch Repeats (LNR) and a heterodimerization (HD) domain. Together the LNR and HD compose the negative regulatory region adjacent to the cell membrane and help prevent signaling in the absence of ligand binding. The NICD acts as a transcription factor that is released after ligand binding triggers its cleavage. It contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that mediates its translocation to the nucleus. where it forms a transcriptional complex along with several other transcription factors. Once in the nucleus, several akyrin repeats (ANK) and the RAM domain interactions between the NICD and CSL proteins to form a transcriptional activation complex. In humans, an additional PEST domain plays a role in NICD degradation.  Function  alt=The Notch signaling pathway. Notch interacts with its ligands Delta or Serrate, leading to cleavage of the NICD which can then interact with Su(H) to form a transcriptional complex. Notch family members play a role in a variety of developmental processes by controlling cell fate decisions. The Notch signaling network is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway that regulates interactions between physically adjacent cells. In Drosophila, notch interaction with its cell-bound ligands (delta, serrate) establishes an intercellular signaling pathway that plays a key role in development. This protein functions as a receptor for membrane bound ligands, and may play multiple roles during development. A deficiency can be associated with bicuspid aortic valve. There is evidence that activated Notch 1 and Notch 3 promote differentiation of progenitor cells into astroglia. Notch 1, then activated before birth, induces radial glia differentiation, but postnatally induces the differentiation into astrocytes. One study shows that Notch-1 cascade is activated by Reelin in an unidentified way. Reelin and Notch1 cooperate in the development of the dentate gyrus, according to another.  Ligand interactions  Notch signaling is triggered via direct cell-to-cell contact, mediated by interactions between the Notch receptor protein in the signal receiving cell and a ligand in an adjacent signal transmitting cell. These type 1 single pass transmembrane proteins fall into the Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) family of proteins which is named after the three canonical Notch ligands. Delta and Serrate are found in Drosophila while Lag-2 is found in C. elegans. Humans contain 3 Delta homologs, Delta-like 1, 3, and 4, as well as two Serrate homolgs, Jagged 1 and 2. Notch proteins consist of a relatively short intracellular domain and a large extracellular domain with one or more EGF motifs and a N-terminal DSL-binding motif. EGF repeats 11-12 on the Notch extracellular domain have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for trans signaling interactions between Notch and its ligands. Additionally, EGF repeats 24-29 have been implicated in inhibition of cis interactions between Notch and ligands co-expressed in the same cell.  Proteolysis  In order for a signaling event to occur, the Notch protein must be cleaved at several sites. In humans, Notch is first cleaved in the NRR domain by Furin while being processed in the trans-Golgi network before being presented on the cell surface as a heterodimer. Drosophila Notch does not require this cleavage for signaling to occur, and there is some evidence that suggests that LIN-12 and GLP-1 are cleaved at this site in C. elegans. Release of the NICD is achieved after an additional two cleavage events to Notch. Binding of Notch to a DSL ligand results in a conformational change that exposes a cleavage site in the NECD. Enzymatic proteolysis at this site is carried out by a A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease domain (ADAM) family protease. This protein is called Kuzbanian in Drosopihla, sup-17 in C. elegans, and ADAM10 in humans. After proteolytic cleavage, the released NECD is endocytosed into the signal transmitting cell, leaving behind only a small extracellular portion of Notch. This truncated Notch protein can then be recognized by a Œ≥-secretase that cleaves the third site found in the TM domain. Human homologs  Notch-1 Notch-2 Notch-2 (Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 2) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NOTCH2 gene. NOTCH2 is associated with Alagille syndrome and Hajdu‚ÄìCheney syndrome.

Both Clinton Avenue and Henry Johnson Boulevard are signed as U.S. Route 9. It was outside Albany's first boundaries as set up in the Dongan Charter of 1686. The original name of the area was Colonie (which is applied now to the current town to the north), and the area was incorporated under that name as a village in 1804; it was annexed by Albany in 1815. There are two sub-neighborhoods in Arbor Hill, Dudley Heights and the Ten Broeck Triangle. \\"Arbor Hill\\" was the name given to the Ten Broeck estate; the Ten Broeck Mansion is still an important cultural and historical museum. The neighborhood has other historical and cultural sights such as the Palace Theatre and St. Joseph's Church. Demographically it is predominantly African-American. History The Albany neighborhood of Arbor Hill had its start as a rural section of the neighboring town of Watervliet. The area was referred to as \\"the Colonie\\" and would be incorporated as a municipality in 1791, but would stay within Watervliet. Colonie would become incorporated again, this time as a district in 1801, and then as a village in 1804. In 1808 Colonie separated from Watervliet as a separate town. The trustees of the town, the voters of the town, and the common council of the city of Albany all approved annexation of the town to the city. The state on February 25, 1815, passed \\"An ACT to annex the Town of Colonie to the City of Albany\\". Many of the workers involved in building the Erie Canal settled here in the 1820s, but by the late 19th century the area‚Äîespecially the Ten Broeck Triangle section‚Äîbecame exclusive, catering to the new lumber industry barons. By the mid-20th century the decline of Albany's lumber industry led to a decline in fortunes for Arbor Hill. Once exclusive and prosperous, after the Great Depression, it became a distressed light industrial and residential neighborhood . In the early 20th Century, it was mostly settled by a mix of immigrants from Europe, but primarily Irish-Americans. During the administration of mayor Erastus Corning II (1942 to 1983), urban sprawl contributed to white flight, and the area lost much of its population. By the end of the 20th century, it became demographically predominantly African-American. The neighborhood police unit for Arbor Hill was introduced in September 1972 and funded by the federal Law Enforcement Administration Agency (LEAA), which paid for the staffing and training of 48 officers. As the LEAA fell victim to budget cuts, the city was left with little money for maintaining the units and staffing fell to 32 officers. Within one week a firebomb destroyed the building at the corner of Second and Lark streets. The unit then moved to a storefront at 133 Northern Boulevard (today Henry Johnson Boulevard), where it remained until April 4, 1986, when the unit was closed. The New Covenant Charter School was opened in Arbor Hill in 1999 as the first in the city and only the second in the state amid huge support as a means to reach minority and underperforming students. The school had miserable scores and high turnover in both the student population and among teachers. The charter school was finally closed in 2010. New Covenant was the second of the first three charter schools to close, the second to close in the Capital District and only the eighth in the state to be closed. Geography Arbor Hill includes the section of Albany west from Broadway to Henry Johnson Boulevard and north from Sheridan Hollow to Tivoli Hollow. Education Arbor Hill has one public elementary school (not counting charter schools): Arbor Hill Elementary School, at 1 Arbor Drive. Demographically, it is 89% Black, 5% Latino, 4% Multiracial, 1% White, and 1% Asian or Pacific Islander. 73% of students are eligible for the free or reduced price lunch program, and 3% have limited English proficiency. The attendance rate is 92%. The average class size is 18 students, and the student body is 393 students in K-6 as of 2007.

They appear to have independently and convergently evolved an Asp/Ser/His catalytic triad, like in the trypsin serine proteases. The structure of proteins in this family shows that they have an alpha/beta fold containing a 7-stranded parallel beta sheet. The subtilisin family is the second largest serine protease family characterised to date. Over 200 subtilases are presently known, more than 170 of which with their complete amino acid sequence. Subtilase is widespread, being found in eubacteria, archaebacteria, eukaryotes and viruses. The vast majority of the family are endopeptidases, although there is an exopeptidase, tripeptidyl peptidase. Structures have been determined for several members of the subtilisin family showing that subtilisins exploit the same catalytic triad as the chymotrypsins although the residues occur in a different order (His/Asp/Ser in chymotrypsin and Asp/His/Ser in subtilisin); otherwise the structures show similarity to no other proteins. Some subtilisins are mosaic proteins, whereas others contain N- and C-terminal extensions that show no sequence similarity to any other known protein. Based on sequence homology, a subdivision into six families has been proposed. The proprotein-processing endopeptidases kexin, furin and related enzymes form a distinct subfamily known as the kexin subfamily (S8B). These preferentially cleave C-terminally to paired basic amino acids. Members of this subfamily can be identified by subtly different motifs around the active site. Members of the kexin family, along with endopeptidases R, T and K from the yeast Tritirachium and cuticle- degrading peptidase from Metarhizium, require thiol activation. This can be attributed to the presence of Cys-173 near to the active histidine. Only 1 viral member of the subtilisin family is known, a 56-kDa protease from herpes virus 1, which infects the channel catfish. Sedolisins (serine-carboxyl peptidases) are proteolytic enzymes whose fold resembles that of subtilisin; however, they are considerably larger, with the mature catalytic domains containing approximately 375 amino acids. The defining features of these enzymes are a unique catalytic triad, Ser/Glu/Asp, as well as the presence of an aspartic acid residue in the oxyanion hole. High-resolution crystal structures have now been solved for sedolisin from Pseudomonas sp. 101, as well as for kumamolisin from a thermophilic bacterium, Bacillus novo sp. MN-32.

It was directed by Peter Foldes and is one of the first computer animation films. The story, told without words, is a morality tale about greed and gluttony in contemporary society. National Research Council Peter Foldes worked in collaboration with the National Research Council's Division of Radio and Electrical Engineering's Data Systems Group, who decided to develop a computer animation application in 1969. NRC scientist Nestor Burtnyk had heard an animator from Disney explain the traditional animation process, where a head animator draws the key cels and assistants draw the fill in pictures. The work of the artist's assistant seemed to Burtnyk to be the ideal demonstration vehicle for computer animation and within a year he programmed a \\"key frame animation\\" package to create animated sequences from key frames. The NFB in Montreal was contacted so that artists could experiment with computer animation. Foldes made a 1971 experimental film involving freehand drawings called Metadata. This was followed by Hunger, which took him and his NRC partners a year and a half to make. Awards Awards for Hunger included a Special Jury Prize at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival,https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/films/la-faim a BAFTA Award for Best Animation Film and a Silver Hugo at the Chicago International Film Festival. The film was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 47th Academy Awards.

Gregg (born Robert Grego; April 30, 1936 ‚Äì May 3, 2014) was an American musician who performed as a drummer and record producer. As a drum soloist and band leader he recorded one album and several singles, including one Top 40 single in the United States. But he is better known for his work as a drummer on several seminal 1960s songs, including Bob Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and Simon and Garfunkel's \\"The Sound of Silence\\". He was also temporarily a member of The Hawks, which later became known as The Band. Early career Gregg first attracted attention by 1955 as the only white member of the otherwise all-black group Steve Gibson and the Red Caps. By 1962, he fronted Bobby Gregg and His Friends for an instrumental single, \\"The Jam - Part 1\\", which reached #14 on the Billboard R&B; chart and #29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The B-side of the single was \\"The Jam ‚Äì Part 2\\". That same year, Gregg put out another instrumental single titled \\"Potato Peeler\\", which only reached #89 on the Billboard's Hot 100, but became well known for containing the first ever known pinch harmonic to be in a song. Guitarist Roy Buchanan crafted the technique. The song bears a strong resemblance to another instrumental record, \\"The Hunch\\" performed by The Bobby Peterson Quintet, which was released 3 years earlier in 1959. In 1963, he put out an album, released on Epic Records, called Let's Stomp and Wild Weekend. In 1964 and 1965, he released the singles \\"Any Number Can Win\\", \\"MacDougal Street\\", \\"It's Good to Me\\" and \\"Charly Ba-Ba\\". He also acted as a record producer at this time, producing songs by Sun Ra, Erma Franklin, Richard \\"Popcorn\\" Wylie and Frank Hunter. He sometimes played the drums on the records he produced. Gregg was also a house studio drummer For Cameo Parkway Records (a commercially successful independent record label based in Philadelphia) in the late 1950s early 1960s. while he was there, he played for artists such as Bobby Rydell, Chubby Checker, the Dovells Dee Dee Sharp and many others on many of the label‚Äôs hits. He continued to do this until the hits dried up for the label during the onslaught of the British Invasion and that is when moved from Philadelphia to New York officially in 1964. Work with Bob Dylan In 1964, as an experiment, Bob Dylan's producer Tom Wilson wanted to see what Dylan's 1962 recording of \\"House of the Rising Sun\\" would sound like if the original solo acoustic guitar backing was replaced by a band playing electric instruments. Gregg was brought in to play drums on the replacement backing track. In January 1965, Gregg got to work with Dylan as the drummer on the songs on the electric side of the album Bringing It All Back Home. Gregg recorded the album takes of \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\", \\"She Belongs to Me\\", \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\", \\"Outlaw Blues\\" and \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" on January 14, 1965 and recorded the album takes of \\"Maggie's Farm\\" and \\"On the Road Again\\" on January 15, 1965. On June 15, 1965, when Dylan was ready to record \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", several of the musician from the Bringing It All Back Home sessions including Gregg were called on to back him. Thus, it is Gregg's pistol-like snare drum shot that opens the song, as well as the album Highway 61 Revisited. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" eventually reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and in 2004 was named by Rolling Stone as the #1 song of all time. The remainder of the Highway 61 Revisited album was recorded between July 29 and August 4, 1965. Gregg was the drummer for the July 29 and 30 sessions that produced \\"Tombstone Blues\\", \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\" and \\"From a Buick 6\\". He was also the drummer for the July 29 recording of \\"Positively 4th Street\\", which was left off the Highway 61 Revisited album but became a Top 10 single in both the United States and the UK. At the August 2 session at which \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\", \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" and \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" were recorded, Sam Lay played the drums in the early in the session due to Gregg's other commitments, with Gregg joining the session later. Although Lay is believed to be the drummer on the album take of \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" and played on several takes of \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\", the album take of \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" is generally believed to be one that Gregg played on. Gregg was also the likely drummer for \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\" and \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\", meaning that Gregg played on all the songs on the album except \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" and \\"Desolation Row\\" (on which there is no drum part), and Gregg is the only drummer credited on the album. In November 1965, Gregg joined the Hawks, who were then backing Dylan on tour, when Hawks' drummer Levon Helm left. He remained with the Hawks for about a month before being replaced by Sandy Konikoff. He recorded with Dylan in the November 30 sessions at which an early version of \\"Visions of Johanna\\" and possibly the single release of \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\" were recorded. He also recorded with Dylan at the January 1966 Blonde on Blonde sessions at which \\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\" was recorded, as well as several other songs which either did not make the album or were rerecorded later for the album, including \\"I'll Keep It With Mine\\", which was eventually released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961‚Äì1991. Work with other artists In 1965 Tom Wilson, who had produced Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home and \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" decided to experiment with electrifying the Simon & Garfunkel song \\"The Sound of Silence\\". An acoustic version of \\"The Sound of Silence\\" had been released on the Simon & Garfunkel album Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.. As he did with Dylan's version of \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\", Wilson employed a band to record an electric backing track for the song, without Paul Simon's or Art Garfunkel's knowledge. Bobby Gregg was once again the drummer Wilson employed in the band creating this backing track. The version of \\"The Sound of Silence\\" incorporating the electric band backing track became a #1 hit and was released on the Simon & Garfunkel album Sounds of Silence. It was also listed by Rolling Stone as the #156 song of all time. In 1966, Gregg was one of the drummers backing Peter, Paul and Mary for their album The Peter, Paul and Mary Album. In 1971, he backed John Cale and Terry Riley on their album Church of Anthrax. The lyrics of \\"Despite the Current Mess\\", a song by The Stone Hill All-Stars (Baltimore, Maryland) mention Bobby Gregg; \\"He waits in the doorway of the Deco Chrysler building as sunlight starts to fade. He liked to entertain the image of him standing in Paul Simon's deep and dark December, because he liked the way Bobby Gregg drummed happily against the somber tirade.\\" Death Gregg died on May 3, 2014 at the age of 78.

Its headquarters is at the National Military Museum, Fort Montana, Caracas. The Commanding General of the National Militia is Major General Carlos Augusto Leal Teller√≠a, Venezuelan Army, as of March 2018. The National Militia celebrates its anniversary every April 13 yearly.  Mission  According to the Article 46 of the organic law establishing the Militia, its functions are: * Enlist, organize, equip, instruct, train and retrain formed units of the National Bolivarian Militia; * Establish permanent links between the National Bolivarian Armed Forces and the Venezuelan people, in order to contribute to ensuring the overall defence of Venezuela; * Organize and train the Territorial Militia's personnel and unit to implement the comprehensive defense operations to ensure the defense of sovereignty and national independence; * Contribute to the Operational Strategic Command, in the development and implementation of plans for integral defence of the Nation and National Mobilization; * Participate and contribute to the development of technology and military industry, without restrictions other than those provided for in the Constitution of the Republic and the laws; * Guide, coordinate and support community councils in the areas of competence in order to assist in the implementation of public policies; * Contribute and advise on the establishment and consolidation of integral defence committees of communal councils in order to strengthen the civil- military union; * Collect, process and disseminate information and consolidation of community councils, public institutions and private sector, necessary for the development of plans, programs, projects of integral development of the Nation and National Mobilization; * Coordinate with the organs, bodies and agencies of the public and private sectors, the creation and organization of the Combatant Corps, which administratively depend thereon, in order to contribute to the overall defence of the Nation; supervise and train the Combatant Corps, which report directly to Headquarters, National Militia, * Other duties specified by laws and regulations of the Republic as authorized by proper authorities and enacted by the National Assembly. Organization The General Command of the National Militia is divided in three branches of its own plus a third branch divided into the two: * The National Reserve Service, consisting of all Venezuelan citizens who are not in active military service, or have completed national military service, or who voluntarily join the reserve units (all active reserve units are not part of the NM but of the service branches of the NAF) * The Territorial Guard Component, consisting of all Venezuelan citizens who voluntarily serve to organize local resistance to any external threat to the nation. These are divided into the Special Resistance Combatant Corps, aimed at the wartime and peacetime defense of public institutions and state and private enterprises, and the Workers' Territorial Militia Components divided into: ** General Employment Militia Detachments, the mobile quick action component stationed in all the states of Venezuela, metropolitan areas and cities ** Territorial Employment Militia Battalions, stationed strategically in key cities and townships in Venezuela and areas of key importance ** Community Militia Detachments, stationed in all townships and cities in all the states of Venezuela, mandated to keep the public order and defend government institutions and economical assets like factories ** Rural Employment Militia Battalions, stationed in all public farmlands * The People's Navy Branch, raised in 2013, which is the naval militia component that is mandated towards the defense of the Venezuelan coastline and territorial waters, itself divided into the Naval Reserve Command (part of the NRS) and the Workers' Naval Employment Territorial Militia Battalions, part of the TGC * The People's National Defense Corps, raised in 2018, which serves as the operational reserve of the National Armed Forces in protecting public order and security Venezuelan National Militia in Caracas, Venezuela on 5 March 2014 during the commemoration of Hugo Chavez's death. Today the General Command of the National Militia is organized on the basis of nine Reserve brigades, present throughout the national territory, dozen Special Resistance Corps (grouped around workers contingents of state and private sector enterprises and national institutions at all levels) plus the territorial national service militia commands mentioned, and even a newly created national guards brigade, and in the future, armor and aviation units.Milicia Bolivariana tendr√° batallones de tanques.

It is an autonomous and auxiliary force for the Armed Forces' service branches, with its own chain of command and service arms, reporting directly to the President, the Minister of Defense and the Operational Strategic Command. It can be estimated at the present time about 400,000 men and women are on various training levels, but the target of its authorities is to reach 1,100,000 part-time servicemen and women in the coming years. Today more than 160,000 men and women serve actively in the militia, with plans to have a half-a-million-strong active force of reserve national servicemen and women in 2015. Following the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis and its subsequent protests, President Maduro announced the expansion of the militia to include 500,000 personnel, stating that the government would purchase a new rifle for each militiaman, with plans to increase its personnel numbers to about over a million active service personnel plus an undetermined number of reserves. The next year in December 2018, Maduro claimed that the militia grew by 1.6 million members, he also said during a speech that he would extensively arm the militia. Controversy The National Boliviarian Militia has been described as a \\"political army\\" created by Hugo Ch√°vez that has hundreds of thousands of members in service, including military reservists and employees of state and public enterprises at all levels. The militia is \\"under the direct command of the president\\" as the Commander in Chief of the National Armed Forces (through the authority of the Defense Minister and the Commandant of the Operational Strategic Command) and \\"are trained to defend the (Bolivarian) revolution of internal and external enemies\\". It has been alleged by El Mundo that the militia has sometimes used \\"violence to silence dissent or journalists who do not bow to the discourse of the regime\\".

Above a certain threshold size, which varies with planetary gravity, the collapse and modification of the transient cavity is much more extensive, and the resulting structure is called a complex crater. The collapse of the transient cavity is driven by gravity, and involves both the uplift of the central region and the inward collapse of the rim. The central uplift is not the result of elastic rebound which is a process in which a material with elastic strength attempts to return to its original geometry; rather the uplift is a process in which a material with little or no strength attempts to return to a state of gravitational equilibrium. Complex craters have uplifted centers, and they have typically broad flat shallow crater floors, and terraced walls. At the largest sizes, one or more exterior or interior rings may appear, and the structure may be labeled an impact basin rather than an impact crater. Complex-crater morphology on rocky planets appears to follow a regular sequence with increasing size: small complex craters with a central topographic peak are called central-peak craters, for example Tycho; intermediate-sized craters, in which the central peak is replaced by a ring of peaks, are called peak ring craters, for example Schr√∂dinger; and the largest craters contain multiple concentric topographic rings, and are called multi-ringed basins, for example Orientale. On icy as opposed to rocky bodies, other morphological forms appear which may have central pits rather than central peaks, and at the largest sizes may contain very many concentric rings ‚Äì Valhalla on Callisto is the type example of the latter. Complex craters are classified into two groups: central-peak and peak- ring craters. Peak-ring craters have diameters that are larger in than central-peak craters and have a ring of raised massifs which are roughly half the rim-to-rim diameter, instead of a central peak. Central-peak craters Eddie crater, a central peak-ring crater on Mars A central-peak crater is the most basic form of complex crater. A central peak crater can have a tightly spaced, ring-like arrangement of peaks, thus be a peak ring crater, though the peak is often single. Central-peak craters can occur in impact craters, via meteorites. An Earthly example is Mistastin crater, in Canada. They also occur due to volcanism, as in Valles Caldera. Many central-peak craters have rims that are scalloped, terraced inner walls, and hummocky floors. When central peaks form Diameters of craters where complex features form depends on the strength of gravity of the celestial body they occur on. Stronger gravity, such as on Earth compared to the Moon, causes rim collapse in smaller diameter craters. Complex craters may occur at to on Earth, but start from on the Moon. If lunar craters have diameters between about to , the central peak is usually a single peak, or small group of peaks. Lunar craters of diameter greater than about may have complex, ring-shaped uplifts. If impact features exceed of diameter, they are called impact basins, not craters. Lunar craters of to about in diameter possess a central peak. There are several theories as to why central peak craters form. Such craters are common, on Earth, Earth's moon, Mars, and Mercury. Height of central peak relative to crater diameter On Earth's moon, heights of central peaks are directly proportional to diameters of craters, which implies that peak height varies with crater-forming energy. There is a similar relationship for terrestrial meteorite craters, and TNT craters whose uplifts originated from rebound.

Personal life Casey was born in Saraland, Alabama, one of nine children to John and Viola Casey. John was of Irish ancestry; Viola claimed American Indian Blood--less than one eighth Creek Indian]. After the family moved to a Mississippi cotton farm, Casey attended school at Agricola, Mississippi. Once she graduated, she married and had a son, but soon divorced. Professional wrestling career In 1962, while working at the ticket counter for a professional wrestling promotion, she met The Fabulous Moolah, who offered to train Casey to wrestle. Casey soon decided to take Moolah up on her offer and moved to South Carolina to train. Her first match was a tag team match that pitted her and Judy Grable against Rita Cortez and Brenda Scott that fall. Casey also wrestled Miss Brenda in a two out of three falls match for the opening of a December 1962 card also featuring Fred Blassie. While working under Moolah, Casey traveled all around the United States; she was also one of the first women to ever compete in a tag team match in the state of Hawaii. While in Hawaii, Casey fell in love with a local champion surfer and took a brief hiatus from wrestling. Two years later, Casey returned to the continental United States and professional wrestling. She worked for promoters Vince McMahon, Sr., Vince McMahon, Jr., and Leroy McGuirk. During this time, she wrestled Donna Christanello at Madison Square Garden in New York. In 1964, she had a match that pitted her and Penny Banner against Cora Combs and Kathy O'Brien. The following year, she defeated Kay Noble in a match, but was defeated in another match by Bette Boucher. She was also defeated by Mae Young in a 1968 NWA United States Women's Championship match. With Vivian Vachon as her partner, Casey defeated Donna Christanello and Cora Combs in a 1970 match. In 1972, Casey discovered that her son had gotten involved in drug trafficking with a truck driver, and after she forced him to stop, the truck driver shot her six times. Although the doctors told her that her professional wrestling career was over, Casey was able to wrestle again within several months. In 1974, Moolah offered to let Casey win the USA Women's Wrestling Championship from her, and Casey was subsequently never defeated for the belt. Later that year in December, Casey also won the vacated NWA United States Women's Championship by defeating Toni Rose in a match. She held the championship for approximately four years before losing it to Joyce Grable. Meanwhile, wrestling magazine Pro Wrestling Illustrated recognized Casey as the \\"Girl Wrestler of the Year\\" in 1975. Retirement Casey's last match occurred in 1990, when she defeated Judy Grable to retain the USA Women's Championship. In 2004, she was honored by the Cauliflower Alley Club, an association for retired professional wrestlers. Casey remarried and had a daughter in the 1970s. She still occasionally wrestled, and from 1980 to 1985, she worked for the Mississippi Forestry Commission. Afterward, she received her paralegal license, as well as a bachelor's degree in criminal justice with a minor in psychology from the University of South Alabama. After divorcing her second husband, she began working as a bail bondsman. Subsequently, she opened a restaurant and drove trucks. Since retiring from the ring, Ann Casey has written her autobiography. It is titled ‚ÄòAutobiography of professional woman wrestler, Ann Casey,‚Äô and subtitled: ‚ÄòThe Lady, The Life, The Legend.‚Äô Since 2009 Casey has been printing on demand and sending copies on request to her faithful fans. The book comprises more than three volumes and is over 1,000 pages long. A shorter adaptation of Casey's autobiography appeared in Brooklyn-based sports magazine Victory Journal in December, 2014, titled: \\"The Legend of Panther Girl\\", subtitled: \\"She fought to win.

It is produced by Miguel √Ångel Herros. The series centers on the Mexican people's relationship to the Catholic religion, specifically to the Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe. It is set in modern times, most often in Mexico City, but the location may vary in some episodes. In the United States the series premiered on June 26, 2008.  Plot  There are two types of beginnings for the episodes: a happy beginning, or a more melodramatic beginning where the main character undergoes a calamitous event that kickstarts their development. In the latter, the editor, cast, and director's credits roll during the second scene. Main characters, being extremely devout to the Virgin of Guadalupe, almost always ask her to protect them. At the same time, a white rose appears before an altar or statue of the Virgin that belongs to the person who prayed or is in trouble, and remains there during the development of the story, which usually sees an escalation of the problem. The rose's appearance means that the petition has been heard by the Virgin. At the climax of the story, the closest person \\"asked\\" by the Virgin intercedes for the main character and tries to help. When the issue is resolved, the main character is \\"touched\\" by a wind that represents the act of the Virgin of Guadalupe, and at the end of the episode, the white rose disappears as a character narrates the message of the episode.  History   \\"Las mil rosas\\" (\\"The Thousand Roses\\")  On July 5, 2017, the series began its 1,000th episode celebration. Remastered versions of the earliest episodes from 2008 to 2016 were aired beginning July 10, 2017. On July 22, 2017, the 1,000th episode, \\"The Bastard Sister\\", was aired. Alejandra Barros and Alexis Ayala starred in the episode.  Impact stories  Starting in May 2017, \\"La rosa de Guadalupe\\" began broadcasting episodes with more serious, social issue-driven \\"impact\\" stories on Saturdays at 9:30 pm. These stories featured more explicit topics such as rape, incest, sexual harassment, murder, and drug addiction. The content rating given to these Saturday night episodes is B-15, whereas the content rating of episodes broadcast during the business week is B.  Reception  The show has been panned by Mexican viewers and critics for its lack of proper acting, writing, and directing. Some talk shows have criticized the low-fidelity effects and poor acting, as well as the lack of research for episodes dealing with certain social groups or issues such as bullying, family problems, and even sexual abuse. La rosa de Guadalupe is considered the most controversial series Televisa has ever transmitted throughout Latin America, constantly subjected to criticism since its first broadcast. It consistently portrays children and adolescents as antagonists. It is also criticized for insinuating that society's problems are only resolved through prayers and divine intervention and for presenting an exaggerated reality about Catholics, in addition to casting young actors with poor performances. Nonetheless, the controversy has brought a sizable amount of attention to the series and created a cult following online, where it is viewed as a source of accidental comedy.  Websites  La rosa de Guadalupe has been mocked on social networks such as Facebook, where they often make memes that make fun of the episodes and their characters; also YouTube users have mocked the episodes and even performed parodies. Within the same Televisa, several comedians have also made fun of the series, within sketches of different comedy programs.  Rivalry  In 2009, a similar program, A cada quien su santo, began airing on TV Azteca; during an hour, a case in some regions of the country is presented praising the faith of a particular saint, while in Televisa, there are narrative cases about miracles performed by the Virgin of Guadalupe.

Mutant forms of vWF are involved in the aetiology of bleeding disorders. This type A domain is the prototype for a protein superfamily (; see also Pfam clan). The vWA domain is found in various plasma proteins: complement factors B, C2, CR3 and CR4; the integrins (I-domains); collagen types VI, VII, XII and XIV; and other extracellular proteins. Although the majority of vWA-containing proteins are extracellular, the most ancient ones present in all eukaryotes are all intracellular proteins involved in functions such as transcription, DNA repair, ribosomal and membrane transport and the proteasome. A common feature appears to be involvement in multiprotein complexes. Proteins that incorporate vWA domains participate in numerous biological events (e.g. cell adhesion, migration, homing, pattern formation, and signal transduction), involving interaction with a large array of ligands. A number of human diseases arise from mutations in vWA domains. Secondary structure prediction from 75 aligned vWA sequences has revealed a largely alternating sequence of alpha-helices and beta-strands. Fold recognition algorithms were used to score sequence compatibility with a library of known structures: the vWA domain fold was predicted to be a doubly wound, open, twisted beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices. 3D structures have been determined for the I-domains of integrins CD11b (with bound magnesium) and CD11a (with bound manganese). The domain adopts a classic alpha/beta Rossmann fold and contains an unusual metal ion coordination site at its surface. It has been suggested that this site represents a general metal ion- dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) for binding protein ligands. The residues constituting the MIDAS motif in the CD11b and CD11a I-domains are completely conserved, but the manner in which the metal ion is coordinated differs slightly.

The inaugural season began on July 2, 1987 and concluded on August 22, 1987. The league was founded by literary agent Jay Acton and Eric Margenau. The pair also owned several affiliated minor league baseball clubs in the New York‚ÄìPenn League. The league sought to draw attention in the busy New York sports market by hiring four African American as managers. They were former major leaguers Paul Blair and George Scott as well as Bernardo Leonard and Brian Flood, nephew of major-leaguer Curt Flood. Scott's son, Dion Williams, a former minor leaguer, also played in the league for his father. The four teams in the league took their names from Long Island's fishing industry. They were the Diggers (managed by Scott), the Reapers (managed by Leonard), the Whalers (managed by Flood) and the Sound (managed by Blair). About two weeks into the season, Flood was replaced by Mike DeSola. The teams played 50 games in 50 days at Long Island's Hofstra University. The players were drawn from colleges across the United States and were paid $350 per month. The rosters included Joe Charno, Fairfield; Scott Waserfall, Fordham; Dave DePaul, Davidson; Tim Simms, Alabama; Jude Rinaldi, Troy State, Greg Polli, Hofstra; John Bilello, Hofstra; Vic Crema, Adelphi; Bobby Cassidy, Post; Mike Gianfrancesco, Post; Matt Dimakos, Buffalo; Keith Locklear, New York Tech; Paul DiGregorio, St. John's. Acton, and his co-owner, Fraser Scott, the former middleweight boxer, signed two players from the Empire State League to the Watertown Pirates, of the NY-Penn League‚ÄîMatt Dimakos and Pat Crosby. Later in the season, the San Jose Bees, of the California State League, signed a slew of players from the Empire State League, including Polli, Bilello, Rinaldo and Joe Mancini, who played three additional years in the minors. Closed-league tryouts headed by Blair and Scott were held in the New York and New Jersey areas for prospective talent. Standouts included John Blum (Concordia College), Joseph Ferrara (Concordia College) and Tony Tunno (Hofstra University) who threw upwards of 93 mph. Tunno and Ferrara were up and coming but injuries shortened their careers. The Empire State League, although short in its tenure, drew recognition from some major league organizations. With much of the talent from the league raided by other minor league teams, the season ended and the Whalers defeated the Diggers for the championships. 1987 Empire State League final standings * Diggers 28‚Äì17 * Reapers 22‚Äì23 * Whalers 22‚Äì25 * Sound 19‚Äì26 The league moved to Staten Island for the 1988 season but folded after only two weeks of competition.

Hornet saw most of her active duty during the French Revolutionary Wars. During the Napoleonic Wars she served for about six years as a hospital ship before being laid up in 1811 and sold in 1817. Service Hornet was commissioned in March 1794 under Commander Christmas Paul. On 26 June 1794 she fired a salute to the King and Queen while they were visiting Portsmouth. Hornet shared with , , , and in the capture of the Lust en Vlyt on 22 August. Hornet was then paid off February 1795 and recommissioned under W. Lakin. In January 1796 Commander Robert Larkan sailed her in Home waters. On 4 February 1796 Hornet was in company with the hired armed cutter Grand Falconer when they recaptured the Portuguese brig Diana. Next, on 17 May, Hornet captured the French transport Emilie. Then in November 1796, Commander John Nash replaced Larkan. On 10 March 1798 the Admiralty published a list of six vessels that , under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball, and Hornet had captured off Gor√©e: *American snow Rebecca, which had sailed from Charlestown. Her cargo included pitch, tar, dry goods, tobacco, molasses and gunpowder. The British took the naval and gunpowder, which they landed, and then released the vessel. *American ship President, carrying a cargo of salt belonging to English merchants. The French had taken the ship off the Islands de Loss and the British had recaptured her off the mouth of the River Gambia. The British returned the vessel and her cargo to the owner after receiving salvage money. *Ship , late of Liverpool, which the British recaptured. She was of 260 tons, 10 guns and a crew of 36. She was trading on the coast and had a cargo of merchandise and 337 slaves. *Sloop Ocean, which the British recaptured and which had belonged to the Sierra Leone Company. She was carrying cloth, iron, beads and ten slaves. *French schooner Prosperit√©, carrying Guinea Corn. She was disposed of at Gor√©e. *The British destroyed the armed ship Bell, of 20 guns. Daedalus and letters of marque Ellis and St Ann shared, by agreement, in the capture of Quaker (December 1797) and Ocean (January 1798). This Ellis was almost surely the ship that received her warrant on 18 September 1797. She was under the command of James Soutar, was of 303 tons burthen, and was armed with sixteen 8, 9, and 12-pounder guns. She is listed as having had only 30 crew. St Ann is in all probability the St Anne that received her warrant on 30 September 1797. She was under the command of Robert James, was of 243 tons burthen, and was armed with sixteen 9-pounders. She too had a crew of 30 men.Register of Letters of Marque against France 1793-1815, 1812privateers.org Hornet was refitted for ¬£3,554 at Portsmouth in June and July 1799. In August Hornet was part of the British fleet that captured the Dutch fleet in the Vlieter Incident. Nash then sailed Hornet to the West Indies. In 1800 she accompanied a convoy to the West Indies. While at Guadeloupe in October, a boat from Hornet attempted to press some men off the New Ceres, whose crew resisted, killing Hornets second lieutenant, and wounding another crewman. The next day Hornet tried again, this time in force, but all the crew except the chief mate and steward had disappeared. Captain Nash turned the two men over to the civil authorities.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.517. On 27 November 1800, Hornet captured the French privateer Femme Divorcee. On 16 October Hornet captured the French privateer Mahomet. On 15 January 1801, the 20-gun , Captain Richard Matson, 18-gun ship-sloops and Hornet, captains Henry Matson and John Nash, and the (a schooner serving as a tender), were at an anchor in the harbour of the √éles des Saintes. The British observed a convoy of French coasters, with an armed schooner as escort, sailing towards Vieux-Fort, Guadeloupe. At midnight Garland, together with two boats from each of the other three vessels, attempted to cut out the convoy. However, all of the convoy, but one, were able to shelter under the guns of Basse-Terre. The British were able to take the one French vessel that had anchored near Vieux-Fort. On 17 January, boats from Hornet, together with boats from Daphne, set out to cut out a ship moored under the protection of shore batteries at Trois-Rivi√®res, Guadeloupe. This was Eclair, a schooner that had recently sailed from Rochefort. Eclair was of 145 tons, had a crew of 45 men, and was armed with four 4-pounder guns and twenty 1¬Ω-pounder brass swivel guns, though she was pierced for 12 guns. A party from Garland succeeded in taking Eclair the next day. Fire from the schooner killed two men and wounded another. The French lost one seaman killed, two drowned, and her captain, first and second lieutenants, and six men wounded.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp. 133-4. The British took her into service as the 10-gun . In March, Hornet participated in Rear Admiral Duckworth's successful attack on the islands of St. Bartholomew and St. Martin. On 23 March, Hornet and the 16-gun hired armed brig Fanny, later joined by 14-gun , attempted to capture two privateers, a brig and a schooner, but were unsuccessful though they chased the privateers for some 24 hours. The 32-gun frigate , Hornet, and Drake stayed at St. Martin to secure the island and to embark the garrison on 26 March, while the rest of Duckworth's force went on to St Thomas. The proceeds of the property seized at St. Bartholomew, St. Martin, St. Thomas, and St. Croix between 15 March and 17 April was paid out in January 1804. At some point thereafter, Hornet was in company with when they captured the Spanish vessel Aguilla. In August 1802 Hornet came under the command of Lieutenant Robert Tucker. Next month Commander Peter Hunt replaced Tucker. In June 1803, Hornet was in Commodore Samuel Hood's squadron at the capture of St. Lucia. The squadron, including Hornet, went on to capture Tobago on 25 June. On 3 September Hornet captured a Dutch ship, whose name was not recorded, that was carrying 410 slaves. Then in September Hood went on to take the colonies of Demerara and Essequibo from the Batavian Republic. On 20 September Hornet, the schooner , and 200 troops entered the Demerara River and took possession of Fort William Frederick. At the capitulation, the British took over the Batavian Republic's sole warship there, . In 1804 Commander John Lawrence took command of Hornet. Fate Grave of Henry Williams in Tresco Abbey Gardens Paid off in 1804 from active service, Hornet was fitted at Plymouth between September 1804 and July 1805 for the Medical Military Staff, and was commissioned in June 1805 under Lieutenant Charles Williams as a hospital ship in the Isles of Scilly. Charles's brother, Henry Williams, fell overboard in 1810 and was drowned. He was buried in the Tresco Abbey Gardens. Fate Hornet was paid off from her service as a hospital ship and was laid up at Plymouth Dockyard in May 1811. The \\"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\\" first offered the \\"Hornet sloop, of 429 tons\\", lying at Plymouth, for sale on 30 January 1817. Hornet finally sold on 30 October 1817 to a Mr Bailey for ¬£920 (). Notable personnel From November 1795 to September 1797, Richard Spencer, a future hero of the Napoleonic Wars and Australian pioneer, served as a midshipman on Hornet.

The phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB, also phosphotyrosine-interaction or PI domain) in the protein tensin tends to be found at the C-terminus. Tensin is a multi-domain protein that binds to actin filaments and functions as a focal-adhesion molecule (focal adhesions are regions of plasma membrane through which cells attach to the extracellular matrix). Human tensin has actin-binding sites, an SH2 () domain and a region similar to the tumour suppressor PTEN. The PTB domain interacts with the cytoplasmic tails of beta integrin by binding to an NPXY motif. The phosphotyrosine-binding domain of insulin receptor substrate-1 is not related to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of tensin. Insulin receptor substrate-1 proteins contain both a pleckstrin homology domain and a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain. The PTB domains facilitate interaction with the activated tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor. The PTB domain is situated towards the N terminus. Two arginines in this domain are responsible for hydrogen bonding phosphotyrosine residues on an Ac-LYASSNPApY-NH2 peptide in the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor. Further interactions via \\"bridged\\" water molecules are coordinated by residues an Asn and a Ser residue. The PTB domain has a compact, 7-stranded beta-sandwich structure, capped by a C-terminal helix. The substrate peptide fits into an L-shaped surface cleft formed from the C-terminal helix and strands 5 and 6.

He served as chief minister during his brother's reign, but was dismissed and imprisoned by his successor, John Tzimiskes. Depiction of Leo's victory at Andrassos, from the Madrid Skylitzes Leo was the younger son of Bardas Phokas the Elder, a noted general and longtime commander of the eastern armies under Constantine VII, and of an unnamed lady from the Maleinos clan. Leo was first appointed as strategos of the thema of Cappadocia in 945, and about ten years later, he was promoted to the post of strategos of the prestigious Anatolic Theme. Under Romanos II, he was named Domestic of the Schools of the West, i.e. commander of the western armies in the Balkans, and raised to the rank of magistros. When his older brother Nikephoros was detailed to assault the Emirate of Crete in 960, Leo replaced him as domestikos of the West, a new institution. From this position, he scored a notable victory against the Empire's old adversary, the emir of Aleppo Sayf al-Daula, whose army had invaded Byzantine Asia Minor, made good progress, and was retiring laden with booty and prisoners. Leo waylaid him in a rocky defile, and destroyed most of the Arab army, while Sayf al-Daula barely managed to flee. Due to his record of successful service in the Byzantine-Arab frontier, he has been suggested as the possible author of the treatise De velitatione bellica (\\"On skirmishing warfare\\"). When Nikephoros ascended the throne in 963, Leo was named kouropalates and assumed the post of logothetes tou dromou, remaining his brother's chief minister until the overthrow and murder of Nikephoros by Tzimiskes in 969. In 970, Leo unsuccessfully tried to rebel against Tzimiskes, and was exiled to Lesbos. After another failed attempt at rebellion in 971 however, he was banished to the island of Prote and blinded. The date of his death is unknown. Leo was the father of Bardas Phokas the Younger and Sophia Phokaina, wife of Constantine Skleros and mother of Otto II's wife Theophanu.

After graduation, he joined films. His first effort was Rajamabal, produced by Aruna Films. His early memorable roles were in films such as Vannakkili, Kaidhi Kannayiram, Vallavanukku Vallavan, Vallavan Oruvan and Iru Vallavargal. But Manohar is best remembered for the negative roles he played, especially while facing off with M. G. Ramachandran in films such as Ayirathil Oruvan, Ulagam Suttrum Valliban, Pallandu Vazhga, Adimai Penn, Kaavalkaaran and Idayakkani. Manohar is also be remembered for his immense contributions to Tamil theatre. After Nawab Rajamanikkam, it was Manohar who took theatre to a higher plane. Most of the 31 plays in which he acted - altogether totaling 7,950 performances - were adaptations or interpretations of historical incidents or mythological stories. Famous among Manohar's plays are Ilangeswaran, Chanakkiya Sabadam, Soorapadman, Sisupalan, Indrajith, Sukrachariyar, Naragasooran and Thirunavukkarasar. He was a pioneer in introducing 'dramascope' with stereophonic sound system, split second transformation of sets and pyrotechniques to represent battle scenes. He received many awards for his contributions to drama and cinema, including a 'Nadaka Kavalar' award from MGR in 1970.

Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ picks up where Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam left off with Haman Khan, regent to Mineva Lao Zabi, planning an invasion of Earth. It continues to follow Bright Noa and the ship Argama as well as introduce several new characters. Protagonists AEUG ; : :A 14-year-old boy from the Shangri-La colony. During the final battle with Paptimus Scirocco, Kamille Bidan, the hero from Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, was placed into a vegetable-like state after crashing the MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam into Scirocco's mobile suit PMX-003 The O. This left the problem aboard the Argama (the main AEUG ship of the show) with no central Gundam pilot for the ship. After the Argama docks at the Side 1 colony of Shangri-La, Judau attempts twice to steal the Zeta Gundam but each time he's caught and forced to return the suit. Eventually, Judau becomes a member of the Argama's crew and the new pilot for the MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam. Notably, his group of rag-tag OutworldShangri-La friends included the bossy Beecha Oleg, Beecha's side-kick Mondo Agake, the timid Iino Abbav. Judau has had numerous female characters around him. Elle Vianno, who was not afraid to make herself clear and later the crew is joined by Anaheim Electronics/AEUG pilot, Roux Louka. As events progress, Judau receives the MSZ-010 Double Zeta Gundam from Anaheim Electronics to more effectively combat the threat of Axis and its new army. Judau uses the ZZ Gundam to great effect throughout the series. Eventually he uses the Double Zeta to defeat Axis Leader Haman Karn in a duel. In an early battle, before Axis declares itself Neo Zeon, Judau's younger sister, Leina Ashta, is captured by Glemmy Toto. Glemmy is enthralled by Leina and spends most of the time teaching her 'civilized' customs, such as ballet, musical instruments, and being a 'lady', to pose a greater image of the Zeon movement. Because of this, a great deal of the series deals with Judau trying to find his sister. At one point, when Neo Zeon forces occupy the Federation Assembly at Dakar, Leina manages to escape from her captivity. Unfortunately, Leina and Judau met up with Haman, who injures Leina during a shooting. When Judau takes Leina to a cabin to rest, he's suddenly caught up in a mobile suit battle, and one of the damaged mobile suits crashes into the cabin. Judau thinks that Leina had perished, but later found out that Leina had escaped, and was rescued by former White Base pilot, Sayla Mass. Falsely thinking his sister is dead the incident leaves Judau depressed and detached from reality. During the closing months of the first Neo Zeon movement, Judau became convinced that Leina was still alive. While the rest of the crew figured he was delusional and refused to accept the truth, it was his Newtype intuitions that proved him to be true. At the end of the series Judau is reunited with his sister and leaves with Roux to go to the planet Jupiter. In the Gundam Evolve 10 animated short, Judau is assigned to protect/escort the space transport ship Jupitris on his birthday. While on the recovery missions he encounters Neo Zeon forces pursuing an AMX-004-3 Quebeley MK.II. Seeing the Quebeley posing no threat, Judau assists it in destroying the Neo Zeon squad composed of Doven Wolfs riding on sub-flight platforms, allowing the Quebeley to land safely on Jupitris. The last scene seems to reveal that the Quebeley was piloted by someone whose pilot suit resembles the one belonging to Ple Two. ; : : ; : ; : :A friend of Judau who acts as the leader for their Junk Collector group. After joining the AUEG, Beecha at first did not have much faith in the group and tried numerous times with his partner Mondo to prove their loyalty to the Zeon. Eventually the two were allowed to join the crew of the Endra, but after being horribly mistreated and given menial jobs the two escaped to re-join the AEUG, though they failed to take Leina Ashta with them. Afterward Beecha proved his strengthened loyalty to the AUEG by serving as a mobile suit pilot for the repaired Hyaku Shiki. After the group acquired the Nahel Argama, Beecha served as its acting captain for the remainder of the war and then returned to civilian life. ; : : : An A.E.U.G. recruit serving on the Argama, Roux Louka becomes the pilot of Zeta Gundam when Judau Ashta changes over to the ZZ Gundam. A regular soldier and older than Judau and his counterparts, her patronizing attitude towards them initially causes friction, but eventually an unfaltering bond of trust forms between them. Despite feelings enemy pilot Glemy Toto has for her, Roux kills him in their final confrontation. After the war she joins the Jupiter Fleet along with Judau. ; : :Elpeo Ple is an artificially enhanced Newtype, who first appears fighting for Neo-Zeon under Glemy Toto. She pilots the AMX-004-2 Qubeley Mk.II. Her name is a pun on the title of a Japanese hentai magazine, Lemon People, which was popularly referred to as . This is the reason behind the discrepancy between her English name of \\"Elpeo Ple,\\" as given in official Japanese sources, and its actual pronunciation within the series. After an encounter with ZZ Gundam's Newtype pilot, Judau Ashta, she becomes obsessed with him, referring to him as \\"big brother\\". Because of her attachment to Judau she leaves Neo- Zeon to join the AEUG aboard the Argama. Aboard the Argama she is seen as troublesome by the ship's crew, constantly wanting to be with Judau. She dies protecting Judau from Ple Two (Ple Two) who is piloting the MRX-009 Psyco Gundam Mk. II. Her Newtype \\"spirit\\" remains influential however, convincing Ple Two during the Battle of Axis to stop fighting Judau, which in turn leads to the death of Glemy Toto and her clone to join Judau and his friends. ; : :Former captain of White Base during the One Year War and one of the sole experienced military commander within the ranks of AEUG leaders after their costly final battle during the Gryps Conflict. He continues to serve the same role he played in the previous Gundam shows as captain of the Argama, the same ship that he commanded in the fight against the Titans. After the Axis Zeon are defeated, the AEUG forces are integrated back with the Earth Federation, and Bright gets re-instated as an officer of the Earth Federation with the rank of Captain. ; : : ; : :Hayato Kobayashi is a former crew member of the White Base during the One Year War. He is now owner of the Kennedy Space Museum and leader of the Earth-based anti-Titans group, Karaba. His adoptive son, Katz Kobayashi, was killed during the final battle that took place in Zeta Gundam. He pays a visit to his son's quarters on board the Argama before he goes out into battle and is killed by a Zaku III piloted by Neo Zeon ace Rakan Dahkaran, while assisting the AEUG in an attempt to rescue the civilians of Dublin when the Neo Zeon had targeted the city with a Colony Drop. ; : :The AEUG's top mobile suit pilot during their last conflict with the Titans. Throughout most of the series, he remains comatose as a result of a crippling blow from his late adversary Paptimus Scirocco. Near the end of the series, Kamille awakens and again displays the most powerful Newtype abilities, such as telepathically talking to Judau and his crew, much like Amuro Ray did with the White Base crew during the One Year War. Despite this, he is still noticeably under some influence of the attack. Kamille is never shown again to pilot a mobile suit. By the end of Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ, Kamille has apparently recovered his mental faculties and may have found a chance for a peaceful life along with his childhood friend and love interest, Fa Yuiry. They are last seen in the epilogue of ZZ Gundam running along a beach. ; : :After the Gryps Conflict, Fa spent most of her time providing tender care to her beloved boyfriend Kamille, who was psychologically crippled from his final fight with Scirocco (her dedication to Kamille was such that the Haman-crazed Mashymre Cello was impressed enough to describe her as \\"Lady Angel\\"). Fa initially continued her duties as an active member on the Argama, but later chose to retire to be with Kamille on Shangri-La following the Argamas departure after her Methuss was disabled in combat to save Judau Ashta (who rushed out in Zeta Gundam with an unloaded beam rifle) from Mashymre's Hamma Hamma mobile suit. She did not reappear until later in the show, where she was seen working in Dublin as a nurse while still taking care of the mentally incapacitated Kamille. Fa reunites with the Argama crew when they visited Dublin to seek psychiatric assessment for Elpeo Ple, and she appeared in time to rescue Judau and Bright, who were under confinement by the local authority, from a burning basement when Neo Zeon attacked on the Federation building. In the epilogue of the series, Kamille recovers his mental faculties and lives peacefully with Fa, and they are last seen running along a beach together. Antagonists Neo-Zeon (Axis) ; : :After defeating Char, Haman planned to move in and conquer Earth. However, she first had to eliminate the AEUG, since they drained potential support from spacenoids. During this time, she met Judau Ashta, and developed feelings for him, possibly due to his powers and possibly because he reminded her of a younger version of herself. She tried to persuade him to join her but he rebuffed her. During their encounter in Dakar, Haman accidentally injured Leina, causing Judau to become enraged. The ensuing pressure terrified Haman, driving her to leave. She also ordered a colony drop on Dublin; though the AEUG was able to evacuate some people, most of the population died. Eventually, Glemmy Toto initiated a civil war just as she was on the verge of triumph. Haman won, but the war gave the Earth forces precious time to regroup. Haman and Judau faced off in a final battle, during which both incapacitated the other. Despite Judau's entreaties, Haman ultimately committed suicide, her last words expressing happiness that she had met someone as good as Judau. ; : : ; : :The captain of the Neo Zeon ship \\"The Endora\\". He is always seen wearing a flower that Haman Khan gave to him, as he is borderline obsessed with her. Mashymre is depicted as possessing strong newtype abilities. He is the primary antagonist at the beginning of the series, however a series of defeats at the hands of Judau Ashta and the AEUG result in control of the Endora to be handed over to Chara Soon.He does not appear again until the colony drop on Dublin, for which he is responsible. Although still dedicated to Haman, by this point he has largely abandoned his pacifistic and idealistic concepts (although comments by other characters suggest this may be the result of psychological conditioning and/or attempts to turn him into an artificial newtype), and has adapted a colder, more destitute outlook towards battle. He fights for Haman at the Battle of Axis against the rebel forces of Glemy Toto. Mashymre dies while fighting Rakan Dahkaran and his Doven Wolf team during the Battle of Axis. After displaying an impressive amount of newtype powers he detonates his mobile suit. ; : :A female commander that has an unstable personality. Chara's mood swings are so constant that she sometimes goes out of control in a mobile suit battle. Chara first appeared in the series as an observer for Mashymre Cello and was later assigned to replace him as the Endra's captain due to his constant failures against the Argama. After being captured by the AEUG, Chara was forced to serve as a cleaning lady much too her disgust under the watch of the two children Shinta and Qum until she was able to escape. Chara later returns around the end of the series having apparently becoming a cyber-Newtype and later fights alongside Haman's forces against Glemy's forces where she ultimately dies in a newtype flash and taking a number of Qubeley Mk. II units down with her. ; :Voiced by: Tsutomu Kashiwakura|Jordan Schartner (English, Dynasty Warriors Gundam games)}} : ; : : ; : : ; : : Other characters ; : : ; : : ; : : ; : : ; : :Several days after the Battle of Gryps ended, Yazan's escape pod was recovered at Shangri-La Colony by Judau Ashta and his gang. Yazan then attempted and succeeded in coercing them into stealing the Zeta Gundam. Over the next several days Yazan made several attempts to steal the Zeta and failed each time. In the end, the Zeta and the Argama escaped the colony and Yazan is last seen attempting to escape by parachuting with a jacket. In a later episode, he is seen in a cameo appearance during a black tie dinner party on Earth.

Victory Gundam is well known for its extremely high casualty rate on both sides in the conflict that takes place in this show. League Militaire ; √úso Ewin : : Being 13 years old, √úso is the youngest Universal Century Gundam protagonist to date. Many fans of the Gundam series believe Ewin to be the great-grandson of another character, Char Aznable; this is due to the last name of Ewin's mother being \\"Miguel\\", being the same as Char's last lover, Nanai Miguel from Char's Counterattack. The time frame (sixty years had passed between both series) also gives the theory some weight; however, Yoshiyuki Tomino, creator of the Gundam series has denied such a theory as being true, though the production group planned to use this idea. : √úso is an illegal immigrant on Earth at Point Kasarelia, and eventually ends up joining the League Militaire in fending off the Zanscare Empire, when the soldiers ruthlessly slaughtered many innocent civilians in Woowig. He is the pilot of the Victory Gundam, and subsequently the Victory 2 Gundam. √úso is constantly left scarred by the reality of war, and the people that keep dying to protect him and their cause. √úso is good friends with Shakti Karin, the daughter of Zanscare Queen Maria Pia Armonia. According to √úso, the name of his and Shakti's hometown, Kasarelia, means \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye\\" in a Northern Pacific language. The word eventually becomes somewhat of a rallying call for them. √úso also makes enemies with Chronicle Asher, Shakti's uncle and Queen Maria's younger brother. The two form somewhat of an Amuro Ray/Char Aznable rivalry. ; Shakti Kareen : :Shakti is a 11 year old illegal Earth immigrant that shares a close bond with √úso. She is a caring person that has trouble adjusting to the realities of war that constantly surround her. Her caring personality can be seen as she takes care of the orphaned baby Karlmann. Shakti tries to reason with members of Zanscare to show them the error of the ways and as a result, is constantly kidnapped. She is the daughter of Zanscare's Queen Maria and the niece of √úso's main rival, Cronicle Asher. ; Marbet Fingerhat : :Marbet is one of League Milataire's mobile suit pilots. She is usually calm and caring and does not normally show anger, but can be very opinionated. Marbet was originally designated to be the Victory Gundam's pilot, but she suffered a leg injury during a battle before the Gundam could be completed. Once the Victory becomes mass produced, Marbet pilots one of the units alongside √úso and Oliver. She initially dislikes Oliver, referring to him as a pimp, but the two eventually marry and she becomes pregnant with his child. ; Suzy Relane : :Suzy is an orphaned child and the younger sister of Odelo. Her parents were executed via guillotine by the Zanscare Empire. She usually helps Shakti take care of Karlmann. ; Tomache Massarik : :Tomache is a 17 year old cadet for the League Militaire. His father, Batstraff, was a worker at the orbital energy satellite Hiland. Tomache was captured by BESPA forces along with other children from Hiland, before being rescued by √úso and Marbet. Like Odelo, he originally had more of a support role before becoming a mobile suit pilot. Tomache's ultimate fate in the series is unknown and he is presumed to have been killed in the final battle as he does not reappear after the battle. ; Oliver Inoue : :Oliver is the leader of the League Militaire's Shrike Team. He pilots one of the Victory Gundam units alongside √úso and Marbet. He marries Marbet and the two have a child that is born at the war's end. Oliver is killed when he detached his Core Fighter and rammed it into a battleship. ; Muller Miguel : :Muller is √úso's mother and Hangelg's wife. She is an engineer who works for what is left of Anaheim Electronics and develops the Victory 2 \\"V2\\" Gundam for her son. She is killed in a battle after a Zanscare ship explodes with the debris decapitating her. ; Hangelg Ewin : :Hangelg is √úso's father and Muller's husband. He is one of the founders and leader of the League Militaire, the rebel group that stands in opposition to the Zanscare Empire as the Earth Federation was severely weakened and stagnant at the time of the invasion. ; Jinn Geneham : :Jinn is a member of the League Militaire who acts as the organization's leader in Hangelg's place and is the captain of the Reinforce Junior. ; Romero Marabal : ; Odelo Henrik : :Odelo is the older brother of Suzy and acts as an older brother figure to √úso and Warren. His parents were executed via guillotine by the Zanscare Empire. Odelo initially acts in a support role for the League Militaire before becoming a mobile suit pilot. He is killed in the final battle by Katejina. ; Yuca Meilasch :  Shrike Team  The Shrike Team is an all-female mobile suit squadron founded by Oliver Inoe, one of the Victory Gundam pilots, and later lead by Junko Jenko. The team operates as part of the League Militaire. Several of the members are named after female singers. ; Helen Jackson : :Helen is one of the Shrike Team's pilots. She is killed while trying to defend a League Militaire aircraft. ; Mahalia Merrill : :Mahalia is one of the Shrike Team's pilots. She was orphaned at an early age when her parents and brother died in an accident. Eager to avenge Helen's death, Mahalia accidentally causes a battle to break out in the neutral Arti Gibraltar after brandishing her Gun-EZ's beam rifle in front of BESPA forces. She is killed in the ensuing battle after her suit is damaged and the cockpit explodes. ; Kate Bush : :Kate is one of the Shrike Team's pilots. During the battle at Arti Gibraltar Kate holds up the damaged rail of the spaceport's mass driver so that a shuttle could take off. This leaves her vulnerable and her suit is struck in the cockpit by Kwan Lee, killing her. ; Peggy Lee : :Peggy is one of the Shrike Team's pilots. She becomes injured after her Gun-EZ is damaged in the battle following the surprise attack on Zanscare's capitol at Amelia. She uses her heavily damaged mobile suit to help √úso and the others re-enter the colony, but she becomes involved in a fight with Cronicle Asher, who kills her during the battle. ; Junko Jenko : : Junko is one of the Shrike Team's pilots and becomes its leader after joining the crew of the Reinforce. Her fighting style tends to be reckless, which often worries her comrades. She has somewhat of a rivalry with Marbet due to the affection the two have for Oliver. Junko dies near the middle of the war, being caught in an explosion by a bomb that Cronicle Asher planted inside the Kelias Guilie's Big Cannon. ; Francesca O'Hara : ; Miliera Katan : ; Cony Francis : ;Juca Meilasch : ;Miliera Katan : Zanscare Empire ;Katejina Loos : : is a strong-willed seventeen-year-old girl from the fictional European city Woowig. Separated from her parents around the time of the destruction of her home town by the invading BESPA forces of the Zanscare Empire, Katejina joins the League Militaire with young √úso Ewin; however, Katejina disapproves of the League's reliance on √úso as a Gundam pilot due to the mounting toll on his young body and mind. Katejina is captured by Lt. Chronicle Asher and taken to the Zanscare Empire, where she becomes Chronicle's personal assistant. Later, she is trained as a soldier and becomes a mobile suit ace; it is during this period that her attraction to Chronicle, and hatred of √úso, begins to grow. Her personal support for Maria's matriarchal ideals, her annoyance at √úso's continual attempts to interfere with what she views as her true happiness, and her sheer admiration for Chronicle turn her into a dangerous Zanscare loyalist. She and √úso battle on several occasions, where she succeeds in killing several members of the Strike Team and Odelo Henrik in the process. However, she ultimately loses her memory while fighting √úso during the Battle of Angel Halo. After √úso defeats her in this battle, Katejina suffers severe brain damage: she loses her sight and her memories, and suffers irreversible mental damage from the fight. She is last seen wandering the streets as a beggar, homeless and forgotten. Despite his predilection for killing off several main characters during the final phases of his shows, producer Yoshiyuki Tomino allowed Katejina to live, saying \\"life was a heavier punishment for her.\\" :Katejina is a playable character in Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 2 and Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3 with her mobile suit Gottrlatan. ;Cronicle Asher : :Cronicle Asher is one of Zanscare's top pilots and one of the main antagonists in the series. He quickly forms a rivalry with √úso early on as √úso ejects him from his Shokew mobile suit and takes control of it. This event leaves him feeling humiliated and he is determined to recover the Shokew from √úso. Asher has a code of honor of sorts, and usually will not engage with non-combatants such as civilians and children. He disapproves of his fellow soldiers that bomb and destroy an area to draw out just one mobile suit, but will follow when a superior officer gives the exact same orders. Like most of Zanscare's remaining members, he is killed during the final battle. He is the younger brother of Queen Maria and the uncle of Shakti. ;Fonse Kagatie : :Fonse Kagatie is the de-facto leader of the Zanscare Empire, using Queen Maria as a figurehead to further his own ideals. Kagatie oversees Zanscare's military operations and is in charge of the miliary branch BESPA. Formerly a member of the Jupiter Fleet, he is responsible for most of Zanscare's more radical policies, such as exiling people into space and using the guillotine for executions. ;Duker Iq : ;Lupe Cineau : ;Goze Baru : ;Fuala Griffon : ;Tassilo Vago : ;Arbeo Pippinden : ;Queen Maria Pure Armonia : :Maria Pure Armonia is the leader of the Zanscare Empire, mother of Shakti, and the older sister of Cronicle Asher. She believes in a matriarchal society and sees most of the world's problems having been caused by men. Originally living in poverty, Maria became wealthy after learning she had the ability to heal people. Maria is essentially a figurehead for Zanscare, with Fonse Kagatie being the empire's de-facto leader. She is double-crossed and killed by Tassilo Vago during the final battle.

The Foul√©es du Gois is an international road running race held annually on the Passage du Gois, a tidal causeway between Beauvoir-sur- Mer and the √éle de Noirmoutier, France. The professional race, held over the submerged causeway, is from one end of the causeway to the other, a distance of . A series of alternate races are undertaken earlier in the day, when the tide is not over the causeway, for youth and non-professional divisions; the adult non-elite divisions are in length, a round trip of the Passage du Gois. The event is the second-most publicised in the d√©partement of Vend√©e, after the Vend√©e Globe round-the-world yacht race. Racing history and records The idea for a race on the Passage du Gois was conceived in the late stages of 1986, with Jo Cesbron the founding president of the 'Foul√©es du Gois'. The first event was held on June 20, 1987. The race takes place annually in early summer, most frequently in the month of June, due to the logistics of tide heights, daylight hours, and water temperatures; the race generally starts in the evening. The professional race, which is limited to 30 competitors selected from French and international applicants, begins when the water first crosses the road. The leaders often finish with water up to their ankles, while those who have got caught in the rising swell are often forced to swim to the finish line. The current record for the race is 12 minutes and 8 seconds, by French athlete and Olympian Dominique Chauvelier in the 1990 running of the event. Conditions and geography The Passage du Gois is at the convergence point of two water currents; the Bay of Bourgneuf current to the left of the runners and the Fromentine current to right. The athletes use the wave caused by this meeting as a path, as it provides less resistance to wading compared to undisturbed water. However, at high tide, the Bay of Bourgneuf current is stronger than the Fromentine current, and the wave line alters its course off the causeway. The height of the water at high tide varies between and .

Starting his career in Viborg FF, Mensah later moved to Esbjerg fB before joining Br√∏ndby in 2017. Originally a forward, Mensah transitioned into a utility player while at Br√∏ndby, starting out as a striker but later becoming a full- back due to a shortage of available players on the position. Under head coach Niels Frederiksen, Mensah has been utilised at both right and left wing-back, where his agility and attacking mentality have come to their right. In July 2019, he was appointed new vice-captain of the club. Mensah has made appearances for various national youth teams of Denmark while at Viborg, gaining 26 total caps in which he scored four goals. Career Viborg FF Mensah played his first years of youth football for S√∏ndermarkens IK in his hometown Viborg. When he was 15 he signed with Viborg FF after being part of talent project FK Viborg.Viborg sikrer sig stortalent Fodboldnyt.com, 18. oktober 2006 In 2008, he trained regularly with the Danish Superliga squad for Viborg FF, and on 2 May 2009, at 17 years of age, he scored his first goal for the team, in a 2-0 win over Thisted FC in the Danish second tier.17 √•rig sikrer Viborg FF sejr over TFC DR Midt/Vest 2 May 2009 The day before his 18th birthday, he was permanently promoted to the first team.Mensah rykkes op i A-truppen Viborg FF ‚Äì officiel site He had previously been on trial at Premier League clubs Arsenal and Newcastle United for several laps despite his young age.Player profile VFF.dk On 30 June 2011, his contract with Viborg FF expired, and a few days before he went on a trial with FC Nordsj√¶lland without this materialising in a contract offer. Therefore, Mensah returned to Viborg FF to keep his physical shape straight together with former teammates. When he still had not received any offers from clubs at the beginning of the next season, he started playing as an amateur for Viborg FF. In August 2011, the club offered him a new professional contract, which meant that he signed a two-year deal with the Viborg FF in October 2011.Viborg F.F. skriver med Kevin Mensah Viborg FF, accessed 10 May 2019 After Viborg FF reached promotion to the Superliga in 2013, Mensah signed another two-year contact extension keeping him in his hometown club until 30 June 2015. Esbjerg fB On 2 February 2015 Esbjerg fB signed Mensah. Originally, he would transfer to Esbjerg in the summer of 2015. However, Viborg and Esbjerg reached an agreement on a transfer on the last day of the January transfer window, as Viborg had found a replacement for him in the meantime.Kevin Mensah skifter omg√•ende til EfB, efb.dk, 2 Februar 2015.

Br√∏ndby IF On 23 January 2017, Br√∏ndby IF confirmed that they had reached an agreement with Esbjerg for the transfer of Mensah. In the last match of the 2017‚Äì18 season, Mensah suffered a torn ACL, ruling him out for seven to nine months following surgery on his knee. After making his return in February 2019, and following the departure of right back Johan Larsson to EA Guingamp, Br√∏ndby manager Alexander Zorniger opted to move Mensah to right back to accommodate the shortage of backs in the squad, which meant that he would serve as the backup to Jens Martin Gammelby. Due to Anthony Jung's poor form at left back, Mensah was utilised in this position too in the 2018‚Äì19 season with great success. In July 2019, he was appointed new vice-captain of the club. Playing style Mensah plays the ball with both his right-foot and left-foot, and has been described as a technical marvel, an elegant offensive player with a wonderful technique that makes him a crowd favorite in addition of a footspeed that makes him uncomfortable to handle for any defender.

Biography Willie Kavanaugh Hocker was born in Madison County, Kentucky. Her father was a farmer and planter. She and her family moved to Arkansas in 1870. After obtaining a certificate to teach in 1887, Hocker taught school in Wabbaseka. Hocker died at home in Jefferson County on February 6, 1944, at the age of 81. Flag of Arkansas Hocker flag proposal (1912) Hocker was a member of the Pine Bluff chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Her chapter wanted to present the newly commissioned with a state flag; however the chapter was informed that a state flag did not exist at all. Hocker, along with other citizens, sent flag designs to Earle W. Hodges, who was the Secretary of State. She proposed a red flag with a white diamond surrounded by a border of blue, 25 white stars in the blue and three blue stars inside the white diamond. The flag design committee suggested adding the name \\"Arkansas\\" to the flag. Hocker agreed; thus the first design of the state flag was born. After some changes to add a fourth blue star to the flag, to represent Arkansas's membership in the Confederate States, the final design was set in 1924.

It was developed by Factor 5 and published by LucasArts in North America, CTO SpA in Europe, and Bullet-Proof Software in Japan. It was released on March 31, 1997 in North America and in October 1997 in Europe. It is a remake of the 1984 video game Ballblazer that was released for the Commodore 64 and Atari 800 computers.  Plot  A one thousand year feud between four races - the Kraytons, the Mandalars, the Thilibies and the Zaitecs is planned to be settled by a Ballblazer knock-out tournament. Each race enters two of their best rotofoil pilots to take part in a series 1v1 matches with the victor being crowned \\"Master Ballblazer\\". The race that wins overall gains control over the galaxy. Gameplay The game takes place on an asteroid where an intergalactic BallBlazer competition is taking place, featuring creatures coming from throughout the galaxy. The player selects from one of eight characters, each with their own unique ship called a rotofoil. Each has differing stats in speed, handling, launcher and energy. Players travel around an arena in their rotofoils, armed with various weaponry, similar to the 1975 film Rollerball. The object is to score goals by shooting glowing balls known as \\"plasmorbs\\" with the rotofoil into the goal. The winner of each round is the first to score five goals. At the same time, opponents use their weapons to prevent goals from being scored. When a ship has possession of the ball, the energy used to maintain its top speed drains. Reception The game received a wide range of opinions from reviewers. Adam Douglas from IGN said that \\"For fans of the original game, BallBlazer Champions offers a nostalgic update. But for everyone else, stick to the normal sports.\\" Trent Ward from GameSpot stated that \\"it's obvious that LucasArts has devoted some serious time to making a conversion title that takes full advantage of the PlayStation high-speed graphics engine\\". He added that the play controls take a little getting used to. Ward's biggest praise about the game was with the multiplayer mode, which he says adds to the game's replay value. A Next Generation critic similarly described it as \\"A good one- player game, but even better with two players.\\" Contrarily, GamePro said that \\"Even though it has an interesting premise, BBC ultimately rockets its way into the 'who cares' bin.\\" Shawn Smith of Electronic Gaming Monthly said \\"The different play modes were fun (my personal favorite being freeplay) and the competition was pretty fierce at times.\\", while his co-reviewer Dan Hsu said that \\"The choppy and speedy animation combined with the loose controls make the game very difficult to follow, especially in the two-player mode.\\" The most widely praised aspect of the graphics was the lighting effects. Several critics found the game's sound uninspired. Another common complaint was that the arenas are too large, frequently resulting in situations where the two players simply drive around in isolation from each other. The game was named the Best Multi-Player Game of the Year in PSExtreme Magazine's 1997 Extreme Awards.

The region of Beth Garmai (Syriac: ) is situated in northern Iraq, bounded by the Little Zab and Diyala Rivers and centered on the town of Karka d'Beth Slokh (Syriac: , modern Kirkuk). Several bishops and metropolitans of Beth Garma√Ø are mentioned between the fourth and fourteenth centuries, residing first at Shahrgard, then at Karka d'Beth Slokh, later at Shahrzur and finally at Daquqa. The known suffragan dioceses of the metropolitan province of Beth Garma√Ø included Shahrgard, Lashom (), Khanijar, Mahoze d'Arewan (), Radani, Hrbath Glal (), Tahal and Shahrzur. The suffragan dioceses of 'Darabad' and 'al-Qabba', mentioned respectively by Eliya of Damascus and Mari, are probably to be identified with one or more of these known dioceses. The diocese of Gawka√Ø, attested in the eighth and ninth centuries, may also have been a suffragan diocese of the province of Beth Garma√Ø. The last known metropolitan of Beth Garma√Ø is attested in the thirteenth century, and the last known bishop in 1318, though the historian Amr continued to describe Beth Garmai as a metropolitan province as late as 1348. It is not clear when the province ceased to exist, but the campaigns of Timur Leng between 1390 and 1405 offer a reasonable context.  Background  Before the fourteenth century the Kirkuk region was included in the East Syriac metropolitan province of Beth Garma√Ø, one of the five great 'provinces of the interior' of the Church of the East. The bishop of Karka d‚ÄôBeth Slokh was recognised as metropolitan of Beth Garma√Ø in Canon XXI of the synod of Isaac in 410. He ranked sixth in precedence (after the metropolitan bishops of Seleucia, Beth Lapat, Nisibis, Prath d'Maishan and Erbil), and was responsible for the suffragan dioceses of Shahrgard, Lashom, Arewan, Radani and Hrbath Glal.Chabot, 272‚Äì3 There were several suffragan dioceses in the province of Beth Garma√Ø at different periods. Within Beth Garma√Ø itself (the region between the Lesser Zab and Diyala rivers) there were dioceses for Radani, Shahrgard, Lashom, Shahrzur and Tirhan. All of these dioceses except Tirhan (an outlying diocese in the province of the patriarch) were in the province of Beth Garmai. The dioceses of Hrbath Glal and Mahoze d‚ÄôArewan in the Lesser Zab valley were geographically in the Erbil region but seem to have been included in the metropolitan province of Beth Garma√Ø. The seat of the bishops of Mahoze d'Arewan was later transferred to the nearby town of Konishabur, also known as Beth Waziq, and this diocese still had a bishop in 1318. Within the Beth Garma√Ø region proper, however, only the metropolitan diocese of Daquqa and the diocese of Tirhan (the district between the Tigris and Jabal Hamrin) in the province of the patriarch seem to have survived into the fourteenth century. The last-known bishop of Tirhan, Shemon, was present at the consecration of Timothy II in 1318, and the diocese may have met its end during Timur's campaigns in the 1390s. No further bishops are recorded in the Kirkuk region until the early years of the nineteenth century, when a Catholic diocese of Kirkuk (which persists to this day) was established in the 1820s by the patriarchal administrator Augustine Hindi. Later in the nineteenth century a second Catholic diocese was established for the Sehna region in Persia, hitherto part of the diocese of Kirkuk. Eliya of Damascus listed five suffragan dioceses in the 'eparchy of Bajarmi' in 893, in the following order: Shahrqadat (Shahrgard); Daquqa; al-Bawazikh (Beth Waziq); Darabad; and Khanijar and Lashom.Assemani, BO, ii. 485‚Äì9 The diocese of 'al-Qabba' in the province of Beth Garma√Ø, not attested elsewhere, is said to have been 'added to Wasit' (i.e. transferred to the province of the patriarch) during the reign of the patriarch Abdisho I (963‚Äì86), in exchange for the diocese of al- Bawazikh (Beth Waziq).Mari, 104 (Arabic), 92 (Latin)  The diocese of Karka d'Beth Slokh  The bishop Yohannan of Beth Garma√Ø was present at the Council of Nicaea in 325.Fiey, POCN, 63 The bishops Shapur and Isaac of Beth Garma√Ø are mentioned in connection with the persecution of Shapur II (339‚Äì79).Fiey, POCN, 63 The bishop Aqballaha, 'bishop of Karka and metropolitan of Beth Garma√Ø', was present at the synod of Isaac in 410 and subscribed to its acts.Chabot, 273‚Äì4 He was also among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Dadisho in 424.Chabot, 285 The bishop Yohannan, 'bishop of Karka d'Beth Slokh, metropolitan of Beth Garma√Ø', was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Acacius in 486.Chabot, 306 The deacon and secretary Hormizd was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Baba√Ø in 497, on behalf of the metropolitan Bokhtisho of Beth Garma√Ø.Chabot, 315 The bishop Dairaya of Karka d'Beth Slokh, 'metropolitan of this town and of all the country of Beth Garma√Ø', was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Mar Aba I in 544.Chabot, 344‚Äì5 and 350‚Äì1 The metropolitan Allaha-zkha of Beth Garma√Ø adhered by letter to the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554.Chabot, 366 The metropolitan Bokhtisho of Beth Garma√Ø adhered by letter to the acts of the synod of Ishoyahb I in 585.Chabot, 424 The metropolitan Bokhtisho of Beth Garma√Ø, perhaps the same man, was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Gregory in 605.Chabot, 478 The monk Gabriel of the monastery of Beth Abe was consecrated metropolitan of Beth Garma√Ø by the patriarch Sliba-zkha (714‚Äì28).

contemporary of Thomas of Marga and flourished around the middle of the ninth century.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 564  Bishops of unspecified dioceses  The monks Burdisho, Quriaqos, Baba√Ø and Isho of the monastery of Beth Abe were bishops of various dioceses in the province of Beth Garma√Ø at an unknown date in the second half of the eighth century or the first half of the ninth century.Wallis Budge, Book of Governors, ii. 448  Topographical Survey  The Beth Garma√Ø region seems to have been at its most flourishing in the sixth and seventh centuries. A number of its towns, villages and monasteries, many unlocalised, are mentioned in several pre-fourteenth century sources, notably Thomas of Marga's Book of Governors and Ishodnah's Book of Chastity. These sources mention the districts of Beth Mshaynane, Beth Gawaya, Hasa and Resha; the towns of Karka d'Beth Slokh (Kirkuk), Daquqa, Lashom (modern Lashin), Khanijar (all at one time or another the seats of East Syriac bishops) and Karkh Guddan; the monasteries of Mar Shubhalmaran and Mar Ezekiel near Daquqa; and the villages of Kafra, Luz, Shabrug (or Shaqrug) and Zark. Few of these communities are mentioned after the eleventh century, and only two seem to have survived into the fourteenth century. The celebrated monastery of Mar Ezekiel near the town of Daquqa was visited by the monks Rabban Sawma and Marqos in 1280, and is almost certainly to be identified with the monastery of Mar Ezekiel 'in the region of Babylon' mentioned in the report of 1610.Wallis Budge, The Monks of Kublai Khan, 142‚Äì3 An East Syriac community seems also to have survived in Kirkuk itself, next mentioned in the sixteenth century. Isolated East Syriac communities also persisted around Sehna, a rare survival beyond the Urmi region of historic East Syriac Christianity in Persia, and in Baghdad, once the seat of the East Syriac patriarchs. Towards the end of the eighteenth century the historic diocese of Beth Garma√Ø was revived with the establishment of the Chaldean diocese of Kirkuk in 1789. For much of the nineteenth century the East Syriac communities of Sehna and Baghdad were included in the Chaldean diocese of Kirkuk.  References  Citations Bibliography  Assemani, J.

Broadside versions Versions of the ballad first appeared shortly after the rising sung by street pedlars and there are several broadside songs printed. These typically include the phrase \\"500 Guineas\\" or \\"one thousand pounds\\", and are also sung to the tune of the old Irish air Cail√≠n √ìg a St√≥r. They may be the basis for the later ballad, Lady Franklin's Lament. Malone version Charlotte Schreiber's painting The Croppy Boy (The Confession of an Irish Patriot) A version by Carroll Malone first appeared in the Irish newspaper The Nation in 1845 and tells of a young man who stops in a church on his way to fight. He sees a cloaked figure in a confessional and kneels for the penitential rite. The figure is actually a British soldier who sought refuge from rebels by hiding in the confessional. After the youth completes his confession, the soldier reveals himself and proceeds to arrest the youth and take him to prison and execution. The legend is the subject of Canadian artist Charlotte Schreiber's painting The Croppy Boy (The Confession of an Irish Patriot), now in the National Gallery of Canada.

The town was located in the wilderness of Judah, otherwise known as the Judean Desert, and is identified by some scholars with the archaeological site of Khirbet Qumran. Ancient name The toponym Secacah is derived from the root ◊°◊õ◊ö, which means either ‚Äúenclosed‚Äù or ‚Äúcover‚Äù (possibly in reference to a shaded area).Refer to L. K√∂hler, and W. Baumgartner. The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament. Study edition. Vol. 1. (New York: Brill, 2001), p. 754, s.v. ◊°◊õ◊ö I and III The variation in the spelling of the place name, ◊°◊õ◊õ◊î in the Hebrew Bible versus ◊°◊õ◊õ◊ê in the Copper Scroll, reflects an orthographic phenomenon seen elsewhere in later phases of Hebrew (◊ê < ◊î). In the Greek versions of the Hebrew Bible, Secacah is transcribed as Œ£ŒøœáŒøœáŒ± in LXX-A but is written AŒπœáŒπoŒ∂a in LXX-B. In the latter source (LXX-B), however, the place names of seem to have been corrupted. References in Biblical and Post-biblical sources Secacah is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, , as part of the Tribe of Judah's inheritance. The roster of towns in Joshua 15 is commonly thought to reflect an administrative document that originated during the Kingdom of Judah. This list divides the Iron Age kingdom into four regions, the Shephelah, the Negeb, the wilderness, and the highlands; Secacah is listed in the wilderness along with the City of Salt and the better known town of En-gedi.Y. Aharoni, M. Avi- Yonah, et al. The Carta Bible Atlas Corrected 4th edition (New York: Macmillan, 2002) Although Secacah is only listed once in the Hebrew Bible, it is mentioned several times in the Copper Scroll, 3Q15 4-5, in reference to the hiding places of the treasures mentioned in this document. The description of Secacah includes a dam and an aqueduct (3Q15 4:13 and 5:1-3) and associates the place with Jericho (3Q15 5:13). Location and identification The water system at Qumran. The town of Secacah is listed along with six other towns and related settlements in the wilderness of Judah, situated along the western bank of the Dead Sea and commonly known as the Judean Desert. Frank Moore Cross Jr. and J√≥zef Milik located Secacah at the archaeological site of Khirbet es-Samrah in the Buq√™‚Äôah, a valley in the Judean Desert.Cross, F. M., and J. T. Milik. \\"Explorations in the Judaean Buq√™'ah.\\" Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 142 (1956): 5‚Äì17. The basis for this identification was the fact that es-Samrah was an Iron Age settlement that was in the same area as Secacah (the wilderness of Judah). John Marco Allegro, however, identified Khirbet Qumran (nearby the Buq√™‚Äôah) with Secacah.Allegro, J. M. The Treasure of the Copper Scroll (Garden City: Doubleday, 1960) p. 68 Although it is most famous as the archaeological site where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, excavations have revealed that Qumran was initially inhabited during the Iron Age. The Iron Age remains found there include a LMLK seal (similar to the one found by Cross and Milik at es-Samrah). In addition, the water system at Qumran, which dates to the early Roman Period, is consistent with the description of Secacah in the Copper Scroll.Eshel, H. \\"A Note on Joshua 15:61‚Äì62 and the Identification of the City of Salt\\" Israel Exploration Journal; 45 (1995): 37‚Äì40.

The bomber killed at least seven people and injured 91. Attack The bomber drove his automobile undetected through three or fewer police-checkpoints before detonating his explosive payload, estimated as variously and , from the main gate of the NATO base. The attack, coming five days before the country's presidential elections, was the first major attack in the capital since February. Aftermath The attack wounded 91 people and immediately killed seven civilians, though doctors stated that some patients were in danger of succumbing to injuries later on. Casualties among the military were stated to have been avoided by ISAF Brigadier General Eric Tremblay, though he would not give details. The Taliban claimed differently, stating that they had destroyed four vehicles and killed 24 US embassy employees. Among those wounded was parliament member, Awa Alam Nuristani, and a female campaign manager for President Hamid Karzai. After the attacks Karzai declared that \\"the enemies of Afghanistan, by conducting such attacks, are trying to create fear among the people as we get close to the election, but people still realise the importance of going to ballot boxes to cast their votes.\\" The attack was claimed by a Taliban spokesperson to have been carried out as a method to disrupt the country's second election. The spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, stated that, \\"One of our suicide bombers in a (Toyota Hilux) Surf vehicle packed with 500 kilograms of explosives targeted the ISAF headquarters... We will continue this kind of operation in the future and we will accelerate our operations against the Afghan and foreign forces.\\" The blast occurred in one of the city's most heavily guarded streets, which runs between the United States Embassy and the presidential palace. The blast did not affect them, nor did it cause substantial damage to the NATO headquarters. It was the first attack on the NATO compound since its construction in 2002. The incident marked the beginning of a wave of intimidation by unknown perpetrators, mostly spread by telephone calls and text messaging, warning Afghans not to participate in polling at risk of being killed and targeted alongside foreign forces.

Ettore Conti of Verampio, Count of Verampio OML, OMRI, OCI (1871-1972, Milan, Kingdom of Italy) was an Italian senator, industrialist, and aristocrat.  Biography  Ettore Conti of Verampio was born on April 24, 1871 in Milan. The count taught Construction Sciences at the Polytechnic University of Milan, and dedicated himself to the development of Italy's growing electrical industry. In 1901 The Count of Verampio founded the Conti & Co Electrical Company, the first in Italy to carry out the large scale transport of electricity to households across the country, it did so using large waterfalls and water basins. Category:1871 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Italian engineers Category:Presidents of Confindustria Category:20th-century Italian businesspeople From 1918 to 1919 the count served as the Undersecretary for the Liquidation of Weapons and Munitions at the Ministry of the Treasury. In 1919 Conti became a Conservative Party Senator appointed by Vittorio Emanuele III. Conti also presided over the Italian Caucasus Campaign, he was also a key participant in the Genoa Conference. Conti directed Confindustria, an industrial association between the renowned oil and energy companies, AGIP and Ch√¢tillon. Conti retired from his position as owner of the Conti Electricity Company and became the president of the newly formed AGIP (Italian National Gas Company), a position he left after only two years, citing the numerous corporate positions assumed in the interest of the BCI (Banca Commerciale Italiana) as the reason for his departure. Conti was given a knighthood in 1931 in recognition of his industrial achievements for the Kingdom of Italy.  Involvement in Fascism  Conti Joined the National Fascist Party in 1932 and strongly adhered to the political purposes of the regime, however he was undoubtedly critical towards the adherence to some important economic policy choices. Due to his friendship with Benito Mussolini, Conti was one of the few people to criticise him without fear of punishment or death. Conti enjoyed particular consideration from the Duce, so much so that in 1928 Mussolini asked Conti to accompany his daughter Edda Mussolini during the 11th cruise of the Italian Naval League in India, in the hopes that his wife the Countess of Casati would help educate his daughter. Conti had extensive meetings and conversations with Hermann G√∂ring and Adolf Hitler in Berlin at the International Chamber of Commerce conference, he continued to maintain ties with a number of Nazi leaders throughout the war. In 1938 Conti was made the Extraordinary Ambassador of the Italian Economic Mission in Japan and Manchukuo, this was done to build commercial relationships with the Italy's new Asian allies. On the date of his inauguration Conti signed the treaties of alliance alongside the Italian Ambassador Giacinto Auriti and the Japanese General Kazushige Ugaki. In 1945 Conti was found innocent of having committed any war crimes and was later made president of the Rotary Club of Italy for his life achievements and philanthropy.  Death  The Count of Verampio passed away as a result of natural causes on December 13, 1972 in Milan at his Palazzo, La Casa degli Atellani.

Early siphuncle segments, in the juvenile phragmocone are suborthochoantic; later segments, in the mature phragmocone, become cyrtochoanitic, nummuloidal, broader than long. Parietal deposits lining the interior of the siphuncle grow more prominently forward than backward, with canals slightly anterior of segment centers. Thick cameral deposits develop ventrally, but are only thin dorsally (Sweet, 1964).

Kahn. It followed the groundbreaking 1937 Western musical film Harlem on the Prairie. Plot Bob Blake (Herb Jeffries) and his sidekick Rusty (Lucius Brooks) are two cowboys riding across the countryside in search of adventure. They come across a ranch where it appears a murder has taken place but they find the victim of the crime, Jim Dennison (Leonard Christmas), still alive. Dennison is hiding in fear of his life after what had taken place at the ranch. Bob sees a picture of the rancher's daughter Margaret (Artie Young) and falls in love at first sight; he cannot stop talking about how beautiful the girl in the picture is. Bob drops a glove when he leaves the ranch, which causes problems later. The villain, Bradley (Clarence Brooks), wants to seize the ranch after terrorizing Dennison. Bob sets out to save Margaret and narrowly escapes a plot to frame him for the murder of one of the ranch foremen, Jim Connors (Tom Southern). Bradley uses Bob's dropped glove as part of the frameup. Bob is sent to jail, but is able to escape and tries to find Margaret. After a fight, Bob saves Margaret and they enjoy the romantic moment Bob had imagined when he first saw her picture. The ranch is saved; the story ends with Bob and Margaret together at last, and Bradley put in his place. Cast *Herb Jeffries as Bob Blake *Lucius Brooks as Dusty *F.E.

His main interests were in economics and politics, but he also published poetry. Early life Wilson was born at Ravensworth in the North Riding of Yorkshire, one of at least five sons to Joseph Wilson (born c.1734) and his wife Jane Hutchinson. Some of his relations had farmed under the Earl of Effingham, which resulted in Wilson's distinctive Christian name.Full text of \\"In memory of Effingham Wilson\\" \\"His earliest years were most happily passed in the neighbourhood of the place of his birth\\" according to his biography.

By Loren Kruge Other publications included works by William Godwin, Benjamin Disraeli and Robert Owen. After having been a passenger on the first train into London he founded Railway Magazine, the first railway-themed trade journal.

In 1830 Wilson published Tennyson's Poems Chiefly Lyrical which contained \\"Claribel\\", \\"The Kraken\\", \\"The Dying Swan\\" and \\"Mariana\\", which later took their place among Tennyson's most celebrated poems. The publication brought Tennyson to the notice of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, among others. In 1848 Wilson wrote and published a pamphlet entitled A House for Shakespeare in which he proposed the creation of a national theatre company.BBC News - The bumpy road to the National Theatre This inspired the foundation of the Royal National Theatre. His proposal was supported by Henry Irving, Charles Dickens and Matthew Arnold among others.

His nickname \\"Tado\\" comes from a Tagalog expletive he frequently blurts out. Tado was primarily known for the offbeat television program Strangebrew and the U92 radio program The BrewRATs!. Early life and career Prior to fame, Tado had worked on various odd jobs such as a staff in a mental hospital, a waiter, a scriptwriter for television and a photojournalist. Tado graduated from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) with a degree in Psychology. He was an active member of Scouts Royale Brotherhood (SRB) International Service Fraternity and Sorority under the waving banner of Beta Tau Chapter. He was engaged in social issues as a student organizer of Sanlakas. While in PUP, Tado was influenced by his artist friends, causing him to be involved in theater, painting and photography. This led to the founding of the now-defunct PUP-based cultural organization called PANDAY PIRA (Pandayan ng Pilipinong Kultura). He eventually studied film making at the Mowelfund Institute. Tado later co- founded Dakila (\\"Noble\\"), an artists group aiming to instill modern-day heroism in everyday people, with poet Lourd de Veyra, bassist for Parokya ni Edgar, Buwi Meneses and acclaimed actor, Ronnie Lazaro. Tado also dabbled in music and had appeared with the band The Youth as their lead vocalist with original vocalist Dodong Cruz's consent. He and the band appeared on the GMA Network program Unang Hirit, singing the band's hit \\"Multong Bakla\\" (\\"gay ghost\\"). Strangebrew Tado became involved in television with the premiere of the off-the-wall magazine show Strangebrew in the then-NU 107 operated UNTV Channel 37, with Angel Rivero as his co-host, in 2001. His maroon Volkswagen Beetle took him and Rivero throughout Metro Manila on an adventure with \\"a unique cartoony look, a caustic wit\\" with \\"a weird sense of humor.\\" Strangebrew and Tado became a cult hit until the show was canceled a year later, with him enshrined as a pop culture icon. In almost all episodes whenever they interview a certain person, Tado throws his famous question \\"Kuya/ate, sa tagal mo nang ginagawa itong trabaho na ito, umibig ka na ba?\\" The BrewRATs! He was reunited with Rivero (along with occasional Strangebrew contributor, Ramon Bautista) in Hit 99.5 FM (now 99.5 Play FM's) late-night talk show The BrewRATs! in which is a pun on the Tagalog slang of the male genitalia. Even with Hit FM's reformatting to 99.5 Campus FM and finally reverting to its old 99.5 RT callsign, the show was consistently placed on the station's roster of shows, and consistently occupying the late- night slot until it was moved to the morning slot from August to September 2009. On October 1, 2009, The BrewRATs! resurfaced on U92, the radio affiliate of MTV Philippines, of which Bautista was a personality of (The Ramon Bautista Show). It went off the air a second time as a result of U92's reformat to Radyo5 92.3 News FM and has since become a show at the internet radio station DigRadio every Thursday from 9 PM to midnight.http://pinoytuner.com/article/191/the-brewrats-are-coming http://pinoytuner.com/popout/192/watch-brewrats LimiTado Aside from radio, Tado also designed LimiTado (\\"Limited\\"), and ran it with his wife. The graphic T-shirts' main selling points are striking messages printed on the shirt and spoofs. Other items include bags, accessories and toy collectibles such as Volkswagen die-casts. He also has a tattoo shop. Political life and activism Tado ran for the position of city councilor of Marikina's 1st District (coextensive with Marikina's 1st congressional district) in 2010 as an independent candidate. He finished eleventh; the first eight in the tally were elected. Tado was involved in protest actions of the Sanlakas political bloc such as the campaign against rising electricity rates,Congress urged to repeal EPIRA law Headlines, News, The Philippine Star philstar.com and demonstrations against Charter Change.INQUIRER Politics He also supported the picket protest of the workers of Philippine Airlines.[Press Release] Tado mag- eemcee sa concert para sa PALEA Human Rights Online Philippines He was also seen visiting Sulu Sultan Jamalul Kiram III, expressing his support in the Sulu Sultanate's claim over Sabah, North Borneo. He also joined the demonstration against the Priority Development Assistance Fund, known as Pork barrel. Tado ran again for the position of city councilor of Marikina's 1st District in 2013 as a candidate under Partido Lakas ng Masa. This would be the second time he lost in the election, finishing at eleventh yet again.

Diagnosis -morphology Osbornoceras grew to be somewhat large and is characterized by a narrow, compressed, strongly curved, exograstric shell. The venter, on the outside curvature, is narrowly rounded while the dorsum, on the opposite inside curvature, is more broadly rounded. The body chamber narrows toward the aperture, which has a deep hypomomic sinus. The siphuncle of Osbornoceras is ventral but not in contact with the ventral wall of the shell. Segments are empty and expanded ventrally but are virtually straight dorsally. Connecting rings are thin, septal necks cyrtochoanitic (outwardly flared). Similar genera Karoceras, from Europe and Russia, which followed in the Middle Silurian, is similar in overall form but is actinosiphonate. Its siphuncle in contrast contains blade- like deposits which project radially inward. Also similar is the closely related Lower Devonian Ankyloceras and earlier Middle and/or Upper Ordovician oncoceratids such as Diagenoceras and Richardsonoceras. Paleoecology Osbornoceras and similar oncocerids were probably benthic predators that lived on the seafloor oriented in life as to face forward with the body chamber parallel to the seafloor and curved phragmocone arched upward. Whether they were pursuit of ambush predators is unknown. Also unknown is the number of arms. Was it the primitive 8 or 10 or the derived 90 plus found in recent Nautilidae.

Firstly, it must be a group of males in team environment, travelling away from home, where they are unconstrained from the usual forms of acceptable behaviour.

In the early 1890, Jenkins began creating the projector. He later met Thomas Armat who provided financial backing and assisted with necessary modifications The two inventors unveiled their modified projector at the Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia, in September 1895. Their machine was the first projector to allow each still frame of the film to be illuminated long enough before advancing to the next frame sequence. This was different from Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope, which simply ran a loop of film with successive images of a moving scene through the camera shutter, which gave a jumbled blur of motion. The Phantoscope, by pausing on each frame long enough for the brain to register a clear single picture, but replacing each frame in sequence fast enough (less than a tenth of a second), produced a smooth and true moving picture. It is from this concept that the entire motion-picture industry has grown.Tube - The Invention of Television, David E. Fisher and Marshal Jon Fisher, 1996 On September 25th, 1985, the two inventors began presenting their completed Phantoscopes at the Cotton States Exposition. Their presentation continued for the next eighteen days, during which the increased strain causes conflicts. Tensions escalated when, on October 13th, Jenkins borrowed one of their three completed Phantoscope. He intended to present the invention in his hometown of Indiana, and promised to return the machine by October 25th. He did not, and instead, remained in Indiana Armat decided to leave the exhibit with their remaining Phantoscope, after a fire destroyed several exhibits and another of their Phantoscopes. What followed was a lengthy court battle in which Jenkins sought a solo patent, but was denied, resulting in Jenkins receiving a solo patent for his initial projector and Armat for the modified version. After the issue was settled, Armat sold his patent to Thomas Alva Edison. Kinetoscope at Machine_History.Com Jenkins continued improving the projector and created motion picture cameras that were eventually used for broadcasting to home receivers by radio waves, or what we know today as, television. Mechanically he broadcast the first television pictures and owned the first commercially licensed television station in the USA. The Franklin Institute later awarded a gold medal to Jenkins for his invention as the world's first practical movie projector.

Biography Oswald Jopseh Gaynier was born in Monroe, Michigan, on 4 March 1915. He enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve as a seaman second class on 3 October 1940 and was appointed Aviation Cadet on 10 December 1940. Commissioned as an ensign on 3 June 1941, he was assigned to Torpedo Squadron 8 on 25 August 1941. In the half of the squadron transitioning to the new Grumman TBF Avenger aircraft in 1942, Ensign Gaynier was not aboard USS Hornet (CV-8) when the ship left Pearl Harbor for the Battle of Midway with the rest of the squadron. Instead, he was in a detachment of six TBFs that flew to Midway Island on 1 June 1942. Led by Lieutenant Langdon K. Fieberling, the detachment participated in the uncoordinated attack by USN, USMC, and USAAF aircraft on the morning of 4 June against the Japanese Carrier Striking Force. Lacking fighter protection and overwhelmed by Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero interceptors, Ensign Gaynier and most of the detachment were shot down and killed. Only Ensign Albert K. Earnest and his radioman, RM3 Harry Ferrier, survived to return to Midway. Awards For his extraordinary heroism and meritorious devotion to duty at Midway, Ensign Gaynier was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously. Namesake The U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS Gaynier (DE-751), launched in 1944 but never completed, was named for Ensign Gaynier.

It provides the underlying scientific, metallurgical and engineering principles and environmental aspects of the production, use and recycling of steel. These internet-delivered resources are aimed at undergraduate students of metallurgy, materials science and engineering subjects as well as graduate employees in the steel industry supply chain. Objectives The basic objective of steeluniversity.org is to inform university students and their teachers about steel technologies and to attract young people to the global steel industry. Another major aim is to reduce the cost of in-service training at steel companies by providing them with freely available training and professional development material. In view of the decline in metallurgy- related courses in universities and the retirement of professors and steel industry experts, it aims to sustain knowledge of ferrous metallurgy by joint efforts of academia and the steel industry. Background A gradual decline in the number of students enrolling in science subjects such as physics and mathematics can be seen in many industrialized countries. This phenomenon has been indicated in several studies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Global Science Forum reports in a study that the relative share of science and technology graduates declined in 10 out of 16 member countries between 1993-2003.OECD Science Technology and Industry Outlook 2006, pp. 98 Metallurgy is one of the most affected disciplines in this trend in terms of available courses, overall enrolments and the number of graduates. An important factor relating to this change in US universities is described as transformation in the late twentieth century of metallurgy departments into ‚Äòmaterial sciences‚Äô departments.Trillo E.; Stafford S. W.; Murr L. E. (1998). Recruiting and retaining students in metallurgy and materials: One university's experience. JOM Journal of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society. Vol. 50, No. 4. pp. 13-14. (Springer Boston). ISSN 1543-1851Flemings M. C. (2001). Why materials science and engineering is good for metallurgy. Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A. Vol. 32, No. 4. pp. 853-860 (Springer Boston). Mechii M. (2006). Thoughts on the Occasion of the Second Transformation in Material Science. Material Science Forum. Vol. 512. pp. 1-4 (Trans Tech Publications Switzerland). A similar pattern in other Western European countries e.g. in the UK Cottrell A. (1976), The Task for the Educator. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series A (Mathematical and Physical Sciences). Vol. 282. No. 1307. pp. 467-471. is reported during the same time span. Steel industry, once an attractive career destination for metallurgy graduates is directly affected by these changes and now faces the challenge of replacing the retiring work force. The idea of preserving knowledge of metallurgy and attracting young people towards career in the steel industry was born out of this challenge. History In response to the declining skilled workforce in the steel industry, the International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI) took the initiative by creating a collection of web-based E-learning resources on metallurgy in a pilot project named Internet Learning of Steel Applications and Processes (ILSAP). Initially two introductory modules; Secondary Steelmaking and Steel for Automotive Applications were launched in partnership with the MATTER project at the University of Liverpool on 1 August 2002 Following the success of the pilot project, the IISI board of governors approved a budget of ‚Ç¨2.5 million for development of an extensive set of E-learning resources and the project was renamed steeluniversity.org in October 2003. E-learning resources The E-learning modules on the website cover major aspects of iron and steelmaking grouped in four different categories: Steel applications * Automotive * Construction * Engineering Steels * Offshore * Packaging Steel processing * Process Route Overview * Basic Oxygen Steelmaking * Electric Arc Furnace * Secondary Steelmaking * Continuous Casting * Hot Rolling * Heat Treatment of Steel Ferrous metallurgy * Thermodynamics and Kinetics * Mechanical Properties * Strengthening Mechanisms Sustainability * Steel and the Environment * Life Cycle Assessment * Environmental Management Steel applications The modules in this section address the selection of steels for different steel markets ‚Äì such as automotive, construction, engineering and offshore applications. Acting as the materials advisor in a multidisciplinary team, the user aims to select suitable steel in order to satisfy design specifications for a particular application. The major engineering design equations are studied during this process in order to select and compare the performance of steel and other metals and materials. 4-D Process Overview of a Steel Plant EAF Steelmaking simulation Secondary Steelmaking simulation Steel processing This section contains a series of interactive simulations of major steelmaking processes from raw materials, Basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) and Electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking, secondary steelmaking, Continuous casting and Hot rolling. Different steel grades can be processed using two levels of operation which are suitable for students and graduates in the industry. The ‚Äòstudent level‚Äô provides a basic functionality enabling the user to understand and control the process principles without too many operational complications, whereas the ‚Äòindustry level‚Äô has advanced functionality and the user needs to deal with practical disturbances that are not anticipated in advance. Real- time feedback is given on the composition and quality of the steel, on process time and temperature and incurred costs, to allow the process to be optimized. A user guide and more conventional supporting e-learning units are also available within each module to enable the learner to better understand the reactions. For example, in the secondary steelmaking module, there are sections on deoxidation, desulphurization, decarburization and dehydrogenation. Ferrous metallurgy The section on ferrous metallurgy contains modules on thermodynamics and kinetics, including strengthening mechanisms, phase transformation, recrystallisation and grain growth, heat treatment and steel properties. An introduction is provided on steel specifications, with exercises to ensure that they can be accurately interpreted. The learner can check mechanical properties of a given grade of steel by conducting virtual tensile, Charpy impact and hardness tests as well. Sustainability This section introduces the environmental aspects of steelmaking, usage and recycling processes. The learner gets a basic idea of Life Cycle Thinking and the method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and its practical application. In addition selected LCA scenarios facing the steel industry and its customers in the automotive and construction sectors can be explored. Available languages The e-learning modules were initially only available in English. Currently, several modules can be found in different languages such as Spanish, Chinese (traditional & simplified), Korean, Russian and German. The process of translation is not yet complete and a number of modules are in various stages of proof reading. steelChallenge The steelChallenge is an annual competition organized by steeluniversity.org for students and steel industry employees. Using one or more of the steelmaking simulations on the steeluniversity.org website, the entrants are to produce a particular steel grade at the lowest cost. The competition runs for a 24-hour period during which multiple attempts are allowed. Awards are given for the best, one for the best industry entry and the other for the best university entry. Other local prizes sponsored by steel companies are also presented at the event.

Nautiloids are a subclass of shelled cephalopods that were once diverse and numerous but are now represented by only a couple of genera, Nautilus and Allonautilus. Hoeloceras, which has a straight shell with a broadly curved to almost flattened venter on the underside and a more highly arched dorsum on the upper, meeting acutely on either side, was named by Walter Sweet in 1958 (Chen & Liu 1977, Teichert 1964) who first recognized it in Ordovician sediments near Oslo, Norway, and included it in the Actinocerida. Teichert (1964) identified Hoeloceras as a synonym of Lambeoceras, as the acutely angled dorso-ventral seam suggests. Flower (1968) referred to Hoeloceras as a \\"flatfish\\", in common with Lambeoceras and Gonioceras, but reassigned it to the Reudemannoceratidae (Discosorida) noting that neither (siphuncular) annuli or parispatium - diagnostic of the Actinocerida - had been observed. Since then specimens identified as Hoeloceras, and retained in the Actinocerida, have been discovered in China (Chen& Liu) and Korea (Yun, Cheol-Soo), where, in Korea, it is associated with the actinocerids, Armenoceras, Ormoceras, and Selkirkoceras.

The theatre closed permanently on June 30, 2012.  The theatre  The theatre boasted a proscenium-style raised stage with an auditorium at ground level. The main theatre had a capacity of 68 seats, and the theatre had its own workshops to build sets and scenery items as well as furniture, props and costume storage facilities. The theatre was mainly used to stage plays, though musicals had been produced as well.  History  The International Theatre was one of the two professional English-language theatres in Vienna (the other being Vienna's English Theatre). It was founded in 1974 by American opera-singers William and Marilyn Wallace and started as a touring company. The first performance (Blithe Spirit, by No√´l Coward) premiered in Graz in November 1974. For the next few years the Wallaces toured shows like Samuel Beckett's Happy Days around the provinces. The IT found its first permanent home in Vienna's 9th district, at the disused Rossauer Cinema on Glasergasse. After several years there, it moved to its present home on January 14, 1980. After the death of her husband William in 2001, Marilyn Wallace assumed the role of executive producer.  Operation  The IT was run as a traditional, around-the year playhouse, with a season lasting from mid- September until beginning of July the next year. Between 4 and 6 productions were presented each season, all produced in-house. The programme relied on long-runs, with occasional repertoire phases, runs lasting between 7 and 18 weeks. Some productions have run for a considerably longer period. All aspects of theatrical productions, including casting, directing, scenery, costume and property production, were covered by in-house staff. Don Fenner held the post of Artistic Director for over twenty years and was also the theatre's technical director. Upon his retirement in 2005, these duties were split between the current Artistic Director, Jack Babb, and a technical director. For over twenty years, the Fundus, a thrust-like studio space in the cellar of the Servitenkirche was used as a second theatre. In recent years, no productions have been mounted there, seemingly due to \\"building restrictions\\". During a short period in the mid-1990s, a repertory system operated at IT, with both the Funds and the Main Stage presenting productions simultaneously. In late 2009, the diocese did not renew the lease contract for the Fundus and told the management that it would have to vacate the space. The Fundus, which had been closed for several months, was abandoned in February 2010.  Controversy  The IT received an annual subvention from the City of Vienna, the amount decreasing steadily with each new year. In 2005, the council launched a theatre reform and appointed an evaluation jury to cut back on the number of theatres it supported. The IT, along with numerous other small companies, did not receive a recommendation and the jury suggested termination of the financial support, which would have resulted in the theatre's closure for good. The crisis was averted by the intervention of ex-mayor Helmut Zilk on the theatre's behalf. The subvention was then cut back severely. In 2005, the Kontrollamt, the council's auditing body, investigated the theatre's financial records, unearthing major inconsistencies and hinting at fraudulent methods and tax evasion. The theatre was fined and had to re-pay a third of the subvention of the following three years to the council. The tabloid press launched a campaign against the theatre on the basis of the Kontrollamt's reports. Wallace never issued an official response to the allegations and the matter soon vanished from the news items.  Closure  In May 2012, the City of Vienna announced that it would suspend all further payments to the theatre. The theatre's closure followed on June 30, 2012 after 38 years of operation and a final performance of Alan Ayckbourn's comedy \\"Relatively Speaking\\". Wallace retired on July 1. The premises of the theatre stood empty for years until in late 2016, a new German-speaking company moved in, carried out cosmetic renovation work and re-named the place \\"Bronski & Gr√ºnberg\\".

From there it narrows somewhat toward the transverse and slightly contracted aperture In section the shell is slightly broader that high. The dorsal side is also somewhat flattened while the ventral or siphuncular side is more narrowly rounded. Septa are shallow and evenly curved; sutures are with broad shallow dorsal and ventral lobes that diverge to the rear and lateral saddles that diverge forward. The siphuncle located close to the ventral margin is slender with short expanded segments that give it a nummuloidal or beaded appearance, and contains irregular blade-like actinosiphonate deposits.

The serial was originally released to be booked by theaters in any one of three ways: as a conventional serial of twelve weekly chapters of equal running times; as a 60-minute feature film comprising the first four episodes, to be followed by the remaining 8 episodes in weekly serial format; or as a stand-alone feature comprising the first four chapters (the fourth episode ending not with a cliffhanger, but with an apparent resolution to the story). In 1935, the remaining 8 episodes of the serial were also edited into a second feature film, of 65 minute length, released as Chandu on the Magic Island. This serial marked one of the few times that Lugosi played a protagonist rather than an antagonist: in fact, Lugosi had played Roxor, the main villain, in the 1932 film Chandu the Magician.  Plot summary  Frank Chandler (B√©la Lugosi in a rare heroic role): a powerful but kind man who has spent most of his life in the Orient, where he is renowned under the name of \\"Chandu the Magician\\" for his tremendous skill with White Magic. He is in love with the Princess Nadji of Egypt, who has lately escaped to America and is now staying with the Chandler family at their home in Beverly Hills, California. Princess Nadji believes she has left her troubles behind in Egypt, but when the Chandlers hold a party in her honor, she learns that her life is still in jeopardy, as are the lives of her friends. Chandu, presently arriving home from Egypt himself, is pursued by enemies at the airport, and escapes only by using his magic ring. At the party, some shady guests conspire to poison Princess Nadji, and Chandu arrives just in time to snatch the glass of deadly wine out of her hand. Chandu explains to Nadji what has happened, and why she is in danger. A cult of Black Magic sorcerers, the Sect of Ubasti, have recently recovered the perfectly preserved body of their last high priestess, Ossana. Legend tells that Ossana will one day be resurrected and will rule the \\"lost continent\\" of Lemuria again; however, in order to resurrect her, the Ubasti must make a human sacrifice, and the sacrifice must be an Egyptian princess of royal blood. \\"Princess Nadji is the only living Egyptian princess,\\" says Chandu, \\"and the Ubasti will stop at nothing.\\" The cult are determined to capture Nadji and sacrifice her to their god. The twelve chapters of The Return of Chandu follow Chandu and his family (his sister, his nephew, and his niece) on various adventures while they struggle, by both magical and not-so-magical means, to rescue and protect Princess Nadji from the Sect of Ubasti. Their journey brings them finally to the land of Lemuria itself, where Chandu must decide whether he can renounce his love for Nadji in order to save her life.

The disorder was first recognized in the 1950s, with the first description provided by Hunt et al. in 1954. More recently, pathogenic variants within the ALDH7A1 gene have been identified to cause PDE. Genetics PDE is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is estimated to affect around 1 in 400,000 to 700,000 births, though one study conducted in Germany estimated a prevalence of 1 in 20,000 births. The ALDH7A1 gene encodes for the enzyme antiquitin or Œ± -aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, which is involved with the catabolism of lysine. Treatment Patients with PDE do not respond to anticonvulsant medications, but seizures rapidly cease with therapeutic intravenous doses of Vitamin B6 and remission from seizures are often maintained on daily therapeutic doses of Vitamin B6. An optimal dose has not yet been established, but doses of 50‚Äì100 mg/day or 15‚Äì30 mg/kg/day have been proposed. Importantly, excessive doses of vitamin B6 can result in irreversible neurological damage, and therefore several guidelines recommend between 200 mg (neonates) and 500 mg per day as the maximal daily dose. Despite remission of seizure activity with vitamin B6 supplementation, intellectual disability is frequently seen in patients with PDE. Because the affected enzyme antiquitin is involved in the cerebral lysine degradation pathway, lysine restriction as an additional treatment modality has recently been explored. Studies have been published which demonstrate potential for improved biomarkers, development, and behavior in patients treated with lysine restriction in addition to pyridoxine supplementation. In trial, lysine restriction of 70‚Äì100 mg/kg/day in children less than 1 year of age, 45‚Äì80 mg/kg/day in children between 1‚Äì7 years of age, and 20‚Äì45 mg/kg/day in children older than 7 years of age were prescribed. Despite the potential of additional benefit from lysine restriction, vitamin B6 supplementation remains the main-stay of treatment given lack of studies thus far demonstrating the safety and efficacy of lysine restriction for this purpose. Monitoring Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of pipecolic acid are frequently elevated in patients with PDE, though it is a non-specific biomarker. Œ±-aminodipic semialdehyde is elevated in urine and plasma and is a more specific biomarker for PDE. Improvements in these biomarkers have been reported with the implementation of a lysine-restricted diet. Initial studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of lysine restriction evaluated developmental and cognitive outcomes by age-appropriate tests and parental observations.

Origins The ruling dynasty took its name from King Diarmait Finn of Connacht (died 833), and the territory in turn was named after them. It seems to have been created by the U√≠ Bri√∫in in the ninth century during a wave of expansion under his grandson, Uatu ua Diarmada. Its kings appeared regularly in the annals from 971 onwards Concannon By the 11th century its kings had taken the surname √ì Con Cheanain (Concannon).

O'Concannon went in pursuit of the prey, but he was at once killed. Conor Oge Mac Dermot, with his kinsmen, afterwards set out on an excursion against the Clann-Maurice; but a forewarning of their intentions having reached the Clann-Maurice, they had all their forces in readiness to meet them; but the others advanced as far as the town of Brees in despite of them, and burned it, both buildings and corn, and slew many persons around it; and Conor and his people afterwards returned, by dint of prowess, without any of them receiving injury.
