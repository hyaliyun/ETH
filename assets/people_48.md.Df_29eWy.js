His work is widely published and exhibited internationally. In 2013, Chow's portrait of iconic Chinese artist and activist Ai Wei Wei was awarded at the World Press Photo. Chow frequently collaborates with economist Hui-Yi Lin using extensive data and research to produce long term visual projects. One of their prominent projects is ‚ÄúThe Poverty Line\\", a visual project that contextualizes global poverty. The Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago and the Central Academy of Fine Arts Museum in Beijing has acquired works to their permanent collection. Early years Stefen Chow graduated from Temasek Junior College before pursuing tertiary education in the National University of Singapore (NUS). Subsequently, Stefen Chow was tasked with the role of being the team's photographer for the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centennial Everest Team in 2002-05. After the team successfully summited Mount Everest in 2005, Chow decided to shoot professionally after meeting New York based UN photographer John Isaac and getting a positive review of his portfolio. In 2007, Chow left for New York City to assist professional photographers and take classes at the International Center of Photography. He studied under photographer Amy Arbus, daughter of Dianne Arbus. Chow also attended the Eddie Adams Workshop. He shifted to Beijing in 2008 and has been based there since.  Works  Using data and extensive research, Chow's works take social and economic themes and translate them into visual art. = The Poverty Line = The Poverty Line is an ongoing project which began in China in 2010 and has since expanded to 28 countries across 6 continents. The Poverty Line uses food as a base to examine the choices a person living at the poverty line would face. Chow is the co-creator of the project together with Hui-Yi Lin, an economist. Quoted from the website: > \\"The project takes a typological photographic approach over time. Each > country's figure is based on their poverty line definition and official > national statistics to derive a per capita per day rate, with household food > expenditure incorporated for developed countries. Food is then procured from > local markets using that monetary amount. Every individual piece of work is > photographed with the food items placed on local newspapers purchased on the > day of the shoot, with the dimensions and lighting carefully measured to > have a uniform aesthetic across time and geographical spread. The result is > a large typological photographic statement that addresses the complex issues > of global poverty using economics, photography and food choices.\\" The project has been featured by multiple international print and online publications and exhibited as large scale installations in many prominent galleries and institutions. = Equivalence = Equivalence is a project which talks about the tensions between a need and a want, from the haves and the have-nots. By comparing the value between a luxury item over a daily necessity, the project aims to invoke the question of equality in the viewer's mind. = The Play Project = The Play Project is an aerial survey of 100 playgrounds spread across Singapore, which are then arranged and according to the subway map of the city on its website. The project was supported by the SG50 celebration fund. Photographed using a drone, the aerial view of playgrounds in Singapore is visually stunning, allowing viewers to see the playgrounds in Singapore in a new light. According to the research done by Stefen Chow and his collaborator Lin Hui Yi, there are about 1500 playgrounds in Singapore and this project has chosen 100 public playgrounds across Singapore to feature.

Four Finnish cave divers face their worst nightmare when two of their friends drown deep inside an underwater cave in Norway. When the official recovery operation is called off by the Norwegian and British authorities after being deemed too risky, the friends set out on a secret mission to retrieve the bodies themselves. The film premiered at the 2016 Docpoint Helsinki on January 27, 2016, and had its international premiere in Visions du R√©el film festival, Switzerland in April 2016. Synopsis The film opens with footage of a group of Finnish divers attempting to swim through a cave system in Plurdalen, Norway. The dive requires them to cut through ice and swim down into the Pluragrotta cave to depths of over 130m before emerging the other side in a dry cave. During the course of the dive, two of the team, Jari Huotarinen and Jari Uusimaki died. An international team of rescue divers attempted to retrieve the bodies but ultimately abandoned the attempt due to the dangers involved, and the caves were closed by the police. Despite this, the survivors of the original diving team planned a covert but well-supported return expedition to retrieve the bodies of their friends. They were accompanied by the documentary crew that had originally begun filming their attempt to swim through the cave, and the dives were recorded on helmet- worn cameras. The retrieval attempt was ultimately successful and both bodies were brought to the surface. The Norwegian police decided not to press charges against the divers.

It is a dwarf annual halophyte with fleshy, apparently jointed stems and reduced leaves and flowers. The two subspecies show a disjunct distribution in Spain and Western Asia.  Description  Microcnemum coralloides grows as a low annual herb of 5‚Äì10 cm height. The color is variable, the subspecies Microcnemum coralloides subsp. coralloides is often purplish. The erect stems are branched. The opposite leaves are fleshy small scales, connate in the lower part and cup-like stem-clasping. All branches are terminating in cone-like inflorescences, 1.5‚Äì3 cm long. Cymes consist of (two or) three minute flowers that are sunk in the axil of each opposite bract. The bisexual flowers are free. The connate tepals are reduced to a minute membranous lobe or sometimes absent, especially in fruit. There is only one stamen and an ovary with two stigmas. The vertical seed is ovoid, somewhat flattened, reddish-magenta, with tubercular or papillose surface. The seed contains the terete curved embryo and copious perisperm (feeding tissue).  Distribution and habitat  Microcnemum coralloides is distributed in the Mediterranean region and Western Asia. The two subspecies show remarkable disjunct areals: Microcnemum coralloides subsp. coralloides occurs in central and eastern Spain, Microcnemum coralloides subsp. anatolicum occurs in Turkey, Syria, Armenia, and Iran. The plants are halophytes and grow at the shores of very saline flat lagoons and inland saltpans, often on thick salt crusts, together with few other halophytes, tolerating extreme salinity during the dry season. Microcnemum coralloides is a rare species.  Systematics and phylogeny  The first valid species description was made in 1863 by Francisco Loscos Bernal and Jos√© Pardo Sastr√≥n as Arthrocnemum coralloides Loscos & J.Pardo (in: Willkomm, H.M.: Series Inconfecta Plantarum Aragoniae, Dresde: p. 90). Before that, the authors had used the name Salicornia fastigiata in an unpublished manuscript, \\"Flora de Arag√≥n\\". In 1876, Franz Ungern-Sternberg transferred the species to a new monotypic genus, Microcnemum. But his Microcnemum fastigiatum (Loscos & J.Pardo) Ung.-Sternb. was an illegitimate name, because it is based on an unpublished name. Od√≥n de Buen corrected the combination to Microcnemum coralloides (Loscos & J.Pardo) Buen in 1883. A further synonym is Loscosia aragonensis Willk. ex Pau (nomen illegit). The genus comprises just one species, Microcnemum coralloides. There are two subspecies differing mainly by their seed characters. Slight differences concerning height, succulence, branching, and coloration (the eastern subspecies is never purplish) are variable and seem to be influenced by seasonal fluctuations of rainfall and soil salinity. *Microcnemum coralloides (Loscos & J.Pardo) Buen subsp. coralloides - with granulose or slightly papillose surface of the seed coat. *Microcnemum coralloides subsp. anatolicum Wagenitz \\\\- with densely and distinctly papillose surface of the seed coat. Microcnemum is closely related to the genus Arthrocnemum. Together with the phylogenetic lineages of Sarcocornia/Salicornia and the Australian members (Tecticornia) of the subfamily Salicornioideae, they probably evolved during the Mid Miocene at the shores of the Thetys Sea. Phylogenetic research indicates that Microcnemum coralloides originated in the East Mediterranean region, the split of the subspecies ranging from 2.8‚Äì0.5 million years ago. Microcnemum coralloides subsp. coralloides seems to have evolved during cold periods of the Early Pleistocene, when lower sea level allowed westward migration along coastal saline lagoons. Probably soon after the arrival in Iberia, the distribution range was interrupted during a following warm period.  References  Carlez Bened√≠ Gonz√°lez, Josep M.

History = Construction and opening = The Sofitel Philippine Plaza, was originally built as the Philippine Plaza, one of several hotels rushed into construction at the behest of Imelda Marcos for the 1976 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Manila during the administration of her husband, President Ferdinand Marcos. The hotel was designed by Leandro Locsin of Leandro V. Locsin & Partners, who would be named a National Artist of the Philippines for architecture. = Management and renovation history = The hotel was managed under the Westin brand until the management contract with Starwood hotels ended in 2005. The Westin Hotel Company made renovations on the hotel in 1994 and July 1995. In 2006, the hotel signed a new management contract with AccorHotels. The following year, after extensive renovation works worth millions of pesos, the hotel was rebranded as Sofitel Philippine Plaza. Features In 1994, before the AccorHotels group took over ownership from Westin, the hotel hosted 670 guest rooms. In 2016, it hosted 609 rooms and 46 suites. The hotel hosts the Grand Plaza Ballroom which can accommodate between 1,000-1,400 people. For smaller functions, the ballroom can be divided into three smaller ballrooms that are given names of the country's three major island groupings: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

It was built in an area, Santa Maria, whose development over time has been greatly conditioned by this project. Nowadays this area is mainly made up of three or four-storey buildings with wide streets in between. History The decision to build a new provincial institution for mental health in Potenza dates back to the early twentieth century. The Provincial Deputation of Basilicata wanted to reduce the expenses paid by municipalities to send the mentally ill to Aversa Psychiatric Hospital, which was in another region. The Province of Potenza spent between 80,000 and 100,000 lire a year for the treatment of the mentally ill in the Royal psychiatric hospitals. By spending just a little more than that, the Province would have built a mental institution and would have taken care of local patients. Moreover, there was a \\"humane\\" reason behind this idea: patients‚Äô rehabilitation had proved to be very problematic in large mental health institutions, where the care was usually poor due to the high number of patients. In a local smaller mental hospital, the odds that the ill would get better were higher. Pavilions of the mental hospital on the right (photo by Concetto Valente). In 1905 a competition was announced. The prize of 600 lire was given to Giuseppe Quaroni and Marcello Piacentini for the Ophelia project. Quaroni, an engineer, and Piacentini, an architect, were both from Rome and they named their project after the Hamlet character, Ophelia, who goes mad and drowns herself in Shakespeare‚Äôs tragedy (‚ÄúO heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye. By heaven, thy madness shall be paid with weight‚Ä¶‚Äù (act IV, scene V). The estimated outlay for the project was of 1,100,000 lire that had to be spent to build the main wards within five years. In 1907 the foundation stone was laid, but the works only began in 1910. Unfortunately, due to the high costs, the outbreak of World War I and also the alteration of the initial plan to stand up to the expenses, the Provincial Council decided not to earmark the buildings for the mental institution anymore. Until 1920, they thought of converting the complex into a Military Hospital. Meanwhile, the buildings were used as warehouses for crops or for any other necessity. The final decision was to convert some wards into private residences; others became the premises of a primary school, of a post office and a museum. The originality of the Ophelia Project The Ophelia Project by Quaroni and Piacentini was impressively original. Never before had anyone designed a mental hospital like this in Southern Italy. In the introduction to their project, the two designers explained that a mental hospital had to satisfy two requirements: it should be like an ordinary hospital, since it is a treatment centre where sick people are hospitalized; but, at the same time, it should also be like a prison, since all the patients have to be well guarded in order to prevent escapes and suicides. Quaroni and Piacentini made another point: what if patients became aware of their ‚Äúcaptive state‚Äù? In order to avoid that, they looked for a solution that could make their stay a little more pleasant, especially in the moments of higher consciousness; so they opted for the separation of the different types of patients in different pavilions, each of them surrounded by blooming gardens and boulevards that would provide the healing power of nature. Quiet female patients' pavilion (photo by Hajar Chkara, 2016). Following an in-depth study on mental illness, Quaroni and Piacentini designed blocks for the following profiles of mentally ill patients: tranquilli (quiet) ‚Äì semiagitati (semi-violent) ‚Äì agitati e furiosi (violent and furious) ‚Äì sudici ed epilettici (filthy and epilectic)‚Äì paralitici ed infermi (paralytic and infirm)‚Äì fanciulli e idioti (children and idiots) ‚Äì contagiosi (infectious) ‚Äì dementi criminali (insane criminals). Semi-violent female patients' pavilion (photo by Hajar Chkara, 2016). Even the place where these patients had to stay was not the result of a random choice. For example, quiet and semi-violent patients were placed in the buildings closer to the station or to the Colonia agricola (farming colony) where they could work the land or do manual labour, thus promoting their rehabilitation process. Another important issue was the positioning of the lavatories. In the past the outhouse was one of the ‚Äúfavourite‚Äù suicide spots, since it used to be far from all the places regularly frequented by nurses. Quaroni and Piacentini wanted to place them against some buildings so that patients could be well monitored by nurses and other assistants; but, of course, big windows and openings were needed to ensure adequate ventilation. In addition, to improve the ventilation of the whole complex, the two designers decided to raise the ground level to 760 metres in height. The psychiatric hospital was organized in accordance with two principal axes: the cross one, from east to west, named asse dei vari reparti (the ward axis), and the long one, from north to south, named asse dei servizi (the service axis). The entire complex was symmetrical to the service axis, where there were the common service buildings, while on the transverse axis there were to be the wards. There were two entrances: the main entrance was set at the intersection between the service axis and the Provincial road and the secondary one, also called service entrance, was positioned at the crossing between the facility axis and the street leading to the station. Each part was connected with the others by a tunnel which was used to provide every building by means of a Decauville railway (which started from the kitchen building). The Administration building and the access to the tunnel (photo by Hajar Chkara, 2016). The principal entrance was characterized by a vehicle ramp and two separate flights of steps at the sides of the tunnel, which allowed to get to the upper square. Here there was the Amministrazione (the Administration building), which included the administrative and medical management of the wards, and men's and women's visitors‚Äô rooms. Moreover, the square was delimited by the Accettazione Donne (female admission, east) and Accettazione Uomini (male admission, west) pavilions. The kitchen building (photo by Martina Ciaglia, 2016). Behind the Administration building there was the Cucina (the kitchen building) which contained large warehouses directly supplied through the tunnel, and the rooms where the personnel were to have meals. Separated by a large courtyard, there was the Cappella Sacra (the chapel) and on its sides the drugstore and the chaplain's home. They were in front of the Lavanderia (the steam laundry pavilion) and the Guardaroba (the linen storage building). Every building which was supposed to host patients had two floors: on the ground floor there was the pantry, the kitchen, the dining hall, the doctor's office, a room for male nurses, bathrooms and toilets, while upstairs there were the dormitories, female nurses' rooms and a little room with linen cupboards. Pavilions could have extra space according to the type of mental illness. More distant from the whole complex, there was the Colonia Agricola (farming colony), the Sezione contagiosi (contagious building) with a mortuary, and the Fabbricato della disinfestazione (disinfection building) in two different areas. The farming colony was composed of a cowshed, a barn and a depot and was near the access to the Provincial railway. The farmer's and the undertaker's homes were next to the service entrance. Conclusion The Ophelia Project consisted of 18 pavilions and other minor buildings. Today there are only 8 buildings that are still used as private housing: the administration pavilion, the reception for women, the reception for men, the quiet female patients‚Äô pavilion, the women's infirmary, the kitchen, the linen storage building and the farming colony. They are all private residences, totalling 37 flats. Bibliography * Marcello Piacentini, Manicomio di Potenza, in \\"Architettura Italiana\\", a.

It is very commonly used in biology for protein expression and production of recombinant retroviruses.  Origin  293T was created in Michele Calos's lab at Stanford by stable transfection of the HEK 293 cell line with a plasmid encoding a temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 large T antigen; it was originally referred to as 293/tsA1609neo. The first reference to the cell line as \\"293T\\" may be its use to create the BOSC23 packaging cell line for producing retroviral particles.  Characteristics  The transfection used to create 293T (involving plasmid pRSV-1609) conferred neomycin/G418 resistance and expression of the tsA1609 allele of SV40 large T antigen; this allele is fully active at 33 ¬∞C (its permissive temperature), has substantial function at 37 ¬∞C, and is inactive at 40 ¬∞C. 293T is very efficiently transfectable with DNA (like its parent HEK 293). Due to the expression of SV40 large T antigen, transfected plasmid DNAs that carry the SV40 origin of replication can replicate in 293T and will transiently maintain a high copy number; this can greatly increase the amount of recombinant protein or retrovirus that can be produced from the cells.  Genome  The full genome sequences of three different isolates of 293T have been determined. They are quite similar to each other but show detectable divergence from the parental HEK 293 cell line.

Morbioli was married but separated from his wife after experiencing a sudden religious conversion in Venice during a grave illness - he forever wandered the streets preaching on penance and the need for personal mortifications. His use of a white habit has given rise to misconceptions that he was part of the Carmelite Order when he was not. Morbioli's beatification received full approval on 24 October 1843 after Pope Gregory XVI confirmed the late penitent's longstanding and enduring local 'cultus' - or popular veneration. Life Ludovico Morbioli was born in 1433 in Bologna to Francesco Antonio and Agnes Morbioli as one of six children (five males and one female). He led a dissolute life of vice that included drinking and other forms of pleasure- seeking. Morbioli married Lucia Tura - the daughter of Giovanni who knew Morbioli's father. In 1462 he relocated to Venice where he was stricken with a serious illness which prompted him to be taken to the Canons Regular of Saint Salvatore for aid and in order to recuperate. It was during his time of recuperation that he underwent a profound spiritual crisis that challenged him to the core and resulted in his determination to make a radical change to his own life - one of penance for his earlier misdeeds. He returned to Bologna sometime in 1470 in order to start a life of penitence with austerities he would undertake as a particular penance. He separated from his wife and put on a plain shirt - hence being confused for a Carmelite - and then put on a white one with a cross on his chest that he wore all the time. He preached penance and self-mortification to the people that he encountered and he would often go with those condemned to the scaffold for merciful comfort and solace. He visited Modena and Ferrara on a mule and travelled with a cross in his hands. He slept on the pavement and in other places like the homeless did and he let his hair become wild and his beard grow. He spent his last months in a basement that he transformed into a cell like those in convents. Morbioli fell ill and refused each kind of relief to help him recover but his refusal led to his peaceful death on the basement floor on 9 November 1485. His remains were interred in the Cathedral of Saint Peter but could not later be relocated in its restoration that took place under Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti from 1566 until 1597. His remains have not been uncovered. Beatification The beatification process commenced under Pope Innocent X in 1654 after being titled as a Servant of God while Cardinal Girolamo Boncompagni inaugurated the process; this process never completed and the cause was suspended despite such a popular 'cultus' - or popular veneration - to the late Morbioli. The formal confirmation of this 'cultus' on 24 October 1843 allowed for Pope Gregory XVI to approve his beatification.

In chemistry, ureas are a class of organic compounds with the formula (R2N)2CO where R = H, alkyl, aryl, etc. Thus, in addition to describing a specific chemical compound (H2N)2CO), urea is the name of a functional group that is found in many compounds and materials of both practical and theoretical interest. Generally ureas are colorless crystalline solids, which, owing to the presence of fewer hydrogen bonds, exhibit melting points lower than that of urea itself. Structure of N,N'-diphenylurea showing intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Synthesis Ureas can be prepared many methods, but rarely by direct carbonation, which is the route to urea itself. Instead, methods can be classified according those that assemble the urea functionality and those that start with preformed urea. =Assembly of N-substituted urea functionality= Phosgenation entails the reaction of amines with phosgene, proceeding via the isocyanate (or carbamoyl chloride) as an intermediate: :COCl2 \\\\+ R2NH ‚Üí R2NC(O)Cl + HCl :COCl2 \\\\+ RNH2 ‚Üí RNCO + 2 HCl Overall reaction: :COCl2 \\\\+ 2 R2NH ‚Üí (R2N)2CO + 2 HCl Tetramethylurea is prepared in this way and in general secondary amines give reliable results. Reactions using primary amines must be carefully controlled as the isocyanate intermediate can react with the urea to form a biuret: :R2NC(O)N(H)R' + R\\"NCO ‚Üí R2NC(O)NR'C(O)NHR\\" Unsymmetrical ureas are generated by condensation of isocyanates with amines: :RNCO + R'2NH ‚Üí (R'2N)(R(H)N)CO Analogously, unsymmetrical primary ureas are generated by condensation of ammonium salts and alkali metal cyanates: :Na+NCO‚àí \\\\+ [R2NH2]Cl ‚Üí (R‚Äô2N)(H2N)CO + KCl The artificial sweetener dulcin is produced by the condensation of ethoxyaniline with potassium cyanate. Si(NCO)4 is also used as a precursor to such unsymmetrical ureas. bis(hydroxymethyl)urea and related compounds are additives for permanent press clothing. Isobutylidenediurea. The very high toxicities of compounds such as phosgene and isocyanates makes them unappealing to work with and there has been a drive towards safer reagents. These have traditionally been more expensive and hence mostly been limited to laboratory-scale work. =From urea= Urea undergoes transamidation with alkyl and aryl amines: :(H2N)2CO + R2NH ‚Üí (R2N)(H2N)CO + NH3 :(R2N)(H2N)CO + R2NH ‚Üí (R2N)2CO + NH3 These reactions are used to prepare cyclic ureas. Monomethylurea, precursor to theobromine, is produced from methylamine and urea. Phenylurea is produced similarly but from anilinium chloride: :(H2N)2CO + [R2NH2]Cl ‚Üí (R2N)(H2N)CO + NH4Cl Ureas containing N-H bonds, including urea itself, are readily alkylated by aldehydes. The products are Œ±-hydroxyalkylureas. Formaldehyde gives the bis(hydroxymethyl)urea, an intermediate in the formation of urea-formaldehyde resins. Cyclic ureas result from glyoxal ((CHO)2): :(H2N)2CO + (CHO)2 ‚Üí (CH(OH)NH)2CO Two equivalents of urea condense with isobutyraldehyde giving the alkylidene derivative: :2(H2N)2CO + OC(H)CHMe2 ‚Üí (H2N)C(O)NH]2CHCHMe2 \\\\+ H2O This derivative, isobutylidenediurea, is used as a slow-release fertilizer because in the soil it slowly hydrolyzes, reverting to urea, an excellent source of fixed nitrogen.

At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships Towers raced in the 200m, 400m and 800m events. He failed to qualify for the 200m final, and finished outside the medal places in both the 400m (6th) and 800m (6th). The following year, in the buildup to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Towers competed at the European Championships in Grosseto. He finished fourth in the 100m, but took the full sweep of medals in his other three events. He took bronze in the 200m sprint, behind Russia's Sebastien Mobre and eventual winner Henry Manni. In the 400m he won silver, again behind his main rival Manni. The 800m race saw Towers win his first major international gold medal recording a championship record of 1:44.67. More importantly it saw him beat Manni, who finished second despite posting a personal best. Following his performance in Grosseto, Towers was selected for the Great Britain athletics team for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in the 800m T34.

He was featured by Footwear News as one of the rising talents in the high-end men's footwear and noted by GQ Brazil as one the emerging designers to join the elite of British fashion. Vanassibara's footwear was already early on stocked worldwide at the Japanese stores Isetan and Dover Street Market Ginza, the French boutique L‚ÄôEclaireur, the Hong Kong-based shops Joyce and On Pedder, among others.

Scott was a notable early example of a successful manager in the textile industry, achieving significant wealth within the largest company of the time whilst being neither self-made nor from a textile family. Born the son of a farmer at Abbey Holm in Cumbria, he was a salesman by the time of his 1845 marriage to Maria in Cheetham Hill, north Manchester. He became a business partner of Henry Tootal Broadhurst, Henry Lee and Joseph Lee who together subsequently formed the company Tootal Broadhurst Lee, a vertically integrated firm that was unusual for its time in combining weaving and spinning and was to become by the 1880s the largest cotton manufacturer in Lancashire. Henry Tootal Broadhurst's son, Edward Tootal Broadhurst would go on to become company chairman. Scott became 'cashier', or finance director, of Tootal Broadhurst Lee in 1854 and was deputy chairman of the Equitable Fire and Accident Office insurance company; by the 1881 census he was described a spinning manufacturer. Denzell Hall, Scott's mansion in Bowdon In 1874 Scott bought ten acres of land in Bowdon, south Manchester, from the Earl of Stamford at a cost of ¬£7075 and built a large villa, Denzell, to the designs of the architects Clegg and Knowles. The house cost ¬£18,000 to build and a reported ¬£30,000 in all. Scott was recorded in the 1881 census as living at Denzell with his wife and a staff of nine. The building is now known as Denzell Hall and is Grade II* listed as a notable example of a specifically commissioned late nineteenth century house for a wealthy patron with a high degree of craftsmanship and quality of materials. The listing cites the design as inventive and eclectic and by a noted Manchester architects' practice; the architectural critic Pevsner described it as a luscious but 'very bad' mixture of debased Jacobean, Gothic and Italianate. Scott's son Henry predeceased him and at his death in 1904 the house was sold to the Lamb family.

It has facilities for the offloading and reloading of LNG from ships at two jetties on the River Medway; for storing and blending LNG; for truck loading; and regasifying and blending natural gas to meet UK specifications. The terminal can handle up to 15 million tonnes per annum of LNG, has storage capacity for one million cubic metres of LNG, and is able to regasify up to 645 GWh per day (58 million cubic metres per day) for delivery into the high pressure gas National Transmission System (NTS). The facility is owned and operated by National Grid Grain LNG Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of National Grid.  History  The Grain LNG terminal is located on the site of the BP Kent refinery which closed in 1982 and was subsequently demolished. The Grain LNG site covers a total area of 600 acres (240 ha). In 1980 British Gas constructed a LNG peak-shaving facility on the south west of the refinery site. The facility was used to support the NTS at times of high demand, and to ensure security of gas supplies in SE England. During periods of high demand liquefied gas was pumped from storage tanks and heated in vapourisers to a gaseous state for delivery into the NTS. There are four tanks each of 50,000 m3 (total storage capacity of 200,000 m3), constructed of 9% nickel-steel alloy insulated with perlite, each with a containment bund to half the tank height. At times of low demand gas could be withdrawn from the NTS and liquefied by cryogenic cooling to minus 162 ¬∞C to replenish the storage tanks. An adjacent gas holder received gaseous boil-off from the tanks.  Site development  The gas industry and the regulator Ofgem opened up the UK gas market to competition in 1997. This facilitated a variety of shippers to bring LNG from around the world into the UK market. To exploit this position National Grid Grain LNG Ltd was formed in 2002 to develop the Isle of Grain site from a peak-shaving plant into a LNG import, storage, and enhanced regasification facility. Development and expansion has taken place over four phases. = Phase 1 (2002‚Äì05) = Work began in 2002 to convert the facility into a LNG ship import terminal. The original storage tanks were refurbished and new boil-off compression facility for ship offloading was installed. In July 2005 a new 1 km long jetty (Jetty No.10) was commissioned on the north bank of the River Medway at the south-east of the site. The jetty is capable of handling LNG tankers of 70,000 to 217,000 m3 cargo capacity (QFlex). LNG is pumped through a 4.5 km cryogenic pipeline system rated at 12,000 m3/h (5,000 tonnes per hour) to the storage tanks located 3.3 km from the jetty. New compressors and vapourisers were also installed. By 2005 the terminal had the capacity to receive and process up to 3.3 million tonnes of LNG a year, or 13 million cubic metres of gas (140 GWh) per day. The new facilities enabled the Grain terminal to become a base supply to the NTS, with the ability to deliver gas continuously when required. The cost of the Phase 1 project was ¬£130m. A 20-year contract with BP / Sonatrach enabled Grain LNG to import LNG on a long term basis from July 2005.  Strategic energy supplies (2003‚Äì04)  The UK Government‚Äôs Energy White Paper of February 2003 identified the need for additional infrastructure to assure gas supplies and to reduce the strategic risk to the UK of dependency on a limited number of sources. Having been a net exporter of gas the UK became a net importer in 2004 as demand exceeded gas production from the UK continental shelf. The deficit was initially met by importing gas by pipeline from continental Europe and importing LNG. The LNG was obtained on the competitive world market from a diversity of sources in North and West Africa, Russia, the Middle East and the Caribbean. In this context Grain LNG Ltd further developed the terminal. = Phase 2 (2005‚Äì08) = In 2005-8 Grain LNG Ltd constructed new facilities for the storage and gasification of LNG. The facilities included three LNG storage tanks each with a capacity of 190,000 m3 (48.7 m high, 87.4 m diameter), each holding as much as the four original tanks. These are full containment vessels with an inner nickel-steel alloy and an outer pre-stressed concrete wall with a reinforced concrete roof. The tanks were constructed in the north-west part of the site to the north of the existing tanks. Each tank has a concrete mass of 72,000 tonnes and is supported on 1,560 piles, 600 mm in diameter and a depth of 24 metres. The new facilities included eight submerged combustion water bath vapourisers. These heat and vapourise LNG flowing in stainless steel coils from minus 162 ¬∞C to 6 ¬∞C. Two Combined Heat and Power (CHP) gas turbines provide power to the site, and the waste heat is piped to the adjacent vapourisers, to reduce the gas required for firing. The cost of the Phase 2 facilities was ¬£350m. The capacity was sold to three customers: Sonatrach (Algeria), Centrica and Gaz de France. Under phase 2, a further 6.5 million tonnes per year of capacity was contracted on a long term basis from December 2008. The new plant brought the capability of the site to a throughput of 10.5 million tonnes of LNG (about 12% of UK gas demand). = Phase 3 (2007‚Äì10) = Phase 3 was announced in May 2007 to increase storage, ship unloading and vapourisation capabilities. A fourth 190,000 m3 LNG storage tank was constructed to the east of the three existing tanks. A second jetty (Jetty No. 8) was constructed on the River Medway (after demolition of the former jetty 8) together with an associated cryogenic pipeline to the existing transfer pipeline. The jetty has three 16-inch loading arms and a 16-inch vapour return arm. The jetty is capable of handling LNG tankers of 125,000 to 266,000 m3 cargo capacity (QMax). The 36-inch diameter 4.5 km nickel-steel pipeline has a flexible polyurethane (PUR) foam insulation in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) casing, the line transfers LNG between the jetty and the storage sites. There is also a 14-inch recirculation line. Additional facilities included further submerged combustion vapourisers; boil-off gas compressors; nitrogen facilities; and a vent stack. The development provided an additional five million tonnes of capacity per annum. All this capacity was contracted out from December 2010. Customers included BP, Iberdrola, Sonatrach, Centrica, E.ON and GDF Suez. The Isle of Grain Combined Heat and Power (CHP) project was completed in late 2010. The CHP plant transferred 340 MW of heat energy from the steam condensation process within the Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) to the LNG vapourisers at the Grain LNG site. This further reduced the quantity of gas burned in the vapourisers. = Phase 4 (2014‚Äì19) = Phase 4 of the Grain development was announced in February 2014. This included a proposed fifth 190,000 m3 storage tank immediately to the east of the Phase 3 tank. Other proposed facilities include a new process plant (compressors and vapourisers) and a second cryogenic line from the jetty area to the Phase 4 process plant. Grain LNG Ltd has offered an additional six million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity. Phase 4 was completed in the winter of 2018-9.  Current facilities  The Grain LNG terminal currently has a LNG storage capacity of one million cubic metres and a throughput capability of 15 million tonnes per annum, equivalent to 20% of UK gas demand. In terms of storage capacity it is the largest LNG facility in Europe and the eighth largest in the world. The regasification plant has a capacity of 645 GWh/day (58 million cubic metres per day). Gas flows in two pipelines to Shorne, Kent, where there are two connections to the NTS: Grain NTS 1 & Grain NTS 2 (also designated NTS Feeder No.5 and Feeder No. 18). A ship reloading facility was added to the terminal in 2015 to enable shippers to take advantage of competitive world prices. A truck loading facility was commissioned in 2015 to transfer LNG directly to filling stations. Grain LNG Ltd does not own the LNG or the gas that it handles but charges for gasifying it. Current (2016) users include BP, Centrica (British Gas Trading), Iberdrola (Spain), Sonatrach (Algeria), Engie (France), and Uniper (Germany). To ensure that the quality of gas entering the NTS meets the requirements of the Gas Safety (Management) Regulations 1996 the terminal has LNG blending facilities. There is a propane storage and blending unit to increase the calorific value of the gas entering the NTS if required. If necessary natural gas can be ballasted with nitrogen to reduce its Wobbe Number; there are two liquid nitrogen plants (owned and operated by Air Products) with a storage capacity of 5,000 tonnes of liquid nitrogen. Grain LNG is classified as an Upper-Tier site under The Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) Regulations 2015. A siren is installed in Grain village (north-west of the site) that would be used in the event of an incident occurring at the Grain LNG site that requires the activation of the external emergency plan.

Like its predecessors the AC4 was to have a one piece cast hull and turret. The AC4's most important characteristic would be the use of a 17 pounder tank gun. History AC E1 development vehicle with a test turret and 17 pounder gun Reservations about the utility of the 25 pounder in the AC3, and the 25 pounder's limited ability to pierce armour led to experimentation with a 17 pounder mounted on an Australian cruiser. A turret was built and mounted on one of the earlier development vehicles to assess the vehicle's ability to mount the foremost Allied anti-tank gun of the day ‚Äì the British 17 pounder (76 mm, 3 in). This was achieved by mounting two 25 pounder gun-howitzers which when fired together would significantly exceed the recoil of a 17 pounder. In this configuration the tank was tested on 2 November 1942. It fitted with a 17 pounder and after successful gunnery trials on 17 November 1942 the 17 pounder was selected for the AC4 design. For the AC4 the 17 pounder was to be mounted in a new and larger turret, attached by a 70-inch (1778 mm) diameter turret ring, the space for which was accommodated by changes to the upper hull permitted by the compact nature of the \\"Perrier- Cadillac\\". A design for the tank had been established, however it was subject to a redesign to alter the internal stowage, and include new features not previously considered such as removal of the turret basket, addition of a gyro-stabiliser, and swapping a hydraulic traverse for the electrical system, and torsion bar suspension for the volute spring used up until that point. The programme was authorised to build a total of 510 AC4 tanks. The design was not yet finalised when the programme was terminated in July 1943.

Like the Sentinel the AC3 featured a one piece cast hull and turret. The AC3 featured a much improved design over the AC1 with better armour protection, a more powerful engine, and most importantly increased firepower. The program was terminated in 1943 before any production vehicles were completed. History Even before the AC1 Sentinel began rolling off the assembly line in August 1942 it had been seen that the 2 pounder was becoming less effective as tank armour increased in thickness on new and improved enemy tanks. To address this a 25 pounder (87.6 mm, 3.45 in) gun-howitzer was fitted to a turret on the second prototype Australian cruiser tank hull and successfully test fired on 29 June 1942. With this success decided to use the 25 pounder as a tank gun. The 25 pounder, redesigned as a tank gun, was tested on 10 October 1942, the work on the overhead recoil system would later prove useful for the design of the Short 25 Pounder. Mounted in a fully traversable turret larger than that of the AC1 but using the same turret ring, it was slightly cramped for the turret crew but gave the AC3 both armour-piercing capability as well as an effective high explosive round. The 40 volt electrical turret traverse system of the AC1 was replaced by a more powerful 110 volt system. The hull machine gun and gunner were removed from the design to make room for stowage of the larger 25 pounder ammunition. Powered by the same three Cadillac V8 engines as the AC1, they were now mounted radially on a common crank case and geared together to form the \\"Perrier-Cadillac\\", a single 17.1 L, 24 cylinder engine, very similar in some respects to the later A57 Chrysler multibank used in some variants of the US M3 and M4 tanks. While the AC3 shared the same armour basis as the AC1, the hull profile had been greatly redesigned to improve the ballistic shape. The programme was authorised to build a total of 200 Thunderbolts. Although only one pilot model AC3 had been completed, large scale production of components had been ordered and 150 AC3 hulls cast. New South Wales Government Railways' production line at Chullora work had started on assembling the first 25 AC3 tanks for trials when the programme was terminated in July 1943.  Survivors  The Australian War Memorial's AC3 in 2013 At the end of World War II all but three Australian Cruiser tanks were disposed of by the Australian government. The 65 tanks that were not required to serve as a physical record in war museums in Australia and the UK were sold off by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. One of the three saved was the only completed AC3 (serial number 8066) which is now located at the Treloar Resource Centre at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. An AC3 mockup was assembled from unused AC3 armour castings and a mix of AC3 and AC1 parts at the Melbourne Tank Museum in 1996‚Äì97, this piece was sold to a private collector in 2006.

Bianconi - who hailed from Umbria - joined the order in his adolescence and dedicated his pastoral career to his flock and on one notable occasion aided refugees when Frederick II sacked the area in 1248. He also combatted heresies and managed to convert one of their chief propagators while also distinguishing himself through his life of extreme poorness that went past the Dominican standards. The difficult road to sainthood commenced under Pope Paul V in 1608 and stalled several times until Pope Urban VIII decided to preside over the beatification in 1641 - the process had failed then and the pontiff's death exacerbated the prospect of the process never facing completion. It reopened one final time and allowed - on 18 May 1672 - for Pope Clement X to confirm Bianconi's beatification on the recognition of the late priest's local 'cultus' - or popular veneration. Life Giacomo Bianconi was born on 7 March 1220 in Umbria. His birth spouted a miracle when - as he was born - three brilliant bright stars containing three separate images of friars amongst the clouds: these individuals were later confirmed as Bianconi himself as well as Thomas Aquinas and Ambrose of Siena. In his childhood he achieved peace between two quarreling families. Bianconi became a member of the Order of Preachers in Spoleto in 1236 during his mid-adolescence after meeting two Dominican friars preach during Lent. He decided to choose an extreme life of poorness that exceeded Dominican standards. He founded - and became the first prior at the same time - of the convent in Mevania. Bianconi aided survivors and refugees from Mevania in 1248 after Frederick II sacked the town in 1248. He helped to quash the Nicolaites heretical movement in Umbria and scored a success for the opposition when he managed to convert its chief propagator named Ortinellus. Bianconi became provincial minister for the order in 1281 and later made the prior of all Dominican friaries in Spoleto in 1291 and in Foligno in 1299. He became active in the rebuilding of the town which culminated in the rebuilding of the Palazzo dei Consoli in 1270. In 1291 he received approval to rebuild the church of San Giorgio in Mevania and to construct an adjoining convent to it and he later founded two nunneries known as Santa Lucia and Santa Margherita. He served also as the lector at San Domenico in Orvieto and became the spiritual advisor of Jane of Orvieto. Father Bianconi once knelt before a crucifix and experienced doubts about his personal salvation and at that moment blood spurted from it which led to the voice of Jesus Christ tell the priest that the blood was a sign that he would be saved. On another occasion his mother was so shocked at the poor condition of his habit that she gave him the funds needed to purchase another though her son wanted to purchase a crucifix for his cell. But his mother reminded him he had to purchase a habit instead with Bianconi assuring her that the garment he wore before her was the one he purchased using her gift. Bianconi died on 22 August 1301. Both Saint George and Saint Dominic appeared to him as he died as well as the Madonna who he believed would take him to Heaven. Before he died he brought fresh water to his cell so he and his companions could drink but ended up drinking wine when the water turned into it. His remains were buried in San Giorgio though his remains were later relocated in 1302 to the counter-fa√ßade of Ss. Domenico e Giacomo to the left of the entrance. Pope Boniface IX offered a papal indulgence to those who venerated his remains during the first week of the fifth month in 1397 as an impetus for potential sainthood. His remains were moved again in 1589 and for the final time to a gilded bronze urn on the high altar in 1686. Beatification Bianconi's cause for beatification commenced in 1608 under Pope Paul V once Cardinal Alfonso Visconti inaugurated the process itself. Cardinal Maffeo Barberini - later Pope Urban VIII - reopened the process after a brief stall in 1612 and led to a formal process being opened in 1632 under three bishops including the Bishop of Spoleto Lorenzo Castrucci. That process too was inconclusive and a second was needed because Urban VIII wanted to preside over Bianconi's beatification in 1641. But that too stalled and the death of the pontiff also halted prospects for beatification. The final process launched in 1658 and this led to the announcement that Bianconi would be beatified. He received beatification from Pope Clement X on 18 May 1672 after the pontiff provided ratification to the late priest's local and enduring 'cultus' - or popular devotion and veneration - thus providing a conclusion to a long and difficult process.

Similar to the official games, Uranium contains both online trading and online battling. In August 2016, after one and a half million downloads, the download links for Pok√©mon Uranium were taken down from the official website because the developers wanted to \\"respect Nintendo's wishes\\", after receiving multiple DMCA takedown notice letters from lawyers representing Nintendo.

It is intended to be used as a tool of evangelisation to deepen the faith of the Catholic faithful within and outside Nigeria. Though yet to acquire a standard TV channel, the Catholic Television is expected to provide all the Catholics the opportunity to evangelise in the future, using the electronic media to reach families in their homes. The Director of the Catholic Television Nigeria is Rev. Fr. Patrick Alumuku. Background For decades, the Catholic Church in Nigeria has desired to reach out to its members and the vast, diverse population of over 170 million people in Nigeria, through the Television network, which is an irresistibly attractive and effective medium for evangelization. To actualize this desire, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Abuja and some dioceses within Nigeria have been producing and airing programmes on Federal, State and Private television stations to their local communities. However, the need for a national coverage of Church activities and evangelization of the population of Nigeria had not been achieved. The quest and desire to utilize a television broadcast network nationwide, to promote and propagate Catholic programmes and activities, as well as build a better and godly society, received a happy and encouraging boost in 2009. It came through an invitation by the chairman/CEO of a private national television company DAAR Communications Plc, (operators of Africa Independent Television AIT), Chief Raymond Dokpesi to John Cardinal Onaiyekan Archbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Abuja, to use one of DAARSAT channels for evangelization. As an immediate and short term response to the opportunity offered by DAARSAT, John Cardinal Onaiyekancharged the Communications Department of the Archdiocese to take up the offer and ensure that the Catholic Church had an effective presence on television. This project also received the approval of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Nigeria (CBCN). This informed the establishment of a capital intensive yet highly desirous Communications Ministry through television: THE CATHOLIC TELEVISION OF NIGERIA (CTV). The project took off with the broadcast of a fifteen-minute devotional programme titled ‚ÄúA Light For The Nation‚Äù at 05.45am on January 1, 2010, on Africa Independent Television. Vision The Vision of CTV is to create a world in which the love of God and love of neighbour reign supreme, through being the most powerful and effective Catholic media organization in Africa. Mission The Mission is to promote evangelization through being the authentic source of information and education on Catholic faith, teachings and values for a godly society. CTV is dedicated to evangelization by communicating with conviction to the Catholic community and the wider society, through the use of Television, Radio and the Internet. The Director of the CTV, Fr.Patrick Tor Alumuku said that the ultimate goal of the Catholic Television was to promote human dignity, love, respect and peace for all, especially in the wake of rising violence in the country. He explained that the Catholic Television Programming was not solely on religion but also on matters that positively shape other aspects of human life. The CTV project has been planned for implementation in stages towards the 24 hour broadcast target. Every stage depends on the financial support received from committed Catholics and friends of the Church since the CTV does not receive subvention from anywhere. Local funding Sources The Abuja Archdiocesan community through parishes and individuals have since the inception of the CTV been assisting in the area of sustainability with respect to staff salaries, transport, tapes, batteries, microphones, computers, and so on. The CTV usually have an end of year fundraising event to help kick-start every new year. Programs of the CTV The Programs of the Catholic Television Nigeria, include: ‚ÄúA Light For The Nation‚Äùhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuV7JIR3LLw and \\"Faith in Action\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_hh-kSbt9A ‚ÄúA Light For The Nation‚Äù is a daily devotional programme which features reflections on diverse topics on Catholic faith and good living, by the Clergy, Religious and Laity from different dioceses in Nigeria. The Programme has been broadcast everyday on the national network of Africa Independent Television (AIT) without interruption from January 2010 to date. \\"A Light for the Nation\\" which is broadcast every day at 05.45 am on AIT has become a very popular day- starter for most viewers as indicated in the feedback. According to the director, \\"We began this in a very small way with a programme on African Independent Television (AIT), called Light for the Nation. It is a programme aimed at making our own contribution towards a brighter future for Nigeria. We also have another programme called Faith in Action. It tries to tell the message that whatever you do, you have done nothing unless you positively affect your brother\\".

Showcase on display at the Eurasian festival Tong Tong Fair 2012. Rice-cooking utensils are tools used for cooking rice and similar foods. Dedicated rice-cooking utensils have a long history. A ceramic rice steamer dated to 1250 BC is on display in the British Museum. Rice cooking methods Rice cooker of the Edo period Fukagawa Edo Museum) Rice absorbs a great deal of water as it cooks, expanding its volume and using up the cooking water. The moisture and heat gelatinize and soften the starch granules in the rice.On Food and Cooking: An Encyclopedia of Kitchen Science, History and Culture, Harold McGee, 2nd ed, pub. Hodder & Stoughton 2004, p 474 The cooking time for raw rice (not parboiled beforehand) ranges from about 15 minutes and up, depending upon the type and freshness of rice, method, and desired result (from separate grains to disintegrated porridge). Some rices, such as white rice, long-grain rice and African rice, break up more easily. Some cooking methods are more likely to break the rice (fragmenting it with a mortar and pestle before cooking, or stirring frequently). Some rice is stickier. Most recipes will therefore not work for all rices. Rice can be cooked by heating in boiling water or steam, or a combination of both (boiling until water evaporates, then continuing in steam generated by continued heating). Rice cooking utensils may be divided into * boiling: dolsot, gamasot, saucepans or pots (risotto pan, porridge pot) * steaming: bamboo steamer, siru, couscousier * boiling and steaming: rice cookers, Asian traditional rice cooker on hearth, i.e., Èáú) ** baking: (paella pan, pilaf pan ** microwaving: ceramic or plastic containers for microwave ovens Cutlery Rice paddles are made specifically to scoop rice. Microwave rice cookers Microwave pot for cooking rice A microwave rice cooker is a container designed specifically for cooking rice. Some container consists of three parts: an outer bowl, a fitted lid with steam vents, and an inner bowl with a finely perforated base. Some others have only one container and the double-layered lid fitted with a steam vent. A measured amount of dry rice is placed within the bowl. For long-grain rice or scented rice (e.g., basmati rice, Thai jasmine rice), neither washing or soaking is usually necessary unless contaminating dirt is suspected. For Japanese rice (e.g., Calrose or medium/short grain rice), the rice is washed to remove surface starch powder and the trace of rice bran from the grains. For washing, a generous amount of water is added to the rice then the mixture is stirred a few times with a hand quickly. The water is then drained immediately while the lighter starch is still in the water, and the heavier rice grains settle at the bottom of the container. The washing process may need to be repeated up to three times until the water draining out is clear of starch. Excessive washing, however, is believed to be detrimental, since it will remove too many water-soluble nutrients, e.g., vitamins. With the three-part model, the inner bowl is then placed within the outer bowl and a small amount of water is added, so that the rice is just about covered. The lid is then fitted and the cooker is microwaved at full power for between 8 and 15 minutes (depending on the rice type, power output of the appliance and personal texture preference). Cooking occurs with the water boiling away and steaming the grains. It is very important to follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding the length of time and amount of water added, otherwise the rice can burn. This method works well with long-grain rice that does not release much starch and is conventionally cooked with the boil/strain or steam methods. Microwave rice cookers can also be used for cooking Japanese rice, or medium- or short grain rice, but the absorption method should be used. The rice is washed well to remove starch and allowed to stand to absorb water for at least 15 min before cooking. The water absorption step is essential, otherwise the cooking may result in cooked rice which is still too hard. The regular amount of water as the conventional cooking method can be used. The container is placed in the microwave and it is brought up to the boil at high power. Then, it can be cooked at low or low-medium power until all the water is evaporated (about 20 min - 30 min, depending on the rice type) and not much steam is coming out. The container is then left to stand for 5 min before the rice is stirred for serving.

Foundation It was founded in 1550 in the name of the Most Holy Crucifix by the nobleman Pietro Tabone, grandfather of the poet Sebastiano Bagolino‚Äôs, who was buried in this Church. In 1542 Tabone, after his request, had a piece of land by the municipality in order to build a Chapel dedicated to the Most Holy Crucifix, patron saint of the town at that time. History The small chapel was built in 1550, without any consent by the Bishop of Mazara del Vallo; it was approved only two years after its construction. Tabone had the right to enlarge, pull down and rebuilt it, besides he could nominate the Rector and found a Confraternity of the Most Holy Crucifix.\\"Parrocchia san Francesco di Paola\\" In 1575 there was a terrible plague: the population in Alcamo, about 7,700, was cut in half, according to the historian Ignazio De Blasi and a lot of people were buried in the cemetery Sant'Ippolito, in the western suburb. As the old hospitals of San Vito and Santo Spirito were not sufficient to receive so many plague victims, they set up a new one in the same street of the Chapel. Owing to their economic difficulties which did not allow to complete the Church, in 1596 the administrators of the Confraternity decided to assign the Church to the Order of Minims of Saint Francis of Paola. In 1608 the Minims accepted the donation and built the adjoining friary which they maintained until 1866; since 1870 it hosted the Royal Gimnasium, and, after 1870, the Civic Hospital. Interior of the church The Minim Fathers distinguished themselves both for their religious activity and for the social engagement for the quarter; in 1780 forty-five priests from Alcamo signed a request to king Ferdinand III asking not to suppress the friary, as it had happened to other religious orders some years before. The cloister was not closed, but after the Unification of Italy, Victor Emmanuel II, king of Italy, abolished all religious orders and their properties were seized. Finally in 1926 the Church became a parish, dedicated to saint Francis of Paola. Works The fa√ßade, dated 1695, has a convex form, a typical characteristic of Rococo Style. The church is with one nave and has five altars; in 1750 it was embellished with stuccoes by Nicol√≤ Curti. Inside it there the following works: Altar of saint Francis of Paola On the high altar: the Crucifix, a wooden sculpture made by Francesco Marino from Trapani in the 19th century. On the left side: * The Holy Trinity (by an unknown author), with the two saints Cosma e Damiano, Saint Rosalia and Saint Francis of Sales (1750), first canvas on the right side of the chapel * Our Lady of Fatima, a recent wooden statue * Saint Blaise, by an unknown author of the 18th century, coming from the Church of the Annunciation * The Holy Heart of Jesus (Sacro Cuore di Ges√π), a wooden statue, placed in 1921 On the right side: * Our Lady of Miracles (Madonna dei Miracoli), with Saint Francis of Paola and Saint Francis of Sales (1750), made by an unknown author * Saint Francis of Paola, a wooden statue, probable work of Filippo Quattrocchi from Gangi (18th century) * Saint Anne, a wooden statue (end of the 19th century) which has replaced a ruined painting made in 1618 by Giuseppe Carrera * The Immaculate, a recent plaster cast statue * Saint Vitus, a wooden statue made in 1848 * A holy water stoup, carved in 1606 by Giuseppe Foti: at the church entrance. On the nave walls there are four old paintings, by an unknown author and with stucco frames, representing some episodes of Saint Francis of Paola's life: * The miracle happened during the building of the friary at Paterno Calabro (province of Cosenza) in 1454: two workers had died owing to a landslide and were resurrected by the Saint (the first on the right). * The wonderful miracle of the fish made by saint Francis of Paola (the second painting on the right) * A nobleman's family presents their baby without eyes and mouth; once again saint Francis makes an extraordinary miracle (first painting on the left wall); * The conversion of the King of Naples, due to the Saint (second painting on the left). * The founding of the Hebraic Easter (book of Exodus), on the right wall of the chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament; * The banquet given by Lot to two Angels (book of Genesis), a painting on the left wall in the same chapel; In the sacristy: * The Crucifix made in mistura, by Giovanni Matinati (1550) * Saint Lucy, a 17th-century statue by an unknown author; * Saint Expeditus, a recent statue * Madonna della Piet√†, a canvas by an uncertain author of the 18th century * Saint Catherine of Siena, painted by an uncertain author of the 18th century * Saint Michael Archangel, an 18th-century statue * Saint Francis of Paola, an 18th- century bust.

She then served as a member of the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA), representing Burundi, from June 12, 2012, until her murder on July 13, 2016. Her current term in the EALA would have expired in 2017. Mossi was born in 1964 in Makamba. An ethnic Hutu, she began her career in journalism at the Channel for Africa in South Africa. In 1998, Mossi moved to London and became a journalist and producer for the British Broadcasting Corporation's (BBC) Swahili service. She returned to Burundi in the mid-2000s. Mossi, who was in her 50s, was shot and killed while leaving her home in the Gihosha commune of the then-capital, Bujumbura, on July 13, 2016, by two gunmen who escaped in a car. President Pierre Nkurunziza called her murder an assassination. Several high-ranking members of the Military of Burundi had been killed in the country since the beginning of the Burundian unrest in April 2015. However, Hafsa Mossi was the first senior politician to be killed during the ongoing political crisis. Observers were puzzled by the motive behind Mossi's murder, since she was not viewed as a CNDD‚ÄìFDD hardliner or stalwart.

It operates under Division C ‚Äì Education, Outreach and Heritage. The IAU states that it is keen to make a distinction between the terms name and designation. To the IAU, name refers to the (usually colloquial) term used for a star in everyday conversation, while designation is solely alphanumerical, and used almost exclusively in official catalogues and for professional astronomy. (The WGSN notes that transliterated Bayer designations (e.g., Tau Ceti) are considered a special historical case and are treated as designations.)  Terms of reference  The terms of reference for the WGSN for the period 2016‚Äì2018 were approved by the IAU Executive Committee at its meeting on 6 May 2016. In summary, these are to: * establish IAU guidelines for the proposal and adoption of names for stars, * carry out a search of the literature for candidate names, * adopt new unique names for stars of scientific and historical value, * assemble and disseminate an official IAU star name catalog. (The current version is titled \\"List of IAU-approved Star Names\\".) While initially the WGSN would focus on incorporating 'past' names from history and culture, in the future it would be responsible for defining the rules and enabling the process by which new names can be proposed by members of the international astronomical community.  Naming guidelines  The WGSN adopted preliminary guidelines for unique star names. In summary, these are: * Names preserving world heritage are strongly encouraged; common and cultural names preferred over new, * Names should normally be 4‚Äì16 characters in length; short names preferred over long, * Names should be pronounceable in some language and be non-offensive, * Names should not be too similar to an existing name of a star, planet, planetary satellite, or minor planet. * Names of individuals are prohibited for bright stars (except for rare historical cases), * Contrived names are discouraged (except for rare historical cases), * Names of events principally known for political or military activities; of a principally commercial nature; of pet animals and acronyms are prohibited. The WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. = Multiple stars = The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. For example, the name Fomalhaut specifically refers to the bright A component of a 3 star system. The informal names often attributed to other components in a physical multiple (e.g., Fomalhaut B) are treated as unofficial (albeit described as \\"useful nicknames\\"), and not included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. In the List, the components are clearly identified by their identifiers in the Washington Double Star Catalog. Where a component letter is not explicitly listed, the WGSN says that the name should be understood to be attributed to the visually brightest component. = Chinese Names = General guidelines for Chinese star names were adopted during 2017. In summary, these are: * The Chinese Sky During the Han: Constellating Stars and Society (Sun & Kistemaker 1997) is considered authoritative with early Chinese name-star identifications and spellings, * adopting of Chinese asterism names for individual stars should be avoided as it would cause confusion, * Pinyin spelling is preferred.  Program of work  The WGSN decided to focus during the rest of 2016 on standardizing common names and spellings for the brightest few hundred stars with published names, and on compiling cultural names, with names for faint stars to be discussed in the future (it regarded 'bright stars' as those with designations in the Bright Star Catalogue and any physical companions; 'faint stars' as any other Galactic stars, substellar objects, and stellar remnants). The main aim for the next few years is to delve into worldwide astronomical history and culture, looking to determine the best-known stellar appellations to use as the officially recognised names. Beyond this point, once the names of many of the bright stars in the sky have been officially approved and catalogued, the WGSN will turn its focus towards establishing a format and template for the rules, criteria and process by which proposals for stellar names can be accepted from professional astronomers, as well as from the general public.  Adopted names  The WGSN's first bulletin dated July 2016 included a table of 125 stars comprising the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN (on 30 June and 20 July 2016) together with names of stars (including four traditional star names: Ain, Edasich, Errai and Fomalhaut) reviewed and adopted by the IAU Executive Committee Working Group on Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign and recognized by the WGSN. Further batches of names were approved on 21 August, 12 September, 5 October and 6 November 2016. These were listed in a table of 102 stars included in the WGSN's second bulletin in November 2016. The next additions were done on 1 February 2017 (13 new star names), 30 June 2017 (29), 5 September 2017 (41), 19 November 2017 (3) and 6 June 2018 (17). All 330 names are included in the current List of IAU-approved Star Names, last updated on 1 June 2018. The first list includes two stars given names of individuals during the NameExoWorlds process: \\"Cervantes\\" for the star Mu Arae (honoring the writer Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra) and \\"Copernicus\\" for the star 55 Cancri A (honoring the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus). The WGSN approved the historical name Cor Caroli (Latin for 'heart of Charles') for the star Alpha Canum Venaticorum, so named in honour of King Charles I of England by Sir Charles Scarborough, his physician.

Oxford University Press, There are 19 Sannyasa Upanishads in the Muktika anthology of 108 Upanishads.Patrick Olivelle (1992), The Samnyasa Upanisads, Oxford University Press, , pages x-xi, 5 They, along with other minor Upanishads, are generally classified separately from the thirteen major Principal Upanishads considered to be from the ancient Vedic tradition. The Sannyasa group of minor Upanishads differ from other groupings, broadly based on their overall focus, even though there are overlaps. They contrast with the Samanya Upanishads which are of a generic nature, the Yoga Upanishads related to Yoga, the Shaiva Upanishads which highlight aspects of Shaivism, the Shakta Upanishads which focus on Shaktism, and the Vaishnava Upanishads which highlight Vaishnavism. Six of the nineteen Sannyasa Upanishads were composed in ancient India, before the 3rd century CE. Others are dated to be from the medieval era. All except one has a strong Advaita Vedanta focus, which state scholars such as Patrick Olivelle may be explained by the fact that the major monasteries of the early medieval period belonged to the Advaita Vedanta, which selected or recast those texts which fitted into their teachings.Stephen H Phillips (1995), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Columbia University Press, , page 332 with note 68Antonio Rigopoulos (1998), Dattatreya: The Immortal Guru, Yogin, and Avatara, State University of New York Press, , pages 62-63 The Sannyasa Upanishads are notable for their descriptions of the Hindu sannyasi (renouncer), his character and his state of existence as he leads the monastic life in the Ashrama tradition. They generally assert that the life of the sannyasi is one of carefree simplicity of compassion for all living beings, of reflection, not rituals, dedicated to Jnana-kanda (knowledge section of the Vedas), finding home when he is in union with truth and perfection.Gananath Obeyesekere (2005), Karma and Rebirth: A Cross Cultural Study, Motilal Banarsidass, , pp. 99‚Äì102 Self-knowledge is his journey and destination, a solitary place his monastery of bliss. They also offer contrasting views on who, how and at what age one may renounce the world for spiritual pursuits. Date Six of the Sannyasa Upanishads ‚Äì Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma ‚Äì were composed before the 3rd-century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era, states Sprockhoff. The Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd-century CE, the Naradaparivrajaka and Satyayaniya Upanishads to around the 12th-century, and about ten of the remaining Sannyasa Upanishads are dated to have been composed in the 14th- to 15th-century CE well after the start of Islamic Sultanates period of South Asia in late 12th-century. Significance Sannyasa Upanishads focus on the monastic traditions within Hinduism. Some of the oldest Sannyasa Upanishads have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook, and these pre-date Adi Shankara. Most of the Sannyasa Upanishads present a Yoga and nondualism (Advaita) Vedanta philosophy. This may be, states Patrick Olivelle, because major Hindu monasteries of early medieval period (1st millennium CE) belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition. The 12th-century Shatyayaniya Upanishad is a significant exception, which presents qualified dualistic and Vaishnavism (Vishishtadvaita Vedanta) philosophy.Antonio Rigopoulos (1998), Dattatreya: The Immortal Guru, Yogin, and Avatara, State University of New York Press, , page 81 note 27 These texts were influential and often discussed by medieval era Indian scholars. For example, states Olivelle, the Jabala Upanishad was mentioned by Adi Shankara in his bhasya on Brahma Sutras, and he did so several times, at 1.2.32, 2.1.3, 3.3.37‚Äì41, 3.4.17‚Äì18 and others.

Members of this gens first appear under the early Empire, when two brothers served as consuls in AD 9. The Roman empress Poppaea Sabina was a descendant of this family, but few others achieved any prominence in the Roman state. A number of Poppaei are known from inscriptions. The name is sometimes confused with that of Pompeia. Origin The consul Gaius Poppaeus Sabinus is said to have come from an undistinguished family, and to have owed his lengthy career more to his competence than his brilliance.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 691 (\\"Poppaeus Sabinus\\"). There is little evidence of the Poppaei prior to the first century, but from inscriptions the family seems to have been concentrated in Campania. The surname Sabinus suggests that they claimed Sabine ancestry.Chase, p. 114. The region of Campania where the greatest number of Poppaei are found was associated with the Samnites, an Oscan-speaking people who also claimed Sabine descent.Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, pp. 1406, 1407 (\\"Samnium\\"). Praenomina The chief praenomina of the Poppaei were Gaius and Quintus. A few of the family used other names, such as Publius, Lucius, Sextus, and Titus. All of these were common names throughout Roman history.

Her husband was implicated in the intrigues of Sejanus, and put to death. Poppaea's second husband was Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio, consul in AD 24. Poppaea's daughter was said to have inherited her great beauty from her mother.PIR, vol. III, pp. 86, 87 (\\"P\\", No. 629). * Poppaea T. f. Sabina, married first Rufrius Crispinus, Praetorian Prefect under Claudius, then Otho, following which she became the mistress of the emperor Nero.

Saturn is portrayed on the obverse while the reverse depicts Victoria crowning Roma. The legend \\"Sex(tus) Noni(us) Pr(aetor) L(udos) V(ictoriae) P(rimus) F(ecit)\\" tells that Sufenas' father, the praetor Sextus Nonius established the Ludi Victoriae Sullanae in 81 BC. The gens Nonia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Its members first appear in history toward the end of the Republic. The first of the Nonii to obtain the consulship was Lucius Nonius Asprenas in 36 BC. From then until the end of the fourth century, they regularly held the highest offices of the Roman state.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 1207 (\\"Nonia Gens\\"). Origin The nomen Nonius is a patronymic surname, based on the praenomen Nonus, presumably belonging to an ancestor of the gens.Chase, p. 151. The name is undoubtedly Latin, although the first of the Nonii to rise to prominence at Rome is said to have come from Picenum.Syme, pp. 63, 64. Another branch of the family seems to have come from Aesernia. Praenomina The chief praenomina of the Nonii were Lucius, Marcus, and Publius, all of which were used by the Nonii Asprenates, while the Quinctiliani used Lucius and Sextus, the latter coming from the Quinctilii, in the maternal line. The Nonii Galli used Marcus and Gaius, while the Macrini used Marcus and Publius. Other praenomina occasionally appear among Nonii whose connection to the main branches of the family, if any, is unknown, including Aulus, Gnaeus, and Quintus. Titus is given in some sources as the earliest ancestor of the Asprenates, solely from the filiation of the consul of 36 BC, but this is very uncertain, and the name is not otherwise found among the Nonii. Branches and cognomina The main surnames of the Nonii were Asprenas, Balbus, Gallus, Quinctilianus, and Sufenas, of which only the last two appear on coins. A few of the Nonii occur without surnames. Asprenas, the name of the most prominent family of the Nonii, and Sufenas belong to a class of cognomen apparently derived from the names of towns that can no longer be identified.Chase, p. 113. Balbus was a common surname, originally given to someone with a pronounced stammer,Chase, p. 110. while Gallus could signify either a Gaul or a cockerel.Chase, p. 114. The Nonii Asprenates emerge into history in the time of Caesar. They remained prominent through the middle of the second century, and the Quinctiliani appear to have constituted a cadet branch of this family. The Nonii Galli were the next family to appear, coming from the town of Aesernia, in the Samnite country, where a Latin colony had been sent at the end of the Third Samnite War.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, vol. I, p. 55 (\\"Aesernia\\"). Beginning in the mid-second century there is a family with the surname Macrinus, a diminutive of the cognomen Macro, a Greek name meaning \\"great\\" or \\"large\\". This family distinguished itself through military and civil service, and evidently obtained patrician rank, as Marcus Nonius Arrius Paulinus Aper was advanced to the office of praetor without having first served as tribune of the plebs.PIR, vol. II, p. 409. Members =Early Nonii= * Aulus Nonius, an opponent of Saturninus and Glaucia, by whom he was murdered in 100 BC, when Nonius was a candidate for tribune of the plebs.Appian, Bellum Civile, i. 28.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Marius\\", 29.Livy, Epitome, 69. * Nonius, a friend of Gaius Flavius Fimbria, who called upon his soldiers to swear to support him against Sulla in 84 BC. Notwithstanding their friendship, Nonius refused the oath.Appian, Bella Mithridatica, 59. * Nonius, a centurion, was murdered by his soldiers in 41 BC, while attempting to quell a mutiny on the Campus Martius in 41 BC.Appian, Bellum Civile, v. 16. * Nonius, placed in charge of one of the gates of Rome during the Perusine War, permitted Lucius Antonius to enter the city.Appian, Bellum Civile, v. 30. = Nonii Sufenates = * Sextus Nonius Sufenas, praetor in 81 BC, he established the Ludi Victoriae Sullanae, the games in honour of Sulla's victory. He was likely the same as Nonius who betrayed Fimbria for Sulla in 84.Paterculus, II, 27. ¬ß 6.Broughton, vol. II, p. 76.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 445, 446. * Marcus Nonius Sex. f. Sufenas, triumvir monetalis in 59 BC. As tribune of the plebs in 56, with two of his colleagues, he prevented the comitia from being held, and new consuls elected. He was tried for this action, but acquitted. He was praetor circa 52, and afterward governor of one of the eastern provinces, perhaps Crete and Cyrenaica or Macedonia.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, iv. 15. ¬ß 4, vi. 1. ¬ß 13, viii. 15. ¬ß 3.Eckhel vol. v, pp, 261, 262.Broughton, vol.

The McKiernans were involved in a running feud with the neighbouring O'Reilly clan. The Annals of Connacht for 1293 state- Fergal O Raigillig, chieftain of Muinter Mailmorda for twelve years, was killed in the midst of his own stronghold by the Tellach Dunchada this year. The Annals of Loch C√© for 1293 state- Ferghal O'Raighilligh, chieftain of Muinter-Maelm√≥rdha during the space of twelve years, was killed in the middle of his own residence by the Tellach-Dunchadha, in hoc anno. In 1301 there was a clash in the McKiernan lands with the O'Reilly and McGovern clans on New Year's Day. It happened in the townland of Aghnacor, parish of Killeshandra, barony of Tullyhunco, County Cavan, but the annals give different dates. Matthew O'Reilly was killed in the clash. He was the son of the Lord of East Breifne Gilla Isu Ruad mac Domnaill O'Raghallaigh (reigned 1293‚Äì1330), and son-in-law of the chief of the McGoverns, Brian ‚ÄòBreaghach‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in (reigned 1272-1294), being married to Brian's daughter Gormlaidh.

Plot A wealthy man gets his son (Balachandar) married to his sister's daughter (Nandini), keeping his promise made to his sister on her deathbed. The young couple are in love, but the marriage does not prove to be satisfying for the husband who believes in romancing his wife all the time. The wife, a responsible homemaker, does not find the time for such, and the frustrated husband becomes smitten by a dancer (Chellam) whose sole aim is to enslave the victim and rob him of his wealth. The neglected, tradition-bound wife is burdened by her father-in-law's death, family responsibilities and the business failing due to her husband's waywardness. The husband is shocked to find that his father has willed that the property would go to him only when he reforms and unites with his wife. Abandoned by his mistress, he becomes mentally disturbed and wanders aimlessly. The wife sells the property to meet her husband's debts, and is eventually forced to live in a hut. However, wisdom dawns on the husband and after many trials and tribulations he learns his lessons and unites with his wife. Cast Credits adapted from The Hindu. * S. Balachandar * S. Nandini * V.

Duignan (1934), \\"The U√≠ Bri√∫in Br√©ifni genealogies\\", pp. 90‚Äì137, in JRSAI Vol. 4, No. 1, Jun. 30, 1934. His grandfather Sithric 'Carrach-in-Cairn' M√°g Tighearn√°n had been a previous chief of the clan. Domhnall's brothers were Matha M√°g Tighearn√°n (d. 1311) whom he succeeded as chief, Conchobar 'Buidhe' M√°g Tighearn√°n who was also a chief, Tom√°s M√°g Tighearn√°n (d.1358) who was also a chief of the clan, Duarc√°n, C√∫ Chonnacht, Cormac, Fergal 'Cend Craiche' and Mathghamhain (d.1314). Description Domhnall's nickname 'An Saithnech' probably meant that he had been fostered in Saitne, now Dunsany, County Meath, by the Ua Cathasaigh clan. Chieftainship On the death of the previous chief, his brother Matha M√°g Tighearn√°n in 1311, Domhnall took the chieftaincy and resided in the castle of Croaghan of the Cups (Irish- Cruachan O'C√∫bhr√°n), now in the townland of Coolnashinny, besides the modern town of Killeshandra. Death Domhnall was murdered in 1312 by Cathal 'na-taisech' √ì Ruairc (d.1329), the same man who murdered his brother Matha M√°g Tighearn√°n in the previous year, so Domhnall may have been trying to get revenge for Matha's death. Cathal's nickname 'na- taisech' meant 'Of the chiefs' because he was the son of Domhnall O'Rourke, Lord of Breifne O'Rourke from 1307 to 1311, and brother to two O'Rourke chiefs, Ualgarg M√≥r √ì Ruairc (reigned 1316-1346) and Flaithbheartach O'Rourke, King of Breifne O'Rourke from 1346-1349 (deposed 1349, died 1352).

The company officially launched in 2013. MDSave connects uninsured patients, health savings account holders, and high deductible health insurance patients with medical providers who offer pre- negotiated savings on medical services.  History  MDsave was founded in 2011 in Brentwood, Tennessee by Paul Ketchel, the current CEO, with the goal of creating the \\"Expedia of Healthcare\\" amidst an increases in high deductible health plans and growing demand for its transparency. Paul Ketchel was formerly chief operating officer of Diagnostics Network Alliance and a director for American Capitol Group. MDSave officially launched in 2013 and was the first online healthcare marketplace. They had raised more than $14 million from investors and earned $5 million in 2015, with investors including MTS Health Partners. By 2015, it was in place in 24 states. Through the company's website, patients can compare local prices for different medical procedures; choose the price and provider that work best for them; and pre- purchase a voucher that covers all expenses. In August 2016, MDSave secured a $5 million investment from Cambia Health Solutions and was doing around 2,000 transactions per month. In May 2019, Gwinnett Medical Center became the first Atlanta-area hospital to partner with MDsave. In June 2018, MDsave began working with St. Cloud Regional Medical Center. At the end of 2018, MDsave had expanded to a network of more than 200 hospitals across 29 states. In March 2020, MDSave announced the appointment of Greg Born, a former global strategy leader for Amazon, as the new company president and COO.  Business model and services  MDsave offers medical providers a way to package their services into a single bundled procedure online, and offers consumers paying out of pocket a way to comparison shop different providers. It is the world's first transactional healthcare marketplace. A patient searches for a treatment or procedure in a location, and MDsave returns a list of providers in that area with price, location and doctor's ratings. A patient purchases the bundled procedure, which includes all associated fees and services, using PayPal, a credit card or a financing plan online. The patient receives a voucher to present to the doctor's office at their first appointment. The providers get paid within six days, versus the average 60‚Äì90 days through insurance. MDsave uses a patented technology that cross-references Medicare billing codes, procedural codes, and diagnosis codes to create an upfront price for the bundled services involved in a single treatment or procedure. = Healthcare cost & access = Through the MDsave marketplace, patients have access to a wide variety of medical procedures at up-front prices, along with simplified billing and educational resources. The prices posted on the site are pre- negotiated with individual doctors or hospitals, and include all costs associated with the procedure, including physician billing; patients do not receive another bill. In November 2018, MDsave partnered with CareCredit, a health, wellness and personal care credit card offered by Synchrony Bank, to offer promotional financing for patients. = Automated episodic care bundling = MDsave works with providers to bundle complex medical procedures into a single upfront payment, which provides consumers with discounted out-of-pocket healthcare bills. = MDsave Plus = MDsave Plus is geared toward employers as a supplement to employee health benefits. MDsave negotiates prices with providers and then passes the savings along to employees, who can save up to 60% on their medical costs.  Providers  MDsave works with hospital groups and ambulatory surgical centers. In 2016 it had a presence in 24 states and 120 markets, and was growing at a rate of 20% month over month. Providers in 2015 included Dignity Health, Catholic Health Initiatives, Community Health Systems, Tenet Healthcare and others.

Khumalo's career in the Department of African Languages of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg began in 1969, when he held a position as a tutor. He advanced to become a professor of African languages and head of the Department of African Languages at Wits. Composer His first composition was Ma Ngificwa Ukufa, which had its premiere in 1959. His compositions consist principally of settings of Zulu texts. His Five African Songs is an arrangement of four traditional songs and one modern tune for choir and symphony orchestra. It has been recorded by the South African National Symphony Orchestra and Chamber Choir of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, conducted by Richard Cock. Two of the five songs are in the Xhosa language, and the other three are in Zulu. The piece has also been orchestrated by Peter Louis Van Dijk. In 1986 he composed a choral work for the enthronement of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Khumalo is also the composer of the cantata uShaka KaSenzangakhona, which tells the story of the Zulu king, Shaka. Khumalo was commissioned by Opera Africa for an opera, resulting in Princess Magogo kaDinuzulu (2002), a work about the Zulu princess, musician and poet Princess Constance Magogo kaDinuzulu. The opera was the first Zulu language opera. He also played a role in producing the official post-apartheid version of the National Anthem of South Africa, at the request of President Nelson Mandela. Works on the phonology of Zulu  Awards and honours In 2015 Wits University awarded him with an honorary doctorate.

Lip bumpers are usually used in orthodontic treatment where the patient has a crowded maxillary or mandibular teeth in an arch. Orthodontics A lip bumper can be used for expansion of the teeth in the mandibular arch. In orthodontics, tooth-size discrepancy phenomenon occurs when there is crowding presented. As a treatment, either extractions of teeth or expansion of the arch can be done to correct the tooth-size discrepancy. A lip bumper is placed in front of the anterior teeth to keep the pressure of the lips and cheeks away from the front teeth and back teeth respectively. As cited by Werner et al., the lip bumper can be used for reduce lower anterior crowding, increase arch circumference, and move the permanent lower molars distally for the purpose of keeping anchorage. Specific changes that occur because of this appliance including anterior teeth tipping forward, molar teeth tipping backwards and the increase in width of the arch formed by the lower teeth. The wire is kept 1.5 - 2.0mm from the front surface of the anterior teeth. Recently, advances have been made to use lip bumpera with mini-screws for distalization of the upper back teeth. A Korn lip bumper is a maxillary lip bumper which was developed by Korn and Shapiro. This lip bumper is made up of .040in stainless steel wire and involves multiple loops. This lip bumper sits high in the maxillary vestibule and 2-3mm away from the attached gingiva. This type of bumper is often used with a bite plate.  Side-effects  Side- effects caused by lip bumpers include the possible disruption in the eruption pattern of the 2nd molars in the mandibular arch. The pressure of the lips on the lip bumper, causes the 1st molar to tip distally which effects and causes the impaction of the 2nd molar. Components Components of lip bumpers include bands on the molar teeth, a thick stainless steel wire with loops made bilaterally and a thick acrylic or rubber shield that goes in the anterior part of the wire to not cause irritation to the mucosa of the lower lip.

It is a geostationary communications satellite designed and manufactured by Hughes (now Boeing) on the HS-601 platform. It was originally ordered by JSAT Corporation, which later merged into the SKY Perfect JSAT Group. It has a mixed Ku band and C band payload and was used as an on orbit spare. Satellite description The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by Hughes on the HS-601 satellite bus. It had a launch mass of , a dry mass of and a 12-year design life. When stowed for launch, its dimensions were . With its solar panels fully extended it spanned , and its width when its antennas were fully deployed was . Its power system generated approximately 5 kW of power due to two wings with four solar panels each. It also had a single NiH2 battery composed of 30 cells and a 200Ah charge. It would serve as on orbit backup for the JSAT fleet. Its propulsion system was composed of an R-4D-11-300 LAE with a thrust of . It also used had 12 bipropellant thrusters for station keeping and attitude control. It included enough propellant for orbit circularization and 12 years of operation. Its payload is composed of four octagonal antenna fed by twelve 36 MHz and sixteen 27 MHz Ku band plus twelve 27 MHz C band transponders for a total bandwidth of 1,296 MHz. Eight of the 36 MHz and the sixteen 27 MHz Ku band transponders have a TWTA output power of 63 Watts, the other four 36 MHz ones have 95 Watts. It can configure four 27 MHz transponders into a single 54 MHz with an effective 125 Watts. The twelve C band transponders have 36 MHz bandwidth and 34 Watts of power. History In December 1995, JSAT ordered its fourth satellite from Hughes, and second of the HS-601 platform, the JCSAT-4. It was an almost copy of the JCSAT-3, also based on the HS-601, but with more powerful transponders. It would have a mixed Ku band and C band payload, a power generation capability of 5,000 Watts and a 12 year of design life. It was expected to be delivered by early 1997 and be positioned at the 124¬∞East longitude. It would provide telecommunications and television services to Japan, all of Asia, Hawaii and Australia and New Zealand. On March 25, 1996, International Launch Services announced a contract with JSAT for the launch of JCSAT-4 aboard an Atlas IIAS. At the time it was expected to launch in January 1997 from Cape Canaveral LC-36A launch pad. This was the second contract of ILS with JSAT after the successful launch of JCSAT-3 in August 1995. On February 18, 1997 at 01:42:00 UTC, and Atlas IIAS launched from Cape Canaveral LC-36B with JCSAT-4 towards a geosynchronous transfer orbit. After the successful launch, it was renamed JCSAT-R. During its tenure as JCSAT-R it operated on the 124¬∞East longitude. On August, 2008, JSAT was merged into the SKY Perfect JSAT Group. In late 2009 Intelsat bought JCSAT-R and rechristened it Intelsat 26. In March 2010, Intelsat announced an agreement with T√ºrksat for loaning Intelsat 26 so the latter could keep its orbital rights until a new satellite could be launched. In July 2010 it was positioned at the 50¬∞East longitude with a 3.4¬∞ inclination. By January 2013 the inclination had increased to 4.6¬∞. In August 2016, the satellite was positioned at 64.1¬∞East with a 6.97¬∞ inclination.

She founded one of the first schools in what would become Wisconsin and was the first woman to teach in a public school in the territory which would be Wisconsin. Early life Electa Quinney was born around 1798 in Clinton, New York, into the Housatonic or Stockbridge tribe. She was schooled at a Quaker school on Long Island, New York, where she spent four years, and in Clinton at the Clinton Female Seminary, which opened in 1814. Later she studied for six years at the women's seminary in Cornwall, Connecticut. She was the sister of John Wannuaucon Quinney who led her tribe west when they relocated from New York to the Menominee lands. Her father was probably Joseph Quinney, a sachem of the tribe while her mother, Margaret, was the daughter of David Nau-nau-neek-nuk who was also a Stockbridge sachem. Quinney's spirit name in her native Mahican language was Wuh-weh-wee-nee-meew Quan-au-kaunt. Career Upon completing her education around 1821, Quinney taught at a mission school in New York for six years. She relocated west around 1827 and by 1828 had established a school at Statesburg, near Grande Kawkawlin. Quinney taught between forty and fifty students at her school, which was the first public school in Wisconsin making her the first woman school teacher in the Wisconsin part of Michigan Territory. She taught 4 classes in a log school house, which was connected with a Presbyterian mission. Though most of her students were Indian, they studied in English and she used standard texts to teach arithmetic, geography, language, oration, penmanship and spelling. In 1832, the Methodists re- established contact with the Oneida Nation after their relocation to Wisconsin. Their first missionary, Daniel Adams, a Canadian Mohawk established a mission school near Green Bay, at which Quinney became the first teacher that same year. Around 1835, Quinney and Adams married and moved to Missouri where they had three sons, Alexander (born 1838), Daniel (born 1840) and John C. Adams (born 1843), who would become a politician and who fought for the overturn of the 1871 Stockbridge-Munsee constitution until 1893 when his efforts finally succeeded. Daniel's mission was with the Seneca Indians, who occupied a tract on the Neosho River in the Missouri Territory and were later moved to a section of the Cherokee Reservation in the northernmost corner of Indian Territory working the Seneca Circuit. Daniel died in 1843, but Adams continued working for the Methodist Mission Service. Adams married a second time with a Cherokee newspaper editor, John Walker Candy, whose Cherokee name was D√¢guwad√¢. His first wife was Mary Ann Watie, sister of Stand Watie. He had begun his career as a printer in New Echota, Georgia first serving as an apprentice on the Cherokee Phoenix. John came to the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory one year prior to the removal to establish the printing office at the Union Mission. In 1840, he printed the earliest volume of Choctaw laws and helped relocate the press to Park Hill, where he printed the 1842 Cherokee Constitution and Laws. John and Adams married on Christmas day in 1845 in the Seneca lands and he remained with the Union Mission press until 1847. John then worked at the Cherokee Advocate when it was established in Tahlequah. In 1855 he became the printer for the Baptist Mission Press. By 1860, the couple had returned to Wisconsin and were living in Stockbridge, though John's 1868 death occurred near Webbers Falls, Indian Territory. In 1880, she was living in Stockbridge with her son John. Quinney died in 1885 in Stockbridge, Wisconsin. She is buried in the Stockbridge Indian Cemetery, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, though her stone is missing. Posthumously, the Electa Quinney Institute for American Indian Education at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee was named in her honor.

Early years Stephen Williams was the second son born on May 14, 1694 to the Reverend John Williams of Deerfield, MA. and Eunice Mather Williams, daughter of the Rev. Eleazar Mather of Northampton, Ma. At the age of nine, he was abducted from his home in Deerfield by a raiding party composed roughly of 40 French soldiers, and about 200 Abenaki, Huron and Mohawk Indians, working with the French in Montreal. The raid took place in the early morning hours of February 29th, 1704, surprising the inhabitants of the frontier town. Two of Stephen‚Äôs siblings were killed along with his mother Eunice, who had just given birth and whose ‚Äústrength of body began to fail her‚Äù after falling into the waters of the Green River.Williams, John. The Redeemed Captive Returning to Zion, or A Faithful History of Remarkable Occurrences of Mr. John Williams (Northampton: Hopkins, Bridgman, and Company, 1853), p. 17. Approximately 112 survivors of the Deerfield attack were marched three-hundred miles along the frozen banks of the Connecticut River into Canada, where Stephen was held by his captors briefly at Fort Chambly (Lake Champlain region), and later marched to Cowass, (now Newbury, Vt.). His captor, a sagamore, named George, took Stephen as a servant and ‚Äúset to various tasks of cutting wood and packing skins and other supplies.‚ÄùDemos, John. The Unredeemed Captive: A Family Story From Early America. (New York: Alfred Knopf 1994), p. 35. Following the hunting season, the band returned to Canada, where Stephen was briefly reunited with his father, who had obtained a temporary release through Governor de Vaudreuil, along with Stephen‚Äôs sister Esther and eldest brother Samuel. However, this was short-lived as Stephen was again held captive at Fort St. Francois (east of Montreal,Canada) where ‚Äúhe suffered much among the Indians‚Äù, and whipped by Jesuits attempting to convert him to Catholicism.The Redeemed Captive Returning to Zion, p. 151. In August 1705, Governor Joseph Dudley of Boston arranged a prisoner exchange for Williams and a few others. He sailed to Boston and arrived on November 21, 1705, where he lived with an uncle in Roxbury until his father and brothers were released in the fall of 1706. Education Williams was educated in the typical manner of children in Deerfield. His father, Rev. John Williams, also taught Stephen to read the Bible and the books contained in his library. Following his release from captivity, Williams resumed his formal education, and in 1709, was admitted as an undergraduate to Harvard College at the age of sixteen. In a small freshman class of six students, Williams studied a typical curriculum of Greek, Hebrew, logic, ethics, politics, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, declamation, and divinity.Medlicott Jr., Alexander Guild. ‚ÄúThe Journals of the Reverend Stephen Williams‚Äù. (PhD. Diss., University of Washington, 1962), p. 26. At Harvard, he received scholarships allotted to needy students, and he received help from his great uncle, Cotton Mather, who shared divinity books from his extensive library collection. Following his graduation from Harvard, Williams settled in Hadley, Massachusetts, where ‚Äúhe taught school for sixteen months.‚ÄùMedlicott Jr., Alexander Guild. ‚ÄúThe Journals of the Reverend Stephen Williams‚Äù. (Ph.D. Diss., University of Washington, 1962), p. 28. Later in life, he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity from Yale College 1741, and also from Dartmouth College in 1773.Williams, Stephen West. The genealogy and history of the family of Williams in America... (Greenfield,MA.:Merriam & Mirick, 1847), p. 84. In 1713, the town of Longmeadow, had been granted precinct status and separated physically and politically from Springfield. In addition, by the spring of 1714, Longmeadow had a population of nearly forty families and petitioned the General Court for the establishment of a meetinghouse. Williams was ordained on October 17, 1716 and began a ministerial career which would last sixty-six years. (He kept a well-chronicled, diary, which was later transcribed in a grant under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration in 1938). Marriage and family Stephen Williams married Abigail Davenport of Stamford, Ct. on July 3rd, 1718. They would have six sons and two daughters, namely John, Stephen, Eunice, Warham, Samuel, Davenport, Martha, and Nathan. Abigail died on August 26th, 1766. Stephen married a second time, on September 6th, 1767 to Sarah Burt‚Äîa widow of Deacon Nathaniel Burt and daughter of David Chapin of Chicopee.Williams, Stephen West. The genealogy and history of the family of Williams in America... (Greenfield,MA.:Merriam & Mirick, 1847), p. 85. Career Throughout his early years as minister, Williams was confronted with an extraordinary number of issues ranging from nagging physical illnesses, witchcraft, building his permanent house, property disputes, disciplining his slaves and servants, and fear of ‚ÄúIndian mischief.‚ÄùMorgan, Edmund S. The Puritan Family: Religion & Domestic Relations in Seventeenth Century New England. (New York: Harper Row Publishers, 1944), p. 98. He was an advocate of the singing of psalms, which was not a widely received practice in the western part of Massachusetts. He also conducted catechisms on a regular basis‚Äîa practice which was reserved for ‚Äúevery father to teach his children.‚ÄùMedlicott, p. 27. The Puritan church had undergone a transformative change in the way its membership was defined. Prior to the synod of 1662, full membership in New England Congregationalism could only be reached by the approval of first-generation adults who decided on the eligibility of its congregation. The half-way covenant, which bound the Longmeadow church, allowed the children of these full members to be admitted provided that they follow the precepts of the religion by receiving the sacrament of baptism and through the ‚Äúownership of the covenant‚Äù by the ritual of confession of faith. If a member of the church engaged in some form of ‚Äúscandalous transgression‚Äù, he might be ‚Äòregenerated‚Äô as a member, providing that he ‚Äúmakes satisfaction.‚ÄùMedlicott, p. 36. By March 1732, Williams began preaching publicly from Scripture, which by his own admission ‚Äúangered some townspeople‚Äù, despite the idea that this practice was beginning to flourish in nearby Westfield (Rev. Nehemiah Bull). In fact, Longmeadow would not allow a pulpit Bible until the nineteenth century.Medlicott., p. 42. The Breck affair Following the death of Reverend Daniel Brewer of Springfield in 1734, Stephen Williams often filled in for the vacant ministry. By August 1734, Robert Breck, a twenty-one year old from Marlborough, Massachusetts, had been accepted by the deacons to take over the church. Following his graduation from Harvard, he was reported by Reverend Thomas Clap of Windham, Ct. of having Arminian ideas‚Äîtoo radical for the established Congregational church. Stephen Williams‚Äô brother, Eleazar, minister of Mansfield, Ct., in a letter to the Hampshire Association of Ministers, concurred with Clap‚Äôs opinion that Breck was not a suitable choice. Stephen Williams was a friend of Breck, and though disagreeing with his theology, had invited him to preach in Longmeadow only one year earlier. For over a year, the controversy continued with Williams attempting to ‚Äúreconcile the Springfield church, Breck, and the Association.Medlicott, p. 45. The battle came to a climax during a Hampshire Association meeting, where charges were leveled at Breck by Thomas Clap, who accused him of preaching heretical and subversive ideas. Breck was arrested by a town constable, but was released on bail. The heart of the matter was not over theology, but over a political issue of ‚Äúthe individual church against an association of ministers.Winslow, Ola Elizabeth. Jonathan Edwards, 1703-1758: A Biography. (New York: The MacMillan Company, 1941), p. 174. Eventually the charges were dropped and Breck was ordained in January 1736. Although Stephen Williams was not directly harmed by defending Breck‚Äôs ordination, he cast his lot with the other ‚Äòriver gods‚Äô along political lines. In a gesture of reconciliation, Breck called upon Williams to preside at his wedding, and toward the end of William‚Äôs life, Breck was summoned by Williams to preach his funeral sermon.Medlicott, p. 50. The great awakening The radical idea of justification by faith alone was beginning to spread throughout the Connecticut River Valley and challenged the orthodoxy of the ‚ÄúOld Light‚Äù ministers from Boston, who continued to believe in the Calvinist idea of salvation owing to absolute predestination. This opened the door to a spontaneous frontier revival movement, where the individual had an impact upon his/her own salvation. Perry Miller described it as a ‚ÄúLockean psychology because word spread about how ordinary people could acquire conversion merely through an idea derived from experience.‚ÄùMiller, Perry. Jonathan Edwards. (Toronto: George J. McLeod, Ltd., 1949), p. 139. Stephen Williams‚Äô diaries are peppered with accounts of his cousin Jonathan Edwards, (who shared blood lines along their mother‚Äôs side), being invited to preach in Longmeadow, and Williams travelling to East Windsor, Ct. to do the same for Edwards‚Äô father Timothy. In a glimpse of what was to become the First Great Awakening (1740-1743), twenty-four year old Stephen Williams witnessed the ‚Äòharvest of souls‚Äô after observing his grandfather, the Rev. Solomon Stoddard, preaching about \\"the Lord‚Äôs Great Goodness.\\"Williams, Stephen. Stephen Williams Diary, Book I, p. 22. By March 1734, Stephen Williams travel had become more extensive as he ‚Äúpreached at Enfield (an ye Rev. Mr. Reynolds preached here). I hope and pray such interchanging may be of reall service to our people as well as ease to us de [sic:deity].‚ÄùS.W. Diary, Book II, p. 5. There is little doubt that Stephen Williams became an ardent supporter of religious revivalism. Following a dramatic and emotional sermon, his son Samuel came to him weeping and asking for prayers, leading Williams to send for a doctor, fearing for his son‚Äôs mental and physical condition. Emotional unrest in the village coincided with an increase in membership as Williams noted, ‚ÄúFive persons joined to your Church this day.‚ÄùS.W. Diary, Book II, p. 9. However, by June 1734, a number of suicides were recorded following the emotional deliverances of ministers in the valley. Jonathan Edwards‚Äô uncle, Joseph Hawley of Northampton, cut his own throat presumably after being ‚Äúthrown into despondency by Edward‚Äôs preaching.‚ÄùMiller, p. 103. In Longmeadow, where Stephen Williams was ‚Äúpreaching upon death‚Äù in his Sabbath morning sermon on June 13th, 1735, ‚ÄúNathaniel Burt 2nd cut his own throat‚Äù following the afternoon exercises.S.W. Diary, Book II, p. 31. A larger, more zealous revival took hold in the 1740s, mostly embraced by young people actively listening to advice, avoiding loitering, eschewing the taverns, and avoiding ‚Äòlewd practices‚Äô, (defined as company-keeping, frolicking, and social gatherings). At this time, George Whitefield, an evangelical minister from England, visited Williams, Edwards, and others on many occasions. Whitefield was invited to the Williams‚Äô home in Longmeadow and to preach at the meetinghouse. On October 20th, Williams travelled with Whitefield to Westfield, MA. and Suffield, CT., where he heard him ‚Äúpreach to great auditory-he is a warm fervent preacher- has an inimitable faculty of touching ye affections & passions.‚ÄùS.W. Diary Book III, p. 331. Religious conversion now seemed to parallel Edwards‚Äô view of being ‚Äúcentered in the emotions‚Äù as unorthodox expressions of public tears, laughter, shouting, and shaking became commonplace.Tracy, Patricia J. Jonathan Edwards, Pastor: Religion and Society in Eighteenth Century Northampton, (New York: Hill and Wang, A Division of Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1979), p. 114 On July 8th, 1741, Williams was accompanied by ‚Äònew light‚Äô ministers Eleazar Wheelock(Lebanon, CT,) and Joseph Meacham(Coventry, CT.) to hear the legendary ‚ÄúSinners in the hands of an angry God sermon‚Äù, delivered by Jonathan Edwards. Williams described the sermon as ‚Äúmost awakening‚Äù accompanied by a great moaning & crying out throughout ye whole house‚Ä¶so that ye minister was obliged to desist..shrieks and crys were piercing & amazing.\\"S.W. Diary, Book III, p. 375. In all, about forty new members were admitted to the Longmeadow church during the height of the Great Awakening (1741-1742).Foster, Mary Catherine ‚ÄúHampshire County, MA. 1729-1754: A Covenant Society‚Äù, (PhD. Diss. University of Michigan, 1967, p. 114) Later years In 1745, Massachusetts Governor William Shirley asked Williams to join Colonel Joseph Dwight‚Äôs regiment as a chaplain during King George‚Äôs War. Combat was limited to fighting at Louisberg, the British outpost on Cape Breton Isle. Williams served from July to November 1745, became ill with dysentery at the camp, and was returned to Boston, where he convalesced for three months. During the French and Indian War (1755-1763), Stephen Williams was again summoned to serve as chaplain in July 1755, and was stationed at Lake Champlain at Fort Crown Point. In September, his regiment was attacked by French and Indians. Later Williams was asked by Brigadier General Joseph Dwight to be the chaplain for an expedition to Lake George. After the British victory was secured, Williams contracted diarrhoea and jaundice and returned home to Longmeadow. Williams demanded and received full back pay for his time served in Nova Scotia during the war. Reflecting upon the new prosperity of the 1750s, Williams commented ‚ÄúMany new shoe buckles & fine silk scarves at the Assembly‚Äù and added that none of the congregation seemed ‚Äúto be growing thinly about the bodies.‚ÄùStoler, Margaret. ‚ÄúLong Meddowe Days‚Äù, p. 32. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, Williams took a Royalist stance, angering many in the town. However, he did give blessings to the militia heading for Lexington and Concord in April 1775. Longmeadow, itself, was a quartering town for troops heading north and south during the Revolution, yet a small group of radicals dressed as Indians drew Williams‚Äô condemnation. The revolutionaries staged their own ‚Äòtea party‚Äô by ransacking the general store of ‚ÄòMarchant‚Äô Colton, spilling out flour, sugar, and nails. Toward the end of the war, Williams became more sympathetic toward the American cause of liberty, and often prayed for the local men involved in the battles with the British. Until the day he died on June 10, 1782, Stephen Williams ‚Äú..continued to preach his Sunday sermons, deliver the Sacrament and the weekly lecture, visit the infirm and counsel the young.‚ÄùMedlicott, p. 110.

Pasties (known locally as pastes), were introduced to the region by Cornish miners in the 19th century and are still made by their descendants. Traditional recipes may be followed, but often the ingredients today reflect local preferences. The annual festival attracts thousands of visitors, who may also visit the Cornish Pasty Museum and attend other cultural events. Background Paste shop in Real del Monte The municipality of Pachuca has a long history of gold and silver mining, but during the Mexican War of Independence (1810‚Äì21) much of the infrastructure was destroyed and many of the mines became flooded. A group named the Real del Monte Company was formed in 1824 and arranged to bring mining equipment and experienced miners from Cornwall. After landing on Mocambo beach, south of Veracruz, the miners took 14 months to struggle through swamps and rain forests to Real del Monte. The Cornish brought cultural traditions that included football, wrestling and baking pasties. Although the Cornish community shrank after the 1911 revolution, some Cornish names survive. There are buildings and houses with European architecture, including Francis Rule's Methodist Church. In 2008 the Cornish Mexican Cultural Society helped arrange for Real del Monte and Redruth in Cornwall to be twinned. Today many establishments in Pachuca bake pasties. The growth of shops selling pasties coincided with the decline in mining as residents looked for other ways to make a living. A paste may have \\"classic\\" meat, potato and turnip filling, perhaps with additional herbs and jalape√±o, and may also be filled with red or green mole, pineapple, shredded pork or chicken in chilli or even fish. Sweet fruit pastes may contain pineapple, strawberry and blackberry. History Pastes Kiko's, a pastes chain in Pachuca Mexico The 3-day International Pasty Festival was launched in Real del Monte in October 2009. Mar√≠a Oralia Vega Ort√≠z, Hidalgo tourism secretary, opened the festival. Richard Williams, president of the Sociedad Cornish Mexicana, was among those present. Thirteen paste companies participated. Commercial stalls sold the savoury snacks on the main streets of the town. Fillings included tongue, brain, sausage, beans and yellow cheese. There were teething troubles, as when customs officials confiscated swedes that were being imported as an essential ingredient for authentic pasties. The October 2011 festival attracted about 20,000 visitors. In November 2011 Real del Monte opened the first Cornish Pasty Museum in the world, organised by the town's Cornish Culture Council. Before the museum was opened a group from The Regulatory Council for the Cornish Heritage of Real del Monte visited Cornwall on a week-long fact finding mission and met with the Cornish Pasty Association. The fourth annual \\"International Paste Festival\\" was held on 12‚Äì14 October 2012, supported by the government of the state of Hidalgo. Visitors were invited to view pre-Columbian archaeological sites, mines and the English Cemetery. Eight companies engaged in making pastes participated in the festival. In May 2013 Juan Renato Olivares, Hidalgo tourism minister, visited Cornwall to try to encourage the people of Cornwall to visit Mexico. He said \\"The Mexicans are immensely proud of their extraordinary links with Cornwall as so many of the descendants of the original miners live in Mexico ‚Äì people with wonderful names such as Enrique Pengelly and Raoul Pascoe.\\" In September 2013 Victor Aladro, the president of the Cornish Mexican Pasty Association, was with a delegation that toured Heartlands in Pool, Cornwall, where he was given a Cornish Mining World Heritage Site sign. The sign was to be unveiled at a ceremony celebrating mining during the forthcoming International Pasty Festival. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall visited Real del Monte in 2014. They visited the Pasty Museum, where the couple made pasties. The 7th Festival Internacional del Paste was held on 9‚Äì11 October 2015 in Real del Monte. The festival had developed into one of the largest in the state, providing an opportunity for marketing products and services of the tourism and food industries. It included artistic and cultural events, and the opportunity to savour the local pasties, or pastes.

She was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in 2000. Education and personal life Mary Goodrich was born in Hartford, Connecticut on November 6, 1907 to Ella E. (Reed) Goodrich and James Raymond Goodrich. Her grandfather Elizur Stillman Goodrich ran the Hartford‚ÄìNew York Steamboat Company and the Hartford‚ÄìWethersfield Horse Railway. She attended the Collegio Gazzola in Verona, Italy, and Gibbs College before moving on to Columbia University. In 1940, she married Carl D. Jenson, with whom she had two children. Career as pilot and journalist Jenson earned her pilot's license in 1927, at the age of 20, thereby becoming the first woman in Connecticut to achieve that milestone. While she was still training for her pilot‚Äôs license, she also pursued a career in journalism. The Hartford Courant hired her as its first aviation editor on condition that she obtain her pilot's license before a rival reporter for the Hartford Times, which she did. She would later become the first woman to have a bylined column in the paper. A year after obtaining her license, Jenson bought her first plane, a Fairchild KR-21 single-engine biplane. She competed in air shows in events such as racing and ‚Äúbomb throwing,‚Äù which involved dropping bags of flour at ground targets. In the late 1920s, a group of women pilots formed a national organization called the Ninety-Nines to provide support for women in aviation. Jenson was one of the 99 charter members of the group. Jenson was a director of the short-lived Betsy Ross Air Corps (1929‚Äì1933), which was founded during the Depression to support the Army Air Corps, though it was never formally recognized by the U.S. military. Jenson flew her biplane all around the state and around 1933 became the first woman to fly solo to Cuba. Due to failing vision, she lost her flying license after the Cuba trip. Post-flying career In 1936, Jenson was a passenger on the Hindenburg airship for a flyover of Hartford during its first and only full year of service. In the later 1930s, Jenson briefly worked for Walt Disney Productions in California, especially on the film Dumbo. It was there that she met her future husband. In 1941, they moved to Wethersfield, Connecticut, where Jenson became heavily involved in civic volunteerism. She founded and served as president for the town's Women‚Äôs Association and also served on the Board of Education and the Council of Social Agencies of Greater Hartford. Mary Jenson died in Hartford in early 2004. Legacy Jenson's family established a memorial fund in her honor at the Wethersfield Historical Society, which holds numerous historical objects and artefacts from Jenson and her family.

Both events were held in Pyeongchang, Gangwon, South Korea. Soohorang is a white tiger and Bandabi is an Asiatic black bear. The mascots were selected through a national tender process held in 2014 and were approved of by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on June 2, 2016. Selection On June 27, 2014, the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee notified the public of their mascot selection contest. The selection process took place from September 15, 2014 to September 30, 2014. On June 2, 2016, the International Olympic Committee approved the mascots for the games. Characteristics Horang-i (tiger) and Kkachi (magpie) = Soohorang = Soohorang is the mascot of the 2018 Winter Olympics. \\"Sooho\\" means \\"protection\\" in Korean, symbolizing the protection offered to the athletes, participants and spectators at the Winter Olympics, as well as preserving the world peace that is the spirit of the Olympic Games. \\"Rang\\" derives from \\"Ho-rang-i\\", the Korean word for \\"tiger\\"; it is also the last letter of \\"Jeongseon Arirang\\", a cherished traditional Korean folk song of Gangwon Province. Soohorang took its motif from the white tiger, known as \\"baekho\\" in Korean, which is considered to be Korea‚Äôs sacred guardian animal. Its colour is also indicative of the snow and ice of winter sports. Tigers have long been a notable aspect of Korean folklore and culture. Baekho, the white tiger, is described in myths and narratives as a divine imaginary animal that watches over the mountains and nature. A cultural symbol for prosperity and protection, Baekho is revered as a god who cares for humanity, praying for the peace and well-being of the village in Korean folklore, while maintaining the continuity of Hodori which was the mascot of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. It has also been noted that Baekho is in harmony with the Winter Games that take place in \\"the white fields of snow\\". In summary, Soohorang is full of \\"passion and enthusiasm\\" and \\"a strong personality that protects the people who participate in the Olympics.\\" = Bandabi = Bandabi is the mascot of the 2018 Winter Paralympics. It is a symbol of will and courage. \\"Banda\\" means \\"half-moon\\" or a \\"half-moon beast\\", and \\"bi\\" means to celebrate the competition. Bandabi is a warm-hearted friend who \\"has strong will and courage, is at the forefront of equality and harmony,\\" and supports the enthusiasm of the players in the Paralympics so that they can overcome their limitations. Bandabi also has a continuity with Gomdoori, which was a mascot at the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul. Media =Emoticons= Soohorang and Bandabi are available as animated emoticons in KakaoTalk, a popular messaging, texting, or communication application in South Korea. Reception The public reception to the mascots has been described as overwhelmingly positive. According to Hannah Keyser, a writer for sports news website Deadspin, the mascots could be found \\"everywhere\\" during the Olympics, and they were \\"surprisingly universally beloved\\". Dan McQuade, another writer for Deadspin, commented that it will be difficult for the Tokyo 2020 mascots to match the popularity of Soohorang and Bandabi.

On the subway, she encounters an old friend, and begins to reminisce. She remembers being an 8 year old girl moving with her father and younger brother to Brooklyn from Tennessee after the death of her mother. The book then follows August through her teenage years.

A floating, jellyfish-like organism with quadripartite nuclei, it is capable of siphoning an undetectable life energy from any life form, generally causing the death of the victim in the process. This energy can also be extracted from the Metroid in turn, allowing it to be used as a living power source.According to the \\"Logbook\\" description obtained by using the Scan Visor on an Infant Tallon Metroid in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. Though Metroids are often described as parasites, their nature of immediately devouring all lifeforms more closely resembles that of a predator.  Characteristics  Metroids are throughout the series shown to be highly adaptive to outside stimuli. The original Metroid established that exposure to beta rays would cause Metroids to multiply very quickly. Metroid II: Return of Samus and the remake Metroid: Samus Returns established a five-stage life cycle in which those Metroids native to their home planet SR388 go through two stages of ecdysis followed by two stages of mutation, thus maturing through five previously unknown forms: Alpha Metroid, Gamma Metroid, Zeta Metroid, Omega Metroid, and the uncommon Queen Metroid (the latter as the primary antagonist of the game). They are frequently shown to be vulnerable to ice- based weaponry such as the Ice Beam and freeze guns. These weapons can freeze most Metroids instantly, and often all it takes to finish them off after this is a strong impact such as one from a missile. The Metroids were originally bio-engineered by a faction of the ancient Chozo race in order to combat the X Parasites on SR388, but they turned against their masters, forcing the latter to leave the planet.  Appearances  Metroids appear in almost all games in the Metroid series. One particular Metroid, the Baby Metroid that imprints on Samus Aran after she destroys the Metroid Queen in Metroid II: Return of Samus, becomes an important character in later games. They also made an appearance in Kirby's Dream Land 3, the Kid Icarus series (under the name \\"Komayto\\"), and in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.  Reception  Game Informer called the Metroid their favorite alien race in video gaming, praising how their appearance is \\"truly alien\\" and that they \\"pose an immediate and real danger\\" when they appear. Hardcore Gaming 101 called their design \\"iconic\\", and praised their first appearance in the original Metroid, saying that it was \\"a moment of shock and terror almost unlike anything in any other NES game\\", especially if the player did not know how to beat them.

The prevalence of the girl child labour in Nigeria is largely due to household wealth but other factors such as the educational accomplishment of parents, peer pressure and demand factors such as high demand for domestic maid and sex all contribute to the high incidence of girl child labour in the country. In addition, in many rural and Muslim communities in Northern Nigeria, children are sometimes asked to aid religiously secluded women or mothers in running errands. Many girls work as maids, shop helps and street hawkers. The use of young girls in economic activities exposes them to the dangers and other problems such as sexual assault, missing classes, lack of parental care and exploitation. In addition, the work of girls is not recognized by law and any form of employee benefit is negligible. Background Starting in the mid-1980s, the adverse economic conditions in Nigeria, a country where men constituted the majority of the employees in the formal sector forced many women to increase their engagement in the informal sector but labour-intensive sector so as to supplement household income and this is accomplished while working on domestic duties. In Nigeria, strategies undertaken by women in the informal sector include working long hours in the markets and using their children to hawk goods on the streets to reduce the burden. Apart from missing classes, many girls face health and safety risk including exhaustion, attempted sexual assault and kidnapping. Since the beginning of the Structural adjustment Programme in Nigeria, Nigeria went through a period of economic hardship where families had to improvise new strategies to survive, among which were child trafficking and sending children to the cities as house girls. =Socialization= In many rural communities, girl child labour has been part of the process and is believed to aid girls in developing home skills, helping others and family solidarity. Activities include gathering fire wood. As such socialization is a major reason girls are preferred to boys in the recruitment of maids. However, those types of work do sometimes impede the educational prospect of the girls. In some Northern Nigerian Fulani communities, the girl-child helps her mother by hawking milk or other produce from their family farm or made by the mother. Forms of work =Domestic helps= Due to division of labor according to gender in households and also because of socialization, many Nigerian households prefer to use girls as maids. The girl child domestic help in Nigeria are girls aged under 15 who work as maids in the households of families who are in a higher income bracket that those of their parents. In return, the wealthier family pays her or her parents or provide her training in some skill. However, the domestic maid face different challenges in this new environment including child abuse and sexual assault. In some instances, some of the girls are under the age of 8, In Nigeria, most of the girls are from the Southern and Middle Belt regions. The demand for domestic helps in Nigeria and nearby African countries has increased the incidence of child trafficking. This process is enhanced by the invisibility of girls in domestic work because it is considered normal in many urban households. To source for domestic helps organized networks go to towns and villages in Southern states like Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Imo, Cross River, Ekiti and Oyo to procure the services of children who are then transported to other states for domestic work. In 1999, a boat carrying children from Akwa Ibom to Gabon was intercepted by the police. =Street hawking= Many girls below the age of 15 engage in the vending of goods on roads, carriage of goods to customers and begging of alms. On average, more primary and secondary school age girls engage in street trading than boys. The young girls choose specific routes and road junction to vend goods before returning home in the evening. Apart from hawking, some girls also engage in street begging sometimes known as al majeri in the North. Problems About 8% of girl hawkers have been subjected to sexual abuse including cases of rape and sexual violence.Tinuola Femi. \\"The challenges of girl-child education and alternative jobs in Nigeria\\". Corvinus Journal of Sociology and Social Policy 1:101-121. P. 114 Young girls are also exposed to adult challenges and deviant behavior at an early age while having time for to attend classes and complete school work. Apart from exposures to health risk, child abuse and sexual assault, girl child labor in Nigeria has led to an increase in adolescent age commercial sex work exposing the girls to vagaries of street life at an early age. Some young girls are trafficked by organized networks who lie to the girls and their parents that they will be house maids in the city.

Buller (also known as Marion Buller Bennett) is a First Nations jurist in British Columbia. Judge Buller served as the Chief Commissioner for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. A member of the Mistawasis First Nation, she was the first First Nations woman to be appointed to the Provincial Court of British Columbia in 1994, and presided in courts throughout B.C. She established the First Nations Courts of British Columbia in 2006 and provided the foundation for the Aboriginal Family Healing Court in 2016. Buller served as President of the Indigenous Bar Association and served as Director of the B.C. Law Court Society, B.C. Law Foundation, B.C. Police Commission and the B.C. Mediators Roster. Buller has lectured and written numerous articles and papers about Aboriginal law, criminal law, family law and human rights. Career Judge Marion Buller attended the University of Victoria where she received a BA in Anthropology in 1975 and later graduated with her LLB in 1987. Buller‚Äôs career in law was nothing far from noteworthy; she was instrumental in facilitating several organizations regarding indigenous rights, women‚Äôs rights, Aboriginal law, family law and human rights. From 1988-1994, Buller worked as a civil and criminal lawyer in British Columbia. In 1994, Buller was appointed to the Provincial Court bench, making her the first female indigenous Judge in British Columbia. During her legal career, Buller worked as both president and director of Canada‚Äôs Indigenous Bar Association; a national nonprofit association of First Nations, M√©tis, and Inuit persons in Canada trained in the field of law. Membership includes judges, lawyers, political leaders, academics, articling and law students. She also has been an active member of several other organizations such as the B.C. Police Commission, the BC Mediators‚Äô Roster, the Law Foundation of B.C. and the Law Courts Education Society - a nonprofit organization that provides educational programs and services regarding the justice system in Canada. Among the many other milestones mentioned of Buller‚Äôs career, in 2006, she was established the First Nations Court of British Columbia; a criminal sentencing court which uses restorative justice and traditional ways to reach balance and healing. Judge Buller also developed the foundation for the Aboriginal Family Healing Court, a Court to address the return of Indigenous children to their families. Judge Buller has written notable papers and articles which aimed to highlight the inconsistencies within the Justice System regarding indigenous rights, women‚Äôs rights, Aboriginal law, etc. She has also worked as the Commission Counsel for the Cariboo-Chilcotin Justice Inquiry which examined the relationship between the Cariboo-Chilcotin people and the justice system. In 2016, Buller retired from her position as Judge at the Provincial Court of British Columbia. After retiring from her successful career in the field of law, Judge Buller went on to be appointed as Chief Commissioner for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls; the first truly national inquiry. The National Inquiry examined the systemic causes of all forms of violence against indigenous women and girls, including sexual violence. As Chief Commissioner of the organization, Buller played a major role in the writing of Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls; a comprehensive two-volume report which examines the causes for the disturbing statistics of violence against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people in Canada.  National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls  On December 8th, 2015, the Liberal government announced the start of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. The inquiry was set to conclude at the end of 2018. However, Chief Commissioner Buller requested an extension to the inquiry. The final report released on June 3rd, 2019 concluded that the violence faced by indigenous women and girls is caused by state action and inaction. Within the report, Commissioner Buller refers to this ongoing violence as a ‚Äúdeliberate, race, identity and gender- based genocide‚Äù. Among many criticisms of the inquiry was the refusal of the federal government to grant the full two year extension that was requested, which Buller saw as another ‚Äúpart of this national tragedy‚Äù. Awards Besides being appointed the first woman First Nations judge in British Columbia, Marion Buller has accomplished a multitude of great things. In 2012, Buller received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Victoria Faculty of Social Science. In 2016, Maclean's listed her as one of only six people who might be especially influential on policy in the Trudeau government.. Buller has received numerous other awards, including the Queen's Golden Jubilee which recognizes Albertans who demonstrate leadership and talent in performing and visual arts. \\"Queen's Golden Jubilee Awards\\" She also received a Diamond Jubilee Medal which acknowledges Canadian citizens who have greatly contributed to the country and brought great credit to Canada. \\"Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Medal\\" Finally, Marion Buller received the Rosemary Brown Award for Women.

Lenin's November 1920 epigram that \\"Communism is Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country\\" ‚Äî an injunction programmatically advanced by the 1920 GOELRO plan.V.I. Lenin, \\"Our Foreign and Domestic Position and Party Tasks: Speech Delivered To The Moscow Guberniia Conference of the RCP(B), November 21, 1920,\\" Julius Katzer, trans., in Lenin Collected Works: Volume 31. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1965; pp. 408-426. With Soviet electrical engineers and advanced generation equipment in chronically short supply in this period, the Soviet Union turned at once to the hiring of foreign specialists and the importation of machinery produced abroad in an effort to expeditiously overcome the deficit during the years of the first Five Year Plan, launched in 1928. One of the foreign firms contracting with the Soviet government for the installation of electrical equipment and its supervision in production was the British firm Metropolitan- Vickers (Metro-Vick), established by American George Westinghouse in 1899 as British Westinghouse before being jointly purchased by Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company and Vickers Limited two decades later.\\"History of Metropolitan-Vickers Ltd.,\\" www.britishtelephones.com/ The renamed firm had actively pursued engineering contracts outside of Great Britain through its subsidiary, the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Export Company, established in 1919. Other electrical companies supplying vital power generating equipment to the Soviet Union during the 1920s and 1930s included the German corporation Siemens and the American giant firm General Electric.Jonathan Haslam, The Soviet Union and the Struggle for Collective Security in Europe, 1933-39. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1985; pg. 17. On January 7, 1933, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin made a speech on the first Five-Year Plan, but concluded with an ominous warning against counter-revolutionary elements which he claimed were still working to bring about the downfall of the Soviet state: > \\"Thrown out of their groove, and scattered over the whole face of the USSR, > these 'has-beens'The phrase used by Stalin is \\"–±—ã–≤—à–∏–µ –ª—é–¥–∏,\\" literally > \\"former people\\" ‚Äî the members of the urban and rural employing and governing > classes which were overturned, dispossessed, and ostracized following the > Russian Revolution. See: Stalin, Sochineniia (Russian edition), vol. 13, pg. > 207. The official translation has it as \\"have-beens,\\" which is non-idiomatic > English, corrected here. have wormed their way into our plants and > factories, into our government offices and trading organizations, into our > railway and transport enterprises... What did they carry with them into > these places? Of course, they carried with them a feeling of hatred towards > the Soviet regime, a feeling of burning enmity towards the new forms of > economy, life, and culture. \\"These gentlemen are no longer able to launch a > frontal attack against the Soviet regime. They and their classes made such > attacks several times, but they were routed and dispersed. Hence, the only > thing left them is to do mischief and harm to the workers, to the collective > farmers, to the Soviet regime, and to the Party. And they are doing as much > mischief as they can, acting on the sly. They set fire to warehouses and > wreck machinery. They organize sabotage. \\"As a result of fulfilling the five > year plan we have succeeded in finally ejecting the last remnants of the > hostile classes from their positions in production... But that is not > enough. The task is to eject these 'has-beens' from our own enterprises and > institutions and make them harmless for good and all.\\"J.V. Stalin, \\"The > Results of the First Five-Year Plan: Report Delivered on January 7, 1933,\\" > in Works: Volume 13, July 1930-January 1934. Moscow: Foreign Languages > Publishing House, 1955; pp. 211-215. One of the chief parties in the Metro-Vickers affair which would follow was himself clear about a connection between such an official call to vigilance and the events which would follow, declaring in a 1934 memoir that \\"the OGPU were not slow in discovering and revealing the existence of numerous plots\\" in response to Stalin's \\"call for action,\\" thereby \\"proving the words of the 'Dictator.'\\"Allan Monkhouse, Moscow, 1911‚Äì1933. Boston, MA: Little Brown and Co., 1934; pg. 271. =The arrests= On January 25, 1933, the OGPU \\"literally dragged\\" the secretary of six years for Metro-Vickers' Moscow chief, Allan Monkhouse, into a waiting motor car and drove her off to OGPU headquarters at Lubianka Square.Monkhouse, Moscow, pg. 272. Secretary Anna Kutusova returned, \\"exhausted and terrified,\\" to Monkhouse's office at 10 am the next day, her fingers stained with ink from writing.Monkhouse, Moscow, pg. 273. \\"What had occurred, she would not and probably dared not say,\\" Monkhouse later recalled, adding that he felt sure that threats had been used to cause her to henceforth \\"act as an agent of the OGPU\\" and assist in the effort to \\"frame up\\" a case against her employer and his associates.Monkhouse, Moscow, pp. 273-274. With the Soviet secret police clearly investigating the firm, Monkhouse left Moscow for England on February 6, 1933, for a three-week stay.Monkhouse, Moscow, pp. 274-275. The Soviet Union's trade representative in London, who had himself just arrived from Moscow, gave Monkhouse a firm assurance on February 10 that the OGPU investigation of Metro-Vickers had been discussed with the OGPU‚Äôs chiefs and that these high officials knew nothing of any action planned against the British firm. Monkhouse consequently returned to Moscow as planned. At 9:15 pm on March 11, 1933, Metro-Vickers officials L.C. Thornton and Monkhouse were conversing with two guests representing a large engineering firm following a dinner together.Monkhouse, Moscow, pg. 275. Suddenly eight OGPU officers burst into the room, instructing those present to remain seated. Some five hours of close investigation followed, headed by the deputy chief of the Economic Department of the OGPU, who presented Monkhouse with search and arrest warrants.Monkhouse, Moscow, pp. 275-276. Monkhouse later estimated that between 50 and 80 select OGPU officials were involved in the carefully planned raid.Monkhouse, Moscow, pg. 276. Monkhouse was allowed to take a bath before being taken away to GPU headquarters at the Lubianka, where he was kept in a comparatively comfortable single isolation cell.Monkhouse, Moscow, pg. 281. After a difficult night, Monkhouse was taken to the examination department and interrogated. Monkhouse asserted that no physical torture, hypnotism, or drugs were used on him but that the interrogation was conducted for many hours on end, running without interruption from breakfast time until 2 am. Monkhouse denied repeatedly that he was a British intelligence agent but later asserted that he had been overcome by exhaustion towards the end of the process and consented to write a statement. Monkhouse later recalled: > \\"Towards late evening I began to get very tired.... Almost every phrase > which [the interrogator] dictated I disputed, altered, and finally wrote in > a form which I thought would satisfy him and yet not harm my employers‚Äô high > reputation. After midnight I felt that my nerve was going. I was dead tired > after the previous night‚Äôs search and arrest, and a very long day‚Äôs > intensive examination. I felt my tongue and mouth so dry that they gave me > considerable discomfort. My lips twitched in a way they had never done > before. It was a hard mental effort to resist writing exactly what [the > interrogator] dictated and, in any case, before I left the room that night, > I wrote one or two paragraphs which I greatly regret having consented to > write. I can only attribute my weakness in having done so to the exhausted > nervous and mental condition to which I had been reduced after a very long > day‚Äôs examination by the OGPU, following a sleepless night.\\"Monkhouse, > Moscow, pp. 282-283. Monkhouse expressed a belief that the basic method of operation of the OGPU was to \\"trick\\" those being detained into signing written statements which could later be used against them at trial.Monkhouse, Moscow, pg. 296. After a second lengthy day of interrogation the interview was abruptly cut short and Monkhouse was released under orders not to leave the city, apparently at the behest of OGPU chief Vyacheslav Menzhinsky.Monkhouse, Moscow, pg. 286. The Soviet secret police proved to be far from finished with Monkhouse or Metro- Vickers, however. On March 13, 1933, an official statement of the OGPU was published in the pages of Izvestiia, the official government newspaper, which stated: > \\"An investigation by the OGPU into a series of sudden and regularly > recurring breakdowns which have lately occurred in big power stations > (Moscow, Cheliabinsk, Zuevka, Zlatoust) has revealed that the breakdowns > were the result of wrecking activity on the part of a group of criminal > elements among state employees under the People‚Äôs Commissariat of Heavy > Industry, who made it their object to destroy the power stations of the USSR > (acts of diversion) and put out of commission the State factories served by > these power stations. In the work of this wrecking group there actively > participated certain employees of the British firm, Metropolitan- > Vickers...\\"The Case of N.P. Vitvitsky, [et al.], Charged with Wrecking > Activities at Power Stations in the Soviet Union: Heard Before the Special > Session of the Supreme Court of the USSR in Moscow, April 12‚Äì19, 1933: > Translation of the Official Verbatim Report. In Three Volumes. Moscow: State > Law Publishing House, 1933; volume 1, pp. 11-12. Hereafter: Translation of > the Official Verbatim Report. =The trial= The decision to proceed to a formal public trial relating to the British employees of Metro-Vickers was made by the Central Executive Committee on March 30, 1933.Translation of the Official Verbatim Report, vol. 1, pg. 4. The week-long trial commenced on April 12. According to the formal indictment read at the start of the trial, the defendants were part of a \\"wrecking group\\" which sought to damage state equipment \\"with the object of undermining the power of Soviet industry and weakening the Soviet state,\\" as well as participating in the gathering of intelligence about the defense capabilities of the USSR.Translation of the Official Verbatim Report, vol. 1, pg. 12. It was asserted that bribery and corruption of \\"certain employees of state power stations\\" had been carried out in connection with this secret mission. The indictment noted that a panel of 6 \\"expert engineers\\" had studied the matter in association with the office of the Procurator of the RSFSR and had concluded that in all the cases of breakdowns investigated there was either criminal negligence or deliberate wrecking on the part of a number of persons in the technical personnel serving these stations.\\"Translation of the Official Verbatim Report, vol. 1, pp. 12-13. As for the charges of espionage, the prosecution cited the pre-trial interrogation transcripts of V.A. Gussev, head of the Zlatoust Power Station from 1929, who admitted collecting military-related information as well as that of W.L. MacDonald, who in his own statement acknowledged telling Gussev that he \\"required information about the production of military supplies at the Zlatoust works, the state of power supply, etc.\\"Translation of the Official Verbatim Report, vol. 1, pp. 16-17. Emphasis in original. MacDonald's interrogation transcript, introduced as part of the indictment, additionally indicated that the instruction to collect such material on \\"the political and economic situation of the USSR\\" had come in the summer of 1929 from his boss, L.C. Thornton.Translation of the Official Verbatim Report, vol. 1, pp. 16-17. In his damning pre-trial interrogation transcript, MacDonald also admitted attempting to sabotage military production at an attached metallurgical works by undermining electrical production at the Zlatoust power station and to have paid Gussev 2,000 or 2,500 rubles for his assistance.Translation of the Official Verbatim Report, vol. 1, pp. 32-34. Soviet authorities were anxious to counter anticipated objections that the pre-trial statements by Gussev and MacDonald had been obtained under duress, with procurator Andrey Vyshinsky publishing an interview on the politically sensitive prospective case in Izvestiia on March 23 asserting that \\"no kind of pressure was brought to bear on the accused\\" and that \\"only enemies who are striving to impair our relations with other states would spread such absurd rumors about alleged deviations from the established rules of procedure...\\"Izvestiia, March 23, 1933, quoted in Cummings, The Moscow Trial, pp. 44-45. =Outcome= No death sentences were handed out as a result of the April 1933 Metro-Vickers trial, with two of those indicted to stand trial not receiving punishment of any kind.J. Arch Getty and Oleg V. Naumov, The Road to Terror: Stalin and the Self-Destruction of the Bolsheviks, 1932‚Äì1939. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1999; pg. 113. In the view of the most recent study of the affair, by Nipissing University history professor Gordon W. Morrell, this comparatively mild sentence may have resulted from indecision within the Soviet government as to the severity of the alleged wrecking activity and the efficacy of draconian punishment in a case so closely impacting Soviet-British relations.Gordon W. Morrell, Britain Confronts the Stalin Revolution: Anglo-Soviet Relations and the Metro-Vickers Crisis. Waterloo, ON: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1995; pg. 150. Cited in Getty and Naumov, The Road to Terror, pg. 113. =Legacy= Contemporary historians of the Soviet Union regard the Metro-Vickers Affair as one of a series of show trials conducted by the All-Union Communist Party against engineers and technicians trained under the old regime ‚Äî proceedings which included the 1928 Shakhty Trial and the so-called Industrial Party Trial of 1930. All of these public spectacles seem to have been intended to send a political message, it is argued, that \\"older technical specialists from the old regime were not to be trusted and that [Communist] party members and Soviet citizens must be increasingly vigilant against enemies.\\" Footnotes Further reading * A.J.

Due to its long history and complicated political divisions, various names have been used to refer to the region and its subsections. The modern English name Bengal is an exonym derived from the Bengal Sultanate period. The name is used by both Bangladesh and West Bengal in international contexts. In the Bengali language, the two Bengals each use a different term to refer to the nominally identified nation: BƒÅnglƒÅ () and Ba·πÖga () Terminology in detail *Geography: **Bengal is a region in Asia located in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent at the apex of the Bay of Bengal. Geographically it is part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta system, the largest river delta system in the world. The region borders the Himalayan states to its north and in the east borders Northeast India and the country of Burma. **Bangla () may be a transliteration of either Bengal (a geographical and ethno-linguistic region in South Asia) or Bengali (an adjective referring to something of, from, or related to Bengal). It can also refer to the endonym of the region in the Bengali language or the native name of the region. **Banga () is a transliteration of the Bengali name of the region of Bengal as a geographical and ethno-linguistic region in South Asia. *Language: **Bangladesh (; Bengali Country) was a popular term for the region as a unified country during the Bengali Renaissance (), and was used in Bengali patriotic songs and poems like \\"Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo\\" (1932) by Kazi Nazrul Islam, who later became the national poet of Bangladesh.https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome- instant&ion;=1&espv;=2&ie;=UTF-8#q=nomo+nomo+nomo+bangladesh+momo&start;=0 In his patriotic song Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy (1905), the poet Rabindranath Tagore used the word Bangladesh to refer to his motherland.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/How-is-Bangladesh- reacting-to-West-Bengals-name-change-proposal/articleshow/53558947.cms Alternatives to the name Bangladesh are: ***Bangadesh (; lit. Bengali Country) ***Bangabhumi or Banglabhumi (; lit. Bengali Land) ***Bangarajya or Banglarajya (; lit. Bengali Realm) ***Bangarashtra or Banglarashtra (; lit. Bengali State) *Politics: **East Bengal ‚Äì The 1947 Partition of Bengal divided the British Indian province of Bengal as part of the formal Partition of India. East Bengal (now Bangladesh), which was predominantly Muslim, became a province of Pakistan. In 1955, East Bengal became the new province of East Pakistan. In 1971, East Pakistan declared Independence during the Liberation War of Bangladesh and the new nation of Bangladesh was formed. **West Bengal ‚Äì The Partition of Bengal also created West Bengal, a predominantly Hindu province of India. In 2011, the Government of West Bengal proposed a change in the official name of the state to Paschimbongo ( P√¥shchimb√¥ngg√¥). This is the native name of the state, literally meaning \\"West Bengal\\" in the Bengali language. In 2016, West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed a resolution to change the name of West Bengal to Bengal in English, Bangla in Bengali and Bangal in Hindi. Despite the Trinamool Congress government's efforts to forge a consensus, the Congress, the Left Front, and the Bharatiya Janata Party opposed the resolution and it awaits the consent of the Indian Parliament for approval. **Bangabhumi or Bir Banga ‚Äì A separatist movement to create a Hindu country in southwestern Bangladesh, envisioned by Banga Sena. **Greater Bangladesh ‚Äì A political theory circulated by a number of politicians, intellectuals and writers that the People's Republic of Bangladesh has aspirations to unite Bengali-speaking regions into a greater historical Bengal. According to the theory this would include the Indian states of West Bengal, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam, Andaman Islands, and the Rakhine State (formerly Arakan/Rohang) in Myanmar (formerly Burma) as part of its own territory with democratic governance.Venkata Siddharthacharry, Jambudwipa, a blueprint for a South Asian community, page 256, Radiant Publishers, 1985, **United Bengal ‚Äì A proposal that was put forward by Bengali political leaders Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and Sarat Chandra Bose to found a united and independent nation-state of Bengal. The proposal was floated as an alternative to the Partition of Bengal on communal lines. Geographical distinctions =East Bengal= East Bengal ( Purb√¥ Bangla) was the name used during two different periods in the 20th century for a territory that roughly corresponded to the modern state of Bangladesh. Both instances involved a violent partition of Bengal which made one half East Bengal or Bangladesh. Historically, it referred to the fertile Bhati region of the Bengal delta, which corresponds to the modern-day Dhaka Division. =North Bengal= North Bengal () is a term used for the north- western part of Bangladesh and northern part of West Bengal. The Bangladesh part includes the Rajshahi Division and Rangpur Division. Generally, it is the area lying west of Jamuna River and north of Padma River and includes the Barind Tract. The West Bengal part denotes the Jalpaiguri Division (Alipurduar, Cooch Behar, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, North Dinajpur, South Dinajpur and Malda). The Bihar parts include the Kishanganj district. It also includes parts of Darjeeling Hills.

The work was commissioned by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, for which Lindberg is composer-in-residence, and co-commissioned by The Proms, the Helsinki Festival, and the Casa da M√∫sica. It was first performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Vladimir Jurowski in the Royal Albert Hall, London, on July 24, 2016. Composition =Background= Lindberg composed Two Episodes as both a standalone piece and as concert opener for Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, for which it was first commissioned. Before the world premiere, Lindberg reflected, \\"If I was really pressed to choose just one composer from the classical canon it would have to be Beethoven, because he stands out as an example of what it is to be a contemporary composer ‚Äì just as much as figures like Xenakis in my own lifetime. I've re-examined his late works with fresh ears in preparing for this composition, to create music that leads naturally to the amazing opening of the Ninth Symphony but which can also have an independent life of its own.\\" Though Two Episodes does not directly quote the Ninth Symphony, the work is peppered with references to Beethoven's music. Lindberg remarked, \\"For obvious reasons I've kept well away from all references to Beethoven's finale which has to leap out on its own terms.\\" He continued, \\"Rather than quotations, I've embedded a number of Beethovenian allusions, so there are clear aural links, and the orchestration matches the symphony, so it will have a period colour without harp, piano and exotic percussion that feature in many of my works. The harmonic world will naturally be much later than Beethoven's, though it is the outcome of where he was heading.\\" =Structure= Two Episodes has a duration of roughly 15 minutes and is cast in two connected movements. The first movement alludes to the opening movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The second movement similarly references the third, slow movement of the Beethoven's Ninth and ends on the A and E perfect fifth that opens the symphony. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for an orchestra comprising two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, cor anglais, three clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, timpani, three percussionists, and strings. Reception Two Episodes has received a mixed response from music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Richard Fairman of the Financial Times wrote, \\"At about 15 minutes, the work offers a luminescent short journey through terrain familiar from Ravel and Respighi, like a widescreen travelogue filmed with saturated colours through a high-performance lens. The LPO made a virtuoso job of it, though any relevance to Beethoven remained unclear.\\" Erica Jeal of The Guardian also praised the piece, opining, \\"It's the iconic first gesture of the symphony ‚Äì that falling figure tracing the sparest possible harmony ‚Äì that is a recurring motif in Lindberg's score, glimpsed through whirling violins at the opening, and cutting through the almost Mahlerian textures several times thereafter. Future performances might find Two Episodes standing on its own, without the symphony; but while those audiences might not get to hear the Beethoven, they will certainly think of it.\\" Ivan Hewett of The Daily Telegraph was more critical of the music, however, writing, \\"On paper, his idea of taking key phrases from Beethoven's piece, such as the thrilling opening with its sense of huge beckoning spaces, and leading them into his own richly coloured, swirling orchestral world seemed promising. Certainly one could spot Beethoven's ideas, whirling past like pieces of flotsam on the surging orchestral tide.\\" He continued, \\"As always, Lindberg's turbo-charged musical machine invited us to sit back and enjoy the ride, but this time it was just too obvious the machine was running on empty. The sumptuous water-fall of Debussyan harmonies seemed entirely devoid of ideas (apart from Beethoven's, that is). Richard Strauss once said he 'wanted to compose as the cow gives milk'. Lindberg could now say the same, except that in his case the milk is curdled.\\" David Nice of The Arts Desk was similarly critical of the piece, remarking: References Compositions by Magnus Lindberg 2016 compositions Compositions for symphony orchestra Ludwig van Beethoven Music commissioned by the London Philharmonic Orchestra Music commissioned by the BBC Music commissioned by the Helsinki Festival ","title":"Two Episodes"},{"id":"51303006","text":"Peter William Bodde (born October 1954) is a member of the United States Foreign Service, and was the 8th United States Ambassador to Libya.

The film had its world premiere on August 31, 2015 at Film4 FrightFest and stars Danni Smith and Tim Lueke as two activists that investigate a series of disappearing shower curtains in Smith's apartment. Plot Danni has recently left her job as a hospice nurse in order to become an activist for Whale Savers, a whale conservation group. She also leaves the home of her uncle, Gus, moving into a recently vacated apartment in order to get a new start on life. However soon after she gets settled she discovers that her shower curtains have been disappearing. Danni decides to try to record her bathroom overnight in order to discover what is going on, only to find that her shower curtains are disappearing into a strange portal in her shower wall. She later brings this up with one of her fellow activists, Tim, who eagerly suggests that she put her contact information on a curtain. This way, if someone finds the curtain the person can call Danni and they can discover the portal's destination. They are contacted by Willy, a drifter that tells them that her curtain appeared in a wooded creek near Poughkeepsie, New York. He volunteers to take them to the area he discovered the curtain, but shortly after arriving he begins huffing paint, bringing out a hostile alter ego named Frankie, and attacking the two activists. They manage to escape the area, but as soon as they arrive back to Danni's apartment they are confronted by the Pale Man, who tells Danni that she is bound to the portal and brand her hand with a symbol. She is also cautioned about putting up another curtain. Ignoring the Pale Man, Danni pulls down the tiles on her shower wall and discovers a strange map. She also puts up a curtain and records its disappearance, noting that certain parts of the map glow. Her investigations are not without repercussions and Danni discovers her uncle dead in his home with the same symbol on her hand branded into his forehead. Through her own investigations and some notes made by her uncle, Danni realizes that the glowing sections of the map mark a specific location near the creek and has Tim put up curtains so she can see where it appears. While she is searching the area Danni discovers one of her shower curtains with a monster inside of it, which chases her until the Pale Man appears with several yokels that routinely monitor the portal in order to kill any monsters that come through. They then make her bury the monsters that have come through the curtains as a result of her experimenting with the shower. They're about to murder her when a new monster appears, giving Danni an opening to escape as the monster kills the Pale Man and his helpers. When the monster turns to Danni, she beats it to death and escapes to her apartment. When she returns to her apartment she realizes that the monster was actually Tim, who had discovered her distress and went through the portal with the curtain in order to rescue her. Distraught, Danni takes a shower curtain and transforms herself into one of the monsters. A tabloid is later shown, revealing that a monster implied to be Danni killed the entire crew of the whaler ship Obake Maru, the ship the two had been sidewalk protesting against.

Potato Parcel (or PotatoParcel.com) is an American company and website for delivering potatoes with personalized messages, which are limited to 140 characters or one picture. History In May 2015, Potato Parcel was founded by mobile app developer Alex Craig, a 24-year-old University of North Texas alum, and was later promoted on Reddit. Originally, Potato Parcel was based in Dallas, Texas. Craig said he would buy the potatoes from the local neighborhood Walmart. Reportedly, profits per month ranged between $10,000 and $13,000. Potato Parcel proved popular on websites like Twitter. In an email interview with MarketWatchs Kathleen Burke, Craig said \\"I wanted to create a brand new way of sending a message outside of apps and technology by allowing anyone to send an anonymous message‚Ä¶on a potato.\\" In October 2015, Potato Parcel was sold to Bay Area entrepreneur Riad Bekhit for $40,000 and moved to San Bruno, California. Bekhit says he uses a Pilot G2 gel roller pens to write messages. Since the move, new products include Lump of Coal Potato (a potato that is spray-painted black), Potato Pal (a potato with a picture of someone's face), Potato Postcard (a postcard pasted onto a potato), and Spooky Tater (a potato painted to look like a pumpkin). A burlap sack is also available for shipping. In April 2016, Bekhit said profits per month ranged between $20,000 and $25,000. Potato Parcel has expanded shipping to Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United Kingdom. Potato Parcel also inspired a number of other delivery companies. Another company of the same name based in Australia delivers at the cost of $10 and a message of 15 words or less. Potato Parcel also inspired Brick or Potato, which allows the customer to choose between a brick or potato with a personalized message at the cost of ¬£6.99. Potato Messenger, started by two art students Will Richards and Daniel Butson, mailed 1,000 potatoes to Parliament House, Canberra painted and arranged as the rainbow flag to protest for marriage equality in Australia. It also inspired Bananas Gone Wild, founded by electrocardiogram technician Davonte Wilson of Plano, Texas, and Nannergram, founded by Konnor Willison and based in Lehi, Utah, which delivers bananas with personalized messages.

AllMusic's James Christopher Monger claimed that it \\"delivers on its promise of \\"The Sword: Unplugged,\\" emitting its own curious current of intimacy, leaving the listener both transfixed and uneasy\\". Monger highlighted tracks such as \\"Empty Temples\\" and \\"Mist & Shadow\\", but criticised \\"Seriously Mysterious\\" and \\"Ghost Eye\\" for feeling \\"a bit weightless\\". Jeremy Ulrey for Metal Injection criticised many songs on the album in a track-by- track review, claiming that the album \\"mostly reaffirms that only about half of these songs bear any real heft to them at all\\", although he did praise the renditions of \\"Mist & Shadow\\", \\"Seriously Mysterious\\" and \\"Early Snow\\". Michael Toland of The Austin Chronicle hailed the album for presenting \\"genuine creative advancement\\", in particular claiming that the acoustic format suited frontman John D. Cronise's vocals more than the band's regular style.

Plot Introduction  Set in a small Indian town in 1995 where Rajesh Deshpande, an insecure, isolated science teacher is smitten by the new English tutor, but struggles to find a way to meet her. Then he learns about the forthcoming solar eclipse which appears to provide the ideal opportunity to impress her. Meanwhile, his faithful but superstitious wife Sumila determines to restore his love for her with the help of the Hindu gods and under the counsel of her overbearing mother. Reception Mary Loudon writing in The Times states that despite never having been to India, the author \\"has managed with exquisite sensitivity to capture the feel and the tone of the country.\\" Loudon does criticize the novels 'lack of pace and colour', explaining that \\"To set up a debate about science versus religion in contemporary India is a great idea, but the execution of it is a little slow and a little dry, and to my mind the novel is too long.\\" But she concludes \\"Nevertheless, Whitaker is a thoughtful and imaginative writer, who bends to his subject and characters with rare humility and commitment. He is yet to find a confident authorial voice and a strong identifying style, but with time he may well do so\\".\\"Having stars in his eyes\\", Books, The Times, 30 Aug 1997 James Simmons in The Spectator has no such reservations and calls the novel 'a little masterpiece', writing \\"Because of its familiar subject and the naivet√© of the characters one might be inclined to put this book aside after the first chapter, but it is well worth persevering with because Whitaker is so genuinely inventive. The characters are always surprising you and contributing something subtle and interesting to the theme. Perhaps economy is the key to Whitaker's brilliance. Nothing is overdone.\\"Once in a blue moon ¬ª 3 Oct 1997 ¬ª The Spectator Archive Retrieved 2016-08-10. Trevor Lewis in The Sunday Times is also positive, \\"It is a pleasant surprise to find an English writer who deftly evokes both the peculiar flavours of modern Indian life and the rhythms of subcontinental literature as a whole. Whitaker's novel plays off the themes of rationalism and spirituality, sculpting them into a leisurely comedy\\" and concludes \\"A generously humoured, genuinely humane account of infatuation and heartbreak\\".Sunday Times, (July 12, 1998): News: p10.

Among its different forms, it would have removed obstacles to employers making collective agreements, established an impartial National Public Employment Relations Commission to support fair collective bargaining, required that pensions plans are jointly managed by employee and employer representatives, changed the definition of an \\"employee\\" to ensure every person who works for other people has labor rights, repeal all \\"right to work\\" laws. The latest version of the Act in 2018 gathered endorsements from leading lawmakers in the Democratic Party, including Kirsten Gillibrand and Mark Pocan. Background Given the long term decline in collective bargaining and the rise in inequality, a substantial number of employee representatives, Democratic politicians, labor unions, academics, judges and lawyers had been advocating the revision of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. On 25 September 1992 Bernie Sanders introduced the Bill to the US House of Representatives with 2 cosponsors.HR 6041 (102nd), Charles Hayes [D-IL1] and Major Owens [D-NY12] After the Bill failed, Sanders tried again in 1994, with one cosponsor.H.R. 5126 (103rd) with Major Owens [D-NY12] On a third attempt in 1995 by Sanders, the Bill gathered 19 cosponsors.H.R. 1355 (104th) David Bonior [D-MI10] (joined Nov 13, 1995), Peter DeFazio [D-OR4], Lane Evans [D-IL17], Chaka Fattah [D-PA2], Bob Filner [D-CA50], Henry Gonz√°lez [D-TX20], Luis Guti√©rrez [D-IL4], William Lipinski [D-IL3] (joined Nov 13, 1995), Zoe Lofgren [D-CA16], Matthew Mart√≠nez [D-CA31], Jerrold Nadler [D-NY8], Eleanor Norton [D-DC0], Major Owens [D-NY11], Donald Payne [D-NJ10] , Esteban Torres [D-CA34], Nydia Vel√°zquez [D-NY12], Melvin Watt [D-NC12] , Lynn Woolsey [D-CA6], Marcy Kaptur [D-OH9] (joined Apr 15, 1996) Still the Bill stalled. It was reintroduced in 1997.HR 1355 (104th)HR 2012 of 1997 (105th) On 24 March 1999, it was introduced again and referred to the Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations on 30 April 1999.H.R. 1277 (106th) It stalled by 20 December 2000.

This gained 47 co-sponsors. It was reintroduced in 2002, H.R. 5529 (107th) and 2003, H.R. 323 (108th). In 2015, a new version of the Workplace Democracy Act was introduced by both Bernie Sanders in the Senate and Mark Pocan in the House, receiving multiple sponsors but not passing as the Republican Party held majorities.S 2142 (114th) In 2018, an extended version of the 2015 Bill was proposed by Bernie Sanders.

The Scottish New Town‚Äôs name derives from the Gaelic for \\"the meeting of the waters\\" and there is broad agreement that one of these waters is the Red Burn. Source and course of the river The Red Burn's headwater begins as a rivulet on the west side of Fannyside Lochs known as the Glencryan Burn. West Fannyside Loch Glencryan ReservoirIt flows west through Palacerigg Golf Course and becomes a significant geographic feature when it produces the Glencryan Reservoir south of Forest Road in Cumbernauld. The name of the stream from its source until it enters the Vault Glen is the Glencryan Burn. It enters Cumbernauld behind Cumbernauld Academy (formerly Cumbernauld High). The river then runs under Forest Road and its name changes to The Red Burn on the other side. The river takes a sudden turn to the east and is joined by a few nameless rivulets which come down from both the steep sided banks, the left bank being Kildrum and the right hand being Abronhill. The Scottish Wildlife Trust owns the land around the river at this point with the exception of a sewage pipeline which runs through the Vault Glen. The Vault Glen has very steep sides with the stream some 25-30m below the brow of the hill and any rubbish dropped is difficult to remove although there have been some attempts to clean it up. The Red Burn crosses the railway under a large viaduct before its confluence with the Bog Stank just down river from the bridge over the path from the Park above. View from the Bridge over the Red Burn in the Vault Glen. A few metres downstream it meets the Bog Stank18th Century Bridge at CastlecaryAfter the confluence the Red Burn passes the dovecote and Broom Road, Abronhill before flowing back under the Forest Road Bridge heading towards Dunns Wood. From there the river passes through a sewage works. Work costing ¬£3.8 million was completed on upgrading the water treatment system in 2013. Its purpose is to clean water from the Wardpark Estate before it joins the river. Scottish Water made a system of ponds which are designed to have the same effect as larger natural system. They contain the water then filter them and release the purified water slowly. The system called Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SUDS), prevents flooding by absorbing water from short-term storm flashes and releases it over a longer period of time. Theoretically pollutants are extracted and cleaner water is subsequently released back into the river. Because of the catchment area's size six ponds were required. Beside the ponds, the ¬£10.5million project constructed a ¬£10.5 million pound extra treatment process. This provides a higher standard of waste water treatment, and should allow for expansion due to population growth. In 2018 Scottish Water was fined ¬£17k for a discharge of raw sewage into the Red Burn in 2014. Forth and Clyde canal passing over the Red Burn on aqueduct Red Burn passing under Forth and Clyde Canal The only significant subsequent tributary of the Red Burn is the Walton Burn which flows round the east side of Abronhill. The river forms the border between Falkirk and North Lanarkshire councils at this point. The Red Burn then flows under the M80, the B816 and the 18th century Castlecary Viaduct carrying the railway track. This is close to the historic Castle Cary Castle. After the Red Burn has crossed the road and the railway it is then crossed by the Forth and Clyde Canal on an aqueduct close to Bonny Water.http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/record/nls/24816/ordnance-survey-six- inch-mile-dunbartonshire-sheet-n-xxixse/OS6Inch2nd?inline=true#map-wrapper Zoom on right hand map for canal crossings The Red Burn's confluence with the smaller Bonny Water occurs just north of the canal and the river is now called the Bonny Water until it reaches the River Carron downstream. The Carron itself enters the Firth of Forth at Grangemouth. Competing Theories for Cumbernauld's Name Pont's Map of the area around Cummernad Wood New ParckBlaeu's map from 1654 based on Pont's original c.1596 \\"The East Central Lowlands (Stirling, Falkirk & Kilsyth) - Pont 32\\" map depicting Cumbernad Ca≈øt., Dulettyr, W. Wood, Ca≈øtel Cary, Ridburn and the mysterious Hor≈øeward B. Cumbernauld is the largest town in North Lanarkshire. Some people think the name Cumbernauld's Gaelic name http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5270/1/2014DrummondPhD.pdf#233 Peter Drummond PhD 2004 pg 233 Comar nan Allt meaning \\"the confluence of the waters\\" refers to the meeting of the Red Burn with the Bog Stank stream. This occurs in the Vault Glen down the hill but very close to the site of the Comyn‚Äôs Castle. In support of this argument the oldest maps of Cumbernauld still in existence show the ‚ÄúRid Burn‚Äù joining three other streams. On the map they all seem to come together at one point although this bears little relation to the current watercourses. Probably the earliest map which shows the river is the 1596 Pont's Map but is much easier to pick out on Blaeu's coloured map which was derived from it. Another stream named as the Horseward Burn is mentioned and is shown to join with the Red Burn. What this refers to is not at all clear. These older maps are reminiscent of the modern Friends of the Glen map which is also a stylised representation of the Park.Stylised map from Friends Of Cumbernauld Glen Map including Vault Glen Pont's map does mention the Luggie but doesn't seem to associate this with Cumbernauld or its castle. In fact the Luggie is a considerable distance from Cumbernauld Village. The name Condorrat, formerly a separate village but now part of the town, has a Gaelic origin too: \\"Comh Dobhair Alt\\" - The joint river place.http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5270/1/2014DrummondPhD.pdf#229 For historical pronunciations This name may be close in meaning to Cumbernauld's. Andy Scott Arria Cumbernauld with a poem \\"Watershed\\" incribed on its base. The other competing theory is that the etymology of the name is to do with Cumbernauld being a Scottish watershed. In that case the waters referred to are the Red Burn and the Luggie Water even though they do not in fact meet. In other words from its high point in the Central Belt, The Luggie Water and the Red Burn flow either west to the River Clyde or east to the Firth of Forth so Cumbernauld is a watershed. Jim Carruth, poet laureate of Glasgow, has a poem called Watershed which is inscribed on the base of Andy Scott's Arria, The Angel of the 'Naud, statue which overlooks the A80 in Cumbernauld. This presupposes the etymology of the name is about Cumbernauld being a watershed. Hugo Millar, the respected local historian and author of two books about the town, espoused this view. Peter Drummond gives an analysis of both viewpoints from historical and geographical perspectives. What can be said with confidence is that Cumbernauld is named after the Red Burn. Influence on Local Placenames Three streets in Cumbernauld are named after the Red Burn and also use the older form of the name where Redburn is just one word. These are in the Abronhill part of the town. Similarly Redburn School takes its name from the stream. Roman History The Antonine Wall named after the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius, crosses the Red Burn at Castlecary and Roman remains have been found on both sides of the river. The wall, built by Urbicus's men is named on the Unesco World Heritage list as a Frontier for the Roman Empire. However the land has been considerably worked for the Forth and Clyde Canal, the Glasgow to Edinburgh railway and the A80 now M80 road system. Older maps show how the fort of Castle Cary was to the east of the river, as was the later Castle Cary Castle. There is also the site of a Roman camp to the west of the river near the modern Castlecary Hotel. There is a gruesome story about how the Red Burn (sometimes called the Rid Burn or Redburn) was named. It involves the killing of Agricola's Roman soldiers whose bodies were dumped in the river at Castlecary making it run red. Other Cumbernauldian Watercourses Contrary to Jon Ronson's insulting comments endorsed by Craig Ferguson on C.B.S.'s Late, Late Show, Cumbernauld does have at least two rivers: the Red Burn and the Luggie Water. There is also the Moss Water which was dammed to form Broadwood Loch.

The targeted cells can process the Œ±- chain peptides to form triple helix collagen, and replenish the collagen in the targeted site. Scientists believe that Alpha collagen can help to deliver specific ratios of peptides to benefit the targeted cells. Alpha collagen is designed to be used as a supplement for osteoarthritis, based on the theory of the different environments of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM of joint cartilage comprises many classes of macromolecules; collagen (type I, II, VI, X collagen fibrils) and proteoglycans. The ratio and the proportion of collagen play an important role in the tensile and compressive strength, as well as the elasticity of the tissue. The content of collagen in cartilage is different between joints and soft tissue structures. For example, cartilage in the knee has a different structure to the ankle. Cartilage, skin, and spinal discs are subject to continuous regeneration during which anabolic and catabolic processes are in equilibrium. Any imbalance in this equilibrium between matrix degeneration and regeneration results in a decrease in the components of the ECM, and leads to loss of chondral damage. Therefore, it is important to tackle the degenerative process before the inflammatory metalloproteases set in by replenishing the collagen in the ECM. Collagen supplementation has been shown in research studies (in vitro and in vivo) to increase the thickness or volume of the cartilage tissue. Collagen can stimulate chondrocytes, which are responsible for the metabolic maintenance of the ECM.

It is a round-trip hike from the trailhead, just off of the Foss River Road. The lake is located at the eastern base of Camp Robber Peak in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area, within King County, Washington. Reaching Big Heart Lake requires a significant elevation gain of over 3,000 feet from the trailhead, and the lake itself has a surface elevation of 4,418 feet.  Ecology  Big Heart Lake demonstrates many of the typical attributes of higher elevation lakes. These lakes often have high productivity rates during the summer but over the entire year are relatively unproductive.http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00939/wdfw00939.pdf This results in widely varying fish populations across the alpine lakes in Washington. However, a common trait of alpine trout is possessing a head disproportionately large in comparison to the body. When this trait is observed it is a direct reflection of low productivity in the lake, as the fish is not able to find enough food to support body growth or size equivalent to that of its head. Big Heart itself has been stocked with fish at least three times in its history. Each time, once in 2001, 2005, and 2009, about 15,000 fish consisting of a mix of rainbow and cutthroat trout were deposited in the lake. During the summer, this lake experiences a may fly hatch most days.  Popularity  Big Heart Lake along with the other Foss Lakes has long been one of the most popular hikes or backpacking trips in the Cascades. The area is well known for its multitude of gorgeous lakes and options accessible while on a trip to Big Heart Lake. A NorthWest Forest pass is required to park at the trail head and a self issued Alpine Lakes Wilderness permit is also required.

The band was formed in 2009 by Edward Krimm (lead vocals, piano, keyboards) and Jaagup Tormis (drums, percussion, vocals), the grandson of one of the greatest living choral composers Veljo Tormis. The current lineup consists of Edward Krimm, Jaagup Tormis, Kaur Gar≈°nek (guitar) and Valdur Viiklepp (bass guitar, vocals). All the members have a musical background and have taken part in other musical groups as well. Most notably, Jaagup Tormis has played in Sinine and Pedigree, Kaur Gar≈°nek (a son of Igor Gar≈°nek, a keyboardist of one of the foremost Estonian rock group Ruja) has played in Kreatiivmootor. Past members of The Princes have included Taavi Paomets, Kostja Ts√µbulevski and Madis Viksi.  Musical style and media coverage of the debut album  The Princes' debut album \\"Stars\\" was released digitally as well as in CD format towards the end of 2015. According to the progressive rock music portal Progarchives.com, The Princes, being a crossover prog-rock band, \\"draws inspiration from a multitude of sources and styles, from cabaret, opera and folk music, on one hand, to blues, hard rock and progressive rock, on the other, while the vocals draw inspiration from romantic era choir music\\". A major Estonian media outlet, Eesti P√§evaleht, described the band's overall style as being very similar to Queen and found the album to be a \\"strong release\\". Estonian Public Broadcasting review also made also the Queen reference and added influences like The Beatles, Pantera, Muse, Stravinsky, Metallica and Farinelli, but deemed the end result as being too eclectic, perplexing and incoherent. Estonian main culture newspaper Sirp reviewed the album and compared the music to Queen, Pink Floyd and Dream Theater, compared Edward Krimm's vocal performances to Freddie Mercury's, and found the album to be a multi-faceted whole, incorporating powerful rock sound, complicated progressive rock structures and \\"deconstructed boogie\\", but made a critical comment about the overall sound lacking low end support and high end brilliance. UK indie music portal Forkster reviewed the album and subsequently nominated The Princes for \\"Band of The Day\\", compared it to King Crimson, Dream Theater, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Genesis, Yes, and yet, Queen. Forkster: \\"An avant-garde band that is as effective in whole music diversity as any rock band out there today, 'magnificent rock definition' /.../ Masterpiece music exhibitions of rocketing guitar riff mastery, vivid vocal storm phenoms, spectacular piano key shines alongside 'stunning and running' boom rhythm superbs entirely. It has a sensational volume, character and vibe that 'thrills and chills' with diverse genre act inclusions of classic rock splendour, heavy metal/hard rock thunder, psychedelic rock trips, hip jazz rides and progressive rock dominance foundations.\\"  Live performances and supporting Queen  The Princes warming up the crowd for Queen concert in Tallinn The Princes has shared the stage with bands like Vennaskond from Estonia and Von Hertzen Brothers and Dingo from Finland. They have also shared the stage with artists like Lubomyr Melnyk, Jimi Tenor, Vaiko Eplik and Ultima Thule. The Princes has performed at Tallinn Music Week, one of the biggest Baltic showcase festivals, in 2014 as well as in 2016 and in the latter case was declared Tallinn Music Week's \\"Artist of The Day\\" by an Estonian media outlet Postimees. So far, the band's biggest stage performance has been supporting the legendary rock band Queen on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. On the 5th of June, 2016, The Princes performed as one of the only two warm-up bands for Queen and Adam Lambert concert at Tallinn Song Festival Grounds, Tallinn, Estonia, the other warm-up group being Electric Pyramid from UK. This was the only Queen concert in the Baltic region, the first Queen concert in Estonia, and was attended by tens of thousands of people. Following the event, Eesti P√§evaleht described The Princes' approach as \\"theatrical indie-prog, conceptually not dissimilar to Queen\\". Internet music magazine Reflections of Darkness covered the concert as well and said The Princes to be \\"The most promising new band from Estonia /.../ [and] Edward Krimm with his special charisma shines on the stage\\".

Educated in France, he was the son of a rich and influential Greek-Romanian banker, LazƒÉr Kalenderoglu, and the brother of physician Nicolae Kalinderu. Like them, he was a sympathizer of the National Liberal Party, with which he debuted in politics in the 1880s. Kalideru was an expert in Roman law, but his attempts in the field, as well as his later studies in the history of Ancient Rome, are generally seen as minor contributions. His overall competence as an interpreter of law was questioned following his handling of the Strousberg Affair, although he served on the Court of Cassation and on international bodies of experts. Kalinderu stayed on as Carol's legal adviser, also helping him in direct negotiations with the National Liberal and Conservative political machines, and was several times considered for the office of Prime Minister. As administrator for the crown, Kalinderu enacted his vision of rural improvement, setting up model farms and a cottage industry, promoting literacy and the arts, and encouraging entrepreneurship. He viewed these methods as a working alternative to land reform, defending property rights during and after the peasants' revolt of 1907. He was praised for his passion and dedication, but also criticized for the uncertainty of their outcome. In addition to his agrarian project and his social work, Kalinderu played a significant part in promoting mountaineering and modern forestry, set up the resort of Bu»ôteni, and created his own art museum. A picturesque figure with eccentric customs, and often regarded as snobbish and servile, he became a stock character for the writers and cartoonists at Furnica magazine. His unfulfilled promise to donate his fortune to the public bled into a posthumous scandal which lasted into the interwar years.

Boerescu referred to Kalinderu as \\"a man of the new world, with very progressive ideas, and an excellent jurisconsult.\\"Vasile Boerescu, Discursuri politice, 1859‚Äî1883. Volumul II: 1874‚Äî1883, p. 110. Bucharest: Atelierele Grafice Socec & Co., 1910 At the time, his family was involved with the liberal-radical movement. Brother Nicolae, a Paris-trained physician, became one of the founders of the National Liberal Party in 1875.Bacalaba»ôa I, pp. 146, 153, 171, 258 The aged Kalenderoglu was founder of Creditul Rural, a credit union for the benefit of peasants, alongside major liberal figures.Bacalaba»ôa I, p. 115; Zane, p. 375 In 1875, Ioan also joined the National Liberals in opposing the concession of the Predeal railway to the Englishman George Crawley; alongside party leaders Ion BrƒÉtianu and Dimitrie Sturdza, he created an investment firm that tried to compete with Crawley for the contract.Bacalaba»ôa I, pp. 168‚Äì169 Kalinderu advanced on the public scene following the Strousberg Affair, during which Romania purchased back her railways from the bankrupt Prussian investor B. H. Strousberg. In February 1880, he and Strudza were dispatched to Berlin to negotiate payment of Strousberg's government bonds with the Imperial German authorities.\\"T√©l√©graphie priv√©e (s√©rvice t√©l√©graphique de l'agence Havas)\\", in Journal des D√©bats, February 29, 1880, p. 1 In April, Domnitor Carol I appointed him on the Princely Commission for the Administration of Railways, the embryonic CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne. The other members of this directorial triumvirate were Eugeniu StƒÉtescu and »òtefan FƒÉlcoianu.Constantin Gheorghe, Miliana »òerbu, Mini»ôtrii de interne (1862‚Äì2007). MicƒÉ enciclopedie, p. 95. Bucharest: Romanian Ministry of the Interior, 2007. Kalinderu maintained his office in Berlin until 1882, representing the newly established Kingdom of Romania. In 1882, he published a French-language tome dealing specifically with the legal implications of the Strousberg Affair: De la comp√©tence des tribunaux et particuli√®rernent des tribunaux prussiens dans toute contestation relative aux biens mobiliers qu'un √©tat √©tranger peut poss√©der en Prusse.Teodorescu et al, p. 849 As noted at the time by Titu Maiorescu, Kalinderu was responsible for placing his government in a humiliating position, and it was surprising that such a mission was entrusted to so unqualified an individual. BrƒÉtianu, who had taken over as Prime Minister, arrived in Berlin to personally supervise the negotiations, reportedly because the hastiness on the German side to seal off the deal \\"inspired in him grave disquietude\\".Documents diplomatiques fran√ßais, 1871‚Äì1914. 1re s√©rie (1871‚Äì1900); Tome III (2 janvier 1880 ‚Äì 13 mai 1881), p. 58.

Kalinderu earned additional favors from Carol I, crowned King of Romania, who appointed him his adviser on legal and agricultural matters. For a while, he served as administrator of the state-owned forest and fields. In June 1884, Kalinderu was named the first administrator of crown domains, which had been set aside by organic law,Mihaesco, pp. 196‚Äì197 resigning from his position at the railways company in December 1885.\\"Informa»õiuni\\", in Epoca, December 22, 1885, p. 3 Owned by the state and managed by the House of Hohenzollern (through Kalinderu), the domains originally included twelve country estates and two mountains of the Southern Carpathians: ClƒÉbucetul Taurului and Caraiman. During the first years of his new assignment, Kalinderu tried to pursue a parallel career in politics. He ran for Bucharest Council in 1886, second on the National Liberal list.\\"Candida»õii Partidului na»õional-liberal pentru alegerile comunale din CapitalƒÉ\\", in Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ, November 2/14, 1886, p. 1 He withdrew upon winning, citing his \\"many other engagements\\".\\"Ultime informa»õiunƒ≠\\", in Voin»õa Na»õionalƒÉ, November 6/18, 1886, p. 3 During the election of 1888, \\"I.

I\\", in Epoca, October 14/26, 1888, p. 1 He eventually handled the purchase of Strousberg railways, negotiating a loan for 175 million lei in 1889. In 1891, following the resignation of a Conservative Party government under Gheorghe Manu, Carol reportedly proposed Kalinderu as Prime Minister of an independent cabinet. This maneuver was rejected by the opposition National Liberals‚Äîthe refusal was instigated by a moribund BrƒÉtianu.Theodorian-Carada, pp. 106, 125 =Academy presidency= By 1888, Kalinderu was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy. Made titular in March 1893, he became chairman of its Historical Section in 1895‚Äì1897, and again in 1907‚Äì1910. He also served as Academy president from 1904 to 1907. The administrator of the Ioan Otetele»ôanu estate after winning the trial against his relatives in 1889,Teodorescu et al, pp. 849, 850 he donated most of it to the Academy. The fund included 900 hectares of land, and ran at 4 million gold lei.Bacalba»ôa II, p. 152 During his tenure there, Kalinderu marginalized Ioan Slavici, who had criticized his management,Ovidiu Papadima, \\"Ioan Slavici\\", in »òerban Cioculescu, Ovidiu Papadima, Alexandru Piru (eds.), Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne.

Ornea, Junimea »ôi junimismul, Vol. I, pp. 350‚Äì352. Bucharest: Editura Minerva, 1998. Kalinderu also reported to his former Berlin colleague Sturdza, by then the National Liberal Prime Minister, that Carol had dismissed him,Theodorian-Carada, p. 136 then negotiated a reunification of the Conservatives and Junimea defectors, prompted by the king's wish to have a stable government party.Marghiloman, p. 21 He had declined offers to replace Sturdza himself, favoring Theodor Rosetti or Ioan Lahovary for that position.\\"Informa»õii\\", in Epoca, July 21, 1898, p. 2 In 1896, Kalinderu restored the church on his own estate of Schitu-Greci, radically altering the overall design.Iona»ôcu, pp. 232, 241‚Äì242 He was particularly concerned with building and restoring Orthodox religious buildings on the king's domain,Marie of Romania, √énsemnƒÉri zilnice, p. 422.

It published the eponymous \\"people's encyclopedic magazine\\", Albina (\\"The Bee\\"), appearing between October 1897 and 1916. Kalinderu was the head editor, with George Co»ôbuc, Petre Dulfu, and Petre Vasiliu-NƒÉsturel serving as co-editors.Baiculescu et al., pp. 14‚Äì15 His work in public literacy also led him to establish Steaua Association. Joined by Constantin Banu and Spiru Haret, and later by Barbu »òtirbey and Alexandru Lapedatu, it had as its object the promotion of \\"moral, patriotic and useful publications\\", and the prevention, \\"by all lawful meas, of immoral writings and publications\\".\\"¬´Steaua¬ª\\", in Albina.

He was also offered chairmanship of the Romanian Athenaeum, but regretfully declined, arguing that he was caught up in his agricultural work. Instead, he promised to bequeath a \\"handsome sum\\" of money to the Athenaeum upon his death.»òtefan C. Ioan, \\"Amintiri din trecutul Ateneului Rom√¢n\\", in Cele Trei Cri»ôuri, Nr. 3‚Äì4/1944, pp. 60‚Äì61 In 1906, following Sturdza's second fall from office, Kalinderu was again tipped as the likely Prime Minister.C. Ulysse, \\"D. Sturdza la Rege. ‚Äì Un guvern Kalinderu\\", in Protestarea, March 8, 1906, p. 1 Described by Zigu Ornea as a \\"pseudo-historian\\", Kalinderu authored \\"risible\\" studies on Roman hairstyles,Titu Maiorescu (ed. Z. Ornea), T. Maiorescu »ôi prima genera»õie de maiorescieni, p. 348. Bucharest: Editura Minerva, 1978 which also drew much amusement from contemporaries.Gheorghe I. Bodea, Regele Carol al II-lea, p. 48. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Dacia, 2000. They were published in 1900‚Äì1901 as Portul barbeƒ≠ »ôi pƒïruluƒ≠ la Romanƒ≠ (\\"Beard and Hair Styling among the Romans\\") and Portul perucilor »ôi bƒÉrbieriƒ≠ la Romanƒ≠ (\\"Wigs and Barbers of the Romans\\"). Kalinderu's other publications have been characterized by Maiorescu as \\"compilations with no value\\". They include monographs on the praetorium ius (1885), on Roman municipal law and on the Byzantine Senate (both 1887), on the Twelve Tables (1888), on Roman vacationing (1895), on Augustus and his literary retinue (1897‚Äì1898), on Caesar's Civil War (1902), on clothing in ancient Rome (1903‚Äì1904), and on social life during the times of Pliny the Elder (1904).Teodorescu et al, pp. 849‚Äì851 He also published an homage to Stephen the Great, medieval Prince of Moldavia, studies of succession to the Romanian throne, and an Academy-sanctioned biography of Melchisedec »òtefƒÉnescu.Teodorescu et al, pp. 849, 850, 851 In an 1888 polemical tract, Une poign√©e de v√©rit√©s √† nos pr√©tendants (\\"A Fistful of Truths for Our Detractors\\"), Kalinderu and Alexandru Candiano-Popescu, using the shared pseudonym Un Paysan du Danube (\\"A Peasant of the Danube\\"), defended their work alongside the king.Teodorescu et al, p. 851 =Agrarian reformer= Kalinderu largely owed his ascent into prominent positions to his work at the crown domains and his influence with Carol I. However, his activity in agricultural and social improvement earned him respect. As early as 1898, Angelo de Gubernatis referred to his \\"powerful and positive work\\", calling Kalinderu \\"one of the most noble figures in today's Romania\\".Angelo de Gubernatis, La Roumaine et les roumains. Impressions de voyage et √©tudes, p. 21. Florence: Bernard Seeber libraire-√©diteur, 1898 Another visitor, Andr√© Bellessort, joked that the perpetually youthful \\"Mr. Kalindero\\" resembled \\"a rustic god\\", a patron of the farmers with \\"nitrogen eyes\\".Bellessort, pp. 849‚Äì851 Kalinderu's contributions to agricultural science and his activism, covered in a 1903 monograph by the agrarianist Vasile KogƒÉlniceanu,Teodorescu et al., p. 877 were praised by the sociologists: Dimitrie DrƒÉghicescu saw them as marked by an \\"entrepreneurial spirit, unrelenting in its activity\\";DrƒÉghicescu, p. 559 Nicolae MihƒÉescu-Nigrim called Kalinderu \\"one of the country's most eminent economists\\" and an \\"indefatigable administrator\\".Mihaesco, pp. 196, 201 As chemist Amuliu Proca notes, Kalinderu turned the domains into an \\"institution for defeating poverty, a factor in educating and culturally improving the villages\\". It \\"set an example of what may be accomplished, in a short while, by a country that was taking major steps in her development.\\" As summarized by the official press of his time, he \\"put all his efforts into directing peasants toward the cottage industry\\", created \\"home economics classes and adult education courses\\", and \\"was the first to speak\\" at educational conferences. He established a dairy factory, as well as shops for weavers, ropemakers, wainwrights and woodturners, and showcased their products at the 1900 World's Fair. Following Julius K√ºhn, Kalinderu insisted that the precondition of a \\"rational economy\\" was good livestock, so he inaugurated a freely accessible breeding program, also providing tenants with cultivars, or with beekeeping and sericulture implements.Mitu, pp. 309‚Äì311 He also reintroduced reforestation and forest farming where bad practices had affected the environment.Mitu, pp. 310‚Äì311 Kalinderu held the notion that the Romanian peasant was miserable for being illiterate, and that \\"all it takes is a set of favorable circumstances for him to display [his] talents\\".DrƒÉghicescu, p. 528 The efforts to educate his tenants were conjugated with those of Steauas Haret, by then National Liberal Minister of Education, providing young students with work experience and physical culture, as well as inculcating in them a patriotic awareness.Mitu, pp. 311‚Äì312, 313‚Äì315 A significant portion of his time was spent on teaching peasants to diversify their diet, including providing hired hands with daily rations of vegetables, meat and milk. This helped to prevent outbursts of pellagra.Mitu, pp. 315‚Äì316 In the Tavern, 1907 painting by Ludovic Bassarab In 1901, agronomist Constantin Sandu-Aldea acknowledged that there was a stark difference between \\"the mass of cultivators, who fall behind progress\\", and those living and working on crown lands. As he noted, the \\"intelligent and energetic\\" Kalinderu was managing his estate and his tenants backed by \\"all scientific data in modern agriculture.\\"C. Sandu, \\"Les engagements agricoles en Roumanie\\", in Journal d'Agriculture Pratique, de Jardinage et d'√âconomie Domestique, Vol. 65, 1901, p. 705 Modeling his effort on the Austrian colonization of Bosnia, Kalinderu financed research projects for his employees, sending many of them to study in Austria-Hungary.Mitu, pp. 312‚Äì313 On crown estates, management was divided between networks of forestry engineers, agricultural engineers, and accountants, who decided working hours and met budgetary requirements; workers received social security, including disability insurance.Mitu, pp. 303‚Äì306, 308‚Äì309 These and other contracts excluded drunkards and unmarried couples, with a view to promoting a stringent moral code.Mitu, p. 315 However, his attempts to uproot alcoholism and promote personal hygiene had mixed results, according to the left-wing Mihail Sadoveanu, who noted, sarcastically, \\"true enough, these days taverns have been replaced by bathhouses and libraries.\\"PƒÉdurean, p. 84 Likewise, a 1901 project to set up rural theaters was derided and parodied by Ion Luca Caragiale, in Moftul Rom√¢n. Reportedly, his order to build model libraries on the domains was actively sabotaged by the local curators, who would not allow peasants to consult them, or even to set foot in the buildings.Al. Lascarov-Moldovanu, Cruce »ôi na»õionalism. √énsemnƒÉrile unui trecƒÉtor, pp. 72‚Äì73. Bucharest: Editura Cugetarea, 1925 Kalinderu took over his father's seat at Creditul Rural, which financed the cottage industry and, in 1906, was chaired by Sturdza. The institution was rocked by scandals between its Conservative and National Liberal managers‚Äîwhen Sturdza stepped down in March 1906, Kalinderu became his replacement.Bacalba»ôa III, p. 113 His belief in self-help and his defense of landed-property rights against another land reform were highlighted after the peasants' revolt of 1907, during which his own estate at Schitu-Greci was ransacked. At the Progress in Forestry Society, he condemned the peasants' belief that \\"the state has a duty to provide them with land\\", and insisted that the root cause of the revolt was their failure to accept modernity and practicality. As he noted at the time, \\"on the crown domains, [...] the peasants never rebelled, but quite the contrary, defended property against invaders.\\"\\"Dl Kalinderu despre starea »õƒÉranilor\\", in Tribuna, Nr. 105/1907, p. 3 Mediating between the Conservatives and the king, Kalinderu obtained guarantees against the reform, although he and the crown advocated \\"a credit union under the control of the state, permitting peasants to accumulate more land of their own.\\"Marghiloman, p. 63 By then, he had resigned from his steering position at Creditul Rural, following an agreement with Dinu BrƒÉtianu, who replaced him.\\"Din Rom√¢nia\\", in Tribuna, Nr. 235/1907, p. 5 In 1908‚Äì1911, his Albina team also put out a weekly \\"social bulletin\\", providing Orthodox parsons and rural teachers with guidance in the field social work.Baiculescu et al., p. 71 =Art collector and courtier= Kalinderu's other ambitious ideas manifested themselves erratically, including a project for a girls' boarding school in Turnu MƒÉgurele, the \\"Otetele»ôanu Institute\\",PƒÉdurean, p. 85; Teodorescu et al, p. 849 which he launched without the Academy's approval. He was also involved in the development of the Bu»ôteni mountain resort, where he built a paper mill and a high school that today bears his name. He promoted ski, and a slope there is also named in his honor. Sorin Anghel, \\"P√¢rtia Kalinderu a»ôteaptƒÉ schiorii\\" , in Jurnalul Na»õional, November 24, 2005 His own estate increased by 1907, with the addition of 401 hectares at Seaca‚Äîleased out to the Predescu brothers‚Äîand other plots in Tecuci-Kalinderu.Stelu»õa Chefani-PƒÉtra»ôcu, Mo»ôieri teleormƒÉneni (1864‚Äì1949). MƒÉrire »ôi decƒÉdere (Publica»õiile Muzeului Jude»õean Teleorman, VI), pp. 283, 288, 294. Renaissance: Bucharest, 2011. From July 1906 onward,\\"Din Rom√¢nia. »òtiri dela expozi»õie\\", in Tribuna, Nr. 132/1906, p. 2 his other pet project was art collecting, with the goal of setting up a museum at his villa on Vasile Sion Street, near the Ci»ômigiu Gardens. The house itself, designed by Ion D. Berindey, cost 2 million gold lei to build, and was lavishly furnished. The collection included Ancient Greek pottery and works of design alongside art by Donatello, Andrea del Verrocchio, Giovanni Paolo Panini, Th√©odore G√©ricault, L√©on Bonnat, Auguste Raffet, and the complete collection of etchings by Piranesi. These were matched by a Romanian hall, with canvasses by Nicolae Grigorescu, »òtefan Luchian, Ion Andreescu, Camil Ressu and various others. The art world was skeptical of his tastes: Tudor Arghezi and Alexandru Lapedatu both noted that Kalinderu had amassed his objets without much discernment; later, art historian Petre Oprea concluded that Kalinderu was driven by \\"vainglory and a thirst for fame.\\"PƒÉdurean, pp. 81‚Äì82 Similarly, critic George Oprescu suggests that Ioan's taste in art was eclipsed by that of his physician brother Nicolae, who selected \\"all that is best\\" in the Kalinderu collection.George Oprescu, \\"Colec»õia de tablouri a Clubului Tinerimii\\", in Boabe de Gr√¢u, Nr. 2/1934, pp. 75‚Äì77 According to the fellow collector Krikor Zambaccian: \\"dapper, distant and implacable, the Smyrniote was haughty and did not tolerate competition\\". Zambaccian found his rival overall \\"harmless\\", even though he noted an incident in which an angry Kalinderu \\"decapitated\\" a work of sculpture.PƒÉdurean, pp. 82‚Äì83 Kalideru's other eccentricities attracted attention in their own right. Seen by contemporaries and later historians as excessively vain and hence susceptible, he was decorated with the ribbons of numerous European countries,PƒÉdurean, p. 78 holding the Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania, the Legion of Honour as Grand Officer, and, from 1903, the Grand Cordon of the Order of Osmanieh.Pierre Quillard, \\"Nouvelles d'Orient. Condamnations et d√©corations\\", in Pro Armenia, No. 65, July 15, 1903, p. 327 In one of his charges, Arghezi claimed that Kalinderu, the \\"Man with Violet Eyes\\", was entirely alien to the nation he claimed to rescue, a \\"purulent flower on the heights of our national life.\\" Lapedatu commented on his \\"wicked half-closed Oriental eyes\\", his \\"black mustache like that of Napoleon III\\", and his dress \\"in the English style, with wide pants, gray jacket, an enormous lapel flower and a tall gray hat\\". Constantin Argetoianu observed that although Kalinderu lacked all inclination toward sport or riding, he would go out every morning on a nag he could barely ride.PƒÉdurean, p. 79 Although this activity bored him, he would not have renounced it for anything, because he had read it was a habit of lords in London. Later, he became an ardent velocipedist, and was the only person with special permission to ride a velocipede in Ci»ômigiu. As seen by Radu R. Rosetti, Kalinderu appears \\"sententious, ridiculous, but very much appreciated by the King\\".Rosetti, p. 126 Reportedly, he worked for free at the crown domains, refusing to collect his salary: \\"The only rewards he desires are peasant blessings and his playing billiards with His Majesty.\\"Bellessort, p. 851 The king's appreciation was strictly contextual, a fact noticed by the politician Ion G. Duca: although Kalideru \\"entertained illusions\\" that he was personal friends with Carol, the latter \\"made sure to dispel it\\"; the courtier could be the king's \\"servant and useful instrument, but never his friend.\\"Duca, p. 102 Reportedly, Carol also ordered Kalinderu to admonish Crown Prince Ferdinand and Princess Marie for their lavish spending. Ion Bulei, \\"Acum un veac (XLII). Talentele Mariei (II)\\", in Ziarul Financiar, January 7, 2016 The future Queen Marie was much amused by Kalinderu, describing him as \\"little, round, with a short beard and a pronounced Semitic nose; one of his eyes sparkled wickedly, showing an unusually sharp intelligence\\". \\"Maria Regina Rom√¢niei. Un gentilom √Æn care regele Carol avea cea mai mare √Æncredere\\" , in Jurnalul Na»õional, June 1, 2013 She recalled a visit with him to Windsor Castle, where \\"it was truly amusing to see the short gentleman very pleased with himself, catching everything with his glimpse, weighing, judging, taking the measure of people and things, with that small, penetrating, almost wicked eye\\". Even when meeting Queen Victoria, his eye \\"roved throughout, as if he feared missing something\\". When he was shown the castle's art treasures, he observed them \\"with the superior air of a man in the know, of a man who was familiar with valuable collections\\".PƒÉdurean, p. 83 =Final years, death, and legacy= As noted by the queen, Kalinderu's \\"vain, self-satisfied appearance\\" became \\"a tireless temptation for caricaturists\\". During the nine years in which their activity overlapped, the magazine Furnica made him a buffoonish stock character in prose, poetry, and cartoons.PƒÉdurean, pp. 79‚Äì81 Furnicas George Ranetti also circulated serious charges against Kalinderu, accusing him of having run over a child with his car, and implying that he had used his connections to avoid prosecution.Kiriak Napadarjan, \\"Gardi»ôtii »ôi Furnica\\", in Furnica, Nr. 196/1908, p. 5 During the peasants' revolt, Furnica published a cartoon showing Kalinderu as a personification of Cajolery, interposing himself between Carol and The Truth (personified by a tenant farmer);Rosetti, p. 90 issues of that period were confiscated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.Baiculescu et al., p. 269 Reportedly, Kalinderu himself was generally aware of the mockery, but pretended to be \\"inviolable\\", and even incited Ranetti by riding his horse to his office. However, Furnica gleefully reported, he lost his temper with the painter Ion Theodorescu-Sion, who had contributed a set of cartoons to the campaign. According to the magazine, this incident showed his limitations as an art patron.PƒÉdurean, pp. 80‚Äì81 Among Kalinderu's late contributions as a philanthropist was his involvement with the Romanian Red Cross. From October 1912, he served on its general council, alongside Sturdza, Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, Grigore C. CrƒÉiniceanu, Nicolae Filipescu, and Alexandru Obregia.\\"Parte neoficialƒÉ. Anun»õuri administrative\\", in Monitorul Oficial, Nr. 184/1912, p. 8685 He spent the better part of 1913 in conflict with the Conservative government, headed by his old rival Maiorescu. Against Maiorescu, Kalinderu tried to persuade Carol not to renew the pact tying Romania to the Triple Alliance. Arguing that it constituted support for a German hegemony, he managed to postpone its ratification.Nicolae Iorga, Memorii. Vol. III: Triste»õea »ôi sf√¢r»ôitul unei domnii, p. 184. Bucharest: Editura Na»õionalƒÉ Ciornei, 1931. One of his final gestures was the intervention in favor of a proteg√© scholar, Orest Tafrali, for whom he obtained a chair at Ia»ôi University.NastasƒÉ, pp. 340, 518 He also made returns to scholarship, publishing in 1912 a commentary on the influence of Byzantine art on Romanian visual culture. It built on observations made by Gabriel Millet.Em. E. Kretzulescu, \\"DƒÉri de seamƒÉ. I. Kalinderu, NotƒÉ despre un studiu al d-lui Millet\\", in Revista pentru Istorie, Archeologie »ôi Filologie, Vol. XIII, Parts I‚ÄìII, 1912, pp. 385‚Äì387 Kalinderu died in December 1913, and was buried at Bellu cemetery, Plot 5, next to his father and his brother.Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, Necropola Capitalei, p. 80. Bucharest: Nicolae Iorga Institute of History, 1972 The funeral witnessed speeches by Constantin C. Arion, Constantin Istrati, Basile M. Missir, and Sabba »òtefƒÉnescu. Kalinderu intended to disinherit his relatives and see his name praised after giving lavish donations to royal and academic institutions of culture; however, none of the wills were written in legal form, so that Kalinderu's wealth largely ended up going to his family.Cazacu, p. 27; PƒÉdurean, pp. 83‚Äì84, 84‚Äì85 Argetoianu claims that Kalinderu had prepared a will benefiting his favorite institution, but ended up \\"quarreling with the Academy one year before his death\\", and failed to clarify his intentions in due time.Cazacu, p. 27 The mystery and scandal surrounding Kalinderu's last wish inspired a novella by Nicolae M. Condiescu. This fictionalizes one theory, according to which Kalinderu (\\"Conu Enake\\" in the story) writes down a will donating his fortune to the Academy, then destroys it on a whim.PƒÉdurean, p. 85 According to historian Matei Cazacu, the same events are also echoed in Mateiu Caragiale's 1929 novel, Craii de Curtea-Veche.Cazacu, pp. 26‚Äì27 From 1914, Kalideru's job at the crown domains went to Barbu »òtirbey.Duca, p. 125; Mitu, p. 303 A museum bearing Ioan and Nicolae's names, containing their respective art collections, opened the same year. The first private art museum in the country, it suffered damages during World War I: its Romanian-art section was evacuated during the battle of Bucharest, then confiscated by Bolshevik Russia. Kalinderu's park at Schitu-Greci was vandalized during the war and, by 1934, had still not been repaired. Reopened during the interwar with the remainder of its collection, the Kalinderu Museum had Jean Alexandru Steriadi as its last director.Adrian Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx. O introducere √Æn istoria comunismului rom√¢nesc, p. 138. Bucharest: Editura Curtea Veche, 2005. It was eventually closed in 1946, Doinel Tronaru, \\"Muzeul Kalinderu va rena»ôte din propria-i cenu»ôƒÉ\\", in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, September 23, 2005 shortly before the inauguration of a Romanian communist regime. Following the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Kalinderu's work and legacy were revisited: in 2005, a project to reestablish a Kalinderu Museum was being debated. In January 2014, the centennial of Kalinderu's death was solemnly marked by the General Association of Romanian Engineers, which discussed opening up a museum of the crown domains in Segarcea.

In the song, Tus proudly boasts of illegally importing Bulgarian, Romanian and Russian women for a cheap price, so that they can be \\"used\\" by young Greek men. The song has provoked harsh criticism from Greek feminist organizations, as well as from Central and Eastern European immigrants to Greece. The Greek General Secretariat for Gender Equality (an official government agency) has officially condemned the song as sexist and racist, and has stated that it will try to have the song removed from all Greek media. Tus himself denies being racist or sexist, and states that the aim of the song is to raise awareness to the issue of human trafficking, which, he claims, is hypocritically and superficially dealt with by Greek media; he has also stated that he will not be cowed by the media's attempts to silence and censor his work.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc7m-kwSAok =Background to the song= Human trafficking is prevalent in Greece, especially in Athens.

Background The municipality of Pachuca has a long history of gold and silver mining, but during the Mexican War of Independence (1810‚Äì1821) much of the infrastructure was destroyed and many of the mines became flooded. A group named the Real del Monte Company was formed in 1824 and arranged to bring mining equipment and experienced miners from Cornwall. After landing on Mocambo beach, south of Veracruz, the miners took 14 months to struggle through swamps and rain forests to Real del Monte. The Cornish brought cultural traditions that included football, wrestling and baking pasties. Although the Cornish community shrank after the 1911 revolution, some Cornish names survive. There are buildings and houses with European architecture, including Francis Rule's Methodist Church. History The CMCS was founded in 2006. The objectives were to foster historic cultural ties between Cornwall and Mexico, particularly the municipalities of Pachuca and Real del Monte in Hidalgo, to enable cultural links to be reestablished between the two mining districts. The driving force was the late Richard Williams, who had been visiting \\"Little Cornwall\\" in Mexico since 1998. There were plans for society members to visit Mexico in July 2008 and retrace the route the original party took in 1825‚Äì26, reaching Real del Monte on Miner's Day. In September 2008 Dave Evan and 30 other members of the association travelled to Mexico to explore the route taken by their ancestors. Jean Charman, Mayor of Camborne, and the historian Richard Williams accompanied the group. In 2008 the Cornish-Mexican Cultural Society helped arrange for Real del Monte and Redruth in Cornwall to be twinned. The 3-day International Pasty Festival was launched in Real del Monte in October 2009. Richard Williams, president of the Sociedad Cornish Mexicana, was among those present. In May 2011 the society published Mining a Shared Heritage: Mexico‚Äôs ‚ÄòLittle Cornwall‚Äô, written by the specialist in Cornish mining migration, Sharron Schwartz. It explored the historic links and the way in which families in Mexico and Cornwall are renewing those links. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall visited Real del Monte on the Day of the Dead in 2014. They visited the Pasty Museum, where the couple made pasties. According to Stephen Lay, CMCS spokesman, \\"It's uncanny, the Cornish influence is abundantly clear even today ‚Äì pasties are probably even more popular and widely produced than in Cornwall itself.\\" Notes Sources     Cornish culture Cultural heritage of Mexico Pachuca Cornish diaspora ","title":"Cornish Mexican Cultural Society"},{"id":"51304335","text":"Gaius Laecanius Bassus Caecina Paetus was a Roman senator of the early Roman Empire, whose known career flourished under the reign of Vespasian.

The work was commissioned by the Minnesota Orchestra for the soprano Dawn Upshaw. It was first performed by Upshaw and the Minnesota Orchestra under the direction of David Zinman in Minneapolis on January 6, 1999. The piece is dedicated to the composer's son, Adrian Rouse.Rouse, Christopher (1998). Kabir Padavali: Program Note by the Composer. Retrieved August 11, 2016. Composition =Background= Rouse first encountered the work of Kabir while studying North Indian classical music in the early 1970s. In 1972, Rouse composed a different piece for soprano and orchestra titled Kabir Padavali, which was never performed. Over two decades later, a commission from the Minnesota Orchestra provided him the chance to re-explore Kabir's poetry. Rouse started the composition on the new piece in 1997 and completed it at his home in Pittsford, New York, on January 12, 1998. Rouse selected six poems on which to set his music from translations of Kabir's poetry by Linda Hess, Robert Bly, and Rabindranath Tagore. Linda Hess and Douglas Brooks later provided the composer with transliterations for the text from Sanskrit. Though the music is sang in Hindi, Rouse otherwise elected not to compose the piece in the style of Hindu music. He reflected in the score program notes: =Structure= Kabir Padavali has a duration of approximately 28 minutes and is cast in six movements: #Bijak shabda 69 #Tagore 50 #Bijak sabda 55 #Bijak sabda 4 #Tagore 92 #Tagore 97 =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo soprano and an orchestra consisting of two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, celesta, accordion, harp, and strings. Reception =Critical response= Kabir Padavali has been praised by music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Michael Anthony of the Star Tribune called it \\"an ear-catching, evocative piece\\" and wrote, \\"Rouse doesn't try to reproduce ragas or Hindi vocal styles, though he uses occasional drones throughout the cycle. His goal seems to be more the creation of an exotic atmosphere than an exercise in ethnomusicology... the results are striking and beautiful throughout, from the sensuous oboe theme at the beginning (which returns at the end), to the subtle interweaving of voice and flute in the second song, to the rapturous tone of the final pages: the voice humming while the percussion makes sounds like those of rattlesnakes.\\" The piece was later praised by Priscilla McLean of the Times Union and Geraldine Freedman of The Daily Gazette, who described the score as \\"complex, colorful, and rhythmically and harmonically multi-layered.\\" =Awards= A recording of Kabir Padavali, performed by the soprano Talise Trevigne and Albany Symphony Orchestra, was nominated for the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Solo.

The episode was written by series creators Jim Kouf and David Greenwalt, and was directed by Eric Laneuville. Plot Opening quote: \\"It is not more surprising to be born twice than once; everything in nature is resurrection.\\" The zombified Nick (David Giuntoli) locates a family in a house in the woods and goes after them. The family manages to enter the house as Nick slams the door to get inside. He manages to enter and attacks the father while the rest of the family hide. Hank (Russell Hornsby) and Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) finally locate Nick in the house. They manage to prevent Nick from harming the family but they are being beaten by Nick so Hank is forced to throw a lamp at him to lure him outside. He and Monroe flee to a barn where they hide on the top of a hayloft and make a hole in the boards to make Nick fall on it. As Renard (Sasha Roiz), Rosalee (Bree Turner) and Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) arrive, Nick wakes up and slaps Juliette before finally getting injected by the antidote. As they're going to take him out, the father has come to kill him but Renard and Hank manage to send him away. In Vienna, Adalind (Claire Coffee) has gathered the dead poppies and puts them on Frau Pech's stomach and then stitching it and then a stream appears out of the body. Stefania (Shohreh Aghdashloo) then gives Adalind a jar where a substance is getting contained inside from Frau Pech's stomach. Later, under her instructions, Adalind rubs the substance on her stomach, causing an image of a skull before fading away. In the station, Renard learns that Eric was killed by a car bomb after arriving in Vienna. He then contacts a man named Meisner (Damien Puckler), who was responsible for the bomb. Upon seeing that two detectives have the surveillance files on the fight in the bar, Renard steals it and keeps it on his desk. In the spice shop, Nick finally wakes up from his zombie condition but can't remember what happened during his period as a zombie. Seeing he attacked the bar, they convince him he wasn't controlling himself and Juliette suggests he goes home to rest. Hank learns from Wu (Reggie Lee) that one of the men who attacked Nick died in the hospital after the incident. He confides with Renard that as he, Rosalee and Juliette were in the scene, they will be interrogated. They meet with them in the spice shop and agree on devising the same story and details, and decide not to tell Nick about the man killed. While sleeping with Nick, Juliette finds he is getting cold, his skin is turning gray and there's no heartbeat. She is about to call an ambulance when he wakes up, seemingly not realizing what happened. After questioning Renard, the detectives go to interrogate Rosalee in the spice shop. They then leave to question Juliette in their house, revealing the killing to Nick. After the questioning ends and the detectives leave, Nick decides to turn himself in even if he wasn't controlling himself. He is stopped in the station by Hank, who states that they only hid the truth to protect him. Nick walks into the station and talks with Renard about it. Renard then shows him the footage that shows that the man was about to kill Nick before Nick beat him up. He is convinced by Renard to not turn himself in as the Royal family would want that.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Little improvements continue to signal that Grimm now has a firmer handle on its central cadre of characters and larger storytelling aims while eliminating the more uneven aspects of the show. It's a working ensemble with much stronger chemistry that can now undulate as conflicts arise, but uniting everyone other than Nick together as a team is an important step to delving into the supporting characters as much as the first two seasons focused on Nick's development and David Giuntoli's growing comfort in the role. Whether that will step down a notch when the main focus isn't on Nick's recovery and is instead on solving the case of the new scary Wesen in town remains to be seen. But 'PTZD' brought the first big story of the season down for an exciting landing without the same fate as the plane Nick was on in the premiere.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"The ramifications of Nick's time as a member of the undead came quickly in Grimm Season 3 Episode 2, as everyone he cares about is now completely swept along in the cover up.\\" References External links  Grimm (season 3) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"PTZD"},{"id":"51304469","text":"Aleksander Sekuliƒá (born 24 February 1978) is a Slovenian basketball coach.

A graduate of Georgetown University and Harvard University, she began her media career as a producer for Huckabee on Fox News and later worked as a commentator on CNN. In 2017, she was appointed national spokesperson for the Republican National Committee. On April 7, 2020, she was appointed to the position of White House press secretary in the Trump administration. Early life Born and raised in Tampa, Florida, McEnany is the daughter of commercial roofing company owner Michael McEnany and Leanne McEnany. McEnany attended the Academy of the Holy Names, a private Catholic preparatory school in Tampa. After graduating, she majored in international politics at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C. and she studied abroad at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. While at Oxford, she was taught politics by future British Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds. After graduating from Georgetown, McEnany spent three years as a producer on the Mike Huckabee Show. From there, McEnany enrolled at the University of Miami School of Law, before transferring to Harvard Law School. Huckabee said that \\"one of the reasons [McEnany] went on to law school was because she didn't see she was going to have an on-air opportunity at Fox anytime soon.\\" At the Miami School of Law, McEnany was a recipient of the Bruce J. Winick Award for Excellence, a scholarship awarded to students in the top 1% of their class. She graduated from Harvard in 2016. Career As a college student, McEnany interned for several politicians, including Tom Gallagher, Adam Putnam and George W. Bush, and later worked in the White House Office of Communications, where she wrote media briefings. = Media roles = While in law school, McEnany appeared on CNN as a paid commentator. She supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. However, in early 2015, before becoming a Trump supporter, McEnany was highly critical of him, declaring on CNN and Fox Business that \\"Donald Trump has shown himself to be a showman\\" and it was \\"unfortunate\\" and \\"inauthentic\\" to call him a Republican. McEnany called his comments about Mexican immigrants \\"racist\\". She began supporting Trump after receiving advice over cocktails from Michael Marcantonio, a fellow summer associate at a law firm and a Democrat. He told her that \\"Donald Trump is going to be your nominee,\\" and if \\"a smart, young, blond Harvard graduate\\" wanted \\"to get on television and have a career as a political pundit, you would be wise to be an early backer.\\" According to The Guardian, she took this advice. On August 5, 2017, McEnany left her position at CNN. The following day, she hosted a 90-second webcast, Real News Update on Trump's personal Facebook page. She praised Trump throughout the segment, saying she had brought the \\"real news\\" to the American people. Former employer Mike Huckabee has called her a \\"meticulous researcher\\" and \\"extraordinarily prepared.\\" Her rapid occupational success was noted by Van Jones, CNN commentator and liberal activist who worked with her at CNN. \\"I'm not trying to defend the messaging, but what I hope people can acknowledge is there's very few people in either party who can accomplish what Kayleigh has accomplished in such a short time... People keep taking her lightly, and they keep regretting it.\\" =Republican political strategist= McEnany has been closely associated with the Republican Party since she was in college. She was critical of the Obama presidency, and in 2012 posted several tweets questioning Barack Obama's birthplace, echoing the \\"birther\\" conspiracy theorist movement. In 2012, McEnany tweeted about Obama's half-brother Malik Obama, who lives in Kenya: \\"How I Met Your Brother ‚Äì Never mind, forgot he's still in that hut in Kenya\\". Kayleigh McEnany speaking at the 2018 Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland In 2017, she responded to claims it was hypocritical of Trump to visit his golf course while president by mistakenly claiming that President Obama rushed off to a golf game after the 2002 beheading of Daniel Pearl. Obama was a state senator at the time of Pearl's murder. McEnany later apologized for the comment, noting that Obama went golfing after the 2014 murder of another journalist, James Foley, who was beheaded by ISIS in Syria. Obama, who was vacationing on Martha's Vineyard at the time, admitted that he should have \\"anticipated the optics\\" of golfing immediately after making a press statement on Foley's death. On August 7, 2017, the Republican National Committee (RNC) appointed McEnany as its national spokesperson. In 2017, as RNC spokeswoman, McEnany supported Trump amid a bipartisan backlash in response to his comments about a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which he suggested that white supremacists and anti-racist counterprotesters shared blame for violence; in a tweet, McEnany wrote that the Republican Party supported Trump's \\"message of love and inclusiveness.\\" Despite Trump's well-documented history of false and misleading statements, in August 2019, McEnany told CNN's Chris Cuomo: \\"I don't believe the president has lied.\\" In the weeks prior to her appointment as White House press secretary, McEnany praised Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying, \\"This president will always put America first, he will always protect American citizens. We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here, we will not see terrorism, and isn't that refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of Barack Obama?\\" In a radio interview on The Pat Miller Program on March 11, 2020, McEnany said Democrats were trying \\"to politicize\\" the coronavirus and that Democrats were almost \\"rooting for this outcome.\\" In the weeks following, McEnany was criticized for her remarks. Author Grant Stern tweeted \\"Kayleigh McEnany is coming to the White House with new 'alternative facts' about #coronavirus. The rest of the world calls them lies.\\" McEnany responded that she was referring to Trump's travel ban. =White House press secretary= After Mark Meadows replaced Mick Mulvaney as White House chief of staff in April 2020, Meadows's first personnel change was hiring McEnany as White House press secretary on April 7, 2020, which was officially announced the next day. Stephanie Grisham, who had served in the role and as White House communications director since June 2019, became First Lady Melania Trump's chief of staff and spokesperson. Two months into her tenure, the Associated Press wrote of McEnany, she \\"has made clear from her first briefing that she‚Äôs willing to defend her boss‚Äôs view of himself as well as his most flagrant misstatements.\\" In April 2020, McEnany defended Trump's assertion that the World Health Organization had shown a \\"clear bias towards China\\" and said that the WHO put Americans at risk by \\"repeating inaccurate claims peddled by China during the coronavirus pandemic\\" and \\"opposing the United States' life-saving travel restrictions.\\" When Trump was criticized by experts for suggesting at a press conference that the coronavirus could be treated with disinfectant injections, McEnany said that his remarks were taken out of context. Trump later said the suggestion was sarcastic, although there was no indication in his statement that he was making a joke. McEnany at a press conference in May 2020 On May 1, 2020, as part of her first public press briefing and the first one by a White House press secretary in 417 days, McEnany was asked by an Associated Press reporter: \\"Will you pledge to never lie to us from that podium?\\" McEnany replied: \\"I will never lie to you. You have my word on that.\\" On the subject of Trump's responses to the coronavirus pandemic, she claimed, \\"This president has always sided on the side of data\\". In response to allegations of Trump's sexual misconduct, McEnany said: \\"He has always told the truth.\\" McEnany falsely claimed that the Mueller Report as part of the larger investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 Presidential election had resulted in a \\"complete and total exoneration of President Trump,\\" despite the report reading ‚ÄúAccordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.‚Äù Amid reports on May 8, 2020, that the White House was \\"shelving\\" the release of COVID-19 re- opening guidelines, McEnany said that the guidelines had not been approved by Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Following Associated Press reports that Redfield had previously cleared the release of the guidance, Redfield addressed the issue personally, saying that the documents were still in \\"draft form\\" and had been released for \\"interagency review\\", not for public dissemination. That same week, Obama, in a private phone call with members of his former administration, described the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus crisis as \\"an absolute chaotic disaster\\". McEnany responded the next day by providing a statement to CNN claiming that, to the contrary, the \\"response has been unprecedented and saved American lives.\\" In May 2020, McEnany defended Trump's false accusation that Joe Scarborough had a person murdered, offering no evidence in support of the accusation. The same month, McEnany defended claims that Trump made about the dangers of vote by mail, repeating his inaccurate claims that vote by mail has a \\"high propensity for voter fraud.\\" McEnany herself has voted by mail 11 times in 10 years. In June 2020, she defended the decision by the Trump administration to forcibly remove peaceful protestors using smoke canisters, pepper balls, riot shields, batons, officers on horseback and rubber bullets so that Trump could stage a photo op in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square in Washington. She likened Trump's action to that of Winston Churchill walking the streets to survey bomb damage during World War II. When General Jim Mattis, former secretary of defense in the Trump administration, condemned Trump's action, McEnany described Mattis' comments as \\"little more than a self-promotional stunt to appease the DC elite.\\" In McEnany's September 9, 2020 White House press briefing, when asked about revelations from Bob Woodward's recorded interviews of Trump in Woodward's forthcoming book Rage, McEnany falsely asserted, \\"The president never downplayed the virus.\\" In fact, Trump repeatedly and publicly downplayed the risk of the virus and the severity of the pandemic, and in a recorded March 19, 2020 interview with Woodward said, \\"I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.\\" In response to McEnany's comment, Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple wrote that she had sacrificed her credibility; while Joe Lockhart, who served as White House Press Secretary during the Clinton administration, wrote her answers confirmed her as a \\"state propagandist\\". Personal life McEnany married Sean Gilmartin, a pitcher for the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team, in November 2017. The couple have one daughter, Blake, born in November 2019. Due to a BRCA mutation that put her at high risk of developing breast cancer, McEnany underwent a preventative double mastectomy in 2018. On October 5, 2020, McEnany tested positive for COVID-19. Even though she had interacted with individuals who had been diagnosed with coronavirus days prior, McEnany on several occasions spoke with the press while not wearing a mask before she ultimately tested positive for the coronavirus. McEnany tested negative multiple times since the beginning of the White House COVID-19 outbreak prior to testing positive on October 5. Among McEnany's staff members to also test positive for COVID-19 was Chad Gilmartin, the cousin of McEnany's husband.

The small port and holiday destination of St Mawes is on the western shore and is linked to Place Creek on the eastern shore by the Place Ferry. The ferry is used by walkers on the South West Coast Path. Geography The Percuil River is one of three major tidal creeks of the River Fal which flows into the deep tidal basin of Carrick Roads and out into Falmouth Bay. The creek is actually a ria, or drowned river valley which started to form in the Quaternary period. Sea-level rise during the Ipswichian interglacial flooded the valley, followed by the Devensian glacial, where sea- levels fell to 42 m below today's tides and the River Fal cut a deep sinuous valley into the bedrock. As the climate warmed, sea-levels rose again and the arctic tundra gave way to woodland. The sea continued to rise drowning the trees, leaving peat deposits which have been exposed nearby at Maenporth and Famouth. The stream and estuary combined is long and rises to the north of the A3078 near Treworthal. The highest tidal limit is at Trethern Mill where the streams runs for to enter the River Fal between Castle Point and Carricknath Point. At Trethern Mill the river is known as Trethem Creek () and there are four named minor creeks on the eastern side of the Percuil River where the valley of small streams enter the estuary. From north to south they are Polingey Creek (), Pelyn Creek (), Porth Creek () and Place (). Within the estuary the steep-sided banks provides a sheltered harbour in contrast to the exposed coast of Falmouth Bay, and the eastern coast of Roseland. The land around is largely anciently enclosed farmland containing well-drained, fine loamy soils with both arable and pastoral farming. Of similar early origin are the network of roads, tracks and farmsteads which surround the stream, with the exception of the lower eastern bank from St Mawes Castle to beyond Povarth Point, which is mostly late 20th-century housing. St Mawes Looking across the Percuil River estuary from St Mawes First mentioned in 1284 as Lavada or Lavousa (Cornish) and containing the element lann indicating an Early Christian enclosure, St Mawes never became a parish despite, in 1381 having a licensed chapel, cemetery and holy well. The village became a borough in the early 14th-century and the quay was first mentioned in 1539. From medieval times St Mawes was a busy fishing village and port despite being vulnerable to attack from Breton raiders. With the building of St Mawes Castle, one of Henry VIII's device forts which was constructed to the south-west of the village between 1540 and 1542, the open sea became safer. Crab, oyster and the pilchard fisheries developed and pilots could reach incoming ships before their Falmouth rivals. As the port expanded supporting industries such as ropewalks, pilchard cellars and inns developed, and a watch-house was provided for the coastguard service. Maritime industries declined with the opening of the railway to Falmouth in 1863, to be replaced with a passenger steamer service, holiday destination and an exclusive residential and retirement village in the 20th-century. Place Opposite St Mawes is the small tidal creek of Place, which is the destination of the Place Ferry from St Mawes, and the departing or landing point for walkers on the South West Coast Path. The boathouse and slipway was used by the Percuil and St Mawes Ferry, for the twice daily steamer from Falmouth and the rowing ferry to St Mawes. Passenger traffic was mainly for estate workers and to take children to school. With the increasing use of roads the ferry became redundant but the service restarted in the 1980s, with the support of the Countryside Agency following the designation of the coast path as a National Trail. The sheltered beach on the southern shore, known as Cellar Beach was once the landing place for large catches of pilchards. Cellar refers to the spot where the pilchards were salted as a winter food for local consumption and for export to Mediterranean countries. Much of the wealth of the Spry family came from their fishing fleet, pilchard cellar and boat-building. The parish of St Anthony in Roseland is mentioned in the Domesday Book when it then belonged to the Bishop of Exeter. Place House is on the site of a small monastic cell which housed an Augustinian priory and one monk dating to sometime after 1140 when the parish was given to the Priory of Plympton in 1288. Place Priory was destroyed by French pirates in 1338 and dissolved in 1538; it is said the stone was quarried for the building of St Mawes Castle. A map of 1597 shows what appears to be an Elizabethan mansion built on the site and belonging to a Mr Davies. The house has been altered and enlarged over the years, and in 1851 remodelled by Sir Samuel Spry, the MP for Bodmin to give Place House its present-day appearance of a French chateau. In front of the house was the pond of a tidal mill which was known to have been in existence in 1540, and would have been used to mill grain for the priory. It was still working in 1812 and the lease was advertised in 1848. The pond was reclaimed from the sea in circa 1860 when the house was rebuilt, and is now the lawn in front of the house. The house was requisitioned by the War Office during World War II. St Anthony's church has been described, by Nikolaus Pevsner, as the best example of what a Cornish parish church looked like during the 12th and 13th-centuries. The church is almost unique because it retains it original medieval cruciform plan despite a 19th-century restoration by the Reverend Clement Carlyon, who was employed by his cousin Sir Thomas Spry. Carlyon rebuilt the chancel, designed the pulpit and pews and put in the floor tiles, stained glass and new wooden roof. Place House is next to the church and a room at the back of the house, with large rough carved beams, is said to be the rectory. It is connected to the nave by a door and short flight of steps. There are monuments to the Spry family who owned Place House including Admiral, Sir Richard Spry (1715‚Äì1775) who was Commander-in-Chief, North American Station and Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Station. The church is a Grade II*-listed building and now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. River trade There are a series of small quays on the west side of the creek which served the farms, and were places where boats could moor while waiting to go upstream on the rising tide. At the head of the estuary was Trethem Quay (), where there was a water mill, and coal was still being unloaded well into the 20th-century. There was a lime kiln and pilchard cellars at Trewince Quay () and on the opposite shore at The Piory () was a coal store, lime kiln, malthouse and a quay. As well as the tidal mill, mentioned above, at Point there were another two at the head of Polingey and Porth Creeks. To the north of Place, and up river, is Percuil () which is the destination of the road which links the river to Gerrans and Portscatho. There were pilchard cellars here in the late 16th-century and during the 19th-century there was a malthouse and coal store. Coal, guano for manure, oysters and roadstone were discharged from barges and ketches on to the beach, which was also used for ship repair and cleaning. The St Mawes steamer was met twice daily by a wagonette from Gerrans for mail and passengers and the 19th-century slipway still exists. To the south is an oyster keep. In the 19th-century there were boatyards with associated quays and pilchards cellars around Polvarth Point (), and at Freshwater Beach to the north there was a boatyard founded by the Peters family in 1790. The Freshwater Beach yard built working boats and was famous for their six-oar pilot gigs. World War II D-Day landing craft were converted and maintained at Polvarth. During the 20th-century St Mawes expanded along the west side of the estuary and Polvarth is now part of the village. Recreation The St Mawes to Place ferry links the two shores of the Percuil River and is necessary for those walking the South West Coast Path, which runs from Minehead in Somerset, along the coasts of Devon and Cornwall, to Poole Harbour in Dorset. The ferry can also be used for shorter walks along the river and creeks and to visit Portscatho and St Anthony Head.

He was a city councillor and a member of the Board of Governors of Smyrna. He was also founder and editor of the French and Greek newspapers 'La Reforme' and 'Imerisia' in the late Ottoman Empire. Biography Nikolaos Tsourouktsoglou was born in Smyrna (modern Izmir, Turkey) in 1861 to a Cappadocian Greek family originally from Kayseri in Cappadocia. As a child he attended and eventually graduated from the Evangelical School of Smyrna. After graduation he studied at the University of Munich and graduated with a Law degree. After graduation Nikolaos moved back to Smyrna where he eventually founded a French Language Newspaper called 'La R√©forme' in 1900. In 1901 he co-founded a Greek language newspaper called \\"Imerisia\\" (ŒóŒºŒµœÅŒ∑œÉŒØŒ±). Through his media outlets and Law background Nikolaos fought for the defence of his compatriots rights in the late Ottoman Empire. He was a member of the Board of Governors and council of Elders of Smyrna in the Vilayet of Aydin. During the Greco-Turkish War in August 1922, the Greek Military was defeated and the Turkish army entered the city of Smyrna. Tsourouktsoglou was arrested, along with other prominent Greek members of the city including the Metropolitan of Smyrna Chrysostomos Kalafatis and also Georgakis Klimanoglou. The Turkish military officer Nureddin Pasha ordered the execution of Tsourouktsoglou who was beheaded.

History The term L√ºgenpresse has been used intermittently since the 19th century in political polemics in Germany, by a wide range of groups and movements in a variety of debates and conflicts.See also timeline in Isolated uses can be traced back as far as the Vorm√§rz period.Wiener Zeitung, 2 September 1835, p. 990; Allgemeine Zeitung, no. 69, 9 March 1840, p. 547 The term gained traction in the March 1848 Revolution when Catholic circles employed it to attack the rising, hostile liberal press. In the Franco-German War (1870‚Äì71) and particularly World War I (1914‚Äì18) German intellectuals and journalists used the term to denounce what they believed was enemy war propaganda. The made its mission the fight against the \\"lying press\\" which it considered to be the \\"strongest weapon of the enemy\\". After the war, German- speaking Marxists such as Karl Radek and Alexander Parvus vilified \\"the bourgeois lying press\\" as part of their class struggle rhetoric. The Nazis adopted the term for their propaganda against the Jewish, communist, and later the foreign press. During the protests of 1968, left-wing students disparaged the liberal-conservative Axel Springer publishing house, notably its flagship daily Bild, as a \\"lying press\\". 21st century usage =Germany= \\"L√ºgenpresse\\" banner seen in a Pegida demonstration In late 2014, the term was repopularised by the far-right political movement Pegida in response to what its protesters felt was a scornful treatment by the mainstream media, as well as biased press reporting on the rising migrant influx and other immigration issues. It was chosen to be the \\"Un-word of the year\\" for 2014 by a panel of five linguists and journalists of the Gesellschaft f√ºr deutsche Sprache for \\"wholesale defamation\\" of the work of the media. President Joachim Gauck condemned the chanting of the slogan as \\"ahistorical nonsense\\", maintaining that in contrast to the Nazi and the GDR era the federal German press is not manipulative in character and \\"covers events mostly in a correct and balanced way\\". Alternative for Germany chair Frauke Petry accused the German media of \\"defamatory\\" coverage of her party at a party congress at Hanover, but said the party executive would use the term \\"lying press\\" sparingly, preferring the milder designation \\"Pinocchio press\\". Her fellow party member Bj√∂rn H√∂cke criticized L√ºgenpresse as too sweeping a verdict for the journalistic profession, arguing instead for the alternative, phonetically very similar term 'L√ºckenpresse' (\\"gaps press\\"), which would describe more accurately reporting bias. German media detractors felt vindicated by the perceived lack of mainstream coverage of the 2016 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany. Most media outlets ignored the mass assaults by North African migrants and only started reporting on them five days later, after a wave of anger on social media made covering them unavoidable. The delay in reporting on the incidents led to accusations that the authorities and the media attempted to ignore or cover up the migrant attacks to avoid criticism against the asylum and migration policy of the Merkel government. Former interior minister Hans- Peter Friedrich (CSU) criticized the media for upholding a \\"cartel of silence\\": \\"There's suspicion that they believe they don't have to report on such assaults, especially involving migrants and foreigners, for fear of unsettling the public.\\" The German press codex at that time still advised against mentioning the religion or ethnicity of criminal suspects and offenders unless there was a \\"factual connection\\" to the crime. A 2015 poll by Infratest dimap found one-fifth of Germans using the term in reference to German media, including newspapers, radio and TV, while almost three-fourths do not employ the word. 42 percent have doubts about the media's credibility, whereas 52 percent believe its coverage to be reliable on the whole. According to a representative poll by the Allensbach Institute of the same year, 39 percent of adult Germans think that there is some truth to the criticism of Pegida that the mainstream press is distorting facts and concealing crucial information from the reader; in the new states of Germany this is believed by 44 percent of the population. Another 2015 survey, by the weekly Die Zeit, found that 50 percent of respondents did not trust the media coverage on the refugee crisis, 56 percent not on the Pegida movement, 63 percent not on the European debt crisis and 66 percent not on the Ukraine conflict. =United States= Prior to the 2016 Presidential election, the term began to be known in American society due to its usage by some, such as neo-Nazi Richard Spencer, president of the National Policy Institute (NPI). The term was also used at an October 2016 campaign rally in Cleveland, Ohio for Donald Trump.

These changes may effect underlying conditions such as addiction, cognition, and neurological development.  Mechanisms  Neuroepigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression in the neuron. Often, these changes take place due to recurring stimuli. Neuroepigenetic mechanisms involve proteins or protein pathways that regulate gene expression by adding, editing or reading epigenetic marks such as methylation or acetylation. Some of these mechanisms include ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, LINE1, and prion protein-based modifications. Other silencing mechanisms include the recruitment of specialized proteins that methylate DNA such that the core promoter element is inaccessible to transcription factors and RNA polymerase. As a result, transcription is no longer possible. One such protein pathway is the REST co-repressor complex pathway. There are also several non-coding RNAs that regulate neural function at the epigenetic level. These mechanisms, along with neural histone methylation, affect arrangement of synapses, neuroplasticity, and play a key role in learning and memory. = Methylation = DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are involved in regulation of the electrophysiological landscape of the brain through methylation of CpGs. Several studies have shown that inhibition or depletion of DNMT1 activity during neural maturation leads to hypomethylation of the neurons by removing the cell's ability to maintain methylation marks in the chromatin. This gradual loss of methylation marks leads to changes in the expression of crucial developmental genes that may be dosage sensitive, leading to neural degeneration. This was observed in the mature neurons in the dorsal portion of the mouse prosencephalon, where there was significantly greater amounts of neural degeneration and poor neural signaling in the absence of DNMT1. Despite poor survival rates amongst the DNMT1-depleted neurons, some of the cells persisted throughout the lifespan of the organism. The surviving cells reaffirmed that the loss of DNMT1 led to hypomethylation in the neural cell genome. These cells also exhibited poor neural functioning. In fact, a global loss of neural functioning was also observed in these model organisms, with the greatest amounts neural degeneration occurring in the prosencephalon.[1] Other studies showed a trend for DNMT3a and DNMT3b. However, these DNMT's add new methyl marks on unmethylated DNA, unlike DNMT1. Like DNMT1, the loss of DNMT3a and 3b resulted in neuromuscular degeneration two months after birth, as well as poor survival rates amongst the progeny of the mutant cells, even though DNMT3a does not regularly function to maintain methylation marks. This conundrum was addressed by other studies which recorded rare loci in mature neurons where DNMT3a acted as a maintenance DNMT. The Gfap locus, which codes for the formation and regulation of the cytoskeleton of astrocytes, is one such locus where this activity is observed. The gene is regularly methylated to downregulate glioma related cancers. DNMT inhibition leads to decreased methylation and increased synaptic activity.[2] Several studies show that the methylation-related increase or decrease in synaptic activity occurs due to the upregulation or downregulation of receptors at the neurological synapse. Such receptor regulation plays a major role in many important mechanisms, such as the 'fight or flight' response. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is the most studied of these receptors. During stressful circumstances, there is a signaling cascade that begins from the pituitary gland and terminates due to a negative feedback loop from the adrenal gland. In this loop, the increase in the levels of the stress response hormone results in the increase of GR. Increase in GR results in the decrease of cellular response to the hormone levels. It has been shown that methylation of the I7 exon within the GR locus leads to a lower level of basal GR expression in mice. These mice were more susceptible to high levels of stress as opposed to mice with lower levels of methylation at the I7 exon. Up-regulation or down-regulation of receptors through methylation leads to change in synaptic activity of the neuron. = Hypermethylation, CpG islands, and tumor suppressing genes = CpG Islands (CGIs) are regulatory elements that can influence gene expression by allowing or interfering with transcription initiation or enhancer activity. CGIs are generally interspersed with the promoter regions of the genes they affect and may also affect more than one promoter region. In addition they may also include enhancer elements and be separate from the transcription start site. Hypermethylation at key CGIs can effectively silence expression of tumor suppressing genes and is common in gliomas. Tumor suppressing genes are those which inhibit a cell's progression towards cancer. These genes are commonly associated with important functions which regulate cell-cycle events. For example, PI3K and p53 pathways are affected by CGI promoter hypermethylation, this includes the promoters of the genes CDKN2/p16, RB, PTEN, TP53 and p14ARF. Importantly, glioblastomas are known to have high frequency of methylation at CGIs/promoter sites. For example, Epithelial Membrane Protein 3 (EMP3) is a gene which is involved in cell proliferation as well as cellular interactions. It is also thought to function as a tumor suppressor, and in glioblastomas is shown to be silenced via hypermethylation. Furthermore, introduction of the gene into EMP3-silenced neuroblasts results in reduced colony formation as well as suppressed tumor growth. In contrast, hypermethylation of promoter sites can also inhibit activity of oncogenes and prevent tumorigenesis. Such oncogenic pathways as the transformation growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling pathway stimulate cells to proliferate. In glioblastomas the overactivity of this pathway is associated with aggressive forms of tumor growth. Hypermethylation of PDGF-B, the TGF-beta target, inhibits uncontrolled proliferation. = Hypomethylation and aberrant histone modification = Global reduction in methylation is implicated in tumorigenesis. More specifically, wide spread CpG demethylation, contributing to global hypomethylation, is known to cause genomic instability leading to development of tumors. An important effect of this DNA modification is its transcriptional activation of oncogenes. For example, expression of MAGEA1 enhanced by hypomethylation interferes with p53 function. Aberrant patterns of histone modifications can also take place at specific loci and ultimately manipulate gene activity. In terms of CGI promoter sites, methylation and loss of acetylation occurs frequently at H3K9. Furthermore, H3K9 dimethylation and trimethylation are repressive marks which, along with bivalent differentially methylated domains, are hypothesized to make tumor suppressing genes more susceptible to silencing. Abnormal presence or lack of methylation in glioblastomas are strongly linked to genes which regulate apoptosis, DNA repair, cell proliferation, and tumor suppression. One of the best known examples of genes affected by aberrant methylation that contributes to formation of glioblastomas is MGMT, a gene involved in DNA repair which encodes the protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase. Methylation of the MGMT promoter is an important predictor of the effectiveness of alkylating agents to target glioblastomas. Hypermethylation of the MGMT promoter causes transcriptional silencing and is found in several cancer types including glioma, lymphoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and retinoblastoma.  Neuroplasticity  Neuroplasticity refers to the ability of the brain to undergo synaptic rearrangement as a response to recurring stimuli. Neurotrophin proteins play a major role in synaptic rearrangement, amongst other factors. Depletion of neurotrophin BDNF or BDNF signaling is one of the main factors in developing diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and depression. Neuroplasticity can also occur as a consequence of targeted epigenetic modifications such as methylation and acetylation. Exposure to certain recurring stimuli leads to demethylation of particular loci and remethylation in a pattern that leads to a response to that particular stimulus. Like the histone readers, erasers and writers also modify histones by removing and adding modifying marks respectively. An eraser, neuroLSD1, is a modified version of the original Lysine Demethylase 1(LSD1) that exists only in neurons and assists with neuronal maturation. Although both versions of LSD1 share the same target, their expression patterns are vastly different and neuroLSD1 is a truncated version of LSD1. NeuroLSD1 increases the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) involved in cell maturation. Recurring stimuli lead to differential expression of neuroLSD1, leading to rearrangement of loci. The eraser is also thought to play a major role in the learning of many complex behaviors and is way through which genes interact with the environment.  Neurodegenerative diseases  = Alzheimer's disease = Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease known to progressively affect memory and incite cognitive degradation. Epigenetic modifications both globally and on specific candidate genes are thought to contribute to the etiology of this disease. Immunohistochemical analysis of post-mortem brain tissues across several studies have revealed global decreases in both 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in AD patients compared with controls. However, conflicting evidence has shown elevated levels of these epigenetic markers in the same tissues. Furthermore, these modifications appear to be affected early on in tissues associated with the pathophysiology of AD. The presence of 5mC at the promoters of genes is generally associated with gene silencing. 5hmC, which is the oxidized product of 5mC, via ten-eleven-translocase (TET), is thought to be associated with activation of gene expression, though the mechanisms underlying this activation are not fully understood. Regardless of variations in results of methylomic analysis across studies, it is known that the presence of 5hmC increases with differentiation and aging of cells in the brain. Furthermore, genes which have a high prevalence of 5hmC are also implicated in the pathology of other age related neurodegenerative diseases, and are key regulators of ion transport, neuronal development, and cell death. For example, over-expression of 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX), an enzyme which generates pro-inflammatory mediators from arachidonic acid, in AD brains is associated with high prevalence of 5hmC at the 5-LOX gene promoter region. = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis = DNA modifications at different transcriptional sites have been shown to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. These include harmful transcriptional alterations such as those found in motor neuron functionality associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, which contributes to muscle atrophy in ALS patients, is linked to chromatin modifications among a group of key genes. One important site that is regulated by epigenetic events is the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 within the chromosome 9p21. Hypermethylation of the C9orf72 related CpG Islands is shown to be associated with repeat expansion in ALS affected tissues. Overall, silencing of the C9orf72 gene may result in haploinsufficiency, and may therefore influence the presentation of disease. The activity of chromatin modifiers is also linked to prevalence of ALS. DNMT3A is an important methylating agent and has been shown to be present throughout the central nervous systems of those with ALS. Furthermore, over-expression of this de novo methyl transferase is also implicated in cell death of motor-neuron analogs. = Neuro-oncology = A multitude of genetic and epigenetic changes in DNA profiles in brain cells are thought to be linked to tumorgenesis. These alterations, along with changes in protein functions, are shown to induce uncontrolled cell proliferation, expansion, and metastasis. While genetic events such as deletions, translocations, and amplification give rise to activation of oncogenes and deactivation of tumor suppressing genes, epigenetic changes silence or up-regulate these same genes through key chromatin modifications. = Neurotoxicity = Neurotoxicity refers to damage made to the central or peripheral nervous systems due to chemical, biological, or physical exposure to toxins. Neurotoxicity can occur at any age and its effects may be short-term or long-term, depending on the mechanism of action of the neurotoxin and degree of exposure. Certain metals are considered essential due to their role in key biochemical and physiological pathways, while the remaining metals are characterized as being nonessential. Nonessential metals do not serve a purpose in any biological pathway and the presence and accumulation in the brain of most can lead to neurotoxicity. These nonessential metals, when found inside the body compete with essential metals for binding sites, upset antioxidant balance, and their accumulation in the brain can lead to harmful side effects, such as depression and intellectual disability. An increase in nonessential heavy metal concentrations in air, water and food sources, and household products has increased the risk of chronic exposure. Acetylation, methylation and histone modification are some of the most common epigenetic markers. While these changes do not directly affect the DNA sequence, they are able to alter the accessibility to genetic components, such as the promoter or enhancer regions, necessary for gene expression. Studies have shown that long-term maternal exposure to lead (Pb) contributes to decreased methylation in areas of the fetal epigenome, for example the interspaced repetitive sequences (IRSs) Alu1 and LINE-1. The hypomethylation of these IRSs has been linked to increased risk for cancers and autoimmune diseases later in life. Additionally, studies have found a relationship between chronic prenatal Pb exposure and neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and schizophrenia, as well as developmental issues. Furthermore, the acetylation and methylation changes induced by overexposure to lead result in decreased neurogenesis and neuron differentiation ability, and consequently interfere with early brain development. Overexposure to essential metals can also have detrimental consequences on the epigenome. For example, when manganese, a metal normally used by the body as a cofactor, is present at high concentrations in the blood it can negatively affect the central nervous system. Studies have shown that accumulation of manganese leads to dopaminergic cell death and consequently plays a role in the onset of Parkinson's disease (PD). A hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the accumulation of Œ±-Synuclein in the brain. Increased exposure to manganese leads to the downregulation of protein kinase C delta (PKCŒ¥) through decreased acetylation and results in the misfolding of the Œ±-Synuclein protein that allows aggregation and triggers apoptosis of dopaminergic cells.  Research  The field has only recently seen a growth in interest, as well as in research, due to technological advancements that facilitate better resolution of the minute modifications made to DNA. However, even with the significant advances in technology, studying the biology of neurological phenomena, such as cognition and addiction, comes with its own set of challenges. Biological study of cognitive processes, especially with humans, has many ethical caveats. Some procedures, such as brain biopsies of Rett Syndrome patients, usually call for a fresh tissue sample that can only be extricated from the brain of deceased individual. In such cases, the researchers have no control over the age of brain tissue sample, thereby limiting research options. In case of addiction to substances such as alcohol, researchers utilize mouse models to mirror the human version of the disease. However, the mouse models are administered greater volumes of ethanol than humans normally consume in order to obtain more prominent phenotypes. Therefore, while the model organism and the tissue samples provide an accurate approximation of the biology of neurological phenomena, these approaches do not provide a complete and precise picture of the exact processes underlying a phenotype or a disease. Neuroepigenetics had also remained underdeveloped due to the controversy surrounding the classification of genetic modifications in matured neurons as epigenetic phenomena. This discussion arises due to the fact that neurons do not undergo mitosis after maturation, yet the conventional definition of epigenetic phenomena emphasizes heritable changes passed on from parent to offspring. However, various histone modifications are placed by epigenetic modifiers such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) in neurons and these marks regulate gene expression throughout the life span of the neuron. The modifications heavily influence gene expression and arrangement of synapses within the brain. Finally, although not inherited, most of these marks are maintained throughout the life of the cell once they are placed on chromatin.

He played college football at Colorado. He also played for the Miami Dolphins and Arizona Cardinals. Professional career =New Orleans Saints= 2016 On May 1, 2016, the New Orleans Saints signed Crawley to a three-year, $1.62 million contract as an undrafted free agent that includes a signing bonus of $5,000. Throughout training camp, he competed for a roster spot against De'Vante Harris, Brandon Dixon, Brian Dixon, Damian Swann, Tony Carter, and Jimmy Pruitt. Crawley made a strong case for a spot on the active roster after turning in multiple impressive performances in practice while taking first team reps at outside cornerback while Keenan Lewis, Delvin Breaux, and Damian Swann were sidelined with injuries. After the release of Keenan Lewis, head coach Sean Payton named Crawley the third cornerback on the depth chart behind starters Delvin Breaux and P. J. Williams. He made his professional regular season debut in the New Orleans Saints' season-opener against the Oakland Raiders and recorded four solo tackles during their 35‚Äì34 loss. The following week, Crawley collected six combined tackles, deflected a pass, and forced the first fumble of his career as the Saints lost 16‚Äì13 at the New York Giants. During the first quarter, De'Vante Harris recovered the fumble after Crawley caused a fumble while tackling Giants' receiver Victor Cruz with teammate Jairus Byrd. On September 26, 2016, Crawley made his first career start after P. J. Williams was placed on injured reserve after suffering a serious concussion the week before. Crawley finished the Saints' 45‚Äì32 loss against the Atlanta Falcons with four solo tackles and two pass deflections. In Week 4, he made a season-high seven combined tackles and a pass deflection during their 35‚Äì34 win at the San Diego Chargers. Prior to Week 9, Crawley was demoted to a reserve role behind Sterling Moore and B. W. Webb. On December 28, 2016, Crawley suffered a dislocated knee in practice and was ruled inactive for the Saints' Week 17 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons. Williams finished his rookie season with 43 combined tackles (40 solo), eight pass deflections, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery in 15 games and five starts. 2017 Crawley entered training camp competing for the job as the third cornerback on the depth chart against Sterling Moore and rookie Marshon Lattimore. Head coach Sean Payton named Crawley the starting cornerback alongside P. J. Williams after Delvin Breaux suffered a fractured fibula. Crawley was inactive for the first two games (Weeks 1‚Äì2). On September 24, 2017, he started his first game of the season and recorded a season-high eight combined tackles and a pass deflection. In Week 3, Crawley made four solo tackles, two deflected passes, and made his first career interception off a pass attempt by Jay Cutler during the Saints' 20‚Äì0 victory against the Miami Dolphins. He was inactive for the Saints' Week 12 matchup at the Los Angeles Rams due to a strained oblique. He finished the season 54 combined tackles (47 solo), 17 pass deflections, and an interception in 13 games and 13 starts. He finished second on the team in pass deflections behind rookie Marshon Lattimore. He received an overall grade of 81.6 from Pro Football Focus, which was the 39th highest grade among cornerbacks. The New Orleans Saints finished first in the NFC South with an 11‚Äì5 record. On January 7, 2018, Crawley started his first career playoff game and recorded seven combined tackles and a pass deflection in the Saints' 31‚Äì26 victory against the Carolina Panthers in the NFC Wildcard game. The following week, he had six combined tackles as New Orleans lost 29‚Äì24 at the Minnesota Vikings. Crawley was flagged for pass interference on two consecutive plays in the first quarter. The two penalties combined for 54-yards and led to a field goal for the Minnesota Vikings. He was also on the receiving end of a missed tackle by fellow free safety Marcus Williams that knocked him over when the later was attempting to tackle an airborne Stefon Diggs on the final play of the game, which prevented both of them from having a chance to tackle Diggs. Diggs, in turn, was able to score a touchdown on that play to win the game for Minnesota. 2018 Crawley entered training camp stated as a starting cornerback.

A Mahoba inscription compares him to Purushottama (Vishnu), and states that crushed the haughty Lakshmi-Karna with his strong arms. Prabodha-Chandrodayam, a play written by Kirttivarman's contemporary Shri Krishna Mishra, states that a man named Shri Gopala defeated Lakshmi-Karna and caused the rise of Kirttivarman. Because this play was staged in Kirttivarman's court, it appears that Shri Gopala was held in high esteem by the king. Historians variously believe Gopala to be a feudatory, a general or a cousin of Kirttivarman. S. K. Mitra dates the battle to c. 1070 CE. Chandela inscriptions also credit Kirttivarman with other victories, stating that he vanquished several enemies and that his commands \\"reached the borders of the sea\\". The Muslim chronicle Diwan-i-Salman states that the Ghaznavid ruler Ibrahim (r. c. 1059-1099 CE) attacked the Chandela stronghold Kalanjara (modern Kalinjar). This suggests that Kirttivarman must have faced an invasion from Ibrahim. There is no evidence that Chandelas lost control of Kalanjara during his reign, so this invasion was probably a mere raid.  Administration  The 1098 CE Deogadh inscription names one Vatsaraja as Kirttivarman's chief minister. It records the construction of a series of steps on the banks of the Betwa River, which flows by the Deogardh fort. It also states that Vatsaraja built the fort (\\"Kirttigiri-durga\\"). Ananta was another important minister of Kirttivarman. His father Mahipala had served Kirttivarman's father Vijayapala. Ananta held several positions, including Mantri (counsellor), Adhimata-Sachiva (approved minister), Hastyavaneta (leader of elephants and horses), and Purabaladhyaksha (in-charge of the defence of the capital). Kirttivarman is believed to have commissioned the Kirat Sagar lake in Mahoba, the Kirat Sagar lake in Chanderi and the Budhiya Tal lake in Kalinjar are said to have been commissioned by Kirttivarman. According to folk tradition, he suffered from leprosy, and cured it by bathing in the Budhiya Tal.  Religion  The inscriptions from Kirttivarman's reign suggest that he was a Shaivite but also patronized Vaishnavism and Jainism. A Mau inscription portrays him as a righteous ruler who had conquered the six internal enemies. Unlike the previous Khajuraho temples featuring erotic sculptures, the temples built during and after Kirttivarman's reign do not feature sexual imagery. M. L. Varadpande believes that Kirttivarman shifted the Chandela capital from Khajuraho to Mahoba. Prabodhana-Chandrodaya, a play composed by Krishna Mishra during Kirttivarman's reign, is critical of overt sexual imagery in sculptural art. It ridicules the extreme Tantric sects like Kapalikas. The wall of a Shiva temple near Parmala tank in Ajaygadh bears the legend Shri-Kirtijayeshvara. This probably refers to Kirttivarman.  Coinage  The earliest of the extant Chandela coins are from Kirttivarman's reign. These are all gold coins weighing between 31 and 63 grains. The coins feature a seated goddess on one side, and the legend Shrimat Kirttivarmanmadeva on the other side. This style was originally introduced by the Kalachuri king Gangeya-deva. Kirttivarman may have adopted this style to commemorate his victory over Gangeya's son Lakshmi-Karna.

The episode was written by Andrew Kreisberg and Geoff Johns from a story by Greg Berlanti and Kreisberg and directed by David Nutter. It was first broadcast on October 14, 2014 in The CW. The show is itself an spin-off of the show Arrow, where many characters in the series were introduced during the second season. The episode revolves about Barry Allen (Grant Gustin), a CSI forensic scientist working for the Central City Police Department. During a visit to an event, the event is robbed by masked men. This is later revealed as the result of an accident during the accelerator explosion and the men are in fact a man who can duplicate himself. The episode also shows flashbacks when Barry tries to see his dad in jail, to Joe's disapproval. The episode received positive reviews, with critics stating that the series' mysteries and intrigue are helping it for the future. Plot With Cisco's help, Barry saves people from a burning building before the firefighters arrive. Caitlin chastises them for doing other people's job and reminds them that they need to focus on catching the humans affected by the accelerator explosion while Wells and Cisco note that his rate has increased. Barry is called by Joe to investigate a crime scene of a murder in a shop. While surveillance shows a man shooting the person, Barry notes that six people with somehow the same shoe size were responsible for the marks in the floor. Iris then reminds him of an event they were going to attend by Simon Stagg for a school assignment. The event is then assaulted by robbers, who steal jewelry. Barry tries to stop them but he faints before he can catch them. In S.T.A.R. Labs, the team deduce that Barry is getting hypoglycemic from the use of his abilities due to a sped-up metabolism and needs to ingest more calories to maintain his energy level. Joe has found that Barry is investigating Henry's arrest and Nora's murder and chastises him. This causes to remember when a young Barry ran away from their home to meet with his dad in jail, who is later shown to have asked Joe to keep his son from visiting him in prison. Barry in response admits that he grew up without his father although he knew he was innocent all the time and states that Joe is not his dad, hurting him. Stagg is attacked in his headquarters by the same robbers and Barry tries to defeat them but sees that they are duplicates of the man and escapes. The team deduce that the man is Danton Black, an ex-employer for Stagg who was fired after Stagg took credit for his work and may have been testing the duplicate test during the accelerator explosion. During a talk with Iris, Barry sees that she seems to know there is someone dubbed the \\"red streak\\" who is saving people at a high speed. Using an in vitro process from a cell, Caitlin manages to make a clone of Black. As the clone cannot move, the team deduce that Black is the original and the clones will stop when he is defeated. The clone begins to move and Joe shoots him, and they realize that the original Black is duplicating and heading to kill Stagg. Stagg's guards are killed by the clones. Barry tries to find Black but he makes hundreds of clones to disguise himself. Barry finds the original but when Black tries to kill him, he falls out a window. Barry holds him but Black refuses to be saved and falls to his death. Barry and Joe fix their problems, with Joe promising they will find out who killed his mother and free his father. Wells later visits Stagg and discuss Black, but Stagg states that his focus now is the Flash and plans to exploit his powers. Wells stands up and stabs Stagg to death, stating he needs to keep \\"the fastest man alive\\" safe. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 4.27 million viewers with a 1.7 rating in the 18-49 demographics. This was a 12% decrease in viewership from the pilot, which was watched by 4.83 million viewers with a 1.9 rating in the 18-49 demographics. The Flash ranked as the most watched program on The CW in the day, beating Supernatural and also the most watched in the week, beating Arrow. The CW re-aired the episode the following day on Wednesday, October 15, 2014 after Arrow. The episode was watched by 1.67 million viewers and achieved a 0.5 adults 18‚Äì49 rating. =Critical reviews= \\"Fastest Man Alive\\" received positive reviews from critics. Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.6 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"The Flash only got better in its second episode. The show benefits from a clear sense of confidence as it establishes Barry Allen's world and his relationships with both the crew at S.T.A.R. Labs and the West family. The show has its share of drama, but also plenty of superhero action and a general sense of lighthearted fun. Sure, it would be nice if the writers would develop their villains more before killing them off, but hopefully that problem will be addressed over time.\\" The A.V. Club's Scott Von Doviak gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"With the heavy lifting of establishing the Flash's origin, world, and supporting cast out of the way, 'Fastest Man Alive' gives us a better idea of what to expect from The Flash on a week-to- week basis. If it wasn't clear already that the TV version won't be shying away from the way-out sci-fi aspects of the comic books, this second episode makes it undeniable as the Scarlet Speedster goes up against a villain who can self-replicate into dozens, even hundreds of copies of himself.\\" Chancellor Agard of EW stated: \\"In hindsight, The Flashs series premiere might not have been as good as we all thought it was. Admittedly, it was great to finally have a DC Comics adaptation that respected and trusted the source material enough to not make the show 'dark' and 'gritty' to make it palatable to audiences. However, in all of this excitement, it was easy to miss how the pilot did not always completely gel together. There were several well-executed and exhilarating moments, but there were also just as many things that didn't work (most of the supporting cast and the dialogue). This week's episode, however, makes up for it and is a better indication of what the powers-that-be behind The Flash are capable of doing with the character.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"On a whole, though, 'Fastest Man Alive' very much followed the TV formula of 'repeat the pilot 5 or 6 times until the audience understands what the show is.' Not all of the story beats were identical, but enough of them were ‚Äî including Barry needing an inspirational speech from a mentor in order to beat the bad guy, the Freak of the Week dying, and Harrison Wells again demonstrating the ability to walk and knowledge of the future in the final scene ‚Äî that I'm hoping the creative team will shake things up soon.\\" References The Flash (2014 TV series) episodes 2014 American television episodes Television episodes about revenge ","title":"Fastest Man Alive"},{"id":"51305376","text":"The 21st Guards Motor Rifle Brigade is a formation of the Russian Ground Forces.

He was the nephew of another noted French physician, Jules Germain Cloquet. From 1840 Ernest worked at various clinical offices in Paris, and was a regular contributor to the Soci√©t√© anatomique. In 1846, with his thesis named De l‚Äôh√©matoc√®le vaginale, he was awarded his doctors degree in medicine, and later that year he was attached to the French mission in Tehran. He was appointed ambassador to the court and became the personal physician of the king (shah), succeeding another Frenchman named Dr. Labat.

When subsequently many followers of the Bab were arrested and executed, high-ranking officials at the king's court were formally invited to show their loyalty by personally participating in the executions; Cloquet did not participate, stating that it would violate his Hippocratic oath. He carried out a programme of research on cholera. Cloquet himself witnessed two outbreaksin 1846 and 1853. He made observations regarding the sanitary conditions of the nation as well as its climate. For his contribution to French diplomacy in Persia he received an officer's cross of the l√©gion d‚Äôhonneur. An anecdote is told of when in 1855 his native assistant mistakenly poured him a glass of tincture of cantharides (also known as Spanish fly) instead of brandy; when Cloquet realized what had happened, he drank another glass after it in order to reduce the length of his suffering.

Treatment options for idiopathic scoliosis are determined in part by the severity of the curvature and skeletal maturity, which together help predict the likelihood of progression. Non-surgical treatment (conservative treatment) should be pro-active with intervention performed early as \\"Best results were obtained in 10-25 degrees scoliosis which is a good indication to start therapy before more structural changes within the spine establish.\\" Treatment options have historically been categorized under the following types: #Observation #Bracing #Specialized physical therapy #Surgery For adults, treatment usually focuses on relieving any pain: #Painkilling medication #Bracing #Exercise #Surgery Treatment for idiopathic scoliosis also depends upon the severity of the curvature, the spine‚Äôs potential for further growth, and the risk that the curvature will progress. Mild scoliosis (less than 30 degrees deviation) has traditionally been treated through observation only. However, the progression of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis has been linked to rapid growth, suggesting that observation alone is inadequate as progression can rapidly occur during the pubertal growth spurt. Another study has further shown that the peak rate of growth during puberty can actually be higher in individuals with scoliosis than those without, further exacerbating the issue of rapid worsening of the scoliosis curves. Moderately severe scoliosis (30‚Äì45 degrees) in a child who is still growing requires bracing. A 2013 study by Weinstein et al. found that rigid bracing significantly reduces worsening of curves in the 20-45 degree range and found that 58% of children receiving \\"observation only\\" progressed to surgical range. Recent guidelines published by the Scientific Society of Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) in 2016 state that ‚Äúthe use of a brace is recommended in patients with evolutive idiopathic scoliosis above 25¬∫ during growth‚Äù based on a review of current scientific literature. Severe curvatures that rapidly progress may be treated surgically with spinal rod placement. Thus, early detection and early intervention prior to the pubertal growth spurt provides the greatest correction and prevention of progression to surgical range. In all cases, early intervention offers the best results. A growing body of scientific research testifies to the efficacy of specialized treatment programs of physical therapy, which may include bracing. Physical therapy Physical therapists and occupational therapists help those who have experienced an injury or illness regain or maintain the ability to participate in everyday activities. For those with scoliosis, a physical therapist and/or occupational therapist can provide assistance through assessment, intervention, and ongoing evaluation of the condition. This helps them manage physical symptoms and/or use compensatory techniques so that they can participate in daily activities like self-care, productivity, and leisure. One intervention involves bracing. During the past several decades, a large variety of bracing devices have been developed for the treatment of scoliosis. Studies demonstrate that preventing force sideways across a joint by bracing prevents further curvature of the spine in idiopathic scoliosis, while other studies have also shown that braces can be used by individuals with scoliosis during physical activities. It is important to note that scoliosis is not merely a lateral or sideways deformity, but occurs in three dimensions as a rotational component is often present. Other interventions include postural strategies, such as posture training in sitting, standing, and sleeping positions, and in using positioning supports such as pillows, wedges, rolls, and corsets. Adaptive and compensatory strategies are also employed to help facilitate individuals to returning daily activities. =Scoliosis Specific Exercises= A spinal muscle exercise performed by lying in the prone position and performing alternating shoulder flexions and hip extensions Scoliosis specific exercised have been found to improve treatment outcomes when utilized in addition to bracing and other standards of care. Scoliosis specific exercises include methods such as Schroth which specifically aim to correct aesthetic differences and strengthened muscles and connective tissue that may have atrophied as a result of scoliosis and asymmetric posture. Schroth exercises and other scoliosis specific exercises should be utilized in conjunction with bracing and other standards of care, and be performed under the guidance of a trained professional to ensure the exercises are effective and target the individual's curve pattern so that the correct muscles are strengthened. Strengthening spinal muscles is a crucial preventive measure. This is because the muscles in the back are essential when it comes to supporting the spinal column and maintaining the spine's proper shape. Exercises that will help improve the strength of the muscles in the back include rows and leg and arm extensions. Elastic resistance exercise may also be able to sustain the progression of spinal curvature. This type of exercise is able to sustain progression by equalizing the strength of the torso muscles found on each side of the body. =Self-care= Disability caused by scoliosis, as well as physical limitations during recovery from treatment- related surgery, often affects an individual‚Äôs ability to perform self-care activities. One of the first treatments of scoliosis is the attempt to prevent further curvature of the spine. Depending on the size of the curvature, this is typically done in one of three ways: bracing, surgery, or postural positioning through customized cushioning. Stopping the progression of the scoliosis can prevent the loss of function in many activities of daily living by maintaining range of motion, preventing deformity of the rib cage, and reducing pain during activities such as bending or lifting. Occupational therapists are often involved in the process of selection and fabrication of customized cushions. These individualized postural supports are used to maintain the current spinal curvature, or they can be adjusted to assist in the correction of the curvature. This type of treatment can help to maintain mobility for a wheelchair user by preventing the deformity of the rib cage and maintaining an active range of motion in the arms. For other self-care activities (such as dressing, bathing, grooming, personal hygiene, and feeding), several strategies can be used as a part of occupational therapy treatment. Environmental adaptations for bathing could include a bath bench, grab bars installed in the shower area, or a handheld shower nozzle. For activities such as dressing and grooming, various assistive devices and strategies can be used to promote independence. An occupational therapist may recommend a long-handled reacher that can be used to assist self-dressing by allowing a person to avoid painful movements such as bending over; a long- handled shoehorn can be used for putting on and removing shoes. Problems with activities such as cutting meat and eating can be addressed by using specialized cutlery, kitchen utensils, or dishes. =Productivity= Productive activities include paid or unpaid work, household chores, school, and play. Recent studies in healthcare have led to the development of a variety of treatments to assist in the management of scoliosis thereby maximizing productivity for people of all ages. Assistive technology has undergone dramatic changes over the past 20 years; the availability and quality of the technology has improved greatly. As a result of using assistive technology, functional changes may range from improvements in abilities, performance in daily activities, participation levels, and quality of life. A common assistive technology intervention is specialized seating and postural control. For children with poor postural control, a comfortable seating system that provides them with the support needed to maintain a sitting position can be essential for raising their overall level of well-being. A child's well- being in a productive sense involves the ability to participate in classroom and play activities. Specialized wheelchair seating has been identified as the most common prescription in the management of scoliosis in teenagers with muscular dystrophy. With comfortable wheelchair seating, teenagers are able to participate in classroom activities for longer periods with less fatigue. By tilting the seating position 20¬∞ forward (toward the thighs), seating pressure is significantly redistributed, so sitting is more comfortable. If an office worker with scoliosis can sit for longer periods, increased work output is likely to occur and could improve quality of life. Tall, forward-sloping seats or front parts of seats, and when possible with tall desk with the opposite slope, can, in general, reduce pains and the need of bending significantly while working or studying, and that is particularly important with braced, fragile, or tender backs. An open hip angle can benefit the used lung volume and respiration. For those not using a wheelchair, bracing may be used to treat scoliosis. Lifestyle changes are made to compensate for the proper use of spine braces. =Leisure= Physical symptoms such as chest pains, back pains, shortness of breath, and limited spinal movement can hamper or preclude participation in leisure activities of a physical nature. The occupational therapist's role is to facilitate participation by helping the patient manage these symptoms. Bracing is a common strategy recommended by an occupational therapist, in particular, for individuals engaging in sports and exercise. An OT is responsible for educating an individual on the advantages and disadvantages of different braces, proper ways to wear the brace, and the day- to-day care of the brace. To help a person manage heart and lung symptoms, such as shortness of breath or chest pains, an occupational therapist can teach the individual energy conservation techniques. This includes scheduling routine breaks during the activity, as suitable for the individual. For example, an occupational therapist can recommend that a swimmer take breaks between laps to conserve energy. Adapting or modifying the exercise or sport is another way a person with scoliosis can do it. Adapting the activity may change the difficulty of the sport or exercise. For example, it might mean taking breaks throughout an exercise. If a person with scoliosis is unable to participate in a sport or exercise, an OT can help the individual explore other physical activities that are suitable to his/her interests and capabilities. An occupational therapist and the person with scoliosis can explore enjoyable and meaningful participation in the sport/exercise in another capacity, such as coaching or refereeing. Bracing Bracing is most effective when the patient has bone growth remaining (is skeletally immature) and should aim to both prevent progression of the curve (prevent progression to surgery), as well as reduce the scoliosis curve. Reduction of the curve is important as the natural history of idiopathic scoliosis suggests it can continue to progress at a rate ~1 degree per year in adulthood, while the treatment results of bracing have been shown to hold over >15 years. In some cases with juveniles, bracing has reduced curves significantly, going from a 40 degrees (of the curve, mentioned in length above.) out of the brace to 18 degrees in it. Braces are sometimes prescribed for adults to relieve pain related to scoliosis. Bracing involves fitting the patient with a device that covers the torso; in some cases, it extends to the neck. The most commonly used brace is a TLSO, such as a Cheneau type brace, a corset-like appliance that fits from armpits to hips and is custom-made from fiberglass or plastic. It is worn upwards of 18‚Äì23 hours a day, depending on the doctor's prescription, and applies pressure on the curves in the spine. The effectiveness of the brace depends not only on brace design and orthotist skill; patient compliance; and amount of wear per day, but also the \\"stiffness\\" of the spine resulting from a shortened spinal cord and/or nerve tension. as evidence by the force necessary (mean force ~121 lbs) to physically correct scoliosis during spinal surgery The typical use of braces for idiopathic scoliosis is to prevent progression to surgical range as well as reduce the scoliotic curve of the spine as spinal fusion surgery can reduce mobility due to fusion of the vertebrate while potentially increasing pain long term. For non-idiopathic scoliosis (ie. neuromuscular, congenital, etc.) and those with additional comorbidities (ie. Marfans Syndrome) spinal surgery may be required due to structural changes in the spine. Indications for Scoliosis Bracing: Scoliosis professionals determine the proper bracing method for a patient after a complete clinical evaluation. The patient‚Äôs growth potential, age, maturity, and scoliosis (Cobb angle, rotation, and sagittal profile) are also considered. Immature patients who present with Cobb angles less than 20 degrees should be closely monitored and proactively treated based on their risk of progression as surgery can be prevented with early intervention of conservative treatment. Immature patients who present with Cobb angles of 20 degrees to 29 degrees should be braced according to the risk of progression by considering age, Cobb angle increase over a six-month period, Risser sign, and clinical presentation. Immature patients who present with Cobb angles greater than 30 degrees should be braced. However, these are guidelines and not every patient will fit into this table. For example, an immature patient with a 17-degree Cobb angle and significant thoracic rotation or flatback could be considered for nighttime bracing. On the opposite end of the growth spectrum, a 29-degree Cobb angle and a Risser sign three or four might not need to be braced because there is reduced potential for progression. Surgery is indicated by the Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) at 45 degrees to 50 degrees and by the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) at a Cobb angle of 45 degrees. adolescents/surgical_treatment.htm. Accessed January 27, 2013 SOSORT uses the 45-degree to 50-degree threshold as a result of the well-documented, plus or minus five degrees measurement error that can occur while measuring Cobb angles. Scoliosis braces are usually comfortable for the patient, especially when it is well designed and fit; also after the 7- to 10-day break-in period. A well fit and functioning scoliosis brace provides comfort when it is supporting the deformity and redirecting the body into a more corrected and normal physiological position. The Scoliosis Research Society's recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25¬∞, curves presenting between 30 and 45¬∞, Risser sign 0, 1, or 2 (an X-ray measurement of a pelvic growth area), and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls. A Ch√™neau brace achieving correction from 56¬∞ to 27¬∞ Cobb angle Progressive scolioses exceeding 25¬∞ Cobb angle in the pubertal growth spurt should be treated with a pattern-specific brace like the Ch√™neau brace and its derivatives, with an average brace-wearing time of 16 hours/day (23 hours/day assures the best possible result). The latest standard of brace construction is with CAD/CAM technology. With the help of this technology, it has been possible to standardize the pattern-specific brace treatment. Severe mistakes in brace construction are largely ruled out with the help of these systems. This technology also eliminates the need to make a plaster cast for brace construction. The measurements can be taken in any place and are simple (and not comparable to plastering). Available CAD/CAM braces include the Regnier-Ch√™neau brace, the Rigo-System-Ch√™neau-brace (RSC brace), the Silicon Valley Brace, and the Gensingen brace; braces can and should be customized to fit the individual's curve pattern and reduce the curve as much as possible as immediate in-brace correction has been shown to be associated with better treatment outcomes.Weiss HR: Best Practice in conservative scoliosis care. Pflaum Company, 3rd. edition, Munich 2010 Many patients prefer the \\"Ch√™neau light\\" brace as it has good in-brace corrections reported in international literature and is easier to wear than other braces in use today. However, this brace is not available for all curve patterns. Prior to 2013 the efficacy of bracing has not been definitively demonstrated in randomised clinical studies, with more limited studies giving inconsistent conclusions. In 2013 the Bracing in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Trial (BrAIST) published results establishing benefits of bracing in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. In the randomized cohort, 72% in the group instructed to wear a brace for 18 hours per day against 48% in the observation group sustained curve progression to under 50 degrees, the proxy used for not requiring surgery. Additionally results suggested that the more a patient wore the brace, the better the result. =Casting= In progressive infantile and sometimes juvenile scoliosis, a plaster jacket applied early may be used instead of a brace. It has been proven possible to permanently correct cases of infantile idiopathic scoliosis by applying a series of plaster casts (EDF: elongation, derotation, flexion) on a specialized frame under corrective traction, which helps to \\"mould\\" the infant's soft bones and work with their growth spurts. This method was pioneered by UK scoliosis specialist Min Mehta. EDF casting is now the only clinically known nonsurgical method of complete correction in progressive infantile scoliosis. Complete correction may be obtained for curves less than 50¬∞ if the treatment begins before the second year of life. Surgery Surgery is usually recommended by orthopedists for curves with a high likelihood of progression (i.e., greater than 45 to 50¬∞ of magnitude), curves that would be cosmetically unacceptable as an adult, curves in patients with spina bifida and cerebral palsy that interfere with sitting and care, and curves that affect physiological functions such as breathing. Surgery for scoliosis is performed by a surgeon specializing in spine surgery. For various reasons, it is usually impossible to completely straighten a scoliotic spine, but in most cases, significant corrections are achieved. The two main types of surgery are: *Anterior fusion: This surgical approach is through an incision at the side of the chest wall. *Posterior fusion: This surgical approach is through an incision on the back and involves the use of metal instrumentation to correct the curve. One or both of these surgical procedures may be needed. The surgery may be done in one or two stages and, on average, takes four to eight hours. A Cochrane review could not draw conclusions on how effective surgical interventions were when compared to non-surgical interventions in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. =Spinal fusion with instrumentation= Spinal fusion is the most widely performed surgery for scoliosis. In this procedure, bone [either harvested from elsewhere in the body (autograft) or from a donor (allograft)] is grafted to the vertebrae so when they heal, they form one solid bone mass and the vertebral column becomes rigid. This prevents worsening of the curve, at the expense of some spinal movement. This can be performed from the anterior (front) aspect of the spine by entering the thoracic or abdominal cavities, or more commonly, performed from the back (posterior). A combination may be used in more severe cases, though the modern pedicle screw system has largely negated the need for this. In recent years all-screw systems have become the gold-standard technique for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Pedicle screws achieve better fixation of the vertebral column and have better biomechanical properties than previous techniques, so enabling greater correction of the curve in all planes. Pedicle screw-only posterior spinal fusion may improve major curve correction at two years among patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) as compared to hybrid instrumentation (proximal hooks with distal pedicle screws) (65% versus 46%) according to a retrospective, matched-cohort study. The prospective cohorts were matched to the retrospective cohorts according to patient age, fusion levels, Lenke curve type, and operative method. The two groups were not significantly different in regard to age, Lenke AIS curve type, or Riser grade. The numbers of fused vertebrae were significantly different (11.7¬±1.6 for pedicle screw versus 13.0¬±1.2 for hybrid group). This study's results may be biased due to the pedicle screw group's being analyzed prospectively versus retrospective analysis of the hybrid instrumentation group. In general, modern spinal fusions have good outcomes with high degrees of correction and low rates of failure and infection. However a systematic review of PubMed papers in 2008 concluded \\"Scoliosis surgery has a varying but high rate of complications\\", although the non-standardised data on complications was difficult to assess and was incomplete. Patients with fused spines and permanent implants tend to have normal lives with unrestricted activities when they are younger; it remains to be seen whether those that have been treated with the newer surgical techniques develop problems as they age.Weill Cornell Neurological Surgery ‚Äì Surgical Services. Cornellneurosurgery.org. Retrieved on 2011-01-16. =Thoracoplasty= A complementary surgical procedure a surgeon may recommend is called thoracoplasty (also called costoplasty). This is a procedure to reduce the rib hump that affects most scoliosis patients with a thoracic curve. A rib hump is evidence of some rotational deformity to the spine. Thoracoplasty may also be performed to obtain bone grafts from the ribs instead of the pelvis, regardless of whether a rib hump is present. Thoracoplasty can be performed as part of a spinal fusion or as a separate surgery, entirely. Thoracoplasty is the removal (or resection) of typically four to six segments of adjacent ribs that protrude. Each segment is one to two inches long. The surgeon decides which ribs to resect based on either their prominence or their likelihood to be realigned by correction of the curvature alone. The ribs grow back straight. Thoracoplasty has risks, such as increased pain in the rib area during recovery or reduced pulmonary function (10‚Äì15% is typical) following surgery. This impairment can last anywhere from a few months to two years. Because thoracoplasty may lengthen the duration of surgery, patients may also lose more blood or develop complications from the prolonged anesthesia. A more significant, though far less common, risk is the surgeon might inadvertently puncture the pleura, a protective coating over the lungs. This could cause blood or air to drain into the chest cavity, hemothorax or pneumothorax, respectively. =Surgery without fusion for growing children= Implants that aim to delay spinal fusion and to allow more spinal growth in young children is the gold standard for surgical treatment of early onset scoliosis. Surgery without fusion can be divided into three principles: distraction of the entire spine, compression of the short segment of spine, and guided-growth techniques. Distraction-based systems include Vertical, Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Ribs (VEPTR) & growing rods.The concept uses distraction to create additional soft-tissue space in-between the vertebrae, for the bone to later grow into. Its universal application was thrusted through the use of traditional growth rods which required repeated invasive surgeries every 6-12 months for the sustenance of growth, via distraction. Nowadays developed countries only use MAGEC (MAGnetic Expansion Control) rods to non-invasively lengthen the spine. In contrast, developing and under-developed countries still use traditional growing rods, which require invasive surgery every 6-12 months, because of high initial cost associated with procurement of MAGEC rods. Compression-based system include tethering using a flexible rope-like implant and are relatively new to receive FDA approval. Guided-growth technique include SHILLA (named after a hotel in Korea, where the concept was initiated). SHILLA has the advantage of being one-time surgery and is technologically less demanding compared with MAGEC rod. However, there are still two major disadvantages of using SHILLA: loss of correction and need for osteotomies. The failure of most of these standalone techniques has shown that the concept of ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù is not applicable for the surgical management of EOS. Therefore, newer concepts employing two or more of the above philosophies, i.e. various combinations of distraction- based, guided-growth, and compression-based approaches might be more suitable and biomechanically-speaking, a more optimal surgical intervention. One such combination currently used for surgery includes active apex correction (APC). It is a hybrid of guided-growth and compression-based management of deformity. The technique simply consists of replacing the apical fusion (of traditional SHILLA) with unilateral compression (via pedicle screws or any other means) on the convex side. The latest clinical results presented by spine researchers Aakash Agarwal and Alaaedldin Azmi Ahmad on APC shows good clinical results with no economic barrier to use the technology. =Complications= The risk of undergoing surgery for scoliosis was estimated in 2008 to be varying, but with a high rate of complications. Possible complications may be inflammation of the soft tissue or deep inflammatory processes, breathing impairments, bleeding and nerve injuries. It is not yet clear what to expect from spine surgery in the long term. Taking into account that signs and symptoms of spinal deformity cannot be changed by surgical intervention, surgery remains primarily a cosmetic indication, only especially in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, the most common form of scoliosis never exceeding 80¬∞. However, the cosmetic effects of surgery are not necessarily stable. For spinal fusion surgery on AIS cases, with instrumentation attached using pedicle screws, complication rates were reported in 2011 as transient neurological injuries between 0% to 1.5%, a pedicle fracture rate of 0.24%, screw malposition assessed by radiography at 1.5%, 6% when assessed by CT scans though these patients were asymptomatic not requiring screw revision, and screw loosening noted in 0.76% of patients. For surgery without fusion in growing children, substantial percentage of patients undergoing SHILLA technique experience loss of correction via crankshafting or adding-on (eg, distal migration). In addition, the need for osteotomies on the concave side has the potential of severe complications. For MAGEC rods, higher distraction magnitude resulted in the generation of higher distraction forces, and this in combination with off-axis loading (exemplified by ‚Äúgrowth marks‚Äù) result in wear and breakage of MAGEC rod‚Äôs components. =After-surgery care= Pain medication In the event of surgery to correct scoliosis, pain medications and anesthesia will be administered. Before the surgery, the patient will receive anesthesia. With adults, the anesthesia will be administered through an IV in the antecubital region of the arm. With young children, however, the child will be asked to breathe in nitrous oxide, or laughing gas. Because needles can be frightening for a young child, the nitrous oxide will put them to sleep so the anesthesiologist can then insert the IV in order to give them the anesthesia. After the surgery, the patient will most likely be given morphine. Until the patient is ready to take the medicine by mouth, an IV will be giving them their medication. Morphine is the most common pain medicine used after scoliosis surgery, and is often administered through a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) system. The PCA system allows the patient to push a button when they are feeling pain, and the PCA will emit the drugs into the IV and then into the body. To prevent overdoses, there is a limit on the number of times a patient can push the button. If a patient pushes the button too much at once, the PCA will reject the request. Bowel and bladder function For the patient's bladder control, a catheter will be inserted so that a patient can urinate without having to move. A catheter is inserted because the patient will not have much free movement to be able to get up and walk to the bathroom. The most common type of catheter used after major surgeries is an indwelling Foley catheter. The indwelling Foley catheter is most often put in the urethra, with a tube leading into a drainage bag. Once the catheter is inserted into the urethra, a balloon is blown up inside the bladder in order to keep it from falling out. The balloon allows the catheter to remain inside the urethra until the patient is able to get up and go to the bathroom on their own. The drainage bag is connected to the side of the bed, and must be changed or emptied out once it is full. Bowel control can vary from patient to patient. The combination of no food, very little fluids, and a lot of prescription drugs has the potential to cause many patients to become constipated. The body is used to a normal diet, and used to excreting waste in a system. Interrupting the system can cause bowel problems. This constipation can be resolved in a couple of ways. The first way, and the most common way, is to administer a rectal suppository. A rectal suppository is administered through the anus, and into the rectum. They are bullet-shaped and contain medicine that will help the patient's bowels get back on track. Once the suppository is inserted, it is designed to melt off the wax-like case, and put the medicine in the body. If the suppository does not work, a laxative may be continued at home to keep the bowels in full function. Diet When first returning home after surgery, a nutritional diet is necessary in order to keep the body operating correctly. Junk food is not a good idea, as the grease and sugar can irregulate the bowels. Fruit, vegetables, and juices will be a vital part in the diet. Food and drink will be limited for the patient after surgery. Because the bowels are not fully active because of anesthetic, clear water and ice may be the only acceptable thing to ingest. After the digestive tract is back up to speed, soft food and drink like pudding, soup broth, and orange juice are acceptable. Very dark urine with a strong odor means that the person is most likely dehydrated and needs more fluids. In order for the urine to become a pale or clear color, the patient will need to drink a lot of water. Juices such as prune juice are a healthy option and prune juice also helps with constipation, a common factor after surgery. When it comes to food, whole grains should be added into the diet. Whole grains can be broken down easily by the body whereas processed grains and flour cannot be broken down easily. Processed grains and flour also add to constipation. History In 1962, Paul Harrington introduced a metal spinal system of instrumentation that assisted with straightening the spine, as well as holding it rigid while fusion took place. The original (now obsolete) Harrington rod operated on a ratchet system, attached by hooks to the spine at the top and bottom of the curvature that when cranked would distract, or straighten, the curve. The Harrington rod represented a major advance in the field, as it obviated the need for prolonged casting, allowing patients greater mobility in the postoperative period and significantly reducing the quality of life burden of fusion surgery. Additionally, as the first system to apply instrumentation directly to the spine, the Harrington rod was the precursor to most modern spinal instrumentation systems. A major shortcoming of the Harrington method was it failed to produce a posture wherein the skull would be in proper alignment with the pelvis, and it did not address rotational deformity. As a result, unfused parts of the spine would try to compensate for this in the effort to stand up straight. As the person aged, there would be increased wear and tear, early-onset arthritis, disc degeneration, muscular stiffness, and pain with eventual reliance on painkillers, further surgery, inability to work full-time, and disability. \\"Flatback\\" became the medical name for a related complication, especially for those who had lumbar scoliosis.Scoliosis Surgery. News-medical.net. Retrieved on 2011-01-16. In the 1960s, the gold standard for idiopathic scoliosis was a posterior approach using a single Harrington rod. Post-operative recovery involved bed rest, casts, and braces. Poor results became apparent over time. In the 1970s, an improved technique was developed using two rods and wires attached at each level of the spine. This segmented instrumentation system allowed patients to become mobile soon after surgery. In the 1980s, Cotrel- Dubousset instrumentation improved fixation and addressed sagittal imbalance and rotational defects unresolved by the Harrington rod system. This technique used multiple hooks with rods to give stronger fixation in three dimensions, usually eliminating the need for post-operative bracing.

These measurements will complement at low frequency and correct from galactic contamination those obtained by the Planck satellite from 2009 to 2013. The two QUIJOTE telescopes are placed at the Teide Observatory, run by the Spanish Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias (IAC). Both telescopes were produced by the IDOM company in Spain. Overview The primordial matter density fluctuations that originated the present structure of the universe left imprinted spatial variations in the CMB radiation. From high sensitivity maps of this radiation, QUIJOTE aims to constrain the most relevant cosmological parameters: total energy/matter density, density of cold dark matter, density of baryonic matter, the Hubble constant, density of dark energy, neutrino density, and the reionization epoch. The first QUIJOTE-CMB telescope (QT1), in operation since November 2012, has two instruments which can be exchanged in the QT1 focal plane. The first instrument (MFI) is a multichannel instrument providing the frequency coverage between 10 and 20 GHz. The second instrument (TGI) consists of 31 polarimeters working at 30 GHz. The second QUIJOTE-CMB telescope (QT2), in operation since 2014,QUIJOTE CMB Experiment: Telescope & Enclosure.

It is a high- affinity, selective ligand of the androgen receptor (AR) (Ki = 2.1‚Äì4.9 nM), where it acts as a full agonist in vitro, and has in vitro potency comparable to that of testosterone. However, in vivo, acetothiolutamide displayed overall negligible androgenic effects, though significant (albeit very low) anabolic effects were observed at high doses. In addition, notable antiandrogen effects were observed in castrated male rats treated with testosterone propionate. The discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo actions of acetothiolutamide was determined to be related to rapid plasma clearance and extensive hepatic metabolism into a variety of metabolites with differing pharmacological activity, including AR partial agonism and antagonism. In accordance with its poor metabolic stability, acetothiolutamide is not orally bioavailable, and shows activity only via injected routes such as subcutaneous and intravenous.

He is best known for his film debut as the high-kicking henchman in the final fight of Jackie Chan's Who Am I? in 1998. He currently lives in Thailand, where he works as an actor, stuntman, and fight choreographer. Early life Born in Nieuwegein on 30 April 1974, Ron began his martial arts training at the age of seven, beginning with Judo and four years later, transitioned to Karate and Free Fighting, a form of Mixed Martial Arts. He admits he was influenced by the likes of Jackie Chan and Hwang In-Shik as well as Jean- Claude Van Damme. During this time, he was doing demonstrations, some appearing on television\\"Kung Fu Kingdom: Interview with Ron Smoorenburg\\", Kung Fu Kingdom, 11 August 2013. and then it was in 1997, live on a local television program, Smoorenburg gained the record for the highest kick of 11 feet\\"The Ron Smoorenburg Story\\", Retrieved 11 August 2016. Film career When Jackie Chan was filming Who Am I? in Rotterdam in 1997, Smoorenburg auditioned for a role in the film. Impressed with his kicking skills, Chan hired him to play one of two final opponents in which Chan would film the fight on the roof of the Willemswerf Building. It is here where Ron learned how to work in a fight scene for the first time and had some trouble adapting to Chan's trademark rhythmic movements. However, he eventually learned the pacing but for more complicated movements of the fights were doubled by Jackie Chan Stunt Team members Brad Allan, Andy Cheng, and Nicky Li. In 1999, Smoorenburg appeared as a top villain on an episode of the short-lived action series Der Puma: Kampfer mit Herz, taking on the series' lead star, Mickey Hardt, with Donnie Yen serving as action director. The experience was a good one for Smoorenburg and he would take on a few bit parts in Hong Kong movies. He played a cage fighter in Gen-Y Cops having a short fight scene against Stephen Fung. The two would have a longer rematch with Smoorenburg playing a character resembling Bryan Fury against Fung's Iron Surfer, who resembled Hwoarang in the Tekken-inspired film The Avenging Fist in 2001. Smoorenburg would play another fighter in Born Wild opposite Louis Koo and moved up to play the main villain in Martial Angels opposite Shu Qi. With learning the ropes in Hong Kong, Smoorenburg returned home to the Netherlands in 2002, where he began to craft his skills as a fight choreographer and actor. He appeared in the 2002 Belgian horror film Engine Trouble for director Marc Ickx and in 2004, co-starred and choreographed Fighting Fish, the Netherlands' first full-length martial arts film, starring Chinese-born Kim Ho-Kim. In 2005, Smoorenburg went to Thailand to work as a stunt fighter on Tom-Yum- Goong, where he is seen as one of many fighters in a one vs. many fight against Tony Jaa. Ron loved the experience and locales so much that he decided to move there. Since then, Smoorenburg has appeared in both film and television series in Thailand, where he has a chance to showcase his action style. He has become good friends with the likes of Swedish-Chinese born stunt ace Tim Man and French-born stunt ace Brahim Achabbakhe. He can be seen taking on Scott Adkins in Ninja: Shadow of a Tear and teams up with Achabbakhe to take on Kane Kosugi in the sequel Tekken 2: Kazuya's Revenge. In 2016, Smoorenburg had a bit role as a fighter who takes on Michael Jai White in the opening of Never Back Down: No Surrender and will be seen as the heroic Black Knight in Warrior's Gate opposite Dave Bautista.

History The OIWUS was founded by Colonel B.J.D. Irwin at Fort Sheridan near Chicago. It was patterned after other American military societies such as the Society of the Cincinnati, the Aztec Club of 1847 and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Its primary purpose is to provide fellowship to is members and preserve the history of the Indian Wars. The correct name of the OIWUS is the \\"Order of Indian Wars,\\" not \\"Order of THE Indian Wars.\\" The latter name belongs to a Colorado-based group of Indian wars enthusiasts. Earlier references here to the \\"Order of the Indian Wars\\" are incorrect. Objects According to its constitution the objects of the OIWUS are to ... perpetuate the memories of the services rendered by the military forces of the United States in their conflicts and wars against hostile Indians within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States, and to collect and secure for publication historical data relating to the instances of heroic service and personal devotion by which Indian warfare has been illustrated. Membership Membership originally consisted of veteran officers (termed Original Companions) and their male descendants (termed Hereditary Companions). Over the first fifty years of the Order's existence its membership included 300 Original Companions, 275 Hereditary Companions and 75 Junior Companions. In time, the Original Companions died out and the only members were hereditary companions. More recently, membership was expanded to include descendants of soldiers who served in wars with Native Americans dating back to the early 1600s. Currently, Hereditary Companions can be either (1) the direct lineal or collateral descendants of Original Companions of the Order, or (2) Commissioned Officers of the United States Armed Forces, who are direct lineal descendants of honorably discharged enlisted men who had the qualifications requisite for eligibility for membership as Original Companions, save that of having been commissioned. Membership may also be considered for gentlemen who are lineally descended from persons, of any rank, who engaged in combat against Native Americans serving in a military unit under the British Crown, prior to June 14, 1776.

Biography  Rosario Illescas S√°nchez was born in M√°laga on 16 August 1879 in the neighborhood of Victoria. She began her career at the Teatro Vital Aza M√°laga from an early age. At 16, she moved to Madrid to perform in small theaters and debuted at the Pr√≠ncipe Alfonso in 1896. The same year, she traveled to Mexico and triumphed in the Teatro Principal with La marcha de C√°diz, where she got the nickname La Patita. After passing through Havana, Cuba in 1901 at the Payret Teatro, she left for Milan, Italy to study singing. She returned to Spain in 1903, where she began her stage career performing at Tivoli, el Eslava, Novedades, Vital Aza and Teatro de la Zarzuela highlighting interpretations of Mozo Cr√∫o and La Revoltosa, among others. In 1907, at the Apollo, she performed the zarzuela, \\"Las Bribonas\\". In 1910, a few months before ending her season at the Apollo, she resigned and left the Gran Teatro. In September of the same year, she moved to Mexico, premiering two works by the Calleja. Soler was styled \\"La Patita\\" because of the song she sings in La Marcha de Cadiz. She was described by the Spanish adjective ‚Äúsimpatica,‚Äù and the English word ‚Äúmagnetic.‚Äù She possessed a delicate beauty and charm, and a voice of light timbre, which, while very pleasant, gave a suggestion of an imperfect training. She sang chula (pretty, but of the people) parts, and all other parts she invested with her personality. Her impersonation in ‚ÄúLa Viejecita‚Äù of a rollicking young officer, who, spurned and jeered by his fellows for not having received an invitation to a ball, masquerades as a demure little old lady to gain admission to the house, and wooes, and wins the hand of a count's daughter. The intensity, dash and delicacy of her acting, together with her rendering of the music, to which her voice is particularly fitted, were entertaining. With Los Cocineros, Soler is most closely identified. The final waltz-song which she sang, accompanied by a chorus costumed as cooks and beating time on skillets, was widely popular throughout the Mexico City. After ten years between Mexico, New York City, and Havana, she returned to Madrid in 1923 with a masterful interpretation of the operetta El ni√±o jud√≠o in the Price theater. She retired in Nice, France. In 1931, she returned to M√°laga and died there on November 22, 1944.  References   Rosario Soler. Una zarzuela en cuadros disolventes. Roberto Carril Bustamante.

After a tweet reputedly mocking the white genocide conspiracy theory and a tweet expressing support for the 1804 Haiti Massacre, as well as other statements, Ciccariello-Maher was placed on administrative leave and later resigned from Drexel. He claimed this was due to \\"death threats and threats of violence.\\" Academic career Ciccariello-Maher did his undergraduate work at St. Lawrence University and Cambridge University, where he was a Davies-Jackson Scholar. He then completed a master's degree at University of California, Berkeley before taking a sabbatical in Mexico. After returning he finished a Ph.D in political science from Berkeley in 2010, and was then appointed as assistant professor of politics and global studies at Drexel University in Philadelphia the same year. He was promoted to associate professor in 2016. He is the author of three books. Ciccariello-Maher's first book, We Created Chavez: A People's History of the Venezuelan Revolution, concerns Hugo Chavez's Bolivarian Revolution. In a review for the academic journal Latin American Politics and Society, assistant professor Erica S. Simmons of the University of Wisconsin said, \\"Ciccariello-Maher offers valuable insight into what the coming years may bring.\\" He has translated books by Enrique Dussel, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Stefan Gandler, and is co- editor (with Bruno Bosteels) of the book series \\"Radical Am√©ricas,\\" published by Duke University Press. He is a member of the editorial collective of Abolition: A Journal of Insurgent Politics. Ciccariello-Maher has served as a media commentator on Venezuela's Bolivarian Revolution, the role of white supremacy in the killings of Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Freddie Gray and Philando Castile, the Ferguson unrest and 2015 Baltimore protests, and the abolition of the police. In October 2017, he became the subject of controversy after tweeting \\"All I Want for Christmas is White Genocide and \\"To clarify: when the whites were massacred during the Haitian Revolution, that was a good thing indeed\\". Following this, Drexel University placed Ciccariello-Maher on administrative leave. On December 28, Ciccariello-Maher announced his resignation from Drexel, effective December 31, citing \\"nearly a year of harassment by right-wing, white supremacist media outlets and Internet mobs, after death threats and threats of violence directed against me and my family.\\" In January 2018, Cicarriello-Maher announced on Facebook that he was now a visiting scholar at New York University's Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics. Activism While in England, Ciccariello-Maher was a member of the Cambridge collective Anti-Capitalist Action, and was later arrested during the 20 March 2003 anti-war protest known as \\"Day X\\" that marked the beginning of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. When four members were rusticated from King's College, Cambridge in 2002 for their participation in a squatted social center, Ciccariello-Maher co-authored an appeal document that resulted in their reinstatement. Ciccariello-Maher was a member of Bring the Ruckus, co-founded by the late Joel Olson. In Oakland, he was arrested for involvement in the protests that followed the shooting death of Oscar Grant by transit officer Johannes Mehserle. Ciccariello-Maher supports Venezuela's Bolivarian Revolution. During opposition protests in early 2014, he appeared on Democracy Now to discuss his views of protesters' support for opposition leaders like Leopoldo L√≥pez. He has also been critical of those on the left and anarchists who have supported the Venezuelan opposition during those protests. =Social media controversies= Ciccariello-Maher was active on social media, where his statements have created controversy, including calls for his dismissal. His writing in Salon that \\"Riots Work\\" claims that racism against white people is imaginary and that the police should be abolished. In 2015, he tweeted that a South Carolina school police officer, who lost his job after body-slamming a black female student during an arrest, should be done \\"like Old Yeller.\\" On Christmas Eve 2016, Ciccariello-Maher tweeted, \\"All I Want for Christmas is White Genocide.\\" Ciccariello-Maher stated the tweet was sent in response to a racist backlash against State Farm Insurance for purportedly advancing \\"white genocide\\" by depicting an interracial couple in an advertisement. On Christmas Day, Drexel issued a public statement distancing itself from Ciccariello-Maher's tweet: Ciccariello-Maher responded by stating that \\"white genocide\\" is an \\"imaginary concept... invented by white supremacists,\\" adding that \\"It is a figment of the racist imagination, it should be mocked, and I'm glad to have mocked it.\\" He criticized Drexel's response, which \\"amounts to caving to the truly reprehensible movements and organizations that I was critiquing... White supremacy is on the rise, and we must fight it by any means. In that fight, universities will need to choose whether they are on the side of free expression and academic debate, or on the side of the racist mob.\\" Some critics dismissed the Drexel statement as a misinterpretation of the tweet, and for infringing on Ciccariello-Maher's academic freedom and due process. Hank Reichman, chair of the American Association of University Professors Committee on Academic Freedom, suggested that \\"Drexel should apologize to Professor Cicciariello-Maher.\\" Theodore Kupfer, managing editor of the National Review, criticized Ciccariello-Maher, calling him hypocritical due to statements made by him regarding people who also have made controversial statements, but are on the political right. He also cited his support for former President Hugo Ch√°vez and current President Nicol√°s Maduro of Venezuela, who have been accused for violating the free speech of political opponents and the use of physical force against them. In March 2017, Ciccariello-Maher was again criticized for tweeting that he was \\"trying not to vomit or yell about Mosul\\" when a soldier was given a seat by a passenger in first class, on a flight he was on two days after the U.S. bombing of Mosul killed 200 civilians. Drexel's provost M. Brian Blake began an investigation into Ciccariello-Maher's communication on Twitter in April 2017. Shortly after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Ciccariello-Maher posted tweets saying the mass shooting in Las Vegas, which left 59 people dead and hundreds injured, was the product of a system that favors white males. His statements, such as \\"It's the white supremacist patriarchy, stupid\\", resulted in a number of death threats. Subsequently, he wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post in which he elaborated on his tweets, stating \\"I tweeted before then diagnosing a sense of double entitlement‚Äîas white people and as men‚Äîthat, when frustrated, can occasionally lead to violent consequences.\\" Books * Spanish translation: Nosotros creamos a Ch√°vez: Una historia popular de la revoluci√≥n venezolana.

The drug acts as a high- affinity full agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) (Ki = 17 nM), with a potency and efficacy that is said to be equivalent to that of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Unlike testosterone, but similarly to DHT, LG121071 and other nonsteroidal androgens cannot be potentiated by 5Œ±-reductase in androgenic tissues (nor aromatized into estrogenic metabolites), and for this reason, show tissue-selective androgenic effects.
