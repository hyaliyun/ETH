He was considered one of the network's top negotiators, often heading complicated negotiations between NBC and producers, actors and television studios. Agoglia was instrumental in the decision to replace Johnny Carson, the departing host of The Tonight Show, with Jay Leno in 1992. Agoglia was born in Brooklyn, New York. His career began at Barclays Bank, before switching to the television industry. He worked as an executive at CBS for sixteen years before joining rival NBC in 1980. Agoglia moved to southern California permanently when he took the position at NBC. Agoglia worked directly under a string of well-known Presidents of NBC Entertainment and other executives, including Brandon Tartikoff, Warren Littlefield and Don Ohlmeyer. He earned a reputation as one of the network's toughest dealmakers. Agoglia led the often drawn-out negotiations with outside television studios and on-air talent. For example, Agoglia hammered out a deal with Paramount Studios for the renewal of Cheers. He also negotiated the agreement to retain three cast members of Seinfeld - Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Michael Richards - when each actor was demanding one million dollars per episode at the peak of the show's popularity. Agoglia played a significant role in the decision by NBC to name Jay Leno as the host of The Tonight Show over David Letterman in 1992. The move sparked controversy, as Letterman jumped to CBS after Leno's appointment. Agoglia's role in choosing Leno as Johnny Carson's successor was noted in the 1994 book, The Late Shift, by New York Times journalist, Bill Carter. An HBO film adaptation of the book, The Late Shift, aired in 1996. Agoglia was portrayed by actor Reni Santoni in the film. Agoglia led a multi-network 1993 boycott of the Emmy Awards, following a decision by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to air the awards exclusively on ABC. The Emmys had previously broadcast on the television networks on a rotating basis. Agoglia denounced the exclusivity agreement between ABC and the Emmys as \\"bizarre at best\\" and retaliated by boycott all Academy events, including the Primetime Emmy Awards. The Academy and the Emmys, under pressure from Agoglia's boycott, eventually relented and cancelled the deal with ABC. The Emmys returned to the previous agreement, in which the award show was broadcast on each of the four broadcast networks on a rotating basic each year. Agoglia rejoined the executive committee of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in 1994 after the deal with ABC was ended. On June 17, 1997, Agoglia announced his decision to retire from NBC. He left NBC in 1998 after eighteen years with the network. During his retirement Agoglia launched a Media Consulting firm; served as President of the Board of LAX Airport Commission; Served on board of directors of KCET Los Angeles; and was board chairman of the Los Angeles Universal Preschool Program. John Agoglia died on March 14, 2014, at the age of 76 following a three-year illness with cancer. He was survived by his sons, Anthony and John Steven, three grandchildren, and his brother, Thomas Agoglia. His wife, Joanne Agoglia, died in 2010.

The option \\"Encrypt All Sites Eligible\\" makes it possible to block and unblock all non-HTTPS browser connections with one click.HTTPS Everywhere Changelog Development HTTPS Everywhere was inspired by Google's increased use of HTTPS and is designed to force the usage of HTTPS automatically whenever possible. The code, in part, is based on NoScript's HTTP Strict Transport Security implementation, but HTTPS Everywhere is intended to be simpler to use than NoScript's force HTTPS functionality which requires the user to manually add websites to a list. The EFF provides information for users on how to add HTTPS rulesets to HTTPS Everywhere, and information on which websites support HTTPS. =Platform support= A public beta of HTTPS Everywhere for Firefox was released in 2010, and version 1.0 was released in 2011. A beta for Chrome was released in February 2012. In 2014, a version was released for Android phones.  SSL Observatory  The SSL Observatory is a feature in HTTPS Everywhere introduced in version 2.0.1 which analyzes public key certificates to determine if certificate authorities have been compromised, and if the user is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. In 2013, the ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) noted that the data set used by the SSL Observatory often treated intermediate authorities as different entities, thus inflating the number of certificate authorities. The SSAC criticized SSL Observatory for potentially significantly undercounting internal name certificates, and noted that it used a data set from 2010.  Continual Ruleset Updates  The update to Version 2018.4.3, shipped 3 April 2018, introduces the \\"Continual Ruleset Updates\\" function. To apply up-to-date https-rules, this update function executes one rule-matching within 24 hours. A website called https://www.https-rulesets.org/ was built by the EFF for this purpose. This automated update function can be disabled in the add-on settings. Prior the update- mechanism there have been ruleset-updates only through app-updates. Even after this feature was implemented there are still bundled rulesets shipped within app-updates.  Reception  Two studies have recommended building in HTTPS Everywhere functionality into Android browsers. In 2012, Eric Phetteplace described it as \\"perhaps the best response to Firesheep-style attacks available for any platform\\".Kern, M. Kathleen, and Eric Phetteplace. \\"Hardening the browser.\\" Reference & User Services Quarterly 51.3 (2012): 210-214. http://eprints.rclis.org/16837/ In 2011, Vincent Toubiana and Vincent Verdot pointed out some drawbacks of the HTTPS Everywhere add-on, including that the list of services which support HTTPS needs maintaining, and that some services are redirected to HTTPS even though they are not yet available in HTTPS, not allowing the user of the extension to get to the service. Other criticisms are that users may be misled to believe that if HTTPS Everywhere does not switch a site to HTTPS, it is because it does not have an HTTPS version, while it could be that the site manager has not submitted an HTTPS ruleset to the EFF.Time to stop recommending HTTPS Everywhere? Besides, the connection to the SSL Observatory could be used to track the sites that the user visits.

He served as brigade commander for much of the war but his highest actual substantive grade was colonel. His March 2, 1865 nomination for appointment as brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from March 2, 1865, was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 9, 1865. His January 13, 1866 nomination for appointment as a brevet major general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on March 12, 1866.

Root was a commission merchant before the Civil War.  American Civil War  Root enlisted in the Union Army at the beginning of the war and, on May 20, 1861, he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 21st New York Volunteer Infantry, nicknamed the \\"1st Buffalo Regiment\\" because it was the first regiment mustered into the Union Army from Buffalo, New York.Sifakis, Stewart. Who Was Who in the Civil War. New York: Facts On File, 1988. . p. 553. The 21st New York Infantry Regiment served in northern Virginia but engaged in no major actions during Root's service with that regiment. On May 2, 1862, Root was commissioned colonel of the 94th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Root fought with his regiment at the Battle of Cedar Mountain on August 9, 1862, and fought and was wounded at the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 30, 1862. On November 15, 1862, he returned to duty to command the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, I Corps of the Army of the Potomac until May 11, 1863, when he resumed command of his regiment. As brigade commander, he commanded the brigade at the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Battle of Chancellorsville. Root returned to command the brigade on July 1, 1863, the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg, after two other brigade commanders were wounded. Root also was soon wounded and captured. He was exchanged at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1864. Thereafter he was appointed commander of Camp Parole at Annapolis. On March 2, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Root for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 2, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 9, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 756.  Post-war  After the close of hostilities, from May 13, 1865, to June 23, 1865, Root commanded the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, V Corps of the Army of the Potomac. Root was mustered out of the U.S. volunteers on July 18, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Root for appointment to the grade of brevet major general of volunteers, for faithful and meritorious service during the war, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U. S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 714. After the war, Root was a warehouse executive and newspaper editor at Buffalo, New York. Adrian R. Root died at Buffalo, New York, on June 4, 1899. He is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo, New York. Notes References * Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands.

The survey polls America's top business economists, collecting their forecasts of U.S. economic growth, inflation, interest rates, and a host of other critical indicators of future business activity. It has a sister publication called Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, which surveys forecasts of the future direction and level of U.S. interest rates. History Blue Chip Economic Indicators started in 1976. Variables reported The Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey provides forecasts for this year and next from each panel member, plus and average, or consensus, of their forecasts for each of these variables associated with the economy of the United States: * Real GDP * GDP price index * Nominal GDP * Consumer price index * Industrial production * Real disposable personal income * Real personal consumption expenditures * Real non-residential fixed investment * Pre-tax corporate profits * 3-month Treasury bill rate * 10-year Treasury note yield * Unemployment rate * Total housing starts * Auto and light truck sales * Real Net exports Reception =Academic reception= Many papers in the academic literature on the accuracy of macroeconomic forecasts have used the Blue Chip Economic Indicators for a data set of forecasts whose accuracy is to be evaluated. A paper by Laster, Bennett, and Geoum (1999) made a theoretical argument for how rational forecasters with identical information and incentives may still come up with divergent forecasts to maximize their probability of winning, and used the Blue chip Economic Indicators data to provide evidence supportive of their model. The paper noted: \\"The publisher of Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a monthly newsletter compiling dozens of professional economic forecasts, holds an annual dinner at which the most accurate forecaster for the previous year is honored. The winning forecaster is also identified in later issues of the newsletter.\\" The Congressional Budget Office has also cited Blue Chip Economic Indicators data in some of its publications. =Reception in the financial press and blogs= The results of the Blue Chip Economic Indicators have also been used to inform discussion in the financial press and blogs, including Forbes and Barron's. In March 2009, PolitiFact reported that a controversial statement made by Christina Romer based on Blue Chip Economic Indicators data had correctly cited the Blue Chip Economic Indicators.

In this episode, Ariel pleads with Hook to search for Eric, whom she believes disappeared upon his return to Storybrooke, as Emma Swan receives a lesson on how to defeat Zelena from Regina, meanwhile, Mary Margaret and David try to convince Henry that they are not as boring as Henry thinks. Meanwhile, back in the Enchanted Forest, Ariel believes that Hook kidnapped Eric, but when Hook's ship disappears, the two start their search to find out what happened. Plot =Opening Sequence= David's pickup truck is featured driving in the forest. =In the Characters' Past= In the Enchanted Forest, a knight stands in the road blocking two other knights from passing and demands that they leave the treasure. The knights do not take him seriously but all of a sudden, flaming arrows light up all around the 2 knights and they retreat. It turns out that the knight who orchestrated this ambush is Hook, with help from Smee and two of his crew members, and all the flaming arrows were held by dummies. As they arrive to a tavern to celebrate their latest steal, Hook's men get him a bar girl, but outside he, not interested, gives her money and leaves. He gets knocked out by Ariel, who then orders Hook to his feet and he tells her she's got the wrong pirate. Ariel tells Hook that Eric was taken aboard the Jolly Roger, and when Hook asks her who's the captain of his ship now, Ariel shows Hook a knife with carved initials, which Hook recognizes as those belonging to a pirate named Blackbeard. Hook laments that he hasn't been the same since he got back to the Enchanted Forest because he hasn't used his ship. However, Hook is left with no choice but to have Ariel come along with him and Smee. As they trek across the forest, Hook tells Ariel that she may not find Eric, but she tells him she's heard stories of Hook helping Snow White reunite with her family in Neverland, and she says there's nothing wrong with being good, but Hook says (reluctantly) he's a pirate and that he always will be one. As they reach the docks next to the Jolly Roger, Hook sees one of Blackbeard's men and knocks him out, when all of a sudden his adversary Blackbeard shows up to give him a message: if Hook wants his ship, he'll have to fight for it. Hook accepts and a sword fight battle commences, but just as Hook is about to kill Blackbeard, Ariel tells Hook they need to know where Eric is first, because he's not on board. It turns out that Blackbeard has left Eric stranded on a deserted island, and offers Hook a deal in which he'll tell him where Eric is if Hook gives up the Jolly Roger, or else Eric will die. Ariel tries to talk Hook into saving Eric and giving up the Jolly Roger, but he tells her love brings pain and that he's doing her a favour. As Hook cuts Blackbeard loose and tosses him overboard, Ariel slaps Hook and tells him he's selfish and heartless, and that's what will bring him endless torment. Then she jumps off the plank into the water to find Eric, changing back into a mermaid as she swims off. =In Storybrooke= In David and Mary Margaret's loft, Emma Swan helps David put a crib together, and Regina puts a protection spell over the loft to block out Zelena. Emma tells Regina she wants her to teach her magic so they can defeat Zelena. David then offers to watch Henry, but Emma says Henry doesn't think they're fun, as he thinks Hook is better to be around with. At the docks, a homesick Smee tells Hook he and the men miss him, but when he asks Hook what happened to the Jolly Roger, Hook tells him all he needs to know is the ship's not here and has no intention of leaving Storybrooke. As Emma walks up with Henry, Hook flirts with Emma and tells her he thinks it's good she's going to be learning about magic, which she says will be enough to defeat Zelena, then she's done, but Hook tells her she can't pretend this never happened since she can't go back to her old life, saying it didn't work for him. At the same time, Mary Margaret and David walk on the beach and notice a group gathered around a woman who just washed up on shore, which they discover is Ariel. When Mary Margaret and David ask Ariel what happened to her, she tells them that Eric is missing and she's been looking for him, adding that she also has no memories of the missing year. David suggests that Hook might know what happened to Eric. Later on at Granny's diner, Hook teaches Henry how to roll dice, when David comes in and \\"introduces\\" Ariel to him, but when she asks Hook if he saw Eric during the missing year, he lies to her, saying that he never heard of him, and as the others (David, Mary Margaret and Ariel) talk about finding him in Storybrooke, Hook refuses to help (believing that Eric is dead), but David wants Hook to help Ariel anyway while he and Mary Margaret watch over Henry. At Regina's vault, Regina warns Emma not to touch anything as they talk about Hook watching Henry and Hook flirting at Emma all the time. Regina then decides to teach her magic the tough way, using her magic to send Emma to a rope bridge across a deep chasm. Regina tells Emma that she's going to push her instincts, and as the boards start flying off the bridge, Regina says Emma has to reach into her gut; she can either stop it or die. Emma falls off the bridge, when she suddenly levitates herself back up to the top of the gorge. Meanwhile, Mary Margaret and David talk about how to be more fun and cool around Henry, and David later proceeds to teach Henry how to drive in his truck, as Henry almost causes an accident as he almost hits a car and hits a mailbox. Ariel and Hook pay a visit to Gold's shop and talk to Belle, where Hook finds his spyglass and notices an Ursula clasp that belonged to Eric. After a hopeful Ariel hugs Hook, Belle then pours a locator spell onto Eric's cloak, which will help bring them closer to Eric. At the docks, the two follow Eric's cloak as it floats through the air to the water, only to disappear under the surface, which disappoints Ariel, who starts to cry as she mourns her loss, and Hook tells her he's sorry. Ariel thanks Hook for helping find Eric's cloak, saying that she wishes she knew how it ended and that Hook has a true heart, adding that she will always be grateful to him. But as Hook runs up to Ariel he reveals to her they met in the missing year and explains what happened to Eric, saying that he was too ashamed to tell her before, he apologizes. Ariel calls Hook a coward and a monster because he traded a man's life for his ship. Then, when Hook begs for redemption, Ariel makes Hook swear that he still believes in love, and that he still loves the woman who broke his heart. Unfortunately, after admitting to his confession by swearing on Emma Swan's name, Ariel blows green powder onto Hook's lips and then transforms into Zelena, who had used her disguise as Ariel, because she knew that Hook's guilt from the day he chose the Jolly Roger over Eric would continue to haunt him. Zelena also cursed his kiss, meaning the next time he kisses Emma, her magic will disappear, leaving her powerless to stop Zelena. Since Hook realizes Zelena is unable to kill Emma, Zelena warns him that unless he kisses Emma to have her magic removed, she'll continue to threaten Emma's family and friends, by using Rumplestiltskin's dagger to kill them. Later that evening, Hook visits the loft, where he lies and tells Emma and Regina that Ariel had left to find Eric. Using a \\"magic mirror\\" spell, Emma watches the real Ariel and Eric embracing on a beach, happy and safe. As David, Mary Margaret and Henry return to the loft, Henry tells the others that he had a lot of fun with the couple. As Hook leaves, Emma tells him that even if he won't tell her what happened in the past year she's tired of living in the past.

He received honorary doctorates from Knox College, Toronto, Canada (1916); the College of Wooster, Ohio, USA (1923); and St. John's University, Shanghai (1929). He died in Shanghai after his visit to the mission work in southwest China and Guizhou in 1939. Biography Cheng Jingyi 1923 Born to a Manchu pastor who had been converted to Christianity by a pastor of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in Beijing, Cheng was educated first at home in the Chinese classics, then attended the Anglo-Chinese Institute of the LMS, graduating in 1896. Less than a month before the outbreak of the Boxer Uprising Cheng finished four years of studies in theology in Tianjin, one of the hotspots of fighting during the Allied Intervention. Cheng volunteered an interpreter and stretcher-bearer for the Allied forces. Cheng used his training in Classical Chinese to help George Owen of the LMS revise his translation of the New Testament before continuing his theological training at the Bible Institute in Glasgow, Scotland. He returned to China after his graduation in 1908. After his ordination in his home church, he was pastor to a newly independent church, the Mishi Hutung Church in the East City of Beijing, which was attended by a number of Chinese academics and professionals. The World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910 was a turning point in Cheng's career. The international mission movement had begun to recognize the need for \\"indigenization,\\" that is, for developing native leadership. In an address that lasted only seven minutes, which one attendee called the best of the conference, Cheng called for a united Christian church with no denominational divisions and for missionaries to turn control over to national church leaders. Cheng's challenging words impressed John R. Mott, who had been pushing world leaders to give more importance to the \\"younger churches\\" and equal representation in their leadership. Mott had paid special attention to China, which he first visited in 1896. Cheng was the only Chinese member of the thirty-five member international Continuation Committee formed to carry out the Conference's mandates and was appointed secretary of the continuation committee of the National Missionary Conference in China, formed after John R. Mott's visit to China in 1913. Cheng, at that time not yet 30 years old, thus became an important member of what historian Daniel Bays calls the \\"Sino-Foreign Protestant Establishment,\\" the mainstream missionary and Chinese church leadership. In 1917, Cheng led a campaign against the movement to allow only Confucian teachings for moral instruction in the schools. Arguing that the future of the church in China lay in indigenous leadership, he helped form the indigenous interdenominational Chinese Home Mission Society to reach the ethnic groups in southwest China and, in 1919, helped launch the China for Christ Movement (Zhonghua Guizhu Yundong), with the help of David Z. T. Yui, the General Secretary of the Chinese National YMCA as chair. The latter movement spread to some dozen cities, calling \\"for Christian involvement in forming public opinion and conscience s well as in delivering a practical and social message,\\" and aimed to promote China's nation building. It was merged into the longer standing China Continuation Committee. Cheng was general secretary of the National Christian Council from its establishment in 1922 until his resignation in 1933 because of poor health. In 1927, Cheng was elected the first moderator of the Church of Christ in China, a Protestant ecumenical organization comprising 16 denominations. He was on the executive committee of the International Missionary Council from 1928 to 1938. Cheng was deeply distressed by the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 because he was acquainted with many Japanese Christians and felt the war would do irreparable damage to Christian unity. Years of stress and constant travel weakened his health. He traveled to Southwest China to support mission work among tribal groups, and died on his return to Shanghai in 1940.

She is perhaps best known for being the first Din√© woman to ever become board certified in surgery. Her autobiography, The Scalpel and the Silver Bear, has brought increased attention to her career as a surgeon and has sold over 50,000 copies. Dr. Alvord was also nominated to serve as the U.S. Surgeon General in 2013. Dr. Alvord uses new techniques that bring together Navajo healing techniques and modern Western Medicine. Personal life Alvord was born in a small town called Crownpoint, New Mexico, which is located on a Navajo reservation adjacent to New Mexico, to a Din√© father and a White mother. English was the first language spoken in her home.http://www.lapahie.com/Lori_Arviso-Alvord.cfm She is a member of the Tsinnajinnie' (Black Streaked Wood) clan (Ponderosa Pine), and of the Ashihii' Din√© (Salt People) clan. Career Dr. Alvord graduated from Crownpoint High School in Crownpoint, New Mexico. . Alvord's academic career began when she was accepted to Dartmouth College. She initially majored in Natural Sciences before transitioning into a major focusing on social sciences. She graduated from Dartmouth College in 1979 after double majoring in psychology and sociology, and minoring in Native American studies. Following graduation from Dartmouth, Alvord undertook a career as a research assistant at the Veteran's Administration clinic in Albuquerque, New Mexico, New Mexico. The doctor who coordinated research in the lab suggested to Alvord that she should go to medical school, which caused her to blush. Alvord then enrolled in the University of New Mexico to retake pre-med courses and proceeded to apply to medical schools. She was accepted into Stanford University Medical School, where she earned her M.D. in 1985. She completed a six-year residency at Stanford University Hospital, and earned her board certification as a surgeon in 1994, which led to her becoming the first board-certified female Din√© surgeon. After studying medicine at Stanford University, Dr. Alvord returned to her Navajo reservation in New Mexico only to learn that, despite the importance of her technical proficiency in surgery, simply \\"fixing\\" the physical problem was not sufficient to fully cure a patient. Addressing the psychological and spiritual aspects of healing was important as well. This led to a more holistic approach to medicine that took into account the patient's environment and relationships, and also incorporated artwork and nature into the hospital's design. In her mind, \\"Beauty is so important ‚Äî artwork on the walls, gardens, outdoor porches with a view. A hospital should also have the right smells, the right foods, the right sounds, the things in life that soothe us. We should also avoid the things that are wrong, that cause stress ‚Äî no harsh sounds, no bright lights, no invasive overhead paging.\\" She has written a book on her experiences, entitled The Scalpel and the Silver Bear. From 1991‚Äì1997, Dr. Alvord practiced as a surgeon with the Indian Health Service, at one of its facilities in Gallup. Alvord was also the associate dean for student affairs at Dartmouth Medical School as well as assistant professor of surgery and psychiatry at Dartmouth from 1997‚Äì2009. From 2003 onwards, Dr. Alvord served as an Associate Faculty member for the Center for American Indian Health at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. From 2008‚Äì2010, Dr. Alvord served on the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NACCAM), the principal advisory body to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), a component of the National Institutes of Health. From 2010‚Äì2012, Dr. Alvord served as the Associate Dean of the Central Michigan University College of Medicine, which opened during the Fall 2013 semester. She played an instrumental role in developing the new medical school. She was also the associate dean of student affairs and admissions at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, in Tucson, Arizona from 2012‚Äì2014.

The mountain, which is visually isolated, gains its name due to its appearance of being \\"buried\\" into the ground, as it is 500 feet shorter than the rest of the Orocopia Mountains lying in the background.The Salton Sea Geography The mountain sits between Interstate 10 and Box Canyon Road, the old alignment of California State Route 195. The land is owned by the Bureau of Land Management, and the surrounding wash is occasionally used as a campsite and staging area for utility companies and youth groups. Immediately to the north of the mountain is the Buried Mountain Wash, which can be accessed through a dirt road, originally routed in the 1930s for utility purposes. To the south is the Box Canyon Wash, through which Box Canyon Road traverses. Box Canyon Wash travels through the eponymous Box Canyon of the nearby Mecca Hills, a popular area for geology instruction.This is obvious from the large amount of instructional material on the area, e.g. UIUC field trip bibliography and teaching slides. A series of wells were present at Buried Mountain, which supplied water for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. A transmission line runs to the south of the mountain.MWD Formation Geology The summit consists primarily of aplitic Mesozoic granite, younger than the Orocopia schist that it overlies. The base of the mountain is cut by a large fault, creating a significant non-conformity between the steep slopes of the mountain and lower shallow reaches, which are conglomerates and breccias of the Eocene Maniobra Formation.Dibblee, T.W., and Minch, J.A., 2008, Geologic map of the Cottonwood Spring & Canyon Spring 15 minute quadrangles, Riverside County, California: Dibblee Geological Foundation, Dibblee Foundation Map DF-375, scale 1:62,500 References Mountains of Riverside County, California Mountain ranges of the Colorado Desert Mountains of Southern California ","title":"Buried Mountain"},{"id":"42486290","text":"A Spontaneous Performance Recording!: The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, sometimes simply called A Spontaneous Performance, is a 1961 collection of traditional Irish folk songs performed by The Clancy Brothers with frequent collaborator Tommy Makem. It was their first album for Columbia Records. The group would continue to record for Columbia for the remainder of the 1960s. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1962 for Best Folk Recording. The LP had originally been considered a self-titled album with \\"A Spontaneous Performance Recording!\\" merely a description of the record for the cover. It is referred to as The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem in the original reviews of the album and for its Grammy Nomination. It later became known as A Spontaneous Performance Recording to avoid confusion, because the group already had released a less popular album entitled The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem on the little Tradition Records label that Paddy Clancy ran. One of the leaders of the American folk music revival, Pete Seeger, played the banjo on the recording. In 2007 on the BBC, influential folk singer and songwriter Christy Moore chose the song, \\"Brennan on the Moor,\\" from this album as one of his desert island discs. He introduced the song by noting, \\"The Clancy Brothers changed my life,\\" because through them he discovered a love for Irish folk music. Reception A review in Variety praised the album's style as \\"exciting because it isn't yet overdone.\\" It also lauded the \\"lively\\" musical accompaniment of Seeger and Bruce Langhorne and the singing of the live audience on the album. Even though the reviewer noted that the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem were only starting to get prominent live gigs at that point, he said already \\"the group was built along solid pro lines.\\" The Billboard Magazine review rated the album with four stars and noted its \\"strong sales potential.\\" After referring to the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem as an \\"Irish Brothers Four or Kingston Trio,\\" the article praised the group's \\"delightfully droll manner\\" and \\"spirited interpretations\\" on the recording. The New York Times lauded the album for its \\"vigor and drive and charm,\\" but also criticized an apparent speeding up of the recording that \\"distorts the group's natural sound\\" and made the singers sound too much like American pop groups. In a more specialized review of folk albums, D. K. Wilgus argued that this record \\"demonstrates that general respect for tradition may survive in a stage concert for a major label.\\" He also expressed the opinion that A Spontaneous Performance was at about the same level as the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem's self-titled album on Tradition Records that was released earlier the same year. Other releases and reissues In 1961, side one of A Spontaneous Performance Recording was released as an EP, The Moonshiner. Side two was also released in EP format as Tim Finnegan's Wake. In 2009, Sony Legacy reissued the entire album in mp3 format for download. In 2012 Jasmine Music re-released A Spontaneous Performance as part of the four- album collection on two CDs, Raise a Glass to the Sounds of...The Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem, which also included the albums, The Rising of the Moon, Come Fill Your Glass with Us, and The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. In addition, selections from the album were released on CD as part of The Clancy Brothers Collection 1956-1962 in late 2013. This compilation also includes the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem's second Columbia record, The Boys Won't Leave the Girls Alone, as well as the group's earlier Tradition Records albums. Several songs from this album have appeared on various Clancy Brothers compilation recordings.

It was presented by Mohammad Samir Hossain as an answer to the overwhelming anxiety and grief about death.Md Zakaria Siddique, \\"A review of Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses\\", Death Studies, vol. 33, no. 2 (2009).Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, and Fred Peterson (eds.). The Truth about Death and Dying. 2nd ed. New York: DWJ Books, 2009, p. 106. In an attempt to find the resolution to death anxiety, predominantly the existential one, DAH postulates two key themes. Its first part postulates that death should not be considered the end of existence and the second part emphasizes that the belief in immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually. Beginning The theory was first promoted in the book Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses in 2007. A second book with its elaboration, Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated, was published in 2008. Both books were authored by Hossain. Later the journal Death Studies and Royal College of Psychiatrists reviewed these publications for the readerships in Scientific Thanatology and Spiritual Psychiatry.Gilbert, P. (2009). Human Adjustment and the Problem of Death. Death Studies, 33 (8), 771‚Äì774Siddique, M. Z. (2009)Reviewing the Phenomenon of Death‚ÄîA Scientific Effort from the Islamic World.

London. at http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/college/specialinterestgroups/spirituality/publications/newsletter27.aspx After the analyses of the reviewers were published, the Royal College of Psychiatrists at London published the theory itself as the short article Facing the Finality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheseshttp://rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf and the Taylor & Francis publication Journal of Loss and Trauma did the same in its article \\"Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses\\".Mohammad Samir Hossain. \\"Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses\\". Journal of Loss and Trauma, vol. 15, no. 4 (2010). Background Hossain was intolerant to death himself. His childhood was terrified with the anticipatory thoughts of his parents' death. When his elder son Mohammad Seeyam Samir died, parallel to developing support for himself, Hossain decided to put forward his resolutions for death anxiety and grief through the scientific readerships. His research works during and after that period gave birth to the articles and books that he later published promoting the theory and for sufferers of intense death anxiety. Hossain's works on the theory further flourished as his parents' terminal illnesses appeared and compelled him to adjust himself comprehensively to the phenomenon of death for a peaceful personal life. He admitted in one of his autobiographical articles that without the turmoils in his own life he could never realize about the disasters and work to prevent them.Hossain, MS, 2011, Abstinence: A Memoir, Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16:5 Key components Factors behind the DAH are described in European Psychiatry, Volume 26, Supplement 1, Page 1727 in the following manner ‚Äì \\"Viewed from a naturalistic and scientific perspective, death appears to represent the permanent cessation of human existence, contributing to the widespread experience of death anxiety. The present argument attempts to deconstruct this argument on epistemological grounds by analyzing 1) the prevailing universal concept of death in naturalistic discourse, 2) the issue of our adjustment to this presumed reality, and 3) the relationship between existence and death in the context of their social evolution. Integrating this conceptual analysis with empirical observations, the paper then explores the contrasting postulate, namely that death may not be the end of our existence, and the moral implications of this alternative assumption. This position, termed the \\"death adjustment hypotheses,\\" would seem to offer an alternative grounding for theory and research in Thanatology.\\" =Concept of death= Finding a common platform regarding the concept of death was the first step towards this work. Dr Hossain's finding was that without a common idea about death people will not be able to share the same remedy for death anxiety.Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. Illness, Crisis and Loss, Vol 18. No 1 There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Book Review by Dr. Peter FenwickFacing the finality ‚Äì Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009 It was Hossain's claim that whenever death is taken as permanent and absolute cessation of human existence, morbid fear of death begins; therefore DAH he presented with different ideas of death in relation to existence to reach a conclusion that will be acceptable to most.Hossain, M S. 2007. Quest for a new death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US =Death anxiety as a whole= Death anxiety is the central concern of DAH. It is the morbid, abnormal or persistent fear of one's own death or the process of his/her dying. One definition of death anxiety is a \\"feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to ‚Äòbe‚Äô\\".Definition by Farley G.: Death anxiety. National Health Service UK. 2010, found in: It is also referred to as thanatophobia (fear of death), and is distinguished from necrophobia, which is a specific fear of dead or dying persons and/or things (i.e. others who are dead or dying, not one's own death or dying).The American Heritage¬Æ Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ¬©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company DAH proposes that no one is free from this anxiety unless there is something significantly positive in the phenomenon of death for humans. Hossain claimed, the idea of 'cessation of existence' through death is the prime factor responsible for initiating death anxiety in one.Hossain, M S.2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US. =Existential death anxiety= It is apparent that Hossain's description of death anxiety in DAH actually overlaps the idea of existential death anxiety, which is the basic knowledge and awareness that life must end. However, DAH indicates 'existence' as the primary humane need and 'pleasure' as the secondary one. Therefore, DAH postulates, though existential death anxiety strongly correlates behavioral changes,Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books; Langs, R. (2004). \\"Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind,\\" Psychoanalytic Psychology, vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling. London: Palgrave-Macmillan pleasure in existence must be ensured to maintain the balance between life and death peacefully. Hossain, in the iteration of DAH, highlighted how this sort of death anxiety evolved in the society through time based on his analysis of the history of the West starting from 5th century up to 20th century. DAH adds that assurance of pleasure or pain-free status in any existence after death is another key factor in adjusting with the phenomenon of death even if one is not overwhelmed by existential death anxiety due to his/her belief in any sort of existence after death.Hossain, M S. 2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing. Charleston, US =Materialism, immorality and judgment issues= Hossain explained, as existence after death creates the scope for being judged and punished for the immoral deeds in life, most self-claimed believers pass through the denial of afterlife for their immorality in search of limitless materialistic pleasure. Therefore, one of the key propositions of DAH was the fact that mostly humans abandon their moral ethics due to heightened materialism that gives birth to existential death anxiety even among the self-claimed believers in the existence after death.Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, Fred Peterson. Infobase Publishing, 2009, 106 page. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&pg;=PA106&lpg;=PA106&dq;=Mohammad+Samir+Hossain Declarations of the Death and adjustment hypotheses As outlined very briefly in journal articles, DAH hypothesizes the following for optimum attitude towards death as well as to harmonize the adjustment problems in relation to the phenomenon: *Death and Adjustment Hypotheses ‚Äì One: In the absence of empirical evidence from science, to regard death to be not our absolute end seems natural and is an epistemologically sound point of view. Therefore, it is also more useful practically and for our adjustment to the phenomenon. *Death and Adjustment Hypotheses ‚Äì Two: Changing our materialistic view to a moral one on life can help eradicate the social denial of death through the establishment of a sound concept of the phenomenon at personal and societal level, which should also potentate our adjustment to the phenomenon.

A real-world application of this phenomenon occurs in airport security screening; since a very small proportion of those going through security checkpoints carry weapons, security staff may fail to detect those attempting to carry weapons onto a plane.J. M. Wolfe, D. N. Brunelli, J. Rubinstein, T. S. Horowitz. Prevalence effects in newly trained airport checkpoint screeners: Trained observers miss rare targets, too. Journal of Vision, 2013; 13 (3): 33 DOI: 10.1167/13.3.33 In visual perception, target prevalence describes the salience (or visibility) of an object or objects in the environment and influences visual search.Wolfe, J. and Van Wert, M. (2010) Varying Target Prevalence Reveals Two Dissociable Decision Criteria in Visual Search. Current Biology 20, 121-124. An experimentWolfe, J. M., Horowitz, T. S., & Kenner, N. M. (2005). Rare items often missed in visual searches. Nature, 435, 439-440. similar to an x-ray baggage search at an airport reveals how likely one is to make errors when searching for low-prevalence targets. A 50-percent prevalence produced a seven-percent error rate, typical for laboratory search tasks of this sort; a 10-percent prevalence produced a 16-percent error rate, and prevalence under one percent produced a 30-percent error rate. Humans normally search for common things, such as a favorite jelly-bean flavor in a collection of flavors. When they look for rare things (such as a jelly bean in a bag of lollipops), they are likely to abandon the search quickly because the probability of success and the stakes are low. Some searches combine low prevalence with high stakes; medical screenings such as mammography or cytopathology, is an important search for a target rarely present (typically under one percent).Fenton, J. J., Taplin, S. H., Carney, P. A., Abraham, L., Sickles, E. A., D‚ÄôOrsi, C., et al. (2007). Influence of computer-aided detection on performance of screening mammography. New England Journal of Medicine, 356, 1399‚Äì1409. Missing a rare target, such as a weapon smuggled onto an airplane, may have serious consequences.  Past experience or future prospect  The prevalence effect is influenced by top-down control of a future prospect or the bottom-up priming of past experience. Top-down refers to the expectation effect: knowledge of what will happen next. The bottom-up, repetition effect is produced by the sharing of properties by current and preceding stimuli. Observers may miss rare targets because they knew that the targets are (or were) rare. Research has attempted to distinguish these possibilities by creating situations in which past experience is different from the future prospect; the target has been frequent in the past, but is known to be rare in the future. It was found that the prevalence effect is a consequence of bottom-up experience and unaffected by top-down control.Lau, J. S. H., & Huang, L. (2010). The prevalence effect is determined by past experience, not future prospects. Vision Research, 50(15), 1469-1474. = Nature of the effect = Prevalence effects provide insight into how observers adjust their quitting criteria; according to research, observers require a threshold for quitting when no target has been found.Evans, K.

This threshold is fluid; observers may slow down after mistakes and speed up after success.Chun, M. M., & Wolfe, J. M. (1996). Just say no: How are visual searches terminated when there is no target present? Cognitive Psychology, 30, 39‚Äì78 When targets are frequent (above 50-percent prevalence), fast \\"no\\" responses often lead to mistakes and \\"no\\" reaction times are slower than \\"yes\\" times in high-prevalence searches. With infrequent targets (low prevalence), searches can successfully say \\"no\\" nearly always and drive down the quitting threshold. When the observer is being asked to respond quickly, the absent response (i.e. no target) may sometimes be given inadvertently‚Äîproducing miss errors.Rich, A., Hidalgo-Sotelo, B., Kunar, M., Van Wert, M., Wolfe, J. What happens during search for rare targets? Eye movements in low prevalence visual search. Paper presented at the Visual Sciences Society; Sarasota, FL. May 2006; 2006. = Eye-tracking experiments = Eye tracking experiments demonstrate that a large prevalence effect can occur across a group of participants with targets of similar appearance. In the experiment, participants had to discriminate the letter T from several similar-looking Ls. With a low prevalence, participants missed about 40 percent of the rare targets and responded more rapidly to target-absent trails than they did in high-prevalence conditions. (Previous work generally used simple stimuli.) Researchers discovered that when a target is rare, participants spend less time searching before concluding that it is absent (regardless of stimuli complexity). Eye-tracking data suggests that many errors at low prevalence were attributable to participants terminating the search without finding the target. Although cues suggested a higher target probability, searchers took longer to respond \\"no\\" (suggesting that the prevalence effect is ingrained).Rich, A., Kunar, M., Hidalgo-Sotelo, B., Van Wert, M., Wolfe, J. Why do we miss rare targets? Exploring the boundaries of the low prevalence effect. Journal of Vision (2008) 8(15): 15, 1-17 = Effects on perception = The nature of the prevalence effect is debated, and its source may be attributed to motor error.Fleck, M. S., & Mitroff, S. R. (2007). Rare targets rarely missed in correctable search. Psychological Science, 18(11), 943‚Äì947. Researchers found that when observers repeatedly pressed the same key for target-absent trials in low-prevalence blocks, they tended to press the same key too fast even if they could see the target. When participants had a chance to correct their responses, their miss rates were reduced (demonstrating that if motor responses contribute to the prevalence effect, there is a perceptual effect if the task is difficult). Random mapping switched the response keys from trial to trial, preventing the motor responses from becoming automatic. Even with this difference, participants made more errors when the target prevalence was low and allowing observers to correct their decisions does not counteract a low prevalence effect.Wolfe, J. M., Horowitz, T. S., Van Wert, M. J., Kenner, N. M., Place, S. S., & Kibbi, N. (2007). Low target prevalence is a stubborn source of errors in visual search tasks. Journal of experimental Psychology: General, 136, 623-638. The prevalence effect disappeared when there was a great discrepancy between gain and loss for correct and incorrect responses, such as when observers competed for a prize.  Applications  In typical laboratory visual-search tasks, observers look for a target item among distractor items. Factors modulating search difficulty are well understood: # As the difference between the target and distractors gets smaller, the search becomes harder.Wolfe, J., Horowitz, T., Kenner, N. M., Hyle, M., & Vasan, N. (2004). How fast can you change your mind? The speed of top-down guidance in visual search. Vision Research, 44(12), 1411‚Äì1426. # As the target definition becomes more abstract, the search becomes more difficult. # It is more difficult to find the target if its vicinity is cluttered.Beck, M. R., Lohrenz, M. C., & Trafton, J. G. (2010). Measuring search efficiency in complex visual search tasks: global and local clutter. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 16(3), 238‚Äì250 # Finding an object is more difficult if clutter is random.Eckstein, M. P., Drescher, B. A., & Shimozaki, S. S. (2006). Attentional cues in real scenes, saccadic targeting, and Bayesian priors. Psychological Science, 17(11), 973‚Äì980. Compared to lab experiments, real-world factors are more challenging; customs officers, for example, experience all these factors in their x-ray screening tasks. The target is broadly defined (and changes with time); target items are not always uniquely marked, and distractors are diverse and often similar to the original. X-rays add the challenges of object transparency and overlap, and screeners have a low chance of encountering a weapon; they have a higher prevalence of finding prohibited items (such as water bottles) and opaque areas which may conceal a threat. Breast-cancer detection is also a generally low-prevalence search task. Researchers who slipped positive images into the workflow of a breast-cancer screening facility found that low- prevalence error rate was over twice as high as that for the same images viewed in a high-prevalence setting. Similar results were found with expert readers of Pap tests.Evans, K. K., Tambouret, R., Wilbur, D. C., Evered, A., & Wolfe, J. M. (2011). Prevalence of abnormalities influences cytologists‚Äô error rates in screening for cervical cancer. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, 135(12), 1557‚Äì1560, = Transport security officers = Recently trained transport security officers (TSOs) examined test images of bags with and without inserted threat images; threats were inserted at low and high prevalence rates. Research has found that a period of high-prevalence testing with good feedback to the observer reduces the miss rate for a subsequent period of low prevalence with poor feedback, so a feedback task was introduced between both experiments. Miss error rates were higher at low prevalence than at high, although they provided feedback for the high-prevalence task. The feedback, rather than the prevalence manipulation, may have changed the TSOs‚Äô behavior in the final test. Feedback magnifies the effects of prevalence by giving the searcher information about prevalence. If prevalence alters the behavior of TSOs, it may be counteracted. In laboratory settings, the effect appears resistant to a number of attempted solutions. One solution would be to raise the prevalence rate to 50 percent by adding threat-image projections (TIP) to half of the bags. The time required to clear a bag with a TIP is greater than that required to clear a bag without one, and the bag would need to be re-scanned without the TIP to make sure it did not obscure a real target.Samuel, S., Kundel, H. L., Nodine, C. F., & Toto, L. C. (1995). Mechanism of satisfaction of search: eye position recordings in the reading of chest radiographs.  Prevalence and vigilance  Knowledge of the probability of a target in the next bag does not suppress the prevalence effect, suggesting that low-prevalence search is similar to vigilance tasks in which observers await fleeting signals. This phenomenon has been observed in vigilance literature as \\"signal-probability effects\\". It has been demonstrated that low signal probability reduces hit rates in classical low-event-rate, low-cognitive-load vigilance tasks by shifting criteria rather than decreasing sensitivity,Davies, D. R., & Parasuraman, R. (1982). The psychology of vigilance. London: Academic Press. and these effects are accompanied by slowed \\"yes\\" reaction times and faster \\"no\\" reaction times.Parasuraman, R., & Davies, D. R. (1976).

These areas of anomalous topography are byproducts of large upwelling of mantle material from the core‚Äìmantle boundary, referred to as superplumes. Two present day superswells have been identified: the African superswell and the South Pacific superswell. In addition to these, the Darwin Rise in the south central Pacific Ocean is thought to be a paleosuperswell, showing evidence of being uplifted compared to surrounding ancient ocean topography. The image above illustrates the interaction between superplumes and superswells. Superplume Data shows a dramatic increase in crustal production from 125-120 Ma. (million years) to 70 Ma, largely in East Pacific Rise areas, although the marked increase in production rates of crustal material was also seen in the Gondwana ridges, as well as in oceanic plateaus. This period of increased crustal production is interpreted as a superplume event. This \\"pulse\\" of increased crustal production peaked soon after the initial plume (between 120 Ma and 100 Ma), and then declined over the next thirty million years. Along with the increase in crustal output from ridges, there is an extended period in the time frame from 125 Ma to 40 Ma where the earth's magnetic field reversal frequency declines sharply. The last remnants of this superplume event are the South Pacific superswell located underneath Tahiti. Superplume mechanism of action Superplume/superswell creation is a large upwelling of material. Normal upwellings in the mantle are a common occurrence, as it is generally accepted that these upwellings are the driving force behind mantle convection and subsequent plate motion. In the case of the upwelling in the mid-Cretaceous Period along the East Pacific Rise, its origin lies deep within the earth, near the core‚Äìmantle boundary. This conclusion is taken from the fact that the earth retained a constant field polarity at the same time that this upwelling occurred. South Africa Topography A more current superplume/superswell is in the southern and eastern region of Africa. Seismic analysis shows a large low-shear-velocity province, which coincides with a region of upwelling of semi-liquid material which is a poor conductor of seismic waves. While there are several processes at work in the formation of these high topography zones, lithospheric thinning and lithospheric heating have been unable to predict the topographic upwelling on the African plate. Dynamic topography models have, on the other hand, been able to predict this upwelling utilizing calculations of the instantaneous flow of Earth's mantle. Evidence for mid-Cretaceous superswell Isotopic samples taken from the Pacific-Antarctic ridge basalts have disassembled the long-held belief that there was a coherent geochemical province stretching from the Australian- Antarctic discordance to the Juan de Fuca plate. Instead, samples have shown that there are instead two distinct geochemical domains above and below the Easter microplate. Measurements of the average depth of ridge axes also shows that this boundary line lies on the southeastern side of the Darwin Rise/Pacific Superswell. It was concluded that this upwelling was responsible for the disparity between the two geochemical regions. Volcanic island chain offsets by superswell activity One of the many ways that plate motions are mapped is by using hotspot activity and volcanic island chains. It is assumed that hotspots are stable relative to the motion of the island chain, and is therefore used as a point of reference. In the case of the Marquesas Islands, an island chain in the region of the South Pacific Superswell, the age progression of the island chain is much shorter than models have predicted. Also, the path that these island chains take does not coincide with the motion of the plate.

Political career Barrett was elected at a by-election held on 12 April 2014 as a member of the governing Country Liberal Party. The vacancy was caused by the resignation of former Chief Minister Terry Mills.2014 Blain by-election: Antony Green ABC Although Blain, like most seats in the Palmerston area, had historically been CLP heartland, the by-election came at a difficult time for the CLP government. A week after the writ was issued, three indigenous CLP MPs defected to the crossbench. Had Barrett lost, the CLP would have been forced into a minority government. Ultimately, Barrett won, though the CLP suffered a swing of over 10 percent. In February 2016, Barrett was promoted to Cabinet as Minister for Sport and Recreation, Minister for Young Territorians, and Minister Assisting the Treasurer. He was slated to become Treasurer after the 2016 estimates hearings. However, on 10 June, when Northern Territory News reported that he had sent a video of himself engaging in a sex act to a constituent with whom he had been having an affair, Barrett resigned from Cabinet. On 12 June, under growing pressure from the CLP's organisational wing, he announced that he would not contest the upcoming election. He then resigned from the CLP on 28 June 2016, and served out the rest of his term as an independent. In a speech announcing his move to the crossbench, he accused his political enemies of resorting to a base attack to bring him down. At that election, Blain was won by Barrett's predecessor, Mills, who ran as an independent.

Schuppanzigh was a close friend and admirer of Ludwig van Beethoven, and the quartet gave the first performances of many of Beethoven's string quartets. Origins Joseph Mayseder in 1838 Ignaz Schuppanzigh assembled an informal string quartet for Prince Lichnowsky in 1795. Its membership varied; the more regular players, all aged under 20, were Louis Sina playing second violin, Franz Weiss playing viola and Nikolaus Kraft playing cello. Beethoven's first set of string quartets, Op. 18, which were completed in 1800, were first performed by Schuppanzigh's quartet. In 1805 Schuppanzigh formed his own quartet; the other players were Joseph Mayseder (second violin), Anton Schreiber (viola) and Anton√≠n Kraft, the father of Nikolaus Kraft (cello). Their first concerts took place in Heiligenkreutzerhof, a private house; later in the restaurant R√∂mischer Kaiser.Paul Nettl. \\"Schuppanzigh, Ignaz\\" in Beethoven Encyclopedia. Philosophical Library, New York, 1956. Count Razumovsky's quartet In 1808 Count Andrey Razumovsky, who was an amateur musician and liked to gather musicians in his palace to play chamber music, commissioned Schuppanzigh to assemble a string quartet.

The following year Schuppanzigh's quartet gave the first performance of this work; Beethoven was not pleased with the performance, for which he blamed Schuppanzigh, but the quartet later performed the two other string quartets commissioned by Galitzin: String Quartet Op. 130 and String Quartet Op. 132.

It is a privately run animal refuge in the Yungas area of Bolivia. The organization is co-founded by Vicky Ossio and Marcelo Levy in 2003. Yungas Road The Yungas Road, as it descends into the rainforest Yungas Road leads to the La Senda Verde animal refuge. It is a popular tourist destination starting in the 1990s, drawing approximately 25,000 thrillseekers. This is one of the few routes that connects the Amazon rainforest region of northern Bolivia, or Yungas, to its capital city. Upon leaving La Paz, the road first ascends to around at La Cumbre Pass, before descending to at the town of Coroico, transiting quickly from cool Altiplano terrain to rainforest as it winds through very steep hillsides and atop cliffs. Legal restrictions Laws in Bolivia strictly forbid the return of certain endangered animals back into the wild. However, the same law does not prevent animals living in semi-captivity, where the animals fulfil a pedagogic role as the refuge regularly hosts both school and university groups. Mining issues In 2010, Corporaci√≥n Minera de Bolivia began works on a gold mine in a riverbed of Coroico River. In January 2010, the movement of the river channel caused by backhoes machines flooded some parts of La Senda Verde. In the aftermath, Vicky Ossio, owner of Senda Verde, stated that the damage to the animal shelter has been tremendous.

History Map of iron ore mines in the Pilbara region Hamersley Iron Alco C628 at Dampier in July 2003 BHP Billiton EMD SD70ACes in April 2012 Rio Tinto GE ES44DCi at Brockman 4 mine in June 2012 Fortescue Metals Group GE Dash 9-44CWs in May 2008 In 1887, the Cossack Tram openedFrom the Past The Daily News 4 April 1914 followed by the Western Australian Government Railways's (WAGR) Marble Bar Railway in 1911. However these had closed by the 1950s. Following the opening up (by the WA government) of the Pilbara region for mining in the 1960s, four companies began to mine and export the iron ore. Because of the distances from the mines to the sea ports, railways were built as the most economical method to transport the ore. Unlike other lines in Western Australia that were built to narrow-gauge, all of the Pilbara lines were built to the Association of American Railroads' standard-gauge for both track and rollingstock loading gauge. This came about because it was determined by the iron ore industry that the required duty was going to be \\"heavy-haul\\" and it was considered that the track structure and rollingstock needed to be to standard-gauge scale. These \\"railroads\\" (as they were called) were built by a U.S. railroad construction joint venture, Morrison-Knudsen-Mannix-Oman (MKMO).Construction of the Mt. Newman Iron Ore Railroad by Norman Leslie Smithson and Driving the last spike - official opening of the Mt Newman Iron Ore Railroad, 22 January 1969 by Norman Leslie Smithson The first company to commence operations in June 1966 was Goldsworthy Mining Ltd with a line from Mount Goldsworthy to Finucane Island. In August 1966, Hamersley Iron (a Rio Tinto company) opened a 298-kilometre line from Mount Tom Price to a new port at East Intercourse Island, near Dampier. This was extended shortly after by 100 kilometres to a second mine at Paraburdoo. In March 1969, the Mount Newman Mining Pty Ltd joint venture began operating a 427-kilometre line from its Mount Whaleback mine to Port Hedland. The Cliffs Robe River Iron Associates joint venture opened a 162-kilometre line from Mount Enid to Cape Lambert, near Wickham, in July 1972. Since then, the iron ore trackage has been expanded as new mines have opened. With mergers and takeovers, there has been considerable consolidation of mine (and railroad trackage) ownership, particularly with BHP Billiton Iron Ore Pty Ltd and Rio Tinto. On 21 June 2001, eight BHP Billiton GE AC6000CWs combined to set the world record for the longest and heaviest train; hauling a 682-car, 99,734 gross-tonne (82,000 tonnes of ore), 7.3 kilometre-long train.BHP breaks its own 'heaviest train' record Railway Gazette International 1 August 2001 In April 2008, Fortescue Metals Group opened a line from Cloud Break mine to Port Hedland.Fortescue opens the world's heaviest haul railway Railway Gazette International 14 July 2008 In November 2015, Hancock Prospecting will open a 344 kilometre line from Roy Hill.Rail Roy Hill As at early 2014, iron ore trackage in the Pilbara was 2,295 kilometres long. It accounted for 94% of all Australian iron ore exports.Trainline 2 Statistical Report Bureau of Infrastructure Transport & Regional Economics 2014 page 21 In 2013, Aurizon in conjunction with Brockman Mining and Atlas Iron under an Alliance Study Agreement, completed a study for a new independent iron ore railway in the Pilbara.East Pilbara Independent Railway Aurizon Rollingstock Goldsworthy Mining Ltd operated locomotives to the same design as the WAGR H and K classes as well as one EMD JT42C (GML10, based on both the VicRail N and Australian National DL classes).

He also played for Mugiemoss, Raith Rovers (on loan), Shildon, Peterhead and Montrose. He was deaf. Life and career Greig was born in Aberdeen, and played Junior football with Mugiemoss before beginning his senior career with Aberdeen F.C. After playing for the reserve team during the 1910‚Äì11 season, he made his first-team debut on 25 September 1911, keeping a clean sheet as Aberdeen beat Queen's Park 3‚Äì0. The Scotsman reported that \\"Greig appeared in goal for the home team, and got an encouraging reception, which ultimate events proved to be well deserved.\\" He played 22 times in the 1911‚Äì12 Scottish Division One season, fewer in the next, before returning to first-team duties on a regular basis in 1913‚Äì14. He remained with the club, appearing infrequently, until the end of the 1916‚Äì17 season, when Aberdeen withdrew from the league because of the First World War. He finished his Aberdeen career with 80 appearances in league competition and 7 in the Scottish Cup. He played on loan to Raith Rovers during the war. Greig was one of numerous players recruited by English club Darlington Forge Albion, which was established to represent the town of Darlington in the 1919 Northern Victory League after Darlington F.C. had folded during the war. He was ever- present in that competition, and remained with the club as they adopted the Darlington F.C. name and its place in the North Eastern League. He played in the defeat of First Division club Sheffield Wednesday in the 1919‚Äì20 FA Cup, in front of 52,388 spectators at Hillsborough ‚Äì the Daily Express reported that Greig was \\"tested with all manner of shots, but always emerged triumphant\\", and that he and his full-backs were \\"as sound a defence as one could wish for\\". He contributed to the team's North Eastern League title the following year, which confirmed the club's invitation to join the new Football League Third Division North. He made his debut in the Football League on 5 November 1921 in a 3‚Äì0 defeat of Barrow, and retained his place, keeping John Ward out of the team, until April 1922 when he broke his arm during a match. He regained his regular starting place for the next two seasons, taking his appearance totals to 95 Football League matches and 10 in the FA Cup, but the club's financial problems meant they had to let players leave, and Greig spent time with Shildon before returning to Scotland where he played for Peterhead and Montrose.

He was on the books of Sheffield Wednesday, without playing for the club's first team, and also played non-league football for Esh Winning and Shrewsbury Town. Life and career Parkinson was born in 1911 in Neville's Cross, County Durham, the son of Walter Parkinson, a cokeman, and his wife, Eliza. He played football for Esh Winning of the Northern League, and was a member of the Durham Amateur XI that faced a North-Eastern League selection in April 1933 as part of the Durham FA's jubilee celebrations. After trials with their reserve team towards the end of the 1932‚Äì33 season, Parkinson signed professional forms with Football League First Division club Sheffield Wednesday. He played regularly in the reserves, and was retained for the 1934‚Äì35 season, but got no closer to the first team, and was listed for transfer at a fee of ¬£100. Described as \\"a goalkeeper of whom much is expected\\", Parkinson joined Shrewsbury Town for the 1935‚Äì36 season, during which he made 40 appearances and helped them finish third in the Birmingham League. He then signed for Football League Third Division North club Darlington, whose regular goalkeeper, Harry Walker, was recovering from a knee cartilage operation. He began the season in the first team, and kept his place even after Walker returned to fitness, but a bout of influenza at the turn of the year gave Walker his opening. After a run of five defeats that left Darlington bottom of the table, Parkinson returned, but there was little improvement, and they shared the role until the end of the season. The club's application for re-election was successful, and both goalkeepers were among just six players retained. Parkinson began the 1937‚Äì38 season in possession, but a broken bone in his wrist let Walker back in, and his performances earned him a ¬£1000 transfer to First Division Portsmouth. Parkinson kept goal for the last couple of months of Darlington's season, and for most of the next. He was left out in December to give Frank Gower his Football League debut, but after a 4‚Äì0 loss to Southport, Parkinson returned to the team at the end of January and remained in it. Along with most of Darlington's contracted players, he was given a free transfer at the end of the season. The 1939 Register finds Parkinson working as an annealing furnaceman in a steel foundry and living in Darlington with his wife, Maria Annie n√©e Vest, whom he married in 1936, and their baby son, Walter.

The deal was proposed to take the form of a stock swap, estimated at the time of announcement to be worth about $45.2 billion. The two companies argued that the merger would increase their overall scale, allowing the company to become more competitive, improve customer service quality, and quicken innovation. The companies also argued that the deal would increase competition in the United States' cable television and internet markets, as they planned to divest subscribers to Charter Communications to regulate the market share of their combined operation. The deal was supported primarily by Comcast, along with groups that were affiliated with Comcast or received financial support from Comcast or the National Cable & Telecommunications Association. It was also found that some letters in support of the merger were ghostwritten by Comcast representatives. The merger was widely opposed by various individuals, groups, and corporations, arguing that it would reduce competition through consolidation of the cable industry, lead to higher costs of service, and give Comcast greater leverage in how it distributes content owned by its NBCUniversal division to competitors, such as over-the-top services. Citing the reduction of competition in the broadband and cable industries that would result from the merger, the Department of Justice planned to file an antitrust lawsuit against Comcast and Time Warner Cable in an effort to block it. On April 24, 2015, Comcast announced that it would withdraw its proposal to acquire TWC. Afterward, TWC would enter into an agreement to be acquired by Charter Communications. Overview =Background= On November 22, 2013, it was widely reported that Comcast was seeking advice on a possible bid for Time Warner Cable. Charter Communications was also thinking of making an offer. Charter made a total of three attempts to buy Time Warner Cable, offering $37.4 billion on January 13, 2014. Comcast's $45.2 billion offer effectively won Comcast the bidding war, though Charter continued to challenge the acquisition by forecasting difficulties with the regulatory review process. By April 27, however, Charter had backed off its opposition to the deal after reaching a deal to acquire a portion of Time Warner Cable's subscribers as part of it. Under the deal, Comcast would acquire Time Warner Cable by exchanging each of Time Warner Cable's current 284.9 million shares for 2.875 shares of Comcast's CMCSA stock. In addition, Comcast would divest 1.4 million Time Warner Cable subscribers to Charter Communications for about $7.3 billion, and divest 2.5 million subscribers to a new public company which would be owned 66% by Comcast shareholders, and 33% by Charter, which would manage its network and customers. Finally, Comcast and Charter would swap about 1.6 million subscribers with each other. The proposed merger was approved by Comcast shareholders on October 8, 2014 and Time Warner Cable shareholders the next day. Comcast touted that the merger would create a \\"world class media and technology company\\"; Comcast CEO Brian L. Roberts explained that the companies would be able to innovate quicker, and remain competitive with newer entrants into the industry, such as Verizon and Google Fiber. Similarly, TWC CEO Robert D. Marcus stated that the merger would \\"[create] a company that delivers maximum value for our shareholders, enormous opportunities for our employees and a superior experience for our customers.\\" Details by topic =Infrastructure= Comcast and Time Warner Cable did not directly compete for customers; there was no physical overlap in the respective service areas where they offer services. More generally, there is almost no physical overlap in the service areas of any of the US cable providers. Unlike countries where local-loop unbundling allows multiple companies to offer competing service over the same physical lines, current policy in the United States allows incumbent companies to maintain exclusive use of the telecommunications infrastructure that they own. In advocating for their 2011 purchase of NBC Universal, Comcast did identify Time Warner Cable as a competitor and cited the nature of their competition as an argument for regulatory approval of that purchase. =Internet= At the end of 2013, Comcast and Time Warner Cable had about 20.7 million and 11.1 million internet subscribers, respectively. Together, the two companies would have controlled about two-thirds of the broadband cable market, or about 40% of the U.S. wired broadband market as a whole. Comcast noted that the combined companies' share of all U.S. broadband internet, both wired and wireless was 21.5%. However, because wireless internet is generally slower, more expensive, and has much lower data caps, the wireless comparison remains controversial. In 2010, Comcast won a lawsuit with the FCC which struck down the agency's net neutrality rules on jurisdictional grounds. As a condition of its acquisition of NBC Universal in 2011, Comcast agreed to abide by the same Open Internet rules that it argued be struck down. Because these rules would be extended to Time Warner Cable customers in the event of a merger, Comcast argued the acquisition would be a benefit for consumers. On the other hand, critics noted that the provision expires in January 2018, and questioned Comcast's record of abiding by legal mandates. =Television service= As of March 31, 2014, Comcast and Time Warner Cable had 22.6 million and 11.2 million video subscribers, respectively. Together, the two companies served about 33% of paid TV customers in the US. After the announcement of the merger, Comcast considered selling off about 3 million subscribers. This divestiture would bring Comcast's share of US TV subscribers just below 30%, a threshold that was formerly used by the FCC as a strict limit on the TV market share for one company, before Comcast successfully sued to have the rule overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in August 2009. Comcast reached a deal with Charter Communications in April 2014 to sell Charter both 1.4 million customers and a 33% stake in a company of an additional 2.5 million subscribers. =Media properties= Time Warner Cable has few media properties, most of which are local news channels such as NY1, and regional sports networks such as Time Warner Cable SportsNet and SportsNet LA. Comcast owns several similar services through NBCUniversal, including New England Cable News and Comcast SportsNet, which serve different markets from TWC's news and sports channels. Both companies also own minority stakes in SportsNet New York and MLB Network. Time Warner Cable should not be confused with Time Warner Inc. (now known as WarnerMedia), which owns Warner Bros. Entertainment (including Warner Bros. Television and a 50% stake in The CW), pay TV networks such as HBO and Cinemax, several other national cable channels such as TruTV, CNN and Cartoon Network and other properties which compete with Comcast's NBCUniversal division, but which spun off Time Warner Cable as a completely separate company in March 2009, Time Warner Inc. also spun off AOL in December 2009. Regulatory review =U.S. Congress= After initially scheduling the hearing for March 25, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the deal was held on April 9, 2014. The House Judiciary Committee also held a hearing concerning the acquisition on May 8, 2014. The congressional hearings have no direct effect on the outcome of the review process. =Federal Communications Commission= The FCC's review of the acquisition began on April 8, 2014, when Comcast filed their public interest statement. The FCC review was headed by chairman of the FCC and former cable industry lobbyist Tom Wheeler. Wheeler's appointment in May 2013 was widely praised by the cable industry. Some raised concerns about Wheeler's previous work as the head of the main U.S. cable lobby, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association. Comcast donated $110,000, and Time Warner paid $22,000 for a fundraiser benefitting Mignon Clyburn, an FCC officer. The FCC timed its review of the merger with a 180-day \\"shot clock\\", a non-binding estimate of how long it would take to come to a decision regarding the merger. The clock began on July 10, 2014, when the FCC set a deadline for comments on the merger. From October 3, 2014 to October 29, 2014, the FCC paused the clock at day 85, waiting for Comcast to submit additional information regarding their business practices. From December 22, 2014 to January 12, 2015, the FCC paused the clock at day 105, to give it time to review documents which Time Warner Cable had submitted late. On March 13, 2015 the FCC paused the clock again, waiting for court decisions regarding the public disclosure of information about companies' retransmission consent contracts. =Department of Justice= The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice officially announced that it would be reviewing the merger on March 6, 2014. Concurrent with the announcement, the current head of the antitrust at the DOJ, Bill Baer, recused himself from the review. Baer previously represented General Electric during their sale of NBCUniversal to Comcast. With Baer recused, the DOJ review was led by Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Renata B. Hesse and Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Gelfand. A group of about 25 states, through their state attorneys general, are conducting their own probes, either individually or through a multistate review group. The DOJ commonly uses the Herfindahl index (HHI) to measure market concentration, designating markets between 1,500 points and 2,500 points as \\"moderately concentrated\\" and those above 2,500 points as \\"highly concentrated\\". By some rough estimates, the merger would have increased the HHI of the US television industry from 1,815 to 2,454, or an increase in 639 points. The merger would have increased the national wired broadband HHI from roughly 1,455 to 2,130. However, the DOJ traditionally considers the effects of transactions on concentration in individual markets, in which Comcast and Time Warner do not compete, and ignores transactions' effects on the national market as a whole. Positions on the merger =Support= Comcast and its affiliates were among the strongest supporters of the deal. Comcast vice-president David Cohen stated that the deal was \\"all about increasing competition and creating more consumer benefit as a result of gaining additional scale.\\" Carl Guardino, CEO of Silicon Valley Leadership Group, which represents Comcast among other companies, said that \\"there seems to be nothing but upside in this deal\\". A coalition of libertarian groups, including Americans for Tax Reform, supported the merger in a letter calling on the FCC and DOJ to \\"allow the free market to function...without interference\\". Many of the groups which publicly supported the merger received political or charitable donations from Comcast or the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, leading some to doubt the impartiality of the statements of support. An investigation by The Verge found that some letters of support from state and local level officials were originally written by Comcast employees and forwarded to the FCC with only superficial changes. =Opposition= The merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable was widely opposed due to concerns over its impact on the overall market. It was argued that the sheer size of the combined company would reduce competition, would give Comcast an unprecedented level of control over the United States' internet and television industries. It was also argued that the merger would give Comcast increased leverage in the distribution of NBCUniversal content, hamper over-the-top services such as Netflix, and lead to higher prices for its services. Prominent critics of the deal included technology expert Susan P. Crawford, U.S. senator Al Franken of Minnesota, the city of Lexington, Kentucky,http://www.kentucky.com/2014/10/07/3468773/citys-action-could-kill- time-warner.html the city of Worcester, Massachusetts,http://www.telegram.com/article/20141015/NEWS/310159849/1116 and U.S. representative John Conyers of Michigan.Diane Bartz, U.S. lawmakers air concerns over Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal, Reuters, May 8, 2014. Some companies within the industry expressed opposition to the merger, including DirecTV, Netflix, and Cogent Communications. Prior to reaching a deal to acquire some subscribers of the merged company, Charter Communications also opposed the merger. Public opinion on the merger was generally negative. A March 2014 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 52% of Americans believed the deal was bad for consumers, while 22% thought it would be beneficial. An April 2014 poll conducted by Consumer Reports found that the merger was opposed by 56% of the public and supported by 11%, with 32% having no opinion, with 74% of respondents agreeing that a merger \\"will result in higher Internet and cable prices for everyone.\\"CR Poll: Most consumers oppose the Comcast / Time Warner cable merger (June 19, 2014), Consumers Union.Ted Johnson, Consumer Reports Poll: Majority Oppose Comcast-Time Warner Cable Merger (June 19, 2014), Variety. Comcast vice president David Cohen has pointed to faults in the company's customer service as the reason behind much of the opposition from the general public, arguing such concerns are not relevant to the government's review of the deal. A coalition of 56 consumer-advocacy and public interest groups expressed opposition to the merger, including both the Writers Guild of America, East and Writers Guild of America, West, the Media Alliance, Public Knowledge, and the Parents Television Council. Outside of this group, Consumer Watchdog also opposed the merger. Abandonment, aftermath In April 2015, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Justice was preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against Comcast and Time Warner Cable in a bid to halt the merger, arguing that the merger would reduce the level of competition in the cable television and broadband internet industries. On April 24, 2015, Comcast officially announced that it had called off the merger. Following the abandonment of the deal, it was reported that a TWC financial advisor had been in talks with representatives from Cox Communications regarding a merger; however, a Cox representative denied that they were exploring a sale, and that the company would \\"continue to explore any potential growth opportunities that align with our business objectives.\\" On May 26, 2015, Charter Communications announced a $78.7 billion deal to acquire TWC, along with a $10.1 billion deal to acquire Bright House Networks.

It acts as sorbent for binding toxic substances of various natures, pathogens and metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract and their excretion. PMSPH is a homogeneous paste-like mass of white or almost white color, odorless. History PMSPH was first synthesized in the late 1970s in the Institute of physical chemistry named after L.V. Pisarzhevsky in Kiev (I.B. Slinyakova, I.M. Samodumova). That work was based on earlier work there developing theories for the formation of porous structure of organosilicon adsorbents with adjustable pore structure and chemical nature of a given surface and studies on synthesis of organosilicon adsorbents. General information Polymethylsiloxane polyhydrate is a gelly-like polymeric organosilicon compound. The gel is dispersed in water to a particle size less than 300 microns in suspension. =Microstructure= Electron microscopical studies have revealed that the gel-forming matrix has a globular structure and consists of an ensemble of fused globules. The globules bound with siloxane linkages form pores. The pores are spaces between the globules filled with water. The pore sizes are restricted. Sorption isotherms for hexane and methanol show that the adsorbent has a mesoporous structure. Presence of methyl groups on the surface provides their hydrophobic properties. PMSPH particles tend to form a continuous network in the suspension to reduce interaction of the hydrophobic groups SiCH3 with water. These particles can be viewed as 2D sheets rather than 3D solids. Aqueous suspensions of polymethylsiloxane polyhydrate are characterized by high viscosity. Mechanism of action PMSPH is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted unchanged within 12 hours. A robust porous structure of the gel-forming matrix determines absorptive capacity of the mechanism of molecular adsorption and allows mostly to adsorb toxic substances and metabolites (e.g., bilirubin, protein breakdown products). Thanks to its gelly-like consistency, PMSPH: * absorbs macromolecular toxic substances by a mechanism of precipitation in the gel (e.g., bacterial toxins); * exhibits protective properties - elastic gelly-like drug particles form a layer on the mucosal surfaces. This layer protects the mucous membranes from exposure to various damaging factors, while its protective properties are manifested universally - in the intestine and on the mucosal surface of other organs. PMSPH absorbs toxic substances from the gastrointestinal tract as well as toxic substances (xenobiotics) trapped in the gastro-intestinal tract, from the surrounding environment. PMSPH also prevents reabsorption of toxins and metabolites spun into the lumen of the blood as well as transferred to the intestine with bile. PMS PH firmly binds and removes pathogenic bacteria. PMSPH possesses a pronounced ability to absorb lipopolysaccharide molecules. Large lipopolysaccharide molecules coprecipitate in the gel and are excreted. A daily dose of PMSPH binds 410 mg of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which has an extremely high biological activity. LPS can be found in the outer wall of gram-negative bacteria and is released only when the bacteria are destroyed, hence it is also called endotoxin (endo means \\"inside\\", inside the bacteria). The main reservoir of gram-negative microflora and lipopolysaccharide is the distal intestine. Effectiveness of Enterosgel was proven in trials.

The original picture showed workers supporting the pyramid on their backs, with the stanza: \\"The time will come when the people in their fury will straighten their bent backs and bring down the structure with one mighty push of their shoulders.\\" Notable differences between the Russian 1900 original and the American 1911 derivative version include the replacement of the Russian Empire's black eagle with a money bag, the Russian tsar and tsarina with a more generic trio of figures (a monarch and state leaders in suits), two of the three Orthodox clergy with a Catholic cardinal and a Protestant minister, and the Russian Empire army with a more generic group of soldiers; the workers are no longer bent and no revolutionary stanza is present. On both pictures, a fallen child or child worker symbolizes the plight of the workers. Another shared element is a red flag raised amongst the workers, symbolizing the emergence of the socialist movement. The basic message of the image is the critique of the capitalist system, with its hierarchy of power and wealth. It illustrates that the working class is supporting all others, and if it would withdraw their support from the system it could topple the existing social order. This type of criticism of capitalism is attributed to the French socialist Louis Blanc.

He became Captain when his uncle and stepfather David Christian Frederiks was killed in 1880 in the Battle of Otjikango. Frederiks was party to a land sale deal between the Bethanie Orlam and German merchant Adolf L√ºderitz that would eventually establish Imperial Germany colony of German South-West Africa. L√ºderitz in May 1883 obtained the area of Angra Pequena (today the town of L√ºderitz) from Frederiks for 100¬£ in gold and 200 rifles. Three months later on 25 August, Frederiks sold L√ºderitz a stretch of land wide, between the Orange River and Angra Pequena, for ¬£500 and 60 rifles.

Both L√ºderitz and the signing witness, Rhenish missionary Johannes Bam, knew that Chief Frederiks had no idea about geographical miles. He was only concerned about fertile land, and the shore of the Atlantic Ocean was of no value to his tribe. When Frederiks finally became aware of the size of the land he sold, he complained to the German Imperial Government, but Consul- General Gustav Nachtigal died on his return voyage, and the complaint was never delivered. In 1887 \\"even the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office doubted the validity of the treaty\\". In the wake of the land deal, Frederiks on 28 October 1884 also signed a protection treaty with the German Empire, the second of its kind in German South-West Africa, after the treaty with the Rehoboth Basters two weeks prior.

Left to right: guitarist Jonny Wickersham, Gary Tovar of Goldenvoice Productions, singer/guitarist Shawn Stern, drummer Mark Stern, and bassist Adam Stern. Gary Tovar is known as a music promoter and marijuana smuggler in the US. He named his music concert business Goldenvoice Productions, after a strain of marijuana that users said gave them a feeling of being spoken to by angels. Tovar is no longer involved with smuggling but acts as a consultant to Goldenvoice, which now operates the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival that has been compared to the Glastonbury Festival and is the most profitable music festival in the US. Early life and drug trafficking  Tovar was born in Los Angeles and began smuggling illicit goods as a 14-year-old when he brought fireworks into the US from Tijuana in Mexico. Influenced by someone referred to as LaRue, who was connected to Timothy Leary's The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, Tovar's involvement with marijuana began in the late 1960s, with his sources for the seeds that he distributed including US servicemen on furlough from the Vietnam War. His organization was such that he was able to guarantee a market and a distribution network for the growers to whom he sold the seeds. The strains that he imported included Thai stick and Acapulco Gold. He earned many millions of dollars before being arrested by federal drug agents on March 9, 1991. He fought conspiracy charges from Los Angeles County Jail before being imprisoned in October 1992 for seven years on four counts relating to trafficking from Arizona.  Music promotion  Tovar's interest in music promotion developed in 1981, when his younger sister told him that the police were stifling the development of punk rock music in southern California. This was three years after he and his sister had attended the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco to see the last concert performed by the Sex Pistols. The punk rock genre was not popular with promoters or authorities, mainly because of its association with violence, but Tovar believes that \\"We had every right to perform and every right to this culture\\" and he was not perturbed when put under pressure by the police. He considered punk to be the successor to the ageing hippie ethos and he caught an anti- establishment adolescent wave, saying that \\"The hippies were getting old and turning into yuppies. They behaved toward their children as their parents had to them.\\" The business was at first called Golden Voice, with the words later being concatenated. By now splitting his time between homes in Santa Barbara and Huntington Beach, Tovar promoted his first show in Santa Barbara on December 4, 1981. That featured the US bands T.S.O.L., Shattered Faith and Rhino 39. Basing his Goldenvoice business in Huntington Beach, he gained a reputation for being an atypical promoter: he did not rip off the performers, paying them reasonable rates for their work and thus soon became influential in the business in California. He also had influence beyond the state through his booking agency, which assisted bands such as The Vandals and Social Distortion in their national breakthroughs. In 1982, Tovar visited Britain on a scouting mission and eventually, using money obtained through his smuggling operations, he financed shows in Los Angeles by British punk bands such as the Anti-Nowhere League, The Damned, GBH, Public Image Ltd and Siouxsie and the Banshees. A highlight was a series of monthly concerts involving international punk bands held at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in the years around the time of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. His shows there, which featured groups including the Dead Kennedys and Bad Religion, were priced cheaply and attracted over 4000 fans, twice as many as were attending similar events in New York City. His promotions were ultimately loss-making ‚Äî he estimates his losses at between three and four million dollars over a ten-year period ‚Äî but they did provide a means for him to launder money from the illegal drug business. He has said that The Olympic Auditorium shows ended in 1985 as interest waned but Goldenvoice moved successfully into other venues such as the John Anson Ford Theater, where tickets for concert by The Ramones were sold for 5. The business promoted some of the first concerts by bands such as Nirvana and Red Hot Chili Peppers, expanding beyond punk to be in the vanguard of the speed metal, Goth and alternative music movements. In 1986, he had met and employed Paul Tollett, an upcoming ska promoter; a year earlier, he had employed Rick Van Santen, who managed 45 Grave. Tovar pulled out of the music venture in 1991 and has cited the losses and the increased levels of violence as his rationale. There had been, for example, three major riots at promotions in 1983. Now facing the trafficking charges, Tovar signed the business over to Tollett and Van Santen free of charge. Goldenvoice launched the Coachella festival in 1999. Tollett and Tovar remain friends, and Tovar attends Coachella every year as well as operating the \\"Tovar and Otis\\" hand made merch tent with his long time artist and merch partner Bad Otis Link. Tovar also remains a consultant to the company; Van Santen died in 2003.  Later life  Tovar now has a medical marijuana card. He is sometimes called an Anglophile and is no longer involved in illegal activities, describing his current interests as \\"English fun\\". He believes that the present-day movement towards legalization of marijuana in the US and the fact that music from punks such as The Ramones is played in such commonplace settings as elevators vindicates his past maverick activities. He organised a multi-night festival called GV30 at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in December 2011 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Goldenvoice. This event caused Black Flag to begin performing again.

The new captain lived a great part of his life in the captaincy, and was recognized for the stability and security of his government, something that was lacking in his father and grandfather's administration. The most prominent occurrence of his regime occurred in 1616, when the neighbouring island of Santa Maria was attacked by Barbary coast pirates, Vila do Porto completely sacked and its inhabitants sold into slavery in Northern Africa. This episode gave origin to the Confraria dos Escravos da Cadeinha (the brotherhood of the slaves of Cadeinha). D. Manuel attempted to alleviate the concern of Marienses, even as little was accomplished by the national administration to relieve their suffering.

Hansika revealed that she would play a girl with a \\"futuristic attitude\\", while Jayam Ravi's character would be more conservative in the romantic comedy. The film's first official poster released on 14 April 2014 coinciding with Tamil New Years Day and indicated that filming had begun. The team held their first schedule in May 2014, with Poonam Bajwa joining the cast.

Release  The satellite rights of the film were sold to Sun TV. = Critical reception = Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"The film is a disaster...it's impossible to digest the overall preposterousness...Romeo Juliet just cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be a screwball comedy or a melodrama ‚Äî the tone is all over the place. And the writing is painfully inconsistent\\". The Times of India gave the film 2/5 and wrote, \\"here is a film that could prove to be a worthy challenger to Valiyavan for the title of the Most Preposterous Movie of the Year. Rediff also gave it 2/5 and wrote, \\"Lakshman's Romeo Juliet is just a rehash of old clich√©s. He pitches love against money and there are no prizes for guessing which one wins\\". Sify wrote, \\"Lakshman has packaged the film in a glossy manner but it is unable to find any spark or chemistry between the lead pair. His direction is amateurish and so are the characters half-baked. The best thing about Romeo Juliet is Jayam Ravi and Hansika who does their best to rise above the flawed script\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"The film, an average entertainer, would have been more engaging if only the screenplay had been coherent and the episodes interesting\\".

He is cousin of Vasily Lukich Dolgorukov. Biography Dolgorukov's birth date is unknown. From 1700 to 1706 he lived in Warsaw and travelled to Italy. The nobility of his father Grigory Fyodorovich and uncle Yakov Fyodorovich made it quite easily for Alexey to work on different services. In 1713 he became governor of Smolensk, in 1723 president of the Main Municipality and in 1726, after an appeal by Alexander Danilovich Menshikov, was named senator and hofmeister by Catherine I. Dolgorukov was the second educator of Grand Duke Peter Alexeyevich Romanov. Under Peter II Dolgorukov became a member of the Supreme Privy Council. He tried to recover Peter II's rule while being against Menshikov. Finally, latter was exiled in Beryozov of the Tobolsk Governorate. As he endeavoured to go by Peter II, he distracted him from works, encouraging him in chases and other enjoyments. He often sent him to his manor in the region behind Moscow in Gorenky, where only family members of the Dolgorukovs were near him. Here the 14-year-old Emperor met with one of Alexey's daughters, Ekaterina, who became engaged with Peter II. After the death of Peter II, he was the only member of the Supreme Privy Council who protested against the accession of Anna, leading him and his family being exiled to Beryozov, where he died in 1734. Personal life His father, Grigory Fyodorovich (1657 - 1723), was house stolnik of Peter I. His mother, Praskovya Yuryevna Khilkova, was the daughter of Yuri Yakovlevich Khilkov (1682 - 1730) and Yevdokia Petrovna Neledinskaya. Alexey's children were: *Ivan (1708 - 1739): favorite of Emperor Peter II, capitally punished. From 1730 was in marriage with countess Natalya Borisovna Sheremetyeva; *–ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ (1712 - 1747): fianc√©e of Emperor Peter II. From 1745 wife of count Alexander Romanovich Bryus (Bruce); *Nikolay (1713 - 1790): in first marriage with Natalya Sergeyevna Golitsyna (1715 - 1755), in second marriage with Anna Aleksandrovna Bredikhina (1733 - 1808); *Elena (1715 - 1799): in marriage with knyaz Yuri Yuryevich Dolgorukov (died 1746); *Anna (died 1758); *Alexey (1716 - 1792): in first marriage with Yevdokia Grigoryevna Myshetskova from 1756 (died 1760).

It replaced the King's Medal for Bravery, Silver and Queen's Medal for Bravery, Silver, the award of which was discontinued in South Africa in 1961.South African Medal Website - Republic of South Africa: 1967-2002 (Accessed 1 May 2015) Institution The Woltemade Decoration for Bravery, Silver was instituted by the Republic of South Africa in 1970, by Warrant of 20 May 1970, published in Government Gazette no. 2718 dated 29 May 1970. The Warrant was amended twice, on 11 November 1971 and 30 May 1973, to expand the eligibility for award. It is the lesser of two classes of South Africa's highest civilian decoration for bravery and it replaced and ranked on par with the King's and Queen's Medals for Bravery, Silver, the award of which was discontinued upon the establishment of the Republic of South Africa on 31 May 1961. The decoration was named in memory of Wolraad Woltemade, an elderly servant of the Dutch East India Company, who gave his life while rescuing shipwrecked sailors in Table Bay on 1 June 1773. The ship De Jonge Thomas broke anchor in a gale force Northwestern and was driven ashore in the Salt River Mouth. Woltemade rode his horse into the sea seven times and brought surviving sailors ashore each time, but on the eighth excursion Woltemade and his exhausted horse were overladen by panic-stricken sailors and drowned. Award criteria The Woltemade Decoration for Bravery, Silver could be awarded to South African citizens who performed acts of conspicuous bravery within or beyond the borders of the Republic of South Africa. The eligibility for award was subsequently expanded to non-citizens who have distinguished themselves in this manner in the Republic or in territories belonging to or administered by the Republic, or who elsewhere and in the face of extreme danger have saved the lives of South African citizens or protected property belonging to the Republic, or endeavoured to do so. The decoration was, like the earlier King's and Queen's Medals for Bravery, Silver, mainly intended for civilians and its award to members of the uniformed services was restricted to acts of gallantry for which the decorations of the services are not normally awarded. Order of wear The position of the Woltemade Decoration for Bravery, Silver in the official national order of precedence was revised three times after 1990 to accommodate the inclusion or institution of new decorations and medals, first with the integration process of 1994, again when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted in April 1996 for the two former non-statutory para- military forces, the Azanian People's Liberation Army and Umkhonto we Sizwe, and again with the institution of new sets of awards in 2002 and 2003, but it remained unchanged on all three occasions.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, * Preceded by the Louw Wepener Decoration (LWD). * Succeeded by the South African Police Cross for Bravery (PCF).Republic of South Africa Government Gazette no. 15093, Pretoria, 3 September 1993 Description ;Obverse The decoration was struck in silver and is 38 millimetres in diameter with a raised rim and a large ring suspender. The obverse depicts Wolraad Woltemade on his horse in the waves, with the words \\"FOR BRAVERY ‚Ä¢ VIR DAPPERHEID\\" around the perimeter at the top. This was the same design as used on the earlier King's and Queen's Medals for Bravery, Silver. ;Reverse The reverse depicts the crest of the South African Coat of Arms, a lion holding four staves to represent the four provinces of the Republic of South Africa.

They are regarded as terrorist groups by the Government of Ukraine. The Donbass People's Militia was formed by Pavel Gubarev, who was elected \\"People's Governor\\" of Donetsk Oblast by a mob of pro-Russian protesters. It was originally involved in taking control of Ukrainian government buildings in the Donetsk Oblast. Tensions increased to the point of the militia being actively involved in fighting a war against the Ukrainian government in the Donbass region of Ukraine. The militia was accused by the Ukrainian government of culpability in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on 17 July 2014, but the Donetsk People's Republic disputed this claim. The militias of the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic merged into one group on 16 September 2014, forming the \\"United Armed Forces of Novorossiya\\". It is widely believed that the separatists are supported by the Russian Armed Forces. Ukraine conflict: Deadly flare-up on eastern front line, BBC News (18 February 2020) Although the Russian government often denies direct involvement stating that their soldiers were there voluntarily and not under orders, some of them were detained riding their combat vehicles with documents proving their origin in Russian armed forces. A college director at the Donetsk Academy of Motor Transport living under the Donetsk People's Republic has been sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for taking pictures of Russian vehicles in Eastern Ukraine, under the accounts of \\"spying\\". Moreover, separatists admitted receiving supplies from Russia and being trained there. BBC reported that separatist ranks are composed of thousands of Russian citizens, and NATO accused Russia of deploying their regular troops into Ukraine. Registered Cossacks of the Russian Federation have been reported to be supporting separatists in the conflict as well. Head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko claimed in August 2014 that there are around 3,000 to 4,000 Russian volunteers fighting for the militia, which includes current and many retired Russian Army servicemen.Around 3-4 thousand Russian volunteers fighting for Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic militia.

History  Pro-Russian rally in Donetsk on April 6, 2014 On 3 March 2014, during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, groups of protesters took control of the regional administration building in Donetsk. A newly created armed opposition group named the Donbass People's Militia participated in it and was led by Pavel Gubarev. This happened when 11 Ukrainian cities with significant populations of ethnic Russians erupted in demonstrations against the new Ukrainian government. On 6 April 2014, 2,000 pro-Russian protesters rallied outside the regional administration building. On the same day, groups of protesters in Eastern Ukraine stormed the regional administration building in Kharkiv, and the SBU headquarters in Luhansk. The groups created a people's council and demanded a referendum like in Crimea. Within a few days, several government buildings in cities such as Kramatorsk and Sloviansk were also stormed. On 12 April, the supporters of the Donetsk People's Republic and members of Donbass People's Militia set up checkpoints and barricades in Sloviansk.–ù–∞ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–º –∏–∑ –±–ª–æ–∫–ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤ –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ –°–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–∞ —Å–ª—ã—à–Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª—å–±–∞ –∏ –≤–∑—Ä—ã–≤—ã // \\"–ü–µ—Ä–≤—ã–π –∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª\\" –æ—Ç 13 –∞–ø—Ä–µ–ª—è 2014 The same day, former members of the Donetsk \\"Berkut\\" unit joined the ranks of the Donbass People's Militia.¬´–≠—Ç–æ –Ω–∞—à–∏ –ª—é–¥–∏¬ª // ¬´–í–∑–≥–ª—è–¥.RU¬ª –æ—Ç 12 –∞–ø—Ä–µ–ª—è 2014 On 13 April, the newly established Ukrainian government gave the separatists a deadline to disarm or face a \\"full-scale anti-terrorist campaign\\" in the region.

However, the rebels were also seen using weapons that were not known to be exported to or otherwise available in Ukraine. Appearance of some of the latest models of Russian military equipment, which was never exported outside of Russia, is particularly noteworthy. According to the Donetsk People's Republic, all its military equipment is \\"hardware that we took from the Ukrainian military\\". However, according to the Ukrainian government and the United States Department of State, this is a false statement and claim the separatists have received military equipment from Russia, including multiple rocket launch systems and tanks. Despite the fact that Russian officials deny supplying arms to the militia, numerous evidence proves that it is true. In August 2014 Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeriy Heletey claimed the proof for the weapons supply from Russia was that the fighters of the Donbass People's Militia were using Russian-made weapons that were never used (or bought) by the Ukrainian army.Militants have Russian weapons that have never been in service with Ukrainian army - Heletei, Interfax-Ukraine (22 August 2014) Among such exclusively Russian equipment seen with pro-Russian separatists are Russian modifications of tank T-72 (particularly T-72B3 and T-72BA seen destroyed in Ukraine), infantry fighting vehicle BTR-82AM (adopted in Russia in 2013), armored personnel carriers BPM-97, sophisticated anti-aircraft system Pantsir-S1, multipurpose vehicle GAZ Vodnik (adopted in Russia in 2005), Russian modifications of MT-LB, rocket-propelled flamethrower MRO-A, anti-tank missile Kornet, anti-materiel rifle ASVK, suppressed sniper rifle VSS Vintorez and others.

Reviews emphasize Miller's technique and formal concerns as much as her content, in particular, noting her expressive, varied brushwork, idiosyncratic color, and sense of light and pattern. Arts Magazine suggested that her interest in animal subjects resulted as much from the opportunities to \\"exploit the sensuality, physicality, and tactility of the painted surface\\" as emotional, visual and allegorical concerns; ARTnews observed that her paintings display a \\"remarkable conjunction of baroque composition\\"‚Äîrecalling tumultuous hunting scenes by Delacroix, Rubens, and da Vinci‚Äîand Abstract Expressionist immediacy with regard to gesture, color and surface. Work Miller‚Äôs figurative paintings and drawings of the later 1970s arose out of her affinity for rural Texas and New Mexico environments and behavioral observation, and often portrayed lively, high-colored, seemingly ordinary farm vignettes (barnyard scenes, picnics) featuring both animals and people.Sterling, Susan Fisher. \\"Melissa Miller,\\" Women Artists: The National Museum of Women in the Arts, New York: Abbeville Press, 1997.

By 1985, the looser, more Rubenesque animals of Miller's early work had given way to tighter, more realistic protagonists. These animals interacted with humanoids and mythological or fictional characters (angels, demons, spirits) in fantastical scenarios inspired by Eastern and Western folk tales (e.g., Aesop's Crow, 1985) that emphasized a psychological focus on inner states and existential dilemmas rather than external observation. Representative, allegorical works of this period include Broken Wing (1986), New Skin (1988), Decision (1991) and Night Sky (1995), which respectively depict mortal crisis, spontaneous metamorphosis, a phantasmagorical procession of creatures, and flight in the midst of environmental catastrophe. Reacting to disappearing natural habitats and the increasing number of imported species that she observed in Texas and the Southwest, Miller shifted from fantastical and mythic scenes to tableaux combining farm and exotic animals in her paintings and drawings of the early 2000s.Chavarria, Albert Jesus. \\"Melissa Miller: Recent Work,\\" Artlies, Winter 2002‚Äì3, p. 80‚Äì1 These paintings conveyed wary, almost-lazy calm and indifference and alluded to tenuous relationships among strangers, immigration, alienation, harmony and integration (e.g., Farm, 2002; Cluster, 2003). This work often employed rigorously structured, frieze-like compositions of flattened landscapes rather than illusionistic space, which reviewers compared to Japanese screens and Persian miniatures, Giorgio Morandi still lifes, and pre-Renaissance groupings of people. Melissa Miller, Forest Fire, oil on canvas, 65\\" x 100\\", 2019. Continuing to narrate from an observational position. Miller's later work has a more urgent ecological focus that portrays transitioning and despoiled land- and seascapes, shrinking wilderness habitats, displaced animal and human populations, and resulting, new patterns of behavior and migration. For example, Forest Fire (2019) depicts deer and birds fleeing a cataclysmic inferno; other works, such as Moth (2016) and Ghost Net (2013), show rare and other land species or sea life endangered by human activity. Reviewers suggest that in this later work, Miller's interest in Asian art is more evident, both in her experimentation with perspective and portrayal of animals, which is less anthropomorphic and metaphorical and more straight-forward. Since 2017, Miller has also created realistic, three-dimensional animal works in clay and silhouette-like, laser- cut metal landscape and animal works exploring similar themes.Melissa Miller website.

Definition  Chris Flaherty in 2003 distinguished the concept of command and influence is a component of Military C2 ('command and control'), in the following terms: \\"Influence, is fundamental to effective Command where forces manoeuvre. Thus, recognition of \\"Influence\\" is an important element in any future warfighting concept. As an alternative to relying on Command and Control (C2) based effective Command there should be utilization of command and \\"influence\\" (CI) based effective Command.Flaherty, C.J. (2003) The Role of Command and Influence in Australian Multidimensional Manoeuvre Theory, Defence Force Journal. (162): 31-38. URL: http://www.adfjournal.adc.edu.au/UserFiles/issues/162%202003%20Sep_Oct.pdf Flaherty, C. (2010) Command, Influence and Information in 3D Tactics. Journal of Information Warfare. (9)1: 18-31.  Role of influence in military theory  Notionally, 'influence' is definable as the effect of one person or thing on another.Flaherty, C. (2010) Command, Influence and Information in 3D Tactics. Journal of Information Warfare. (9)1: 18-31. In particular military information operations (IO) implicitly incorporates a variety of influence strategies, in order to shape the military and political spheres in conflict.  Relevance of Arquilla and Ronfeldt work  The work of John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, on the netwar actor,Arquilla,J. Ronfeldt, D.F. (1996) The Advent of Netwar. RAND, Santa Monica, CA. was used as the basis for developing the 'command and influence' model. In particular, their characterization of the network based organisation, as these routinely employ non-hierarchical based decision structures: * An archetypal netwar actor consists of a web (or network) of disperse, interconnected 'nodes' (or activity centres). * A network based organisation is structurally flat, meaning there is no single central leader or commander, and with little or no hierarchy. * Decision making and operations are decentralized and depend on consultative consensus- building that allow for local initiative and autonomy. * A mobilizing factor for decision making depends on a powerful doctrine, ideology, or narrative. This later dictum clearly identifies 'Influence' as the enabling mechanism allowing actors/agents to disperse, devote to different tasks, as well as coordinate from a ground level up emulating operational centrality.  Relationship swarming tactics  Swarming attackers or defenders take advantage of any happenstance they can manipulate (to their own advantage); and are able to overcome coordination barriers, as these adopt the following strategies:Flaherty, C. (2012) Dangerous Minds: A Monograph on the Relationship Between Beliefs ‚ÄìBehaviours ‚Äì Tactics. Published by OODA LOOP (7 September 2012). URL: http://www.oodaloop.com/security/2012/09/07/dangerous- minds-the-relationship-between-beliefs-behaviors-and-tactics/ * There is no discernible communication between swarming attackers (who operate completely without organisation or an apparent plan). * Netwar organisation is described as structurally flat. There is no central leader or commander and little or no hierarchy.  Cohesive factors  The key command and influence cohesive factors, are: * Actions are independent; * Coordinated collaboratively and consultatively; * 'Influence' operates as the attractor and motivator for human-to-human organisation; * The swarmers rely on broad ideologies to motivate and direct (which operate as unifying and directing precepts); and, * The swarmers rely on opinion leaders or intermediaries, who organize, coordinate, and suggest direction.

Having participated in the 1940 Norwegian Campaign, opposing the German invasion of Norway, he later served with the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile, commanding No. 5 Norwegian Troop of the No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.  Personal life  Hauge was born in Bergen, a son of J√∏rgen Ingjeldsen Hauge and Randi Urheim. He had his schooling at Bergen Cathedral School. He married Margaret Gerrard Watt Burnett from Scotland in 1942; the couple had a son in 1943.M√∏ller 1959: p. 524. Hauge died in 1989. Pre-World War II In 1934‚Äì35, Hauge studied at and graduated from the Norwegian field artillery's officer school.Gamst 1998: pp. 203, 211. Following his first round of military studies, he studied social economics in 1935‚Äì37. In 1937 he began two years of studies at the Norwegian Military Academy, becoming a lieutenant serving in the Kongsberg and Bergen anti-aircraft command in 1939.M√∏ller 1959: p. 165.  World War II  During the Norwegian Campaign in 1940, Hauge took part in the defence of Rjukan from 9 April onwards.Johnsen 1956: p. 101 He had recently graduated from the Norwegian Military Academy as an anti-aircraft officer, and, as a lieutenant, commanded an improvised heavy machine gun company fighting at Rjukan until the forces there were dissolved on 3 May 1940, following the Allied evacuation from southern and central Norway.Haga 1984: p. 19Johnsen 1956: pp. 116‚Äì173 Although Rjukan and the entire county of Telemark had been considered by the Norwegian military leadership as having no strategic value, it was nonetheless defended following requests by the Allies, who wanted the heavy water production facilities at Rjukan defended against the advancing German forces.Johnsen 1956: pp. 84, 289 After the end of the fighting in Rjukan, Hauge attempted to make his way through neutral Sweden to the areas in Northern Norway still controlled by Norway, but was handed over to the Germans by Swedish officials. Having been held as a prisoner by the Germans in Trondheim until June 1940, he made contact with the resistance movement later in 1940.Haga 1984: p. 20 He was arrested in December 1940,Ottosen 2004: P. 292 due to the discovery of a resistance group by the Germans, but was released shortly before Christmas, on parole with the obligation to report to the German occupiers.Haga 1984: pp. 19 Fearing further consequences, he decided to escape to Sweden. Here he was given tickets to travel the \\"long way\\" to Britain: aircraft to Moscow, by train to Odessa, by boat over the Black Sea, then by ship from Suez around the Cape of Good Hope to the Atlantic Ocean, finally ending up in Glasgow in September 1941. In Great Britain he joined the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile, where he served as second-in-command of Company 4 of the Norwegian Brigade.Haga 1984: pp. 20‚Äì22 In June 1942 two infantry platoons from this company were sent to a shock troops training course at Fort William.Fj√¶rli 1982: p. 186. In August 1942 Hauge was given the command of No. 5 Norwegian Troop of the No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando,van der Bijl 2006: p. 8. with the rank of captain. Hauge was authorized to select volunteers from the whole Norwegian Brigade, but with the core from Company 4 which recently had undergone the shock troops training course. The unit was initially based in Nefyn in Wales, and underwent a standard three-week Commando Hardening Course in Achnacarry before they were accepted as commandos.Fj√¶rli 1982: pp. 187‚Äì188. In January 1943 a detachment from the troop participated in Operation Cartoon, an attack on the pyrite mines of Stord√∏ Kisgruber at Litlab√∏ near Sagv√•g in Stord, Norway.Haga 1984: pp. 47‚Äì69 From May 1943 the unit was based in Eastbourne and went through intensive training in preparation for landing operations. From January 1944 they were stationed in Shetland, where they took part in raids to the Norwegian coast, and in June they moved back to Eastbourne. Hauge's unit took part in the Battle of the Scheldt, in particular the Operation Infatuate, the victorious attack on Walcheren in November 1944.Fj√¶rli 1982Haga 1984: pp. 107‚Äì143Melien 1979 Hauge's report from the attack on Walcheren is reprinted in Eystein Fj√¶rli's book from 1982.

While recuperating, Hauge was awarded the British Military Cross for his leadership during the Walcheren battle.van der Bijl 2006: p. 59. In January 1945, No. 5 Norwegian Troop took part in the attack on the island Kapelsche Veer, along with No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando. This attack was not an immediate success, but the island was conquered by Canadian troops a few weeks later.Fj√¶rli 1982: p. 191.Haga 1984: pp. 159‚Äì168 After the first Norwegian assault against the German lines had resulted in more than 50% casualties, Hauge had called off the renewed attacks ordered by No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando. No. 5 Norwegian Troop saw no further fighting during the war after the Kapelsche Veer attack, being instead sent to officially neutral Sweden on 1 May 1945. On 9 May 1945, eight days after arriving in Sweden, Hauge led No. 5 Norwegian Troop over the border to Norway to take part in the disarming of the surrendered German forces there. When Crown Prince Olav returned to Norway on 13 May, No. 5 Norwegian Troop formed his guard of honour.van der Bijl 2006: pp. 57‚Äì58.

A museum dedicated to her work has been opened near Berlin. Life Hedwig Bollhagen was raised in a one-parent family in Hanover,Hugo Thielen: Bollhagen, Hedwig, in: Hannoversches Biographisches Lexikon, p. 64 where she attended a girl's secondary school. After graduating from this school in 1924, she completed an internship in a pottery in Gro√üalmerode in the same year. After her guest studies at the Staatliche Kunstakademie (State Art Academy) in Kassel, she studied at the Fachschule H√∂hr-Grenzhausen, a technical school for ceramics, under Eduard Berdel and Hermann Bollenbach from spring of 1925 until summer of 1927. In 1926, she became a trainee in the Hamelner T√∂pferei (pottery) of Gertrud Kraut in Hameln. From 1927 to 1931, she worked as a designer and head of the painting department at the stoneware factories Steingutfabriken Velten-Vordamm in Velten.Paul Dahms: Velten, Ein Streifzug durch die Geschichte der Ofenstadt, Veltener Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, , p. 78 After their closure due to a drop in exports as a result of the Great Depression, she began traveling: she first worked at the State Majolica Factory in Karlsruhe, then at the Rosenthal factories in Coburg, the workshop of Wilhelm Kagel in Garmisch-Partenkirchen (until the spring of 1932) and finally, as a \\"shop girl\\" in the \\"Kunst und Handwerk\\" (\\"Art and Craft\\") sales gallery led by Tilly Prill-Schloemann and Bruno Paul in Berlin until February 1933. Until October 1933, she worked in the glazing and painting department of J. Kalscheuer Cie. Steinzeugwerke m.b.H. in Frechen. A butter dish shows the style of her work. When ceramist Nora Herz, who was based in Cologne, learned of the failed resettlement of the Ha√´l Workshops for Artistic Ceramics, founded by ceramist Margarete Heymann and her husband Gustav Loebenstein, Hedwig Bollhagen was able to found the new HB-Werkst√§tten f√ºr Keramik GmbH (HB Workshops for Ceramics) in the old ceramics factory in Velten in 1934 with the help of German politician Heinrich Schild and the participation of Margarete Heymann and Nora Herz. They established themselves with the aid of ceramics master Thoma Countess Grote as a commercial assistant and developer ‚Äì she had developed glazes for Charles Crodel ‚Äì and former employees of the ceramics workshop of Bauhaus under Gerhard Marcks such as Theodor Bogler and Werner Burri. The ceramic workshop had emerged from the Steingutfabriken Velten- Vordamm GmbH stoneware factories which were shut down in 1931. In 1935, Charles Crodel added the field of building ceramics to the company and, at the same time, brought to bear his industrial experience in decor development that he gained in the United Lusatian Glassworks when working together with Wilhelm Wagenfeld. In 1939, Hedwig Bollhagen passed her master exam with a vessel painted by Charles Crodel. She became a ceramics master and was able to free the business from the grip of the German Labour Front (DAF), the National Socialist trade union organisation. After the Second World War, Heinrich Schild, the main opponent of the DAF and co-founder and unpaid manager of the HB-Werkst√§tten returned to the Rhineland and Hedwig Bollhagen took over the running of the company single-handedly.The perception of the founding of the company by a literary scholar who was friendly with the descendants of Margarete Heymann-Loebenstein-Marks as \\"Aryanization\\" under the leadership of Heinrich Schild is based on a comparison between the HB-Werkst√§tten and the Jewish Claims of 1992, which is based on the recognition in 1961 of Grete Loebenstein as a victim of National Socialist persecution and the subsequent compensation of 1985 ‚Äì whereby the dispossessed and thus state-owned HB- Werkst√§tten were, at this time, subject to the sovereignty of the GDR. In 1939, Hedwig Bollhagen passed the master examination with a vessel painted by Charles Crodel (1894‚Äì1973). After the end of the World War II, Heinrich Schild moved from the former Soviet occupation zone to West Germany in 1946. Hedwig Bollhagen then assumed sole responsibility for the management of the HB- Werkst√§tten.For more information on H.

Her successor was Heidi Manthey, a former student of Charles Crodel, who Hedwig Bollhagen had worked with since founding the company. Hedwig Bollhagen achieved international fame through her simple, timeless everyday crockery, which, in their form and d√©cor, succeeded in achieving an informal combination of peasant tradition and Bauhaus aesthetics. She herself said: ‚ÄûArt? Oh yes, that's what some people call it. I make plates, cups and jugs.‚Äú Or more succinctly: ‚ÄûThey're just pots!\\". Hedwig Bollhagen was buried in the municipal cemetery of the St√∂cken district of Hanover.knerger.de: Das Grab von Hedwig Bollhagen Bollhagen's work was criticised by the East German head of state Walter Ulbricht, who considered her designs too formal and cosmopolitan.Hedwig Bollhagen, FormGuide.de, retrieved 13 April 2014 Her job as artistic director of her pottery was taken by Heidi Manthey, a former pupil of Bollhagen's friend Charles Crodel.

Bollhager's ceramic company,HB-Werkst√§tten f√ºr Keramik, is still in operation. , HB-Werkst√§tten f√ºr Keramik, retrieved 14 April 2014 In 2004, the estate of Hedwig Bollhagen was entered into the list of monuments of the Federal State of Brandenburg as a movable monument under the auspices of the Brandenburg State Office for Monument Protection. For the benefit of this academic estate, her heirs established the Hedwig Bollhagen Foundation as a fiducial foundation in the charge of the German Foundation for Monument Protection. It was supposed to be exhibited in the \\"Im G√ºldenen Arm\\" museum building in Potsdam as of summer of 2008. However, the opening of the planned museum was postponed after differences in opinion between the Hedwig Bollhagen Foundation and Hedwig Bollhagen Society on the one hand and the city of Potsdam on the other.Centre for Contemporary History PotsdamPress report of the DSD (memento dated 11 September 2011 in Internet Archive)‚ÄûOberb√ºrgermeister Jakobs macht Bollhagen zur Chefsache‚Äú In Potsdamer Neueste Nachrichten, 26 March 2009 Triggered by an article in the rbb magazine Kontraste,search in the web archives: Hedwig Bollhagen ‚Äì Die umstrittenen Anf√§nge. In Kontraste, 7 February 2008 there was an intensified media debate in early 2008 regarding the extent to which Hedwig Bollhagen was the deliberate beneficiary of the so- called \\"Aryanization\\" of the Ha√´l workshops. The Jewish Claims Conference continues to abide by the 1981 compensation regime and confirms that the State Office responsible for settling still open property issues has denied that the sale was related to the persecution rife at the time.Harry Nut: Kratzen am Keramik-Denkmal. In: Frankfurter Rundschau, 19 March 2008 Potsdam's Lord Mayor Jann Jakobs commissioned a study at the Centre for Contemporary History of Potsdam (ZZF) to examine whether a planned permanent exhibition of ceramics by Hedwig Bollhagen could still be held in the municipal \\"Haus im G√ºldenen Arm\\". Historian Simone Ladwig-Winters, who was awarded her doctorate for a dissertation on the \\"Aryanization\\" of Berlin department stores, published it on 14 July 2008.https://zzf- potsdam.de/sites/default/files/veranstaltung/files/zzf_presse- information_14_juli_2008.pdfhttps://zzf- potsdam.de/sites/default/files/veranstaltung/files/zzf_presse- information_14_juli_2008.pdf In that report she came to the conclusion that Hedwig Bollhagen was neither a supporter nor patron of National Socialism as the rbb magazine Kontraste had shown. Although she had benefited economically from the general anti-Jewish conditions of the National Socialist establishment phase, she had not exploited them deliberately to her advantage.¬ªHedwig Bollhagen war weder Anh√§ngerin noch F√∂rderin des Nationalsozialismus¬´ (PDF; 35 kB), ZZF, July 2008 Jakobs thereupon gave his consent for a permanent exhibition of Bollhagen's ceramics, which would also be supplemented with the discussion of their time after 1933. In 2002, a newly built grammar school was named after her in the Brandenburg town of Velten. In Hanover, in the district of Seelhorst, a street has borne her name since 2009.

It is a sprawling shrub with thin stems, hairy young shoots, pinnate leaves and pink, four-petalled flowers over a long period. Description Boronia keysii is an open, thin-stemmed, sprawling shrub that typically grows to a height and width of about . The young stems are covered with brownish, star-shaped hairs. It has pinnate leaves with a single, or three, five or seven leaflets long, wide in outline. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs and lack a petiole. The leaflets are elliptic to lance-shaped, the end leaflet long and wide and longer than the side leaflets. The flowers are arranged arranged in groups of between three and six on a peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. The four sepals are egg-shaped to triangular, long with a hairy back. The four petals are deep rose pink to white, long and and hairy on the back. There are eight stamens with the four nearest the sepals slightly long than the four near the petals. Flowering occurs throughout the year but mostly from May to November. The fruit is a capsule long and wide containing four black seeds. Taxonomy and naming Boronia keysii was first formally described in 1926 by Karel Domin from specimens collected by James Keys at Lake Cootharaba in 1909. The description was published in the journal Bibliotheca Botanica published in Stuttgart under the heading Beitrage zur Flora und Pflanzengeographie Australiens (Contributions to the Flora and Plant Geography of Australia). The specific epithet (keysii) honours the collector of the type specimen. Distribution and habitat Key's boronia is usually found in the ecotone between forest and heath and commonly as an understorey species in open forest. It is only known from the Cooloola region near Lake Cootharaba. Conservation Boronia keysii is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. The main threats to the species include changes to the water table, inappropriate fire regimes and invasion by exotic pines from nearby plantations.

Although part of the Anglo-American War of 1812, it took place long after the war ended, as the commander of the United States Sloop of war USS Peacock was unaware that the war had ended six months earlier. The British commander of Nautilus hailed that the war was over but refused to haul down his flag and Peacock opened fire, killing and wounding several of the crew of Nautilus, which then surrendered. Once Nautiluss commander provided proof that the war had ended, the Americans released the brig and its crew. This was the last action of the war. Prelude Towards the end of 1814, the Americans were gathering a squadron in New York, under Commodore Stephen Decatur, which was intended to disrupt British merchant shipping in the Indian Ocean.Roosevelt, p.221 On 14 January 1815, Decatur took advantage of a blizzard and left harbour in the frigate USS President, while the blockading squadron of the Royal Navy had been blown off station. However, the President went aground on the bar at the harbour mouth. When it was eventually floated off, the damaged frigate encountered the returning British squadron and was captured. The remaining vessels of Decatur's squadron (the sloops of war USS Peacock, commanded by Master Commandant Lewis Warrington, and USS Hornet and the brig tender USS Tom Bowline) were not aware of the Presidents fate. On 22 January, a strong north-westerly gale blew up and the three American vessels sortied in thick weather the next day. They reached open sea despite the British blockaders being plainly in sight as the Americans passed the bar.Roosevelt, p.236 The three American vessels made for a pre-arranged rendezvous with the President at Tristan da Cunha. Hornet became separated from the other two vessels during the voyage. Peacock and Tom Bowline reached Tristan da Cunha on 18 March but were driven off by a gale.Roosevelt, p.228 They returned on 23 March to find that in their absence the Hornet had arrived, and had engaged and captured HMS Penguin. Penguin was too badly damaged to be repaired and was later set on fire. Tom Bowline was sent to Rio de Janeiro as a cartel with Penguins crew. After waiting in vain for the President until 15 April, Hornet and Peacock set out together for the Indian Ocean. On 27 April, they encountered the British ship of the line HMS Cornwallis, which they at first mistook for a valuable East Indiaman. When they realised their mistake, the American ships split up to escape. Cornwallis pursued the slower Hornet, which evaded capture only by jettisoning all guns and small arms, most of the stores, and even substantial parts of the sloop's structure.Forester, pp.218-220 Capture of Nautilus Warrington pressed on into the Indian Ocean. During the next few weeks, Peacock captured four valuable prizes. Rather than weaken his crew by putting them aboard the captured vessels and sending them into friendly or neutral ports, Warrington had the prizes set on fire, after removing their cargo and useful stores.Elting, p.325 fn He remained unaware that Congress had ratified the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war between Britain and America, on 18 February. On 30 June, Peacock was in the Sunda Straits, with the island of Krakatau under the sloop's lee.Forester, p.220 There she sighted the East India Company's armed brig . Nautilus measured 200 tons, was armed with ten 18-pounder carronades and four 9-pounder guns, and had a crew of 80, many of whom were lascars. (Peacock was armed with twenty 32-pounder carronades and two 12-pounder guns.) Nautiluss commander, Lieutenant Boyce, sent a boat to Peacock, with his Purser, Mr. Bartlett. Bartlett later insisted that he informed Warrington that the war had ended before Warrington ordered him to be taken below; Warrington denied this. As Peacock closed in on Nautilus, Lieutenant Boyce hailed, and repeated that the war was over, but Warrington later claimed that he had thought this a ruse de guerre to give Nautilus time to escape under the cover of the neutral (Dutch East Indies) fort of Anjer. He demanded that Boyce haul down his flag. Rather than submit in such a manner, Boyce prepared to fight.Roosevelt, pp.240-241 Peacock then fired a single broadside (or by Bartlett's account, two broadsides), which caused substantial damage to the Nautilus. Warrington's attack killed one seaman, two European invalids, and three lascars aboard the brig, mortally wounded Nautiluss first lieutenant, and wounded Boyce and five lascars.. Peacock suffered no damage or casualties.Roosevelt, p.241 Aftermath When Boyce provided documents proving that the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war, had been ratified, Warrington released Nautilus. At no point did he in any way inquire about Boyce's condition or that of any of the injured on Nautilus. Peacock returned to New York on 30 October. A court of inquiry in Boston a year later of course exonerated Warrington of all blame. In his report on the incident, Warrington stated that the only British casualties had been lascars.

Biography =Early life= Destined for a military career by his father, the young Rodrigo was sent in 1612 to Ceuta, where he remained in military service for two years.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.49 He returned to Portugal and married D. Maria de Faro, daughter of the Count of Vimioso and niece of D. Francisco de Faro, the niece of Philip II of Spain (Philip I of Portugal). He was 25 years old when his father died, the point at which he succeeded the man as the Captain-Donat√°rio of the island of S√£o Miguel. =Donat√°rio= He frequented the Spanish Corte in Madrid, accompanied the royal family in diverse trips throughout Spain, and lived a comfortable life. Among other servants he had a personal secretary, valets, butlers, pages, squires and footmen, all working for him in his duties. By royal decree, in 1624, he was obliged to take his retinue to Ponta Delgada and carry out his role as dontary captain, but following the death of this wife returned to Corte in 1626. He remarried on 1 June 1628, to D. Maria Coutinho, daughter of the Count of Vidigueira, the Queen's handmaiden and descendant of Vasco da Gama: at the wedding the couple were assisted by the Kings of Spain and the entire court. The King, therefore, continued to bestow on him and his descendants the title of Count of Vila Franca, an act that formalized these privileges in perpetuity, once the original titles to his father and grandfather were only until the end of their lives. Remaining in Lisbon in the ancestral home in the estate of S√£o Francisco, in 1629 he and his wife had a daughter, followed in 1630 by a son, which they named Manuel Lu√≠s.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.51 Following his birth, Rodrigo moved once again to Ponta Delgada, leaving behind his family while he settled into the new accommodations. He coordinated the assistance and reconstruction following the great volcanic eruption in Furnas in September 1630, which caused the death of 195 people. A Plinian eruption, the explosion caused the liberation of gas, pumice and ash that reached as far as Corvo. At that time rumours began to appear that the Count was bisexual, this after being caught in flagranti delicto with a nun in the cell of the local convent. Yet, the rumours persisted and stories spread of his homosexual dalliances with his pages and footmen. Denounced by the Cortes in Madrid, he departed for this city, where at great cost he was exonerated. Still, owing to the scandal he remained there for some time, until he was ordered to return to S√£o Miguel in 1639, by regal authority. Yet, on his arrival the scandalous commentaries continued, with rumours of sodomy and dalliances with nuns. The Count was in S√£o Miguel at the time of the beginning of the Portuguese Restoration War, receiving the notice of the acclamation of John IV of Portugal in the middle of January 1641 from Francisco de Ornelas. In a dubious position, he only accepted the new King when John was secure in his position, and even so, only after the Fortress of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista had fallen. Then, following a royal letter on 6 April 1641, that was personally written to him, he accepted and ordered the acclamation of the new King. Assured that he would be received at Corte, he parted for Lisbon in August 1642. On his arrival he lived at Corte, and was given the task of provisioner for the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia of Lisbon in 1644. In 1646 he commanded a company of men in the Alentejo, during the Restoration War. =Later life= During this time rumours of his homosexuality continued, creating scandals that only his privileges allowed him to negate. In 1648 he returned to Ponta Delgada where he established his home in a privileged place. In his entourage were various pages, between 13 and 24, who slept in an adjacent bedroom, allegedly monitoring his sleep. Following illness from a hemiplegia, he returned to Lisbon in 1650. In the next year, on 4 May 1651, the inevitable occurred: Lucas Leite Pereira, a former page, presented a new complaint to the Inquisition, that due to the public scandal, they were obliged to initiate a judicial process against the Count.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.52 Receiving a complaint of sodomy on 5 May 1651, two days later the General-Council of the Holy Office of the Portuguese Inquisition deliberated on the material, owing to the Counts position of power. Owing to the grave accusations, the Council ordered that arrest of the accused, not without informing the King. The King, informed of this material by the General Inquisition, and knowing of the rumours, charged the Count of Cantanhede, cousin of the accused, to advise him and counselled him to abandon the kingdom. The Count ordered the preparation of a ship, but, unafraid of the gravity of the situation did not embark, owing to his illness, but sent a petition to the Holy Office and revealing his location. This would not have been an issue, if it were the first accusation made against the Count, but a record of scandal had followed the nobleman since 1620, and his petition of dismissal was rejected. Since his petition was refused, the Count's departure was rushed for the evening of the 26 May, to France. Yet, owing to tardiness in his preparation, he was arrested at his home on 25 May and sent the Holy Office. The King tried to intervene, requesting his transfer to the royal towers, but the Inquisition refused, citing that he had violated his pages and laws. The accusation on 5 May included five other complaints, that remained secret in the archives of the Holy Office. A trial was meticulously organized, and the testimonies of the complainants confirmed the Count's homosexual practices. Among those debriefed were several pages, that admitted to a sexual relationship with the Count, describing in detail their practices, and his own son, who admitted an incestuous relationship. The count confessed, confirming all the cases, adding several other new cases; the records, a copy of which was saved in the Azorean Regional Archive, noted that the count had maintained sexual relationships with nuns in various convents of Ponta Delgada, Vila Franca do Campo and Ribeira Grande, in addition to a number of youths, including his son and daughter. The process was explicit for the epoch, and included excerpts of the practices of homosexuals and bisexuals in the 17th century. Owing to the proof and his own confession, the count was condemned for sodomy on 20 December 1652, and sentenced to life, resulting in the forfeiture of his possessions, including the Captaincy of the island of S√£o Miguel. His wife and his influential family attempted to commute the sentence to life in a convent, rather than the dungeons of the inquisition. In the end Rodrigo was sent to the Convent of Cabo de S√£o Vicente in 1658, where he remained until, in bad health he died on 30 April 1662.

The hymnal, which appeared under this title from 1647 to 1737 in 45 editions, has been described as \\"the most successful and widely-known Lutheran hymnal of the 17th century\\". Cr√ºger composed melodies to texts that were published in the hymnal and are still sung today, including \\"Jesu, meine Freude\\", \\"Herzliebster Jesu\\" and \\"Nun danket alle Gott\\". Between 1647 and 1661, Cr√ºger first printed 90 songs by his friend Paul Gerhardt, including \\"O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden\\".  Purpose  The volume of hymns was intended for use in both church and private services. The explanation of the Latin title was given from the very first publication in 1647: \\"Das ist: Vbung der Gottseligkeit in Christlichen und Trostreichen Ges√§ngen\\" (That is: practice of Godliness in Christian and comforting chants). The subtitle continued: \\"Herrn D. Martini Lutheri f√ºrnemlich / und denn auch anderer vornehmer und gelehrter Leute. Ordentlich zusammen gebracht\\" (mostly by Martin Luther / and others of his faithful followers and confessors of pure Protestant doctrine. Collected meticulously). Subsequent text on the title page varied between editions, and could include the number of hymns in the volume‚Äîthe fifth edition stated it had 500 hymns, while the penultimate 44th edition contained 1316.  History  Cr√ºger was appointed Kantor at the Nikolaikirche in Berlin in 1622, a post he held until his death in 1662. In 1640, he published a collection of 240 hymn texts and melodies as Newes vollk√∂mliches Gesangbuch (New perfect song book), which contained core songs of the Reformation, especially by Martin Luther, and 18 new melodies composed by Cr√ºger, mostly to texts by Johann Heermann. In 1643 Cr√ºger met Paul Gerhardt, who had taken up a position as a tutor in Berlin. Cr√ºger wrote melodies and choral settings for many of Gerhardt's songs. In 1647, Cr√ºger published a second volume of hymns, titled Praxis pietatis melica. Its 383 texts and 170 melodies included those published in 1640; among the new material was the first publication of 18 texts by Gerhardt. The volume's title was derived from the title of a book by Lewis Bayley, The Practice of Piety, which had been translated to German in 1631. By the fifth edition in 1653, the number of hymns had increased to 500, and 82 of these were on Gerhardt's texts. It also contained \\"Schm√ºcke dich, o liebe Seele\\", a communion hymn on lyrics by Johann Franck with a melody by Cr√ºger. The tenth edition in 1661, the last one compiled by Cr√ºger, had 550 hymns in all, and a total of 90 by Gerhardt. The hymnal continued being published through 1737, when its 45th and final edition was printed; for much of its existence, it had the widest distribution in German-speaking lands of any Protestant hymnal. Several of its songs are still in use, including \\"Jesu, meine Freude\\" (text by Johann Franck), \\"Nun danket alle Gott\\" (by Martin Rinkart), and \\"Herzliebster Jesu\\" (by Johann Heermann). The term praxis pietatis led to naming the later movement pietism.  Hymns by Gerhardt  1647 The edition contained 18 hymns by Paul Gerhardt, including: * \\"\\" * \\"\\" * \\"\\" * \\"\\" * \\"\\" 1653 A hymnal was commissioned by Luise Henriette of Brandenburg.

In 1326, while serving Serbian King Stefan Deƒçanski (ruled 1321‚Äì31), Branoje Branivojeviƒá, the lord of Ston and Pelje≈°ac, was given a great two-handed sword. Probably at their highest point they ruled from Cetina river to the town of Kotor. Internal fights provided opportunity for the peripheral nobility, which would have bad consequences in the west, Hum; the Branivojeviƒá brothers entered politics in the relations with Venice, Croatian magnates and Bosnian ban. Though nominal vassals of Serbia, the Branivojeviƒá family attacked Serbian interests and other local nobles of Hum, who in 1326 turned against Serbia and the Branivojeviƒái. The Hum nobility approached Stjepan Kotromaniƒá II, the ban of Bosnia, who then annexed most of Hum. The Dra≈æivojeviƒái of Nevesinje, as vassals of the Bosnian Ban, became the leading family of Hum in 1330s.

Early life Kiely was born on 2 June 1953 in Warrenpoint, County Down, Northern Ireland. His grandfather's brother was the Olympian John Jesus Flanagan, inventor of the hammer for Slazenger America as used in the Olympic Games, and three-times record-breaking gold medallist.John Flanagan: Obituary in New York Times, June 5, 1938 Kiely's childhood was spent in many parts of Ireland, due to his father's work as manager with the Munster & Leinster Bank. Aged 7, he was sent to Wimbledon, London to his aunt. In 1963 on the death of his father, John Francis Kiely, he was sent by his guardian and uncle, Edward Vaughan-Neil, to Mt St. Joseph's Abbey, Roscrea where he was a boarder from 1966 to 1969. He completed his education in Blackrock College, Dublin, from 1969 to 1971. Wandering, work, academic life He became a field study technician for Smedley HP in Cambridgeshire 1973‚Äì1975 and wandered in Europe working part- time at various jobs while reading in the national libraries of many countries, but otherwise mainly residing in Paris and London. Kiely attended University College Galway in 1976, participating on the Art Council-funded National Writers Workshop, taught Literature in Colegio Xaloc, Barcelona and was made an honorary fellow of Iowa University in 1983. He holds a Masters in Literature from Trinity College in 2005 and a PhD from University College Dublin in 2009. His doctoral thesis on John L. Sweeney: Patron of Poetry at Harvard's Woodberry Poetry Room gained him an American Fulbright Award in 2007, enabling years of full-time lecturing at American universities including Boise State University and University of Idaho-Moscow, and research at Harvard. Writings Kiely co-edited The Belle, a counter-cultural magazine, with Maurice Scully from 1978 to 1979. He moved from Dublin to Spain where he taught at Colegio Xaloc and gave public lectures on poetry and literature. Quintesse, published in 1982 in Dublin by Co-Op Books, found a New York publisher in 1985. During this period he was invited to the University of Iowa on the International Writing Programme Fellowship working with the American poet Paul Engel as well as poets Gary Snyder, Marvin Bell and Jorie Graham. Mere Mortals, an experimental pastiche of the post-Joycean novel, was published in 1989 in Dublin. With the publication of the biography of Francis Stuart, a Nazi sympathizer and collaborator, Kiely wandered into controversy. The book titled Francis Stuart: Artist and Outcast came out in Ireland and America, and Kiely's stance was seen by some as \\"diplomatic\\"Murphy, John L. \\"Francis Stuart\\", √âtudes irlandaises, 35-1, 2010 or even as an attempt to partly whitewash Stuart, whereas some others suggested that Kiely was \\"not writing the book that more opinionated readers, eager to prove Stuart's lapses, would have demanded.\\"Murphy, Richard T. New Hibernia Review Volume 12, Number 3, F√≥mhar/Autumn 2008 pp. 158-160. Kiely's poetry such as the collection Breakfast with Sylvia, published in 2005 received the Kavanagh Fellowship in 2006, was highly praised in America and Ireland by leading poets. ‚ÄòKiely has a reputation as strong in Europe and the US as it is here'.McAuley, James J. ‚ÄúWit, Laments and Bodhr√°n Satire,‚Äù Irish Times, 16 July 2005. Besides book publication and work in anthologies his poetry has appeared in The Edinburgh Review, Poetry Ireland Review, Adrift (New York), Foolscap (London), Oasis (London), Acumen (UK), Other Poetry (UK), Cyphers, The Literary Review (New Jersey), Chapman (Scotland), Southword, Cork Literary Review, The Black Mountain Review, The Shop, Fortnight, Storm (Scotland), Touchstone (UK), Stony Thursday Book, Idaho Arts Quarterly, The Journal: Cumbria (UK), Decanto (UK), The Poetry Bus, The Sunday Independent, and Revival Literary Journal. Kiely's plays, Multiple Indiscretions (1997) and Children of No Importance (2000), have been produced by RT√â as well as \\"In This Supreme Hour\\" at the Derry Playhouse in 2016. He is also a successful novelist for young readers. A Horse Called El Dorado won the CBI Bisto Award in 2006. SOS Lusitania (2013) is a novel about war, politics and conspiracy theory was the One Book One Community Choice in the Centenary Year of the Lusitania for 2015 during The Remember the Lusitania Project. His most recent adult fiction is The Welkinn Complex, which exposes psychiatric practice and the pharmaceutical industry, while UCD Belfield Metaphysical: a retrospective is a collection of poems published in 2017. Kiely received Arts Council Literature Bursary Awards for his writings in 1980, 1989, 1990, 1998, 1999, 2004, A Bisto Award in 2005 and The Patrick Kavanagh Fellowship in Poetry 2006. Criticism Kiely had begun reviewing poetry and literature, first with John Mulcahy's Hibernia, and later for various publications including The Examiner and Books Ireland. He became New Writing Editor and later Literary Editor (2000‚Äì2005) on Books Ireland at the invitation of its founder, Jeremy Cecil Addis, in 1995. He writes extensive and controversial criticism in Hibernia, Irish Examiner, The Democrat Arts Page, Irish Studies Review, Honest Ulsterman, Fortnight, Books Ireland, The London Magazine, The Irish Book Review, Poetry Ireland Review, Irish Times, Irish Arts Review, Irish Literary Review, and Idaho Arts Quarterly. Kiely's poetry criticism is not just confined to homegrown Irish publishing which he has extensively commented on in many reviews and surveys. He questioned the pervasively state-funded poetry scene amidst the arts in general \\"amidst cliques and cabals\\", and made public the lack of accountability of many arts institutions. He launched vociferous and persistent criticism of institutions such as Aosd√°na, which he feels are anathema to the identity and autonomy of the serious artist. His statements about the Arts Council's Aosd√°na reflect the wider concern along with other artists such as Robert Ballagh in relation to public funding channels devoid of accountability. His another statement reached national news when he reviewed President Michael D. Higgins' Selected Poems in 2012 calling his poems \\"crime against literature\\". Irish poet Paul Durcan, quoted by The Irish Central, defended Michael D. Higgins, who, in his view, \\"has an absolute commitment to the spirit of poetry.\\" Kiely's recent works in criticism, Harvard's Patron Jack of all Poets, about the Woodberry Poetry Room, and critical exegesis Seamus Heaney and the Great Poetry Hoax, prompted the American poet Carlo Parcelli to comment 'Kiely has unmasked a fraud that as he predicted years ago has burgeoned into an institutional conspiracy to honour the mediocre and the sham.' The re-issue of the revised edition of the Stuart biography in 2017 alongside Geoffrey Elliott's biography of John Lodwick brought to public attention the Stuart-Lodwick association of writers who took different sides in WWII and thereafter formed an ideological friendship The publication of Arts Council Immortals albeit the unofficial biography of the Arts Council 1951-2020 was praised by independent underground arts practitioners, writers and poets but has also involved legal action behind the scenes and unease among establishment commentators including John Burns who found it 'makes Finnegans Wake look like a Ladybird book' Published works * Pieta, The Anthology (short fiction) ed.

Written over a period of 20 years, the essays deal with themes of identity, home and belonging. Reviewed in The Independent, the book was called \\"a polymorphous delight that always retains at its core the notion of identity: how it is constructed, how it is thrust upon us, how we can change it. It is about our sense of self, how we fit within society ‚Äì and how both society and individuals must adapt to each other in order for both to thrive.\\"Robert Epstein, \\"Colour Me English, By Caryl Phillips\\" (review), The Independent, 14 August 2011. In the words of Courttia Newland in Wasafiri magazine, the collection \\"revisits the author‚Äôs chosen territories of ‚Äòdisplacement, home/homelessness, race and identity‚Äô, as defined by Ren√©e Schatteman, editor of Conversations with Caryl Phillips (2009). It is a volume heaving with insights, musings and ideology, some thirty-eight essays in all, each dissecting the notion of tribal belonging and its polar opposite, exclusion. Much of the collection details the travels Phillips has undertaken since he was first published by Faber and Faber in 1985, spanning countries as diverse as Sierra Leone, Ghana, Belgium and France. The writings also map temporal journeys; essays such as 'Water' go back to 1993, while others like 'Ground Zero' and another on the Chinese-American novelist, Ha Jin, are clearly written more recently.\\"Courttia Newland reviews Colour Me English by Caryl Phillips , Wasafiri. According to Samira Shackle in the New Statesman, \\"This book is as much about writing as it is about race. Phillips explores his own development as a writer and the struggle of negotiating identities. Seen through this prism, travel is both part of a 'long tradition' of British writers and an attempt to work out where his identity should be placed. He feels he cannot do this in England, a country that 'seemed to revel in its ability to reduce identity to clich√©s'. Phillips had it tough growing up in Leeds in the 1960s and 1970s and undeniably life was hard for the first wave of immigrants to the UK, yet I can't help but feel that he is sometimes too harsh on Britain. Too often, he writes as if little has changed - perhaps because he has lived abroad for many years. (...) Nonetheless, this is a thought-provoking collection by an accomplished author whose subtle, unobtrusive style allows him to explore familiar subjects in an original way.\\"Samira Shackle, \\"Colour Me English\\" (review), New Statesman, 15 August 2011.

In the aftermath of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, coin was short in British Columbia.

The predominantly residential district stretches along Dorchester Road, on either side of its junction with Baker Hill Road. The village's rise in development started in the early 19th century as it was at a crossroads of the east-west Dorchester Road, and the north-south Baker Hill Road and Acorn Hill Road. The village grew rapidly in the 1820s, with a number of simple Greek Revival houses, and in 1830 the Baptist Church was built. The other major civic building in the village is the Lyme Academy, built in 1839, albeit with more Federal than Greek Revival styling. Grant Brook, which runs parallel to Dorchester Road, provided a source of power for the growth of small industrial efforts, including a sawmill (of which only foundations remain) at the corner of Dorchester and Baker Hill Roads. This industry provided a second minor building boom in the late 19th to early 20th century. Most of the houses in the district are vernacular Greek Revival or Cape in their styling; probably the most elaborate Greek Revival house is the 1857 Beal-Pike House at 41 Dorchester Road. Lyme Center was one of two village centers established in the town's early years, with Lyme Common taking a leading role as the site of its civic and religious buildings. Lyme Center was in the early years known as Cook Village, after James Cook, who first settled the area in 1783, and whose family dominated its population into the 1820s. Cook owned and operated the early saw and grist mills in the area, and controlled development of the area until his death in 1814. Cook's son established the village's first tavern, serving travelers on passing stagecoaches. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

Established in 1781, it includes sixty historic buildings surrounding the town common and along surrounding roads, and is a well- preserved example of a 19th-century village center. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The centerpiece of the district is the oblong town common, a flat, grassy expanse extending east-west just south of a bend in Main Street (New Hampshire Route 10), whose visual anchor, the First Congregational Church, stands at the eastern end. The district extends along NH 10 north as far as High Street, and south a short distance beyond the common area. The common area only began to take shape in 1781, after a meeting house (now the Nichols Store) was built in 1781. The presence of the meeting house meant that the village (then known as \\"Lyme Plain\\") would be of greater civic importance than Lyme Center, located to the east, nearer the town's geographic center. Layout of the common was followed by the construction of a significant number of Federal and Greek Revival houses between 1790 and about 1820. The First Congregational Church was built c. 1810, at which time the horse sheds behind it were also built; these are believed to be the longest such surviving row in the state. The other major building boom in the area was in 1840-65, the years preceding the Civil War. There are some 20th century Colonial Revival structures, and later new construction (and replacement of old) has generally been sympathetic to the extant styles.

In December 2016, the High Court in Ireland asked for the company to be wound up following a period of liquidation.http://m.independent.ie/business/media/insolvent-irish-tv-firm-is- wound-up-35309790.html On 21 December 2016, Irish TV confirmed the station's closure. On 2 February 2017, The Irish Post acquired Irish TV,http://irishpost.co.uk/irish-post-acquires-digital-and-intellectual- property-assets-of-diaspora-broadcaster-irish-tv/ saving the channel from closure. On 8 March 2017, without warning, Irish TV went off the air. Its Sky slot was bought by Viacom International Media Networks Europe to launch Spike +1. Programming County Matters was the flagship news programme on Irish TV which had developed into a nationwide 32-county wide series composed of weekly half-hour programmes from each county (Dublin County Matters; Mayo County Matters; Cork County Matters etc.). The series fulfilled the Irish TV motto of Local Stories, Global Audience and promises to document ordinary people doing extraordinary things through broadcasting the news and views from each region. The series covered 16 hours of broadcasting on the channel each week. Irish TV also broadcast a wide range of music, entertainment, sports, special interest and live documentaries and in 2015 founded the first ever Irish County Music Awards on television. To coincide with its launch on Saorview in Autumn 2016 the channel launched a live weekend chat show to be hosted by popular presenter and musician Malachi Cush. The channel also entered into a media partnership with the global Tata Communications network to deliver Irish TV across the USA while delivery links were also being established to cover the UK, Canada and Australia.

The slabs were mainly inscribed in Burmese, Pyu, Mon and Pali, and a few lines in Sanskrit. According to an early analysis, the stele was founded in 1079 by King Saw Lu of Pagan (Bagan). Discovery Three broken slabs of the inscription were discovered in Myittha Township, Mandalay Region on 17 November 2013 and a fourth piece was found on 27 November 2013. A fifth piece is still missing. The found four pieces were rejoined and currently stands in Petaw monastery. The slab size is in height, and in breadth.Bee Htaw Monzel 2014: 2 Initial analyses The initial readings of the slabs threatened to upend the current understanding of Pagan-era dates. The initial reports claimed that the inscription was founded by King Saw Lu, and contained the year 415 ME (1053/54 CE), presumably as its inscription date. Moreover, the initial reports conjectured that the fifth script might be Tai-Yuan, Gon (Khun or Kengtung) Shan, over two centuries earlier than the earliest known evidence of a Tai-Shan script. However, at least one subsequent analysis does not agree with some of the initial readings. According to Bee Htaw Monzel, the slabs were indeed founded by Saw Lu and mainly inscribed in Burmese, Pyu, Mon and Pali, and a few lines of Sanskrit.Bee Htaw Monzel 2014: 20 His analysis finds that the Mon and Pyu versions state 441 as the year of inscription, and that the Pyu version also gives the 10th month and the 3rd day.Bee Htaw Monzel 2014: 18 Bee Htaw Monzel's translation of the extant inscriptions can be summarized as:Bee Htaw Monzel 2014: 20‚Äì21 * King Saw Lu reconstructed the recently ravaged pagoda in Myittha, which was originally built by his grandfather; * The king dedicated the reconstructed pagoda on Wednesday, full moon of Pyatho 441 ME (unexplained translation of year 441, 10th month, 3rd day);It is unclear how Bee Htaw Monzel (Bee Htaw Monzel 2014: 21) came up with Wednesday, full moon of Pyatho 441 ME from his own reading of year 441, 10th month, 3rd day. His analysis does not explain where he got the full moon day or how the 3rd day could be translated as Wednesday. At any rate, the full moon of Pyatho 441 ME would have been Monday, 9 December 1079. If the 3rd day were read as the 3rd day of the month, the date would be the 3rd waxing of Pyatho 441 ME (Wednesday, 27 November 1079). * The king donated a statue of the Buddha in the size of the king's own body along with 10 persons, oxen and paddy fields to care for the pagoda Significance Whether the inscription was inscribed in 1079 CE (or 1052 as initially reported), the inscription, if the readings are confirmed, appears to be the earliest evidence of the Burma Mon script. (The currently accepted date of the earliest Burma Mon is 1093 CE.) Furthermore, the initial reading of 415 ME (25 March 1053 to 25 March 1054 CE) as the date of the inscription's foundation would have upended the current understanding of the early Pagan period. * If 1053/54 proves to be the inscription date, it would be: :#One of the earliest extant inscriptions of the Burmese script. Its inscription date would be 60 years earlier than the Myazedi inscription ( 1112/1113), one of the oldest known stone inscriptions in Burma (Myanmar). (The earliest known inscription of Burmese‚Äîthe copper-gilt umbrella inscription of the Mahabodhi Temple in India‚Äîis dated to 1035 CE. According to a recast stone inscription from the late 18th century, the Burmese script was already in use by 984 CE.Aung-Thwin 2005: 167‚Äì178, 197‚Äì200) :#The earliest instance of the Burma Mon script. The earliest evidence of the predecessor script to the modern Mon script is dated to 1093 CE. (The Mon script of Dvaravati or Haripunjaya (both in present-day Thailand) is presumably earlier than the 11th century but so far there is no evidence to prove any linkage between the two Mon scripts.) * If 1053/54 proves to be the inscription date, and if it was inscribed during Saw Lu's reign as king, it would mean that: :# King Saw Lu was already reigning in 1053/1054 as opposed to the currently accepted reign date of 1077/78‚Äì1084. :# The Myazedi inscription and most of the Burmese chronicles are incorrect about the chronology of early Pagan kings. Only the Maha Yazawin chronicle, which says Saw Lu reigned between 1035 and 1061, would be correct with respect to Saw Lu's reign. Currently, mainstream scholarship accepts Zatadawbon Yazawin's dates, which agree with Myazedi's dates, as the most authoritative chronicle for the early Pagan period chronology.(Maha Yazawin 2006: 346‚Äì349): Among the four major chronicles, only Zatadawbon Yazawin's dates line up with Anawrahta's inscriptionally verified accession date of 1044 CE. (Aung-Thwin 2005: 121‚Äì123): In general, Zata is considered \\"the most accurate of all Burmese chronicles, particularly with regard to the best-known Pagan and Ava kings, many of whose dates have been corroborated by epigraphy.\\" * If the fifth script, currently speculated as the Tai-Yuan, Gon (Khun or Kengtung) Shan or an early NƒÅgarƒ´ script, is confirmed to be an early form of Tai-Shan script, :#it would be the oldest, Tai/Shan script, predating the Thai script, believed to be derived from Khmer in 1293, by over 240 years. Moreover, it would mean the Tai-Yuan or the Gon/Khun script existed 240 years prior to the founding of the Lan Na kingdom in 1292. Most of the Shan scripts came into existence in the late 16th century only. :#the Tai/Shan speakers were sufficiently prominent in the early Pagan period that their script was used in a royal inscription. This contradicts the current understanding that Shan speakers moved in en masse to Kachin and Shan hills only in the mid-to-late 13th century.Lieberman 2003: 114‚Äì115 :#Burmese and northern Thai chronicles' claim that Anawrahta's realm encompassed Kengtung and Chiang Mai regions could be reconsidered. (Both Chiang Mai and Chaing Saen chronicles say their rulers paid tribute to Anawrahta, the father of Saw Lu.Oriental 1900: 375‚Äì376 But the claims of the chronicles, which were written centuries after Anawrahta's time, are not accepted by mainstream scholarship.) Current status As of April 2014, about 60 percent of the tablets had been deciphered. They have deciphered all of the Mon and Pali text and about 10 percent of Pyu. A copy of text in the Nagari writing system used in northern India and Nepal has been sent to the Archaeological Survey of India for deciphering. The Indian department replies that the inscription is not preserved in better condition. Some letters are peeled off and some are worn out. Only few letters in lines 6 and 7 are well preserved. The Indian department reveals that the inscription is engraved in early Nagari characters, retaining some of the features of Siddhamatrika or Kutila scripts. What has been translated so far describes the donation of a monastery, Maha Anuruda Deva Rama, by King Saw Lu and his wife Manicanda.

This modest wood frame building was built in 1774 to serve as one of two courthouses for Grafton County, which had just been established; it is one of the oldest surviving civic structures in the state. It is now the museum of the Plymouth Historical Society. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and included in the Plymouth Historic District in 1986. Description and history The Old Grafton County Courthouse stands in the town center of Plymouth, on the south side of Court Street just west of the town hall. It is a square wood frame structure, on each side, with a truncated hip roof topped by a cupola. The open cupola has square posts at the corners, and is covered by a low-pitch hip roof. The main facade of the building faces north, and is three bays wide, with sash windows flanking the main entrance. The entrance is sheltered by a gabled hood supported by simple triangular bracketing. A small ell projects from the rear of the building. The interior of the building consists of a single large chamber, whose styling is reflective of 1876 alterations. The courthouse was built in 1774, shortly after Grafton County was established, and Plymouth was named one of its shire towns. It was described at the time of its construction as having \\"a stately cupola out of proportion to the diminutive size of the structure\\". After a new courthouse was built in 1823, the building was sold and moved to the outskirts of Plymouth, and used as a wheelwright's shop, undergoing significant alteration to accommodate that function. In 1876 the building was acquired by Henry W. Blair, who sought to preserve the historic building. He had it moved it to its present location and adapted for use as a library, which was managed by the local Young Ladies' Library Association. The cupola, lost during its use as a shop, was added back sometime before 1906. The building is now home to the Plymouth Historical Society.

Introduction Scientists have identified P. skrjabini, along with several other species including P. westermani and P. miyazakii, to be key pathogens in causing paragonimiasis in humans, primarily in Asian regions of the world. P. skrjabini is especially prevalent in 26 provinces in China with cases appearing more recently in India and Vietnam as well. From a morphological and genetic standpoint, P. skrjabini is most closely related to the species P. miyazakii, so much so that two sub-species have been classified separately within the P. skrjabini complex: P. skrjabini skrjabini and P. skrjabini miyazakii. Doanh PN (2007) establishes the importance of learning more about P. skrjabini, asserting that \\"among Paragonimus species, P. westermani followed by P. skrjabini complex are the major pathogens for human paragonimiasis in Asia.\\" History Max Braun in 1899 first defined the genus Paragonimus, which initially only included the species P. westermani. In Vietnam, since paragonimiasis was first reported there in 1906, it was presumed for 89 years that only one species of Paragonimus lung fluke, P. westermani, caused paragonmiasis in humans. However, scientists have been conducting many studies of crabs and humans infected with paragonimiasis, leading to the discovery of several previously unknown species. The few cases reported in North America of paragonimiasis are most likely the result of diseased individuals traveling to the area from a different country or people consuming infected, imported food. \\"P. skrjabini\\" is endemic in China and was first described in the Guangdong Province in 1959, originating from a viverrid's lungs. Today, according to the World Health Organization, estimates put the number of persons afflicted with paragonimiasis at 20.7 million and the number at risk of contracting the disease at 293 million. For P. skrjabini, it stands as a public health threat in certain areas of the world, such as the Three Gorges Reservoir where it is the primary paragonimiasis causing parasite. Changes in the environment such as pollution and the persistence of individuals' consumption habits of raw crab puts paragonimiasis epidemics at high risk. \\"Skrjabini\\" is named in honor of the Russian Helminthologist, Konstantin Skrjabin (1878-1972). Life Cycle The life cycle of P. skrjabini involves three hosts. The first intermediate host is a mollusk (typically a snail), the second intermediate host is a crustacean (typically a crab), and the definitive host is a mammal such as a dog, cat, or a human. Among others, freshwater crab species of the genus Nanhaipotamon are known to be second intermediate hosts for P. skrjabini. The mammal is the definitive host because it is the site where sexual reproduction occurs and adult P. skrjabini flukes develop. Infection begins when humans consume raw or uncooked crustaceans such as crabs that contain metacercariae of P. skrjabini. P. skrjabini metacercarie are typically located in the muscles of the crabs's bodies (Zhang et al. 2012). Next, in the animal or human's small intestine, the metacercarie excyst (emerge from a cyst) and travel to the abdomen before ultimately moving into the lungs. There, adult worms begin to grow and develop. P. skrjabini in humans, however, are known to often fail to make it to the lungs and thus don't reach the stage of adult development. Rather, immature P. skrjabini parasites stay undeveloped and enter the human host's brain, muscles, and various other subcutaneous tissues, leading to extrapulmonary neurologic and abdominal paragonimiasis. P. skrjabini trematodes in the mammal produce and fertilize eggs that then exit the host, typically through feces. In water, the eggs hatch and release miracidium that in turn infect a snail. A sporocyst that contains germinal cells forms in the snail's body cavity, and, following asexual reproduction, produces rediae. Rediae produce cercariae (the larval form of the parasite). The cercariae migrate from the snail to a crab, entering either through direct penetration or by the consumption of the snail by the crab. Often, multiple species of Paragonimus can be found coexisting in one crustacean, suggesting that metacercariae of different species do not compete with each other within the host. The life cycle of P. skrjabini starts over again as mammals or humans eat the crab. Morphology The encysted metacercaria of P. skrjabini tend to have a round and circular shape with a cyst wall that consists of a fragile outer later and thicker middle and inner layers. Excysted metacercariae of P. skrjabini have an oral sucker and a ventral sucker measuring 80-120 ¬µm and 120-60 ¬µm in diameter, respectively. The morphological characteristics of adult worms of P. skrjabini are an elongated body with scattered, singularly arranged cuticular spines, branched testes and ovaries, and a ventral sucker that is larger than the oral sucker. Due to the presence of both ovaries and testes in P. skrjabini parasites, they are hermaphroditic. An esophagus and truncated pharnyx make up the adult digestive system. Symptoms and Diagnosis In humans, P. skrjabini infections can result in a wide variety of symptoms, rendering it difficult to diagnose and challenging to quickly enact proper treatment. Diagnosis typically requires first a general recognition of the symptoms followed by laboratory and radiologic tests. Radiology, for example, can pick up on P. skrjabini's migration to ectopic places like the brain. Serological or immunological tests including intradermal test, immunodiffusion, indirect haemagglutination test, enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot also play a key role in not only diagnosing the overall presence of Paragonimus parasites in the body but also distinguishing the various different species invading. The ELISA test detects the antibody used to combat the P. skrjabini infection. Although cases of P. skrjabini infection can exhibit early symptoms such as abdominal pain, a lack of appetite, and high fever, it can also come on slowly and fail to exhibit identifiable symptoms for a period of latency between 20 days to as long as 3 months. Later on in the infection, the type of symptoms that appear primarily depends on which organs the P. skrjabini parasites enter. Infections and the resulting set of symptoms can be classified under five different types including the subcutaneous mass type, cerebral type, pericarditis type, abdominal type, and pleurisy type. Infections of the pleurisy type, for instance, exhibit symptoms like chest pain and cough while the cerebral type tends to result in vomiting and headaches. The pericarditis type is associated with shortness of breath and palpitation while the abdominal type infections lead to diarrhea and abdominal pain. P. skrjabini has shown no effect on mammalian reproductive abilities. Despite occasional cases resulting in death, P. skrjabini has not been widely known to cause morbidity and death. Surgery may be occasionally necessary for patients with cerebral or pleural paragonimiasis. Children and young adults tend to show a higher rate of infection than adults. Genetic Sequencing and Studies The ITS2 (nuclear ribosomal second internal transcribed spacer region) and CO1 (partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene) sequences of P. skrjabini have been registered in GenBank, which is used to determine similarities and phylogenetic relationships between various species of Paragonimus in different parts of the world. ITS2 sequences are utilized when studying inter-species variation, and CO1 sequences are important when studying intra-species variation. For instance, Doanh et al. (2012) determined that, after analyzing the CO1 sequences of groups of P. skrjabini in India, China, and Vietnam, a fair amount of genetic differences exist between the groups. Doanh et al. (2012) also used ITS2 and CO1 sequences to prove that populations of P. skrjabini in both Vietnam and China are the same genetically. Blair et al. (2005) studied CO1 sequences and found molecular similarities and differences in the P. skrjabini complex, concluding that there should be two sub-species of P. skrjabini. Methods to study P. skrjabini consist of collecting samples of crabs to analyze how metacercarie is distributed in the body, purposefully infecting dogs in order to extract worms from it to later examine under a microscope, and various other tests and assays. Prevention and Treatment First and foremost, health education is necessary in order to teach people the ways in which to evade infections of P. skrjabini. Through a survey of people in the Three Gorges Reservoir in China where P. skrjabini cases have appeared, Zhang et al. (2012) reported that out of a sampling of 724 people, the consumption rate of raw crab was 68.09%. And out of the 213 individuals that tested positive for P. skrjabini infection, every single one of them had consumed raw crab. Reasons behind this eating habit can be explained by the various culinary preferences and unique customs in the local area where Paragonimus species are endemic. But, people must be educated in ways that encourage fully cooking meals that contain crab and routinely washing their hands after handling any crustacean. In Korea, for instance, education proved to be successful in reducing the prevalence of paragonimiasis cases after people learned about proper eating habits, ways to reduce pollution, and the importance of not using crayfish juice in medicine. The same method can be applied in areas where P. skrjabini remains a health concern, for all it takes is cooking the crabs to kill the P. skrjabini parasite. Praziquantel can be used to treat individuals infected with P. skrjabini parasites. Prazinquatal acts quickly to cure paragonimiasis, showing results after even one day, unlike the previously used drug bithionol, which required extended treatment and involved more severe side effects. The latest drug being investigated to treat paragonimiasis is triclabendazole.

He was charged with defrauding the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) of US$1.2 billion and was the world's biggest single fraudster at the time. His company, the Gulf Group, was the BCCI's single largest borrower.  Early life  Abbas Gokal was born in 1936, in the erstwhile British India. He was born into a Shia family. During the Partition of India, the Gokal family moved to Iraq. When the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown, the Gokal family moved to Karachi, Pakistan. Gokal had brothers; Mustafa and Murtaza Gokal.  Gulf International Holdings  The three brothers: Abbas, Mustafa and Murtaza Gokal, had set up the Gulf Group (officially Gulf International Holdings) in Karachi. In 1969, they started the Gulf Shipping Lines, the flagship company of the Gulf business group. Gulf Shipping Lines was registered and headquartered in Geneva. In the beginning, the company used to transport cargo through the Arabian Sea from Karachi. Gulf Shipping Lines was well known for shipping to ports in which other companies were hesitant to ship to. A notable example was Iran. The Gulf Shipping Lines was the prime shipping company that shipped cargo to and from Iran during the decade-long Iran‚ÄìIraq War. The Gokal brothers envisioned the Gulf Shipping Lines as an international shipping empire, and the company soon expanded all over the Third World. But in the 1980s, the Gulf Shipping Lines was having financial trouble due to the international shipping crisis. In 1984, the company had reached a crisis-point when its creditors sought their money back. That is when the BCCI came to their aid. The Gokal family's relationship with BCCI founder and chairman, Hasan Abedi, dated back to the 1960s. Due to the financial backing, the Gulf Shipping Lines controlled more than 240 vessels.https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1991/07/24/imperium-van-de-gebroeders-gokal- op-de-klippen-6974781-a342929 By the early 1980s, the Gulf Group had diversified into many different sectors. These sectors included commodities trading, retailing, hotels, mining and real-estate. Thanks to this business diversification, Gokal's personal fortune was estimated to be over ¬£20 million, while his business group was worth billions. His credit card bills amounted to over ¬£250,000.  BCCI scandal  In 1991, the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International was shut down by its regulators. It was discovered that the bank was running on loss for many years. It used to give out phoney loans, concealed deposits and hid their huge losses, which ran into billions of dollars. The bank was alleged to hide and launder the money of dictators, drug lords, and even terrorists. One of the main men behind the collapse was Abbas Gokal. The Gulf Group had an almost US$1.2 billion loan from the BCCI. He was the single largest borrower, and the loans were used to fund his own lifestyle instead of his company. The bank's auditors, Price Waterhouse, discovered that the bank had given them US$1.2 billion via 700 offshore companies. This money used to be funneled into the Gulf Group like a 'giant washing machine'. When the bank collapsed, the Gulf Group collapsed with it. As the scandal was discovered, Swiss Police raided the Gulf Group head office in Geneva. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi (one of the main investors in the BCCI) himself lost ¬£312 million to the Gulf Group's collapse. Gokal and his two brothers had escaped to Karachi. Bank of England officials and the Serious Fraud Office wanted Gokal on trial. However, he could not be extradited to Britain as it had no extradition treaty with Pakistan. Gokal had agreed to travel to the United States for an interview with an attorney. He was said to have information on corrupt American officials. On 18 July 1994, he left for the United States. When his plane had stopped for refuelling at Frankfurt, German police arrested him and had him extradited to the United Kingdom.  Trial and imprisonment  Gokal was tried in May 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to funnel money out of the BCCI, which later contributed to the bank's collapse. He was sentenced to fourteen years in jail and confiscation of all his assets. His two brothers, Mustafa and Murtaza, were safe in Pakistan. His sentence was the longest sentence that a British court handed out for fraud. Gokal served his sentence at the high-security Whitemoor Prison in Cambridgeshire.  Release  Gokal was released from imprisonment in the UK in 2003. He served only 9 years of his 14-year sentence. He was reported to be living in West London as of 2003.http://www.tradewindsnews.com/weekly/184021/bcci-fraudster-abbas-gokal- goes-free  Personal life  Abbas Gokal is married to Rukaiya Gokal. They both have a daughter, Sukaiyna. Sukaiyna works in the ship management sector of Univan Ship Management. Gokal was noted to be a family-oriented man. The judge that sentenced him even noted and appreciated the fact that Gokal always put his family above everything.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/bcci-fraudster-jailed- for-record-14-years-and-fined-pounds-3m-1260499.html Gokal's affluence extended to having a house on New York's Fifth Avenue, multiple houses in London and Connecticut,https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/soc.culture.pakistan/j9MPSHgoqdE private jets and Rolls- Royces.https://www.apnews.com/56e22467b09201abe3adb2257f10c296 One of his brothers, Mustafa Gokal, served as the financial advisor to President Zia-ul- Haq and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Coming from a Shia Muslim background, the Gokal's are Khoja Ithna'Asheri. Abbas Gokal's uncle, Shaheed Abdul Hussein Gokal, was martyred in Iraq. He was a greatly respected philanthropist and religious activist, and his loss was mourned by many across Iraq and the subcontinent. The family was forced to leave Iraq. The Gokal's were amongst the first Muslim families in the Indian subcontinent to rally behind Ayatollah Khomeini's banner, after the Islamic Revolution.

It dates from the 12th century and stands on the march of the municipality Waldburg in the district of Ravensburg, applies as one of the best preserved medieval buildings, and is one of the landmarks and the highest point in Upper Swabia. Geographical situation The hill castle on the top of the drumlin from northwest The Waldburg is a Hilltop castle located on a natural elevation, a drumlin from the last glacial period, at height above sea level. The raised situation with view (when suitable weather conditions) to the west up to the Hohentwiel near Singen, to the north up to the Ulm Minster, to the east far back in the Alpine foothills and southwards far into the Swiss Alps and the Lake Constance made the Waldburg to an important trigonometric point also for land surveying in the early 19th century of the ordnance survey. The steepen drumlin already offers by his very big slope angle an almost ideal military protection for a castle construction, however, complicated also the building and expansion more than seven centuries considerably. The hill castle was very woody till the eighties of the 20th century. The view at the castle was moved again in the old condition for the public reopening in 1996 by specific deforestation in the beginning of the nineties. During the day, as well as at night with lighting, the castle is a very striking and important landmark in Upper Swabian. History Historical view from north-east, painting by Johann Georg Sauter, 1845. The first foundation of the castle goes back to the 11th century. In this time the family of Waldburg received an official fief from the Guelphs. In the first half of the 13th century the castle was radically rebuilt, the palas was anew established up to the second upper floor. Under Emperor Frederick II the Imperial Regalia were kept in the castle from 1220 to at least 1240. In 1327 the church Saint Magnus was built at feet of the castle. At the middle of the 16th century under steward Georg IV of Waldburg the castle was developed to a residence similar like a palace. From the 17th century the castle was inhabited only sporadically by the family of Waldburg and the building activity decreased. Present utilization Prince Johannes zu Waldburg-Wolfegg speaks about his family's ownership of the Waldseem√ºller map in the Great Hall at the reception of the Thomas Jefferson Building for the opening of the Lewis and Clark exhibition. Today the Schloss accommodates a museum and is opened for sightseeing during the warm seasons from early April until late October. Guided tours are held on weekends and holidays at 1:30 pm and 3:00 pm. At the top of the roof there is a vista platform with a look around as far as eye can see. The museum shows exhibits to the history of the castle from the Middle Ages on the basis of documents, paintings as well as fitments and basic commodities and to the development of the ordnance survey. The walking tour begins in the ground floor with the late Middle Ages and ends in the third upper floor with the collections of the 19th and 20th century. The Holy Lance, the Imperial Sceptre and the Imperial Orb are exhibited as replicas, since 2013 there is also presented a copy of the Imperial Crown. A special feature of the exhibition is a Facsimile of the printed wall map of the world by German cartographer Martin Waldseem√ºller where the continent and the name America appeared for the first time, originally published in April 1507. The Federal Republic of Germany consigned the original in 2007 to the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. The castle chapel is used for church weddings. Parts of the museum and the vaults are also available for wedding celebrations. The Burgschenke, the castle inn, is the former kitchen in the imperial castle; there are offered dishes after original recipes of the Medieval cuisine.

He was described as the \\"President of Soul\\". Early years Charles was born in Boothville, Louisiana and learned to play guitar from his father, Earlington, a travelling bluesman who played juke joints in the segregated Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. Charles moved to New Orleans aged 13, where he shared the stage with fellow teenagers Ernie K-Doe and Aaron Neville at talent contests which were frequently held at Lincoln Beach, the African-American amusement park near Lake Ponchartrain during segregation. His early influences were Earl King and Chuck Berry. Charles dropped out of high school in the 10th grade and moved to Venice, Louisiana. He returned to New Orleans aged 18 and started the band The Gadges. Career According to the New Orleans Time Picyaune, Charles was turned down by Dave Bartholomew at Imperial Records and Allen Toussaint at Instant and Minit. He instead signed with Senator Jones' Black Patch label in the mid-1960s and released the singles \\"Mr. Rickashay\\" and \\"Sinking Like A Ship.\\" After releasing records with Black Patch, Charles relocated to Nashville, where he backed performers including O.V. Wright, Little Johnny Taylor, and Roscoe Shelton. He returned to New Orleans in 1970, and set up his own label, Soulgate, on which he had a local hit with \\"The President of Soul\\". During the 1970s and 1980s he worked as a tugboat captain and oyster fisherman, while playing in various jazz and blues clubs. His recording career resumed in 1994 after New Orleans Records producer Carlo Ditta responded to an advertisement Charles had placed in a local entertainment magazine. This led to the release of his debut solo LP, Born for You in 1996. He subsequently recorded two albums with Louie Fontaine in 2003 and 2006.

The garden was established to recognize and develop the historic and ongoing relationship between the people of Cowra Shire and the people of Japan. Background The garden was designed by Ken Nakajima (1914‚Äì2000) in the style of the Edo period as a kaiy≈´-shiki or strolling garden. The rocky hillside, manicured hedges, waterfalls, streams, and lakes provide a serene environment for a variety of aquatic birds. Special features of the garden include a Bonsh≈ç (bell), a traditional Edo cottage, an authentic open air tea house, and a Bonsai house. History In 1960 the Japanese Government decided to bring all their war dead from other parts of Australia to be re-buried at Cowra, which already featured a cemetery for the remains of 231 Japanese soldiers killed during the 1944 Cowra breakout from the nearby prisoner of war camp. The Japanese War Cemetery was maintained after World War II by members of the Cowra Returned and Services League of Australia, and ceded to Japan in 1963. In 1971 Cowra Tourism Development decided to celebrate this link to Japan, and proposed a Japanese garden for the town. The Japanese government agreed to support this development as a sign of thanks for the respectful treatment of their war dead, with the development also receiving money from the Australian government and private entities. The Cowra Japanese Garden and Cultural Centre opened in 1979, and the second stage opened in 1986. Festivals An annual Sakura Matsuri (cherry blossom festival) is held in the gardens during September and celebrates the arrival of spring. The garden hosts Girl's Day and Boy's Day festivals, tea ceremonies, demonstrations, and workshops on traditional Japanese crafts, including calligraphy, origami, and Ikebana, as well as garden talks.

It forms one of the territory's Important Bird Areas (IBAs), which encompasses the forest reserve as well as additional habitat for the Montserrat oriole, the territory's endemic, and critically endangered, national bird. Description The 1112 ha IBA comprises the largest remnant of Montserrat's native forest. It encompasses the highlands of the northern half of the island from an elevation of 150 m up to the 741 m summit of Katy Hill. The terrain is steep, largely trackless, and riven by the ‚Äòghauts‚Äô, or ravines, that radiate into the islands's northern lowlands. Rainfall increases with altitude, and the vegetation changes from tropical dry forest at the lower elevations, through tropical evergreen forest to elfin forest at the summit. Most of the forest is secondary or regrowth, following historic land clearance for plantation agriculture, and at a variety of successional stages because of damage from frequent hurricanes. Other IBAs on the island are the Northern Forested Ghauts and South Soufriere Hills. =Birds= The IBA was identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports, as well as Montserrat orioles, populations of bridled quail-doves, purple-throated caribs, green-throated caribs, Antillean crested hummingbirds, Caribbean elaenias, scaly-breasted thrashers, pearly-eyed thrashers, brown tremblers, forest thrushes and Lesser Antillean bullfinches.

It originally aired on November 11, 2010. The episode was written by Andrew Chambliss and directed by J. Miller Tobin. Plot The episode starts with a flashback to Bulgaria in 1490 where Katerina (Nina Dobrev) gives birth to a baby girl but her father takes it away immediately because the pregnancy brought shame to the family. Back to the present, Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and Stefan (Paul Wesley) call Elena to their home to inform her about what Rose (Lauren Cohan) told them. Rose tries to convince them that Klaus is really dangerous and Elijah (Daniel Gillies) is nothing in front of him but the Salvatores try to calm Elena down by saying that nothing of these might be true. Rose warns them again and Elena leaves for High School rejecting Stefan's offer to go with her for protection. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) asks Bonnie (Kat Graham) to play pool with him after school and Bonnie agrees. Their conversation gets interrupted by a new student, Luka (Bryton James), who asks for directions for the school's office. Later on, Bonnie gets to the Grill but Jeremy is not there yet so she sits with Luka who introduces his father Jonas (Randy J. Goodwin ) to her. Jonas gets weird by asking about Bonnie's family from Salem. Jeremy arrives and Bonnie gets the chance to get away but before she leaves, she touches Luka's shoulder and she gets a strange feeling about him. Elena wants to know if what Rose said about Klaus is true and plans to go talk to Katherine. She asks Caroline's (Candice Accola) help by asking her to not tell Stefan where she is. Caroline does not agree with Elena's plan but she promises to keep her secret. They arrive at the tomb where Katherine is locked and Caroline opens the door. Elena reassures her that she will be safe and Caroline leaves. Elena asks Katherine about Klaus and even if Katherine is not willing to start talking, she changes her mind when Elena offers her some blood she brought with her. Katherine starts saying her story, that started back in England in 1492. Her father had kicked her out of the house after she gave birth to her little girl and she traveled to England where she met Klaus but when she found out why he wanted her around, she ran away to save her life. 1492: Katerina runs in the woods and tries to hide from Elijah and his loyal followers. Trevor (Trent Ford) appears and misleads them to the opposite direction and helps Katerina escape. He tells her to go to a cottage not far away where she will be safe. Katerina gets there and finds Rose who is upset by Trevor's actions and tells Katerina that she will turn her back to Klaus that night. Present: Katherine tells Elena that Klaus wanted to sacrifice her to break the vampire curse and that is exactly what he wants to do now to Elena. The doppelganger was created because the curse was bound with Petrova blood and only with Petrova blood will break. Elena wonders why the Originals want to break the curse since they are already able to walk in the sun and Katherine explains that whoever breaks the curse first binds the other species to stay cursed forever and that's why the Originals want to break the curse before werewolves do it. Meanwhile, Caroline tries to keep Stefan busy so he won't go out searching for Elena by telling him that she told Tyler (Michael Trevino) about her being a vampire. Stefan is mad at her because she put herself in danger and also because Damon will kill her if he finds out. Caroline does everything to keep Stefan with her but he can figure out that she is doing it to cover Elena. He asks her where Elena is but Caroline keeps her promise to Elena and does not tell him. Stefan leaves upset to find Elena. At the Salvatore house, Damon asks Rose how they can get in touch with Klaus. Rose says that she got in touch with Elijah via Slater (Trevor Peterson), a vampire who lives in Richmond. Damon does not waste any time and they immediately leave to find Slater. They meet him at a cafe that is built in a way that does not allow the sun burn the vampires but Trevor's contacts stop to Elijah and he does not know how to reach Klaus. Outside the cafe, Elijah listens to the whole conversation between Damon, Rose and Slater and he is not happy with what is happening. He throws some coins at the cafe's windows breaking them, something that lets the sun pass through and the vampires start burning. Slater manages to run away and Damon covers Rose and takes her out of the reach of sun. Rose is upset because she knows Klaus is behind this and he will kill them all. Back at the tomb, Katherine continues her story; 1492: Katerina stabs herself because she prefers to die than go back to Klaus. Rose does not let her die and gives her her blood to heal her when Trevor arrives and tells Rose that he loves Katerina and he wants to help her run away. While Rose tries to talk sense to him, Katerina gets the opportunity and suicides, triggering her own transformation to a vampire since she knows that as a vampire she would be useless to Klaus. Katerina wakes up a little later and Rose and Trevor realize that she used both of them to achieve her goal; become a vampire. Rose tries to stake her but Katerina gets away. Back on the present, Elena is shocked that Katherine killed herself and ruined Rose and Trevor's lives but Katherine says that everything she did was to protect herself, something she will always do. Elena guesses that Katherine's return was to hand her over to Klaus something that Katherine does not deny. Elena asks what else is needed to break the curse and Katherine says: a doppelganger (Elena), a vampire (Caroline), a werewolf (Mason but since Damon killed him, she turned Tyler), a witch (Bonnie) and the moonstone. Luka gets back to the Grill to apologize to Bonnie for his father's earlier behavior and he also reveals that he and his father are warlocks who just try to fit to their new home. Bonnie believes him and the two of them start talking and getting closer, while Jeremy watches from afar. Stefan figures out where Elena is and gets to the tomb. He tells Elena that whatever Katherine told her is a lie because she is a liar and that he will do everything to protect her. Katherine interrupts him to tell him that Elena is doomed and he cannot do anything about it. She finishes her story by telling them that when she run away, Klaus went to her home and killed everyone she loved. She reassures them that Klaus will do the same to Elena's family and friends if he cannot get to her. Katherine offers them the moonstone but Stefan accuses her that she only gives it to them to trade it with her freedom but Katherine points out that her being trapped in the tomb makes her the safest vampire in town when Klaus comes to kill everyone, since he won't want to get into a tomb where he will not be able to get out. Damon and Rose are back at the Salvatore house and they end up kissing and have sex. Later, while they talk, Slater calls Rose to tell her that he doesn't want to be involved in their plans but he tells her that if they want to destroy the curse they will have to get the moonstone and a witch. He hangs up the phone and it's revealed that Elijah is there with him who compelled him to say those things to Rose. Elijah also compels Slater to stake himself, something that Slater does and dies. The episode ends with Jonas entering the room asking Elijah if it was necessary to kill Slater and Elijah says that it was.

The usage often carries connotations of corruption or cronyism (That highway deal is pure janaratna.), particularly involving politicians and wealthy entrepreneurs.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Leamington, Ontario, but due to possible confusion with , she was given a name associated with the town. Following the war, she was sold to the Chilean Navy and renamed Covadonga. Originally named Megantic, she was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943‚Äì1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 20 July 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec and launched 7 August 1944. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 26 September 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up in Bermuda in November 1944, Sea Cliff was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-3 and began work as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort in December. She remained in this service until May 1945 when she returned to Canada. She was sent to Liverpool, Nova Scotia to begin a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant adding refrigeration and water-cooling capabilities and changing the camouflage. The refit was started on 10 June, however due to the surrender of Japan, it was stopped on 28 August 1945. Sea Cliff was paid off 28 November 1945 at Halifax, Nova Scotia and placed in reserve at Shelburne. Postwar service Sea Cliff was sold to Chile 30 March 1946 and renamed Covadonga. She arrived on 25 June 1946 and began service with the Chilean Navy. She participated in the first Chilean Antarctic Expedition in which the Base General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme was established. She served until 1968 when she was sold and turned into a wharfside pontoon. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

Built between 1792 and 1800, it is a rare 18th century meeting house in New Hampshire, although it has been altered somewhat and moved (in 1845) from its original location; it was said to originally be a near duplicate of the Rockingham Meeting House in Vermont. Construction of the timber frame building was repeatedly delayed due to a shortage of funding. It first served as a combined religious and civic meeting house, with ownership residing with the society of pew owners. When it was moved in 1845, a number of alterations were made. Its box pews were removed, a second floor was added at the gallery level, and stair locations were changed. The upper level was then used for church services. It is at this time that the building probably received its Greek Revival features. In 1890 the building was sold to the Jones family, who converted the upper level into a more secular auditorium space. The gallery was enlarged, and the stage area was improved for use in theatrical productions. A heating system was added, and the church spire was removed. The Joneses donated the building to the town in 1897. The upper level is used for community events, and the lower level houses the town library. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Founded in 1348 at the same time as the university itself, it is the oldest medical faculty in Central Europe and the 11th oldest medical institution in the world. Situated in the centre of Prague, the faculty provides education in all fields of general medicine. It is regularly ranked in the top 1% of medical faculties globally. It is one of the five medical faculties of Charles University, alongside the Second and Third Faculties, both in Prague, and faculties in Plzen and Hradec Kralove. It has two student associations. One for the Czech parallel (SMC) and one for the English parallel (LF1 MEDSOC). The student associations have their offices in Faust House and are responsible for helping new students get used to the university life as well as organise all the parties and activities, including Freshers Week every September.  History  Charles University was established in 1348 and a medieval faculty of medicine was one of the four founding faculties (with the Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Law, and Faculty of Theology). In 1882, as part of the division of the university during the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a separate German faculty was founded. The two parallel faculties, one German and one Czech, remained until the foundation of the independent state of Czechoslovakia in 1918, when the German faculty was disbanded. In 1953 the former Faculty of Medicine in Prague was divided into three medical faculties: the Faculty of General Medicine, the Faculty of Pediatric Medicine, and the Faculty of Hygiene. Following the Velvet Revolution, these three faculties evolved into the First, Second and Third Faculty of Medicine, respectively. Admissions Admission to the faculty is based on performance in high school (Biology, Chemistry and Physics), English proficiency and performance in entrance exams. Entrance examinations are conducted at the university and by some representative offices abroad, and are considered to be among the hardest university entrance exams in Europe.http://www.medicaldoctor-studies.com/p/18/charles-university- in-prague After the entrance exams, interviews are conducted with successful candidates. Most of the international students studying medicine at the institute originate from USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Israel, Malaysia, India and the Middle East.  Academics  Around 3400 students are enrolled in the First Faculty of Medicine. Most teaching facilities are located in the centre of Prague, near Charles Square, I. P. Pavlova and Albertov. The majority of clinical instruction takes place at the General University Hospital in Prague, and other teaching hospitals include the Military University Hospital in Prague, Thomayer Teaching Hospital, Bulovka Hospital and Motol University Hospital. The faculty runs bachelor's and master's degree programmes, and several Ph.D. study programmes. The two main study programmes at the faculty are General Medicine and Dentistry, taught either in English or Czech. The Medicine program lasts for 6 years, and Dentistry for 5 years.

It was published by Square Enix in 2014 for mobile devices and 2015 for the Vita. It is the eleventh game in the Mana series, featuring a new narrative unconnected to other games in the series. The gameplay uses a similar action-based battle system to earlier Mana titles while using a free-to-play model in common with mobile titles. The story focuses on two characters, an angel and a demon, who are cast down to the mortal world in the midst of a battle and are forced to share a body in order to survive. The game began development in 2012: the project began when Masaru Oyamada told series producer Koichi Ishii that he could create a legitimate entry in the Mana series for mobile platforms. His idea was for a game true to the series that would reach a wide audience. The game's multiplayer, inspired by that used in Secret of Mana, was developed using the Photon Server middleware. The art director was series newcomer Hiroyuki Suzuki, while the character and monster designs were done by Taiki and Ryota Murayama. The music was composed by a team led by Tsuyoshi Sekito, while the theme song was written and performed by singer-songwriter Kokia. First announced in February 2014, it was released the following month on iOS. The Android release followed several months later. The Vita port released the following year. By April 2015, the mobile version had over two million active players, and later the Vita version achieved 150,000 downloads by August 2015. It received generally positive opinions from critics: while many praised its graphics, story and gameplay, there were opinions that it was not a worthy part of the Mana series. The game was discontinued in March 2016. Gameplay Gameplay in Rise of Mana: the character in its Angel form tackles common enemies. Rise of Mana is an action role-playing game where the player takes control of two protagonists inhabiting a single body: the characters' genders and names can be customized prior to beginning the game. During gameplay, the character can switch between angelic and demonic forms: this enables the player to see thoughts in different non-player characters (NPCs), with each form showing different types of thought or prompting a different reaction from NPCs. The game uses a free-to-play gaming model: while the game can be downloaded and played for free, players have the option of spending money on in-game items. The characters' base is a room in a small village: in the room, players can check messages, and set their current equipment and weapons. A message board in the town provides access to social features. In the town, NPC-run shops enable the crafting of new weapons and equipment in exchange for in-game currency, along with the buying and selling of various in-game items. There are four types of available quests, most of which are accepted from NPCs: main quests which advance the story, quests with a time limit that disappear after a certain period, challenge quests that pit the player against hordes of enemies, and raid battles against bosses. Each quest consumes a part of the player characters' \\"mental energy\\", a stamina meter that refills as real-world time passes. Gems can be bought and used to refill it faster. When the characters gain an experience level, the meter is recharged completely. As each scenario and quest is completed or when new quests are available, the game's map is automatically updated. After selecting a quest, a player chooses one of a number of \\"familiars\\", creatures that aid the player in battle and grant stat boosts. Rise of Mana uses an action-based battle system similar to other entries in the Mana series: navigation and actions occur in real time within battlefields rendered to the scale of characters within it. After each battle, treasure chests are unlocked which can contain items or new familiars. During battle, the character can attack, switching forms to deliver different attacks, and dodge enemy attacks when correctly timed. During battle, assigned abilities are displayed in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. After each skill is used in battle, a cooldown meter is activated. The skill cannot be used again until the meter is empty. Three types of weapons are available in-game: swords, spears and bows. Each weapon, when equipped, grants a different skill and elemental attribute. The elemental attributes can be used against monsters aligned with a vulnerable element. Enemies can also be weak to attacks using certain weapons. In addition to single-player battles, raid battles allow up to eight players to participate using an online connection. Synopsis =Setting and characters= The story takes place in a variation of the Mana high fantasy setting, and is divided between the human and the spirit realms. In the spirit realm, two opposing factions face each other in eternal battle: the angelic Rasta and the demonic Daruka. The main protagonists are the chosen champions of each of their races. The two are forced to confront agents sent from the spirit realm by each side to retrieve them: the archangel knight Vibra and the warrior demon Toryu. Another major character is Folon, a being known as the \\"goddess of time\\". According to the game's director, Foron is not a goddess in the fullest sense, as the world's true goddess could be said to be \\"Mana\\" itself. =Plot= The game opens with a battle between the respective Champions of Light and Darkness in front of the Mana Tree. While they are fighting near a Mana waterfall, they are swept by it into the mortal world. There, their power is drastically diminished and their existence is threatened. The two decide to make a temporary alliance, sharing a body until they can find their way back to the spirit world. During their journey, they become the protectors of a local village. The pair eventually become the heirs to the mystical Mana Sword. The main campaign was delivered in chapters. The original main campaign, which involved a battle with the hostile Folon, lasted for twenty chapters. Following this, new campaign missions were issued following the characters' mission to confront threats using the Mana Sword. At the end of the game, the Champions confront Folon at the Mana Tree, along with Vibra and Toryu. After their final confrontation, Foron willingly disperses after she and Mana explain why they summoned the Champions: to bring them together through circumstance and pave the way for peace between the Rasta and Daruka. Having become friends through their journey, the Champions agree to bring peace, and return to their own realms. Development Rise of Mana was the brainchild of Square Enix producer Masaru Oyamada, who had made a name for himself within the company working in its mobile division on mobile ports of Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana. Speaking with series producer Koichi Ishii, Oyamada said that he could create an original mobile title that would be a legitimate entry in the series. Instead of a social or card-based game, which were the most prevalent genres in mobile gaming at the time, Oyamada wanted to create an action role-playing game that was accessible to a large number of casual gamers, something which would worry him throughout its production. The main staff were made up of Oyamada, director Masato Yagi, and art director Hiroyuki Suzuki. Hiroyuki had previously only worked on the Final Fantasy series. After the initial release of Rise of Mana, Yagi was responsible for the main scenario alongside Oyamada and post-launch content producer Naofumi Takuma. Oyamada also initially tried to bring Chaos Rings producer Takehiro Ando on board, but Ando would have nothing to do with the project. Development began in July 2012. The game was constructed using the Unity engine. In addition to staff from Square Enix, main development was done by Japanese developer Goshow, and its server security and technical assistance was handled by Fixer. The protagonists and some NPCs were designed by Japanese artist Taiki, while another artist Ryota Murayama handled NPC and monster designs. The game's key art was created by in-house designer Dairaku Masahiko: he was brought in after regular Mana key art illustrator Hiroo Isono died in 2013. Masahiko was asked by Oyamada to create something similar to Isono's previous artwork in creating a representation of pointillism. The game's title was indicative of the title's nature as a new entry in the Mana series; other than a small card- battle mobile game in 2013, Circle of Mana, Rise was the first Mana title since Heroes of Mana in 2007. Rise of Mana was intended to reach a wide audience, gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed would have taken a whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted Fixer, who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server. Trying out Photon Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two-month period, and the middleware's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team thought it would be fun to re- create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took up too much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of Photon Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers. Development of the PlayStation Vita port began shortly before the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a partnership with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of the same quality as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to the button and joystick controls of the Vita. There was also some resistance from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions that it would be better to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform's processing power. In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year. =Music= The music of Rise of Mana was composed by a group of different composers: the majority of the music was handled by Tsuyoshi Sekito. In addition to Sekito, the soundtrack was also contributed to by three previous Mana composers: Kenji Ito (Final Fantasy Adventure, Children of Mana, Dawn of Mana), Hiroki Kikuta (Secret of Mana, Trials of Mana) and Yoko Shimomura (Legend of Mana, Heroes of Mana). Also joining the team was sound engineer Yasuhiro Yamanaka. In all, 21 out of the 28 composed pieces were done by Sekito. Ito, Kikuta, Shimomura and Yamanaka each contributed one track. The soundtrack featured an arrangement for piano of \\"Rising Sun\\", the series' main theme. Yamanaka acted as sound director, while poro@lier created the piano arrangements for both \\"Rising Sun\\" and the game's theme song. The game's theme song, \\"Believe in the Spirit\\", was composed, written and sung by Japanese singer-songwriter Kokia. Prior to coming on board, she had little knowledge of the Mana series. As with her previous compositions for video games, Kokia tried to get a feel for the game's atmosphere before starting, either through playing the game directly or looking at behind-the-scenes material related to the game's world. With \\"Believe in the Spirit\\", she worked to create a song that would appeal to both players and the production team. The track was performed using strings, a tin whistle, an acoustic guitar and percussion. The arrangement was done by Mina Kubota. Seiken Densetsu: Rise of Mana Original Soundtrack was released on April 24, 2014 through Square Enix's music label. Andrew Barker of RPGFan was cautiously positive about the album: he described \\"Believe in the Spirit\\" as being \\"hit-or-miss\\" for different listeners while evoking memories of earlier Mana games. The rest of the soundtrack was generally praised: the first half's restful melodies were the stand-out tracks and said to be the strongest, while the later upbeat tracks were praised for their various energizing qualities. Some tracks, such as \\"The Drip Drip Drip of Memory\\", he called fairly weak and forgettable. Barker generally compared the music to that of Final Fantasy XII, recommending it for fans of the latter and finishing that the album was generally good despite some unmemorable pieces. Chris Greening of Video Game Music Online gave the album a 2.5-star rating out of five: he was most positive about the tracks from the guest composers like Ito and Shimomura. While he praised Sekito for moving away from his traditional musical style, he felt that the result was fairly mixed, with some tracks lacking the proper emotional drive and others \\"falling flat\\". \\"Believe in the Spirit\\" was praised for avoiding J-pop elements and sticking with its Celtic style, being favorably compared to the theme songs of Xenogears. Overall, Green felt that, while it had good production value and was substantially better than other mobile game soundtracks, but lacked the emotional impact of previous Mana titles in the majority of its tracks. Many reviewers of the game also praised the soundtrack. Release The game's existence was first hinted at when a trademark for the title was registered. Similar trademarks were registered in Europe and North America. The game was officially announced by Square Enix in an issue of Famitsu magazine in February 2014. The game's service began on March 6, 2014 for iOS. The version for Android released nearly three months later on June 25. A version for the Vita was announced later in 2014, originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of that year. Due to technical difficulties, the Vita port needed to be delayed well into the following year, and was eventually released on May 14, 2015. Pre-registration was made available from May 10. During its lifetime, Rise of Mana entered multiple collaborations with other games both for mobiles and other platforms: these included Final Fantasy Agito, Bravely Default, Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, Final Fantasy Adventure and Diffusion Million Arthur. In January 2016, it was announced that Rise of Mana would cease operation on all platforms on March 31. In the release, Square Enix said that a developing imbalance between content quality and revenue, in addition to problems with future content creation, had convinced them that Rise of Mana was no longer a profitable concern. Despite it ending service as a free-to-play title, the company was looking into alternative ways of distributing the title. A final story episode was released prior to the game's closure, and its final cinematic was released online through Square Enix Japan's YouTube channel on March 28. Reception Within the first few days of operation, Rise of Mana had 500,000 active players. Within a month of its release, that number had increased to one million registered players. In an interview, Oyamada said that sales of the title had increased with the release of more powerful mobile devices. By May 2015, the smartphone versions had over two million registered players. The Vita version was similarly successful: within two months of release, it had been downloaded 100,000 times. That figure rose by an additional 50,000 over the following month. Japanese reviews of the title have been generally positive. Famitsu generally praised several aspects, but found the item management and weapon structures confusing, saying that it did not live up to the legacy of the Mana series. Reviewing the Vita port, Famitsu praised the game's general ease of play and use of the Mana series, but the button layout was criticized. Ky≈çsuke Takano of AppGet praised the gameplay and graphics, noting that the game avoided the possible pitfalls of being a mobile game while delivering a strong experience. His one point of reservation was that he would have preferred the game on another platform. 4Gamer.net praised the variety of control options, the feel of gameplay, and the graphics. The writer noted that the game should be played on more advanced mobiles despite recommendations, as the graphics and performance suffered on older smartphone models. Opinions from western journalists have echoed many of those from Japanese reviewers. Christopher Allison, writing for tech website Tech in Asia, was highly positive about the game, saying his last experience of this kind was when playing the 1998 game The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time: he greatly enjoyed the battle system despite the touch controls sometimes working against the player, and referred to the environments as \\"wonderfully drawn\\". Shaun Musgrave of Touch Arcade, in a preview of the game, echoed other reviewers' opinions on the graphics and gameplay, and hoped that Square Enix would both handle it wisely and bring it overseas. Kerry Brunskill, in an article for Nintendo Life, referred to the story as \\"engaging\\", and again held similar sentiments as other reviewers about the graphics and gameplay. She noted that the game stood out from others of its kind due to its overall quality.

Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 88-89 Allen Lane 2012 History For most of its history, Barbera Sarda was thought to be a local clone of the Piedmont wine grape Barbera (pictured). Until the late 20th and early 21st century, Barbera Sarda was thought by wine growers to be a local clone of the Piedmont wine grape Barbera with some ampelographers suggesting that it could also be related to Carignan, known in parts of Italy as Mazuelo. However, DNA analysis has shown that Barbera Sarda is a distinct variety with no close genetic relationship with either grapes or to any of the many other grapes that are various known as Barbera. Some ampelographers still believe that the grape could potentially be an offspring of the Piedmontese Barbera even though, as of 2012, there has been no DNA evidence to support that theory. Viticulture Barbera Sarda is a late ripening grape variety that maintains high levels of acidity even when it is harvested late in the growing season. Wine regions Barbera Sarda is a recommended grape variety in several Sardinian provinces. Today, Barbera Sarda is found almost exclusively on the island of Sardinia where it is a recommended grape variety for wine production in the provinces of Cagliari, Nuoro, Oristano and Sassari. While the grape can be made as a varietal, it is most often used in blends where the grapes naturally high acidity can add balance to the wines.

The bridge is located at the meeting point of the townlands of Clonmoyle East (which lies within the civil parish and catholic parish of Aghabullogue) and Killeenleigh (which lies within the civil parish and catholic parish of Donoughmore). The Ordnance Survey name book (c. 1840) names it as Athnanagul. A river ford, crossing the Dripsey River, existed here until recent times, and is depicted as 'Athnanangle Ford' and 'Stepping Stones' on the OS 1841 surveyed map. This was replaced by Athnanangle Bridge, which had been constructed by the beginning of the twentieth century. Milner (1975) describes Athnanangle as an ancient ford which tradition associated with St. Olan of Aghabullogue and St. Lachteen of Donoughmore, being the meeting place where they marked the dividing line between their respective parishes of Aghabullogue and Donoughmore. The Irish Tourist Association survey of 1944 gives some local folklore, as to a 'misunderstanding' between the two Saints on the question of division of parochial territories. St. Lachteen, believing a portion of his territory to be wrongfully obtained by St. Olan, is said to have remarked 'there will always be a robber at Aghabullogue', with St. Olan, considering his neighbour difficult to deal with, replying that 'Donoughmore will always have its mad dogs'. Local tradition had it that any dog showing signs of hysteria was to be faced towards Donoughmore. Many surviving bridges in mid-Cork are originally constructed of stone, arched in shape, and late eighteenth or early nineteenth century in date. Athnanangle Bridge does not fit within this category, being of later construction date.

It was developed and built for Spacecom by NPO PM, the largest Russian satellite producer, at a cost of $157 million. The satellite was positioned at the 17¬∞ East longitude in the geostationary belt. It was launched on 11 December 2011, 11:17 UTC from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, atop a Proton-M/Briz-M launch vehicle. It provided coverage over the continent of Africa, as well as Europe and the Middle East. Following failure of power generator 1, generator 2 was activated in May 2012. Power generator 2 also developed faults in September 2012 and October 2013 and the satellite's initial lifespan of 15 years was expected to be shortened by 11 months. However all communications with the Amos-5 satellite were lost on 21 November 2015. The satellite was visualized in its expected location, moving in an uncontrolled fashion, most likely due to power failure. Three weeks later, Spacecom announced that the satellite had failed completely. It is expected to continue to orbit at an altitude of 42,000 km for the foreseeable future.

He assigns the reason, why he had denied that they sacrificed to God in the wilderness. \\"Did ye offer sacrifices unto Me, and ye bare?\\" that is, seeing that ye bare. The two were incompatible. Since they did \\"carry about the tabernacle of their king,\\" they did not really worship God. He whom they chose as \\"their king,\\" was their god.Barnes, Albert. Notes on the Old Testament. London, Blackie & Son, 1884.

The Hebrew word rendered \\"tabernacle\\" (sikkuth). which is found nowhere else, has been variously explained.

Many moderns render, \\"stake,\\" \\"column,\\" or \\"shrine.\\" Others suppose it to be equivalent to Sakkuth, an Assyrian name for Molech (or Adar); but this is very uncertain (see 'Studien und Kritiken.' 1874, p. 887), sad the parallelism requires the word to be an appellative and not a proper name. It most probably means \\"shrine,\\" a portable shrine, like those spoken of in in connection with the worship of Diana. The Syriac and Arabic versions call it \\"tent,\\" and thus the reproach stands forth emphatically that, instead of, or in conjunction with, the true tabernacle, they bore aloft, as if proud of their apostasy, the tabernacle of a false god. Such shrines were used by the Egyptians, according to Herodotus (2:63, where see Rawlinson's note) and Diod. Sic. (1:97). Many such may be seen in the Egyptian room of the British Museum. Keil quotes Drumann, 'On the Rosetta Inscription,' p. 211, \\"These were small chapels, generally gilded and ornamented with flowers and in other ways, intended to hold a small idol when processions were made, and to be carried or driven about with it.\\" Hence we must look to Egypt as the source of this idolatry.Joseph S. Exell; Henry Donald Maurice Spence-Jones (Editors). The Pulpit Commentary. 23 volumes. First publication: 1890. * \\"The star of your god\\": R. Isaac Caro says all the astrologers represented Saturn as the star of Israel. Probably there was a figure of a star on the head of the image of the idol, to represent the planet Saturn; hence \\"images\\" correspond to \\"star\\" in the parallel clause. A star in hieroglyphics represents God (). \\"Images\\" are either a Hebraism for \\"image,\\" or refer to the many images made to represent Chiun.Robert Jamieson, Andrew Robert Fausset; David Brown. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown's Commentary On the Whole Bible. 1871. * \\"Chiun\\": This is the same with \\"Chevan\\", which in the Arabic and Persic languages is the name of \\"Saturn\\", as Aben Ezra and Kimchi say; and is so rendered by Montanus here; and who in the Egyptian tongue was called Revan, or Rephan, or Remphan; as by the Septuagint here, and in ; some read it Cavan, and take it to signify a \\"cake\\"; in which sense the word is used in ; and render it, \\"the cake of your images\\";\\"placentam imagiuum vestrarum\\", Pagninus, Tigurine version, Vatablus. and supposing that it had the image of their gods impressed upon it. Calmet interprets it \\"the pedestal of your images\\";Calmet. Dictionary, in the word \\"Chiun\\". and indeed the word has the signification of a basis, and is so rendered by some;\\"Basim imaginum vestrarum\\", Junius & Tremellius, Piscator; \\"statumen\\", Burkius. and is applicable to Mo/Moloch their king, a king being the basis and foundation of the kingdom and people; and to the sun, intended by that deity, which is the basis of the celestial bodies, and of all things on earth. Some take Mo and Chiun to be distinct deities, the one to be the sun, the other the moon; but they seem rather to be the same, and both to be the Egyptian ox, and the calf of the Israelites in the wilderness, the image of which was carried in portable tents or tabernacles, in chests or shrines; such as the Succothbenoth, or tabernacles of Venus, ; and those of Diana's, .John Gill.

During World Wars I and II the site was used for the executions of civilians, prisoners and captured members of the resistance. History The first range was started in 1859 by Charles Rogier (Belgian minister of defence) and the mayor of Schaerbeek (Eugene Dailly) at the Prince Baudouin barracks in the '. This first range was abandoned in 1886 by the government due to obsolescence. Modernisation of weapons meant that longer ranges were required. The shooting commission (Commission du Tir) decided to build a larger venue to permit members of the Garde Civique to practise over longer distances. In 1886 work was begun on a plateau at Linthout on the modern Reyerslaan. The centre opened in 1889. The building included a indoor range which was used by the Garde Civique and army until 1945. In 1963 the centre was demolished. The site is now occupied by a media complex for the Belgian public service television RTBF and VRT. The centre had become a focus of Belgian patriotism. During both world wars it had been under the control of the occupying German forces and was used for executions. Amongst those executed at the site were the English nurse Edith Cavell (on 12 October 1915) and Gabrielle Petit (on 1 April 1916). In World War II, prisoners held at the Prison of Saint-Gilles were taken to the Tir national to be executed. The only remaining building is dedicated to Edith Cavell.

Life  Both Schnibben's father Georg and his mother Elfriede Schnibben who died when he was twelve years old, were dedicated Nazis. Only after the death of his father did Schnibben learn that both of his parents were involved shortly before the war ended in a politically motivated murder of an unarmed civilian, in which the father was a volunteer of \\"Freikorps Adolf Hitler\\" to which the main perpetrators belonged, as Schnibben reported in a detailed essay in the magazine \\"Der Spiegel\\" in April 2014 Cordt Schnibben: Mein Vater, ein Werwolf.

History The center was developed in phases in the early 1990s. The buildings of the Village Arcade complex were owned by Weingarten Realty while a subsidiary of Rice University owned the land itself. Weingarten had a ground lease with options to renew the center until 2040. David Kaplan of Cite wrote in 1996 that the development \\"has become a lightning rod of controversy, representing either the glories or the perils of progress.\\" Kaplan stated that the Rice Village development paralleled the teardowns of smaller older houses and replacements with larger houses in surrounding neighborhoods. In 2014 Rice University announced that it was acquiring the Village Arcade shopping center from Weingarten Realty. Rice University opted to buy Weingarten out of its lease, paying $55‚Äì60 million. This means the university also owns the property in addition to the land. Composition Village Arcade The Village Arcade is a pink brick shopping center. The Village Arcade occupies an area bounded by Kirby Drive, Amherst, Morningside, and University. The development also occupies most of the block bounded by Kelvin, Amherst, Times, and Morningside. Kaplan wrote that compared to other developments in Rice Village, it is a \\"monolith\\". Tenants As of 2013 it includes tenants such as Banana Republic, The Gap, La Madeleine, and Starbucks. As of 2001 The Gatsby Social Club, previously the Cody's in the Village, is located on the complex's top floor. As of 1996 it includes national chains such as Eddie Bauer, Express, Gap, Starbucks, Structure, and Victoria's Secret.

It is also native to central Mexico and Guatemala.Flora Mesoamericana: BrassicaceaeFlora of North America Its total U.S. population was last estimated at fewer than 300 individuals. It was federally listed in California, as an endangered species of the United States in 1993. Some sources spell the epithet with a single \\"l\\" as \\"gambelii,\\" others with a double \\"ll\\" as \\"gambellii.\\" Watson, in the original 1876 publication, spelled it with a double \\"l\\" and stated that it was named after \\"Gambell,\\" collector of the type specimen. The collector was in fact William Gambel. Section 60.7 of the ICN states that such errors in the spelling of personal names is to be corrected only in the case of the omission of the final letter of the person's name. This is not what happened here. Watson added an extra letter rather than deleting a letter. Hence Watson's error must stand uncorrected in the scientific epithet, though no such rules apply to the common name. Nasturtium gambellii is a perennial herb growing decumbent to erect, its branching stems reaching up to 2 meters long. It is aquatic or semi-aquatic, its herbage sometimes floating on standing water or sprawling over wet ground. The leaves are up to 10 centimeters long and each is divided into several pairs of toothed, pointed leaflets. The inflorescence is a raceme of flowers with spoon-shaped white petals each just under a centimeter long. The fruit is a long, narrow, cylindrical silique which may be 3 centimeters long but less than 2 millimeters wide. It contains up to 20 minute seeds, the fruit narrowing between each. The plant reproduces via seed or vegetatively by sprouting from spreading shoots.Sereno Watson. 1876.

Due to the spatial limitations imposed on these simulators, perceived discrepancies between the motion of the simulator and that of the vehicle can occur and lead to simulator sickness. It is similar to motion sickness in many ways, but occurs in simulated environments and can be induced without actual motion. Symptoms of simulator sickness include discomfort, apathy, drowsiness, disorientation, fatigue, and nausea. These symptoms can reduce the effectiveness of simulators in flight training and result in systematic consequences such as decreased simulator use, compromised training, ground safety, and flight safety. Pilots are less likely to want to repeat the experience in a simulator if they have suffered from simulator sickness and hence can reduce the number of potential users. It can also compromise training in two safety-critical ways: # It can distract the pilot during training sessions. # It can cause the pilot to adopt certain counterproductive behaviors to prevent symptoms from occurring. Simulator sickness can also have post-training effects that can compromise safety after the simulator session, such as when the pilots drive away from the facility or fly while experiencing symptoms of simulator sickness.  Origins  Though human-piloted aviation has existed since the early 20th century, simulator sickness did not arise as an issue for pilots until much later when the first fixed-base simulators were created. Bell Aircraft Corporation created a helicopter simulator for the Navy during the 1950s, and it was found \\"that a large number of observers (mostly helicopter pilots) experienced some degree of vertigo during these demonstrations\\". Navy psychologists performed further study on the pilots who participated in these simulator exercises, and found that 28 out of 36 respondents to their evaluations experienced sickness. Additionally, psychologists found that experienced flight instructors seemed to be most susceptible. In fact, 60% of the instructors reported simulator sickness symptoms compared to only 12% of the students. \\"The SS usually occurred in the first ten minutes of a training session and frequently lasted for several hours afterward.\\" Two main theories exist about the causes of simulator sickness. The first is sensory conflict theory. Optical flow patterns generated in virtual environments typically induces perception of self-motion (i.e., vection). Sensory conflict theory holds that, when this perception of self-motion is not corroborated by inertial forces transmitted through the vestibular system, simulator sickness is likely to occur. Thus, sensory conflict theory predicts that keeping the visual and vestibular inputs in agreement can reduce the likelihood of simulator sickness experienced by users. Additionally, according to this theory, people who do not have a functioning vestibular component of their nervous system should not show either simulator sickness or motion sickness. The second theory for simulator sickness identifies postural instability as the determinant of simulator sickness. This theory notes that situations producing simulator sickness are denoted by their unfamiliarity to the participant more than the degree of sensory conflict; for example, sea sickness is, for many, a transient problem that is solved with experience to being on a ship. Thus, the novelty of the motion cues is hypothesized to lead to an inability to maintain postural control and this lack of control causes simulator sickness until the participant adapts. Key attributes here include the notation that the motions causing simulator sickness are in a nauseogenic low frequency range that overlaps with the frequency of motion within the human body as it maintains control over its posture. Experiments have measured markers of the onset of postural instability, and found that it precedes signs and symptoms of simulator sickness. At present, it is accurate to say that both‚Äîand neither‚Äîof these theories are yet adequate to fully explain and predict simulator sickness. Although it is clear which types of pilots are affected by it, and both sensory conflict theory and postural instability theory relate its onset with certain physiological conflicts, neither theory suffices to predict why these specific conflicts (vision vs. vestibular on the one hand, posture vs. control on the other) elicit sickness in the subject. Additional possibilities for elicitation of motion sickness in general (including simulator sickness) include gaze destabilization, which is disrupted if the vestibuloocular reflex gain in the nervous system is altered, moving patterns of visual stimuli, and motions that stimulate the otoliths and semicircular canals of the inner ear. It is unclear whether or not these stimuli are encountered in significant amounts in a simulator to induce sickness in the expert pilots. However, since laboratory studies have shown the removal of the vestibular projection areas of the cerebellum (in laboratory animals) to result in insusceptibility to motion sickness, it is almost certainly probable that the first of these theories holds the most promise with regard to research into the direct physiological causes of the phenomenon.  Effect of experience in the real and simulated environments  While anyone can experience simulator sickness, studies in flight simulators have found a correlation between the appearance of symptoms and the flight experience of the pilot. Studies conducted independently by the US Navy, US Coast Guard, and US Army during the 1980s all came to the same conclusion: the greater experience of the pilot, higher the likelihood of sickness symptoms during simulation training exercises. In 1989, the US Army released a report detailing the results of a study examining simulator sickness in UH-60 Blackhawk flight simulators, confirming the above hypothesis. The report also found that longer periods between sessions of flight simulation training resulted in greater probability of detrimental symptoms appearing increased. Research suggests that this is the body's natural way of adjusting to these systems. The bodies of experienced pilots have adapted to different types of motion experienced during actual flight conditions. When placed into a flight simulator, visual and other stimuli cause their bodies to expect the same motions associated with actual flight conditions. But their bodies instead experience the imperfect motion of the simulator, resulting in sickness. A similar situation can arise for pilots who have long gaps between simulator uses. During simulation training, the body will eventually adapt to the environment to diminish the effects of simulator sickness. However, when long periods of time are spent outside of the simulator, the body is not able to adequately adapt and symptoms will reappear. Often, adaptation is the single most effective solution to simulator sickness. For most individuals, adaptation can occur within only a few sessions, with only a minority of individuals (3‚Äì5 percent) never being able to adapt. This adaptation occurs within the psyche of the individual with repeated, controlled exposures, without any required alteration to the simulator. Through incremental exposures, dispersed regularly over a series of days, adaptation can occur faster than that of an abrupt all-encompassing exposure. However, following adaptation to the novel simulator motion environment, simulator sickness symptoms can reoccur with a return to the former environment. For this reason, simulator sickness is commonly referred to as a phenomenon of maladaptation sickness, due to incessant conflict between current and past environmental conditions. In flight training, this phenomenon can be a safety concern where it may lead to motion sickness hindering pilot performance in the real aircraft following flight simulator training.  Measurement  The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) is currently the standard for measuring simulator sickness. The SSQ was developed based upon 1,119 pairs of pre-exposure/post-exposure scores from data that were collected and reported earlier. These data were collected from 10 Navy flight simulators representing both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. The simulators selected were both 6-DOF motion and fixed-base models, and also represented a variety of visual display technologies. The SSQ was developed and validated with data from pilots who reported to simulator training healthy and fit. The SSQ is a self-report symptom checklist. It includes 16 symptoms that are associated with simulator sickness. Participants indicate the level of severity of the 16 symptoms that they are experiencing currently. For each of the 16 symptoms there are four levels of severity (none, slight, moderate, severe). The SSQ provides a Total Severity score as well as scores for three subscales (Nausea, Oculomotor, and Disorientation). The Total Severity score is a composite created from the three subscales. It is the best single measure because it provides an index of the overall symptoms. The three subscales provide diagnostic information about particular symptom categories: * Nausea subscale is made up of symptoms such as increased salivation, sweating, nausea, stomach awareness, and burping. * Oculomotor subscale includes symptoms such as fatigue, headache, eyestrain, and difficulty focusing. * Disorientation subscale is composed of symptoms such as vertigo, dizzy (eyes open), dizzy (eyes closed), and blurred vision. The three subscales are not orthogonal to one another. There is a general factor common to all of them. Nonetheless, the subscales provide differential information about participants' experience of symptoms and are useful for determining the particular pattern of discomfort produced by a given simulator. All scores have as their lowest level a natural zero (no symptoms) and increase with increasing symptoms reported.James R. Lackner, Motion Sickness, http://www.brandeis.edu/graybiel/publications/docs/190_ms_encns.pdf. Retrieved 14 April 2014.

The film features Arulnithi and Remya Nambeesan in the leading roles while Bagavathi Perumal, Singampuli, Rajkumar, and Yogi Babu play supporting roles. The film was highly panned by critics for its poor story and screenplay. The movie failed to perform well at the box office. It is loosely based on the British film Ask a Policeman (1939) and the Swedish film Kopps (2003).  Plot  The film starts with an outsider coming to the village to provide invitations to the people there. There is a police station with one sub-inspector Chelladurai (Bagavathi Perumal) and three constables. The village is winning the award from the president (Thirumurugan) for being a model village. People are very honest and hardworking, and there are no problems in the village. The policemen lead a very peaceful life because of the villagers. They work from 9 to 5 and are closed on Sundays. The police station is used for playing board games and watching TV along with the villagers. Constable Shanmugapandian (Arulnithi) is a daydreamer and has a liking to a schoolteacher named Subha (Remya Nambeesan). However, he is unable to propose to her. Since the village is clean without any crimes, the higher officials plan to transfer them to another village known for riots. Saddened by this, the four policemen create trouble for the villagers. Padhinettam Pandiyan (Singampuli) and Chelladurai ask a favor from a thief (Yogi Babu) to steal things so they can file a case, but all their attempts fail. How their actions cause change among the villagers and their lives is the rest of the film.

According to Bobo beliefs, the god Wuro created the world and then appointed his son, Dwo, to assist humanity.

Bolo masks such as this one are usually danced for entertainment Burkina Faso is a small, landlocked country north of Ghana and south of Mali and Niger. Economically, it is one of the four or five poorest countries in the world. Culturally, it is extremely rich. In part this is because so few people from Burkina have become Muslim or Christian.Roy, Christopher D. \\"Countries of Africa: Burkina Faso,\\" Art and Life in Africa, Many of the ancient artistic traditions for which Africa is so well known have been preserved in Burkina Faso because so many people continue to honor the ancestral spirits, and the spirits of nature. In great part they honor the spirits through the use of masks and carved figures. Many of the countries to the north of Burkina Faso had become predominantly Muslim, while many of the countries to the south of Burkina Faso are heavily Christian. In contrast many of the people of Burkina Faso continue to offer prayers and sacrifices to the spirits of nature and to the spirits of their ancestors. The result is that they continue to use the sorts of art that we see in museums in Europe and America. One of the principal obstacles to understanding the art of Burkina Faso, including that of the Bwa, has been a confusion between the styles of the Bwa, \\"gurunsi\\", and Mossi, and a confusion of the Bwa people with their neighbors to the west the Bobo people. This confusion was the result of the use by French colonial officers of Jula interpreters at the turn of the century. These interpreters considered the two peoples to be the same and so referred to the Bobo as \\"Bobo-Fing\\" and to the Bwa as \\"Bobo-Oule.\\" In fact, these two peoples are not related at all. Their languages are quite different, their social systems are quite different, and certainly their art is quite different. In terms of artistic styles the confusion stems from the fact that the Bwa, \\"gurunsi'\\" and Mossi make masks that are covered with red white and black geometric graphic patterns. This is simply the style of the Voltaic or Gur peoples, and also includes the Dogon and other peoples who speak Voltaic languages. Mossi Masks Mossi Mask, late 19th or early 20th century. Brooklyn Museum Masks occupy an important position in the religious life of the Nyonyose, the ancient farmers and spiritual segment of society among the Mossi people. The Nakomse (chief class) do not use masks. The use of masks in initiations and funerals is quite typical of all the Voltaic or Gur-speaking peoples, including the Nyonyose, Lela, Winiama, Nouna, Bwaba, and Dogon. Masks appear at burials to observe on behalf of the ancestors that proper burial procedures were carried out. They then appear at several funeral or memorial services held at regular intervals over the years after an elder has died. Masks attend to honor the deceased and to verify that the spirit of the deceased merits admission into the world of ancestors. Without a proper funeral the spirit remains near the home and causes trouble for his/her descendants. Masks are often carved of the wood of Ceiba pentandra, the faux kapokier. They are carved in three major styles that correspond to the styles of the ancient people who were conquered in 1500 by the invading Nakomse and integrated into a new Mossi society: In the north masks are vertical planks with a round concave or convex face.A mask at a funeral in the village of Kirsi in 1976. A black plastic child's doll has been added to the horns to create a karan wemba, to honor a female ancestor. In the southwest masks represent animals such as antelope, bush buffalo, and various strange creatures, are painted red, white and black. In the east, around Boulsa [3], masks have tall posts above the face to which fiber is attached, . Female masks have two pairs of round mirrors for eyes, Two female Mossi masks of the eastern style at a year-end ceremony in the village of Zegedeguin. and small masks, representing Yali, \\"the child\\" have two vertical horns. All Nyonyose masks are worn with thick costumes made of the fiber of the wild hemp, Hibiscus cannabinus, In the old days only the northern Nyonyose in Yatenga and Kaya, and the eastern people around Boulsa allowed their masks to be photographed. The people in the southwest forbade photography because it did not conform to the \\"yaaba soore\\", the path of the ancestors. Mask characters include Balinga, the Fulani woman, katre, the hyena, nyaka, the small antelope, Wan pelega, the large antelope, and many others. Now, however, masks from all three areas appear at annual public festivals such festivals as SIAO (Fr. Salon international de l‚ÄôArtisanat de Ouagadougou), Week of the Culture, and the Atypical Nights of Koudougou (Les Nuits Atypiques de Koudougou). Each Nyonyose family has its own mask, and they are charged with protecting the masks to this day. Masks are very sacred, and are a link to the spirits of ancestors and of nature.Roy, Christopher D., \\"Art of the Upper Volta Rivers,\\" 1987, Paris, Chaffin. Bwa The Bwa people live in central Burkina Faso. in years past they have been associated erroneously with the Bobo. In fact they are not related to the Bobo and all, and their languages and culture are quite different. The Bwa people speak a language in the voltaic family of languages, while the Bobo speak a language in the Mande family. The confusion was caused in the past by the inability of the French to distinguish between the two people through their Jula interpreters. The Bwa people are very similar to other peoples in Burkina Faso in their lack of centralized political authority. Traditionally they have no chiefs. In contrast the Mossi people who live just to the east, have a strong system of chiefs and kings. the result is that while the Mossi are conservative and resistant to change, the Bwa are open-minded and receptive to change. The Bwa produce several different kinds of masks, including leaf masks dedicated to the god named Dwo, Leaf masks, Bwa village of Boni, 2006 and wooden masks dedicated to the god Lanle.Bwa masks, village of Dossi, 1985 The style of the Bwa is well-known to collectors and scholars around the world. These are wooden masks that represent animals, or tall broad plank masks that represent the spirit Lanle. They are covered with red white and black graphic patterns that represent the religious laws that people in the villages must obey if they are to receive God's blessings. These well-known patterns are not decorative, they are graphic patterns in a system of writing that can be read by anyone in the community who has been initiated. They include black-and- white checkerboards, that look like a target, zig-zag patterns that represent the path of the ancestors, X patterns, and crescents. Masks are used in a variety of different contexts. They appear at funerals of senior elders both male and female. They appear at initiation's when young men and women are taught the meanings of the masks and the importance of the spirits and enter adult village society. They even appear on market days when their performances attract visitors to the local market, where they are likely to spend more cash, plus helping the economy of the community.

The region southwest of the Mossi Plateau is occupied by a number of autochthonous farmer groups that are referred to collectively by the Mossi, and in most studies, as gurunsi. The singular, gurunga, indicates that the word is of Mor√© origin (a word of the Mor√© \\"-ga, -se\\" class). The peoples that comprise the so-called gurunsi peoples include the Nuna, Nunuma, L√©la, Winiama, Sisala, Kas√©na, Nankana, and Kusas√© who share similar Gur languages. The L√©la speak L√©l√©, the Nuna speak Nuni, the Winiama speak Winien, and the Kas√©na speak Kasem. Most peoples in the area consider gurunsi a pejorative form of address, and much prefer to be called by their ethnic name. For this reason I have used the name gurunsiin italics and only as a convenient \\"handle\\". I have used the name Nunuma to refer to the Nuna peoples northwest of the Black Volta, and Nuna for those southeast of the river, because these peoples are closely related but produce masks that differ slightly in style. This distinction may or may not be valid historically and ethnographically. Bush buffalo mask of the Ivo family, village of Ouri, 1985 The major producers of masks are the L√©la, Nunuma, and Winiama in the north, and the Nuna in the south. The Sisala also once used masks, but they have virtually disappeared. The L√©la, Nunuma, Winiama and Nuna have influenced the styles, use and meaning of masks among their Bwa and Mossi neighbors. Masks carved of wood represent bush spirits, or spirits that take animal forms. These animal forms may be more naturalistic among the Nunuma and Nuna or more stylized among the L√©la and Winiama. The animals that occur most frequently are the antelope, buffalo, bush pig, hornbill, hyena, and the serpent. Some masks represent spirits that have no recognizable animal form. Whatever type is represented, masks have large round eyes surrounded by concentric circles, a short snout for animal masks, or a large, protuberant mouth for supernatural spirits. They are covered with geometric patterns painted red, white, and black, repainted every year, except among the Winiama. Some masks are surmounted by a tall plank. Masks represent protective spirits that can take animal forms or can appear as strange beings. These spirits watch over a family, clan or community, and, if the rules for their propitiation are followed correctly, provide for the fertility, health, and prosperity of the owners. Thus the masks provide for the continuity of life in the gurunsi world. Almost any unusual event can justify consultations with a diviner and the carving of a mask to represent the spirit that is responsible. When the owner of a mask dies the mask may be passed on to his son, or it may be retired to the lineage spirit house where it slowly decays. Years later a diviner may prescribe a new mask in the same form, and the old mask is taken to the local smith who produces a replacement. Then, such old masks often are sold on the antiquities market. Masks appear at numerous events throughout the dry season. They dance to drive evil forces away from the community. They participate in the funerals of male and female elders. Every three, five, or seven years, the most sacred masks of the community participate, including young men's initiations and every seven years in sacrifices to ensure the well-being of the village. Masks may appear for special reasons throughout the year. Entertainment masks appear on almost every market day to dance for the crowds of visitors. The sacred wankr masks do not appear at such popular, public performances. Lobi The Lobi people live in southwestern Burkina Faso and northern Ivory Coast and Ghana. They are extremely resistant to any sort of centralized political authority. Instead their communities are based on the laws of God. The central character in every Lobi community is the religious specialist named the Thildar.Lobi artist with a carved stool, 1984 This diviner is responsible for communication with the spirits that govern the community and protect members of each family from accidents, disease, violence, and all of the multiple threats people encounter in the harsh environment of West Africa. The Lobi represent the nature spirits whom they called Thil with figures that can be carved of wood, modeled from clay, or cast in brass. Shrine in a Lobi home, village of Dako, Burkina Faso These figures are called Boteba, and are usually housed in a dark shrine in the most remote space in the back of the family home. Larger clay figures may be kept outside, where because of the material from which they are made they are safe from theft. Brass figures are often worn on the body by members of the family. Each of these figures displays different gestures or poses, some of them may have two or even three heads, some female figures carry an infant under one arm. These unique features represent the particular talent or power of the spiritual being that they embody. A figure with two heads is twice as quick to recognize threat and to deal with it. A figure with an infant has the power to bring fertility to the women of the family. A figure holding one arm up blocks the entrance of malevolent spirits to the family home. Bobo In much of the literature on African art the group that lives in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso is called Bobo-Fing. These people call themselves Bobo. They speak a Mand√© language. The Bobo number about 110,000 people, with the great majority in Burkina Faso, although the area occupied by the Bobo extends north into Mali. The Bobo are far from homogeneous. They are an ancient amalgamation of several peoples who have assembled around a number of core clans that do not preserve any oral traditions of immigration into the area. Their language and culture are more closely related to those of their Mand√© neighbors to the north, the Bamana and Minianka, than to their Voltaic neighbors thegurunsi and Mossi, but they should be thought of as a southern extension of the Mand√© people, that live in what is now Burkina Faso, rather than an intrusive Mand√© group that has recently penetrated the region. Although over 41% of Bobo lineages claim a foreign origin, they also claim to be autochthonous. The Bobo creator God is called Wuro. He cannot be described and is not represented by sculpture. Bobo cosmogonic myths, wuro da fere, describe the creation of the world by Wuro and the ordering of his creations, which are placed in basic opposing pairs: man/spirits, male/female, village/bush, domesticated/wild, culture/nature, safety/danger, cold/hot, farmer/blacksmith. The balances between forces as they were created by Wuro are precarious, and it is easy for man, through the simplest daily acts, to pollute his world and throw the forces out of balance. Even farming, in which crops are gathered in the bush and brought into the village, can unbalance the precarious equilibrium between culture/nature, village/bush. The following summary describes the relationship between Wuro, man, and the smith. The Bobo use masks in three major contexts: masks appear at harvest time in annual rites called birewa d√¢ga. Masks participate in the male initiation, named yele d√¢ga, which is their major function. Finally, they participate in the burial (syebi) and the funeral rites (syekwe) of people who have been killed by Dwo, or of the elder priests of Dwo. This is a secondary function, and not all masks of all Bobo clans attend these rites. Masks seem to participate in funerals much more frequently in the Syankoma area in the south, near Bobo-Dioulasso, than in the north.An antelope mask performs at a funeral in the southern Bobo village of Dofigso, Spring, 1985 Leaf masks representing the initial and universal form of Dwo serve to integrate the individual into human society and to link the community of man with the natural world; fiber masks fix the individual in a social grouping, dedicated to one of the later forms of Dwo. These masks are important agents of socialization. The significance of these lessons is impressed on each new generation in the major institution of initiation. The different levels of knowledge are explained to Bobo boys in several steps spread out over a period of fifteen years. Masks play an essential role in initiation because they reestablish and reinforce the cosmic order created by Wuro, and restore the balance and the rhythms of the natural world and of the community. Each of the new steps in the initiation is punctuated by important ceremonies when the initiates dance with several types of masks. Wall Painting This tradition gives women collective pride and self-esteem manifested in the process of bambolse, a term used exclusively to describe the embellishment or decoration to add aesthetic to wall decoration. These walls are adorned with geometric designs and symbols of animals and people. Each of these symbols are representations of key parts of life in their society. The Gurensi people and their wall decorations directly relate to a woman‚Äôs ability and her investment in her community. This society is polyamorous, and this tradition gives women a chance to showcase their individuality while serving as social interaction and a way to please their husbands. The women say that this art form is a part of their life in the same way that eating or sleeping is incorporated.

The country has greater water resources than many other Middle Eastern countries; however, it is at increasing risk of shortages, particularly during the dry summers. This is due to lack of storage capacity, to increasing demand, and to climate change. Large-scale projects to improve water supply are funded by the government and by foreign agencies, and include the Greater Beirut Water Supply Project and the Litani River Authority. A large number of environmental non-government organizations have been established in Lebanon.

But in the summertime especially, there is limited water for the residents to use. The main problem is that there a few places for water to be stored. Also, much of Lebanon's drinking water flows out into the Mediterranean Sea. These problems also go along with the higher demand of water and the leaky system of pipes and reservoirs. Lebanon is in need of an upgraded water network in order to avoid chronic water shortages predicted in the year 2020. =Climate= Recently, not only has rainfall severely declined in Lebanon, but the rising climate has also been affecting the amount of water available. It is estimated that about 50% of the rainfall evaporates leaving people of Lebanon little to work with.Saleh, Kamel. ‚ÄúLebanon Faces Water Crisis‚Äù, Almonitor. Accessed April 23, 2014.

This mass number of refugees fleeing to Lebanon has created a huge strain on Lebanon's resources and according to the minister of foreign policies of Lebanon, Gebran Bassil, is still threatening Lebanon's existence today. This rising number of people in Lebanon is creating a higher demand of water, which Lebanon is unable to satisfy. In order to prevent this threat in the future, there are many projects being put in place to help Lebanon with their environmental problems.

About 40% of Lebanon's populations is located in the Greater Beirut region. Over the last forty years, the Lebanese population living in this region have experienced water shortages due to the lack of water distribution and increased demand of water. This shortage in water stems from the political conflicts that Lebanon has been experiencing over the previous years and even still today. The Greater Beirut Water Supply Project is a project the Lebanese government has been considering since the 1960s and 1990s. A request for inspection relating to GBWSP was registered by the inspection panel on November 10, 2010.It was approved on December 16, 2010, by the World Bank's board of directors. The cost of this whole project is 370 million dollars. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) will be responsible for paying about 200 million dollars and the rest will be paid by the Government of Lebanon and the Beirut Mount Lebanon Water Establishment. Lebanon‚Äôs Ministry of Energy and Water (MoEW) will be responsible for executing the project and will delegate implementation, monitoring and reporting responsibilities to the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) and the BMLWE. Improving the water supply in the Greater Beirut area would have a positive impact on about 2.1 million people, which is around half of Lebanon's population.‚ÄúLebanon: Greater Beirut Water Supply Project‚Äù, World Bank. Accessed April 27, 2014. This would also include about 350,000 people living in lower income neighborhoods. Also, many residents who live on the top floors of apartments do not receive water because of the low water pressure in the pipes. Fixing these pipes will allow residents living on top floors to have better access to water. The quality of water will also improve and be in line with international standards, while also being much more consistent. This project will also help many people in Lebanon save money. Today, in order to get clean water, many residents rely on private water for drinkable water.

This layer extends from the earth surface to a capping inversion that typically locates at a height of 1‚Äì2 km by midafternoon over land. Below the capping inversion (10-60% of CBL depth, also called entrainment zone in the daytime), CBL is divided into two sub-layers: mixed layer (35-80% of CBL depth) and surface layer (5-10% of CBL depth). The mixed layer, the major part of CBL, has a nearly constant distribution of quantities such as potential temperature, wind speed, moisture and pollutant concentration because of strong buoyancy generated convective turbulent mixing. Parameterization of turbulent transport is used to simulate the vertical profiles and temporal variation of quantities of interest, because of the randomness and the unknown physics of turbulence. However, turbulence in the mixed layer is not completely random, but is often organized into identifiable structures such as thermals and plumes in the CBL. Simulation of these large eddies is quite different from simulation of smaller eddies generated by local shears in the surface layer. Non-local property of the large eddies should be accounted for in the parameterization. Mean Characteristics The mean characteristics of the three layers of the CBL are as follows. Vertical profiles of mean variables in convective boundary layer. Adapted from Stull 1988 \\"An Introduction to Boundary layer meteorology\\" page 13 (1) The Surface layer is a very shallow region close to the ground (bottom 5 to 10% of CBL). It is characterized by a superadiabatic lapse rate, moisture decrease with height and strong wind shear. Almost all wind shear and all the potential temperature gradient in the CBL are confined in the surface layer. (2) The Mixed layer composing the middle 35 to 80% of CBL is characterized by conserved variables such as potential temperature, wind speed and moisture. (3) The Entrainment zone (or Capping inversion) can be quite thick, averaging about 40% of the depth of the CBL. It is the region of statically stable air at the top of the mixed layer, where there is entrainment of free atmosphere air downward and overshooting thermals upward. Potential temperature and wind speed have a sharp increase across the capping inversion, while moisture has a sharp decrease. Evolution CBL depth has a strong diurnal cycle with a 4-phase process growth Evolution of convective boundary layer. Adapted from Stull 1988 \\"An Introduction to Boundary layer meteorology\\" page 11 (1) Formation of a shallow mixed layer : During the early morning the mixed layer is shallow and its depth increases slowly because of the strong nocturnal stable inversion capping. (2) Rapid growth : By the late morning, the cool nocturnal air has been warmed to a temperature near that of the residual layer, so the thermals penetrate rapidly upward during the second phase, allowing the top of the mixed layer to rise at rates of up to 1 km per 15 minutes. (3) Deep mixed layer of nearly constant thickness : When the thermals reach the capping inversion at the top of the residual layer, they meet resistance to vertical motion and the mixed layer growth rate rapidly decreases. During this third phase, which spans over most of the afternoon, the mixed layer depth is relatively constant. The lapse rate of temperature in the CBL is 1¬∞/100m. (4) Decay : Turbulence generated by buoyancy which drives the mixing decays after sunset and CBL collapses as well. Turbulence in the CBL In the atmospheric boundary layer, wind shear is responsible for the horizontal transport of heat, momentum, moisture and pollutants, while buoyancy dominates for the vertical mixing. Turbulences are generated by buoyancy and wind shear. If the buoyancy dominates over shear production, the boundary layer flow is in free convection. When shear generated turbulence is stronger than those generated by buoyancy, the flow is in forced convection. Normalized turbulent kinetic energy generated by buoyancy and shear by surface buoyancy. Adapted from Stull 1988 \\"An Introduction to Boundary layer meteorology\\" page 155 In the surface layer, shear production always exceeds buoyancy production because of strong shear generated by surface drag. In the mixed layer, buoyancy generated by heating from the ground surface is the major driver of convective turbulence. Radiative cooling from the cloud tops is also an effective driver of convection. The buoyancy generated turbulence peaks in the afternoon, hence the boundary layer flow is in free convection during most of the afternoon. The up and downdrafts of boundary layer convection is the primary way in which the atmosphere moves heat, momentum, moisture, and pollutants between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. Thus, boundary layer convection is important in the global climate modeling, numerical weather prediction, air-quality modeling and the dynamics of numerous mesoscale phenomena. Mathematical simulation =Conservation equation= To quantitatively describe the variation of quantities in the CBL, we need to solve the conservation equations. The simplified form of the conservation equation for a passive scalar in typical CBL is \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\bar {c}}{\\\\partial t}=-\\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\overline {w'c'}}{\\\\partial z} where \\\\bar {c} is the mean of quantity c, which could be water vapor mixing ratio q, potential temperature \\\\theta, eastward-moving u and northward-moving v wind speed. \\\\overline {w'c'} is the vertical turbulent flux of c. We made several approximations to get the above simplified equation: ignore the body source, Bousinesq approximation, horizontal homogeneity and no subsidence. Bousinesq approximation is to ignore the density change due to pressure perturbation and keep the density change due to temperature change. This is a fairly good approximation in the CBL. The latter two approximations are not always effective in the real CBL. But this is acceptable in theoretical research. Observations show that turbulent mixing accounts for 50% of the total variation of potential temperature in a typical CBL. However, due to the randomness of turbulences and our lack of knowledge about the exact physical behavior of it, parameterization of turbulent transport is needed in model simulation. Unlike shear dominated turbulence in the surface layer, large eddies associated with rise of warm air parcels that transport heat from hot to cold, regardless of the local gradient of the background environment exit in the mixed layer. Hence the non-local counter-gradient transport should be properly represented in the model simulation. Several approaches are generally followed in numerical models to obtain the vertical profiles and temporal variations of quantities in CBL. Full mixing scheme for the whole CBL, local scheme for the shear dominated regions, non-local scheme and top-down and bottom up diffusion scheme for the buoyancy dominated mixed layer. In the full mixing scheme, all quantities are assumed to be uniformly distributed and the turbulent fluxes are assumed to be linearly related to height, with a jump at the top. In the local scheme, the turbulent flux is scaled by the local gradient of the quantity. In non-local scheme, the turbulence fluxes are related to known quantities at any number of grid points elsewhere in the vertical. In top-down and bottom-up diffusion, the vertical profile is determined by diffusion from the two directions and the turbulent fluxes in sub-grid scale are derived from known quantities or their vertical derivatives at the same grid point. =Full mixing scheme= Full mixing is the simplest representation of CBL in some global models. Fluxes within this layer are assumed to decrease linearly with height, and the mean variables keep their vertical profile at each simulation time step. All mean variables are uniformly distributed throughout the whole CBL and have a jump at the top of CBL. This simple model has been used in meteorology for a long time, and continues to be a popular approach in some global course resolution models. =Local closure= The local closure K-theory is a simple and effective scheme for shear dominated turbulent transport in the surface layer. K-theory assumes that mixing for heat, water vapor and pollutant concentration occurs only between adjacent layers of the CBL, and that the magnitude of mixing is determined by the eddy diffusion coefficient K_c and local gradients of corresponding scalars \\\\frac{\\\\partial c}{\\\\partial z}. \\\\overline{w'c'} = - K_c \\\\frac{\\\\partial c}{\\\\partial z} Where K_c is an \\"eddy diffusion coefficient\\" for c, which is typically taken as a function of a length scale l_c and local vertical gradients of c. For neutral condition, K_c is parameterized using Mixing-Length Theory. K_c = l_c^2 \\\\left \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{u}}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right \\\\vert If a turbulent eddy moves a parcel of air upward by amount z during which there is no mixing nor other changes in the value of c within the parcel, then we define l_c by l_c = \\\\kappa z where \\\\kappa is the von Karman constant empirically derived (0.35 or 0.4). Mixing-length theory has its own limitation. The theory only applies to statically neutral condition. It biases for statically stable and unstable conditions. Mixing-length theory fails when the wind speed is uniformly distributed, people use knowledge of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) to improve parameterization of eddy diffusion coefficient K_c to account for large eddy transport in typical CBL. TKE gives us a measure of the intensity and effectiveness of turbulence and it could be measured accurately. K_c=Sl_ce^{\\\\text{1/2}} where S is the dimensionless stability function, and e is the TKE. The diagnostic equations used to obtain parameters S and l_c differ in different TKE closures. =Non-local closure= In buoyancy dominated regions, K-theory fails since it always yield unrealistic zero flux in a uniform environment. The non-local characteristics of large buoyancy eddies are accounted for by adding a non-local correction to the local scheme. The flux of any scalar c can be described with \\\\overline{w'c'} = - K_c ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial c}{\\\\partial z} - \\\\gamma_c ) where \\\\gamma_c is a correction to the local gradient to represent the counter gradient flux transport of large-scale eddies. This term is small in stable conditions, and is therefore neglected in such conditions. In unstable conditions, however, most transport is done by turbulent eddies with sizes on the order of the depth of the boundary layer. In such cases, \\\\gamma_c = b \\\\frac{\\\\overline{(w'c')_s}}{w_s} where \\\\overline{(w'c')_s} is the corresponding surface flux for a scalar c, and b is a coefficient of proportionality. w_s is the mixed layer velocity scale defined from surface friction velocity and wind profile function at the surface layer top. The eddy diffusivity for momentum is defined as K_c=\\\\kappa z w_s (1-\\\\frac{z}{h})^2 where \\\\kappa is the von Karman constant, z is the height above the ground, h is the height of the boundary layer. Compared to full mixing scheme, the non-local scheme significantly improves simulations of the vertical distributions for NO2 and O3, as evaluated in a study done in summer using aircraft measurements. It also reduces model biases at surface over the U.S. by 2-5 ppb for peak O3 (O3 concentration is 40-60ppb) in the afternoon, as evaluated using ground observations. =Top-down and Bottom-up diffusion= The entrainment fluxes of quantities are not treated in the non-local scheme. In the top-down and bottom-up scheme, both the surface fluxes and the entrainment fluxes are represented. The mean scalar fluxes are the sum of the two fluxes \\\\overline {w'c'}=\\\\overline{(w'c')_s} (1-z/h_1)+\\\\overline{(w'c')_l} (z/h_1) Where h_1 is the height of mixed layer. \\\\overline{(w'c')_l} and \\\\overline{(w'c')_s} are the scalar flux at the top and bottom of CBL and scale as Modeled vertical profile and turbulent flux of virtual potential temperature.

Location  The hill castle stands on the Schlossberg hill at an elevation of 458 metres and houses a castle information centre for the Palatinate and North Vosges regions and a castle caf√© owned by the Palatine Forest Club. Its exposed location means there are extensive views over Lemberg and the surrounding wooded hills of the Wasgau region.  History  In 1198 the abbot of Hornbach Abbey granted two hills, the Gutinberc and the Ruprehtisberc, to Count Henry I of Zweibr√ºcken. On these hills the count built the castles of Lemberg and Ruppertstein.Ruppertstein Castle The construction period was probably around 1200, but the first documented record of the Castrum Lewenberc dates to 1230. Today, all that survives on the Schlossberg hill are some wall remains and the foundation of a chapel. The chapel was mentioned in 1502, but coins and shards of pottery found on the site indicate that it goes back to the second half of the 13th century. The first known castellan (Burgmann) was Gozo of Lemberg, who is recorded in 1269.Burgenwelt.de: Historie der Burg Lemberg In 1333 the castle went to Count Simon I, son of Eberhardt of Zweibr√ºcken-Bitsch. From 1535 to 1541, his successor, Count James of Zweibr√ºcken-Bitsch resided at the castle and remodeled it into a Renaissance schloss. Following his death in 1570 an inheritance dispute arose, which the Lehnsherr of the castle, Duke Charles of Lorraine ended by occupying the castle with his own troops in 1572. In 1606 he agreed with Count John Reinhard I of Hanau-Lichtenberg, that James' grandson would receive the Lemberg estate, whilst Charles II would hold the lordship of Bitche. The castle and village were occupied and plundered in 1634 and 1635 during the Thirty Years' War. In 1636 the castle was razed and then only rebuilt in makeshift fashion. In 1688 Louis XIV of France sparked the War of the Palatine Succession. He acted on the authority of his sister-in-law, Liselotte of the Palatinate. The background was his plans for expansion, which were opposed by an alliance of the German emperor, the imperial princes, Spain and England. In view of their superiority, Louis XIV, ordered that the Palatinate was to be burned. French troops probably slighted the castle in October 1689; even the bergfried was demolished. From then on, the location no longer held any military significance. The wall remains continued to decay, usable stone was carried off and employed for other purposes, for example, the rebuilding of a village church in 1746. Since the 20th century, the castle ruins have gained in importance as a tourist attraction. In 1953, the Lemberg branch of the Palatine Forest Club renovated the castle and established a caf√©; and since 2001 a modern extension has been built to act as a castle information centre and centre for medieval events.  Layout  One feature of Lemberg Castle is its shaft cistern, also, but not quite correctly, called the well shaft. After digging down 94.80 metres the well diggers had still not struck the ground water. So the shaft was turned into a cistern and almost horizontal adit driven to the shaft. After almost 200 metres the adit meets the shaft at a depth of about 60 metres. A spring on the hillside filled the shaft via the adit thus providing the required water supply. All the work was carried out with hammers and chisels. It is also remarkable that the tunnel ever intercepted the shaft. The well proved to be a valuable archaeological site during several excavation projects in the 1990s, especially for the period of the destruction of the castle in the 17th century.

The Vlaamsche Hoogeschool (Dutch; \\"Flemish Academy\\"), commonly known as the von Bissing University (), was a Dutch-speaking university established at Ghent in German-occupied Belgium in October 1916. The university, which was separate from the existing Ghent University, formed part of the German Flamenpolitik and was a response to the long-established grievance of the Flemish Movement which campaigned against Ghent University's curriculum being taught only in French, despite the university being located in a majority Dutch-speaking region. The institution took its informal name from Moritz von Bissing, the German Governor-General of Belgium from 1914 to 1917, who was one of the chief proponents of the Flamenpolitik. Background Before the outbreak of World War I higher education in Belgium was run in French, despite the presence of a majority Dutch-speaking population. French had historically been privileged as the language of the government, civil service and the bourgeois across the country. In the late 19th century, however, the emerging Flemish Movement (Vlaamse Beweging) increasingly challenged the use of French in majority Dutch-speaking Flanders. In the years before the World War I, the movement had achieved de jure legal equality for Dutch as an official national language, but the issue was still contentious at the outbreak of war in August 1914. In particular, the language used in higher education was still being highlighted by the Flemish Movement, as French remained the only language of instruction in all Belgian universities. At the outbreak of war, it appeared that Ghent University, located in the Flemish city of Ghent, would be forced by law to begin teaching in Dutch by 1915, but the outbreak of war and German invasion of Belgium stopped any realization of this objective. In German-occupied Belgium, Governor-general Moritz von Bissing sought to make the territory easier to govern by exploiting pre-war linguistic divisions. The Flamenpolitik (\\"Flemish policy\\") was launched in 1916 and was also influenced by Pan-German beliefs. In particular, since the issue of Ghent University was already contentious, the German administration hoped to legitimize itself and at the same time to discredit the Belgian state. University A certificate of inscription from Von Bissing University The university was inaugurated on 3 October 1916 with Peter Hoffmann as rector, with around 40 academics. The German mathematician, Walther von Dyck, was put in charge of the project. Von Dyck strongly believed that the university would defend Germany's strategic and military interests, describing it as \\"a mighty fortress, a trusty shield and a weapon for us Germans.\\" The university opened its doors on 24 October 1916. It faced opposition from current students at Ghent University, and also was condemned by a petition signed by 38 leading Flemish public figures including Louis Franck delivered before its opening. Among the academics was the lawyer Lodewijk Dosfel and the activist Hippoliet Meert. Among the original students was the Flemish Movement activist Wies Moens. It was considerably smaller than the University of Ghent, which had more than 1,200 students in each year before the war. By contrast, Von Bissing university never had more than 400 students in each year at its height. Reception and legacy The university itself is considered by historians to have failed to achieve its aims. It failed to gain wide support from across Flemish Movement, particularly since some of the early supporters, including the historian Paul Fredericq who had campaigned for Dutch language instruction, had been imprisoned. It was equally resented by many French-speaking academics. This, however, did not stop the continuation of the Flamenpolitik by the German administration, which led to the creation of the Raad Van Vlaanderen (\\"Council of Flanders\\" or RVV; a quasi-independent Flemish government) in February 1917. Although the Flemish Movement had campaigned for the \\"Flemishization\\" (flamandisation) of Ghent University, many within the movement were divided about whether accepting the university would be collaboration and some students passively resisted it. The establishment of the university created a rupture within the Flemish Movement between the \\"Activists\\" (activisten) who supported the German initiatives and the \\"Passivists\\" (passivisten) who opposed any form of collaboration with the Germans. After the end of the war, in 1930, Ghent University became Dutch speaking following continued agitation by the Flemish Movement. Von Bissing University featured in the Belgian 2014 miniseries In Vlaamse Velden (\\"In Flanders' Fields\\") produced by VRT. In it, one of the protagonists, Philippe Boesman (played by Wim Opbrouck), tries and fails to get tenure at the university as an academic gynaecologist.

These works may be made of wood, stone, ceramic material, plastic, bronze, copper, or any other number of materials and may or may not be painted. When applied to cultural heritage this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer. Artist Brose Partington applies wax using a torch to a bronze sculpture. Environmental issues Unlike many works of cultural heritage, outdoor artworks are not exhibited in a controlled environment, where temperature and relative humidity are closely monitored. Though works may be more easily preserved in a controlled environment, they are installed outside to preserve the artist's intent, and avoid decontextualization.Chiantore, Oscar, and A. Rava. (2005). Conserving Contemporary Art: Issues, Methods, Materials, and Research. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. Instead, outdoor works are exposed to many and various environmental factors depending upon its geographic or site location and its configuration.Naudƒó, Virginia N. (1985). Sculptural Monuments in an Outdoor Environment. Philadelphia, PA: Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Environmental threats may include, but are not limited to rain, snow, acid rain, and earthquakes as well as fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity. They may also be exposed to excessive amounts of light as well as human intervention. Excessive rain and moisture can also lead to mold growth. Daily exposure to ultraviolet, visible, and infrared (IR) radiation has a detrimental effect on painted sculptures or those with organic or inorganic coatings. Excessive light exposure may cause color alterations and loss as well as structural breakdowns in the paint and coatings.Considine, Brian B. (2010). Conserving Outdoor Sculpture: The Stark Collection at the Getty Center. Los Angeles, CA: The Getty Conservation Institute. Air pollution can also adversely affect outdoor artworks. In addition to meteorological conditions, traditional outdoor pollutants including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and ozone affect the various composite materials.Grzywacz, Cecily M. (2006). Monitoring for Gaseous Pollutants in Museum Environments. Tools for Conservation. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Conservation Institute. The specific level and type of air pollution degradation is dependent on the material and composition of the artwork as well as the length of exposure. Organic carbonyl pollutants are also an increasing threat due increased use of ethanol based fuels. Contemporary conservation methods Though specific conservation methods are dependent on the material, condition, and environment for each artwork, there are some standard practices for outdoor works. These include condition assessment, treatment, preventive conservation, and maintenance. =Assessment of condition= Before any conservation treatment, a thorough condition assessment with written and photographic documentation is completed. This initial assessment may include research into the artist's working techniques or a discussion with the living artist, review of the conservation history of the object, and non-destructive analysis. According to Virginia Naud√© and Glenn Wharton, there are four steps that come with the assessment or survey of an outdoor sculpture:Naud√©, Virginia N. (1993). Guide to the Maintenance of Outdoor Sculpture. Washington, D.C.: American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works # Technical descriptions and condition assessments of each sculpture: Identification and exploration of materials, fabrication, past maintenance practices, surface condition, and structural integrity. This also includes an assessment of previous repairs, treatment and/or maintenance. # Maintenance recommendations for each sculpture: Recommendations based on the history, condition, and location of the sculpture, the resources of the owner, and the relative needs of the sculpture in the context of the whole collection. The maintenance recommendation should include information on routine care and periodic treatment. # Assignment of priorities to recommended activities: Conservator- assigned priorities based on the previously attained technical information. These priorities will later be assessed by stakeholders in relation to art historical, fund-raising, and other priorities. # Estimate of resources required: Includes labor costs of the various maintenance options proposed for conservators, technicians, and other specialists. An estimate of hours is particularly useful if the recommended work will not take place immediately. Supplies and equipment costs are also included. =Treatment of outdoor artworks= The treatment of outdoor artworks is multifaceted and dependent on the material type, condition, structural integrity, and exhibition conditions. A brief overview of conservation treatments by material is outlined below, and more thorough discussions are available on the individual conservation pages. * Bronze sculptures: For many bronze sculptures and other metal sculptures, treatment includes a reduction buildup from previous protective coatings, removal of corrosion and incrustation, or cleaning. This may be done by hand, water blasting, air abrasion, or other methods. Then, a wax or wax composite is applied to the sculpture in sweeping motions. Finally, the wax is buffed with a cotton cloth.Kipper, Patrick V. (1996). The Care of Bronze Sculpture: Recommended Maintenance Programs for the Collector. Loveland, CO: Path Publications. . *Ceramic sculptures: Ceramic sculptures are much less common than bronze sculptures, and require a different conservation and maintenance procedures. Mechanical and chemical cleaning methods may be used, and previous conservation treatments and adhesives may be removed. Next, consolidation of fragments and flaking glaze may be completed. For sculptures comprised with multiple ceramic parts joined with mortar, the grout may also require conservation intervention. *Plastic sculptures: Plastic elements are prevalent in contemporary sculptures. Outdoor sculptures may be made entire or in part of polyester, epoxy, phenol, or acrylic materials. Unfortunately, treatment for plastic sculptures may be limited as some changes from degradation in plastics are not reversible. *Painted sculptures: As Brian Consodine writes, painted sculptures are actually a multi-layered composition that can contain primers, paints, and protective coatings as well as the structural substrate. Problems that may occur with painted sculptures include degradation or alteration of color, cracking and flaking of paint, and failure of the primer layer which exposes the underlying primary support to the elements. Treatments for painted sculptures may include reduction of previous coatings and repairs, cleaning, consolidation, and inpainting of losses. =Preventive conservation= Wax and a brush used to maintain a bronze sculpture. Preventive conservation involves actions taken to delay deterioration of cultural heritage. For outdoor artworks, this usually involves the application of a protective coating and regular maintenance. The particular protective coating is chosen based on its durability, adhesion to the surface, ease of maintenance, and surface appearance on the work. The coating provides some protection from environmental factors, but must be occasionally be reduced and reapplied for best results. A long-term conservation schedule should be created and implemented to ensure the longevity of the artwork. A maintenance walk-through schedule should also be established to routinely check the condition of the objects. This may be a weekly procedure; it is useful as conservators can assess and document any damage caused by visitors or environmental conditions, and may rinse and wipe down sculptures.

In 1985 SFH was incorporated as a Nigerian non-governmental organisation and in 1994 released the award-winning \\"Who Get This Rain Coat\\" Gold Circle Condom/Family Planning campaign on national television. In the late 1980s it went into partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to distribute Gold Circle condoms in Lagos, Oyo and Ogun States, in South Western Nigeria. It soon scaled up its operations, expanding nationwide, and commencing the marketing of oral contraceptives, in partnership with USAID.

Reception =Academic research= A 2001 paper by Roy Batchelor of City University Business School, London compared the Consensus Forecasts with forecasts made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The study found: \\"With few exceptions, the private sector forecasts are less biased and more accurate in terms of mean absolute error and root mean square error. Formal tests show these differences are statistically significant for forecasts of real growth and production, less so for forecasts of inflation and unemployment. Overall, there appears little information in the OECD and IMF forecasts that could be used to reduce significantly the error in the private sector forecasts.\\" The accuracy and bias in the combined forecasts has been a topic of academic research. A 2009 paper by Ager, Kappler and Osterloh found: \\"The test for common bias reveals that several countries show biased forecasts, especially with forecasts covering more than 12 months. These results partially confirm the presumption that the macroeconomic forecasts for the past 10 years were severely affected by the pronounced shocks in that period. The fact that for individual countries systematic biases can be observed by applying the Consensus Forecasts reveals that in these countries the forecasting industry on the whole was not able to cope with the shocks specific to the past ten years. Revisions of past months for GDP growth forecasts have significant explanatory power for current revisions for almost all countries. For inflation revisions we find significant past revisions for some countries. Overall, our results imply that a lack of information efficiency is more severe for GDP forecasts than for inflation forecasts.\\" A 2011 paper by Filip Novotny and Marie Rakova for the Czech National Bank compared the accuracy of the Consensus Forecasts estimates with those of the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Echoing the result of Ager, Kappler, and Osterloh, it found: \\"In the period from 1994 to 2009 Consensus forecasts for effective euro-area consumer price inflation and GDP growth beat the alternatives by a difference which is typically statistically significant. The results are more diverse for the pre-crisis sample (1994‚Äì2007). The Consensus forecast for euro-area producer price inflation significantly outperforms the na√Øve forecast in the short-term. Finally, the Consensus forecast for the USD/EUR exchange rate during the period from 2002 to 2009 is more precise than the na√Øve forecast and the forecast implied by the forward rate.\\" A 2007 paper by Batchelor used Consensus Forecasts data to consider various theories of bias in macroeconomic forecasts, and concluded: \\"In all countries there is evidence that individual forecasters converge on the consensus forecast too slowly. However, the persistent optimism of some forecasters, and the persistent pessimism of others, is not consistent with the predictions of models of ‚Äúrational bias‚Äù that have become popular in the finance and economics literature.\\" Consensus Forecasts data has been cited by other academic literature, such as discussion of the Asian financial crisis.

The storyline details the subsequent reaction of local residents and the transformation Hong Kong undergoes leading up to the date of destruction.  Censorship  The film is an allusion to the changes that have taken place in the city since the 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China; the 2047 meteor a metaphor for the real-world expiry of the autonomy afforded to Hong Kong within the One country, two systems arrangement, and the uncertainty that follows.

Included is information on tornadoes, high wind events, hail, lightning, floods and flash floods, tropical cyclones (hurricanes), ice storms, snow, extreme temperatures such as heat waves and cold waves, droughts, and wildfires. Photographs of weather and attendant damage are used as much as possible. Maps of significant weather are also included.  Background  Storm Data was started by the Weather Bureau, predecessor to the National Weather Service (NWS), in 1959. It is updated continuously on a monthly basis with a lag of a few months from the present. This delay is because the data is compiled and verified by local NWS offices and sent to the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) which does further refinements and publishes Storm Data in reports covering the entire country. The local NWS offices initially gather the data, starting when a severe weather event unfolds and continuing until sufficient information is obtained. The initial data, considered preliminary, is sent in real-time to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) which does limited quality control as new information becomes available and enters it into its (and its predecessor the National Severe Storms Forecast Center) Storm Events Database that begins in 1950. Original sources of the data include but are not limited to local law enforcement, local, state, and federal emergency management, storm spotter and storm chaser reports, the news media, insurance industry data, NWS damage surveys, and reports from the general public. SPC is interested in tornado, convective wind, and hail data. The tornado portion of the database, the National Tornado Database, is one of three authoritative tornado databases. Another is the DAPPL (short for Damage Area Per Path Length) database that was headed by Ted Fujita at the University of Chicago and concerns the period from 1916-1992. The most comprehensive historical database was compiled by Tom Grazulis of the Tornado Project and exhaustively covers known significant tornadoes for the period from 1680-1995. Both the Storms Event Database and Storm Data are official records. The database and the publication are from the same source but the database is more easily searchable. Delayed reports are added to both the database as well as the publication as new information becomes available in the \\"Late Reports and Corrections\\" section. Until 2012 Storm Data was available to anyone but for a charge. Now it is a free publication downloadable from the NCEI website.  Format  Storm Data publishes chronological tabulations, narratives, and images for a calendar month, as well as updates to previous publications. The format has undergone various changes throughout publication history but consists of reports separated by state subdivided by regions within a state. Type of occurrence, location (including municipality and county as well as estimated latitude and longitude), date and time, magnitude of event (i.e. wind speed, Fujita scale rating, Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale rating, hail size, storm surge or river crest height, etc.), fatalities and injuries, monetary damages of property and agricultural crops, and descriptions are included. For tornadoes, Fujita scale or Enhanced Fujita scale rating is included as well as path length in miles and path width in yards. Average path width is listed from 1950-1994 and maximum path width is listed from 1995 to present. For fatalities, demographic information such as age and sex are gathered when possible as is the type of location (frame house, mobile home, apartment, outside, vehicle, church, school or other public building, etc.) and/or activity (boating, camping, playing sports, golfing, swimming, bathing, telephoning, construction work, etc.) at time of death.Storm Data Reference Notes Significant waterspouts, funnel cloud sightings, dense fog, dense smoke, dust storms, dust devils, debris flows (such as landslides), avalanches, tsunami and other surf and tide events, volcanic ash, as well as other extreme or unusual weather may also be listed.

Formed in Los Angeles, the band consisted of Shele Pinizzotto (guitar), Rosemary Butler (bass), Sherry Hagler (keyboards), and Olivia \\"Liver\\" Favela (drums). Each of the band members contributed lead vocals and harmonies. Biography Pinizzotto, Butler, and Hagler grew up in Los Angeles and Orange County and played together in bands during their high school years. Both Pinizzotto and Butler were in the Fullerton girl band named The Ladybirds. Afterwards, they formed the group Birtha. They were joined by Favela in 1968, at which time the group began playing clubs along the West Coast from California to Alaska. Over the next three years, Birtha worked on improving their craft and by 1971 they started to write their own material. Most of the band's songs were composed by members of the group, but there were occasional outside songwriting contributions, from Mark Wickman and Gabriel Mekler. The band was managed by Pinizzotto's brother, Michael. Birtha signed a record deal with Dunhill Records in 1972 and released their debut self-titled album, produced by Mekler, later that year. After the album's release, Birtha toured the U.S., Canada, and Europe. The group achieved some notoriety when, during a UK tour with The Kinks, publicity flyers for the shows stated, \\"Birtha has balls\\". When Birtha made return visits to Los Angeles, they would often play Whisky a Go Go and The Troubadour, as well as a club in Glendale called The Sopwith Camel. In 1973, Birtha released their second album, Can't Stop the Madness, produced by Christopher Huston. The band continued touring and was on the road for more than 250 days a year, performing with such acts as Fleetwood Mac, Alice Cooper, Poco, Black Oak Arkansas, Cheech & Chong, B.B. King, Three Dog Night, James Gang, and more. The band broke up in 1975.

The game features puzzle and RPG elements, and revolves around a boy named Hiroshi, who is trapped with his friends in a haunted mansion, and is stalked by a monster. Plot The player assumes the role of 'Hiroshi', a young teenager who enters a haunted mansion with his friends, Takuro, Takeshi, and Mika (Along with Kazuya and Ryota in the original). Shortly after entering the mansion, the doors lock behind them. Hiroshi doubts that the mansion is haunted, but soon finds himself being pursued by an enigmatic blue Oni. Hiroshi must now find a way to save as many of his friends as possible and escape the mansion alive. =The Oni= Very little information is explained in the game about the Oni and his reasons for inhabiting the mansion, but it is assumed that he may have been one of the mansion's old residents. The Oni is a muscular, tall humanoid with a large head and blue skin who is roughly twice the size of an average human. When he appears in the game, a characteristic \\"shrieking\\" string chord plays until the player outruns him. Normally, his mouth is kept closed in an amused smirk, but in a secret ending he is shown to have a set of sharp, knifelike teeth. If the Oni captures and kills one of Hiroshi's friends, they too turn into an Oni, distinguishable by their hairstyles, which they kept when transformed by the Oni. In addition to the standard Oni, the player can enter an \\"Oni Room\\" containing numerous deformed, mutated and completely original Onis, including a rectangular oni called \\"Blockman\\", who resembles the popular Japanese character Domo-kun, and a gigantic, muscle-bound Oni who humorously appears to be hefting invisible weights when encountered for the first time. Both of these Onis can chase the player more than once if the player enters their names when creating a new game. In general, the Oni will chase the player at random after he has first been seen, but several of the chases are necessary to advance the storyline. Gameplay During the game, the player explores various rooms of the mansion, gathering items and solving puzzles to help them progress. At seemingly random points, the Oni will appear in the room, with the shrieking string chord accompanying them, forcing the player to evade the Oni, either by outrunning or hiding from them. Most of these chases can be avoided by carrying out tasks correctly or in the right order, but there are several chases which must be carried out to advance the game's story. Media =Novels=  Novelizations  In 2013, a series of novels were released which were based on the game. Slight differences to the storyline, mostly based on characterisation are present, but the books are otherwise faithful to the game's plot. The title was licensed for digital distribution in the English language by J-Novel Club. The series is made up of five novels, which J-Novel Club released between 2018 and 2019: Ao Oni, Ao Oni: Vengeance, Ao Oni: Mutation, Ao Oni: Grudge, and Ao Oni: Forever.  Junior novels  In 2018 PHP Laboratory began publishing a series of junior novels based on the Ao Oni series. The series follows the game characters, who are of elementary school age instead of teenagers, and is told from the perspective of a stray dog that was taken in by Takuro's uncle. # „ÄéÈùíÈ¨º „Ç∏„Çß„Ç§„É´„Éè„Ç¶„Çπ„ÅÆÊÄ™Áâ©„Äè(2018, lit.

Reception The independently developed freeware game gained a cult status online in Japan, gaining notoriety on websites such as Niconico and YouTube where Ao Oni-related videos exceeded 50 million views in 2013. The popularity of the game revolves around the effectiveness of its horror aspects despite being a simple game, with the background music often being cited as a key contributor to the chilling atmosphere used to incite fear.

She had an acknowledged influence over the affairs of state through her personal influence over the sultan. Some Europeans are even said to have called her the \\"Empress of Morocco\\" as a result. Life Zaydana was purchased to become a member of the harem as a slave concubine from Moulay ar-Rashid for sixty ducats. In accordance with Islamic law, the sultan was allowed to have a harem of slave concubines in addition to his four wives, as long as the concubines were slaves. However, despite the fact that the sultans normally only married women from prominent families such as the sharif families, Ismail formally married Zaydana, who managed to achieve a great emotional bond with him and thereby gain influence over the entire kingdom. The French Dominican friar Dominique Busnot described her as an enormous, tall and fat black woman who somehow managed to acquire such influence over the sultan that she could often deal with him as she wished. To explain her influence, many Moroccans called her a witch. Zaydana staged intrigues and plots to have her own son Moulay Zaydan (1672‚Äì1708) named successor before Moulay Muhammad al-Alim, who was the son of a European concubine that was previously known as Mrs. Shaw. She claimed that he was preparing a coup to conquer the throne. While this was not initially true, he was in 1704 provoked to actually do so, after which he was captured in July of that year. He committed suicide in 1706 after his father had one of his hands and one of his feet amputated as punishment. Zaydana then had her own son replace him as governor. However, in October 1708, her son was murdered by his concubines at Taroudant. Zaydan was said to be a drunk. It has been suggested that the two women accused of the killing were actually following the orders of the sultan, who did not dare to tell Zaydana, who subsequently had the two women executed. Zaydan was buried in the Moulay Muhammad al-Alam Mausoleum at Meknes. Zaydana died in 1716. Some Europeans are said to have called her the \\"Empress of Morocco\\", although the first royal consort to bear an official title in Morocco is Lalla Salma. Another report made by a Spaniard called Joseph de Leon alleged that Ismail Ibn Sharif was strangled by his \\"concubine\\" Zaydana. This is clearly libelous however, as Ismail Ibn Sharif lived for over a decade after Zaydana died.

During this period, people from Central Asia frequently traded with people who lived in the Tang capital Chang'an through the Silk Road. As a result, there are large amounts of preserved material cultures that are seen as evidence of interactions between these areas, such as wall paintings, sculptures, print and textiles. These remains can reflect to what extent the frequency of the interactions were. One of the most spectacular material cultures here is the Tang dynasty. The Tang dynasty can be regarded as a milestone of drastic cultural transformation in Dunhuang since it began in 619. Before the Tang Dynasty, the arts in Dunhuang can be divided into two main trends: northwest tribes and central plains (China). Both these art works existed separately and were presented for different groups of people. Due to territory expansion in the Tang dynasty, China was more powerful than before and became influential in other countries. In 642, the completion of cave 220 that commissioned by the Cui family can be regarded as the first influence of Tang art in Dunhuang.Whitefield, Whitefield and Agnew 2000 Until Dunhuang was conquered by Tibet in 781, the effect of the Tang dynasty in Dunhuang murals was significant and that was typically seen as a landmark for establishing the main trend in Chinese art styles in different aspects.Wu 2000  Artistic trend in the Tang  During the Tang Dynasty, the material cultures were presented in distinct ways. From the holistic point of view, due to a brand new trend of arts, the poets, art historians and connoisseurs made an effort to portray observable phenomena of human behaviours, such as emotions, movements, motivations and traditional customs.Dunhuang Research Institute 2000 They often took preparatory sketches in order to organise the positions of different figures and objects. They also used more colors to make the paintings colourful and magnificent.Whitefield, Whitefield and Agnew 2000 Through these tiny details, the artists showed their great skills at capturing complex emotions in facial expressions and body gestures. There is a story about a famous artist called Wu Daozi that can be seen as an example to explain the main drawing trend in the Tang dynasty. It is said that Wu Daozi had painted some dragons with vivid scales that seemed to be flying into the sky. On days when it was about to rain, the mist would rise surround the drawing.Fraser 2004 In other words, the popular painting style in the Tang dynasty was to conflate illusion and reality to make people approach the core spirit of truth. The material culture in Dunhuang, especially in the aspects of performance, has preserved these auras.  Influence of Buddhism on Tang culture  Some arts in Dunhuang show the rituals that people used as part of Buddhism. In China, people often regarded icons of the Buddha as sacred objects with magical potency. Because of the unknown dangers on the Silk Road, people who needed to pass through would pray to the statues or portraits of the Buddha in order to receive the conferment of a blessing. Due to the high demand of trading along the Silk Road, the worship of Buddhism was thriving in Tang times.Tung 1992 Buddhism originated from India and took root gradually in China through many independent groups of travelling monks and their followers. The earliest evidence for the Buddhist community dates back to AD 65 in what is now Jiangsu and Shandong. In the Han dynasty (BC 202-AD 220), a Buddhist community was flourishing near Luoyang which was the capital of the Han dynasty. During this period, more and more sutras were translated into Chinese. Since AD 220, China was separated by two occupiers which caused a division between north and south. After the reunification of Sui(AD 598-618), Buddhism gradually established the fundamental disciplines. In the Tang dynasty, Buddhism became an important religion for loyal families and people in all walks of life to obey and worship.Whitfield & Farrer 1990 Hence, some Buddhist rituals that were vital on various occasions were recorded by monks and their followers in Dunhuang. For example, the ‚ÄúSketches of mudra‚Äù shows the traditional dancing gestures in mudra. The long roll of paper dates back to the late ninth century and the margins at top and bottom were originally intended to copy the context of the sutra. The ‚ÄúSketches on mudra‚Äù can be divided into a few parts, such as a set of nine standing figures, two seated figures, thirty six pairs of hands and two single hands. According to the repertoire of mudra, researchers suggest that this document may be closely related to the Esoteric school of Buddhism that was introduced into China in the eighth century. The function of this particular scroll was supposed to be a visual aid for teaching and worshipping.Whitfield & Farrer 1990 There are some precious materials that present different types of Buddhist music and dance in Dunhuang. In the early Tang period, the layout of paintings transited into two a two-register format.Dunhuang Research Institute 2000 Take a silk drawing ‚ÄúParadise of Sakyamuni, with illustrations of episodes from the Baoen sutra‚Äù for example. This painting was also discovered at cave 17 which can date back to early the ninth century AD. It depicts the paradise of Buddha Sakyamuni and the story of Prince Sujati. In the upper register, there is a preaching Buddha and an illustration of the sutra. Besides this, there is one dancer in the middle of twelve musicians with different instruments. The lower register contains two groups of donors. The women with simple headdresses stood on the left while the men on the right wore close-fitting caps that can be seen as typical dresses in the tenth century.Whitfield 2004 Cave 220 ‚ÄúHu xuan‚Äù dancer in mural from Mogao .  Tang influence as a reflection of the daily life along the Silk Road  The arts in Dunhuang also show actual lives along the Silk Road and the daily lives of noblemen in the Tang Dynasty. Music and dance were essential parts of Silk Road life which can be seen in various forms, such as the traveling troupes of musicians, the armies with drummers, or the popular songs in the towns,Whitfield 2004 but they also made the patricians‚Äô daily lives more interesting. The main features of the performance arts in Tang Dynasty can be divided into three aspects. Firstly, the dancing style called ‚ÄúHu xuan‚Äù that derived from the western regions was popular. Artists in Dunhuang often used it as decoration in wall paintings. Secondly, playing instruments from the western regions was also popular, especially the ‚Äúpipa‚Äù. People in the Tang dynasty not only played pipa but also danced with it. Lastly, people focused on the gestures from the upper part of the waist rather than the handsTung 1992 Playing the pipa behind the head. = Early Tang performance arts in Dunhuang = Hence, there are numerous material cultures that were closely related to the musicians and dancers in the wall paintings, portable paintings, musical instruments and pottery figures. In the early Tang dynasty, these kind of paintings were often on the below that could present more figures and movements in order to make the whole painting attractive. For example, the wall painting in cave 220 can be seen as a typical example of this trend. Twenty-six musicians and dancers were drawn below the main character. Moreover, two dancers in the painting danced on the circling carpet which often was regard as the most fashionable dancing style (Hu xuan) from the western regions.Tung 1992 = Middle Tang performance arts in Dunhuang = In the middle Tang dynasty, the dancing and singing scenes became vital aspects that can be drawn in the main places. Take wall paintings for example, ‚ÄúPlaying the pipa behind the head‚Äù was discovered in cave 112 of Mogao grottoes. Pipa in the Tang Dynasty was not only an instrument but also an accessory for dancing.Tung 1992 The figure in this wall painting was leaning forward and raising her legs with the pipa playing behind her back. It is a difficult skill in Chinese dancing history that can be seen as a precious material for researchers. In cave 15 and cave 25 in the Yulin grottoes, there are two wall paintings that present enjoyable dancing and music scenes from the middle Tang dynasty. The former one called ‚ÄúVadya devata‚Äù shows a vadya playing a traditional instrument with pretty clothing. Moreover, her clothes seem to be blowing in the wind through analysing the detail of her scarf. The later one is ‚ÄúDancing and music scenes‚Äù. The main character is in the middle, dancing with her drum at the waist. The other figures play various instruments and can be divided into two teams that were separated into the right and left hand sides.Wu 2000 = Late Tang performance arts in Dunhuang = Cave 156, Late Tang Dynasty. The detail of Zhang Yichao army. During the late Tang dynasty, dancing and singing had become essential part of daily lives. As a result, people combined the actual narratives and dancing and singing scenes in the aspects of art. One of the wall paintings in cave 156 of the Mogao grottoes called ‚ÄúZhang Yichan commanding the army to set out‚Äù can be traced back to the late Tang dynasty. Zhang Yichan helped the Tang Empire to reclaim the lost territories and was regarded as a vital commander. However, the official history did not collect sufficient information about him. The wall painting in Dunhuang provides more detail about Zhang Yichan that can compensate for the shortage of official documents. In this painting, there is cavalry with flags that walked in the front. After the cavalry, there is a group of instrumentalists and dancers that can be separated into two lines. The celebration reflected imperial ceremony and aristocratic pursuits in the Tang Dynasty. In the same cave, there was a wall painting called ‚ÄúLady Song, wife of the Dunhuang general Zhang Yichan‚Äù which was drawn on the eastern and northern parts. The main story in this wall painting shows a grand scene of the main character, Zhang Yichan‚Äôs wife, in the ceremonial procession for honoring her husband‚Äôs victory. In the front of the group, there are acrobatic teams with dancers and musicians. There were four women that seemed to lead the main character and all wear Han clothing with various patterns. It presents the desire for military power and social prestige in the late Tang dynasty.Tung 1992  Others  There are some different artefacts can be regarded as evidences of various types of performing, such as ink on paper or pottery figures. ‚ÄúTables of musical notation‚Äù was written in ink on the paper and also excavated in cave 17 in Dunhuang. The first aspect of ‚ÄúTables of musical notation‚Äù contains a few words of popular songs in the Tang dynasty and some Buddhist texts as well. The following notations include ten songs, such as ‚ÄúSongs of the South‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Paired Phoenixes‚Äù. Until now, many researchers have focused on reproducing the music of the Tang dynasty from ‚ÄúTables of musical notation‚Äù. Moreover, there were some pottery figures showing the fashionable clothing trends of the Tang period. ‚ÄúThe female musicians‚Äù shows two women with Kuchean and Chinese fashions. The Kuchean musician plays a pipa originating from Iran which had reached China and become popular, while the Chinese musician plays a drum that derived from India. ‚ÄúThe female dancers‚Äù depicts both Sogdian and Chinese dancers in clothing and appearance. Besides, the gestures of these pottery figures showed the latest trend of Sogdian whirlwind and twirling dancesWhitfield 2004  See also  * International Dunhuang Project * Buddhism in China * Tang dynasty art * Silk Road transmission of Buddhism  Footnotes   References  * Chien, W., 2000.

Biology These anemones feed on planktonic arrow worms of the genus Sagitta. They cannot feed on larger prey items due to their weak nematocysts. No information is recorded as to the lifespan of firework anemones or their larval dispersal. They are considered to have a restricted dispersal potential, and are therefore at risk from habitat degradation. The firework anemone is not asexual, female eggs are released by the stimulation of male gametes.

Its founders, who included Pieter Tack and August Borms, wanted to realize the independence of Flanders from Belgium using German support provided as part of the Flamenpolitik. The Council originally included 46 members, but eventually expanded to include 93. Despite hopes that the Council would be allowed full legislative powers, it never became more than a consultative body. It also suffered from internal factionalism and infighting. Its members were broadly supported by the Germans but were condemned by other flamingants and the Catholic Church. The Germans subsequently made Flanders and Wallonia separate administrative regions in June 1917. However, the appointment of Georg von Hertling as German chancellor in November 1917 who opposed the Flamenpolitik reduced support for the RVV among the German administration. On 22 December 1917, without prior consultation with the occupation authorities, the RVV declared Flanders to be independent and dissolved itself to prepare for elections for a new Flemish government. The German authorities viewed the declaration ambivalently and in January 1918 rejected a draft Flemish constitution presented by the RVV. 50,000 people registered to vote in the coming elections but there were clashes with opponents in Mechelen, Antwerp and Tienen. The Belgian Court of Appeal sent out warrants for the arrest of Tack and Borms as the two leading members of the RVV but the Germans freed them and instead deported the judges responsible. In protest, judges at the Court of Cassation, the country's supreme court, refused to try cases and other judges also went on strike. Faced with mounting opposition, the Germans stopped the planned elections in March 1918. The German surrender in November 1918 led to the end of the Council as King Albert I with the Belgian Army and government regained control. In the aftermath of the war, many of the members of the RVV were arrested and imprisoned as collaborators.

Capitol sued Naxos in the Southern District of New York, which held that because the items were in the public domain in their country of origin (the United Kingdom), they were also in the public domain in the US.Capitol Records, Inc. v. Naxos of America, Inc., 262 F. Supp. 2d 204, 274 F. Supp. 2d 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). On appeal, the Second Circuit held that while federal copyright protection was not available, the state of New York may or may not have common law copyright. The Second Circuit certified the question to the state of New York, which considered several questions, including the question of whether a state's common law copyright protection might survive the expiration of a work's copyright in its country of origin. The New York Court of Appeals held that, because Congress had not preempted common law copyright for pre-1972 sound recordings, that common law copyright was available. Because common law copyright was not bound by federal and international rules regarding expiration into the public domain, Capitol's claim survived. The case was hailed in some quarters, and critiqued in others, but most commentators acknowledged that it was a \\"landmark\\",Brandy Karl, \\"Finding Traditional Contours in the Common Law\\", Tulane Law J. 2008 (draft of article available online) and \\"groundbreaking\\"Joseph I.

On December 20, 2016, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that this common-law right includes only the exclusive right to duplication and publication, and not to public performance. That case, Flo & Eddie v. Sirius XM Radio, ruled that no such common law right to public performance existed in New York. Notes  Further reading  * Timothy P. Best, \\"Capitol Records, Inc. v.

The museum was first located in a 1,375 sq ft. space in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. It opened on 26 April 2014, shortly before the 25th anniversary of the incident. However, the museum received many complaints from the building owners, with regards to breaches of the mutual covenant of the building. The museum closed on 11 July 2016. New premises were found to house the museum in a commercial premises in Mong Kok and the museum reopened on 26 April 2019. Purpose The purpose of the museum is to give residents from mainland China an opportunity to learn more about the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the history of which is censored in China outside Hong Kong. Local residents can also explore the history of democracy and freedom in China. Museum =Temporary museums (2012‚Äì2013)= Before the permanent museum first opened in 2014, there were two temporary museums open for short periods‚Äîthe first in 2012 and then in 2013. The temporary museums were named 4 June Memorial Museum (), hosted by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China. The first temporary museum was located at 269 Yu Chau Street, Sham Shui Po, Hong Kong, and was open between 29 April and 10 June 2012. The second was located at I-Caf√© in the City University of Hong Kong from 12 April through 15 July 2013. =Tsim Sha Tsui location (2014‚Äì2016)= The permanent site was on the fifth floor of the Foo Hoo Centre at 3 Austin Avenue in Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong. The owner of the site is the non-government organization Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China. Costing 9.76 million Hong Kong dollars, the museum was named the 4 June Museum in English, the Chinese name ( being the same as that used for the temporary museums. It opened to the public on 26 April 2014. The museum occupied 800 square feet, and its budget was approximately HK$800,000 per year. A complaint was filed against the museum shortly before it opened by the corporation that owns the building housing it, claiming that the museum violated the building covenants, as it was not using the space as an office and would bring in an excessive number of visitors. A lawsuit over the matter was funded not by the owning corporation but \\"privately\\" by its chairman. In June 2015, the building management began demanding personal information from museum visitors, who reportedly felt \\"harassed\\" by security guards. Albert Ho, chairman of the Alliance, alleged that the fight against the museum was \\"politically motivated\\", and that the museum's detractors appeared to have \\"unlimited resources\\". In light of the above challenges, the museum closed on 11 July 2016. =Temporary museum (2017)= While searching for a permanent location in which to re-establish the museum, a temporary museum was opened in the Jockey Club Creative Arts Centre in Shek Kip Mei, Kowloon on 30 April 2017. It hosted a series of related events surrounding 4 June 2017 and closed down on 15 June. In 2018, the Alliance undertook a search for permanent premises in hopes of re-opening the museum before 4 June 2019. =Mong Kok location (2019‚Äìpresent)= The Alliance purchased premises in Mong Kok in December 2018. About HK$1 million was spent renovating the space to house the museum on a permanent basis. The museum was broken in to and vandalised prior to opening. The Alliance subsequently increased security at the premises. The new museum location opened on 26 April 2019. Exhibits The museum collection consists of artifacts, photographs and information related to the incident. These include the casings of rounds fired by the People's Liberation Army in Tiananmen Square and a raincoat which was worn by a resident of Hong Kong who went to Beijing to support the Democracy Movement. The museum also contains T-shirts signed by the student leaders including Wang Dan and Chai Ling. The museum provided a multi-media area, heritage area, history area and a library. A Goddess of Democracy statue, which at in height symbolizes 4 June, was to have been displayed in the permanent museum. A bottle of home-made liquor billed as \\"Eight Liquor June Four\\" ‚Äì the word \\"liquor\\" () is a homonym of \\"nine\\" () and sold for 89.64 yuan ‚Äì all symbolising for the crackdown date was produced in 2016 by four activists in Sichuan. The bottle's label depicted \\"Tank Man\\" image from 1989, and boasted of being aged 27 years (for the 27th anniversary in 2016) with 64 percent proof. Although the product was seized, one bottle that survived was smuggled out of the country made a symbolic trip around the world, to the Middle East, France, the US and eventually Hong Kong, where it was put on display in the museum. On 4 April 2019, the fourth of four Sichuan men who were arrested in 2016 for producing the liquor was sentenced to jail for 3 years; the three other men were also charged with \\"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\\", but were instead given suspended sentences.

Established in 1912, it is the oldest independently owned rice mill in the United States still in operation. Two of the buildings, dating back to 1914-1917 and 1930, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 10, 1982. with two photos and two maps With .  Origins  Philip Amelius (PA) Conrad (b. 1882, Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana) began rice farming in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana around the turn of the 20th century with his uncle Charles Conrad. Wanting to operate independently, he moved to New Iberia on the banks of the Bayou Teche, buying land on the north side of the Bayou near present-day LA Highway 87, (approximate location of first rice fields) just east of North Lewis Street, to grow rice. The harvested rice was shipped approximately 125 miles by steamboat to New Orleans for milling, as no local rice mills existed. After several crops, in 1910, he built a small rice mill on the property to avoid the need to ship to New Orleans. In 1912 he relocated, rebuilding the mill at its current location at 307 Ann Street in New Iberia and establishing the Conrad Rice Milling and Planting Company. He purchased additional land and moved his rice fields to the south bank of the bayou (now the location of the former Julian Conrad house (Beau Rev√©) at 1312 East Main St. in New Iberia. The location of the rice fields on the Bayou Teche was crucial, since water was required for irrigation of the crops. In subsequent years the company continued to acquire land for farming further to the south, to just beyond the present location of US Highway 90, accumulating a total of 575 acres.  Early farming  Rice farming in the early history of the mill was without any mechanical equipment. The land was tilled and harrowed using mule-drawn implements. After laying seed by hand in the fields, small levees were built with shovels of sufficient height to hold water at a depth of 1 to 1 ¬Ω inches. Water was brought from the Bayou Teche (up to three miles away) using an irrigation system built specifically for that purpose. Water pumps pulled water from the bayou to an elevated trough twelve feet above the bayou that angled down over 700 feet to a street-level flume, using gravity to drive the water to the fields. The flume traversed over a section of the city of New Iberia, being routed under streets using salvaged steam boilers. Two pumps were positioned at the bayou, one operational and one backup, driven by Fairbanks-Morse cold-start crude oil engines, each with two 9\\" pistons, adapted from ice house pumps that drove the refrigeration equipment, and capable of pumping 1100 to 1300 gallons per minute. Initial flooding of the fields took about a week, but water had to be continually pumped to keep the fields under water until the sprouts grew above the ground. At this point, pumping was stopped, and the levees were opened with shovels to drain the water to avoid injury to the young stalks. When the stalks became firm, the fields were again flooded until the rice was almost mature. Rice was planted in the spring (around Easter) and harvested in August. Growing time was about 150 days initially, but newer varieties of rice reduced this time to about 120 days. Irrigation and harvesting by hand required from 20 to 40 workers. Rice on its stalks was cut and assembled by hand into shocks, and allowed to dry in the field for 2 to 3 days. The harvested rice was threshed in the field by a tractor-powered thresher, then transported by wagon to the mill, a distance of up to several miles. At the mill the rice underwent the completion of the drying process by two to three passes in a forced air elevated chimney dryer, to reduce its moisture content from about 25% to 18% to facilitate the milling process.  Mechanical farming  Early tractor of the type used for tilling and plowing Mechanical equipment was introduced beginning in the 1930s. Tractors first replaced mules for tilling and plowing. The first tractors used were McCormick-Deering/International Harvester models with steel wheels and requiring hand cranking for starting. Mechanical harvesting was not introduced until just prior to World War II, when a McCormick Reaper was adapted for use with rice. Rice on its stalks was cut and bundled by the reaper, assembled by hand into shocks for the initial drying in the field. A mechanical thresher replaced the tractor-driven thresher, and the introduction of rice dryers allowed the rice to be dried at the field, reducing the risk of loss to birds and rain. In 1946, mechanical combines were introduced that were capable of both reaping and threshing, removing the rice from the stalk in the field and allowing all of the drying process to take place with rice off the stalk in dryers at the mill.  Milling  The mill built on St. Ann Street in 1912 was three stories high in order to take advantage of gravity in the flow of rice throughout its processing stages. Each of the stages involved processing steps on the rice as it was delivered from the third down to the second and first floors, then up again for the next stage. The first stage began when rice was brought by elevator into a storage bin on the third floor. The bin feed into the \\"stone\\", two 5-foot-diameter stones separated enough to dehull the rice, then into the huller to remove the bran, then the \\"brush\\" for polishing. This stage produced a highly polished rice that was popular during these years, but now has been reduced to only the first step, leaving the bran intact. From the \\"brush\\" the rice was fed into the \\"trumble\\", applying a coating of sucrose (purchased in 55 gallon drums) and talcum powder (hence the instructions \\"wash before cooking\\"). After the \\"trumble\\", the rice was moved to scales for weighing and packaging, originally in 100-pound sacks, and in later years bags of 10, 25 and 50 pounds. Engelberg Huller Company ‚Äì Huller and Separator The hullers were Engelberg hullers manufactured in Germany. Before the use of electric motors, the hullers were driven by Corliss 150 hp steam engines powered from Babcock & Wilcox boilers. An extensive network of belts and pulleys was used to transfer the power from the engines to the hullers. Electric motors were introduced in 1951, replacing the steam engines.  Owners and Employees  PA Conrad's eldest son Philip Odell (PO) Conrad joined his father in the business following high school in 1920, and continued until his death in 1945. PA's second son Allen Conrad started working at the mill in 1925 following completion of boarding school at St. Paul's School (Covington, Louisiana), initially as a farm hand. PA's third son Julian worked as a farm hand during his school years, and joined the business following his graduation from the Soule Business College in New Orleans, assuming the role of bookkeeper. PA Conrad retired in 1940 to open an International Harvester dealership, turning the business over to his three sons, but continued as an informal consultant until his death in 1961. During WWII the business lost all of its full-time labor force. Since there was little mechanization at that time, family members and day laborers were used to keep the operation going. The employee with the longest tenure was Leander \\"Gutchie\\" Viltz (son of Adam Viltz). Leander grew up as a child with Allen and Julian, began working at the mill at the age of six, and worked continuously for 72 years.  Recent history  Farming rice was discontinued in 1968 when a portion of the farm land was sold to develop Caroline subdivision in New Iberia and other housing developments were established near the irrigation system. Milling, however, continued and does so until this day. During its management by the Conrad family, the mill produced only white rice which was sold to local grocery stores. The mill was bought from the Conrad family in 1975 by Michael Davis following the retirement of Allen and Julian Conrad. Davis expanded the varieties of rice produced, including brown and flavored rice. The business also expanded into other food product lines including locally manufactured seasonings, spices, sauces, marinades and snacks, added the brands HOL GRAIN and QUIGGS, and expanded marketing throughout the US and Canada.  Konriko Brand  An attempt to trademark the brand as \\"Conrico\\" (Conrad Rice Company) was made in the 1950s, but was rejected by the US Patent and Trademark Office due to similarity of a trademark by the California Rice Cooperative. A change to the name Konriko was accepted, and remains the brand by which it is known today.

Running Friday through Sunday, the Fest features special guests, live concerts, exhibits, art contests, a Beatles marketplace, a sound-alike contest, a Battle of the Beatles Bands, and more.  History  The Fest for Beatles Fans began in 1974 after founder Mark Lapidos ran the idea by John Lennon during an encounter at the Pierre Hotel in New York City. Lapidos asked Lennon for permission, to which Lennon replied, \\"I‚Äôm all for it! I‚Äôm a Beatles fan too!\\" The first Fest, titled Beatlefest '74, took place over the weekend of 14‚Äì15 September 1974 at the Commodore Hotel in New York City. Over 8,000 Beatles fans attended. The event was supported by BBC TV and Apple Corps in London; both organisations supplied archive films and promotional clips, some of which had never been seen in the US. Each Beatle donated an item to be auctioned off for charity ‚Äì guitars from Lennon and Paul McCartney, a table from George Harrison, and autographed drumsticks from Ringo Starr. Lennon considered attending, but decided not to because he was nervous about the crowd. May Pang, his girlfriend at the time, went in his place, with instructions to buy any interesting-looking memorabilia. Melody Maker journalist Chris Charlesworth helped Pang select items. Beatlefest '74 was recognized on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Since its inception in 1974, the Fest has taken place every year in the New York Metropolitan area. It has taken place in Chicago, Illinois, every year since 1977. The Fest has also taken place in Atlanta, Boston, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Orlando, Philadelphia and San Francisco. Lapidos' 1977 application for a registered trademark on Beatlesfest was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1979 but challenged by Apple Corps in 1997 and ceded by Lapidos in 2002,; Mark Lapidos Productions Ltd. v Apple Corps Limited: * Trademark case * Civil case 00-4947 (DNJ) (HAA) since when the name The Fest for Beatles Fans has been used.

The original building was used as a parochial church for the eastern part of the island of Gozo during the night hours at a time when the only parishes on the island were those of St George and the Collegiate of the Assumption, the present cathedral. Two other chapels were adjoined to the original church, one dedicated to the Holy Cross and the other to St Mark. This is recorded in inquisitor Pietro Dusina's 1575 report. Interior of the church Following the 1551 corsair raid on Gozo led by Sinam Baxa the church suffered extensive damage and had to be rebuilt.

They are mostly found in Europe, west and central Asia and southern Africa.Orthoptera species file (retrieved 3 January 2018) The Saginae are specialist carnivores, which is unusual among the Orthoptera. Their specialist carnivory and appropriately adapted digestive tracts even were regarded as unique in the order Orthoptera, but at least some members of two other subfamilies, the Austrosaginae and Listroscelidinae are partly or completely predatory as well, and until recently those subfamilies were included in the Saginae.

They apply those inner spines in clasping their prey. Some species have spines on the outer surfaces and on the leaping legs as well; those external spines probably are defensive in function. The jaws of Saginae are not spectacular, but are large, powerful, sharp, and businesslike, as befits predators, and the insects do not hesitate to bite when handled. The Saginae are large insects, some species with a body length of more than 50 mm, not counting the antennae or ovipositor, which are long, typically about as long as the body. The ovipositor is long and sword-like, and used for oviposition in soil.

Increasingly involved in the running of the gallery and the management of artists, she published the first of many articles on the painter Walter Sickert in 1932. In the years following World War II, the Beaux Arts Gallery became noted for championing figurative painting. When Frederick died in 1951, Helen took over full directorship of the gallery. Under her leadership, the Beaux Arts Gallery became specifically known for exhibiting artists from the Kitchen Sink School. In particular, four artists from the Kitchen Sink School became known as the Beaux Arts Quartet: John Bratby, Derrick Greaves, Jack Smith and Edward Middleditch. It is especially noteworthy that each of these artists was chosen before they achieved widespread recognition at the 1956 Venice Biennial. Lessore was also key in championing young, unknown artists. For instance, Francis Bacon had a solo exhibition at the Beaux Art Gallery in 1953.\\"Francis Bacon\\" Marlborough Fine Arts, Retrieved 14 April 2014.

In Aiken's downtown area, SC 19 is signed, northbound along Chesterfield Street and Richland Avenue (on state maps, it is officially SC 19 Connector); while SC 19 southbound travels along Laurens Street/Park Avenue onto Chesterfield Street. History SC 19 is an original state highway, established in 1922. Its original routing was from SC 2 in Newberry, north through Whitmire, Union, Spartanburg, Inman and Landrum, to the North Carolina state line continuing as NC 19\\\\. In 1923, it was extended south on new primary routing, through Saluda, to SC 21/SC 27 in Trenton. In 1927, US 176 was assigned to SC 19 from Newberry to the North Carolina state line; the following year it was removed from the overlap. Also in 1928, SC 19 was extended south, replacing part of SC 27 to US 1/US 78 in Aiken. In 1929 or 1930, SC 19 was extended south (again) to SC 28 north of Ellenton. Around 1952, the Savannah River Site was established; which removed of highway in what is now a restricted area. By 1955, SC 19 was widened to four-lanes between the Savannah River Site and Aiken.

Founded in 2001, the company is a worker cooperative enterprise based in Bordeaux, France. History With the success of Dead Cells into 2019, Motion Twin wanted to move onto their next game while still supporting Dead Cells. However, they still wanted to remain a small cooperative of eight to ten persons, so internally, they created a new development team called Evil Empire around January 2019 to take over the development and support of Dead Cells while the other Motion Twin developers started on their next project. Motion Twin is run as an anarcho-syndicalist workers cooperative with equal salary and decision-making power between its members. As part of the legal model, Motion Twin is required to pass a set percentage of its profits to its workers. In August 2019, Motion Twin spun off a new studio, Evil Empire, composed of Dead Cells developers who wanted to continue its development while Motion Twin moved to a new project. Evil Empire is run by Motion Twin's former head of marketing and is not run as a cooperative, particularly because the company wanted to scale beyond ten employees. Motion Twin continues to participate in Dead Cells decisions. Games The company initially gained notice through the release of games such as \\"Hammerfest\\", \\"My Brute\\", \\"Mush\\", \\"Die2Nite\\", \\"Alphabounce\\" and the social game platform, \\"Twinoid\\", and now has a community of 15 million registered users. Since the development of Dead Cells, Motion Twin neglected Twinoid with all its games leading to a strong decline of players. As of yet the future of the platform with all its games is unknown. All games developed by Motion Twin, with the exception of Dead Cells, can be accessed and played for free with some games including a premium option (subscriptions and items) which create revenue for the company.

A. Corey (pen name of Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck) and the fourth book in The Expanse series. It follows the crew of the Rocinante as they join the flood of humanity out into the galaxy, using the gates built by the ancient civilization that also produced the protomolecule. At the release of Cibola Burn, Orbit Books announced that James S. A. Corey would write three additional books in the series (adding to two that were already planned) to bring the series to nine novels and various short stories.\\"Cibola Burn is available now and a big announcement!\\" http://www.orbitbooks.net/2014/06/17/cibola-burn-available-now- big-announcement/ June 17th, 2014 Retrieved March 09 2015 Plot After the events of Abaddon's Gate, humanity has gained access to thousands of new worlds and solar systems through the gate networks. At the start of Cibola Burn the United Nations, Martian, and Outer Planets Alliance governments have thus far restricted exploration and colonization efforts to one corporate scientific survey mission to one of these planets. Complicating matters is the existence of a colonial settlement already existing on the planet from before the military blockade of the rings came into effect. Both sides claim ownership in a confrontation reflecting many colonial interactions throughout history. Jim Holden is sent to mediate the interactions between the colonists and scientists when political and racial tensions culminate in violence. Still dogged by the disembodied presence of Miller, who wishes to investigate the disappearance of the planet's former inhabitants, Holden arrives on a world on the verge of war. Yet the biggest danger to the colonists, scientists, and Holden himself is not the human disagreements that they have brought with them, but the frontier itself. As with the settling of the American West and many colonial projects of Earth's past, the frontier into which humanity has ventured is vast, uncontrolled, and full of dangers. When a mysterious disease and horrific disaster strike at the same time and threaten the lives not only of the colonists, but all those in orbit as well, Holden and Miller must brave the ruins of an alien civilization in search of the one thing that might save them all. Major character arcs Basia Merton is one of the refugees from Ganymede refused safe harbor in the Solar System. His ship pushed through the gate to be the first to settle a new planet. Called Ilus by the inhabitants, they found a rich vein of lithium that could provide a valuable trading commodity with other systems. The United Nations sends a scientific party to the planet with a legal charter to the land. This drives Basia to actions he never thought he would do, and it seems like he has a never-ending set of decisions between bad choices, while he's only trying to do what he thinks is best for his family. Elvi Okoye is a scientist on the team sent by the United Nations. Her original task was to try to survey the planet in a pristine state but events make that impossible. Later, she tries to gain insight into the incredible things happening on the planet that make it seem like the most hospitable biosphere found away from Earth may kill them all. Dmitri Havelock was Miller's partner on Ceres and is now deputy security chief for the UN mission to New Terra. Remaining aboard the ship that brought him while the security chief relocates to the surface, he becomes increasingly concerned about the actions of his supervisor. Later, the fortunate capture of a prisoner from the Rocinante sets a chain of events into motion with long-term repercussions for humanity. James Holden Sensing trouble brewing on Ilus/New Terra, Chrisjen Avasarala sees the need for someone perceived as unbiased to negotiate and report on events there and chooses Jim Holden. After making the journey, the crew tries their best to balance colonial claims, government priority and the awakening creatures on the planet within a crisis greater than all their earlier concerns. Miller is still trying to figure out his role within the alien construct, while maintaining his connection with Holden. Eventual clues come together allowing him to shut down the alien machinery and potentially save everyone. Reception Publishers Weekly gave Cibola Burn a starred review and called it \\"splendid\\".

Born in Berlin to father Alfred Alexander and mother Henny Alexander, he grew up with his twin brother Paul in an assimilated, wealthy household. Alfred was a prominent physician who counted many well-known actors, artists, and scientists, including Albert Einstein, among his friends and patients. In 1936, after being tipped off that he was on a Gestapo arrest list, Alfred remained in London, where he was visiting a daughter, and managed to help the rest of his family emigrate to England via Switzerland. In September 1939, after the outbreak of the Second World War, Alexander volunteered for the British Army, but was refused as an enemy alien. He managed to join the Royal Pioneer Corps as a private in 1940, attended officer training in 1943, and in 1945 was an interpreter at interrogations of guards and staff at the newly liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. \\"Gripped by a righteous anger,\\" and having learned that Rudolf H√∂ss, the former Auschwitz Kommandant, had gone into hiding, Alexander asked his superiors for permission to track down fugitive war crimes suspects, but was denied. He embarked on a search for H√∂ss in his spare time, and when the No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team was formed by the British government in mid-1945 he was asked to join, and became a full- time Nazi hunter. His first major success was tracking down and arresting in December 1945 Gustav Simon, who was, as the Nazi Gauleiter in the Moselland Gau from 1940 until 1944, the Chief of the Civil Administration in Luxembourg, which was occupied at that time by Nazi Germany. In Luxembourg, Simon was responsible for the early and speedy deportation of the Jewish population, and the executions of resistance fighters. Alexander arrested Rudolf H√∂ss on 11 March 1946 in Gottrupel (Germany), where he lived disguised as a gardener and called himself Franz Lang. H√∂ss's wife had given up his address after Alexander threatened to have her teenage son shipped off to Siberia ‚Äî something he would not have been able to do. H√∂ss initially denied his identity \\"insisting he was a lowly gardener, but Alexander saw his wedding ring and ordered H√∂ss to take it off, promising to cut off his finger if he didn't. H√∂ss' name was inscribed inside. The Jewish soldiers accompanying Alexander began to beat H√∂ss with axe handles. After a few moments and a minor internal debate, Alexander pulled them off.\\" After the war, Alexander had a long professional career as a merchant banker at S.G. Warburg.

When applied to cultural heritage, conservation activities are generally undertaken by a conservator. The primary goal of conservation is to preserve the lifespan of the object as well as maintaining its integrity by keeping all additions reversible. Conservation of books and paper involves techniques of bookbinding, restoration, paper chemistry, and other material technologies including preservation and archival techniques. The history of early book conservation has yet to be written. Peter Waters is considered the father of modern book conservation. He developed new techniques of book and paper conservation after the 1966 Florence flood in Italy. The Book and Paper Group (BGP), the largest specialty group within the American Institute for Conservation (AIC), exchanges information and releases an annual journal on book and paper conservation. Book and paper conservation seeks to prevent and, in some cases, reverse damage due to handling, inherent vice, and the environment. Conservators determine proper methods of storage for books and documents including boxes and shelving to prevent further damage and promote long term storage. Carefully chosen methods and techniques of active conservation can both reverse damage and prevent further damage in batches or single-item treatments based on the value of the book or document. Although there are no codified set of rules for book and paper conservation, an unwritten set of ethics govern modern conservation. Conservators seek to select treatments and alterations that are reversible and best maintain the aesthetic and historical integrity of the artifacts. Detailed and proper documentation of treatments applied is another important aspect of book and paper conservation. Definition Conservation of books and paper involves preserving and stabilizing the material as it is while retaining as much of the original materials as possible. Conservation differs from restoration which involves returning a book or manuscript to new condition with the use of more invasive techniques and less preservation of original materials. Preservation is an umbrella term which encompasses conservation and restoration; however, the terms are sometimes used incorrectly when referring to library and archive conservation. The main goal of modern conservation is to maintain the integrity of the original parts of the object and that any additions due to restoration must be reversible. There are two approaches of conservation: active or interventive conservation and passive or preventive conservation.; Active conservation involves evaluating the condition of an object and treating to prevent further decay by cleaning, repairing, and restoring when necessary. In preventative conservation, the science of storage and display are employed in order to control and stabilize the environmental conditions affecting the object in order to prolong its life span. Conservation incorporates the fields of bookbinding, restoration, paper chemistry, and other material technologies including preservation and archival techniques. Because conservation is one example of effort to preserve materials, it can be considered a subcategory of preservation. Conservation often accompanies preservation strategies such as proper storage and display, environmental monitoring, handling training, reformatting and security. However, there are many nuances to conservation and conservators must make decisions about how they will treat the object based on how it will be used or displayed. For example, library conservation requires that the books be legible and usable, but not necessarily aesthetically pleasing. On the other hand, a book or document to be displayed in an exhibit may need to be presented in a more visually appealing condition. Paper-based items, such as books, scrapbooks, manuscripts, letters, journals and diaries, certificates, maps, deeds, newspapers, drawings, miniatures, and postcards present distinctive concerns when it comes to care and conservation. Unlike works of art on paper, these items are often handled directly and repeatedly to access information. Even paper ephemera like newspapers and letters may be significant historical records or family mementos.Library of Congress, \\"Preservation Measures for Newspapers\\", Accessed 13 April 2014, . History The history of early conservation has not yet been written, and early conservators recorded little of their work. Consequently, modern conservators are responsible for recording the previous conservation work they find when evaluating objects.; As early as 750 B.C., Old Testament prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah advised on the importance of the preservation of documents for future use. In 1627, Gabriel Naud√© published Advis pour dresser une biblioth√®the which contained a chapter discussing book preservation. The first substantial work on the subject of book restoration was Alfred Bonnardot's Essai sur l'art de Restaurer les Estampes et les Livres, first published in Paris in 1846. Until the late- nineteenth century, the preferred practice was to restore objects to newer or better condition with little regard to original style or composition. However, modern conservation seeks to treat books and paper as little as possible. Peter Waters, considered the father of modern book conservation, was the conservation coordinator at the National Central Library after the 1966 flood of the Arno in Florence, Italy, and was accompanied by hundreds of conservators from around the world. Before the flood, library conservation was not yet an established field. The water affected one-third of the library collections including periodicals, newspapers, fine prints, maps, posters, and the Magliabechi and Palatine rare-book collections. The flood broke the tradition of maintaining proprietary trade secrets and conservation treatments as the disaster necessitated the collaboration of the world's most experienced book and paper conservators. One book and paper conservation technique that resulted from this collaboration was the development of the \\"heat-set tissue\\" paper mending. Another development from the Florence floods was the study of limp vellum binding and its usefulness in conservation due to its resistance to water damage. Experienced in large scale archival disasters, Waters defined seven essential requirements for successful recovery after the flood. The first publication of a standard of practice for conservators was published in August 1964 in Studies in Conservation by the International Institute for Conservation American Group, now the American Institute for Conservation (AIC). An updated version was released in 1994. Christopher Clarkson originally coined the term \\"book conservation\\" in Florence in 1967 in order to differentiate the early European conservation techniques which sought to preserve only the text of a book. Clarkson argued that \\"foreign marks\\" and \\"foreign matter\\" are important to understand the book's physical history and the social history in which the book resided and that this evidence of use should be preserved. In 1968, the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property organized an international seminar on the subject of conservation of library materials in Rome. In 1969, the first university-level conservation conference occurred at the University of Chicago where they published Deterioration and Preservation of Library Materials. The Book and Paper Group (BGP) is the largest specialty group within the AIC. Through meetings and publications, the BPG exchanges information about the conservation of books and paper. The BPG releases a journal The Book and Paper Group Annual, on the subject of book and paper conservation.  Agents of deterioration  Poor handling is the primary cause of deterioration for books, manuscripts, and ephemera; however, a poor environment can also be a cause of deterioration for books and paper. Conservators must have knowledge of agents that cause decay in order to preserve items. Agents of deterioration can include mishandling, light, fluctuating humidity, dust and pollution, fire, water, gas and heat, neglect, and pests and other vermin. Inherent vice is \\"the quality of a material or an object to self-destruct or to be unusually difficult to maintain\\".National Postal Museum, \\"Inherent Vice,\\" Smithsonian, Accessed on 13 April 2014, . Paper, books, manuscripts, and ephemera are prime examples of materials subject to inherent vice. Early paper was handmade from plant fibers such as flax, hemp, and cotton which are durable and can last for centuries. In the mid-19th century, machine-made paper was introduced, and wood pulp became the most common, least expensive ingredient in paper, especially in newspapers. The presence of lignin in wood pulp paper causes acid to degrade the cellulose, which causes the paper to become brittle and discolored over time.Dava Tobey, \\"Preserving History,\\" Minnesota Historical Society, Accessed on 13 April 2014, . In addition, paper has the natural ability to absorb and retain moisture from the atmosphere, making it prone to the growth of mold, fungi, and bacteria. Furthermore, some inks used in old books and manuscripts are harmful to paper. Iron gall ink, most commonly used from the 8th century through the end of the 19th century, contains acid and can corrode the paper in humid conditions. Insects and vermin are naturally attracted to paper because paper is made of cellulose, starch and protein, materials that provide sources of nourishment. The most common pests are roaches, silverfish, and various types of beetles.Mary C. Baughman, ‚ÄúApproaches to Insect Problems in Paper and Books,‚Äù Harry Ransom Center, Accessed 13 April 2014, . Book lice feed on mold spores found on paper and cardboard, and although they do not cause visible damage, their decomposition and excretions can stain paper and may also nourish other pests, continuing the cycle of damage. Freezing collection items can mitigate pests. However, some materials should not be frozen, such as books made with leather, because the cold temperatures may cause the fat to rise to the surface of the leather resulting in a white or yellow area called a bloom. The use of insecticides directly on collection materials is not generally recommended. However, if the infestation is severe, and fumigation is the best option, the affected items should be separated from the rest of the collection for treatment. Extremes of temperature or relative humidity are damaging from either end of the spectrum (low or high). High heat and low relative humidity can cause paper to become brittle and leather bindings to crack. High temperatures and high relative humidity accelerate mold growth, foxing, staining, blooming, disintegration, and \\"red rot\\" in leather bindings. Fluctuations in temperatures and humidity may also cause cockling: a wrinkling or puckering preventing the surface from laying flat.Cameo, \\"Cockling\\", Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Accessed 22 April 2014, . Air quality must also be taken into consideration. Dust tends to absorb moisture, providing a suitable environment to attract mold growth and insects.State Library of Victoria, \\"Caring for Works on Paper\\", State Library of Victoria, Accessed 13 April 2014, . Dust can also become acidic when combined with skin oils and the surface of paper. All kinds of light (sunlight, artificial light, spotlights) can be harmful. Light can result in fading, darkening, bleaching, and cellulose breakdown. Some inks and other pigments will fade if exposed to light, especially ultraviolet (UV) light present in normal daylight and from fluorescent bulbs. Any exposure to light can cause damage, as the effects are cumulative and cannot be reversed. A paper conservator handling a book.  Storage methods and materials  A paper conservator surveying a collection of materials in storage. In the early 2000s, conservators determined that preservation of materials should no longer be governed by a universal standard but rather rely on a localized approach. Storage in a cool, dry, clean, and stable location can extend the life of an item. Manuscripts and paper documents are often stored in protective archival- quality boxes and folders, made of acid-free and lignin-free materials.Sherelyn Ogden, ‚ÄúStorage Enclosures for Books and Artifacts on Paper,‚Äù Northeast Document Conservation Center, Accessed 22 April 2014, . Documents with heavy use may be stored or encapsulated in a clear polyester (Mylar) film sleeve or folder. As added protection against acid formation, paper-based storage materials may have a buffer, such as calcium carbonate, which can neutralize acids as they form in the storage materials. Boxes should not be overfilled. Items may be interleaved with acid/lignin-free paper. If boxes are only partially full, spacers may be used, or the box may be stored horizontally. Large format material is best stored in a plan cabinet with shallow drawers. The rolling of large items (e.g. maps) should be avoided where possible; but if there is no other option, the item should be rolled around a large diameter archival quality tube. Until recently, baked enamel steel shelving was considered the best option for book storage; however, if not properly baked the enamel coating can give off formaldehyde and other volatile compounds that can harm collections. Unless properly baked, enamel- coated shelves are no longer a widely recommended shelving option. Professional testing can confirm that shelves are properly baked. Powder- coated steel shelving prevents off-gassing problems associated with baked enamel. Chrome-plated steel shelving and anodized aluminum shelving are considered other options for metal shelving, aluminum shelving is considered the optimal choice, particularly for highly sensitive artifacts; however, it is also the most expensive. Wood shelving is a more economical option but the wood must be sealed to prevent the emission of acids and volatiles. The most recommended coating is moisture-borne polyurethane. Paints such as two-part- epoxy, latex, and acrylic can also be used, but they vary in their effectiveness and ease of use. Average-size books should be shelved vertically, side-by-side so they can support each other. Shelves should not be overpacked and should stand away from exterior walls. Oversized or fragile books may be stored horizontally and completely flat, but stacking should be kept to a minimum. Books may be placed in supportive and protective boxes, to prevent soiling and abrasion and to provide structural support. Book boxes may range from simple four-flap enclosures made of archival safe paper or cardboard to custom clamshell or drop-spine boxes covered in book cloth. Active conservation and repair techniques The four stages of conservation include cleaning, stabilization, repair, and restoration. The main objective of cleaning is to achieve clarity of surface detail. Books and documents may be subjected to different types of cleaning. Conservators may clean dust from paper and leather with a soft brush or cloths, a specialized vacuum cleaner, nonchemical vulcanized rubber sponges, or nonabrasive erasing materials such as vinyl erasers. In order to remove mold and insects, conservators use scalpels, aspirators, or specialized vacuum cleaners. Deep freezing is used to kill the insects.NEDCC, \\"Conservation Treatment for Works of Art and Unbound Artifacts on Paper,\\" Northeast Document Conservation Center, Accessed 26 April 2014, Because some adhesive materials are acidic and stain paper, conservators have developed techniques to remove adhesive. Repairs made with water-based adhesives such as animal glue are removed in a water bath, by local application of moisture, or with poultices or steam. Synthetic adhesives and pressure-sensitive (self-adhering) tapes are usually dissolved or softened with an organic solvent before removal. Washing not only removes dirt and aids in stain reduction; it also washes out acidic compounds and other degradation products that have built up in the paper. Washing also relaxes brittle or distorted paper and aids in flattening. When washing alone does not combat acidity, conservators use an alkaline buffer applied by immersion or by spraying. Flattening follows aqueous treatment; paper is placed between blotters or felts under moderate pressure. When cleaning and alkalization alone are not sufficient to stabilize the artifact, conservators may opt to mend and rebind the materials. Mending and filling techniques include narrow strips of torn Japanese tissue adhered with a reversible non-staining adhesive such as starch paste or methylcellulose. Paper can also be mended with heat- set tissue repair. Holes or paper losses are filled individually with Japanese paper, with paper pulp, or with a paper carefully chosen to match the original in weight, texture, and color. Books with broken sewing, loose or detached boards or leaves require special care. Several techniques are used in conservation binding. The original sewing in a volume is retained if this is possible but is sometimes reinforced using new linen thread and sewing supports.NEDCC, \\"Conservation Treatment for Bound Materials of Value,\\" Northeast Document Conservation Center, Accessed 26 April 2014, If the original binding is too deteriorated, the book may be rebound with new archival safe materials. Weak or brittle paper is reinforced by backing them with another sheet of paper. Japanese paper is sometimes used as a backing, adhered with a starch paste. When extensive conservation of the object is impossible or not cost-effective, reformatting techniques are employed to minimize treatments and excessive handling. Reformatting options include photocopying, digitization, and microfilming. Many libraries and universities have book copiers where the book can be supported at an angle, avoiding the damage to its structure that can be caused by forcing it flat. In spite of the digital revolution, preservation microfilming is still used. Microfilm can have a life expectancy of 500 or more years, and only needs light and magnification to read.Steve Dalton. \\"Microfilm and Microfiche\\". Northeast Document Conservation Center. Accessed 22 April 2014. Mass conservation preserves many books and documents with the same problems, which reduces the cost of treatment and individual handling. Given the great variety of material found in archival material that would require sorting and separate treatments, mass conservation is more often applied to library material than archival material. The only mass conservation treatment that can realistically be applied to archival material is preventive conservation by means of temperature and humidity-controlled environments. However, if archival material is sorted by material type, batch treatment can be applied to low to moderate value items. Batch treatment may include humidification, deacidification, or mending. Single-item treatment is required for high-value or complex books or documents that require detailed, individual documentation. Ethics According to Andrew Oddy, \\"modern scientific conservation is governed by an unwritten set of rules or ethics\\". There have been many failed attempts to codify these \\"rules\\" because conservation requires individual application and is dependent on the goals of the museum and curator; consequently, these approaches cannot be generalized. Paul N. Banks wrote \\"The Laws of Conservation\\", also known as The Ten Laws of Conservation; though never officially published, they have been widely shared by his students. The American Institute of Conservation (AIC) published a code of ethics and guidelines for conservation professionals involved in caring for cultural artifacts. Book and paper conservators strive to be sure that the treatments and alterations applied to the artifacts are reversible so they can be undone. Consequently, book conservators are trained in the physical and chemical properties of the materials with which they work. However, complete reversibility is often impossible, thus conservators must be conscientious of the long term effects of chemical and physical treatments. Furthermore, conservators must make decisions about which treatments best match the strength and material of the object. In some instances, conservators may decide that it is better to store the object and make a reproduction for use rather than treat it if no treatment options are available due to financial or technological limitations. Moreover, if treatment is used, it must be used as sparingly as possible to maintain the aesthetic and historical integrity of the artifact. Generally, conservation techniques aim to mend and stabilize the item so it can be stored and used long-term. Conservators must consider the ethics of how a book or document should be restored or replicated without losing its aesthetic and historical integrity. Another ethical aspect of book conservation is the detailed documentation of treatments and alterations including procedures and materials used. Photographic documentation is usually more detailed for single-item treatments than for batch treatments. A trained conservator can observe past treatments done on the book or document, but good documentation specifies the exact techniques and materials used. The cleaning and repair of paper documents and books are assigned to a professional conservator.AIC, \\"Caring for Your Treasures,\\" American Institute for Conservation of Historic & Artistic Works, Accessed 26 April 2014, . Many paper or book conservators are members of a professional body, such as the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) or the Guild of Bookworkers (both in the United States), the Archives and Records Association (in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or the Institute of Conservation (ICON) (in the United Kingdom).

It is the 88th episode overall. Plot The episode follows on from \\"The Roommate Transmogrification\\", where Raj and Penny slept together. When they emerged from Leonard's bedroom, the others saw them and Penny said \\"It's not what it looks like\\". The first scene takes place at lunch, with Sheldon wondering what Penny meant by her \\"brain teaser\\". After he comes up with the idea that Penny was checking Raj's anal region for pinworms, Leonard tells him that Penny and Raj did have sex, and that Penny was lying when she said it wasn't what it looked like. Raj and Howard then arrive. Howard and Leonard are both annoyed that Raj had sex with Penny, and Raj tries to defend himself by saying that they are in love. Leonard reveals to Howard that Raj used to like Bernadette, infuriating Howard further. Sheldon, sensing that Leonard is upset, calls Leonard's mother and the two converse through video chat. Leonard explains that while he doesn't want to get back with Penny, he cannot deal that she slept with one of his friends. He is also confused because his current girlfriend, Priya, is going to move back to India. His mother, despite her being an expert in psychology, parenting and child development, has no advice other than \\"Buck up, sissy pants\\". Amy arrives at Penny's apartment, and Amy tries to console her. She tells an apocryphal legend about Catherine the Great, a Russian leader in the 18th century who, according to the story, used a system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse. When Penny asks her how this is relevant to her, Amy says that she took part in \\"interspecies hanky-panky\\" yet people still refer to her as \\"the Great\\". Then Penny, wanting to avoid contact with Leonard and the others, asks to stay at Amy's house for a while. Raj finds out that Penny is staying there through Amy's Facebook page and shows up. Raj asks Penny out on a date, but Penny tells him that having sex with him was a mistake and that she wishes to just remain friends. Raj reveals that the previous night, he had trouble putting the condom on and ejaculated prematurely; the two did not actually have sex. She agrees not to tell anyone about this. During a paintball match against members of other Caltech departments, Sheldon appoints himself as captain of the guys' team. There is the lack of enthusiasm among the team due to the recent events. Sheldon, blaming himself, sacrifices himself to the geology department and the gang rush out to avenge him, and manage to claim a victory. As the guys celebrate their victory, they are interrupted by Penny, who announces her plans to move back to Nebraska, because of her failing acting career and her fractured relationship with the guys. As Leonard tries to comfort her, she is interrupted by a phone call from an agent who tells her she got a part in a hemorrhoid cream commercial. She changes her mind and stays in Pasadena because she is going to \\"be a star\\". The episode is concluded with everybody watching Penny's hemorrhoid commercial.

A two-seater with an engine of only , it demonstrated the ability of a small aircraft to cope with flights over the Alps in winter and to make transcontinental journeys of over 36,000 km. Design and development thumb Wingtip, aileron-linked \\"flap\\" on early L20 The Mercedes F7502 engine installation Hans Klemm's first light aircraft was the Daimler L15 and the L20 had much in common with it. Both were cantilever monoplanes with twin open, tandem cockpits and engines of very low power. The L20's low wing distinguished it from its predecessor and had the advantage of providing a low centre of gravity and better view during the landing approach as well as better protection for occupants in case of crash landings. The low-set wing also allowed a shorter undercarriage on the L20, which was otherwise like that of the L15 with the wheels independently mounted on pairs of centrally hinged V-struts and with vertical shock absorbing legs to the wing underside. Wheels were sometimes replaced by floats. Intended from the start for serial production, the L20's structure was simplified, with a pentagonal cross-section fuselage lacking the L15's rounded upper and lower surfaces. The fuselage was wooden framed with canvas covering. The overall strength of the structure, which had a safety factor of 12, was emphasised. The wing was tapered in planform and was built around two spars, though there were two variants of the internal wing structure. The first three aircraft, type L20 A1, had wings stiffened against torsion by internal wire bracing but later aircraft, type L20 B1, used a torsion box formed by plywood skin ahead of the rear spar. Like the later version of the L15, the L20 used a combination of conventional ailerons and unusual wingtip flaps, rotating about an axis well ahead of mid-chord. The ailerons were directly controlled from the cockpit as normal and the tip flaps were linked to them with external rods and cranks. On early examples these flaps were roughly square, with a side less than a half of the chord at the tip, but at some later time they were reshaped to produce wing curved tips. The wings could be detached at the root in about five minutes, reducing the width of the L20 to for road transport on a trailer pulled by a car. At the beginning of the design and testing period the absence of a suitable, serially produced light aircraft engine was a concern and the wing was therefore mounted so that it could be moved fore and aft to allow for the varying centre of gravity positions resulting from engines of different weight. A glider version was contemplated though not finally used. Instead, the flight programme began with the L20 powered by the Harley-Davidson motor cycle engine used in the L15. By mid 1925 this had been replaced with a new engine, the air-cooled, flat twin Mercedes F7502a, which Klemm had persuaded Daimler's engine group to design and build for the light aircraft market. The cost of flying the L20 was low as its cruise fuel consumption was only 63 mL/km (45 mpg). From 1926 the uprated Mercedes F7502b was fitted. The F7502 was central to the success of the L20, though it suffered from repeated rocker arm failures. Having failed to persuade the Daimler management to undertake series production of the L20 despite its early successes, in 1927 Klemm left to set up his own company, Klemm Light Aircraft in Sindelfingen, later moving to B√∂blingen. Thereafter the L20 was often known as the Klemm-Daimler L20 or sometimes the Daimler-Klemm L20. After 1926, new designs appeared under Klemm's name alone; for example the Klemm L25, later Kl25, was a revision of the L20 with a Salmson radial engine. Operational history The 1925 Round Germany Flight involved five circuits over a total distance of . Two early L20s and the twin-engined L21 competed against many aircraft from other German manufacturers. All three Daimler aircraft were very successful in the under class, with the L21 the overall winner, receiving 25,000 Goldmarks (worth ¬£1,250 in 1925) and the two L20's coming second and third and winning another 25,000 Goldmark between them. They also contributed to the award of first prize in the contest between German engined aircraft to Mercedes. Zeller See after crossing the Alps in winter The best known and most significant flight by the L20 was the wintertime crossing of the Alps in early 1926. Flight Magazine hailed this as the \\"Vindication of the Light 'Plane\\", in the sense that it showed small aircraft to be a practical vehicle for travel over difficult terrain and in uncertain weather. The pilot was Guritzer and the navigator/engineer von Lansdorff, both from Daimler. The flight began at Daimler's Sindelfingen base on 16 February. No special preparation such as fuel dumps were made in advance and carefully prepared maps were lost overboard early in the flight. The weather frustrated several attempts to cross the Alps but at last the L20 landed in of snow near Zeller See. The return journey reached eastwards, skirting the Alps via Budapest and Vienna and arriving home at Sindelfingen on 16 March. During 1927 the L20 continued to contest competitions such as the Lilienthal Prize, winning most of the prizes in the lightplane class and making overseas visits such as the one to the UK in July. Private owners also took them on long tours, such as the 1927 North European flights of Anton Riediger but no-one went further with their L20 than Baron Freidrich Carl von K√∂nig-Warthausen, who set off on 11 August 1928 on a world tour, beginning with a flight to Moscow, then on to Tehran, Calcutta and Singapore. From there he and the L20 crossed to North America by sea but flew across the United States, arriving in New York City on 3 September 1929 after travelling from Berlin.

Life He was born on 3 March 1790 at Yetholm, Roxburghshire to Margaret Herbert, of a Northumbrian family, and George Story, a parish schoolmaster. After receiving elementary education at home he entered the University of Edinburgh in 1805, associating with Thomas Pringle, the son of a neighbouring farmer. From July 1811 to the beginning of 1815 Story was tutor in several families, preparing at the same time for entrance into the Church of Scotland. One of his tutorial posts was in the family of Lord Dalhousie, his youngest pupil being James Andrew Broun Ramsay, whose friendship continued through life. Licensed as a preacher in July 1815, Story was in December appointed assistant at Rosneath, Dumbartonshire. Ordained minister of the parish on 26 March 1818, Story was introduced to his congregation by Thomas Chalmers. Story defended his friend and neighbour, John McLeod Campbell of Row, who was deposed in 1831 by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for his views on the Atonement. He was himself threatened by the issue, but it died down. In 1830 his parishioner Mary Campbell professed to have received the gift of tongues; and, though Story exposed her imposture, she found disciples in London, and was given credence by Edward Irving. Her claims led to the founding of the Catholic Apostolic Church. Story remained in his charge at the Great Disruption of 1843. In 1853 saw a new parish church erected and a supplementary church placed on his southern borders‚Äîwhich he largely paid for‚Äîfor a young community when Lochlongside was feued. After a period of weak health, he died on 22 November 1859. He was buried in Rosneath churchyard, and a monument by the sculptor William Brodie, was placed on the wall of the chancel in the parish church. Works In 1811 appeared The Institute, a heroic poem in four cantos, written by Story and Thomas Pringle. In 1829 Story published, under the title of Peace in Believing, a memoir of a devout girl named Isabella Campbell, sister of the Mary Campbell who later professed speaking in tongues. Story also wrote on his parish for the Statistical Account of Scotland of 1841. Family Story married, in 1828, Helen Boyle, daughter of Mr Dunlop of Keppoch, Dumbartonshire, and was survived by her and two children.

While the name uvalino means \\"small berries\\", ampelographers believe that the name may be derived from uvario which in the local Piedmontese dialect was used to denote wine grapes that were primarily minor blending varieties.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 1106-1107 Allen Lane 2012 In recent years, the high levels of the antioxidant resveratrol of Uvalino has brought attention to the grape due to its potential health benefits.S. Suriano, P Tamborra, M Savino, L Tarricone Nero di Troia, Susumaniello and Uvalino: Italian Autochthonous Wine Grape Varieties with High Content of Stilbenic and Flavinoid Compounds CRA - Unita di Ricerca per l'uva da Tavola e la Vitivinicoltura in ambiente Mediterraneo - Cantina Sperimentale di Barletta, 76121 Barletta, Italy History Uvalino has been historically associated with the province of Asti, particularly around the commune of Nizza Monferrato. The first documented account of Uvalino was of the grape variety growing in the communes of Castelletto Molina and Nizza Monferrato in the province of Asti by botanist Giorgio Gallesio in 1831. In 2006, DNA analysis revealed that Uvalino has a likely parent- offspring relationship with the nearly extinct Piemontese grape Neretto di Marengo. Uvalino, itself, was on the verge of extinction until the late 20th century when winemaker Mariuccia Borio was inspired by wine made by famous Barolo winemaker Renato Ratti from a small planting of Uvalino at his Villa Pattono estate in La Morra in the province of Cuneo. Reminded of a wine from her childhood, Borio began working with Ratti and the Asti extension of the Institute of Experimental Viticulture (Istituto Sperimentale per la Viticoltura) of Conegliano Veneto to revive plantings of the grape variety. By 2002, their efforts got Uvalino placement on the official registry of Italian grape varieties. Viticulture Uvalino is a late-ripening grape variety that can be very robust and resistant to many viticultural hazards such as botrytis bunch rot. Its low-sensitivity to many late season hazards like fungal infections allows growers to give the grapes long \\"hang time\\" on the vine before harvest to achieve more ripe phenolics flavors. Wine regions Vineyards in the Asti region of Piedmont where Uvalino is almost exclusively grown. Being only added to the official registry of Italian grape varieties in 2002, there is not yet an official census count of how many plantings of Uvalino there are in Italy. However, ampelographers believe that the grape is almost exclusively grown in the Piedmont region. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, as a varietal, Uvalino tends to produce full- bodied wines with noticeable tannins and acidity levels with aromas of sweet spices and red fruits. Synonyms Over the years, Uvalino has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Cunaiola (in Canavese), Freisone (in Tortona), Lambrusca (in Roero) and Lambruschino (in Roero). However, the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) currently does not recognize any official synonyms for Uvalino but does note that Uvalino is used as synonym for the Italian wine grape Pistolino and Uvalino nero is a synonym for Croatina.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Uvalino Accessed: April 14th, 2014Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Pistolino Accessed: April 14th, 2014Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Croatina Accessed: April 14th, 2014 References Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Uvalino"},{"id":"42492270","text":"Christine Williams may refer to: *Christine Williams (model) (born 1945), English model and actor *Christine Williams (nutritionist), English professor and university pro-vice-chancellor *Christine Williams (Tangle), fictional character on Tangle *Christine Blair, n√©e Christine Williams, fictional character on The Young and the Restless *Chrissie Williams, Christine Williams, a fictional character on Holby City See also *Chris Williams (disambiguation) *Christina Williams, American murder victim ","title":"Christine Williams"},{"id":"42492273","text":"Marc Edward May (born January 1, 1956) is a former American football tight end who played one season with the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League.

Advantages The NOMAD has a boat-shaped hull made from aluminum, and it provides relatively high cost effectiveness and excellent long-term survivability in severe weather. These buoys are highly directional and have a quick rotational response and stability. There have been no known capsizings of 6-meter NOMAD hulls. The relatively small size of the NOMAD allows for easy transport across land. Development The NOMAD hull was developed from the \\"Roberts buoy\\", which was a , boat-shaped buoy developed in the early 1940s, by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, to measure strong tidal currents. The buoy's performance was satisfactory, but its limited size significantly restricted the buoy's use in other areas. In July 1946, the Bureau of Ships became involved in a program to develop automatic weather station buoys. As a perspective part of this program, they conducted a preliminary investigation into the feasibility of mooring a buoy. The investigation concluded that the buoy's hull size was of insufficient length to be moored in 3600 ft of water. To support such a mooring, a similar shaped hull had to be 20 ft (6 m) long and displace approximately 20,000 lb. This was to become the prototype of the buoy now known as the NOMAD. The NOMAD was the first of such stations to be anchored successfully for a substantial period in more than 11,000 feet of water. It was also the first anchored automated station to detect formation of a hurricane and alert weather observers on land. The station was developed as part of the ocean test and evaluation program, started in 1957, for the Bureau of Naval Weapons, with the National Bureau of Standards responsible for technical direction. Use Today, the NOMAD is used for monitoring meteorological, oceanographic and water quality parameters, all over the world. The U.S. National Weather Service currently has 17 NOMADs in operation. NOMADs have also been used by the Meteorological Service of Canada for over 25 years and there are now 3 NOMADs monitoring Canadian waters.

Einstein's Blackboard is a blackboard which physicist Albert Einstein (1879‚Äì1955) used on 16 May 1931 during his lectures while visiting the University of Oxford in England. The blackboard is one of the most iconic objects in the collection of the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford. Overview The lecture in which the blackboard was used was the second of three, delivered at Rhodes House in South Parks Road. Einstein's visit to give the Rhodes Lectures, and also to receive an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Oxford University on 23 May 1931, was hosted by the physicist Frederick Lindemann. Einstein's first lecture was on relativity, the second on cosmology, and the third on unified field theory. All the lectures were delivered in German. A brief report of the second lecture was given in The TimesThe Times, 18 May 1931. and in Nature. A summary of all three lectures can be found in the Archives of the Oxford Museum for the History of Science. The blackboard was rescued with another board by dons (including the chemist E. J. Bowen, zoologist Gavin de Beer, and historian of science Robert Gunther) and formally donated by the Warden of Rhodes House, Sir Francis James Wylie. The writing on the blackboard, although ephemeral in nature, is of historic interest because the equations displayed are taken from a model of the universe proposed by Einstein in May 1931 known as The Friedmann-Einstein universe.Einstein, A. 1931. Zum kosmologischen Problem der allgemeinen Relativit√§tstheorie Sitzungsb.K√∂nig. Preuss. Akad. 235-237O‚ÄôRaifeartaigh, C. and McCann, B.

(2013). ‚ÄòCyclic models of the relativistic universe: the early history‚Äô. Physics ArXiv 1308.0932. The last three lines on the blackboard are estimates of the density of matter in the universe œÅ, the radius of the universe P and the timespan t of the expansion of the universe respectively (\\"L.J.\\" on the blackboard indicates \\"light years\\" in German). It has recently been shown that these estimates contain a systematic numerical error. The blackboard is considered a \\"mutant\\" object or artefact because it no longer serves the philosophical purpose of a blackboard, namely temporary information storage. By keeping Einstein's writings on it for ever, the blackboard became something else and can only regain to its original purpose by being wiped. Exactly this was done to a second blackboard used by Einstein during the lecture that was also donated to the museum. This blackboard was accidentally wiped clean by a museum cleaner and is kept around as a reminder as to what a difference thin layer of chalk can make Einstein returned to Oxford again in 1932 and 1933 before he settled at Princeton University in the United States for the rest of his life. The science of the blackboard In 2013 it was pointed out that the equations on the Oxford blackboard had been taken directly from a key paper on relativistic cosmology written by Einstein in April 1931 and published in the Proceedings of the Royal Prussian Academy of Science on 9 May that year. The paper, known as The Friedmann-Einstein universe, is of historic significance because it constituted the first scientific publication in which Einstein embraced the possibility of a cosmos of time-varying radius. In the paper, Einstein adopts Alexander Friedman's 1922 analysisFriedman, A. 1922. √úber die Kr√ºmmung des Raumes. Zeit. Physik. 10 : 377-386 of relativistic models of a universe of time-varying radius and positive curvature, but sets the cosmological constant to zero, declaring it redundant, predicting a universe that expands and contracts over time. (The work is sometimes known as the Friedman-Einstein model of the universeNorth, J.D. 1965. The Measure of the Universe: A History of Modern Cosmology . Oxford University Press p132Rindler, W. 1969. Essential Relativity: Special, General and Cosmological. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company New York p261). With the use of Edwin Hubble's observations of a linear redshift/distance relation for the spiral nebulae, Einstein extracts from his model estimates of œÅ ~ 10‚àí26 g/cm3, P ~ 108 light-years and t ~ 1010 years for the density of matter, the radius of the cosmos and the timespan of the cosmic expansion respectively. These values are displayed in the last three lines on the Oxford blackboard (although the units of measurement are not specifically stated for the density estimate, cgs units are implied by the other calculations). The role of the blackboard in clarifying an error It has also been noted that the numerical estimates of cosmic parameters in Einstein's 1931 paper ‚Äì and on the blackboard ‚Äì contain a systematic error. Analysis of the 1931 paper shows that, given the contemporaneous Hubble constant of 500 km s‚àí1Mpc‚àí1, Einstein's estimates of cosmic density, radius and timespan should have been œÅ ~ 10‚àí28 g/cm3, P ~ 108 light-years and t ~ 109 years respectively. One line on the blackboard, not included in the published paper, makes the nature of Einstein's error clear. In the fourth line on the blackboard, Einstein obtains a value of 10‚àí53 cm‚àí2 for the quantity D2, defined in the top line of the blackboard as D = (1/c). (1/P).(dP/dt), i.e., the Hubble constant divided by the speed of light. Simple calculation shows that the contemporaneous value of the Hubble constant in fact implied a value of D2 ~ 10‚àí55 cm‚àí2 (or 10‚àí51 m‚àí2) for this quantity. It appears that Einstein stumbled in converting megaparsecs to cm, giving a density of matter that was too high by a factor of a hundred, a cosmic radius that was too low by a factor of ten, and a timespan for the expansion that was too high by a factor of ten. These errors were corrected in a later review of relativistic cosmology written by Einstein in 1945.

Early life Albert Purchas was born in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, Wales in 1825, the son of Robert Whittlesey Purchas and Marianne Guyon. He was the brother of Arthur Guyon Purchas. He emigrated to Melbourne in 1851, and soon established a private practice as a surveyor and architect.An early story is that one of his first jobs, when he would have been about 25 year old, was a position under Surveyor-General Robert Hoddle, and disagreeing with him over the line for St Kilda Road, appealed to Governor La Trobe, and successfully got the road diverted around the hill which eventually became the site of the Shrine of Remembrance. There may not be much truth to this since by 1851 St Kilda Road was already a well worn track running around the hill, the top of which LaTrobe had reserved for a Government House in 1840. On 1 Nov 1854 in St Kilda, he married Eliza Anne Swyer (c1825‚Äì1869), the eldest daughter of Robert Swyer, of Kersal, Lancashire.Suzie Zades, Biographical Family Report for Albert Purchas Albert and Eliza had a large family, with 10 children, although several died young.

Architectural practice Christ Church St Kilda 1853-7 Purchas was soon joined his brother-in law Charles R Swyer in the partnership of Purchas & Swyer, which lasted from 1856 to 1862, after which he again practiced alone up to about 1891. Purchas had his offices at 81 Little Collins;Victoria and its Metropolis ii, p 529 and later 30 Queens Street, 81 Chancery Lane and finally 462 Little Collins Street. Alone or with Swyer purchase is said to have designed over 140 houses, offices, churches, banks and cemetery buildings in Victoria in his long career. Berkely Hall St Kilda dating from 1854 is one of his first buildings, and still exists, though the original house is obscured by an early 20thC verandah.St Kilda Historical Society Another notable early design was the head office of the Melbourne Savings Bank, built on the corner Flinders Lane and Market Street in 1857-58, in an elaborately detailed Renaissance Revival style. His churches were mostly Gothic Revival, built for the Anglican Church, along with some parsonages, while most of the bank buildings were Renaissance Revival designs for the Bank of Australasia.Albert Purchas: architect, soldier, inventor 19th JUNE 2013 He also designed city buildings in the 1860s and 70s, such as the Mutual Insurance Co, Northern Insurance Co, and the first premises for George & George, destroyed by fire in 1889. St Georges, East St Kilda, 1877-80 One of his most outstanding designs is St George's Presbyterian Church in Chapel Street, St Kilda (1877‚Äì80), in a striking polychrome brick Gothic Revival style, unusually carried on through to the interior.

He was a long time member of the Cemetery Trust, serving as secretary from 1876-1886. He was also Chairman of the Boroondara General Cemetery Board of Trustees 1867 to 1909, and designed many aspects of the cemetery, including the landscape, the cast iron entrance gates (1889), the rotunda (1890) and the surrounding brick wall (1895‚Äì6).

He was the son and successor of Hasan I. Biography Map of northern Iran =Alliance with the Khwarazmians= In 1173, after the death of his father, Ardashir I ascended the Bavandid throne. Right after the accession of Ardashir, his kingdom was invaded by the Khwarazmian prince Sultan Shah and the ruler of Khorasan, Mu'ayyid al-Din Ai-Aba, who captured several fortresses and cities from Ardashir. One year later, however, Mu'ayyid al-Din Ai-Aba was killed by Sultan Shah's brother Tekish. Ardashir quickly used the opportunity to reconquer Damghan and Bastam. Ardashir shortly made an alliance with Tekish, and made an agreement that when Tekish's daughter became old enough, she should marry Ardashir. In 1183, Tekish's daughter was sent along with her mother to the Bavandid capital of Sari, at which time the Oghuz leader Malik Dinar plundered the eastern parts of Mazandaran. Tekish shortly arrived at Gorgan, and forced the Oghuz leader to leave Tabaristan. He then demanded that Ardashir cede Gorgan to him, to which Ardashir was forced to agree. Ardashir also shortly married Tekish's daughter. =War with the Paduspanids= Ardashir now focused on his Paduspanid vassals, who were getting too powerful; he took much of Kai Ka'us I's territory which had been given to the latter during the reign of Ardashir's grandfather Shah Ghazi Rustam IV. Ardashir also ordered his general Mubariz al-Din Arjasf to attack Kai Ka'us. Sometime later, however, Kai Ka'us' son Justan died, and only his 1 year old grandson Zarrinkamar survived, whom Ardashir I agreed to raise and make ruler of the Paduspanid dynasty when the latter had grown up. Kai Ka'us shortly died in 1184. After his death, the nobles of the Paduspanid capital of Ruyan made his nephew Hazarasp II the new ruler of the dynasty. Unlike his predecessor, Hazarasp was a tyrant; he lost allegiance from several of his vassals by having some of their relatives killed, and making peace with the Ismailis, who were the most hated enemy of the Bavandids and several local rulers. Ardashir, after having received the news of Hazarasp's actions, ordered Arjasf to invade Ruyan. Hazarasp managed to flee from Ruyan, and seek shelter with the Ismailis, who agreed to help him; Hazarasp shortly invaded Ruyan and killed its governor. Ardashir, greatly enraged by these actions, re-captured Ruyan and made Hezabr al-Din Khvorshid the new governor of the city. Hazarasp, after several failures to re-conquer Ruyan, asked Ardashir for forgiveness. He was, however, instead imprisoned by Ardashir, and was secretly murdered by Hezabr al-Din in case that Ardashir would restore Ruyan to Hazarasp. =War with the Khwarazmians= Tekish, during his campaigns gained absolute and non-disputed control over Khorasan, and thus some local rulers and emirs declared independence from Ardashir, as they preferred the lordship of the powerful ruler Tekish. This degraded relations between Ardashir and his Tekish. Ardashir shortly captured and killed one of his disloyal vassals, which made Tekish in revenge invade Mazandaran and devastate the eastern parts of the region. Ardashir shortly began to adopt an anti-Khwarazmian policy, and began improving his relations with the Seljuq Sultan Toghrul III, the military ruler Pahlavan ibn Ildeniz and the Abbasid Caliph al-Nasir. In 1191, Tekish occupied the eastern territories of Ardashir and demanded Ardashir to cede Bastam and Damghan, which he did have no choice to but to cede. One year later, Ardashir sent an army to aid Toghrul III in capturing Ray. He shortly made an alliance with the latter and made an alliance with his former enemy Sultan Shah, who was in Merv and threatening the stability of Tekish's kingdom. Ardashir shortly recaptured Gorgan, while Sultan Shah captured the important city of Nishapur. Ardashir's hope to destroy Tekish's kingdom, however, came to an end when Sultan Shah was killed in 1193. Things began to look more grim for Ardashir when Tekish killed Toghrul at Ray the following year. Ardashir shortly tried to regain his good relations with Tekish by sending an army under his youngest son Rukn al-Dawla Qarin to aid Tekish in his campaigns. The army, was, however, removed from Tekish's service, who sent an army under his amir Sutash to punish Ardashir for having made an alliance with his enemies. Sutash shortly devastated parts of Ardashir's domains, including the important city of Sari, which was now under the control of a Khwarazmian governor. In 1199, Tekish made another invasion of Ardashir's territories, and took control over Firuzkuh, Ustunavand, and Folul. He shortly ordered Ardashir to send his son Sharaf al-Muluk to work under Tekish. During the same period, a group of nobles, under Ardashir's second son, Rustam V, plotted to overthrow Ardashir, and to crown Rustam V as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty. The amir Sutash took the advantage of the plot to settle permanently in Sari in order to increase his influence over Mazandaran, while another amir named Argush, occupied Amol. Ardashir then defeated the conspiracy and imprisoned Rustam V. He shortly defeated Argush and regained control of Amol. Shortly after Tekish dismissed Sharaf al-Muluk and sent him back to Ardashir. He demanded that Ardashir send his daughter back. Ardashir, however, disobeyed this order. Shortly Tekish died, before he could punish Ardashir. He was succeeded by his son, Muhammad II. =Death= After Tekish's death, the power of the Khwarazmian dynasty in western Iran collapsed and all his former vassals rebelled. Muhammad II, was not able to reconquer lost Khwarazmian territory since he was busy in the east, which gave Ardashir the opportunity to reconquer Damghan, Firuzkuh, Folul and Ustunawand. When the Ghurid Sultan Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad invaded Khwarezm in 1204, he sent a delegate to Ardashir, who agreed to recognize his authority. However, Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad was himself shortly defeated and expelled from Khwarezm in 1205. Ardashir shortly died himself. About the same time, his heir Sharaf al-Muluk died, and the succession passed to another son, Rustam V, who was freed from prison and was brought to the throne at Amol.

It is located at the meeting point of the townlands of Clonmoyle East (which lies within the civil parish and catholic parish of Aghabullogue) and Knockanenagark (which lies within the civil parish of Magourney and catholic parish of Aghabullogue). The aqueduct was constructed by Henry Leader of nearby Clonmoyle House, with the intention of conveying water, for irrigation purposes, over a glen and the Dripsey River, to the Clonmoyle area. The venture was ultimately unsuccessful, leading to the structure becoming known as 'Leader's Folly'. The Irish Tourist Association survey of 1944 claims that it consisted of twelve piers, standing in line across a deep valley, the highest being 85 feet in height, and with some piers having since been dismantled for building material. The piers were said to have been erected c. 1860 to support a water chute, with water being piped for some 2 miles, and fed into the chute. The aqueduct was said to have carried water but once. The survey goes on to state that Leader was a philanthropic individual, whose experiments were often mainly intended to provide employment locally. Having been dissatisfied with progress, he is said to have engaged direct labour, employing local labourers and boys. One of these youths, disguised as an adult, was said to have received full pay, leading to other youths subsequently acting likewise and receiving full pay. This particular scheme and others were said to have been financed by Leader mortgaging his property, and that the Bank were the loser after his death, following discovery of imperfect title. Milner (1975) advises that the aqueduct was not used. The reality is that it was operational, but not satisfactorily for the purposes intended. By the early twentieth century, the structure was depicted as an 'Aqueduct (in ruins)'.

She was later active in the Correspondence Art scene, collaborating with Fluxus artists including Dick Higgins and George Brecht. She is credited with introducing the Ozalid process, an ammonia-based technique for the reproduction of industrial drawings, to the art world.  Early life and education  Mary Ashley was born Mary Tsaltas in Peabody, Massachusetts in 1931. She was the daughter of Greek immigrants. She went on to study visual art at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston.  The ONCE group and the Truck events  In February and March 1961, a group of composers and electronic musicians in Ann Arbor, Michigan, including Robert Ashley, George Cacioppo, Gordon Mumma, Roger Reynolds and Donald Scavarda, organized a series of concerts of contemporary music called the ONCE Festival of Musical Premiers. This first festival blossomed into an annual event that was held over the course of six years, and spawned a series of affiliated groups, festivals and workshops, including a theatrical ensemble called the ONCE Group. Mary Ashley was the driving force behind this group and she is credited with influencing the direction of the eponymous festival itself, which after 1963 changed from what was predominantly a festival of contemporary music to something more multi-disciplinary and theatrical, involving dance, theater, sculpture, public theater and what would later come to be known as performance art. In May 1963, Ashley staged a street event in Ann Arbor called ‚ÄúTruck: Unscheduled Private Events in the Midst of an Unsuspecting Public Audience.‚Äù In it, the audience exiting a local orchestral concert were confronted by a group of artists and performers led by Mary Ashley awaiting them in parked cars. In one was Ashley herself, sprawled across the seat and playing dead. In a van nearby a pianist was playing, while other performers, including Robert Ashley, Gordon and Jackie Mumma, and Caroline Cohen passed out sandwiches and engaged in other mundane, albeit incongruous activities. Although Ashley had obtained permission to stage the event, the ensuing chaos and traffic resulted in the arrival of the police. Ashley considered the event a huge success, and her ‚ÄúTruck‚Äù ensemble continued to perform annually, eventually performing some of the composer Robert Ashley‚Äôs best known and most ambitious works of the 1960s, including That Morning Thing, The Trial of Anne Opie Wehrer, and Kittyhawk. Robert Ashley has described these ‚ÄúTruck events‚Äù as ‚Äúwonderful art and invariably large-scale social disturbances.‚Äù Another performance typical of Ashley‚Äôs pieces this period was a ‚Äúsporting event‚Äù called ‚ÄúWalk.\\" Staged in 1963 as part of a series of music and performances at the Red Door Gallery in Detroit, ‚ÄúWalk‚Äù involved an enormous ink pad, which audience members stepped into. They were then encouraged to mark up the walls of the gallery space using their feet ‚Äî some participants balanced on each other‚Äôs shoulders, held each other up horizontally or otherwise cooperated to create elaborate patterns, including two elaborate ‚Äúmaps,‚Äù the outlines of which were created by picking up the ink pad and placing it against the wall. The approximately two-hour-long event‚Äôs duration was fixed by a tape of Ashley‚Äôs voice reading a long series of numbers recorded while on a two-hour-long walk in Ann Arbor. A good example of the increasingly theatrical direction of the ONCE festival was 1965‚Äôs ONCE AGAIN Festival. Held on the roof of a parking structure in Ann Arbor, there were film screenings, dance performances by six of the (former) Judson dancers, including Trisha Brown and Steve Paxton, as well as a premiere of John Cage‚Äôs ‚ÄúTalk I,‚Äù a piece that involves the projection and modification of a conversation between the composer and friends. The opening concert, held on February 11, 1965 included a performance piece by Mary Ashley called ‚ÄúThe Jelloman.‚Äù The piece, ‚Äúa study of narcissism‚Äù is best remembered for an unintentional wardrobe malfunction involving performer Robert Sheff (later renamed ‚ÄúBlue Gene‚Äù Tyranny), who remembers ‚ÄúI was on a table getting a massage from a guy dressed as an astronaut, the towel came off.‚Äù Ashley also produced some of the ONCE Festivals most memorable and scandalous posters, including one for its fourth iteration in the spring of 1964. It is a 10‚Äù x 16‚Äô‚Äô sheet of paper, folded accordion-style into a 10‚Äù x 2‚Äù rectangle. unfolded, it shows a nude woman lying across the lunch counter of Ann Arbor‚Äôs Red‚Äôs Rite Spot, discreetly shielded in one place by a cake dish. Behind her are ONCE composers Mumma, Robert Ashley, Scavarda and Cacioppo, dressed in dark suits and looking like gangsters. The reverse side of the sheet of paper was printed with the program for the festival. According to Robert Ashley the poster was a ‚Äútribute to the Judson Dance Theater, which had recently restaged Manet‚Äôs Olympia to great critical dislike in The New York Times.‚Äù Between 1964 and 1968 Mary Ashley performed occasionally with what would become the Sonic Arts Union, a touring group comprising musicians and composers associated with the ONCE festivals. Its core members were composers Mumma, Robert Ashley, Alvin Lucier and later David Behrman but on some tours this group expanded to include works and performances by Mary Ashley, Mary Lucier, Barbara Lloyd and Shigeko Kubota. This expanded group traveled to, among other places, Europe. Mary Lucier remembers ‚Äúthe extraordinary energy‚Äù of one European tour that included all four women.  Later years  Between 1968 and 1971, Mary Ashley performed in Dr. Chicago, a trilogy of darkly comedic experimental films directed by Ann Arbor Film Festival founder George Manupelli. In it, she plays the role of Sheila Marie, the girlfriend to the trilogy‚Äôs title character, a quack ‚Äúmedical imposter‚Äù played by Alvin Lucier. Other performers in these films included such avant garde luminaries as Robert Ashley, Steve Paxton, Pauline Oliveros and Israeli mime Claude Kipnis. Ashley is credited with introducing the Ozalid process, an ammonia-based technique for the reproduction of industrial drawings, to the contemporary art world in the late 1960s. One of the posters she created using this process was auctioned at a benefit for the Experiments in Art and Technology group cofounded by Billy Kluver, Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Whitman and Fred Waldhauer. She moved to the Bay Area in 1969, where she remained for the rest of her life. In the 1970s Ashley began working in the field of video art, and also did a series of stenciled and painted room-sized installations called ‚ÄúOases,‚Äù before turning her attention increasingly toward landscape paintings, particularly of the desert, which she loved. She taught at institutions including Virginia Commonwealth University, the California College of Arts and Crafts, and the Ontario College of Art in Toronto. Ashley died of Alzheimer's disease in 1996, survived by her husband Murray Korngold and her son with Robert Ashley, Sam Ashley.

She has created content under the Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Dynamite Comics, Image Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and IDW Publishing labels. A large portion of Chin's work has been in creating comic book covers.  Career  Chin's early work with DC began with Guy Gardner Warrior. She later progressed to work on a number of variant covers, mini-series, and special projects, including Xena: Warrior Princess, Vampirella, Tomb Raider, Red Sonja, and Wynonna Earp, among others. Her collaborations include work alongside her husband Arthur Adams, comic writer Gail Simone, and frequent cover art projects with Ivan Nunes.  Style  Chin's work on Vampirella has been described as similar in style to that seen in Mucha paintings. Her depictions of superheroes and warriors has been grounded in her belief that costumes need to match the attitude of the characters wearing them.  Personal life  Chin is married to fellow comics artist Arthur Adams, whom she met at the 1996 San Diego Comic-Con. The two have inked each others' pencils. As of 1997 they lived in Portland, Oregon.DeAngelo, Danny (November/December 1997). \\"Art Adams: King of the Monster Artists\\". G-Fan. pp. 22‚Äì25. They later moved to San Francisco, California, before settling in Walnut Creek. In March 2019, while at a Chicago airport during her journey to the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, Chin suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage, or stroke, resulting from a brain aneurysm, and broke an ankle during the fall that followed her loss of consciousness. Following emergency brain surgery on March 22 Chin told Bleeding Cool that she suffered no loss of cognitive or motor functioning. A GoFundMe page was set up to help defray her medical bills, while Dynamite Entertainment announced it would release a lithograph of Chin's artwork that served as the cover of Vampirella #20 in 2001, in order to raise additional funds. Any surplus funds would go to the Hero Initiative charity.  Awards  Chin received an Inkpot Award at Comic-Con International in 2017.

It is known for its solidarity based economy and cooperative companies that produce cheeses, chocolates, dried mushrooms and fruits, alpaca wool yarn and textiles. The products are sold under the brand Salinerito. Panoramic view  History  The history of Salinas began long before the Spanish conquest, the first inhabitants were Tomabelas tribe, Chimbus tribe and Simiatug tribe, in 1884 it was named civil parish, but in 1970 it began to develop vertiginously with the support of Italian clergy, missionaries and international NGOs, such as the Ecuadorian Populorum Progressio Fund (created by Monsignor C√°ndido Rada), Swiss Technical Cooperation, etc.; as well as the initiative of its people to seek progress for the community through Minkas (ancient work cooperatives of the inhabitants of a community) to subsequently develop a system of self-management in certain activities.
