Pavlov; December 28, 1878 - September 1, 1938) was a Russian Bolshevik, Soviet statesman and political figure who served as People's Commissar of Finance between 1926 and 1930. Until recently, his date of death was believed to have been June 30, 1943. Biography Born at Simbirsk in a family of Russian ethnicity, Bryukhanov was expelled from Moscow University in 1899 for his political activities, readmitted under an amnesty, only to be expelled again in 1901. He then enroleld in Kazan University, became involved in revolutionary activities again, and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1902, becoming a member of its regional committee in Kazan in 1903. In that same year, he was arrested and deported to Vologda In 1904, he was in prison in Msocow, when he heard for the first time about the split that had occurred in August 1903 between Vladimir Lenin's Bolsheviks and Julius Martov's Mensheviks, and sided with the Bolsheviks. He was a Bolshevik delegate to the RSDLP Congress in London in 1907. In 1907 Bryukhanov moved to Ufa, where he edited the party's local newspaper Ufimsky Rabochiy (The Ufa Worker). During the Russian Revolution of 1917, Bryukhanov was the head of the Bolshevik committee in Ufa and, after the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917, became a member of the regional revolutionary committee and its Commissar of Supplies. In February 1918 he was made a member of the collegium (governing body) of the Peoples' Commissariat of Supplies and in June 1918, he became Deputy People's Commissar with responsibilities for food supplies in the Moscow region.See Silvana Malle. The Economic Organization of War Communism 1918-1921, Cambridge University Press, 1985 (2002 paperback edition), p.339. From August 1919, Bryukhanov simultaneously served as Chairman of the Special Supplies Commission of the Eastern Front and then, from January 1920 until September 1922, as head of the Main Supplies Directorate of the Red Army. Bryukhanov was put in charge of the People's Commissariat of Supplies in December 1921. With the creation of the USSR in December 1922, Bryukhanov became the first head of the People's Commissariat of Supplies of the new federation on July 6, 1923. On May 14, 1924, the Commissariat was abolished and Bryukhanov was made deputy People's Commissar of Finance. When the head of the Commissariat, Grigory Sokolnikov, supported Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev in their unsuccessful opposition to the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in late 1925, Stalin replaced Sokolnikov with the less influential and apolitical Bryukhanov on January 18, 1926.See Samuel A. Oppenheim. \\"Between right and left: Grigorii Yakovlevich Sokolnikov and the development of the Soviet state, 1921-1929\\", in Slavic Review, Winter 1989. Available online as of March 2006. At the 15th Party Congress in December 1927, Bryukhanov was elected candidate (non-voting) member of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party,See USSR Facts and Figures a position which he kept until the 17th Party Congress in January 1934. In early August 1930, Stalin ordered a purge of Bryukhanov's Commissariat in a letter to Vyacheslav Molotov: On October 18, 1930, Bryukhanov and the chairman of the State Bank, Georgy Pyatakov, were held responsible for surging inflation and fired from their posts. Bryukhanov was replaced with Grigori Fyodorovich GrinkoSee Hiroaki Kuromiya. Stalin's Industrial Revolution: Politics and Workers, 1928-1932, Cambridge University Press, 1988, p.267. and appointed Deputy Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Moscow Oblast Soviet. In April 1931, he was made Deputy People's Commissar of Supplies of the USSR. He also served as Deputy Chairman of the Sovnarkom's Central Commission on grain yields in 1933-1937. Bryukhanov was arrested by the NKVD secret police on February 3, 1938, during the Great Purge. He was sentenced to death and executed on September 1, 1938. The Soviet government cleared him of all charges in 1956 as part of the first wave of destalinization. However, the date of his death was given as June 30, 1943 as part of the government's policy to downplay the extent of the Great Purge by falsifying the dates of its victims' deathsSee, for example, John L. H. Keep. A History of the Soviet Union 1945-1991, Oxford University Press, 1995, p.79: \\"In such [non-survivor] cases the document often contained a fraudulent statement as to the date and circumstances of the victim's death\\".

Name Upperlands takes its name from the townland of Upperland (a townland of 568 acres) in which part of it lies (the rest lies in the townland of Tirgarvil (a townland of 435 acres). The townland of Upperland gets its name from the garbled pronunciation of the Irish √Åth an Phoirt Leathain. This has historically been anglicised as Aghfortlany, Aportlaughan, Apportlane, Amfordlan, Ampurtain and Ampertaine. The latter is the name of the local primary school. History Upperlands owes its existence to the linen industry and the Clark family who established the first linen mill there in 1736. Subsequent development of the industry led to the construction of substantial residences and small groups of workers homes, and shaped the form and character of Upperlands. Boyne Row (a group of listed buildings), in its riverside setting, represents workers housing, built by the mill-owners. There are four-man-made lakes or \\"dams\\" in Upperlands. These used to serve the linen mills. They are Craig's dam, Island dam, Green dam and Lapping-room dam. There is a scenic walk around the dams and they are kept stocked with fish for the benefit of anglers. The Clady River flows through the woodland and then through the town. Water is drawn from the river south of Amportane Bridge into 4 manmade mill lakes known as clarkes or upperlands dams and flows out through a 6 foot brick pipe tunnel back into the river. The river in the town itself is easy access just below the town bridge and fishable down to the Tirgarvil bridge on the southeast end of the town there is also an abandoned singlespan railway bridge hidden down there which can be accessed to the top from the river but there is no parapet or railings. The Grillagh River flows to the southwest of the village this slightly smaller tributary is just as good as the main river in terms of fishability Ampertain (or Ampertaine) House is a plain late-Georgian type two storey house built by Alexander Clark (1785-1871) in Upperlands around 1835. The front was elongated by a two-storey wing of similar style added in 1915. It also features a Victorian conservatory. It is a Grade B1 listed building which adjoins the main mill building complex of Clark's Mill. Amenities Upperlands monument to the linen industry The village has a small shop called Junes Superstore, and a Royal British Legion and also a community centre. Upperlands also has a Hibernian Hall which was built in 1907 and also a Protestant Hall which was used by the local Orange Lodge which was called Upperlands Purple Marksmen LOL 817. It was founded around 1900 by Nathaniel McCoord, and had many notable members throughout its history including Henry Clark who was the MP for North Antrim (he would later resign after marrying a Roman Catholic), Alfred E. Lee who became a Deputy Grand Master (who would in the 1960s transfer from this lodge) among others. Upperlands lodge had been in a steady decline since the early 1980s and became notable for the high number of resignations and transfer requests (men asking to join another lodge) and had at one point, according to official reports, more transfers and resignations that ever other lodge in their district combined. However, there is still a strong Orange presence in the village with a large number of local men belonging to Culnady, Maghera and Timaconavey Orange Lodges. The Apprentice Boys of Derry, Upperlands branch, Murray club used to be one of the largest clubs on parade at the Londonderry celebrations but now has a steady membership of around 30 or so men. They also use the Protestant hall for meetings as do the local Royal Black Preceptory which has ceased to exist since 2006, with Culnady Knights of King Solomon Royal Black Preceptory 1002 now being seen as the local encampment. Upperlands had a Lambeg drumming club at the start of the 20th century and a renowned pipe band in the 1930s but this was later replaced with a number of flute bands which have since died out.  Education  Primary education is provided by Ampertaine Primary School that educates around 120 pupils. A 'Short Inspection' by the Education and Training Inspectorate in September 2009 described the overall quality of the teaching as \\"good or very good\\" and arrangements for pastoral care in the school as \\"very good\\". In February 2014 the school adopted Aston Villa F.C., who play in the school colours of claret and blue, as the focus of an educational initiative. The school was recognised as the Top Performing Northern Ireland primary school for use of the international Accelerated Reader resource at a Renaissance Learning Awards ceremony in London, October 2016. Sport Upperlands Football Club was founded in 1910 they played under several different names until the 1950s. These were the golden years for the club. They play in the Premier Division of the Coleraine & District League briefly stop playing in 2015 before returning rejuvenated in 2019. The young Aces are back in the Coleraine & District League in 2019 to the delight of the local community. Their home ground is Festival Park, and the club most recently won the Constitution Cup 2009/10. The senior team partake in the Coleraine and District League which is affiliated to the Irish Football Association. They hope to start the Swifts team and Old Mill Youth Academy in the near future.

Originally known as the Porta Appia, the gate sat astride the Appian Way, the regina viarum (queen of the roads), which originated at the Porta Capena in the Servian Wall. During the Middle Ages probably it was also called Accia (or Dazza or Datia), a name whose etymology is quite uncertain, but arguably associated with the river Almone, called \\"acqua Accia\\", that flowed nearby. A document ca. AD 1434 calls it Porta Domine quo vadis. The present name is attested only since the second half of 15th century, due to the vicinity to the Basilica of San Sebastiano and its catacombs. The original structure was constructed by Aurelian ca. AD 275 and included a double-arched opening surmounted by bow windows and two semi-cylindrical towers. The fa√ßade was faced with travertine. After a later restoration, the towers were enlarged, increased, and linked, through two parallel walls, to the preexisting Arch of Drusus. In AD 401-402 Emperor Honorius reshaped the gate with a single fornix and a higher attic with two rows of six bow windows each; it was also provided with an uncovered chemin de ronde with merlons. The bases of the towers were incorporated within two square-plan platforms, faced with marble. A later modification yielded the gate's present form, in which a floor has been added to the whole structure, towers included. Due to the absence of the usual plate commemorating the works, some archaeologists doubt that the work has not been carried out by Honorius, who left panegyric epigraphs on any other restored part of the walls or the gates. The latch was released by means of two wooden gates and a shutter that rolled, through still visible grooves, from the control room placed above, whose supporting travertine shelves are still existing. Some notches on the jambs could indicate that wooden beams were also employed to strengthen the latch. Because of the importance of the Appian Way, that just here entered the town, the whole area was concerned with great traffic movements, especially during ancient Rome. It seems that close to the door there was an area designed for parking of the private means of transport (belonging to high rank personalities which could afford it) that accessed the town from here; it was what now could be defined a \\"park and ride\\", since the transit of private means within the town was usually not allowed. This rule probably was effective also for the members of the Imperial family, whose private means were parked in a reserved area (called ‚ÄùMutatorium Caesaris‚Äù) just a little farther at the beginning of the Appian Way. Some lumps, still visible on the travertine upholstery in the basis of the monument, are quite interesting: they could be reference marks for the stone cutters. According to historian Antonio Nibby, in the centre of the arch of the hate, on the inner side, there is a carved Greek cross inscribed into a circumference, with an inscription in Greek, dedicated to Saint Conon and Saint George, dating back to 6th-7th century, but today there is no visible trace left. Archangel Michael and the Medieval inscription On the right jamb of the gate there is also a carved figure portraying Archangel Michael killing a drake, alongside of a blackletter inscription written in Medieval Latin, that commemorates the battle fought on 29 September 1327 (the day of Saint Michael) by Roman Ghibelline militiamen of the Colonnas, led by Giacomo de‚Äô Pontani (or Ponziano), against the Guelph army of Robert of Anjou, King of Naples, led by John II and Gaetano Orsini: ANNO DNI MC‚Ä¶ XVII INDICTIONE XI MENSE SEPTEM BRIS DIE PENULTIM A IN FESTO SCI MICHA ELIS INTRAVIT GENS FORASTERA MURI A ET FUIT DEBELLA TA A POPULO ROMA NO QUI STANTE IA COBO DE PONTIA NIS CAPITE REG IONIS In addition to such remains, that are interesting from an historic viewpoint, the whole monument is noteworthy also for the abundance of graffiti traces that, though not official at all, provide evidence of the daily life that occurred around the gate along the centuries. On the left jamb, in front of Archangel Michael, there are several crosses and a christogram (JHS with a cross above the H), probably carved by pilgrims; there are also several Italian and foreign names (a man by the name of Giuseppe Albani wrote his name three times) and dates, that can be deciphered back to 1622; somebody also carved a kind of road direction to Porta San Giovanni or St. John Lateran, addressed to foreign wanderers and still visible just outside the gate, on the left: ‚ÄúDI QUA SI VA A S. GIO‚Ä¶‚Äù (Italian for \\"Hither you go to S. Jo...\\"), interrupted by something or someone; as well as other signs and writing hard to decipher, such as the engraving ‚ÄúLXXV (underlined three times) DE L‚Äù, on the tower on the right. On 5 April 1536, on the occasion of the entry in Rome of Emperor Charles V, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger changed the gate into a real triumphal arch, decorating it with statues, columns and friezes, as well as arranging - through the demolition of former buildings - a triumphal way up to the Roman Forum. The event is commemorated by an inscription above the arch, which - using an adulation maybe a bit excessive - compares Charles to Scipio: ‚ÄúCARLO V ROM. IMP. AUG. III. AFRICANO‚Äù. On 4 December 1571, the triumphal procession in honor of Marcantonio Colonna, the winner of the battle of Lepanto, also passed through the gate. The feature of that procession that mostly raised curiosity and interest certainly was the parade of the one hundred and seventy chained Turkish prisoners. On that occasion Pasquino, the famous Roman talking statue, expressed its opinion, but this time without talking: it was primped with the blooding head of a Turk and a sword. Since the 5th century, and at least until the 15th, the farming out or the sell of town gates and of the toll collection for their transit to private citizens is attested as a usual practice. A document dating back to 1467Archived within the Vatican Archives and quoted (document nr. XXXVII) by S. Malatesta in ‚ÄúStatuti delle gabelle di Roma‚Äù, Rome, 1886 reports an announcement specifying the modalities for the auction sale of the town gates for the period of a year. Another document dated 1474From the toll register for the year 1474. states that the tender price for both Porta Latina and Porta Appia was ‚Äù39 florins, 31 solidi, 4 dinars for sextaria‚Äù (‚Äúbiannual payment‚Äù); the price was not so high, so the urban traffic through the two gate probably was not excessive as well, though sufficient to guarantee a congruous profit to the purchaser. The profit itself was regulated by detailed tables specifying the charge for each kind of goods,See document nr. XXXVI quoted by S. Malatesta, op. cit. but arguably was rounded off through various kinds of abuses, judging from the number of decrees and threats being issued. Alongside of the west tower there are remains of a walled-in postern, placed above the ground level, whose peculiarity is the absence of traces of wear on the jambs, just as if it was locked soon after it was built. As regards the interior, the most relevant changes are recent and date back to 1942-1943, when the whole structure was occupied and used by Ettore Muti, then the Secretary of the Fascist Party. The white-and-black bicromatic mosaics, still visible in some rooms, were realized in those years. Currently the towers house the Museum of the Walls, that exhibits, among other things, models of the walls and the gates during different phases of their building.

It was first aired on September 30, 1998. Sisko has gone on leave back to Earth to spend time with his father Joseph (played by Brock Peters) and Jake, while wartime life continues aboard Deep Space Nine. Kira is in charge of the station and must work with the Federation and Romulans as part of the war effort, while Worf, O'Brien, Bashir, and Quark cope with the loss of their co-worker Jadzia Dax. There are several guest stars in this episode, including James Darren who returns as Vic Fontaine, Barry Jenner as Starfleet Admiral Ross, J. G. Hertzler as Klingon General Martok, and Megan Cole as the Romulan, Cretak. Plot The episode continues the story that began in the finale of the sixth season, \\"Tears of the Prophets.\\" Benjamin Sisko has taken extended leave on Earth; Kira Nerys, who has been promoted to the rank of Colonel, is in charge of Deep Space Nine; and Worf is still grieving for Jadzia. While Sisko deals with his feelings of failure by visiting his father in New Orleans, Kira and Odo deal with life as normal on the station. The Defiant continues its assignment escorting cargo runs, but Nog, O'Brien, and Bashir all notice that something is bothering Worf, beyond Jadzia's untimely demise at the hand of Gul Dukat. Kira is later called to a meeting with Admiral Ross, who compliments her on the running of the station since Sisko's departure. \\"I'm just keeping his seat warm,\\" she reminds the Admiral, even though he himself is not sure when the Captain will return. He then informs Kira that the Romulan Empire has been given permission to send a permanent delegation to the station, just as the Klingons have. The leader is one Senator Cretak, who is a staunch supporter of the Alliance between Romulus and the Federation, but Kira is not thrilled at this news. Ross ignores her dubious feelings, reminding her that he came as a courtesy, \\"this decision has already been made\\". Back on Earth, a distant Sisko separates himself from his family, doing nothing but playing the piano in the restaurant his father Joseph owns. His son, Jake, is worried about his father's attitude, though Joseph realizes it will take time. As they talk, Sisko continues playing, until his baseball rolls off the top of the piano and hits the floor. Sisko, stopping his playing, reaches for the ball, and is suddenly pulled into one of the visions that he has been sent in the past by the Bajoran Prophets. In it, he sees himself in the desert on an alien world that he knows to be Tyree. He is digging frantically, before coming across a blanket buried in the sand. Slowly he pulls at it, only to reveal the hidden face of a woman whom he does not recognize. Joseph eventually reveals that the face belongs to Sisko's biological mother Sarah, who abandoned the family when Sisko was a year old and who later died. Joseph also gives Sisko a necklace of Sarah's, which has ancient Bajoran writing on it. Later, a Bajoran member of a Pah-Wraith cult led by Gul Dukat (see DS9 episode Covenant) attacks Sisko and attempts to kill him to prevent him from finding the Orb of the Emissary on Tyree but Jake knocks him out. Back on the station, Senator Cretak asks Kira to petition the Bajoran Council of Ministers to allow the Romulans to set up a hospital on the uninhabited moon of Derna. Kira does so and they accept. Later, Odo tells Kira that a Starfleet transport filled with wounded, most of which were Vulcans, was denied permission to dock at the hospital. At first, Kira doesn't think it's suspicious because of the two species' mutual distrust, until Odo shows her sensor readings that indicate the presence of plasma torpedoes. Kira then furiously tells Cretak to have the weapons removed immediately, but the Senator refuses. Meanwhile, Worf confides in O'Brien that he is worried Jadzia won't enter Klingon heaven, Sto'Vo'Kor, because she didn't die in battle and the only way to ensure her place in Sto'Vo'Kor is by winning a glorious battle in her name. General Martok tells Worf he needs a first officer for a very dangerous mission that will ensure Jadzia's place in Sto'Vo'Kor. At the end of the episode, a young female Starfleet ensign, a Trill, enters and greets Sisko, who does not recognize her. She then introduces herself as \\"Dax\\". Reception It received Nielsen ratings of 4.4 points, equating to 4.4 million viewers when it was first broadcast on syndicated television in September 1998. The episode has been analyzed to have a theme of destiny, especially for Sisko. In 2015, Geek.com recommended this episode as \\"essential watching\\" for their abbreviated Star Trek: Deep Space Nine binge-watching guide. In 2018, SyFy recommend this episode for its abbreviated watch guide for the Bajoran character Kira Nerys. In 2019, Screen Rant ranked a character introduced in this episode, Kimara Cretak, as the 4th most important Romulan of the Star Trek franchise. Cast This episode briefly introduces Ensign Ezri Dax (portrayed by Nicole de Boer) as the new host for the Dax symbiont. Also, Deborah Lacey is introduced as a mysterious face in the sand, which becomes a plot element in the show and part of the overall story.

The exact origins of the Arch are unclear. It is now generally agreed that it has nothing to do with Nero Claudius Drusus, the conqueror of the Germans. Some versions have the arch being constructed as part of a spur added to the Aqua Marcia by Caracalla in 211‚Äì216 AD to take water from that aqueduct to Caracalla's new baths. However, it appears more likely that the arch pre-dated the aqueduct and that the aqueduct was conveniently routed over the top of the arch. Only the central part of this arch is now standing, but it was originally triple, or at least with projections on each side, although never finished. It is built of travertine, faced with marble, and on each side of the archway are columns of Numidian marble with white marble bases. The archway is 7.21 metres high. The Aqua Antoniniana, the branch of the Aqua Marcia, ran over this arch, but the brick-faced concrete that is visible on the top seems to belong to a later period.

It was located on the southeast ridge, halfway between the \\"South Summit\\" and the true summit, and it gave climbers the last real challenge before reaching the top of the mountain via the southeast route. The Step was known as the most technically difficult part of the typical Nepal-side Everest climb. In some climbing seasons after heavy snowfall, the rock face could have been bypassed with snow/ice climbing. Climbing the Hillary Step has the danger of a drop on the right (when going up) and an drop on the left.Scientific American - Because It‚Äôs Not There: Climbers May Face Danger If Everest‚Äôs Hillary Step Collapsed (May 25, 2017) The Hillary Step was where the late Anatoli Boukreev found a body hanging from ropes at the base of the step in 1996, as stated in his book The Climb. One expedition noted that climbing the Hillary Step was \\"strenuous\\", but did offer some protection from the elements. An unaided Hillary Step climb was rated as a Class 4 rock climb, but at almost altitude. The Hillary Step was destroyed by an earthquake that struck the region in 2015.  History  The Step was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first known person, along with Tenzing Norgay, to scale it on the way to the summit during the 1953 British Mount Everest Expedition. Hillary and Tenzing first climbed the Hillary Step on 29 May 1953 by climbing the crack between the snow and the rock. Hillary reported that the snow on the step was harder than at lower elevation. Hillary wrote in 1953 (the reference to Tenzing being hauled up like a fish rankled with Tenzing, and the \\"fish\\" simile disappeared from later accounts): The Summit (Chapter 16, pp 197-209) is by Hillary. :After an hour‚Äôs steady going we reached the foot of the most formidable- looking problem on the ridge ‚Äì a rock step some forty feet [12m] high. We had known of the existence of this step from aerial photographs, and had also seen it through our binoculars from Thyangboche. We realised that at this altitude it might well spell the difference between success and failure. The rock itself, smooth and almost holdless, might have been an interesting Sunday afternoon problem for a group of expert rock climbers in the Lake District, but here it was a barrier beyond our feeble strength to overcome. I could see no way of turning it on the steep rock bluff on the west, but fortunately another possibility of tackling it still remained. On its east side was another great cornice, and running up the full forty feet of the step was a narrow crack between the cornice and the rock. Leaving Tenzing to belay me as best he could, I jammed my way into this crack, then kicking backwards with my crampons I sank their spikes deep into the frozen snow behind me and levered myself off the ground. Taking advantage of every little rock hold and all the force of knee, shoulder and arms I could muster, I literally cramponed backwards up the crack, with a fervent prayer that the cornice would remain attached to the rock. Despite the considerable effort involved, my progress although slow was steady, and as Tenzing paid out the rope I inched my way upwards until I could finally reach over the top of the rock and drag myself out of the crack on to a wide ledge. For a few moments I lay regaining my breath and for the first time really felt the fierce determination that nothing now could stop us from reaching the top. I took a firm stand on the ledge and signalled to Tenzing to come on up. As I heaved hard on the rope Tenzing wriggled his way up the crack and finally collapsed exhausted at the top like a giant fish when it has just been hauled from the sea after a terrific struggle. The step had been seen by the first assault party of Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans when they reached the South Summit on 26 May 1953 at 1 pm (too late to attempt the summit). Seated on the snow dome, they could look closely at the last 300 vertical feet [90m] to the Summit. It was not the gentle snow ridge they‚Äôd hoped for ... but a thin crest of snow and ice on rock, steep on the left, overhanging as a cornice on the right. It was interrupted by a formidable-looking 40 foot [12m] rock step two-thirds of the way up.  Modern climbing  In more recent years, the ascent and descent over the Step were generally made with the assistance of fixed ropes, usually placed there by the first ascending team of the season. With increasing numbers of people climbing the mountain, the Step frequently become a bottleneck, with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes, leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently up and down the mountain. Only one climber at a time could traverse it. In a good climbing situation (prior to the potential collapse of the step), it was about a two-hour climb from the South Summit to the Hillary Step, one to two hours to climb the cliff, and then another 20 minutes from the top of the Hillary Step to the summit of Mount Everest. It was suspected in 2016 that the April 2015 Nepal earthquake had altered the Hillary Step, but there was so much snow it was not clear whether it had truly changed.'I honestly couldn't recognise it' ‚Äì the Hillary Step has changed. Stuff August 19, 2016. Retrieved 20 August 2016. Kenton Cool wrote that the Hillary Step \\"is only 12 to 15 feet [3.7 to 4.6m] high.\\" It was reported in May 2017 by climbers including mountaineer Tim Mosedale that \\"the Hillary Step is no more\\", although the full extent and interpretation of the changes were still nascent. Another climber who thought the Step changed by 2016 was six-time Everest summiter David Lia√±o Gonzalez, who summited in 2013 and 2016, when the relevant changes are reported to have occurred. However, some important Nepalese climbers, including Ang Tshering Sherpa, chairman of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, reported that the Step was still intact but covered in more snow than before. Later in the year, after seeing a large exhibition of photos from 2006 to 2016 he did agree that at least the upper portion of the step had indeed changed.Rangdu‚Äôs photo exhibit reveals truth about Hillary Step Peter Hillary, Edmund Hillary's son, was asked his opinion about the Step based on photos. He agreed it was there in part, but seemed to think it had undergone some sort of a change, noting especially what looked like a fresh broken rock. By early June 2017 more reports and photographic evidence came in, with Garrett Madison reporting that the step had conclusively changed. Dave Hahn, who has climbed Everest 15 times, was shown photos and agreed that it was changed. A special kind of mourning hit the community with realization of missing rocks and freshly hewn scars of new coloured rock at this landmark feature. Hahn noted how it was great tribute to Hillary and Tenzing and he thought of them whenever he scrambled over it. Later in 2017, mountaineering guide Lhakpa Rangdu did a photo exhibition at the Nepal Tourism Board showing how the Hillary Step area had changed in the relevant years. Rangdu has climbed Everest multiple times since 2005, including before and after the big Nepal earthquake, and he is a trained photographer. The combination of these skills‚Äîhigh-altitude photography and mountaineering‚Äîallowed him to provide a photographic history of the Hillary step feature, and he has stated that it is indeed gone, crumbled by the Ghorka earthquake that devastated Nepal and Chinese Tibet.

The book was written in 1989, and is a critical account of the business, social, and political structure of Japan. The title of the book addresses the mystery and awe that many Americans and Europeans had toward the impressive Japanese business achievements at that time. Upon publication the book was greeted with criticism in Japan, but has come to be regarded as one of the most important business books about Japan in the west. As a result, the book is frequently referenced by other textbooks. Synopsis At over 500 pages long, the book is quite dense. By dividing the book into consistent sections, the author has allowed readers to digest it in sections. Of these, sections dealing with education, the elusive Japanese state, the all-pervasive bureaucracy, the middle class, ritual in society, and the press are regarded as the most important. Overall, Van Wolferen creates an image of a state where a complicated political-corporate relationship retards progress, and where the citizens forgo the social rights enjoyed in other developed countries out of a collective fear of foreign domination. Van Wolferen defines this image across various aspects of Japanese culture, and chronicles its origin through the history of the nation. He frequently cites examples, giving the book 57 pages of endnotes. Throughout, the author points out inefficiencies in the system, and compares it unfavorably to the standard Western system. Van Wolferen states examples that demonstrate the nature of power in Japan and how it is wielded. Japanese power is described as being held by a loose group of unaccountable elites who operate behind the scenes. Because this power is loosely held, those who wield it escape responsibility for the consequences when things go wrong as there is no one who can be held accountable. In particular, the author criticizes large Japanese businesses, and the Liberal Democratic Party, which he describes as being neither liberal nor democratic. Criticism Upon publication, both the book and the author received harsh criticism. Some regard the book as resorting to a stereotypical view of the Japanese, casting them as weak-minded people neglecting to change their country for the better out of fear. While it is true that the book sometimes harshly criticizes Japanese society, the author also praises many aspects of it, including work ethic, low crime rate, thrift, and respect for elders. The criticism in Japan focused on the fact that Van Wolferen cannot read or write Japanese, and is not even fluent in spoken Japanese after living in Japan for decades. Others criticize some of the references Van Wolferen uses, accusing them of being out of date or irrelevant. Bungeishunj≈´, a Japanese monthly magazine, stated that it is indeed incredible that a book written by a high school graduate who cannot read or write Japanese is taken as a serious commentary about Japan. The Asahi Shimbun called the publication ‚ÄúAn elaborate and persuasive study, sharply and carefully analyzing a multitude of aspects of Japanese reality.‚Äù The Ch≈´≈çk≈çron claimed: ‚ÄúAny serious Japanese intellectual reading this book will be struck as if by lightning.‚Äù Other Japanese argue that the book ought to be credited as a valid work of journalism for synthesizing existing critiques of Japan written by accepted and Japanese-literate Western academics whose works may not be accessible to the masses. Reception Today the book is still regarded as controversial both in and out of Japan. Soon after the book was published, the Japanese asset price bubble burst, and the book gained credibility as commentators searched to explain it. Overall the western reception has been more positive than in Japan, and it, or sections of it, are frequently studied by Japanese and business students attempting to gain a better understanding of the nation.

Herbert was the son of Aubrey Herbert, Member of Parliament (MP), who died the year after his birth, and brother-in-law of the famous novelist, Evelyn Waugh. He was named after his great-uncle, the Voluntarist philosopher, and in a gesture of familial reconciliation, the Waughs named their son after him. Herbert attended Ampleforth College from 1934 to 1940 and Balliol College, Oxford from 1940 to 1942. After the Second World War broke out he made repeated attempts to serve, but was rejected by the British Army, the Free French and the Dutch forces in Britain. He was finally accepted by the Polish Army in Britain. He fought throughout the Normandy Campaign. In 1944, while he was on a personal mission from Winston Churchill in Belgium, he was arrested by Canadian military police in a bar in Ghent, on suspicion of being a spy. His eccentric appearance and manner, and his proficiency at languages, had aroused their suspicion. He was badly beaten and received lasting facial scars. After the war Herbert was unsuccessful in his attempts to enter Parliament. He supported various Eastern European anti- Communist groups, helped to resettle Polish refugees and financed a textile mill to employ Polish exiles. His assistance extended to Ukrainian and Belarusian groups. He was a founder and chairman of the Anglo-Belarusian Society and a parishioner of the Belarusian Eastern Rite Catholic Church in Finchley. http://belarusjournal.com/sites/default/files/JBS_1974_6_Auberon%20Herbert%20%281922-1974%29.pdf He authored several reports on the Anglo-Belarusian Society activities between 1965 and 1971. http://belarusjournal.com/author/auberon-herbert A recently released CIA document names a \\"Mr. Herbert AUBERON of 11 Neville Terrace, London, SW 7\\" as one of two representatives of the British Conservative Party who met the Ukrainian nationalist leader Yaroslav Stetsko in early 1951. Herbert opposed Evelyn Waugh's marriage to his sister Laura Herbert, and Waugh never forgave him. An unflattering portrayal of a brother-in-law, \\"Boy\\" Mulcaster, featuring some of Herbert's characteristics appears in Waugh's novel Brideshead Revisited.http://www.doubtinghall.co.uk/ Despite high intelligence and a circle of distinguished friends (including Isaiah Berlin and Malcolm Muggeridge), Herbert seemed unable to accomplish as much in his life as he hoped. Being the only son, he inherited the family's country home of Pixton Park, near Dulverton in Somerset and the Villa Alta Chiara (an Italian rendering of \\"Highclere\\", the English seat of the Earls of Carnarvon) at Portofino in Italy, built by his grandfather the 4th Earl, which features in Waugh's Sword of Honour trilogy. Herbert died a bachelor at the age of 52. His estate was probated at (GB)¬£895,722.

It is situated approximately 30 km northeast of Diepholz, and 30 km southwest of Bremen. The source of the Delme river is located in the city. The most important attraction in Twistringen is the museum of straw processing. History Twistringen was first mentioned in a document in 1250 as \\"Thuisteringe\\". In this writing all towns, which had to pay early contributions for the maintenance of the bridge over the Weser in Bremen. There was a parish in the city since approximately 825. After the Reformation in 1525, the parish Twistring was re-Catholicized in 1618. Located in a predominantly Protestant area, Twistringen was a Catholic enclave of the Prince-Bishopric of M√ºnster. It has been a part of the Diocese Osnabr√ºck since 1824. Today, Twistringen is still mainly Catholic. Under French rule from 1811 to 1813, a modern road connection, the Napoleon Road (now called B 51) was built in Twistringen. In 1817, it became part of the Kingdom of Hanover. Only after the construction of the rail connection between Bremen and Osnabr√ºck in 1873, did Lutherans settle in the town again. These founded a Protestant- Lutheran congregation in 1891 and inaugurated their own church in 1894. There was also a small Jewish community in Twistringen. Until 1938, there was a synagogue, which is still commemorated by a plaque. Somewhat outside of the center of Twistringen, there is still a Jewish cemetery. In 1964, Twistringen gained town privileges. In 1974, the Municipality Twistringen was created with the incorporation of the localities of Abbenhausen, Altenmarhorst, Heiligenloh, M√∂rsen, Natenstedt, R√ºssen, Scharrendorf, Stelle and Twistringen. Importance of straw processing Hay processing has played an important role in Twistringen for centuries. At times, one third of all inhabitants were somehow employed in this industry. Straw hats, drinking straws, etc. were produced in Twistringen and exported into many countries. The museum of straw processing documents the history and development of this industry from its beginning to the present. Largest straw hat in the world To celebrate the 750th anniversary of the town in 2000, a giant straw hat, which made it into the Guinness Book of World Records was constructed in front of the town hall. It had a diameter of 5.50 meters. The celebration was also visited by Reinhold Beckmann, a well-known television host, who hails from Twistringen. Now the hat can be found in the museum. Early medieval ring wall A castle called H√ºnenburg is situated in the borough St√∂ttinghausen. Only a ring wall with a diameter of 80 meters is still visible. It is the remains of a fortress, from the 5th to 9th century. An examination of the interior of the wall in 1932 turned out that several buildings had once existed here. In 2005, the wooden entrance gate was reconstructed to give the structure a look, reminding visitors of a castle. Geological finds As far as geology, Twistringen has gained supra-regional relevance. Until the 1990s, mudstone was exhausted in the mine of the brickyard in the outskirts of town. These are sediments of the North Sea, which were deposed in the region during the Miocene period. In the mudstones a fauna very rich in both species and organisms was found. They contained a lot of snails, clams, scaphopods, and corals, but also more rarely sea urchins, vertebrate skeletons and teeth, and rests of cephalopods. The fauna was generally small and unspectacular. However, because of the diversity of species - at least 250 species of snails from the strata of Twistringen are known and described -, thus a picture of the animal world of this time period so exact is gained, that Twistringen has become one of the \\"classical place of discovery of paleontology\\". Finds from Twistringen are in numerous museums and private collections.  Airplane disaster of 1973  On November 13, 1973 a Belgian F-104 Starfighter crashed into a home in the borough of M√∂rsen. The pilot, a fireman, the father, the mother, and two girls died. A young boy was able to escape out of a hatch before the fire spread to the home. The disaster left three young orphans. International relations Since 1977, Twistringen has been partnered with the French municipality Bonn√©table, which is situated in the department of Sarthe. In Bonn√©table, there is a street called \\"Rue de Twistringen\\". Since 2011 there is also a partnership with the lithuanian city Kai≈°iadorys which has 10.000 inhabitants and is part of the Kaunas area. Politics The city council has 26 seats plus that of the mayor. Since the communal elections of September 11, 2011, the seat distribution is as follows: *CDU 15 seats *SPD 5seats *Greens 4 seats *FDP 2 seats Transportation Twistringen is on the railway line Bremen-Osnabr√ºck. There is a train to Bremen every half-hour and to Osnabr√ºck every hour. The B51, a federal road which runs from Bremen to Osnabr√ºck, runs through the center of Twistringen. Driving to Bremen takes about 45 minutes, to Osnabr√ºck 70 minutes. Twistringen is 36 km away from Bremen Airport. Schools and educational institutions In Twistringen, there are 2 elementary schools and a school center, where a Hauptschule, a Realschule, a Gymnasium, the Hildegard-von-Bingen-Gymnasium Twistringen, and a municipal library are located. There are also several kindergartens.

It commences at the side of the root of the nose and is a direct continuation of the angular vein where it also receives a small nasal branch. It lies behind the facial artery and follows a less tortuous course. It receives blood from the external palatine vein before it either joins the anterior branch of the retromandibular vein to form the common facial vein, or drains directly into the internal jugular vein. A common misconception states that the facial vein has no valves, but this has been contradicted by recent studies. Its walls are not so flaccid as most superficial veins. Path From its origin it runs obliquely downward and backward, beneath the zygomaticus major muscle and zygomatic head of the quadratus labii superioris, descends along the anterior border and then on the superficial surface of the masseter, crosses over the body of the mandible, and passes obliquely backward, beneath the platysma and cervical fascia, superficial to the submandibular gland, the digastricus and stylohyoideus muscles. Clinical significance Thrombophlebitis of the facial vein, (inflammation of the facial vein with secondary clot formation) can result in pieces of an infected clot extending into the cavernous sinus, forming thrombophlebitis of the cavernous sinus.

In contrast, in 1926 the two populations were nearly balanced at around one-third each, with Russians, Armenians and Greeks constituting the remainder. Large-scale immigration of Georgians, Russians and Armenians allowed their respective populations to balloon; while the Abkhaz population had not even doubled by 1989, the Georgian population had nearly quadrupled from 67,494 to 239,872, the Armenian population had tripled and the Russian population had sextupled.Population censuses in Abkhazia: 1886, 1926, 1939, 1959, 1970, 1979, 1989, 2003 Military conflict in Abkhazia In 1992, the political situation in Abkhazia changed into a military confrontation between the Georgian government and Abkhaz separatists. The fighting escalated as Georgian Interior and Defence Ministry forces along with police units took Sukhumi and came near the city of Gudauta. The ethnically based policies initiated by the Georgians in Sukhumi created simultaneously refugees and a core of fighters determined to regain lost homes.Human Rights Watch report. Georgia/Abkhazia: Violations of the Laws of War and Russia's Role in the Conflict, page 23. Published in March, 1995 However, as the war progressed, the Abkhaz separatist have carried out same policies of violent displacement of ethnic Georgians from their homes in greater proportions which has left 250,000 people being forcefully evicted from their homes. Under the alleged aid from Russia, they managed to re-arm and organize \\"volunteer battalions\\" from North Caucasus. According to political analyst Georgy Mirsky, the Russian military base in Gudauta was, \\"supplying the Abkhazian side with weapons and ammunition.\\" Georgiy Mirsky.

Conflict in the Caucasus: Georgia, Abkhazia, and the Russian Shadow., p 10 Roughly 200,000 to 250,000 ethnic Georgians were expelled from their homes. The campaign ethnic cleansing also included Russians, Armenians, Greeks, moderate Abkhaz and other minor ethnic groups living in Abkhazia. More than 20,000 houses owned by ethnic Georgians were destroyed. Hundreds of schools, kindergartens, churches, hospitals, historical monuments were pillaged and destroyed. The 1994 U.S. State Department Country Reports describes scenes of massive human rights abuse, also supported by Human Rights Watch based on their own findings. According to U.S. State Department Country Report on Conflict in Abkhazia (Georgia): After the end of the war, the government of Georgia, the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the refugees began to investigate and gather facts about the allegations of genocide, ethnic cleansing and deportation which was conducted by the Abkhaz side during the conflict. In 1994 and again in 1996 the OSCE during the Budapest summit gave its official recognition of ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia and condemned the \\"perpetrators of war crimes committed during the conflict.\\"From the Resolution of the OSCE Budapest Summit, December 6, 1994 In March 2006, the Hague War Crimes Tribunal announced that it had reviewed all the documents submitted by the Georgian side. After a full-scale investigation, the Tribunal concluded that it would prosecute and start hearings against the campaign of ethnic cleansing, war-crimes and terror inflicted on ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia.The conflict in Abkhazia: dilemmas in Russian 'peacekeeping' policy, Lynch, Dov, pp 36‚Äì37Challenges to peacebuilding : managing spoilers during conflict resolution Newman Edward, p 282 According to Catherine Dale from United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees: On June 18, 2001, Russian President Vladimir Putin, while on summit in Ljubljiana, Slovenia, confirmed the fact of the atrocity, remarking that, \\"Georgian authorities seem to have forgotten how Chechen terrorists used the heads of Georgians as footballs during the Abkhazian crisis. Yes, unfortunately, that is a fact.\\"  Ethnic cleansing (1992‚Äì1993) The Human Rights Watch report which was drafted in 1995 and included detailed account of the war crimes and atrocities committed during the war concludes that, \\"Human Rights Watch finds Abkhaz forces responsible for the foreseeable wave of revenge, human rights abuse, and war crimes that was unleashed on the Georgian population in Sukhumi and other parts of Abkhazia. In Human Rights Watch's judgment, these practices were indeed encouraged in order to drive the Georgian population from its homes.\\"March 1995, GEORGIA/ABKHAZIA: VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS OF WAR AND RUSSIA'S ROLE IN THE CONFLICT Following are few examples taken from the Helsinki Human Rights Watch Reports and documentation submitted for the review to United Nations and Hague War Crimes Tribunal. Fall of Gagra On September 3, 1992, the Russian mediated agreement was signed between Georgian and Abkhaz separatist sides which obliged Georgia to withdraw its military forces from the city of Gagra. The agreement forced Abkhaz separatists from Gudauta to hold their attacks on the city. Soon after, the Georgian forces which included Shavnabada, Avaza and White Eagle battalions (along with their tanks and heavy artillery) left the city. Only small pockets of armed groups (made up of volunteers units of the ethnic Georgians of Gagra) remained. However, on October 1, the Abkhaz side violated the agreement and launched a full-scale attack on Gagra. The attack was well coordinated and mainly carried out by the Chechen (under the command of Shamil Basaev) and North Caucasian militants. Meantime in Gagra, Georgian small detachments lost the control of the city suburbs (Leselidze and Kolkhida) and eventually were destroyed in the city center by the end of October 1. With the fall of the city, the Georgian population of Gagra was captured by the separatists and their allies. The first major massacres and ethnic-cleansing were committed during the fall of Gagra.Human Rights Watch Report, First draft made in December 1993 and submitted to Helsinki office. People of all ages were rounded up from Gagra, Leselidze, Kolkhida and killed. When the separatist militants entered the city, civilians became a target of mass murder. The main targets were young people and children. According to the witness account: :\\"When I returned home I was surprised to see a lot of armed people on the street. They were quiet. I mistook one of them for my Georgian neighbour, and I said, \\"How are you?\\" in Georgian. He grabbed me by the wrist and said, \\"Keep quiet.\\" I wasn't afraid for myself; I thought they had killed my family. He asked me in Russian, \\"Where are your young people? We won't kill you, we'll kill them.\\" I said they weren't here, that there were only old people left.\\"Human Rights Watch report. Georgia/Abkhazia: Violations of the Laws of War and Russia's Role in the Conflict, page 26. Published in March, 1995 Women and young girls captured by the militants became the victims of rape and torture. One elderly Georgian woman who lived through the October attack in Gagra recounted the following: \\"They brought over a blind man and his brother, who always stayed with him. They began to beat the blind man, his brother and his wife with a gun butt, calling him \\"dog!\\" and kicking him. He fell over. I saw blood. One soldier said: \\"We won't kill you, but where are the young girls?\\" I said there weren't any.\\"Human Rights Watch report. Georgia/Abkhazia: Violations of the Laws of War and Russia's Role in the Conflict, page 27. Published in March, 1995 After the fall of Gagra, the victors started to pillage, rape, and torture followed by summary executions of everyone who was captured and failed to flee the city in time. At 5:00 pm on October 1, civilians (approximately 1000‚Äì1500 people) were rounded up and placed under the guard at the soccer stadium in downtown Gagra. On October 6, close to 50 civilians had been found hanging on electricity poles. Soon after, children, elderly, women and men who were detained on the soccer stadium were gunned down and dumped in mass graves not far from the stadium. A Russian military observer Mikhail Demianov (who was accused by the Georgian side of being the military advisor to the separatist leader Ardzinba) told Human Rights Watch: UN observers started to investigate and gather all the facts concerning the war crimes during the fall of Gagra. Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council of Abkhazia Mikhail Jinjaradze was dragged out from his office and executed.Conspiracy Against Georgia by Tamaz Nadareishvili, Merani Publishing, Tbilisi 2002, page 93 Massacre in Kamani After the failed attempt of the separatist forces and their allies to storm Sukhumi on March 14, 1993, Abkhaz diverted their main forces to the northern side of the front line which divided Georgian held Sukhumi and separatist controlled territories. On July 4, the Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus militia, Abkhaz formations, and Armenian Bagramyan battalion transported by allegedly Russian naval forces to the city of Tkhvarcheli began their offensive on the northern Sukhumi district. Georgian forces and local volunteer units (including Ukrainian nationalist organization members (UNA- UNSO)) stationed in the villages of Shroma, Tamishi and Kamani were taken by surprise. On July 5, after intensive fighting, Georgians lost as many as 500 people in a couple of hours.The Conflict in Abkhazia: Dilemmas in Russian 'Peacekeeping' Policy by Dov Lynch The village of Kamani fell into the hands of separatist formations and their North Caucasian allies. Kamani was populated mainly by Svans (a sub-ethnic group of the Georgian people) and by Orthodox nuns who had been living in the church of St George located in the center of the village.Conflict in the Caucasus: Georgia, Abkhazia, and the Russian Shadow by S. A. Chervonnaia and Svetlana Mikhailovna Chervonnaia, p 51 The local villagers (including women and children) were massacred while the church of St George became the scene of a blood bath. The nuns were raped and killed in front of the orthodox priests, father Yuri Anua and father Andria. Both priests were taken outside of the church and questioned about the ownership of the land in Abkhazia. After answering that Abkhazia was neither Georgian nor Abkhaz land but God's, they were shot by a confederate soldier. Another priest was killed along with father Yuri Anua and father Andria, an ethnic Abkhaz who was forced to shoot father Andria before he was killed.Conflict in the Caucasus: Georgia, Abkhazia, and the Russian Shadow by S. A. Chervonnaia and Svetlana Mikhailovna Chervonnaia, p 52 Approximately, 120 inhabitants of the village were massacred.  Fall of Sukhumi  Thomas Goltz, a war correspondent who visited Abkhazia during the war, recalls that Russian MIG-29s dropped 500 kilograms of vacuum bombs which mainly targeted the residential areas of Sukhumi and villages on Gumista River.Goltz Thomas. Georgia Diary: A Chronicle of War and Political Chaos in the Post-Soviet, p 139 The Russian journalist Dmitry Kholodov remained in Sukhumi before it fell to separatists and wrote a couple of reports from the besieged city, On July 27, 1993, a Russian-brokered trilateral agreement on a cease-fire and principles for the solution of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict was signed. Once again Georgian military started to withdraw all of its heavy artillery, tanks, and a significant number of its troops from Sukhumi. The Abkhaz separatists along with their allies were bound by the agreement to hold their offensive and heavy bombardment of the city. In return, the Georgian side was reassured by Russia that Sukhumi would not be attacked or bombed if Georgian army would complete its withdrawal. The Georgian troops along with their tanks were evacuated by the Russian military ships to the city of Poti. The city was left without any significant military defense. A large number of civilians stayed in Sukhumi and all schools were re-opened on September 1. The large number of IDPs returned to their homes and the normal life resumed in Sukhumi. According to Shevardnadze he trusted Yeltsin and the Russian guarantees and therefore, asked the population to return.Shevardnadze Edward, Thoughts on Past and Future, , p 121 However, the Abkhaz separatists, North Caucasian Volunteers, Cossacks and Russian special forces attacked Sukhumi on September 16 at 8 a.m.Goltz Thomas. Georgia Diary: A Chronicle of War and Political Chaos in the Post-Soviet, p 93 It marked the beginning of 12 days non-stop fighting around the besieged Sukhumi with intensive fighting and human loss from the both sides. Georgians who stayed in the city with only rifles and AK 47s were left without any defense from artillery or mechanized units.Goltz Thomas. Georgia Diary: A Chronicle of War and Political Chaos in the Post- Soviet, p 153 The union of theater actors of Sukhumi joined fighting along with other civilians who decided to fight. The city was mercilessly bombed by Russian air forces and separatist artillery.Goltz Thomas. Georgia Diary: A Chronicle of War and Political Chaos in the Post-Soviet, p 135 On September 27, the city fell as Abkhaz, Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus (CMPC) and Russian units stormed the House of the Government of Abkhazia. One of the most horrific massacres of this war was waged on the civilian population of Sukhumi after its downfall. During the storming of the city, close to 1,000 people perished as Abkhaz formations overran the streets of the city. The civilians who were trapped in the city were taken from their houses, basements and apartment building. In Tamaz Nadareishvili's book, Genocide in Abkhazia, the eye witness interviews of the IDPs includes the following account by the elderly Georgian refugee who survived the war: The separatists and their allies captured the Chairman of the Supreme Council Zhiuli Shartava, the Mayor of Sukhumi Guram Gabiskiria, Mamia Alasania and other members of the Abkhaz government including the members of Sukhumi police. Initially they were promised safety,Zhiuli Shartava memorial page but eventually killed, and the UN report mentions Shartava being excessively tortured.Report of the UN Secretary General on the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia, October 12, 1993 A Georgian woman who survived Sukhumi massacre, recalls her ordeal in an interview with Russian film director Andrei Nekrasov, The massacres continued after the fall of Sukhumi for about two weeks. Georgians who had failed to flee the city had been hiding in abandoned apartment buildings and house basements.

One of the most brutal massacres of the war was committed during this period. Video materials show a 5-year-old child being brutally killed by Abkhaz militant in front of his mother on the streets of Sukhumi. Over 100 Georgian persons working in the cultural field were killed, among them women. Among others, there were Nato Milorava, the artistic director of the Gumista recreation centre, Vasily Cheidze, Teymuraz Zhvaniya, Guram Gelovani - actors of the Drama Theatre, and Yuriy Davitaya, the director of the Sukhumi park of culture and recreation. Also murdered were 200 teachers, including 60 women. Massive reprisals were conducted in the neighbouring regions as well. In Khypsta/Akhalsopeli 17 Georgians were shot, the heart of a man of 70 years was cut out, another man was hacked to death by axe, a 65 year old was tied to a tractor, tortured and then killed. Abkhaz nationals were also targeted during the Sukhumi massacres. Anyone who had tried to hide a Georgian refugee or helped in any way was condemned and killed. \\"Temur Kutarba, an Abhazian, was killed by an Adighe Soldier in front of his children, for not being active in killing Georgians.

Within hours, the men were executed while women and teenagers were raped and later killed.State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993, February 1994 According to witness accounts, Abkhaz separatist organized detention camps where teenage girls and women were kept for 25 days. During this period they were systematically raped and abused.The conflict in Abkhazia: dilemmas in Russian 'peacekeeping' policy, Lynch, Dov, p 34 Besides the atrocities being committed against civilians, more than 50 Georgian prisoners of war were executed. The mass killing of civilians also occurred in other parts of the Ochamchire district, mainly in Kochara (heavily populated by ethnic Georgians, 5340 persons according to pre-war estimates). Approximately 235 civilians were killed and 1000 houses were destroyed.The conflict in Abkhazia: dilemmas in Russian 'peacekeeping' policy, Lynch, Dov, pp 16‚Äì17 The former resident of Ochamchire district, Leila Goletiani, who was taken prisoner by Abkhaz separatists, gave the following account of her captivity to the Russian film director Andrei Nekrasov: Gali After the fall of Sukhumi, the only region in Abkhazia which maintained its large ethnic Georgian population was Gali. The ethnic composition of Gali region differed from the rest of Abkhazia. The region was mainly populated by ethnic Georgians and never experienced any military activity during the war. In the beginning of 1994, Abkhaz separatists, confronted by the reality of the large ethnic Georgian presence within the borders of Abkhazia, continued their policy of ethnic cleansing and forced expulsion of ethnic Georgians.Briefing on Current Situation in Georgia and Implications for U.S. Policy, Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, October 25, 1993 United Nations observers witnessed the events of 1994 as they unfolded.Report of the UN Secretary General on the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia, October 12, 1994 Between February 8 and 13, Abkhaz separatist militia and their allies attacked the villages and populated areas of the Gali region, killing, raping, and destroying houses (approximately 4,200 houses were destroyed as the result).S State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993, February 1994 Despite the presence of Russian CIS peacekeeping forces, the massacres and mass killing of ethnic Georgians was carried out between 1995 and 1996 which resulted in 450 deaths and thousands of IDPs fleeing eastwards. Post-war period 240x240px The legacy of ethnic cleansing in Abkhazia has been devastating for the Georgian society. The war and the subsequent systematic ethnic cleansing produced about 200,000-250,000 of IDPs that fled to various Georgian regions, mostly in Samegrelo (Mingrelia) (112,208; UNHCR, June 2000). In Tbilisi and elsewhere in Georgia refugees occupied hundreds of hotels, dormitories and abandoned Soviet military barracks for temporary residency. Many of them had to leave for other countries, primarily to Russia,30,000 Georgians left Abkhazia for Russia - to search for work. In the early 90s refugees living in Georgia resisted assimilating into Georgian society. Georgia's government did not encourage the assimilation of the refugees fearing that it would \\"lose one of the arguments for retaining hegemony over Abkhazia\\". Some 60,000 Georgian refugees spontaneously returned to Abkhazia's Gali district between 1994 and 1998, but tens of thousands were displaced again when fighting resumed in the Gali district in 1998. Nevertheless, from 40,000 to 60,000 refugees have returned to the Gali district since 1998, including persons commuting daily across the ceasefire line and those migrating seasonally in accordance with agricultural cycles.UN High Commissioner for refugees. Background note on the Protection of Asylum Seekers and Refugees in Georgia remaining outside Georgia, The human rights situation remains precarious in the Georgian- populated areas of the Gali district. The United Nations and other international organizations have been fruitlessly urging the Abkhaz de facto authorities \\"to refrain from adopting measures incompatible with the right to return and with international human rights standards, such as discriminatory legislation ... [and] to cooperate in the establishment of a permanent international human rights office in Gali and to admit United Nations civilian police without further delay.\\"Report of the Representative of the Secretary- General on the human rights of internally displaced persons ‚Äì Mission to Georgia .

Before 2001, when Winchester services opened, it was the only service station on the M3. In 2006, it was one of the first service stations to carry the new corporate identity for Welcome Break, and along with it came a new Burger King franchise, which then made Fleet Services one of the few motorway service stations to have a Burger King, a KFC and a McDonald's co-exist at the same service station. The McDonald's was part of a 1995 Welcome Break campaign to roll out franchises throughout its chain, but when Welcome Break's parent company was taken over by Granada, the latter's rival franchise of Burger King was instead introduced throughout the chain, but Fleet services (and Woodall), part of the original plan, continued to carry McDonald's despite this. Fleet cheat Fleet services were well known for the 'Fleet cheat' in which drivers took a back exit to the northbound side, which is meant for access by authorised vehicles only (as indicated by two no-entry signs with the aforementioned exception information underneath it), from Pale Lane in order to avoid traffic queues from the motorway. Because of a loophole in legislation, in which the original purpose of the signs cannot be enforced as if it were part of a public highway, thereby only falling under trespassing, people that took the 'Fleet cheat' could not be prosecuted in the normal way for violating these signs. In the 2000s, bollards were installed to prevent unauthorised access, but these bollards often malfunctioned, so ANPR cameras were added in July 2010, which then signalled the end of the 'Fleet cheat'.

Undaunted by these challenges, Curtis took the initiative and recruited judges and practitioners as voluntary lecturers to supplement himself and one other professor. He served in this capacity until 1971. He was later named Dean Emeritus by the university. UBC‚Äôs Faculty of Law began its first classes in September 1945, operating from old army huts transplanted to UBC at the end of World War II. Founding Dean Curtis fought hard for proper facilities for B.C.‚Äôs first law school, and on September 4, 1952, the University officially opened the first purpose-built law school building in Canada. By the 1970s, the Faculty had outgrown its first building and embarked on a major renovation including the addition of a new multi-story concrete structure built in the Brutalist style fashionable at the time. The new Law building re-opened on September 17, 1976 as the \\"George F. Curtis Building.\\" Curtis kept an office in the building until 2005, when he died at the age of 99. In August 2011, UBC Law will move into a brand new building on the same site named Allard Hall. A significant space in the building will be named \\"The George F. Curtis Dean's and Student Government Suite\\" which will house deans and administrative offices as well as offices and meeting space for the Law Student Society.

During its existence, the battalion had the distinction of being the only representative of the Isle of Man in the British Army, and the last Volunteer Force unit in the British Army. History Formation and early history Amidst rising tensions between the United Kingdom and France, a perceived threat of invasion by the much larger French Army, and a British Army stretched with imperial commitments, the Volunteer Force began to take shape from May 1859 as a citizen army of part-time rifle, artillery and engineer corps. The Isle of Man's first volunteers appeared on 29 September 1860 when three independent Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVC) were formed: the 1st Isle of Man RVC at Castletown, the 2nd Isle of Man RVC at Douglas, and the 3rd Isle of Man RVC at Ramsey. They were joined by the 4th Isle of Man RVC at Crosby on 24 April 1866. By the end of 1870, all had been disbanded except the 2nd Isle of Man Rifle Volunteer Corps. From July 1861, the \\"Major Commanding the Volunteer Forces in the Island\\" was Francis Pigott Stainsby Conant, Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man from 1860 to 1863.Leech's Guide and Directory of the Isle of Man- Its Scenery, History, Popular Customs, &c;, F. Leach, 1861, DirectoryKing William's College Register, 1833-1904, ed. H. S. Christopher, James Maclehose & Sons, 1904, p. xxv, \\"Past and Present Trustees\\" The unit was attached to the 15th Lancashire RVC from 1873 for drill and administration purposes and in 1877 to the 64th Lancashire RVC, before returning to the 15th Lancashire RVC in March 1880. As it was the only remaining RVC on the Isle of Man, it was renumbered as the 1st Isle of Man Rifle Volunteer Corps on 19 October 1880. At this time, it consisted of just one company and its HQ was in Douglas. The Childers Reforms of 1881 saw the Isle of Man Volunteers join The King's (Liverpool Regiment) on 1 July as a volunteer battalion. Notwithstanding this, in 1884 the unit was attached to the 19th Lancashire RVC for administrative purposes. Finally, on 1 March 1884, came the final redesignation as the 7th (Isle of Man) Volunteer Battalion, The King's (Liverpool Regiment), the junior battalion of the regiment. A detachment of nine men accompanied the 6th King's to South Africa during the Second Boer War. Evolution of the Territorial Force The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. However, the terms of the Act did not extend to the Isle of Man. Therefore, the 7th Battalion was the only volunteer battalion that did not move to the TF and it remained as the last volunteer force unit in the British Army. First World War On 4 August 1914, the 7th (Isle of Man) Volunteer Battalion was headquartered at Douglas and attached to the West Lancashire Division. It had a strength of just a single company and it was initially employed on guard duties. No. 2 Company was formed on 29 August 1914 and a third on 22 December 1914. With the formation of the Service Company on 6 March 1915, the remaining men in these three companies were formed into a new company which guarded the prisoner of war camp at Douglas until December 1916 when it was demobilized. The service company was formed in 1915 and posted to the 16th (Reserve) Battalion, The King's (Liverpool Regiment) at Hoylake in March 1915. In October 1915, the company transferred to the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, Cheshire Regiment at Birkenhead and became the 1st Manx (Service) Company. On 12 January 1916, the company joined the regular army's 2nd Battalion, Cheshire Regiment in Salonika as A Company. It remained with the 2nd Cheshires for the rest of the war and by the Armistice of Mudros on 30 September 1918 was with 84th Brigade, 28th Division, north of Lake Doiran. A second service company was formed on 27 November 1915 at Bidston Camp near Birkenhead. It was later broken up to supply drafts for France. The Isle of Man Volunteers were disbanded on 3 March 1920.

The Howe Caverns is a cave in Howes Cave, Schoharie County, New York. Howe Caverns is a popular tourist attraction, providing cave-goers with a sense of caving or spelunking, without needing the advanced equipment and training usually associated with such adventures. Howe Caverns is the second most visited natural attraction in New York State, after Niagara Falls. Geology Geologists believe the formation of the cave, which lies below ground, began several million years ago. Composed mainly of two types of limestone (Coeymans and Manlius) from different periods in the Earth's early history, deposited hundreds of millions of years ago when the Atlantic Ocean stretched far inland,\\"Science and Geology\\", Howe Caverns the cave contains a lake, called the Lake of Venus, as well as many speleothems. Discovery and development Inside the caverns The Howe Caverns is named after farmer Lester Howe, who discovered the cave on May 22, 1842. Noticing that his cows frequently gathered near some bushes at the bottom of a hill on hot summer days, Howe decided to investigate. Behind the bushes, Howe found a strong, cool breeze emanating from a hole in the Earth. Howe proceeded to dig out and explore the cave with his friend and neighbor, Henry Wetsel, on whose land the cave entrance was located. Even to this day, the cave is at a constant temperature of 52 degrees Fahrenheit, irrespective of the outside weather. Howe opened the cave to eight-hour public tours in 1843, and, as business grew, a hotel was built over the entrance. When Howe encountered financial difficulties, he sold off parts of his property until a limestone quarry purchased the remainder. The quarry's purchase included the hillside, which opened to the cave's natural entrance. Eventually, the cave was closed to the public, until an organization was formed in 1927 to reopen it. The organization spent the next two years undertaking development work to create another route into the cave. After completion of the work - including elevators, brick walkways, lighting, and handrails - the cave was reopened to visitors on Memorial Day, May 1929.\\"All About Howe Caverns\\", Howe Caverns The tour lasts about 80 minutes and shows the majority of the cave. Visitors begin at the elevators and continue to the end of Lake of Venus, which marks the end of the property. Beyond this point lie about of unconditioned and destroyed caverns, which lead to the quarry and the natural entrance. After a boat ride, visitors turn around and walk back the way they came, with two additional stops. In 2008, the cave was purchased by private owners. In 2011, the adventure park was assembled only featuring the ropes course and zip line. In recent years, an H2OGO ball has been added, along with a rock wall, air jumper, and a gemstone mining building. On July 8, 2015, one of the H2OGO water attractions was stolen. Howe Caverns offered a reward to anyone providing information that may lead to an arrest of the thief or thieves.\\"Howe Caverns offers reward for stolen H20Go ball\\", news10.com, July 9, 2015.Adams, Kyle.\\"Howe Caverns wants its ball back\\", The Daily Gazette, July 10, 2015.

Litchfieldite is composed of two varieties of feldspar (mostly albite but also some microcline), with nepheline, sodalite, cancrinite and calcite. The mafic minerals, when present, are magnetite and an iron-rich variety of biotite (lepidomelane). Occurrence The rock was named after its occurrence at Litchfield, Maine, USA, by Bayley in 1892.Litchfieldite and the Litchfield Sodalite Locality, Maine Geological SurveyWilliams, Howel, Francis J. Turner and Charles M. Gilbert, Petrography, Freeman, 1954, p. 117 It is a very rare rock and also occurs in Blue Mountain and French River, Canada; Soroy and Val River, Norway; Cevadais, Portugal; Cana√£, Industrial Minerals & Rocks, Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration; 7th ed. 2006, p. 661 Boca Nova, Itaj√∫ da Colonia and Peixes, Brazil. Petrology Besides the mineral composition litchfieldites are characterized by one or more of the following structures: * A gneissic appearance due to the alternation of leucocratic and mafic bearing mineral bands; * A foliated appearance, due to preferred orientation of platey minerals like lepidomelane biotite, * Parallel orientation of the optical axis of minerals like nepheline. * Occurrence within zoned bodies, enveloped by amphibole bearing syenites and quartz- syenites rocks, * Broken and/or bent twin lamellae in plagioclase (albite), * Mortar structure, * Biotite with kink banding structure and bent cleavage planes, * Occurrence as large boudin or scattered blocks at the surface, * Occurrence within metamorphic belt as elongated bodies parallel to the regional structures, * Isotopic age according to the regional metamorphism Origin There are two hypotheses for the origin of these rocks: :1) A pre- tectonic magmatic nepheline syenite :2) A synorogenic intrusion of neheline syenite Both schools of thought are in accordance that rocks like litchfieldite owe their mineral and structural characteristics to the metamorphism. Economy Due to the content of alkali elements and alumina, they are very important ore for the glass industry. The iron-bearing minerals when present are strongly magnetic and can be removed through a magnetic field.

Her mother was Woizero Lakiyaye, a noblewoman of Tigray who ruled in Tigrai region. Tiruwork Wube was a descendant of Ras Wolde Selassie who ruled much of the region and established his capital at Chalacot in the late 1700s. The family of Dejazmatch Wube were descended from Emperor Fasilides, and the Dejazmatch had long harbored ambitions of becoming Emperor himself. However, Tewodros II defeated Wube, and had himself crowned at the church of Derasge Maryam that Wube is said to have built for his own planned coronation. Tewodros is said to have especially hated Dejazmach Wube among his enemies and ordered that he be chained and imprisoned for life along with his sons. A deeply religious woman, Tiruwork Wube endured her father's condition by resorting to prayer and fasting, and planned on entering a convent. Marriage Following the death of Tewodros II's much loved first wife, Empress Tewabech Ali (who was Tiruwork's niece), his intimates began to discreetly look for an appropriate consort to provide him with an heir and to calm his more extreme moods as his late wife had done. Legend states that one of the Emperor's officers was attending Sunday services at a church at Derasge when Tewodros was staying there, and was struck at the beauty, the aristocratic deportment, and the deep piety of a woman worshiping there. He immediately went to the Emperor and told him he had seen the woman \\"meant to be the wife of my sovereign\\". Tewodros made inquiries, and learned that the woman was none other than the daughter of his enemy Wube Hayle Maryam. However, her royal bearing, her illustrious family tree, and great beauty impressed him sufficiently to want to marry the daughter of one of his greatest foes. Tiruwork Wube resisted, begging to be allowed to enter a convent, but her family prevailed upon her to marry the Emperor in hopes that the harsh imprisonment of her father and brothers might be ended, or at least eased. Unfortunately, the marriage was not a particularly happy one. Unlike his first wife, his new Empress was not able to calm his rages, and probably had little interest in doing so. The Emperor had ordered the conditions of imprisonment eased on Dejazmach Wube and his sons, but had not freed them as Empress Tiruwork had hoped, and this contributed to the coldness that developed between them. Tiruwork Wube also believed that in marrying Tewodros, whom her peers regarded as a usurper, she had married below her station. She deliberately refused to rise to her feet when he entered a room as was customary, often pretending not to have seen him. Once upon entering a room where his wife was seated, Tewodros found her reading a book of Psalms and pretending to not notice his entrance. He angrily asked he why she did not rise. The Empress ignored him. In a fury the Emperor loudly demanded to know why she dared to ignore him when he spoke to her, she casually looked up and said \\"I am speaking with someone far greater than you\\". The Emperor stormed out. Tiruwork Wube was cold and condescending to Tewodros, and he was angry and cruel in return. He philandered regularly, even referring to one of his mistresses as \\"Empress Yitemegnu\\".Six letters from Tewodros to Yitemegnu were found by the British in his fortress at Magdala. They have been published with a translation in David L. Appleyard (translator), Letters from Ethiopian Rulers (Early and Mid-Nineteenth Century) (Oxford: British Academy, 1985), pp. 161-183. They did however manage to produce a son, Dejazmach Alemayehu Tewodros, whom both adored. While the marriage was quite stormy, and they spent time separated from each other frequently, they were reconciled on several occasions, and were reconciled at the time that the British arrived in 1868 to free the European prisoners the Emperor had seized. On one occasion, when Menelik of Shewa arrived at Magdala with his army and threatened to take over the mountain citadel in Tewodros' absence, Empress Tiruwork was instrumental in rallying the Emperor's forces and repelling Menelik. Death Upon Tewodros II's defeat and suicide on Easter Monday1868, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force, Sir Robert Napier took Empress Tiruwork and her son under his protection. After initially agreeing to allow her son to go to England with the expedition while she returned to her native Simien, Empress Tiruwork then suddenly decided that she would accompany her son. Empress Tiruwork was suffering an illness, and the stress from the death of her husband and her uncertain future took their toll. Napier accorded the Empress every royal dignity and assured that Tewodros' family were treated appropriately. The Empress learned that her male relatives, in reply to Napier's request as to what should be done for the Empress, had said \\"do what you want with her\\". Hurt by this betrayal, she was also being harassed by a Captain Speedy from the British forces, who had previously been acquainted with Tewodros, and now constantly tried to get his widow to appoint him guardian to young Alemayehu. She asked Napier to keep him away, and he ordered Speedy to stop harassing the Empress. The expedition left for the coast, but the Empress' health began a swift decline. She died before she reached the coast, and her young orphaned son left for Britain without any relative at his side. Empress Tiruwork Wube was accorded full honors by the British troops as her body was carried away to the monastery of the Holy Trinity at Chalacot in Tigray, where her paternal grandfather had been buried.Hormuzd Rassam, Narrative of the British Mission, vol. 2 p. 348 She was mourned by her mother, Woizero Lakiyaye, who before departing with her daughter's body for Tigray, handed Napier a letter for Queen Victoria. In it, the grandmother of Dejazmach Alemayehu asked the British Queen to care for the little prince as if he were her own, as she herself, could no longer be of any help to him.Published in David L. Appleyard, Letters, with notes by Richard K.P. Pankhurst, pp. 147-151 The letter touched the Queen deeply, and she took over responsibility for Alemayehu's education. Queen Victoria wrote of her sadness in her diary when the Ethiopian prince died at age 19, just a few years later.The relevant passage from Victoria's diary is quoted in Appleyard, Letters, p. 150 n. 4 In addition to having been the aunt of her husband's first wife, Empress Tewabech Ali, Empress Tiruwork was also the first cousin of Empress Taytu Betul, consort of Emperor Menelik II.

Before Islam Traditional beliefs Kurdish people originally worshipped a pantheon or class of gods called d√™w, which are known as Daeva in English, although these gods were later seen as evil monsters, trolls or giants. They were replaced by the ahur√¢ gods, known in English as Asura, before they were merged into Ahura Mazda. The Kurds believed in a terrifying dragon that they called ejd√Æha, which is known as Zahhak in English. Origin story In Kurdish mythology, the ancestors of the Kurds fled to the mountains to escape the oppression of a king named Zahhak. It is believed that these people, like Kaveh the Blacksmith who hid in the mountains over the course of history created a Kurdish ethnicity. Mountains, to this day, are still important geographical and symbolic figures in Kurdish life. In common with other national myths, Kurdish mythology is used for political aims.

Alternate spellings include Sigel, Sigl, Siegl, and others. \\"Siegel\\" is also the modern German word for seal. The name ultimately derives from the Latin sigillum, meaning \\"seal\\" as in the \\"Seal of the City of New York\\": \\"Sigillum Civitatis Novi Eboraci.\\" The Germanicized derivative of the name was given to professional seal makers and engravers. Some researchers have attributed the surname to Sigel, referring to S√≥l (Sun), the goddess of the sun in Germanic mythology (Si»ùel or sigel in Old English / Anglo-Saxon), but that is highly speculative.  Variants, and false cognates  Variants may routinely include Siegel, Siegle, Sigl and Sigel (and presumably some bearers of these names are lineal descendants of ethnic Jews who changed the spellings of their surnames in the course of assimilating among other cultures: \\"Segal\\" and \\"Segel\\" are false cognates to Siegel, usually having deriving from a quite different root.) Most sources indicate that it derives from a Hebrew acronym the abbreviated form of Sagan Gadol ha-Leviya, which means Great assistant to the Levites, and is an honorific title bestowed upon a member of the tribe of Levi who performs synagogue duties faithfully. (Some Rabbis aver that Segal/Segall derives from the Hebrew s'gula, meaning \\"treasure.\\" However, this would not explain the association of the name only with the tribe of Levi.) Further, the double-L in Segall seems to be a specifically Rumanian (language) spelling variant.

Some have claimed since the mid-Edo period that such ancient characters, for example such as Chikushi characters and Hokkaido characters, have been found in archeological remains, in Kofun and on mountains, but all jindai moji are generally considered to be forgeries. No earthenware with such characters has ever been found. Hokkaido characters investigated by Enomoto Takeaki and John Milne  History  The concept of jindai moji was first addressed at the end of the Kamakura period. Urabe no Kanekata (ÂçúÈÉ®ÂÖºÊñπ) mentioned in Shaku Nihongi that his father. Urabe no Kanefumi, argued that the ancient Japanese could not have performed bone-style fortunetelling with turtleshells (‰∫ÄÂçú, Kameura, \\"turtle fortunetelling\\"), as described in the Nihon Shoki, without having a writing system. Some examples of jindai moji appeared during the Edo period, each set being named after its supposed source. Even then, the authenticity of jindai moji was supported by scholars such as Tsurumine Shigenobu (È∂¥Â≥ØÊàäÁî≥), and at least one scholar, Hirata Atsutane, changed his opinion from negative to positive. Other scholars, such as Kaibara Ekken, Dazai Shundai (Â§™ÂÆ∞Êò•Âè∞), Kamo no Mabuchi, Motoori Norinaga and T≈ç Teikan (Ëó§Ë≤ûÂππ), rejected both the concepts and the claimed examples. The most famous article denying the existence of jindai moji was Jindaiji ben (Á•û‰ª£Â≠óÂºÅ), attached to Kana no motosue (‰ªÆÂ≠óÊú¨Êú´) by Ban Nobutomo (‰º¥‰ø°Âèã). The skepticism about jindai moji that developed in the Edo period has been the prevailing attitude among scholars ever since.Naozumi Ochiai Thoughts on Japanese Ancient Characters [Êó•Êú¨Âè§‰ª£ÊñáÂ≠óËÄÉ] Komakisha 1888; republished by Yahata Shoten 1982 In 1930, a religious sect, Amatsuky≈ç, was charged with Lese-majesty by the special higher police. Amatsuky≈ç had used documents that were partly written in what its members said were jindai moji. Experts in linguistics and other scholars gave evidence in court that the documents were forgeries. However, the documents and other artifacts of this sect were destroyed in the American bombardment of Tokyo.  Reasons for skepticism  # The Kogo Sh≈´i, written in 808, clearly states that the Japanese had no writing system, and thus no characters, before Kanji were imported, and nobody before Urabe no Kanekata (mentioned above) made any reference to such \\"ancient characters.\\" # The examples of jindai moji that have been put forward over the years have all clearly been based on Modern Japanese, which had five vowels, and not Old Japanese, which until the Heian period had eight vowels. # Shinkichi Hashimoto studied documents written in Man'y≈çgana during the Nara period and found the J≈çdai Tokushu Kanazukai, proving that there were 88 sounds in the ancient language, but jindai moji have only 50 or fewer, matching the Goj≈´on and Iroha of the Heian period. # If jindai moji had been in use before the Japanese became aware of Kanji, it is impossible to explain why they would have swiftly and totally abandoned such characters in favour of the much more complex new characters derived from China, or why they then went on to develop Man'y≈çgana, Hiragana and Katakana, all of which are based on Kanji and show no evidence of any connection with jindai moji.  Claims in favor of jindai moji  # Some recent writers have interpreted the following passage in the Shaku Nihongi to support their view that jindai moji were in use in ancient Japan: \\"There are six or seven documents written in characters of Hi Province(ËÇ•‰∫∫„ÅÆÂ≠ó„ÄÅAhiru characters) in the Ministry of the Treasury.\\" # It was reported in the late 19th century that ancient characters had been found in RyukyuÁ•ûË∞∑Áî±ÈÅìÔºà1886Ôºâ„ÄéÊù±‰∫¨‰∫∫È°ûÂ≠¶‰ºöÂ†±Âëä„ÄèÁ¨¨9Âè∑ Yoshimichi Kamiya Ôºà1886Ôºâ Anthropological Science ÔºàJapanese SeriesÔºâ No. 9 and in Ezo,Âù™‰∫ïÊ≠£‰∫îÈÉéÔºà1887Ôºâ„ÄéÊù±‰∫¨‰∫∫È°ûÂ≠¶‰ºöÈõëË™å„ÄèÁ¨¨18Âè∑ Shogoro Tsuboi(1887) Anthropological Science ÔºàJapanese SeriesÔºâ No. 18 and these claims received some support from respectable mainstream scholars, at least at the time.

The Hands Resist Him is a painting created by artist Bill Stoneham in 1972. It depicts a young boy and female doll standing in front of a glass paneled door against which many hands are pressed. According to Stoneham, the boy is based on a photograph of himself at age five. The doorway is a representation of the dividing line between the waking world and the world of fantasy and impossibilities, while the doll is a guide that will escort the boy through it. The titular hands represent alternate lives or possibilities., The painting became the subject of an urban legend and a viral internet meme in February 2000 when it was posted for sale on eBay along with a description implying that it was haunted.Bevis, Gavin (06-2002) The eBay Haunted Painting, BBC, 2007-05-13) History The painting was first displayed at the Feingarten Gallery in Beverly Hills, California, during the early 1970s. A one-man Stoneham show at the gallery, which included the piece, was reviewed by the art critic at the Los Angeles Times. During the show, the painting was purchased by actor John Marley, notable for his role as Jack Woltz in The Godfather. Sometime after Marley's death, the painting was found on the site of an old brewery, by an elderly Californian couple, (as stated in their original eBay listing). The painting appeared on the auction website eBay in February 2000. According to the seller, the aforementioned couple, the painting carried some form of curse. Their eBay description made a series of claims that the painting was cursed or haunted. Included in those claims were that the characters in the painting moved during the night, and that they would sometimes leave the painting and enter the room in which it was being displayed. Also included with the listing were a series of photographs that were said to be evidence of an incident in which the female doll character threatened the male character with a gun that she was holding, causing him to attempt to leave the painting. A disclaimer was included with the listing absolving the seller from all liability if the painting was purchased. News of the listing was quickly spread by internet users who forwarded the link to their friends or wrote their own pages about it. Some people claimed that simply viewing the photos of the painting made them feel ill or have unpleasant experiences. Eventually, the auction page was viewed over 30,000 times. After an initial bid of $199, the painting eventually received 30 bids and sold for $1,025.00. The buyer, Perception Gallery in Grand Rapids, Michigan, eventually contacted Bill Stoneham and related the unusual story of its auction on eBay and their acquisition of it. He reported being quite surprised by all the stories and strange interpretations of the images in the painting. According to the artist, the object presumed by the eBay sellers to be a gun is actually nothing more than a dry cell battery and a tangle of wires. Stoneham recalls that both the owner of the gallery in which the painting was first displayed, and the art critic who reviewed it, died within one year of coming into contact with the painting. New paintings in the series An individual who saw the story about the original painting contacted Stoneham about commissioning a sequel.\\"The Hands...\\" Series from Stoneham Studios Stoneham accepted and painted a sequel called Resistance at the Threshold.Resistance at the Threshold from Stoneham Studios The sequel depicts the same characters 40+ years later in the same style as the original. A second sequel, Threshold of Revelation, resolves mysteries of the boy's life including that of the doll/girl (perhaps his real sister, discovered late in their lives), was completed in 2012 and can be seen on Stoneham's website.Threshold of Revelation from Stoneham Studios Several years later, a third commission was requested, this time for a prequel. Stoneham created The Hands Invent Him, depicting the artist as a boy who is behind the original painting's door and who holds a paint brush amongst other visual elements. On March 15, 2017, the Haunted Museum in Las Vegas, Nevada, announced it had acquired the prequel painting. All three commissioned paintings can be seen on Stoneham's website \\"The Sequels\\".

It is a road and rail junction and a market town. Population: History Roslavl was founded as Rostislavl in the 1130s or 1140s. The name is likely due to Prince Rostislav of Smolensk, who was the founder of the fortress. It belonged to the Principality of Smolensk. The area belonged intermittently to the Principality of Smolensk and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1376, Roslavl was transferred to Lithuania and became the center of a principality.

Under Polish-Lithuanian rule Roslavl was part of the Smolensk Voivodeship. In 1667, according to the Truce of Andrusovo, Roslavl was transferred back to Russia. During all this period, it was a fortress at the border, and the fortifications were extensively used. The last time they were in use in 1706, during the Great Northern War. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Smolensk Governorate and remained there until 1929, with the exception of the brief periods between 1713 and 1726, when it belonged to Riga Governorate, and between 1775 and 1796, when Smolensk Governorate was transformed into Smolensk Viceroyalty. It was the center of Roslavlsky Uyezd. On 12 July 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Roslavlsky District with the administrative center in Roslavl was established. The district belonged to Roslavl Okrug of Western Oblast, which had its administrative center in Roslavl. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On 27 September 1937 Western Oblast was abolished and split between Oryol and Smolensk Oblasts. Roslavlsky District was transferred to Smolensk Oblast. Between August 3, 1941 to September 25, 1943, during WWII, the district was occupied by German troops.

She convinces Viki to go through with a planned trip out-of-town and, taking a cue from Viki's \\"gatekeeper\\" personality, \\"Jean Randolph,\\" Tess commissions a secret room to be built in Llanfair's basement, including soundproofed walls and a closed- circuit television feed of other rooms in the house. Though Todd and then Jessica's visiting aunt Tina Lord realize that Tess has returned, Tess manages to blackmail them both to guarantee their silence, and enlists their reluctant collusion in her crimes. After drugging Natalie, Tess imprisons her in the newly built secret room. Trapped and forced to watch the goings-on in Llanfair via hidden cameras, Natalie is horrified as Tess begins her campaign to convince Jared that Natalie has left him and Llanview, keeping them separated forever. A \\"Dear John\\" letter and Tess' lies fail to convince Jared that Natalie has truly left him, and he soon suspects that Tess is in control. He discovers Natalie's prison, but finds himself trapped inside with her. Tess realizes her plan is unraveling as Viki returns and soon has her own suspicions. A pregnant Tess sets a bomb to take care of Jared and Natalie once and for all, but goes into premature labor and flees to Nash and Jessica's abandoned vineyard cottage. Alone and afraid, Tess conjures up a hallucination of Niki Smith -- the only \\"mother\\" Tess has ever known. Niki chastises Tess for her evil deeds and urges her to repent, telling Tess that she is simply transferring her rage at Niki's own negligence during Jessica's childhood onto Jared and Natalie, and pushes her to make things right and save the people at Llanfair. Tess agrees to go back and deactivate the bomb, but is struck by another wave of contractions before she can. With Niki's help, Tess delivers a severely premature baby girl on November 6, 2008; the baby is stillborn. Jared and Natalie are saved; the trauma of the baby's death triggers a second alter, named Bess, to emerge in Jessica. Just as Jessica's psyche had modelled Tess after Viki's extroverted Niki, Bess is a \\"gatekeeper\\" personality modeled after Viki's cold, clinical alter Jean Randolph, who is obsessed with control, order, and above all, protection of the core personality. Realizing that neither Jessica nor Tess can handle the child's death, Bess goes to Llanview Hospital and switches Jessica's stillborn daughter with the newborn daughter of her cousin Starr. With everyone (including Jessica and Tess) believing that Starr's baby Hope has died and Jessica's daughter Chloe is alive, Jessica checks herself into St. Ann's for treatment. The trauma unresolved, Tess suspects that something is amiss with Chloe, but she is suppressed by Bess. Jessica befriends fellow patient Brody Lovett, who sees Jessica's illness first-hand as Tess tries to manipulate him into aiding her escape. Bess tells Tess that her obsession with getting revenge against Jared and Natalie, and subsequent failure to seek any prenatal treatment, had caused her baby's death. Seeking to hide the secret once and for all, Bess distracts Jessica with the realization that she \\"allowed\\" Tess to emerge to punish Natalie and Jared, and convinces Tess to stay quiet and pretend that all of Jessica's personalities are integrated. Months later, Jared and Natalie discover that the babies were switched, but decide to keep the secret to preserve Jessica's fragile sanity. In May 2009 Jessica herself begins to remember more about the night she gave birth. With everyone around her now aware of the truth and waiting for Jessica's psychologist to help them break the news to her, Bess emerges and runs off with the baby, taking Chloe to Nash's parents' house, far away.

Brody and Langston are unsuccessful and Tess and Ford return to Llanview married.

The judge agrees to this, granting them temporary custody of Ryder. Ford is devastated that he's lost his son, and furious that Tess didn't say what she knew about Aubrey and Joey.

Meanwhile, Jessica is struggling with Bess, and tries to take control back from Tess. On May 11, 2011, Brody and Cutter argues with each other over Cutter's relationship with Jessica and Tess which causes her to split into a male alter, Wes (Wes is based on Brody's deceased fellow Navy SEAL friend Wes Granger and the equivalent of Viki's alter Tommy), who is meant to push all men away from Jessica. Wes leaves Cutter's hotel room and arrives at Capricorn, where he attempts to flirt with Aubrey and Rama. Cutter lures Wes back to the Minute Man Motel, and kisses him, attempting to get Tess back.

Brody asks what it means, and Bess simply says she doesn't know. Cutter cuts in and demands that Bess brings Tess back, but Bess scoffs at him and asks what Tess even sees in him. Brody pleads with Bess to bring Jessica back, but Bess says that Jessica is still healing and will return eventually. Bess retreats from the scene and Tess returns, so Brody is forced to let her go. Cutter tells Tess he is taking her away from Llanview, but unknowingly to Tess, he plans to commit her to St. Anne's so Jessica can come home in exchange for a piece of the Buchanan fortune and the Buchanan mansion. Tess later sees Ford kissing a Llanview Hospital nurse. Cutter betrays Tess and puts her into St. Anne's for a piece of the Buchanan fortune and the Buchanan mansion in an extortion deal he made with Clint and Viki. Sometime later, Ford sneaks into St. Anne's to set Tess free, but is caught and thrown out. Bess confronts Tess and tells her it is time to set Jessica free again, but Tess refuses. Later, Ford sneaks in again, this time disguised as a nun and professes his love to Tess, and the two proceed to make love; however, inside Tess's head, Jessica manages to overtake all her alters and appears to integrate herself. Jessica, having finally incorporated all of her personalities back within herself, rushes home to find Brody and Natalie in bed. Ford later comes back to the motel room they were hiding out in at the Minute Man Motel after Ford helped Tess escape from St. Anne's with the divorce papers that he (along with Rama blackmailing Cutter over his mysterious secret) convinces Cutter to sign divorce papers to end his marriage to Tess, only to find Tess nowhere in sight. When Jessica returns she finds Natalie and Brody in bed with each other. Jessica is arguing with Brody and Natalie, saying they betrayed her a second time, only this time, Brody fights back, saying that she was hiding behind Tess and used Wes to hurt him. Jessica denies any intention of hurting anyone, and Brody says that's because no one expects \\"Princess Jessica\\" to do any of those things. Angrier than ever, Jessica ends her relationship with Brody and vows revenge on him and Natalie, saying that she does not need Tess to deal with them anymore, and she will handle them later. Some time later, she visits Ryder and Bree, and goes to see Clint at the hospital. She is horrified about Gigi's death, but is determined to see that Clint receives her heart. She returns home to take care of Ryder when Ford walks in, calling out for Tess. Unknowingly to him, it is Jessica who is glaring back at him. Jessica, now with Tess's attributes, argues with Ford, telling him he will never see Tess or Ryder again. Ford backs off, but vows not to give up on them. Later, Jessica is passing Natalie in the hallway, and they lash out at each other. Natalie says Jessica hid behind Tess and it is her fault. Jessica says that she would never betray her sister, and she will pay her back on her own, not as Tess. Natalie asks if that is a threat, and Jessica simply smirks and says not to worry, and it will happen when she least expects it. Jessica walks away, saying coyly, \\"I wonder what John McBain is up to?\\", while Natalie ponders if there is possibly something between John and Jessica. Viki advised Jessica not to give up on Brody. Jessica calls him and they both apologize for the argument. Jessica said she got over the fact that Brody and Natalie were sleeping together and had a child but asked if the second time was an accident too. Brody doesn't answer which made Jessica think it was not an accident. Jessica ends the conversation then Ford comes out and abducts Jessica. There they learn how to have equal rights to Ryder and how he can be a part of their lives. Later, Natalie talks to Jessica that she and Brody are going to have a life together. Outraged and hurt Jessica yells at Natalie which makes Natalie say that the thing she liked about Tess is that she took responsibility for her actions and had no problem showing her dislike for her. Still angry Jessica punches Natalie. Viki witnesses the altercation and says that Bree saw and heard the fight. Jessica then leaves to talk to Bree. Natalie tells Viki every single time she tries to talk to her she gets mad. Jessica and Natalie have another fight and Jessica suggest that she and Brody live together because she doesn't want to see either of them. Brody then agree which leaves Jessica and Natalie shocked. Brody has to leave to go to work leaving Jessica and Natalie in the garden fighting. When the two walk angrily out the door Ford watches and causes to Jessica crying on his shoulder. Ford comforts her and he, Jessica, Ryder, and Bree go to the park for a family date. Viki then suspects the two bonding. Ford later comments to James how this new Jessica seems to act more like Tess (giving her the dub name New Jessica). On August 11, 2011 Jessica sees the man with her uncle Todd's original face at Llanfair and is considering the fact that the man who she believed to be Todd for eight years isn't Todd. On September 28, 2011 Natalie and Jessica bumped into each other in Angel Square. Before Natalie was able to say anything, Jessica acknowledged that she'd heard the news about Natalie's engagement to Brody. Sarcastically, Jessica asked to see Natalie's ring, and she grabbed Natalie's hand. Jessica thought that the ring was a \\"pretty little diamond,\\" and she suggested that because of Natalie's hand size, the ring should have been larger. Jessica also thought that it would have been a good idea for Natalie to just use Jessica's ring instead. Natalie was apologetic and stated that she just wanted to make things right between the two of them. Jessica wondered how things could be nice and okay after Natalie had stolen Jessica's fianc√©. Natalie disagreed, and she began to explain how Brody had waited for Jessica for months. Jessica saw things differently. She believed that Natalie had accepted Brody as a consolation prize, after John had rejected her twice. Jessica figured that Natalie would leave Brody in a second, if John were to change his mind. Natalie didn't think that was a fair assessment, and she was angry. She, Brody and Liam were a family. Jessica wondered how it would be around holiday tables, and she stated that the family was not happy with Natalie's choice. Natalie insisted that Viki was happy, but Jessica felt that Viki hadn't had a choice. Jessica accused Natalie of successfully destroying the family just as she'd set out to do when she'd first arrived in Llanview. Natalie couldn't believe that Jessica had held onto that thought after so many years. Natalie accused Jessica of walking all over her, and Natalie would no longer stand for it. Jessica called her \\"trailer trash\\" who had slept with her sister's fianc√©. Natalie pointed out that at least she hadn't hidden behind her mental illness, and she accused Jessica of enjoying being Tess in order to torture Brody. Jessica had been able to order him around and be a bitch, Natalie added. The argument continued to escalate. Jessica called Natalie trash again, and she shouted that she wished they'd never found out that Natalie had really been a Buchanan. They had all been happy before Natalie's arrival. Natalie reminded Jessica that she was actually more family than Jessica was. Natalie's real father was Clint, while Jessica's father was Mitch Laurence. Jessica was appalled, and she snapped that Clint was her father in every way. She had always been Clint's daughter. \\"Your father is a deranged psycho killer that killed my husband when you didn't finish the job yourself,\\" Natalie accused. Jessica retorted that she hadn't been responsible for the fact that Mitch had killed many people. Natalie added that she had forgiven Jessica for her wrongs, but Jessica had been unable to return the favor. \\"Brody is lucky to be rid of you,\\" Natalie growled. \\"You are Mitch Laurence's psycho daughter and always will be,\\" she concluded. Jessica slugged Natalie in the face with all of the strength she could muster. Natalie grabbed her head and then slapped Jessica as hard as she could. The growing argument had turned physical, and the girls grabbed and pulled at each other until they fell to the ground. Brody left Clint and happened to find Jessica and Natalie fighting in Angel Square. He pulled the young women apart, and he picked Natalie up. He carried her away from the scene as Jessica screamed after them. \\"I hate you. I'm gonna hate you til the day that you die,\\" she yelled. After Ford and Jessica make an agreement about Ryder they start to get closer. When she finds Liam's paternity test she confides in Ford and that brings them even closer together. On November 15, Jessica and Ford have sex. 2012 In January 2012, Allison Perkins shows up at Llanfair, dropping hints about Jessica and Natalie's true paternity. She then reveals that both of the Buchanan twins are biologically Clint's. Allison altered the paternity results and lied to Mitch Laurence that Jessica was his. Clint refuses to believe this and says to Viki, \\"Do you really believe this lunatic?\\" In revenge, Allison shoots Viki and flees. Clint reaches for the phone but collapses beside Viki. Meanwhile, Jessica is at the hospital with Ford, who got into a showdown with Mitch Laurence. While struggling for the gun, Mitch shoots at the chandelier which falls on Ford leaving him unconscious and possibly dying. Jessica is then devastated when the doctor reveals that Ford died from the injuries he sustained from the chandelier. In the series finale, Jessica and Natalie fully reconcile, as it is revealed through a DNA test that Jessica is indeed Clint's daughter. Following this, Brody shows up at Llanfair having just been released from St. Ann's. He apologizes for everything that happened between them, and so does Jessica. He mentions how he will be heading back into the Navy.

The term refers to everything and anything that improves one's home, life and appearance. It is often based on household items from the West that are regarded as kitsch in their countries of origin, but it can also be Japanese goods, mainly from the fifties, sixties, and seventies. In Japan there are also so-called Asian Kakka in de zakka stores; that usually refers to Southeast Asia. The interest in Nordic design or Scandinavian design, both contemporary and past, is also part of this zakka movement. Zakka can also be contemporary handicraft. Zakka has also been described as \\"the art of seeing the savvy in the ordinary and mundane\\". The zakka boom could be recognized as merely another in a series of consumer fads, but it also touches issues of self-expression and spirituality. \\"Cute, corny and kitschy is not enough. To qualify as a zakka, a product must be attractive, sensitive, and laden with subtext.\\" The Danish independent film Zakka West (2003) by Mikael Colville- Andersen is one of the first examples of the zakka fad reaching the West.

It is a Gothic Revival house, built in 1865, according to family history. It is a -story brick structure with a three-bay facade. It incorporates a central entrance with side-lights, and a transom window with Italianate brackets. It has been called the \\"Old Brick\\" from time immemorial. The brick house behind the building has long been called the \\"slave quarters\\", and Thomas Huey owned half a dozen slaves; however none of them ever lived here, as the house was built after the war was over. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. According to family legend Mr. Huey, who was born at Big Bone, in 1805, buried his money, all gold and silver, in a great chest before the war. He dug it up after the war and used the money to build the house. Burying money is a very common story, though it is common because so many people actually did it; in this case it may or may not have actually been so, but there can be little doubt that many people probably did bury their money before or during the war with so many rascally Yankees about. A great- granddaughter purchased the house in the 1930s and lived there for years. She (and many of the other members of the family) claimed the house to be haunted. She engaged in lengthy on-again-off-again shooting duel with her sister, who lived across the road, and it is possible the family ghosts left during her tenure. According to this occupant, she could \\"hear grandma chasing great- grandma through the attic at night.\\" This is supposed to have been the result of the two women being frozen to death in the attic by a wicked in-law. It is unusual, according to Kentucky historian (and \\"ghostwriter\\") Professor Lynwood Montell, but not unheard of, for two ghosts to reside in the same Kentucky house. People who have moved into the area not knowing the old story have told me that from observation they believe the house is haunted. They were very interested, of course, to hear confirmation of a conclusion they had arrived at independently.

The name stems from the fact that fairy lights were hung from the music and microphone stands. Two live albums were released during this time, one as Fairy Light Nights in 2000 (sometimes referred to as Fairy Light Nights 1) and Fairy Light Nights 2 a year later. These recordings were also later released as a double album, Acoustic Nights, in 2003. The \\"Fairy Light Night\\" concerts featured a simple line-up of Julianne Regan on lead vocals, Marty Willson-Piper on a variety of acoustic guitars and backing vocals, and Andy Cousin on electric bass or acoustic 12-string guitar, with occasional guest appearances by other musicians. Background In late 1999 All About Eve played three fully electric reunion concerts in support of The Mission. During this time Willson- Piper persuaded Regan to keep the group going and do a few acoustic gigs. The rationale for choosing acoustic gigs included Willson-Piper's previous experience of doing them himself, the lower cost (the band at this time being wholly self-funded) and the fact that, at that point, the band had no drummer - Mark Price not being able to leave Del Amitri on a long-term basis. The very first Fairy Light Night was on 25 January 2000 at the Warwick Arts Centre in Regan's hometown of Coventry. Success by word of mouth The first gigs were extremely well received by fans, with word-of-mouth and internet forums allowing renewed interest in the band to spread rapidly. Most of the gigs were very well attended, with many being full to capacity. Within six months, a CD entitled Fairy Light Nights was released, this being a recording of performances taken from various gigs. A year later, attendance at the gigs and sales of the CD were such that it was considered viable to release a second album, Fairy Light Nights 2, containing further songs which had been recorded at the same time but not included on the original album. Ups and downs In all there were nearly 100 gigs, at a frequency of more than one a week at the height of activity. The band played as far north as Aberdeen and as far south as Penzance. Most of the shows were held by both the fans and the band to be extremely successful, although the one in Worthing is often cited by all who were there as a low point in the tour: because Marty's amplifiers were too loud for the venue and created intolerable feedback for the first few songs, Willson-Piper was forced to sit out the rest of the gig without playing, putting him in a foul mood and causing him to berate the audience between songs. End of the era The last Fairy Light Night was in Crewe on 3 February 2002. This was also the last All About Eve concert to feature Willson-Piper, who would leave the band citing musical differences immediately afterwards. He was replaced in the spring of that year by a Finn, Toni Haimi, lately of bands such as Nozzle and Malluka. By the time they went back on tour again in May, they were a five-piece band and the subsequent gigs were fully electric. Other activity during this period All About Eve also played some fully electric dates during this time: these do not technically count as Fairy Light Nights but were equally well received by fans. These gigs included the 2000 Cropredy Festival where devoted fans sat through two hours of the Incredible String Band before All About Eve finally came on. These fully electric gigs included a concert at the Union Chapel in December 2000, which was recorded and later released as the album Live and Electric at the Union Chapel. The success of this concert and the comparatively high sales of the album encouraged the band to hold another, equally successful, concert in the same venue a year later. New songs during this time No new All About Eve songs were premiered during any Fairy Light Night: however, three songs by Willson-Piper (and already existing on his solo albums) were performed, these being \\"Forever\\", \\"You Bring Your Love to Me\\" and \\"Will I Start To Bleed?\\" None of these has been performed as All About Eve songs since Willson-Piper's departure. \\"Miss World\\" was previously a Mice song but this has been performed as an All About Eve song since.

Since then two records of unclear legality have been released without the band's permission, entitled Unplugged and Martha's Harbour. A third version, All About Eve's What Kind of Fool, has also been released, available as download only through many mainstream download music sites. All three releases contain identical material to Fairy Light Nights 1. The second album, Fairy Light Nights 2, was released by JamTart, the band's own label and so not subjected to the same re-issuing conflicts. Acoustic Nights This is a JamTart repackaging of both Fairy Light Nights CDs into a double album. The band fully approved it, although they emphasis that it contains nothing not already included in the two single albums.

An estimated 20,000 people worked in the company's factories by the 1920s, and an even greater number worked there during the boom years of the mid-1940s when, helped by footwear it produced for the military during the war years, it was producing 52 million pairs of shoes a year. During the early 1950s, the work force was still approximately 17,000 to 18,000. Today, EJ Footwear, LLC operates as a unit of Nelsonville, Ohio-based Rocky Shoes & Boots, Inc.  Founding  Postcard view of one of the Johnson City (then Lestershire) factory complexes. Much of the history of E-J was documented only in such post-card images. The Endicott Johnson Corporation grew out of the Lester Brothers Boot and Shoe Company, which began in Binghamton in 1854. In 1890, the Lester Brothers moved their business west to a nearby rural area, which in 1892 was incorporated as the Village of Lestershire and in 1916 became Johnson City. Financial problems in 1890 forced the sale of the company to a creditor and fellow shoemaker, Henry Bradford Endicott of Dedham, Massachusetts, who founded the Endicott Shoe Company and in 1899 made factory foreman George F. Johnson his partner.  George F. and the Square Deal  The E-J story is dominated by George F. Johnson (1857‚Äì1948), or George F as he was popularly called, who rose through the shoe factory ranks to become the half-owner of E-J, and its highest executive until his death in 1948. George F's reign was dominated by his Square Deal version of welfare capitalism that, like progressive movements of the early twentieth century, advocated providing parades and churches and libraries to \\"uplift\\" workers. George F's Square Deal consisted of worker benefits even in harsh economic times that were generous and innovative for their time, but also meant to engender worker loyalty and discourage unionizing. The company had a chess and checkers club. For workers, the Square Deal consisted of a chance to buy E-J built and E-J financed homes, a profit sharing program, health care from factory-funded medical facilities and later (built in 1949) two worker recreational facilities. But the Square Deal was more than an employee benefit program. E-J and the Johnson family also provided or helped to finance two libraries, theaters, a golf course, swimming pools, carousels, parks and food markets, many of which were available to the community without charge. Reminders of the source of that generosity were inescapable: Example of EJ's dress shoes from the 1920sEndicott was a community planned by E-J and incorporated in 1906. It was named after Henry B. Endicott (one of the grade schools was named Henry B,) who owned the business that became E-J. Lestershire was renamed Johnson City, New York in honor of George F. All of the tanneries and the vast majority of the shoe factories were located in Endicott with a few satellite locations in Johnson City and Binghamton. The Johnsons lived in Endicott and George F's mansion was donated to the Village after his death and became the public library. Most of the jobs were classified as \\"piece work.\\" Racks of shoes moved through the factories with \\"coupons\\" attached to each rack. When the worker completed his/her operation on the rack of shoes, he or she removed the appropriate coupon which was worth a few pennies. At the end of the week the worker turned in his coupons from which the payroll department calculated pay. The work was hard and the pay was low, but the extensive benefits were offsets. The windows in the factories were painted so workers wouldn't be distracted by the outside. The company needed a large labor pool and initiated a recruitment program aimed at southern Italy and the Slavic countries and so Endicott became a small town with a rich ethnic mix. Many of the sons and daughters of these immigrants graduated from Union-Endicott High School and went on to become teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, and successful business people. Very few went to work in the factories.  The E-J Workers Arch and other monuments  E-J Workers Arch 140x140px The entrance to Johnson City on Main Street from Binghamton is marked with a stone arch embossed with Home of the Square Deal. There is a corresponding arch on the other end of Main Street that served as the entrance to Endicott. Square Deal Arch on the border between Binghamton and Johnson CityE-J workers paid for and erected these arches. Both arches were dedicated on September 6, 1920. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. *One of the E-J swimming pools was shaped in the outline of a gigantic shoe sole. * The Triple Cities contain a number of statues of the Johnson family, including Johnson City's statue of Harry L. Johnson (George F's youngest brother), and Binghamton's statue of George F. Johnson in the George F. Johnson Recreation Park, and, also in Recreation Park, the Harry L. Johnson memorial. * Endicott had En-Joie Park (with E and the J capitalized to evoke E-J). The Triple Cities Parks contained a carousel called \\"merry go rounds\\" and they also contained playground equipment, a baseball diamond, picnic areas, a large swimming pool, and a band stand. During the summer the Endicott-Johnson workers band performed concerts every Sunday evening in Endicott En-Joy Park. There were also recreation buildings in Endicott and Johnson City, which contained subsidized bowling alleys in the basement and a large banquet room on the main floor. Retirement dinners were given on a regular basis in the recreation centers. Any employee could attend the dinners for $.25.Charles F. Johnson Pool, Charles F. Johnson Park * Various roads and bridges refer to the Johnsons, including CFJ Boulevard in Johnson City, and the C. Fred Johnson Bridge over the Susquehanna River (part of Expressway Route 201), which was named in honor of Charles F. Johnson (an older brother of George F.) * The word Ideal appeared in many places, including E-J's first (1901) factory in Endicott, Endicott's Ideal Home Library (contributed to Endicott by George F) and Ideal Hospital. The library was later demolished to make room for municipal facilities and relocated to George F's former mansion. The use of repetitions and iterations of \\"ideal,\\" \\"En-Joie,\\" and other words (such as \\"Endwell\\" used for both a line of E-J shoes, and later in the renaming of the hamlet of Hooper to Endwell, New York) were part of E-J's ongoing public relations campaign to discourage unionizing by convincing workers that E-J's Square Deal was the \\"ideal\\" relationship between capital and labor. At the same time labor organizer Samuel Gompers visited E-J on several occasions, and spent time with both rank and file employees and with the Johnsons. When asked why no attempt had been made to organize E-J workers, Gompers said that E-J already gave workers more than unions had achieved elsewhere, and that the Federation of Labor was working to bring other workforces to the pay and benefits levels E-J provided on its own initiative. Monument to Harry L. Johnson But the Square Deal campaign also created a cult of personality about Johnson family which is reflected, as examples: * in the inscription in the Harry L. Johnson memorial states \\"This Fountain Was Given By The School Children In Memory Of Their Friend Harry L. Johnson MCMXXII;\\" and * in the inscription accompanying a statue of George F. Johnson which states \\"Have Faith In The People. George F. Johnson. Erected By An Appreciative Community To The Nobility Of His Character And His Great Benefactions To The People. 1923.

Johnson erected by \\"Endicott Johnson workers and citizens of Johnson City\\" which contains the Johnson motto \\"BE NOT WEARY IN WELL DOING.\\" which is from the Bible Galatians 6:9\\"Bygone Binghamton: Remembering People and Places of the Past Volume One,\\" p. 254 By Jack Edward Shay  Decline and sale  Various members of the Johnson family helmed E-J until outside management was brought in starting in 1957. By then, the company had begun a slow decline. The tanneries closed in 1968. E-J's medical department was not closed until 1969, and the plan to close the last of its shoe manufacturing plants in the Triple Cities area was not announced until April 1998. The demise of the E-J was rooted in many economic changes. Its founding principles of valuing labor were threatened by the availability of cheap foreign labor and the rise of global shoemakers such as Nike. According to some sources, C. F. Johnson was a vehement critic of free trade, and believed that it was contrary to his glorification of the American worker. The demise of the company may also be attributable, in part, to bad business decisions, including the continuation of its focus during the 1950s on work shoes when the market for lighter, more stylish shoes was expanding and potentially more profitable. In 1995, E-J was purchased by US Industries. Inc. and its name was changed to EJ Footwear Corp., and its base of operations changed to Franklin, Tennessee. In 2000, EJ Footwear was bought out by Citicorp Venture Capital Ltd., a subsidiary of Citigroup. Finally, on December 6, 2004, EJ Footwear agreed to be acquired by Rocky Shoes & Boots, Inc. EJ had previously been the sole licensee for Rocky's \\"Dickies\\" line of work footwear. According to its 2005 annual report, Rocky's sales more than doubled over 2004, largely reflecting this acquisition.  Present day  The former central headquarters, located on the eastern edge of Johnson City, has been converted into a church. Most of the company's factories have been torn down, with the majority of the remaining facilities vacant, except for some that are partially occupied by area businesses. EJ Footwear, LLC persists as a subsidiary of Rocky, but all its manufacturing is outsourced. A number of its former Johnson City manufacturing facilities are included in the Johnson City Historic District, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. In addition, the former Endicott-Johnson Medical Clinic at Binghamton and West Endicott Hose Company No. 1 at West Endicott are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the autumn of 2016, New York State Homes & Community Renewal entered into a development agreement with Affordable Housing Concepts and Libolt Construction to gut rehabilitate the former Sunrise and Century buildings into a pair of affordable housing sites. Utilizing a combination of bond financing, historic tax credits, funding from the Johnson City and developer equity, construction commenced in the spring of 2017 and is expected to continue into 2018. The completed buildings will provide more than 80 affordable multi-bedroom apartments, and portions of the ground floors will be converted for commercial use. Additionally, the site will include a small museum displaying artifacts discovered during the construction, including machinery, signage, worker timecards and what is believed to be the first elevator car specifically designed to a maximum weight capacity E-J Sunrise Plant, Johnson City View of the E-J Victory Factory building, from 2009.

Contribution to economy  The company was responsible for nearly all of the shoe and footwear for the United States Army during World War I and World War II. At its peak, E-J was one of the largest shoe manufacturers in the U.S., with retail outlets in over 30 states. E-J was also substantially vertically integrated, with coal-fired steam generating plants to power factory machinery, and factories for tanning animal hides to make leather and for reclaiming rubber from used automobile tires for use as shoe soles. 77x77px But E-J's most long lasting and important economic contribution may be its influence on its neighbor in Endicott, New York: International Business Machines Corporation (now \\"IBM\\") and IBM's predecessors in Endicott the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company and (before that) The Bundy Manufacturing Co. IBM, due at least in part to the influence of E-J's example, became one of the earliest and most important providers of employee benefits. Although they did not provide free medical and hospital care or build houses for employees they recognized that good pay and benefits were key to remaining non-union. In recent years IBM has significantly reduced their benefit programs for employees and retirees. In the 1976 film Taxi Driver, an ad for the Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company can be seen painted on a wall while Travis is slowly following Iris.  Carousel Capital of the World  George F. Johnson donated six carousels to the Triple Cities between 1919 and 1934, which are now among the fewer than 170 antique carousels remaining in the United States and Canada. All were built by the well-known carousel maker Allan Herschell (of The Herschell Carrousel Factory in North Tonawanda, New York), all contain wood-carved figures, and all are still working during the summer months subject to weather and restoration projects. Binghamton is accordingly associated with the nickname \\"Carousel Capital of the World,\\" although only two of the Triple Cities' six carousels are in Binghamton. The admission price to the carousels has never changed: free (except, traditionally, to find and dispose of one piece of litter). The Highland Park Carousel, C. Fred Johnson Park Carousel, George F. Johnson Recreation Park Carousel, George W. Johnson Park Carousel, Ross Park Carousel, and West Endicott Park Carousel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Lake ecosystems are a prime example of lentic ecosystems. Lentic refers to stationary or relatively still water, from the Latin lentus, which means sluggish. Lentic waters range from ponds to lakes to wetlands, and much of this article applies to lentic ecosystems in general. Lentic ecosystems can be compared with lotic ecosystems, which involve flowing terrestrial waters such as rivers and streams. Together, these two fields form the more general study area of freshwater or aquatic ecology. Lentic systems are diverse, ranging from a small, temporary rainwater pool a few inches deep to Lake Baikal, which has a maximum depth of 1642 m. The general distinction between pools/ponds and lakes is vague, but Brown states that ponds and pools have their entire bottom surfaces exposed to light, while lakes do not. In addition, some lakes become seasonally stratified (discussed in more detail below.) Ponds and pools have two regions: the pelagic open water zone, and the benthic zone, which comprises the bottom and shore regions. Since lakes have deep bottom regions not exposed to light, these systems have an additional zone, the profundal. These three areas can have very different abiotic conditions and, hence, host species that are specifically adapted to live there. Important abiotic factors Light Light provides the solar energy required to drive the process of photosynthesis, the major energy source of lentic systems. The amount of light received depends upon a combination of several factors. Small ponds may experience shading by surrounding trees, while cloud cover may affect light availability in all systems, regardless of size. Seasonal and diurnal considerations also play a role in light availability because the shallower the angle at which light strikes water, the more light is lost by reflection. This is known as Beer's law. Once light has penetrated the surface, it may also be scattered by particles suspended in the water column. This scattering decreases the total amount of light as depth increases. Lakes are divided into photic and aphotic regions, the prior receiving sunlight and latter being below the depths of light penetration, making it void of photosynthetic capacity. In relation to lake zonation, the pelagic and benthic zones are considered to lie within the photic region, while the profundal zone is in the aphotic region. Temperature Temperature is an important abiotic factor in lentic ecosystems because most of the biota are poikilothermic, where internal body temperatures are defined by the surrounding system. Water can be heated or cooled through radiation at the surface and conduction to or from the air and surrounding substrate. Shallow ponds often have a continuous temperature gradient from warmer waters at the surface to cooler waters at the bottom. In addition, temperature fluctuations can vary greatly in these systems, both diurnally and seasonally. Temperature regimes are very different in large lakes (Fig. 2). In temperate regions, for example, as air temperatures increase, the icy layer formed on the surface of the lake breaks up, leaving the water at approximately 4 ¬∞C. This is the temperature at which water has the highest density. As the season progresses, the warmer air temperatures heat the surface waters, making them less dense. The deeper waters remain cool and dense due to reduced light penetration. As the summer begins, two distinct layers become established, with such a large temperature difference between them that they remain stratified. The lowest zone in the lake is the coldest and is called the hypolimnion. The upper warm zone is called the epilimnion. Between these zones is a band of rapid temperature change called the thermocline. During the colder fall season, heat is lost at the surface and the epilimnion cools. When the temperatures of the two zones are close enough, the waters begin to mix again to create a uniform temperature, an event termed lake turnover. In the winter, inverse stratification occurs as water near the surface cools freezes, while warmer, but denser water remains near the bottom. A thermocline is established, and the cycle repeats. Fig. 2 Seasonal stratification in temperate lakes Wind Fig. 3 Illustration of Langmuir rotations; open circles=positively buoyant particles, closed circles=negatively buoyant particles In exposed systems, wind can create turbulent, spiral-formed surface currents called Langmuir circulations (Fig. 3). Exactly how these currents become established is still not well understood, but it is evident that it involves some interaction between horizontal surface currents and surface gravity waves. The visible result of these rotations, which can be seen in any lake, are the surface foamlines that run parallel to the wind direction. Positively buoyant particles and small organisms concentrate in the foamline at the surface and negatively buoyant objects are found in the upwelling current between the two rotations. Objects with neutral buoyancy tend to be evenly distributed in the water column. This turbulence circulates nutrients in the water column, making it crucial for many pelagic species, however its effect on benthic and profundal organisms is minimal to non-existent, respectively. The degree of nutrient circulation is system specific, as it depends upon such factors as wind strength and duration, as well as lake or pool depth and productivity. Chemistry Oxygen is essential for organismal respiration. The amount of oxygen present in standing waters depends upon: 1) the area of transparent water exposed to the air, 2) the circulation of water within the system and 3) the amount of oxygen generated and used by organisms present. In shallow, plant-rich pools there may be great fluctuations of oxygen, with extremely high concentrations occurring during the day due to photosynthesis and very low values at night when respiration is the dominant process of primary producers. Thermal stratification in larger systems can also affect the amount of oxygen present in different zones. The epilimnion is oxygen rich because it circulates quickly, gaining oxygen via contact with the air. The hypolimnion, however, circulates very slowly and has no atmospheric contact. Additionally, fewer green plants exist in the hypolimnion, so there is less oxygen released from photosynthesis. In spring and fall when the epilimnion and hypolimnion mix, oxygen becomes more evenly distributed in the system. Low oxygen levels are characteristic of the profundal zone due to the accumulation of decaying vegetation and animal matter that ‚Äúrains‚Äù down from the pelagic and benthic zones and the inability to support primary producers. Phosphorus is important for all organisms because it is a component of DNA and RNA and is involved in cell metabolism as a component of ATP and ADP. Also, phosphorus is not found in large quantities in freshwater systems, limiting photosynthesis in primary producers, making it the main determinant of lentic system production. The phosphorus cycle is complex, but the model outlined below describes the basic pathways. Phosphorus mainly enters a pond or lake through runoff from the watershed or by atmospheric deposition. Upon entering the system, a reactive form of phosphorus is usually taken up by algae and macrophytes, which release a non-reactive phosphorus compound as a byproduct of photosynthesis. This phosphorus can drift downwards and become part of the benthic or profundal sediment, or it can be remineralized to the reactive form by microbes in the water column. Similarly, non-reactive phosphorus in the sediment can be remineralized into the reactive form. Sediments are generally richer in phosphorus than lake water, however, indicating that this nutrient may have a long residency time there before it is remineralized and re-introduced to the system. Lentic system biota Bacteria Bacteria are present in all regions of lentic waters. Free-living forms are associated with decomposing organic material, biofilm on the surfaces of rocks and plants, suspended in the water column, and in the sediments of the benthic and profundal zones. Other forms are also associated with the guts of lentic animals as parasites or in commensal relationships. Bacteria play an important role in system metabolism through nutrient recycling, which is discussed in the Trophic Relationships section. Primary producers Nelumbo nucifera, an aquatic plant. Algae, including both phytoplankton and periphyton, are the principle photosynthesizers in ponds and lakes. Phytoplankton are found drifting in the water column of the pelagic zone. Many species have a higher density than water, which should cause them to sink inadvertently down into the benthos. To combat this, phytoplankton have developed density-changing mechanisms, by forming vacuoles and gas vesicles, or by changing their shapes to induce drag, thus slowing their descent. A very sophisticated adaptation utilized by a small number of species is a tail-like flagellum that can adjust vertical position, and allow movement in any direction. Phytoplankton can also maintain their presence in the water column by being circulated in Langmuir rotations. Periphytic algae, on the other hand, are attached to a substrate. In lakes and ponds, they can cover all benthic surfaces. Both types of plankton are important as food sources and as oxygen providers. Aquatic plants live in both the benthic and pelagic zones, and can be grouped according to their manner of growth: ‚ë¥ emergent = rooted in the substrate, but with leaves and flowers extending into the air; ‚ëµ floating-leaved = rooted in the substrate, but with floating leaves; ‚ë∂ submersed = growing beneath the surface; ‚ë∑ free-floating macrophytes = not rooted in the substrate, and floating on the surface. These various forms of macrophytes generally occur in different areas of the benthic zone, with emergent vegetation nearest the shoreline, then floating-leaved macrophytes, followed by submersed vegetation. Free-floating macrophytes can occur anywhere on the system's surface. Aquatic plants are more buoyant than their terrestrial counterparts because freshwater has a higher density than air. This makes structural rigidity unimportant in lakes and ponds (except in the aerial stems and leaves). Thus, the leaves and stems of most aquatic plants use less energy to construct and maintain woody tissue, investing that energy into fast growth instead. In order to contend with stresses induced by the wind and waves, plants must be both flexible and tough. Light, water depth, and substrate types are the most important factors controlling the distribution of submerged aquatic plants.Keddy, P.A. (2010). Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. . Macrophytes are sources of food, oxygen, and habitat structure in the benthic zone, but cannot penetrate the depths of the euphotic zone, and hence are not found there. Invertebrates Water striders are predatory insects which rely on surface tension to walk on top of water. They live on the surface of ponds, marshes, and other quiet waters. They can move very quickly, up to 1.5 m/s. Zooplankton are tiny animals suspended in the water column. Like phytoplankton, these species have developed mechanisms that keep them from sinking to deeper waters, including drag-inducing body forms, and the active flicking of appendages (such as antennae or spines). Remaining in the water column may have its advantages in terms of feeding, but this zone's lack of refugia leaves zooplankton vulnerable to predation. In response, some species, especially Daphnia sp., make daily vertical migrations in the water column by passively sinking to the darker lower depths during the day, and actively moving towards the surface during the night. Also, because conditions in a lentic system can be quite variable across seasons, zooplankton have the ability to switch from laying regular eggs to resting eggs when there is a lack of food, temperatures fall below 2¬∞C, or if predator abundance is high. These resting eggs have a diapause, or dormancy period, that should allow the zooplankton to encounter conditions that are more favorable to survival when they finally hatch.Gliwicz, Z. M. \\"Zooplankton\\", pp. 461‚Äì516 in O'Sullivan (2005) The invertebrates that inhabit the benthic zone are numerically dominated by small species, and are species-rich compared to the zooplankton of the open water. They include: Crustaceans (e.g. crabs, crayfish, and shrimp), molluscs (e.g. clams and snails), and numerous types of insects. These organisms are mostly found in the areas of macrophyte growth, where the richest resources, highly-oxygenated water, and warmest portion of the ecosystem are found. The structurally diverse macrophyte beds are important sites for the accumulation of organic matter, and provide an ideal area for colonization. The sediments and plants also offer a great deal of protection from predatory fishes. Very few invertebrates are able to inhabit the cold, dark, and oxygen-poor profundal zone. Those that can are often red in color, due to the presence of large amounts of hemoglobin, which greatly increases the amount of oxygen carried to cells. Because the concentration of oxygen within this zone is low, most species construct tunnels or burrows in which they can hide, and utilize the minimum amount of movements necessary to circulate water through, drawing oxygen to them without expending too much energy. Fish and other vertebrates Fish have a range of physiological tolerances that are dependent upon which species they belong to. They have different lethal temperatures, dissolved oxygen requirements, and spawning needs that are based on their activity levels and behaviors. Because fish are highly mobile, they are able to deal with unsuitable abiotic factors in one zone by simply moving to another. A detrital feeder in the profundal zone, for example, that finds the oxygen concentration has dropped too low may feed closer to the benthic zone. A fish might also alter its residence during different parts of its life history: hatching in a sediment nest, then moving to the weedy benthic zone to develop in a protected environment with food resources, and finally into the pelagic zone as an adult. Other vertebrate taxa inhabit lentic systems as well. These include amphibians (e.g. salamanders and frogs), reptiles (e.g. snakes, turtles, and alligators), and a large number of waterfowl species. Most of these vertebrates spend part of their time in terrestrial habitats, and thus, are not directly affected by abiotic factors in the lake or pond. Many fish species are important both as consumers and as prey species to the larger vertebrates mentioned above. Trophic relationships Primary producers Lentic systems gain most of their energy from photosynthesis performed by aquatic plants and algae. This autochthonous process involves the combination of carbon dioxide, water, and solar energy to produce carbohydrates and dissolved oxygen. Within a lake or pond, the potential rate of photosynthesis generally decreases with depth due to light attenuation. Photosynthesis, however, is often low at the top few millimeters of the surface, likely due to inhibition by ultraviolet light. The exact depth and photosynthetic rate measurements of this curve are system specific and depend upon: 1) the total biomass of photosynthesizing cells, 2) the amount of light attenuating materials and 3) the abundance and frequency range of light absorbing pigments (i.e. chlorophylls) inside of photosynthesizing cells. The energy created by these primary producers is important for the community because it is transferred to higher trophic levels via consumption. Bacteria The vast majority of bacteria in lakes and ponds obtain their energy by decomposing vegetation and animal matter. In the pelagic zone, dead fish and the occasional allochthonous input of litterfall are examples of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM>1 mm). Bacteria degrade these into fine particulate organic matter (FPOM<1 mm) and then further into usable nutrients. Small organisms such as plankton are also characterized as FPOM. Very low concentrations of nutrients are released during decomposition because the bacteria are utilizing them to build their own biomass. Bacteria, however, are consumed by protozoa, which are in turn consumed by zooplankton, and then further up the trophic levels. Nutrients, including those that contain carbon and phosphorus, are reintroduced into the water column at any number of points along this food chain via excretion or organism death, making them available again for bacteria. This regeneration cycle is known as the microbial loop and is a key component of lentic food webs. The decomposition of organic materials can continue in the benthic and profundal zones if the matter falls through the water column before being completely digested by the pelagic bacteria. Bacteria are found in the greatest abundance here in sediments, where they are typically 2-1000 times more prevalent than in the water column. Benthic Invertebrates Benthic invertebrates, due to their high level of species richness, have many methods of prey capture. Filter feeders create currents via siphons or beating cilia, to pull water and its nutritional contents, towards themselves for straining. Grazers use scraping, rasping, and shredding adaptations to feed on periphytic algae and macrophytes. Members of the collector guild browse the sediments, picking out specific particles with raptorial appendages. Deposit feeding invertebrates indiscriminately consume sediment, digesting any organic material it contains. Finally, some invertebrates belong to the predator guild, capturing and consuming living animals.J√≥nasson, P. M. \\"Benthic Invertebrates\\", pp. 341‚Äì416 in O'Sullivan (2005) The profundal zone is home to a unique group of filter feeders that use small body movements to draw a current through burrows that they have created in the sediment. This mode of feeding requires the least amount of motion, allowing these species to conserve energy. A small number of invertebrate taxa are predators in the profundal zone. These species are likely from other regions and only come to these depths to feed. The vast majority of invertebrates in this zone are deposit feeders, getting their energy from the surrounding sediments. Fish Fish size, mobility, and sensory capabilities allow them to exploit a broad prey base, covering multiple zonation regions. Like invertebrates, fish feeding habits can be categorized into guilds. In the pelagic zone, herbivores graze on periphyton and macrophytes or pick phytoplankton out of the water column. Carnivores include fishes that feed on zooplankton in the water column (zooplanktivores), insects at the water's surface, on benthic structures, or in the sediment (insectivores), and those that feed on other fish (piscivores). Fish that consume detritus and gain energy by processing its organic material are called detritivores. Omnivores ingest a wide variety of prey, encompassing floral, faunal, and detrital material. Finally, members of the parasitic guild acquire nutrition from a host species, usually another fish or large vertebrate. Fish taxa are flexible in their feeding roles, varying their diets with environmental conditions and prey availability. Many species also undergo a diet shift as they develop. Therefore, it is likely that any single fish occupies multiple feeding guilds within its lifetime.Winfield, I. J. \\"Fish Population Ecology\\", pp. 517‚Äì537 in O'Sullivan (2005) Lentic food webs As noted in the previous sections, the lentic biota are linked in complex web of trophic relationships. These organisms can be considered to loosely be associated with specific trophic groups (e.g. primary producers, herbivores, primary carnivores, secondary carnivores, etc.). Scientists have developed several theories in order to understand the mechanisms that control the abundance and diversity within these groups. Very generally, top-down processes dictate that the abundance of prey taxa is dependent upon the actions of consumers from higher trophic levels. Typically, these processes operate only between two trophic levels, with no effect on the others. In some cases, however, aquatic systems experience a trophic cascade; for example, this might occur if primary producers experience less grazing by herbivores because these herbivores are suppressed by carnivores. Bottom-up processes are functioning when the abundance or diversity of members of higher trophic levels is dependent upon the availability or quality of resources from lower levels. Finally, a combined regulating theory, bottom-up:top-down, combines the predicted influences of consumers and resource availability. It predicts that trophic levels close to the lowest trophic levels will be most influenced by bottom-up forces, while top-down effects should be strongest at top levels. Community patterns and diversity Local species richness The biodiversity of a lentic system increases with the surface area of the lake or pond. This is attributable to the higher likelihood of partly terrestrial species of finding a larger system. Also, because larger systems typically have larger populations, the chance of extinction is decreased. Additional factors, including temperature regime, pH, nutrient availability, habitat complexity, speciation rates, competition, and predation, have been linked to the number of species present within systems. Succession patterns in plankton communities ‚Äì the PEG model Phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in lake systems undergo seasonal succession in relation to nutrient availability, predation, and competition. Sommer et al. described these patterns as part of the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model, with 24 statements constructed from the analysis of numerous systems. The following includes a subset of these statements, as explained by Br√∂nmark and Hansson illustrating succession through a single seasonal cycle: Winter 1\\\\. Increased nutrient and light availability result in rapid phytoplankton growth towards the end of winter. The dominant species, such as diatoms, are small and have quick growth capabilities. 2\\\\. These plankton are consumed by zooplankton, which become the dominant plankton taxa. Spring 3\\\\. A clear water phase occurs, as phytoplankton populations become depleted due to increased predation by growing numbers of zooplankton. Summer 4\\\\. Zooplankton abundance declines as a result of decreased phytoplankton prey and increased predation by juvenile fishes. 5\\\\. With increased nutrient availability and decreased predation from zooplankton, a diverse phytoplankton community develops. 6\\\\. As the summer continues, nutrients become depleted in a predictable order: phosphorus, silica, and then nitrogen. The abundance of various phytoplankton species varies in relation to their biological need for these nutrients. 7\\\\. Small-sized zooplankton become the dominant type of zooplankton because they are less vulnerable to fish predation. Fall 8\\\\. Predation by fishes is reduced due to lower temperatures and zooplankton of all sizes increase in number. Winter 9\\\\. Cold temperatures and decreased light availability result in lower rates of primary production and decreased phytoplankton populations. 10\\\\. Reproduction in zooplankton decreases due to lower temperatures and less prey. The PEG model presents an idealized version of this succession pattern, while natural systems are known for their variation. Latitudinal patterns There is a well-documented global pattern that correlates decreasing plant and animal diversity with increasing latitude, that is to say, there are fewer species as one moves towards the poles. The cause of this pattern is one of the greatest puzzles for ecologists today. Theories for its explanation include energy availability, climatic variability, disturbance, competition, etc. Despite this global diversity gradient, this pattern can be weak for freshwater systems compared to global marine and terrestrial systems. This may be related to size, as Hillebrand and Azovsky found that smaller organisms (protozoa and plankton) did not follow the expected trend strongly, while larger species (vertebrates) did. They attributed this to better dispersal ability by smaller organisms, which may result in high distributions globally. Natural lake lifecycles Lake creation Lakes can be formed in a variety of ways, but the most common are discussed briefly below. The oldest and largest systems are the result of tectonic activities. The rift lakes in Africa, for example are the result of seismic activity along the site of separation of two tectonic plates. Ice-formed lakes are created when glaciers recede, leaving behind abnormalities in the landscape shape that are then filled with water. Finally, oxbow lakes are fluvial in origin, resulting when a meandering river bend is pinched off from the main channel. Natural extinction All lakes and ponds receive sediment inputs. Since these systems are not really expanding, it is logical to assume that they will become increasingly shallower in depth, eventually becoming wetlands or terrestrial vegetation. The length of this process should depend upon a combination of depth and sedimentation rate. Moss gives the example of Lake Tanganyika, which reaches a depth of 1500 m and has a sedimentation rate of 0.5 mm/yr. Assuming that sedimentation is not influenced by anthropogenic factors, this system should go extinct in approximately 3 million years. Shallow lentic systems might also fill in as swamps encroach inward from the edges. These processes operate on a much shorter timescale, taking hundreds to thousands of years to complete the extinction process. Human impacts Acidification Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are naturally released from volcanoes, organic compounds in the soil, wetlands, and marine systems, but the majority of these compounds come from the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, and the smelting of ores containing sulfur. These substances dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lentic systems as acid rain. Lakes and ponds that contain bedrock that is rich in carbonates have a natural buffer, resulting in no alteration of pH. Systems without this bedrock, however, are very sensitive to acid inputs because they have a low neutralizing capacity, resulting in pH declines even with only small inputs of acid. At a pH of 5‚Äì6 algal species diversity and biomass decrease considerably, leading to an increase in water transparency ‚Äì a characteristic feature of acidified lakes. As the pH continues lower, all fauna becomes less diverse. The most significant feature is the disruption of fish reproduction. Thus, the population is eventually composed of few, old individuals that eventually die and leave the systems without fishes. Acid rain has been especially harmful to lakes in Scandinavia, western Scotland, west Wales and the north eastern United States. Eutrophication Eutrophic systems contain a high concentration of phosphorus (~30 ¬µg/L), nitrogen (~1500 ¬µg/L), or both. Phosphorus enters lentic waters from sewage treatment effluents, discharge from raw sewage, or from runoff of farmland. Nitrogen mostly comes from agricultural fertilizers from runoff or leaching and subsequent groundwater flow. This increase in nutrients required for primary producers results in a massive increase of phytoplankton growth, termed a \\"plankton bloom.\\" This bloom decreases water transparency, leading to the loss of submerged plants. The resultant reduction in habitat structure has negative impacts on the species that utilize it for spawning, maturation, and general survival. Additionally, the large number of short-lived phytoplankton result in a massive amount of dead biomass settling into the sediment. Bacteria need large amounts of oxygen to decompose this material, thus reducing the oxygen concentration of the water. This is especially pronounced in stratified lakes, when the thermocline prevents oxygen-rich water from the surface to mix with lower levels. Low or anoxic conditions preclude the existence of many taxa that are not physiologically tolerant of these conditions. Invasive species Invasive species have been introduced to lentic systems through both purposeful events (e.g. stocking game and food species) as well as unintentional events (e.g. in ballast water). These organisms can affect natives via competition for prey or habitat, predation, habitat alteration, hybridization, or the introduction of harmful diseases and parasites. With regard to native species, invaders may cause changes in size and age structure, distribution, density, population growth, and may even drive populations to extinction. Examples of prominent invaders of lentic systems include the zebra mussel and sea lamprey in the Great Lakes.

Marford covers some , where the hills of north-east Wales meet the Cheshire Plain. Distant landmarks that can be seen clearly from Marford include Eaton Hall, Chester Town Hall and Cathedral. Beyond that on the Cheshire plains, Peckforton Castle and its hills form the skyline, with the outcrop of rock at Beeston Castle. History Marford was formerly always pronounced and spelt Merford, and continued to be written as such on the township rate books until 1804.Palmer, A. N. A History of Ancient Tenures of Land in North Wales..., 1910, p.128 The name is English in origin, and may mean either the \\"ford of the mere\\", or refer to \\"mere\\" in its alternative sense of \\"boundary\\". The Rofft was the site of an Iron Age hill fort and later a motte and bailey castle. Due to the history of the Rofft no physical remains are visible at the site. At the time of Domesday Merford was part of the English county of Chester, although it soon after became part of the Welsh kingdom of Powys Fadog.Palmer, p.44 It returned to English administration in 1282, becoming under the manorial system part of Merford commote of the Lordship of Bromfield. It once formed a small enclave of Flintshire completely surrounded by Denbighshire. As the parish of \\"Marford and Hoseley\\" this status continued until the creation of the county of Clwyd in 1974. Formerly in the ancient parish of Gresford, in 1840 the township of Marford and Hoseley became part of the newly formed parish of Rossett.Gresford, All Saints, GENUKI A detached part of Marford (or Merford) township lay in neighbouring Rossett, next to the bridge over the River Alyn, until 1884.Palmer, p.69 This contained the Marford and Hoseley tenants' mill, with the result that the building often known today as Rossett Mill is still confusingly, though more correctly, referred to as Marford Mill. The rural area to the south-east of Marford was historically known as Hoseley. It was originally a separate township, and was recorded in the Domesday book as \\"Odeslei\\" and later as \\"Hodeslei\\", meaning Oda or Hoda's lea (meadow).Palmer, p.139, 237 The name is still attached to several farms, roads and other features. There was an adjacent estate known as Horsley (\\"horse-pasture\\"), which is sometimes confused with Hoseley, although the names have different origins.Palmer, p.139, 237 Architecture Marford is best known for its quaint looking Gothic revival cottages, built as part of the former Trevalyn Hall estates: the style is also called cottage orn√©.Cottage orn√© , Conservation Glossary, University of Dundee It has been described as \\"a delightful Gothick estate village\\"Beazley & Howell, The companion guide to North Wales, Collins, 1975, p.61 and several of its cottages have been listed by Cadw. Although a few are earlier, most were built at the end of the 18th until the beginning of the 19th centuries by George Boscawen, whose wife had inherited the estate.Marford's Gothic Cottages , Chester Chronicle, 16-02-09 Originally the buildings were roofed in thatch, but were soon re-roofed in Bwlch yr Oernant slate, although some retain the distinctive roof lines of formerly thatched buildings. Many of Marford's houses feature crosses built into the design. A local folk tale states that these were included to protect the inhabitants from a ghost, supposedly the spirit of Margaret Blackbourne of Rofft Hall, who was said to have been murdered in September 1713 by her husband George Blackbourne, the steward of the Trevalyn estate.Holland, R. Supernatural Clwyd: the folk tales of North- East Wales, Gwasg Carreg Gwalch, 1989, pp.195‚Äì196. George Blackbourne, also spelt Blackborne, is recorded as having been buried at Gresford on November 4, 1725, leaving two children by his first wife and two by his second wife (see Archaeologia Cambrensis, 1904, 306‚Äì308). The original story having become garbled over the years, the ghost of Marford is often now referred to as \\"Lady Blackbird\\", and is said to tap at windows in the village.Holland, p.196 Today Although still largely surrounded by farmland, Marford is now partly contiguous with the larger village of Gresford to the south-west, and forms part of the community of Gresford for local administration purposes. Marford and Hoseley is still, however, a separate ward of Wrexham County Borough, having a population of 2,458 at the 2001 census.Marford and Hoseley Ward, Wrexham County Borough Council There are two public houses in Marford, one at the bottom of the Marford hill ‚Äì The Trevor Arms (its name referencing the landowning family of Trevalyn Hall, the Trevors) ‚Äì and the other at the top, The Red Lion.

The fortress was important in guarding the southern border of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the case of a Crimean Tatar raid along the Muravsky Trail. Thirty years later, Ivan the Terrible sent prince Masalsky to build a town of Livny under the umbrella of a garrison stationed in the fort. It was pillaged and burnt by the Tatars on many occasions. In 1606, the citizens of Livny raised a rebellion against Boris Godunov, killing his governor and proclaiming their allegiance to False Dmitry I. Two years later, Ivan Bolotnikov chose it as a base of his military operations against Vasily IV. In 1618, the wooden town was burnt by the Cossacks of Petro Konashevych. The Crimeans again attacked the town in 1661, burning it to the ground. As soon as the Tatar attacks ceased, the period of prosperity was ushered. In the 19th century, Livny rivaled Yelets as the main trade center of the area. During World War II, Livny was occupied by the German Army from 26 November to 25 December 1941.

The state highway also connects those cities with the Radford Army Ammunition Plant. Route description View west along SR 114 just east of US 460 Bus. in Christiansburg SR 114 begins at an intersection with US 11 (Lee Highway) in Fairlawn, a community in Pulaski County across the New River from the city of Radford. The state highway heads east as a five-lane road with center turn lane through a commercial area. East of the commercial area, SR 114 becomes a four-lane divided highway for a short distance before the westbound direction veers onto the eastbound carriageway. The state highway continues east as a two-lane two- way road on the southern of two carriageways; the northern carriageway is unused. SR 114 continues in this formation to the New River, where the two- lane highway crosses the river closely paralleled by a closed through truss bridge to the north. Once in Montgomery County, the state highway crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's Christiansburg District. The westbound carriageway becomes used again just west of the entrance to the Radford Army Ammunition Plant in Centerville. SR 114 continues east as a two-lane road on a single carriageway that passes through farmland to the south of Price Mountain on its way to the town of Christiansburg. The state highway intersects the Huckleberry Trail, a rail trail, to the south of the New River Valley Mall before intersecting US 460 Business (Franklin Street). There, SR 114 expands to a six-lane divided highway that passes through a commercial area between the business route and the partial cloverleaf interchange with US 460 that serves as the highway's eastern terminus. Peppers Ferry Road continues east as a divided highway for a short distance beyond the easternmost ramps of the interchange before curving north as two-lane Cinnabar Road, which serves as a frontage road for US 460.

It was renumbered State Route 89 in the 1933 Virginia state highway renumbering, and was transferred to the secondary system in 1938 at the request of Wythe County. History of the current Route 114 The current State Route 114 had its origins in the 1933 Virginia state highway renumbering but none of the current path of VA 114 was part of the original 1933 route. Instead a series of extensions and truncations of VA 114 have given it its present alignment. Prior to 1933, Route 114 was numbered Route 209. left State Route 209 first appeared in August 1928 as new primary routing beginning at US 11 in Cloverdale running to Daleville and then northwest through Catawba to the Montgomery County line towards Blacksburg. In June 1930, a second piece of VA 209 was added from what was then VA 23 (now Business US 460) in Blacksburg east for 2.4 miles. In December 1930, the original 1928 section was extended west 4.8 miles further towards Blacksburg. VA 209 was also extended west from Blacksburg along Turner Street and Prices Fork Road for 1.46 miles. In July 1932, the two sections were connected east of Blacksburg and the Prices Fork Road section was extended west past Linkous Store. Also in July 1932, a new piece was created replacing CR 113 running north from VA 10 (now Bonsack Road near US 221/US 460) less than a mile to the Botetourt County line. In July 1933, all parts of VA 209 were renumbered as Route 114. The road was gradually paved throughout the 1930s and 40s. There were also many changes to the route in this period. In May 1938, VA 114 was extended west to US 11 in Fairlawn, an upgrade of SR 604. In April 1944, the separate section at Bonsack was downgraded to SR 604 (now US 220 Alternate). In May 1945, the VA 114 designation west of Blacksburg was removed from Prices Fork Road. That road became SR 658 and is now VA 412, SR 685, and a route in the Radford Arsenal. VA 114 was then routed south on VA 8 (now Business US 460) to just east of Belmont, where it went west on Peppers Ferry Rd (previously SR 658). At the same time, VA 114 was truncated in the east VA 311 near Catawba, with the former route downgraded to SR 779. In May 1950, all of VA 114 east of US 460 was eliminated, replaced by SR 785 from Blacksburg to Catawba. VA 114 maintained its Fairlawn to Belmont path unchanged for over 50 years until it was extended east to an interchange on the new US 460 bypass. While this new section is multilane, much of the road remains two lanes.

The parish includes the hamlets of Farleigh Wick and Pinckney Green. In the west and northwest the parish is bounded by Somerset. It is known for its underground mines of Bath Stone, which were converted into one of the largest Ministry of Defence underground ammunition stores in the country.  History  The Roman road from Silchester to Bath, and later earthworks which may be part of Wansdyke, run east-west and form the northern boundary of the modern parish. Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a settlement of 24 households, and land held by Brictric and his brother Alwy. The manor passed to the Bohun family, and was held by Humphrey I de Bohun around 1120. The Bohuns founded the Priory of St Mary Magdalene thereafter, and it had a church by c.1150. In the early 13th century the priory was rebuilt with a larger church; in 1294 the population of the manor, including the monks, was around 200. The priory was dissolved in 1536 and parts of its buildings were incorporated into Monkton Farleigh Manor. In the 19th century, quarrying for Bath stone became the main source of employment in the parish. The manor house and some land was bought in 1873 by Sir Charles Hobhouse, whose history of the parish was published in the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine in 1881. His son, also Charles, lived at the manor house until his death in 1941. A National School was built in the 1870s, replacing earlier small schools, and by 1881 had an average attendance of 67. A new school with teacher's house was built in 1886. Children of all ages attended until 1930, when those over 11 transferred to the secondary school at Bradford on Avon. By 2005, numbers had fallen to 24 and the following year the school merged with the village school at Atworth, which continues on both sites as Churchfields School. Landmarks The civil parish has 34 listed buildings, including: * Monkton Farleigh Manor (Grade I) * remains of the refectory at Monkton Farleigh Manor (Grade I ruin) * Church of St. Peter (Grade II*) Woodland at Inwood is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest.Site details, Natural England  Parish church  St Peter's Church The parish church of St Peter was rebuilt by T.H. Wyatt in 1844, although the west tower may be from the 12th or 13th centuries. There was further restoration in 1874. A doorway in the north wall of the nave has an arch and shafts from the 12th century, with a 15th-century door inserted. A single-storey addition on the south side was built in 1829 as a Sunday school and is now used as a vestry. The octagonal pulpit and the communion table are from the 17th century, and there is stained glass from the 1860s, 1870s and 1905. The three bells in the tower, from the 18th and 19th centuries, are said to be unringable. The church was recorded as Grade II* listed in 1962. Today the church is part of the Benefice of North Bradford-on-Avon and Villages, alongside St James at South Wraxall, St Nicholas at Winsley and Christ Church at Bradford-on-Avon. CAD Monkton Farleigh District 20 of the depot, showing the conveyor for moving munitions In the 1930s, it was recognised that there was a need to provide secure storage for munitions across the United Kingdom. The proposal was to create three Central Ammunition Depots (CADs): one in the north (Longtown, Cumbria); one in the Midlands (Nesscliffe, Shropshire); and one in the south, namely CAD Monkton Farleigh, which was also known as CAD Corsham. The easily hewn Bath stone, a form of limestone, had created a number of large, horizontal, and relatively dry quarries around Corsham. Monkton Farleigh quarry was renovated from the late 1930s by the Royal Engineers as one of the three major depots. In November 1937 the Great Western Railway were contracted to build a long raised twin-loading platform at Shockerwick, between Box and Batheaston, with two sidings from the adjacent Bristol-London mainline branching off just outside the eastern entrance to the Box Tunnel at . below and at right angles to this point, the War Office had built a narrow gauge wagon sorting yard. This was attached by a tunnel built by The Cementation Company, descending at a rate of 1:8.5 to the Central Ammunition Depot, housed in the former mine workings. The whole logistics operation was designed to cope with a maximum of of ammunition a day. The narrow gauge trucks would descend from the platform to the tunnel, where a heavy-duty conveyor belt would propel the ammunition directly to the appropriate storage gallery. At any given time the depot was either taking in ammunition or sending it out, never both simultaneously. The construction design meant that an explosive accident or detonation inside any one of the stores would not propagate throughout the ammunition storehouse. The conveyor belt, and the original cable-way used as a temporary installation while the tunnel was being built, ran continuously for 30 days in the run-up to D-Day. CAD Monkton Farleigh closed at the end of hostilities, although was kept in an operational condition until the 1950s. The sidings were then cleared, and not used again until the mid-1980s when a museum opened for a short period on the site. Today the north end of the tunnel is sealed by a concrete and rubble installation, while the former mine/CAD is used for secure commercial document storage.

It is one of the five \\"Snow Leopard Peaks\\" in the territory of the former Soviet Union. It is named after Evgenia Korzhenevskaya, the wife of Russian geographer Nikolai L. Korzhenevskiy, who discovered the peak in August 1910. Due to transliteration and declension issues the peak's name is rendered in many different ways, including Korzhenevski, Korzhenevskoi, and Korzhenievsky.  Location Peak Korzhenevskaya lies about north of Ismoil Somoni Peak (formerly Communism Peak), the highest point of the Pamirs. It forms the end of the northwest fork of the Academy of Sciences Range, the north‚Äìsouth trending subrange which forms the core of the Pamirs. It rises on the south bank of the Muksu River, and to the west of the peak is the Fortambek Glacier. While most of the Academy of Sciences Range is in Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province (GBAO), Korzhenevskoi is located a little to the west of the GBAO line, in Jirgatol district (Region of Republican Subordination). Notable features Korzhenevskoi Peak is one of the five 7,000 m peaks of the former Soviet Union (this counts Khan Tengri, which is more often given as 6,995 m) that were required for a climber to be awarded the Snow Leopard award, the highest honor given to Soviet mountaineers. It is usually said to be the second easiest of these peaks to climb, after Lenin Peak. However it is not a small mountain; its rise above local terrain rivals that of Ismoil Somoni Peak, since it is closer to the deep valley of the Muksu River. Climbing history Descent from Korzhenevskaya. Jaan K√ºnnap. In 1937 D. Gushchin led an attempt on the peak which reached the lower summit (6,910 m). Korzhenevskoi Peak was first climbed in 1953 by a party led by A. Ugarov; the summit team comprised Ugarov, B. Dimitriev, A. Goziev, A. Kovyrkov, L. Krasavin, E. Ryspajev, R. Sielidzanov, and P. Skorobogatov. They approached via the Fortambek Glacier, to the Korzhenevsky glacier, and thence to the north ridge. Partly since it is required for the Snow Leopard award, Korzhenevskoi Peak has been climbed many times; it is the second most frequented major peak in the Pamirs, after Lenin Peak. A base camp on the moraine of the Moskvin Glacier, and helicopter access, make this possible. Korzhenevskoi Peak has been climbed from almost every direction, including a first winter ascent in 1987 by Anatoly Nosov; most of these ascents were by Russians. The most common current route on the mountain ascends from the south and attains the summit ridge from the west side.

Population: 52,242 (2002 Census); 68,652 (1989 Census). Name The name of the town derives from Akkala S√°mi word monce 'beautiful'. The name originally was intended for nearby Montshatuntur (Arctic Hill). History It was established in the 1930s as the inhabited locality of Moncha-Guba (), which served copper and nickel mining in the Monchetundra Massif.Administrative- Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 49 It was granted work settlement status and renamed Monchegorsk by the Resolution of the Presidium of All- Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) on November 25, 1935. At the same time, it was transferred from Kolsky District to Kirovsky District. By 1937, the copper-nickel mining volume increased significantly, and, consequently, the area population grew as well.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 51‚Äì54 On February 19, 1937, the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee petitioned to create new Monchegorsky District by separating the town and its surrounding area from Kirovsky District and to grant Monchegorsk town status. As a result, town status was granted to Monchegorsk by the VTsIK Resolution of September 20, 1937, although no new district was formed. On October 10, 1937, Monchegorsk town council was subordinated directly to the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee. On December 21, 1937, the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee again petitioned to create a new district with the administrative center in Monchegorsk. In a letter to the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee and the VTsIK, the Presidium noted that Kirovsky District has two developed but unrelated industrial centers‚ÄîKirovsk and Monchegorsk‚Äîwith the latter having a larger population and being located away from the former. The petition was again unsuccessful‚Äîwhen on February 10, 1938 the VTsIK adopted a new Resolution changing the administrative-territorial structure of Leningrad Oblast (of which Murmansk Okrug was a part), Monchegorsk remained a part of Kirovsky District. Monchegorsky District was eventually formed on December 27, 1938. It existed until December 9, 1949, when by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Monchegorsk was elevated in status to that of a town under oblast jurisdiction, with the former district's territory passing into its subordination. By the August 10, 1981 Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR Decree, the town of Olenegorsk was elevated in status to that of a town under oblast jurisdiction and subsequently several inhabited localities previously subordinated to Monchegorsk were transferred to Olenegorsk by the August 26, 1981 Decision of the Murmansk Oblast Executive Committee.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 57 Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with three rural localities, incorporated as Monchegorsk Town with Jurisdictional Territory‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #96-01-ZMO As a municipal division, Monchegorsk Town with Jurisdictional Territory is incorporated as Monchegorsk Urban Okrug.Law #536-01-ZMO Economy Nickel and copper producing factories in Monchegorsk Monchegorsk is a center of nickel cobalt and copper production (a Norilsk Nickel plant is located here).

It was first mentioned in 1227 and belonged to the Heiligenberg monastery. It is a Protestant church today. St. Bartholomew Church in Bruchhausen was completed in 1901. In the steeple hangs a bronze bell that was cast during the Thirty Years War (1618‚Äì1648) and was used in the previous church for over 200 years. Mills Behlmer Mill: The Behlmer mill is an octagonal two-story structure in the Dutch-style, built in 1876 by the master miller Heusmann. In 1934 it was rebuilt after being severely damaged by a tornado and in 1988, the mill was completely renovated. In addition to the mill are a loom and other farm equipment open to the public. Martfeld Mill: The Martfeld mill was first mentioned in the year 1583. Originally built as a block windmill, in 1840 it was rebuilt in three story Dutch-style. The mill burned to the ground after a lightning strike in 1851 and was rebuilt the same year. Between 1992 and 1999 the mill was completely renovated. The mill is the oldest windmill in the area. Fehsenfeldsche Mill: Built in 1871 in the three story Dutch-style, the mill operated until 1971. In 1991 the mill was restored and is now used for weddings. Sprakener Windmill: The Sprakener windmill was erected in 1856 in the three story Dutch-style and was in commercial operation until 1960. An exterior restoration was accomplished between 1991 and 1994, and there are plans to renovate the interior in the coming years. Heiligenberg Monastery Mill: First mention in 1370, the mill and the monastery came under state ownership in 1543. In 1986 the mill was restored and construction in 1996 opened a restaurant and a hotel with a gallery space in the mill. Bruchm√ºhlen Watermill: The Bruchm√ºhlen Watermill was the lower mill of the Heiligenberg Monastery. It is located a few hundred meters from the upper mill. Mentioned for the first time in the year 1532, creation of a massive ground work and the repair of the mill house was undertaken in 1749. Since 1886 the mill has been privately owned by the H√ºneke family. Water was restored to the mill in 1990/1991, and starting in the spring of 1996, roughly 3 tons per day of cereal was being ground. Noltesche mill: The Noltesche mill at S√ºstedter Bach was built as a grain mill in 1880, and three years later equipped with a turbine. In 1997 the mill became the property of the S√ºstedt municipality and restoration was completed in 1999. Since 1998, the turbine has been used for power generation.

He apprenticed with photojournalist Elliot Elisofen and later worked as an assistant to Louise Dahl-Wolfe. Greene eventually began his own career and, at the age of twenty-three, became known as the \\"Color Photography's Wonder Boy\\". Career Greene initially established himself in high fashion photography in the 1940s and 1950s. His fashion shots appeared in Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. Greene then turned to portraits of celebrities. He photographed many high-profile personalities in the 1950s and 1960s, including Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Ava Gardner, Sammy Davis, Jr., Catherine Deneuve, Marlene Dietrich, and Judy Garland. Greene's work with Marilyn Monroe (whom he first shot for a layout for Look in 1953) changed the course of his career. The two struck up a friendship and, when Monroe left Los Angeles to study acting with Lee Strasberg in New York City, she stayed with Greene, his wife Amy and young son Joshua in Connecticut.\\"Marilyn Monroe was my babysitter\\" - July 22, 2012 Together with Greene, Monroe formed Marilyn Monroe Productions, a production company in an effort to gain control of her career (from Hollywood powerhouses). Greene would go on to produce Bus Stop (1956) and The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). The two also collaborated on some 53 photo sessions, some of which became well known, including \\"The Black Sitting\\". Greene's photograph for one such sitting in 1954 featuring Monroe in a ballet tutu was chosen by Time Life as one of the three most popular images of the 20th century. Monroe and Greene's friendship ended after the production of The Prince and the Showgirl in 1957, and Monroe fired Greene. Personal life Greene's first marriage was to his childhood sweetheart Evelyn Franklin in 1942. They divorced in 1949. His second marriage was to model Amy Franco (born 1929 in Cuba), whom he married in 1953. They had two sons, Joshua and Anthony. They remained married until Greene's death in 1985. Death August 8, 1985, Greene died of lymphoma at a Los Angeles hospital at the age of 63. His ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean by his family.

The character first appears in The Amazing Spider- Man #419 (January 1997), and makes his first full appearance in Amazing Spider-Man #432 (March 1998). Black Tarantula was created by writer Tom DeFalco and artist Steve Skroce. Fictional character biography The origin of the Black Tarantula is shrouded in mystery and misinformation. There is a legend that the Black Tarantula was a European explorer, who traveled to Japan several centuries ago and was trained by the ninja clan called the Hand. At the end of the training he was awarded with a special potion that gave him superhuman powers and immortality. In reality, the Black Tarantula's immortality has a more earthly origin: the title is inherited from father to son, all posing as the same person (reminiscent of the comic strip character the Phantom). Though not truly immortal, the Black Tarantula possesses a multitude of superhuman powers as a result of the potion his ancestor drank. The current Black Tarantula moves his base of operations from Argentina to New York, claiming that he wants to expand his operation. He comes into conflict with the local crime lord the Rose (Jacob Conover), and defeats the Rose's enforcer, Delilah, though he heals her severe injuries afterwards. The Black Tarantula hires Roughouse and Bloodscream to do his dirty work and drives back the Rose, establishing control over a large part of New York City. When the Rose goes to Don Fortunato, a powerful crimelord ruling over New York City, for help, the Black Tarantula appears in person and offers Fortunato an alliance. Fortunato accepts, but the Black Tarantula has to prove his loyalty by defeating Spider-Man and bringing back his mask. Black Tarantula did as he was asked and defeated Spider-Man‚Äînot even caring who Spider-Man was under the mask‚Äîbut lets him live when he learns that Spider-Man was trying to rescue a small child.The Amazing Spider-Man #419. Marvel Comics Spider-Man takes on the identity of Ricochet during the \\"Identity Crisis\\" storyline (faced with accusations of murder and assault, Peter temporarily abandoned the Spider-Man identity and donned four new costumes to continue his heroics while trying to clear his name), to infiltrate the Rose's organization and find out more about Black Tarantula, fighting Bloodscream and Roughouse with his former enemy Delilah (although she was, in fact, Black Tarantula's ex-wife, who had fled the country with their son, disliking the changes that Carlos underwent when he took on the mantle of Black Tarantula and did not want the same fate for her son). Furthermore, Marina had a friend, who was Don Fortunato's cousin. They ask Don Fortunato for protection and Black Tarantula attacked Don Fortunato's mansion. Inside the mansion, Black Tarantula defeats Fortunato's guards including Spider-Man again, but loses his wife when she confronts him and points out that he is scaring his own son. She reminds him what a burden the title of the Black Tarantula had been on him and Carlos relented. He leaves, but tells her that he would one day come back to take his son.The Amazing Spider-Man #434-435. Marvel Comics. Black Tarantula is later seen at Ryker's Island and is taking drugs that suppress his superhuman powers. During a riot, Black Tarantula is attacked by the assassin Bullseye, who stabs him in the chest with a playing card. Black Tarantula is released early from prison due to a record of good behavior and prison overpopulation. Carlos goes to Matt Murdock for a job; Matt has him work with Dakota North, an investigator working for Nelson & Murdock. Carlos, who is dissatisfied with the job, longs for a more hands on approach to stop crime. Matt notices and takes Carlos with him to battle a Yakuza gang working in Hell's Kitchen. The leader of the Yakuza gang flees from the attack; Daredevil chases him but fails to catch him because he has the flu, which is limiting his abilities. Black Tarantula and Daredevil survey the scene and notice a large pile of money. Black Tarantula says that he would like to take the money but Daredevil stops him. Later, Black Tarantula takes on a gang whose leader was hired to kill an old woman. This leader is a vengeful former recruit of Black Tarantula who, years before, Carlos had personally invited into his gang, naming him \\"Little Loco\\".Daredevil Annual #1. Marvel Comics After Black Tarantula takes care of the gang, he kills Loco by choking him with the money he was paid for killing the woman. Daredevil shows up at the scene, asking what Black Tarantula has done; Black Tarantula then tells him that he plans on taking the rest of the money from the hideout. Daredevil attempts to stop him but is knocked out with a single punch from Black Tarantula. Black Tarantula collects the money and gets ready to leave, but before he goes he kneels in front of Daredevil and heals the flu he has been afflicted with. Black Tarantula leaves the money he took from the gang in a church, with a note saying \\"Help people with this\\".Daredevil Annual #1. Marvel Comics Carlos LaMuerto's story is focused upon again in April 2008, in a one-shot issue entitled Daredevil: Blood of the Tarantula, where he turns in desperation to Matt Murdock to help his new 'mission'. One morning Carlos was attacked in his apartment by a group of Hand assassins. His fight is observed by Lady Bullseye and he is evaluated by his performance. Some time after he defeated the assassins he was captured by Master Izo and brought to Matt Murdock's apartment.Daredevil vol. 2 #112. Marvel Comics. After some explanation the group separates and Master Izo and Black Tarantula are tracked by a Hand ninja. As they chase after him, they are led to pictures of some of the greatest martial artists including Carlos himself, Wolverine, White Tiger, and Shang-Chi.Daredevil vol. 2 #113. Marvel Comics. While out patrolling, Black Tarantula runs into White Tiger being attacked by Hand ninjas exactly like he was. After diving in to help her he is killed by White Tiger and resurrected by the Hand as an assassin.Daredevil vol. 2 #114. Marvel Comics. Carlos then leads an attack against Daredevil at his home along with White Tiger, Lady Bullseye, and Lord Hirochi. They were fought off after Daredevil was joined by Master Izo and Iron Fist. Black Tarantula defeated Iron Fist but stopped White Tiger from killing him, giving the excuse that he did not want the competition.Daredevil vol. 2 #115. Marvel Comics. Black Tarantula and White Tiger are then given the assignment to kill Foggy NelsonDaredevil (vol. 2) #119 by Lady Bullseye, who has been hired by the Owl. Black Tarantula instead saves Foggy's life and then battles White Tiger, attempting to cure her of the Hand's influence.Daredevil (vol. 2) #500 When Matt Murdock took over leadership of the Hand, Black Tarantula became Matt Murdock's lieutenant, along with White Tiger. He then currently ran the Hand in North America and oversaw the construction of \\"Shadowland\\" while Matt and White Tiger were in Japan, meeting high ranking Hand leaders from across the globe and discussing Murdock's vision of a more heroic Hand.Shadowland #3 (September 2010). Marvel Comics. While New York was in crisis, Black Tarantula is ordered by White Tiger to execute looters, but he becomes confused and sees that something is wrong with Matt Murdock's motives. However, White Tiger was still possessed by the Hand and stabbed Black Tarantula in his back with a blade, and tossed him over the edge of Shadowland to fall into a vehicle, leaving him for dead.Daredevil (vol. 2) #510 (September 2010). Marvel Comics. In the aftermath, it is revealed that Black Tarantula is still alive, having been cared for by Night Nurse following his confrontation with White Tiger.Daredevil (vol. 2) #512. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Hunted\\" storyline, Black Tarantula is among the animal-themed characters that are captured by Taskmaster and Black Ant for Kraven the Hunter's \\"Great Hunt\\" sponsored by Arcade's company Arcade Industries. He was seen watching the fight between Spider-Man and Scorpion until the Hunter-Bots created by Arcade Industries arrives.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #17. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Black Tarantula possesses superhuman strength enabling him to lift (press) up to 25 tons. He also possesses superhuman speed, reflexes and reactions, agility, and durability of an unquantified degree. He has a powerful healing factor on a par with the likes of Wolverine or Deadpool that, combined with his superhuman durability, make him extremely difficult to seriously injure. He is also able to stimulate the healing process in other people's bodies, though he rarely does this. He is able to fire laser-like beams from his eyes, but this drains his physical resources severely, so it is only used as a last resort. Spider-Man claims that it is not possible for himself to physically match Black Tarantula because the latter is not only stronger than him, but also faster and more agile. Black Tarantula is also skilled at different forms of martial arts, and has a genius level intellect. Other versions MC2 Fabian LaMuerto as the Black Tarantula in Spider-Girl #97 (April 2006). Art by Ron Frenz. In the alternate future MC2, Fabian LaMuerto, the son of the current Black Tarantula, has taken up his father's mantle. Fabian wears a variation of his father's suit, removing the sleeves and using futuristic metal gauntlets and boot-soles, and possesses the same superhuman powers as his father. He is also trained in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts. He made his first appearance in a conflict with the crime lord Canis. Many originally thought he was responsible for the death of Wilson Fisk. It was proven later to be Canis. Fabian later confronted Canis, and was about to kill him, until Spider-Girl intervened. She talked Fabian out of committing the act, after which he departed. Later, the Black Tarantula started to show an interest in May's crime fighting career and actively supported her by providing her with a strike team for backup. Spider-Girl later discovers though, that he is working with Lady Octopus to replace Canis as the Kingpin of Crime. Feeling betrayed, she accused him of using her. Fabian denied it, stating he is fascinated by her and that they are destined to be friends, if not more. Kaine and his team arrive, buying Lady Octopus time to run, while being pursued by Raptor and Spider-Girl. Black Tarantula defeats the combined forces of Kaine, Quickwire, and Big Man. He then willingly surrenders to Spider-Girl, not wanting to harm her. Fabian later escapes custody. Though a criminal, this Black Tarantula has a deep sense of honor, and he has helped support Spider-Girl's crime-fighting career. He does have a hidden agenda, however‚Äîhe hopes to win her over as \\"his mate\\". Black Tarantula and Spider- Girl face each other often, and their story is ongoing. He attempted to negotiate with the Cabal of Scriers (the former lackeys of Norman Osborn) to call off their hit on Spider-Girl, and when this failed, he challenged their leader to mortal combat for leadership of the Cabal. Victorious, he ordered the hit canceled. In Amazing Spider-Girl #3 it is revealed that after the time jump between the series, the Black Tarantula is the current Kingpin of Crime and it is implied that he is interested in the mysterious item that Mona Carlo is carrying. Mona, a known con artist, stole a disk from her boyfriend and was planning to sell it. The disk supposedly contained information about the organization of Wilson Fisk. Black Tarantula and the Hobgoblin were about to start a war to obtain it. With the help of Mad Dog, Spider-Girl obtained the disk and left Mona safely with the police. Chesbro reported to Black Tarantula about Spider-Girl's interference. Fabian decided to move on, but sent a threat to the Hobgoblin, warning him to \\"back off\\" from Spider-Girl.

Life Born 5 July 1912, Josef Fuchs was a German Jesuit priest, who taught at the Gregorian University in Rome for almost thirty years. In the 1950s, Fuchs's Natural Law and De Castitate were the standard texts for moral theology courses. While serving on the Pontifical Commission on Population, Family, and Birth from 1963 to 1966, Fuchs experienced an intellectual conversion on two levels: his understanding on the issue of artificial means of birth control within marriage and his understanding of natural law, appropriating the theological anthropology of fellow Jesuit Karl Rahner. This set the stage for Fuchs' work to achieve in moral theology what Rahner had accomplished in systematic theology. Fuchs was one of those who provided the foundations for the moral theology of the Second Vatican Council. He chaired the commission's majority report, only to have it rejected by Pope Paul VI in the encyclical Humanae vitae. Fuchs' theology focuses mostly on moral objectivity.

The population of 4,459 people as of 2012 is primarily descendants of indentured laborers who were brought from India in the mid-1830s. Crabwood Creek is located approximately two miles from the larger town of Corriverton, home to the Guyana Sugar Corporation's skeldon Estate which provides jobs to a majority of the surrounding communities. The Skeldon Estate is also in the process of building a new sugar factory. With assistance from the World Bank, this factory will be built as a co-generation plant, providing stable electricity to the residents of the surrounding communities, including Crabwood Creek. Because the sugar factory is the main source of jobs for Crabwood Creek, changes in the sugar factory have a dramatic effect on the village. Currently, a Chinese company has won the bid to build the new sugar factory. A recent influx of Chinese workers has dramatically affected the demographics of the area. There are about eight to ten sawmills in Crabwood Creek that employs more than 150 workers. Crabwood Creek is the home to one primary school while the secondary schools are in Corriverton. Children are required to attend school, although currently these regulations are enforced. Many children do attend school and have highly educated teachers who have virtually have incentive to teach. There are penalties for teachers who do not show up for work and teachers frequently don't have to wait months for their government pay checks. This is not a major problem throughout Guyana . Crabwood Creek is also home to the government sponsored Crabwood Creek Health Centre. The health centre is staffed by one medical examiner (medex) who works four days a week, two mid-wives who work two days a week, and two nursing assistants who work 3 days a week. The nurses and medex work separately with the nurses handling maternal and child health issues and the medex dealing with other health problems and emergencies. Many patients are referred to nearby Skeldon Hospital for treatment and tests. Crabwood Creek sits on the coast of the Corentyne River, the border between Guyana and Suriname. This border is the only international boundary in the world that is not the center of the river. The border between Guyana and Suriname is the high tide mark on the Guyana side of the river. Recently, oil drilling by a Canadian firm was disrupted by the Suriname Government because the area was in dispute between the two countries. The matter is currently being review by international courts.

Outside of the Saint Paul city limits, Highway 149 is known as Dodd Road. 149 is known as Smith Avenue within Saint Paul and passes over the Smith Avenue High Bridge crossing the Mississippi River. Route description Highway 149 serves as a north-south route between the communities of Eagan, Mendota Heights, West St. Paul, and the \\"West Side\\" neighborhood of Saint Paul. The northern terminus of the route is at W. 7th Street / Fort Road near downtown Saint Paul. History Highway 149 was marked in 1981. The route was originally authorized in 1920 as Trunk Highway 1. It was later part of U.S. Route 65 from 1927 to 1934. The route was paved (as 65) by 1929. In 1934, this route was renumbered State Highway 88 when U.S. 65 was rerouted on a different alignment. The route was renumbered again in 1950 as an extension of State Highway 49. By 1981, the route was renumbered 149 when a portion of State Highway 49 through downtown Saint Paul was turned back to local maintenance. The Smith Avenue High Bridge over the Mississippi River was originally a steel truss bridge built around 1895 and rebuilt as a concrete arch in 1987. On July 30, 2015, the highway was dedicated the Officer Scott Patrick Memorial Highway, named in honor of a police officer killed during a traffic stop along the highway near Bernard Street. The memorial signs were unveiled in a ceremony on the one-year anniversary of his killing. Historic Dodd Road Before it was a numbered highway in the 1920s, Dodd Road was a historic route in Minnesota. It was originally built in 1853 by Minnesota pioneer William B. Dodd and his crew. The road was built as a connection between the city of Mendota and the city of St. Peter (in south-central Minnesota) to help the development of St. Peter during its frontier days. Dodd Road was financed using private funds at a time when most roads were financed by the government to aid settlers. After years of lobbying by Lieutenant (later General) Jesse Reno a remaining portion of the funds allotted to his 1853 survey of the military road from the Missouri River to Mendota which was saved by the work on the Mendota/St. Peter section by the Dodd crew was awarded by the U.S government to the private builders. Present day Highway 149 bears little resemblance to the frontier road but follows the route in parts between Highways 3 and 55.

A Devon Family: The Story of the Aclands. London and Chichester: Phillimore, 1981, pp.1-2 Career Acland was Colonel of the 1st Devon Militia,Vivian, p.5 formed to protect Great Britain from a feared French invasion. In 1774 he was elected Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Callington in Cornwall, and forcefully expressed his Tory views in parliament by virulently opposing the movement by the American colonists to obtain independence following their complaint of \\"No taxation without representation\\". He poured scorn on those fellow MP's who sought to appease the colonists and called their proposed concessions \\"nugatory and humiliating\\" and certain to result in \\"a total convulsion of the British Empire\\". His vehemence is said to have alarmed even King George III himself, no friend of the revolutionary colonists. In his capacity as a Colonel of Militia and bypassing parliament, he presented a loyal address to the king in person promising him aid whenever and wherever called upon to put down sedition and in which he portrayed the Whig opposition as rebels to the King's interests, akin to the American colonists. This action of his gained him the enmity of the Whig party. His wife's first cousin was the prominent Whig Charles James Fox, who criticised him savagely in Parliament. Whilst still a member of Parliament he purchased a commission as an officer in the 20th Regiment of Foot. At the State opening of Parliament in October 1774, the King spoke of a \\"rebellious war\\" which had been opened by the colonists who had fired shots at Lexington and Concord, and John Acland received the privilege of moving the formal vote of thanks to the King's Speech in the House of Commons. This he did in \\"fulsome and adulatory\\" terms, which were ill-received by the Whig opposition.Acland, 1981, pp.30-1 On 8 April 1776 and accompanied by his wife and his pet dog \\"Jack Ketch\\", he set sail in the Kent from Cork in Ireland for Canada as a major of Grenadiers in the 20th Foot, serving under his friend General John Burgoyne at the head of an army to reinforce the British troops.Acland, 1981, p.p.31-2 He was present with Burgoyne during his invasion of northern New York in 1777. Prisoner of war On 7 October 1777 at the Battle of Bemis Heights, near Stillwater, New York he was shot through the legs by the Americans and was taken prisoner. His wife, Lady Harriet, was allowed to enter the American camp to nurse her husband and was well-treated by the American soldiers. Acland was grateful for the treatment received when recuperating as a prisoner of war, so much so that following his return to England he challenged a certain Lieutenant Lloyd to a duel when the latter spoke poorly of Americans at a dinner party. Although he survived the duel, he caught a cold during it from which he died at Pixton Park in 1778.

Harriet was a first cousin of the leading Whig statesman Charles James Fox, a political opponent of her husband. She accompanied her husband on his military service in Canada, and displayed exceptionally courageous behaviour, for which she later became celebrated. Not only did she insist on following her husband as the campaigning progressed, but insisted on crossing over the Hudson River into enemy territory in order to nurse her prisoner-of-war husband for nine weeks.

Research suggested that Bellamann was working off resentment of his upbringing in Fulton, Missouri, where he had been ostracised for his German extraction and rumoured illegitimacy. The 1942 film version gave Ronald Reagan a star role, regarded as his most memorable performance. Bellamann was also a poet and a music professor at Vassar College.  Early life and education  Bellamann was born in Fulton, Missouri, to parents George Henrik and Caroline (Krahenbuhl) Bellamann. After graduation from Fulton High School in 1899, he attended Westminster College in Fulton for a year before moving to Colorado in 1901 to study piano at the University of Denver.Dictionary of Missouri Biography by Lawrence O. Christensen, University of Missouri Press, 1999 Following graduation in 1904, Bellamann began teaching music at a variety of girls' schools in the American South. Bellamann met his future wife, Katherine McKee Jones, while both were teaching at a girls' academy in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The couple married on September 3, 1907. For several years between 1908 and 1913 while on school summer breaks, the Bellamanns traveled to Europe so Henry could study organ and piano with Charles-Marie Widor and Isidor Philipp. From 1907 to 1932, when he began to pursue writing full-time, Bellamann held administrative and teaching positions at several educational institutions, including acting director of the Juilliard Musical Foundation, dean of the Curtis Institute of Music, and professor of music at Vassar College. Writing career With the encouragement of his wife, Bellamann increasingly turned his attention to a writing career. His first of three books of poetry, A Music Teacher's Notebook, was published in 1920. It was followed by Cups of Illusion in 1923 and The Upward Pass in 1928. Although his poetry is today little- known, Bellamann was recognized by David Perkins in his 1976 History of Modern Poetry, in which he ranks Bellamann with the serious minor poets who \\"adopted the mode\\" of the Imagists.A History of Modern Poetry, David Perkins, Belknap Press, 1976 (p. 347) In addition to his books, Bellamann served as editor for the music magazine Overtones and write a weekly literary column, in which he highlighted the works of DuBose Heyward and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Julia Peterkin Henry Bellamann's first novel, Petenera's Daughter, was published in 1926, followed by Crescendo in 1928, The Richest Woman in Town in 1932, and The Gray Man Walks in 1938. His most famous work was yet to come ‚Äì and not without some controversy that remains to this day. Kings Row (1940) The story of Drake McHugh and his best friend Parris Mitchell coming of age in a sleepy midwest American town of the 1890s was by far Henry Bellamann's most recognized work. Exposing hypocrisy and small-town secrets, the novel deals with themes of mental illness, incest, homosexuality, suicide, gender equality in relationships, and sadistic vengeance. Such themes were still somewhat taboo in early 20th-century American literature, but not unheard of. In one location, however, the novel and its subsequent movie adaptation proved to be most controversial: Bellamann's hometown of Fulton, Missouri. It was not long before the citizenry of Fulton began to look around and realize Bellamann's fictional town was in fact a reinterpretation of their small city. \\"Aberdeen College\\" is seen as a stand-in for Bellamann's real-life time spent at Westminster College, while the best-seller's asylum coincides with Fulton State Hospital. Such prominent citizens as the real-life town doctor are portrayed in Kings Row in a less-than-flattering manner. As one local newspaper editor wrote, Bellamann \\"clearly intended to besmirch Fulton\\". The ill feelings toward the book lingered for many years in Fulton, to the point where librarians removed Kings Row from the town library shelves. This controversy seems to have been borne out by Bellamann himself. While researching the introduction for a re-issue of Kings Row in 1981, Jay Miles Karr, a Westminster College English professor, found in Bellamann's private papers notes for what was referred to as \\"the Fulton novel.\\" According to Karr, living in Fulton had inflicted a \\"psychic wound\\" on the young Bellamann, one he exorcised decades later with his pen. He was often made to feel alienated there because of his German heritage. Furthermore, the family reputation was assaulted by town gossip that George Bellamann might not have been Henry's true biological father. Interviews with his few childhood friends confirmed that Bellamann was regarded as a social outcast in the town. Having made the best-seller list, Kings Row soon had a movie version in the works. Released in 1942, with some of the more controversial portions of the novel toned down to satisfy the Hays Code, the film starred Ann Sheridan, Robert Cummings, and Ronald Reagan as Drake McHugh. Movie critics consider Reagan's performance in the film to be one of his best, and it was one of his favorite roles. In fact, he titled his 1965 autobiography Where's the Rest of Me? after one of his key lines in the movie, where McHugh comments on his amputated legs. Later work and death After the huge success of Kings Row, Bellamann published two more novels, Floods of Spring in 1942 and Victoria Grandolet in 1943. He began a sequel to Kings Row but died of a heart attack in their New York City home in June 1945 before its completion. His wife Katherine, a novelist and poet in her own right, finished the work, Parris Mitchell of Kings Row, publishing it in 1948. Katherine Bellamann survived her husband by eleven years, dying in 1956. The Bellamanns had no children.

In the mid 1970's Hiseman played with Dave Greenslade when he toured the album 'Cactus Choir'. Hiseman subsequently played in jazz groups, notably with his wife, saxophonist Barbara Thompson, with whom he recorded and produced more than 15 albums. Andrew Lloyd Webber, searching for a \\"sound\\" for an album to feature his brother Julian on cello, stumbled upon Colosseum II by accident and imported the whole band into his \\"Variations\\" project. This was the start of a ten-year relationship with Hiseman, whose drumming features on recordings, TV specials and musicals. In 1982 Hiseman built what was at the time a state-of- the-art recording studio next to his home, and together with the compositional skills of Barbara Thompson produced many recordings for film and television soundtracks. Hiseman was a founding member of the United Jazz and Rock Ensemble, a German-based \\"Band of Band Leaders\\", along with Barbara Thompson. Colosseum reunited in June 1994 with the same line-up of musicians as when they broke up 23 years earlier. They played the Freiburg Zelt Musik Festival and followed it up with a German TV Special (WDR Cologne) in October, which was recorded and released as a CD and a VHS video; a DVD version followed in 2003. Several new studio releases also followed, as well as [4] expanded editions of Valentyne Suite and Colosseum Live, plus several compilation boxed sets. Barbara Thompson joined the band on various occasions before the death of Dick Heckstall-Smith in 2004 and since then was a permanent member of the band. Colosseum played its farewell concert on 28 February 2015. In October 2010, a biography of Hiseman, entitled Playing the Band, was published. It was written by Martyn Hanson and edited by original Colosseum manager, Colin Richardson. In 2017, Hiseman formed a new trio band called JCM. The band recorded an album Heroes late in 2017 and it was released in April 2018. JCM began touring on 7 April 2018. Other members are guitarist/vocalist Clem Clempson and bass player/vocalist Mark Clarke. Death In May 2018, Hiseman's family reported that he was struggling with a brain tumour. He died at the age of 73 on 12 June 2018 in Sutton, England. He was nine days short of his 74th birthday. Selected discography * A Night in the Sun (1982) * About Time Too!

The Liverpool College for Girls, Huyton, as it was originally known, was started in 1894 and intended to be parallel to the Liverpool College Boys' Upper School. It catered for girls between the ages of 4 and 18. In its early days, and towards the end of its time based at Huyton Hall before the merger, it also took day boys up to the age of seven. The school is mentioned in the book The Wildcats of St Trinian's by Frank Launder.Launder, F (1980) The Wildcats of St Trinian's (London, Armada)  Motto  Fideliter fortiter feliciter (Faithful, happy, brave)  School buildings and grounds  The main school administration was based in Huyton Hall with some classrooms in the adjoining building, which was called Fernwood.http://www.suttonkersh.co.uk/templates/en/new_developments_files/old_swan_theOrchard.pdf Huyton Hall and Fernwood had previously owned by a member of the Beecham family. Within the grounds there were extensive gardens, playing fields set up as lacrosse pitches, a large sports hall, tennis and netball courts, a swimming pool, extensive laboratories, an art room with kiln, an extensive music suite with practice rooms, a domestic science kitchen, needlework room, secretarial training suite, school bookshop and a large sanatorium. There was also a large school hall with stage, professional lighting and a Bechstein grand piano, a fiction library and a large panelled reference library where older girls would study during free periods. The Orchard was the main access road through the grounds, which was a public right of way and which effectively divided the school site into two. The headmistress lived on site in Greenhill,http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-215308-greenhill- huyton-with-roby a house originally inhabited by Lord and Lady Cozens- Hardy,http://www.dmm.org.uk/company/s1023.htm and some other members of staff lived on site from time to time. The main school buildings were predominantly mid-Victorian converted domestic homes (with original bell pulls, claw foot baths and servants' staircases still in place in a lot of cases). Large building programmes had taken place in the 1930s, 1960s and 1980s to extend the school. The school buildings and grounds have now been redeveloped into private residential housing.Rees, E. M. (1985) A History of Huyton College (Liverpool, Huyton College) The four main boarding houses are now residential homes for the elderly.  Boarding  At the time of its closure, the main boarding house names were St Hilda's (named after Hilda of Whitby), St Mary's (named after the mother of Christ), St Margaret's (named after the devout Scottish queen), and St Clare's (named after the founder of the religious order of the Poor Clares). Previously there had also been other boarding houses, including St. Joan's, St Bride's and the houses for prep school pupils, St Anne's (boarding) and St Catherine's (main preparatory school teaching building). During the mid-20th century there was a further boarding house outside the school compound, at the bottom of the hill, called St Helena's, where, whenever possible, children whose parents lived abroad were housed, so that they felt they were 'going home' at the end of the school day. Sixth formers were housed at The Grange. In the last 20 years or so of the school's presence in Huyton, day girls had access to the boarding houses and their common rooms during their lunch hours, so they could feel fully part of the extended school community. Boarding houses were staffed by a housemistress and a relief housemistress who would provide cover during the main housemistress's 24-hour period off each week. By the late 1970s, approximately 25 boarders belonged to each boarding house, although they did their homework (known as prep) in the main school building and took their meals in the main school dining room in Huyton Hall/Fernwood.Rees, E.M (1985) A History of Huyton College (Liverpool, Huyton College)  Uniform  In the early days of the school, girls wore long dark skirts and white blouses.http://history.knowsley.gov.uk/show_photo.msql?reference=HU93/189&search;=72 By the 1960s, the school uniform was divided into two seasons, winter and summer. It was available from George Henry Lee, a branch of John Lewis based in Liverpool. The winter attire was a blue Harris tweed coat, and skirt specially woven for the school in Scotland, and nylon, later cotton, sky blue blouse, a navy tie and a Navy blue wool sweater. A felt 'pudding bowl' hat was also worn in the winter. A black full length wool cloak with a cowl hood lined in felt with individual house colours was also part of the uniform (red for St Hilda's, yellow for St Margaret's, green for St. Mary's and blue for St. Clare's), worn by both boarders and day girls to keep them warm whilst running back and forth from houses. The summer uniform was a black wool blazer, cotton Calpreta print dress (again in house colours) and a straw boater with blue trim.  School chapel and choir  The centre of spiritual life in the school was the chapel, with its Royal School of Church Music registered choir. Canon Donald Gray was the School Chaplain in the 1970s and early 1980s; he became the Rector of Liverpool and then Chaplain of the House of Commons, Rector of St Margaret's, Westminster and Chaplain to the Queen, and was well known in the Church of England for leading the 1980s rewrite of the Order of Communion service, amongst others. The school chapel was used on a daily basis for both morning prayer and until the late 1970s, evensong (for the boarders), as well as Sunday services, baptisms and confirmations, and choral concerts. The chapel choir recorded albums in the late 1970s and late 1980s, and appeared on television during the semi-finals of the National School Choir Competition in 1983.Rees, E.M (1985) A History of Huyton College (Liverpool, Huyton College)Johnson, R (1927) The Story of our Chapel (Liverpool, Huyton College)  World War II evacuation  During the Second World War, the girls were relocated to Blackwell House in the Lake District.Rees, E.M (1985) A History of Huyton College (Liverpool, Huyton College)http://www.blackwell.org.uk/recent-history- restorationhttp://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/index/learning/archaeology/archaeologyteachers/archaeologyeducationww2/archaeologyww2evacuation.htm  Notable alumni  *Mary Arden DBE (b. 1947), Judge *Andrea Boardman (b. 1968), TV presenter *Barbara Pym (1913‚Äì1980), Novelist * Deryn Rees-Jones (b. 1968) Poet Profile * Mary Hope Metszies (nee Hattersley) musician  References  Category:Defunct schools in Liverpool Category:Educational institutions established in 1894 Category:1894 establishments in England Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1993 Category:1993 disestablishments in England ","title":"Huyton College"},{"id":"4480075","text":"Philip Henry Taylor (18 September 1917 ‚Äì 1 December 2012) was an English footballer who played for and managed Liverpool. Player Taylor played for his hometown club Bristol Rovers as an apprentice (in 21 league matches, scoring twice) before he was signed by Liverpool manager George Patterson for ¬£5000 plus Ted Hartill in March 1936, he made his debut on the 28th of the same month in a league game at the Baseball Ground, Liverpool shared the points with Derby County in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Taylor scoring a late equaliser, his first goal for the club. Taylor joined Liverpool as a young inside-forward with a lot of potential, but was reverted by George Kay to wing-half in which position he developed into a stylish, composed defender. Taylor was a member of Liverpool's 1946‚Äì47 Championship-winning team, making 35 league appearances, scoring once. He represented England three times, making his debut on 18 October 1947 in a British Home Championship match at Ninian Park, Cardiff. England legends Tom Finney, Stan Mortensen and Tommy Lawton made it a memorable day for Taylor, scoring the goals in a 3‚Äì0 win. Taylor was handed the captaincy during the 1949/50 season and led the side to the FA Cup final on 29 April 1950; he appeared seven times in the club's Cup run. Arsenal spoilt the day for the Reds by beating them 2‚Äì0. Overall Taylor played 345 games for Liverpool, scoring 34 goals (which included 312 league appearances and 32 league goals). Taylor was also a first-class cricketer, and played a single game for the Gloucestershire first team in 1938, as well as three games for their second eleven. Manager Upon his retirement in 1954 he joined the backroom staff as a coach. He became manager of Liverpool in 1956 when former manager Don Welsh was sacked after failing to gain promotion back to the 1st Division. Taylor took over the reins with a determination to put Liverpool back where they belonged, immediately signing Alan A'Court, Tommy Younger, and club legend Ronnie Moran who ended up spending five decades at Anfield. Taylor, however, failed to achieve what he set out to do, and after an unsteady start to the 1959/60 campaign he resigned, stating \\"The strain of trying to win promotion has proved too much.\\" A very sad Taylor spoke to the Liverpool Echo newspaper about the difficult decision to resign as Liverpool manager, saying: \\"No matter how great has been the disappointment of the Directors at our failure to win our way back to the First Division, it has not been greater than mine. I made it my goal. I set my heart on it and strove for it with all the energy I could muster. Such striving has not been enough and now the time has come to hand over to someone else to see if they can do better.\\" He was succeeded by Bill Shankly. Taylor's legacy to Liverpool was the back room team he assembled of Reuben Bennett, Joe Fagan and Bob Paisley. All three were retained by Shankly, who together with them built a hugely successful club. Promotion was achieved in 1962, and by the time Shankly retired in 1974, Liverpool had won three league titles, two FA Cups and one UEFA Cup. Even more success, including six league titles and three European Cup triumphs, followed during Paisley's nine years as manager, while Fagan won three major trophies during the first of his two seasons as manager. Of the players who were signed or given debuts by Taylor, several went on to play a part in Liverpool's success under Shankly. They included striker Roger Hunt, given his debut by Taylor in 1958, who spent 11 years at Anfield and scored 286 goals, and was also a member of England's World Cup-winning side in 1966. Retirement and death Taylor lived to the age of 95, and was believed to be the oldest living England international footballer at the time of his death, one of the last surviving players to have played before the Second World War. He died on 1 December 2012.

Matt Brewing Company is a family-owned brewery in Utica, New York. It is the fourth oldest family-owned brewery in the United States, having brewed beer since 1888. Its most popular product is the Saranac line of beers; soft drinks such as root beer and ginger beer are also sold.  History  After working at the Duke of Baden Brewery of the Black Forest region in Baden, Germany, Francis Xavier Matt I immigrated to the United States in 1880. Matt worked at the Charles Bierbauer Brewery as lead salesman and brewmaster in Utica for a few years before reorganizing it into The West End Brewing Company in 1888. During Prohibition, the company stayed afloat by producing soft drinks under the label Utica Club, and also made Ginger Ale and non-alcoholic malt tonics. After the end of Prohibition, Utica Club became the name of the brewery's flagship beer, promoted during the 1950s and 1960s by two beer steins, Schultz and Dooley, voiced by Jonathan Winters. Schultz & Dooley were first introduced to television audiences in 1959 and rapidly became the West End Brewing Company's favorite \\"spokes mugs\\". The company was also the first in the United States to obtain a license to sell beer after the end of the prohibition.https://www.uticaod.com/article/20080708/News/307089884 Another very important factor for marketing was the \\"Utica Club Natural Carbonation Band Beer Drinking Song\\". On March 21, 1968 members of Utica Club sales previewed a new campaign called \\"swings\\". Created by Wells, Rich, Greene, Inc. \\"The campaign started with introductory television spots featuring a mythical nightclub, the Utica Club, which embodied the most desirable features of the best nightclubs in the world.\\" The campaign introduced \\"Utica Club Natural Carbonation Band Beer Drinking Song\\". The selection was created for the Matt Brewing Company by one of commercial music's best-credentialed composers, the great Sasha Burland\\" (Forgotten Buffalo 2014). This song aimed to persuade the customers that Utica Club was a hip night club, and people would drink Utica Club beer while listening to this song. The brewery, later renamed Matt Brewing Company, became popular throughout the Northeast based on Utica Club and its current flagship beer, Saranac. The company is in its fourth generation of family ownership and is led by Nick Matt (chairman and CEO) and Fred Matt (president). The brewery is served by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (NYS&W;) from their line next to the brewery which runs down the middle of Schuyler Street. On May 29, 2008, a fire broke out in the packaging section of the F.X. Matt Brewery.F.X. Matt Brewery - Utica, NY 13501 - The Observer-Dispatch The fire was caused by a spark from the welding going on inside the building. The fire destroyed the second and third floor of the packing building. During the fire, Utica city Public Safety Commissioner Daniel Labella warned reporters about two blocks from the scene: \\"Don't breathe the fire!\\" presumably meaning \\"smoke\\". The fire caused over $10 million in damage. Brewing and kegging of Utica Club resumed the following week. Canning operations temporarily moved to the High Falls Brewing Company (makers of Genesee beer) in Rochester, NY, until the damaged equipment could be replaced. After the fire, brewery officials focused on procuring state grants to mount a rebuilding effort that restored their brewing operations. Brewery chairman Nick Matt told the Utica Observer Dispatch in May 2009: > We have had an opportunity to upgrade equipment. We are going to end up with > a canning facility that is more flexible, faster and more efficient. It will > be a facility that is better than before. We lost of warehousing space, and > now we are building of warehousing space. And as a result of changing and > moving operations, we are going to be able to streamline some of our > operations.At brewery, devastation spurs creation . Bottling returned to the F.X. Matt brewery after one month.  Family leadership  Floor of the Saranac Brewery Francis Xavier Matt acquired his brewing expertise as a student of the Duke of Baden, and was considered a proficient brewer upon his arrival in the city of Utica in 1880. His grandson, F.X. Matt II, remarked that, under the duke's tutelage, F.X. Matt I gained brewing experience \\"as an art, not a science; as a way of life, not a way of making a living.\\" Combining his talents with Charles Bierbauer, who was additionally skillful in old world brewing techniques, Matt nurtured a reputation in Utica's westside that resulted in his role as brewmaster, superintendent, and treasurer of a newly organized West End Brewing Company in 1888.\\"Story of Brewing in Utica,\\" from The Upstate, Lucy Clark, ed, Dec./Jan. 1942‚Äì43, pp. 12‚Äì13, 20‚Äì21. F.X. Matt led the brewery until 1951. Though F.X. Matt I stayed on to serve as brewery chairman until his death in 1958, his son Walter Matt began his tenure as president of the West End Brewery in 1951, serving in that role until 1980. Walter Matt modernized brewing operations. He also assisted in efforts to attract new businesses to the Utica area as the region entered its post-industrial period. F.X. Matt II, upon becoming president of the family business in 1980, soon thereafter renamed the brewery the F.X. Matt Brewing Co. in recognition of his grandfather. Under his leadership, the brewery kept up with national trends, including the introduction of the Saranac brand in 1985. Upon the unveiling of Matt's Premium Light Beer in 1982, F.X. Matt II brought a poetic flair to the brewery's marketing: > Look out Bud! Look out Miller! > New Matt's Light is a giant killer > With taste that's great and body surprising > Look out you guys‚Äîa new sun is arising. > > We're not very big compared to you > But we love our beer and know how to brew‚Äî > A great light beer‚Äîwith malt and hops > Shove over guys‚Äîyour monopoly stops Competition with larger brewers, within the context of staying afloat in a Rust Belt city such as Utica, was a continual theme for the Matt Brewery throughout the 1980s. For example, in 1985, F.X. Matt II sponsored an open letter to then Utica Mayor Louis LaPolla which criticized the mayor for not featuring Matt products at a fundraiser hosted by LaPolla. Matt II admitted that not seeing local beverage products at the event \\"was a real blow to our pride\\", arguing that such oversights eliminated \\"the thought that it's in the community's self interest to be a booster of those products which it makes itself.\\" Matt II had identified that the Matt Brewing Company was \\"in a war for [its] very survival\\", given that so many smaller breweries during that era were annexed or consolidated by larger brewing interests.Utica Observer- Dispatch, 1985-07-17, p. 3 (advertisement). LaPolla and Matt II moved on to build a more positive relationship,Utica Observer-Dispatch, 2001-01-16, p. 6a. and Matt Brewing Company continued to be a business anchor in the city, spurred particularly by the popularity of its Saranac line of beers among the growing market of microbrew or craft beer enthusiasts. In order to maintain its market presence amidst the larger ongoing beer pricing war, F.X. Matt II developed a two-pronged strategy. First, Matt II initiated the new Saranac line of beers with the advice of notable brewmaster Joseph Owades (originator of the Light Beer formula). Second, teaming with families members, including his brother Nick, Matt II purchased the brewery from a family trust, subsequently reconfiguring the breweries corporate strategy with the ultimate goal of augmenting the Saranac brand. The Saranac brand eventually gained the brewery new esteem in the microbrew category of brewers, and a company that had seen sales of its beers plummet during the 1980s witnessed a doubling of sales during the early to mid-1990s. F.X. Matt II served as brewery chairman until his death in 2001. Currently, the brewery is overseen by Nick Matt, chairman and CEO, with his nephew Fred Matt serving as president. The brewery continues to host, as it has for the past eleven years, Saranac Thursday Night, a weekly social event during the summer featuring beer, food, and live music, drawing thousands of people to Utica's Varick Street. As a result, the surrounding confines of the brewery has been marketed as the city's \\"Brewery District\\", which has witnessed a renaissance of local night spots and the addition of restaurants and live music venues. The brewery also offers paid tours year round. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from the gift shop. A tour lasts for about one hour and ends in the tasting room. Winter it's recommended to call ahead.  Award winning beers  The Matt Brewery has produced thirty different beers in its Saranac line over the past two decades, which include Adirondack Lager (German amber lager), Black & Tan (stout/amber lager blend), Pale Ale (English pale ale), Black Forest (Bavarian Schwarzbier), India Pale Ale, Lager (traditional American lager), and a seasonal Belgian White (white beer). In addition to this the brewery has produced hundreds of test beers, earning the nickname \\"Beer of the Week\\". The Saranac line of beers have been awarded several honors since its inception. In addition to beers sold in traditional packaging, Saranac sells assorted beers in twelve packs as its Adirondack Trail Mix and seasonally as the Twelve Beers of Winter (called the Twelve Beers of Christmas until the 2006-2007 season). A number of family brands such as Kaltenberg, Black Cola, Two Dogs, and X.O. Premium Blend are all recognized products of the brewery. In the late 1970s, Matt Brewery was one of the four breweries that produced Billy Beer. At the dawn of the craft- brewing movement in the mid-1980s, Matt began contract-brewing many of the East Coast's most successful brands: New Amsterdam Amber Beer, Pete's Wicked, Brooklyn Lager, Newman's Albany Amber, Dock Street Amber, Blue Moon, and Olde Heurich. Matt Brewery brews beer for other brands on contract. While Matt's connection with Brooklyn Brewery and Pete's Brewing Company are well known, the company will not disclose any of its clients or how much beer it brews for competitors. In addition to beer, Matt Brewery also distributes popular soft drinks, notably the Saranac 1888 Root Beer. Other drinks include diet Root Beer, Shirley Temple, Orange Cream, Ginger Beer, black cherry, and Sparkling Lemonade. Saranac Pale Ale During the spring of 2007, the Washington Post provided a unique perspective on both the Saranac Pale Ale and on the Matt Brewery itself. Saranac Pale Ale was named a finalist in the newspaper's \\"Beer Madness\\" tasting, a competition that playfully mimics the NCAA Men's College Basketball Tournament. Though Saranac Pale Ale lost in the final round to Brooklyn Lager, Matt's Brewery inevitably walked away a victor, given that the brewery is a contract brewer for the Brooklyn Beer Company. Subsequently, authorities such as the Washington Post have dubbed the Pale Ale (first introduced in 1994) as the brewery's \\"flagship brand\\". Utica Club thumb Utica Club is a 5.0% abv pale lager and has ; introduced in 1933 at the West End Brewing Company (today the Matt Brewing Company). It was the first beer officially sold after Prohibition. It is a minor brand in comparison to the brewery's primary line of Saranac beers. Some affectionately refer to Utica Club as \\"Uncle Charlie\\", and to Utica Club Light as \\"Uncle Charlie Lewis\\". \\"Schultz and Dooley\\" Utica Club's most famous campaign icons were a pair of talking beer steins, \\"Schultz and Dooley\\", who appeared in several popular television commercials that ran from 1959 to 1964. DDB (Doyle Dane Bernbach) copywriter David Reider created the characters and comedian Jonathan Winters supplied the voices of Schultz, Dooley, and the other beer steins that appeared in the commercials. The original Schultz and Dooley steins in the commercials were actually made of wood by famous puppeteer Bil Baird. Many Utica Club commercials depicted two characters ending an argument abruptly on ordering a Utica Club beer, leading to the jingle \\"It's tough to argue over an Utica Club, 'cause they put too much love into it!\\" The original character steins were Shultz, a German with a mustache and a bright chrome pickelhaube, and Dooley, an Irishman, with red hair and a shamrock. The original steins have special markings below the handles and on the bottom to identify them from others. These original steins can go for as much as $1200.00 in today's market. The F.X. Matt Brewery released over fifty different characters since the 1990s to 2012. Now they make different characters for a different range of people to enjoy. Utica Club sales have seen a 9% sales increase from 2004 to 2005. USA Today reported in 2005 that sales increases of beers such as Utica Club and Pabst Blue Ribbon are part of a retro beer trend among younger drinkers. Subsidiaries In 2010, Matt Brewing Company purchased Flying Bison Brewing Company of Buffalo, New York, rescuing the brewery from financial hardship.

In the early 1970s, WGSU was one of the most progressive radio stations in the country. The radio format, brilliantly developed and executed by John Davlin, was known as a \\"continuum.\\" Alumni of this era went on to be music and program directors of commercial stations, a TV news anchorman, and a manager of a college radio station. After Davlin's departure in 1976, WGSU continued to operate with a dedicated staff of student managers and programmers, providing the western New York region with an eclectic mix of rock, jazz, blues, World music (referred to at the time as \\"ethnic\\") and a smattering of classical music. A typical program during that period could include such diverse artists as Pat Metheny, Bruce Cockburn, Karla Bonoff, Clifton Chenier, Thelonious Monk, Gentle Giant, Patti Smith. and Captain Beefheart. WGSU rode the first rumblings of the new wave in the mid 1970s, featuring musicians like Talking Heads, Elvis Costello. and Devo before they gained nationwide attention.

The novel depicts the Second Coming of Christ in a future United States ruled by the religious right. Tony Hendra has recorded several \\"Godcasts\\" recapping the events that have transpired between now and the second coming. Plot summary In the near future, Christianity has dominated everything, including politics, television, the Internet, and film. The leaders of the semi-theocracy include Reverend Jimmy, a televangelist who is the spiritual advisor to the President, and Pastor Bob, a laid-back reverend who is obsessed with golf and competes with Jimmy for spiritual dominance. Ironically, though Jimmy says he has spoken to God about almost everything, their teachings are the opposite of Jesus Christ's ideas of peace, love, and forgiveness towards everyone. Jimmy even claims on his program that bombing Europe will bring the Second Coming. However, a jaded ex-reporter, Johnny Greco, bitter towards Jimmy, has already found it, in an Irish-Hispanic Catholic named Jay, who performs incredible miracles of healing sick people, preaches against what Christianity has become, and values peace, tolerance, and love for all humans. Dismissive at first, he soon begins to believe in what Jay is saying, and begins to think that Jay truly is \\"the real deal\\". Unfortunately for Jay, things happen as they previously did and Jay, some of his closest apostles and Reverend Jim (who Jay converts) are killed. However, Jay's apostles continue to spread the word of his actions and teachings and form a new religion. The book ends: :THE END :AND THE BEGINNING Major themes The novel generally questions whether Christianity has truly followed Jesus' teachings of compassion and humanity. Hendra notes that many Christians preach of killing others \\"in the name of the lord\\" or justifying homophobia or racism using Jesus' teachings. These ideals are in complete contrast to Jesus' ideals that you must sympathize with the outcasts and unpopular rather than persecuting them, and that you must treat your brother as you yourself would like to be treated. The Reverend Jimmy is something of a parody of televangelists and spiritual leaders such as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, who have sometimes gone against Jesus' ideals (such as Robertson suggesting the United States assassinate Hugo Ch√°vez).

History The school was founded in 1930 by Elisabeth Morrow, daughter of Elizabeth Cutter Morrow, and Constance Chilton, with an initial enrollment of forty students. Since the mid-1950s the school had expanded, enlarging its campus on the grounds of the Morrow Family estate to serve students from nursery through eighth grade. In 2004-05, a new middle school was added, so that students can now complete their education through Grade Eight. Today, the three-year-old classes through kindergarten class sizes range from 16 to 18 with two full-time teachers, plus specialists in music, art, science, physical education, computer and foreign language. First through eighth grade classes range from 14 to 18 with one teacher and increased instruction by the above specialists. Campus The school's campus encompasses three classroom buildings, two gymnasiums/performing arts center, three playgrounds, playing field and running brook. Facilities include three state-of-the-art science labs, technology labs, three libraries, two music, and two art studios as well as a middle school social space and ceramics studio. Morrow House, the former Georgian home of the Morrow family, is now home to fifth through eighth graders. The Little School, built in 1939, is home to first through fourth graders, while nursery and kindergarteners learn and play in Chilton House, designed in 1970 especially with the needs of early childhood in mind. Fourth Grade was not connected to the Little School until 2005, when the admission rooms were moved. There is currently no cafeteria, although lunch services are provided. Admission Admission to the Elisabeth Morrow School is highly competitive. Students are drawn to the school from 50 nearby towns and represent a wide variety of national, religious, and racial backgrounds. The school welcomes families who consider education a priority, and students who have a high level of enthusiasm for learning and a concern for one another. The school accepts applications for three-year-olds through seventh grade throughout the year, however, the admissions process must be complete by winter of the year prior to enrollment (see The Independent School Admissions Association of Greater New York for the notification dates). A completed file will include the application, a parent questionnaire, teacher recommendation and school transcript as well as a parent interview and student class visit. All candidates for PK through grade 4 need to take the Early Childhood Admissions Assessment through Educational Records Bureau. Grades 5 though 7 need to take the Independent School Entrance Examination (ISEE). The school encourages families with limited financial resources to apply for financial assistance.

It was first published in 1997 in Germany by Doris & Frank under the name Ursuppe and this original version won 2nd prize in the 1998 Deutscher Spiele Preis. Theme Each player guides a species of primitive amoeba drifting through the primordial soup. The player controls whether and how their amoebas move, eat and procreate using the 10 biological points which s/he receives each turn. A player may evolve their species by buying gene cards, which give the amoebas abilities such as faster movement. The abilities are pictured on the gene cards, showing amoebas growing fins, tentacles, spines, etc. A key feature of the game is its self-balancing ecosystem. The food required by each amoeba is a mixture of the excrement of the other players' species. Food may become scarce and cause amoebas to starve, die and decompose into food. If one species becomes scarce, this will then cause problems for the other players, since their amoebas depend on all the other species to supply their food. Genes may mitigate this, for example by turning a species into a predator. However, this still requires some healthy prey to be available. Furthermore, the other players may react by turning their amoebas into predators themselves, growing spines for defense, or simply increase their procreation rate to offset the losses. The success of each strategy highly depends on the other players' actions as each species evolves to fill ecological niches. Objective Primordial Soup Each turn each species scores points based upon its population and genes. The game ends when a player reaches 42 points or when the last environment card is drawn. This usually happens after 5-10 rounds so the game lasts 1‚Äì2 hours. Equipment * A game board with spaces representing the primordial soup, a scoring track, and a compass diagram. * Two dice. * 28 pegged discs representing amoebas, in four sets of different colors and shapes. * 37 biological point tokens. * 25 beads for marking damage. * 55 foodstuff cubes in each color. * 4 score markers. * 33 gene cards. * 11 environment cards which indicate the direction of drift and the thickness of the ozone layer. * Game rules and reference sheets.

He was known as \\"Felix the Cat\\" after the cartoon character. History Mitchell was born in Oakland and lived in the 69th Avenue San Antonio Village housing projects. After dropping out of high school, Mitchell created a criminal organization called \\"My Other Brother, or 6-9 Mob\\" a.k.a. \\"MOB\\". Connected with L.A. kingpin Tootie Reese, he made business contacts in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Detroit. For more than a decade, Mitchell battled competition from Mickey Moore‚Äôs crime family and the Funktown USA gang to gain total control of the heroin market. Before 1984‚Äì1985 and the widespread practice of free-basing cocaine, heroin use was more common. It is estimated that Mitchell brought in as much as $5 million annually. Mitchell was targeted by local and federal law enforcement. He was convicted in 1985 and sentenced to life in prison at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary where he was fatally stabbed on August 21, 1986, two days before his 32nd birthday, a little more than a year later.\\"Drug Boss Stabbed to Death in Prison\\" Funeral and notoriety Mitchell's funeral gained national attention as an example of the impact drugs and drug-culture was having on the country's youth. Thousands of people lined the streets to pay their respects as the funeral procession went through Mitchell‚Äôs old Oakland neighborhood. His body was carried through crowded streets by a horse- drawn carriage trailed by 14 Rolls Royce limousines and was attended by Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P. Newton.America's Crusade, Time Magazine September 15, 1986 According to an interview with Bay Area radio personality Jimmy Guy: \\"I remember his funeral, it was like Martin Luther King had died and that coverage went out all over the country. I didn't want my city to just be known for honoring a drug lord.\\" The service received news coverage internationally. Onlookers lined the streets to watch the procession. The procession began at Mitchell's former residence, the San Antonio Villas and ended at the Star Bethel Baptist Church at San Pablo and Stanford Avenues in Oakland. Many civic leaders and citizens were appalled that the services were allowed to take place at all. Proper permits for the event had been filed. Mitchell's criminal convictions were overturned by a federal judge on technicalities, a few years after his death. Criminologists named an effect after him known as the \\"Felix Mitchell Paradox\\" ‚Äîwhereby after a major successful police operation (like the arrest of Mitchell) crime and violence both went up instead of down as one might expect. It is thought that Felix had such monopoly power in parts of Oakland that he controlled pricing and policed the violence of smaller gangs. When he was arrested it left a power vacuum and the smaller gangs started both price wars and shooting wars to fill the void.

Social shopping attempts to use technology to mimic the social interactions found in physical malls and stores. With the rise of mobile devices, social shopping is now extending beyond the online world and into the offline world of shopping. Five categories Social shopping spans a wide range of definitions but can largely be divided into five categories: Group shopping sites, Shopping communities, Recommendation engines, Shopping Marketplaces, and Shared Shopping. # Group shopping sites include companies like Groupon and LivingSocial. These sites encourage groups of people to buy together at wholesale prices, essentially a Costco-like model for the online world. # Shopping communities bring like- minded people together to discuss, share, and shop. Using the wisdom of crowds, users communicate and aggregate information about products, prices, and deals. Many sites allow users to create custom shopping lists and share them with friends. To date, fashion communities have largely dominated this space. Yet, shopping communities are not limited exclusively to fashion. Some platforms like Zwibe are across all categories and actually pay the influencer if they make a sale in their group. Other shopping communities include Listia, an online community for free stuff. Activity-based clubs (such as travel or adventure-sports clubs) are the in-person analogy for this category of social shopping. # Recommendation engines allow shoppers to provide advice to fellow shoppers. The in-store analogy for this category of social shopping is asking a fellow shopper for advice. Traditional online product review companies such as Amazon have helped many consumers to date but currently emphasize obtaining and giving advice to strangers. Up and coming social shopping startups encourage conversations about purchases with a user's friends or acquaintance. # Social Shopping Marketplaces which bring sellers and buyers together to connect and transact like Shopcade, Polyvore, Storenvy, Etsy, SavelGo, and Impulse. The offline analogy for this category is a farmers market or bazaar. The marketplace brings together independent sellers and creates a forum for them to display and sell their wares to buyers. The marketplace affords buyers and sellers methods to connect and communicate whilst also performing the role of e-commerce facilitator for sellers and discovery engine for buyers. # Shared Shopping mechanisms for catalog-based e-commerce sites. These allow shoppers to form ad hoc collaborative shopping groups in which one person can drive an online shopping experience for one or more other people, using real- time communication among themselves and with the retailer. Benefits for retailers Social shopping sites may generate revenue not only from advertising and click throughs, but also by sharing information about their users with retailers. Some sites concentrate on the user interactions that pass on information and recommendations that are hard to acquire from sales personnel. Benefits for customers Social shopping sites motivate their users to participate in ways. Many sites offer nothing of specific value in return, relying on the user's intrinsic sense of social reward to share information with the community. Other sites offer tangible rewards for sharing information. Other sites offer incentives in the form of reputations points that can be redeemed for gifts. Extensions Social shopping can also exist in the real-world beyond the obvious swapping of consumer stories with people one knows. For example, when you walk into a dressing room, the mirror reflects your image, but you also see images of the apparel item and celebrities wearing it on an interactive display. A webcam also projects an image of the consumer wearing the item on the website for everyone to see. This creates an interaction between the consumers inside the store and their social network outside the store. The technology behind this system uses RFID. There are various ways for stores to use social shopping features. Some websites offer a combination of comparison shopping with social features. Others combine physical stores and social features, for example, allowing customers to share finds and deals from physical retailers through the phone and website and interact with users that have similar shopping interests. Some websites use established online social networks and tools rather than trying to build their own. By implementing applications like Facebook Connect which allow users to ask their Facebook friends' opinions on purchases directly on the social shopping site. Others implement the Twitter API, allowing their users to share content through tweets. Similarly, there are also social shopping applications that utilize existing networks to integrate users' social networks with shopping that aggregates sales offers from Instagram using the API.

Dyszel, known professionally as Dick Dyszel, is an American television personality, known for his television alter-egos Count Gore De Vol and Captain 20. Biography The Chicago native attended Southern Illinois University and graduated with a degree in radio-TV. He became the local Bozo the Clown at WDXR-TV in Paducah, Kentucky, before moving on to WDCA in Washington in 1972. He was a jack of all trades at WDCA, functioning as the station's announcer, as kids' show host Captain 20 as well as Washington's second Bozo, after Willard Scott had originated the local version of the character. The horror host character of Count Gore de Vol (whose name was either a play on author and (native Washingtonian) Gore Vidal or the name of a prominent Washington D.C. funeral home, \\"De Vol.\\") originated as a character called M.T. Graves on Bozo. He stayed on as the Count until 1987 when the station ceased local production. In 1998, Dyszel presented a weekly show on the Internet at Count Gore.com, featuring Count Gore hosting streaming video of movies and shorts as well as celebrity interviews. In 2005 he returned to the DC area, built a high-definition studio and expanded the role of Count Gore de Vol to include live-hosted horror movies at the AFI Silver Theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland. This series started on February 3, 2013, with the 40th anniversary celebration of his hosted horror movie on WDCA-TV‚ÄîHouse of Frankenstein!. He owns and operates Sounds Fabulous Entertainment, providing a virtual DJ system named George that he developed for small-venue parties. As Count Gore de Vol, he is a guest at 6 to 10 conventions a year and is closely associated with the Spooky Movie Film Festival, an annual week-long celebration of horror feature films and shorts, which celebrated its tenth year in 2015.

Upon absorption through the skin or mucous membranes, it acts as a neurotoxin by binding to and preventing the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium ion channels in heart, nerve, and skeletal muscle cell membranes. Veratridine increases nerve excitability and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Isolation Veratridine has been isolated from the seeds of Schoenocaulon officinale and from the rhizomes of Veratrum album. Like the other steroidal alkaloids found in these plants and similar ones in the Melanthiaceae family, it is present as part of a glycosidal combination, bonded to carbohydrate moieties. Early isolation methods relied on formation of the nitrate salt and then precipitation of the insoluble sulfate form. Accounts of these efforts date back to 1878, but the first true purification of veratridine is the one carried out in 1953 by Kupchan et al. This, and later purification procedures, begin with veratrine, a mixture of the alkaloids present in the Veratrum plants, primarily containing cevadine and veratridine. The nitrate salt is formed by dissolving the veratrine in 1% sulfuric acid over ice and precipitating with sodium nitrate. After resuspending in water over ice, the solution is brought to pH 8.5 with aqueous NaOH and then pH 10 with aqueous ammonia, forming another precipitate which is extracted with ether and then with chloroform. The ether and chloroform fractions are combined and dried. The dried residue is dissolved in sulfuric acid and the sulfate salt of veratridine is precipitated by dropwise addition of a solution of ammonium sulfate. Finally, the free base form is generated with ammonium hydroxide. An even better isolation of veratridine from veratrine is achieved using high- performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); as commercially available veratridine may vary in purity, HPLC purification of veratrine is a preferred method for isolation of veratridine for biological studies. Chemistry  Structure  Veratridine is a derivative, the 3-veratroate ester, of veracevine, which belongs to the class of C-nor-D-homosteroidal alkaloids. The molecular structure and stereochemistry of this and related alkaloids were only established after decades of chemical investigations. The structure of veratridine has been confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Veratridine displays an unusual steroidal backbone. In the typical four-ring nucleus with three six-membered rings and one five-membered ring (like the one in cholesterol), the five-membered ring is on the end. Veratridine, and other Veratrum alkaloids, have the five-membered ring between the second and third six-membered rings.  Solubility  Veratridine has a pKa of 9.54. It is slightly soluble in ether, soluble in ethanol and DMSO, and freely soluble in chloroform. Solubility in water is pH-dependent; the free base form is slightly soluble, but easily dissolves in 1 M HCl. Its nitrate salt is slightly soluble in water. Its sulfate salt is very hygroscopic.  Mechanism of action and applications  Veratridine binds at an intracellular site that covers parts of both domain I and domain IV of the voltage-gated sodium ion channel. Veratridine acts a neurotoxin by increasing nerve excitability. It binds to binding site 2 on the voltage-gated sodium channels (the same site bound by batrachotoxin, aconitine, and grayanotoxin), leading to persistent activation. Veratridine inhibits sodium channel inactivation by shifting the activation threshold toward a more negative potential. The resulting influx of Na+ also leads to the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, causing the overproduction of reactive oxygen species responsible for neuronal damage. Veratridine is readily absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes and through ingestion. The tissues most affected are the heart, nerves, and skeletal muscles: main symptoms of veratridine toxicity include severe nausea, bradycardia, hypotension, difficulty breathing, salivation, and muscle weakness. Treatment involves the administration of activated charcoal, atropine, and benzodiazepines (if the affected individual is seizing). Veratridine's ability to depolarize cells by affecting sodium channels lends it its applicability as a neuropharmacological tool for the study of electrical properties of nerve and muscle fibers. It has also been tested as a treatment for myasthenia gravis, in light of its potential to increase muscle responses to motor neuron stimulation. Furthermore, this compound has recently been reported to increase sperm progressive motility (although it does not produce hyperactivation by itself). It has the potential of enhancing protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which takes place during capacitation, and its eÔ¨Äects are inhibited in the presence of lidocaine and tetrodotoxin. Veratridine has not been reported to have any eÔ¨Äect on the acrosome reaction on its own, but it is able to block the progesterone-induced acrosome reaction. Moreover, veratridine has the effect of turning the membrane potential to a more positive one and also modiÔ¨Åes the eÔ¨Äect of progesterone on [Ca2+]i and sperm membrane potential. The activation of Nav1.8 is a key point in Veratradine's mechanism of action and, consequently, this sodium ion channel coordinates the effects of this compound. Veratradine also activates additional Nav channels. These facts contribute to support the importance of these Veratradine-sensitive proteins in the regulation of mature sperm function, such as human sperm fertility acquisition regulating motility, capacitation and the progesterone-induced acrosome reaction.L. Candenas, F.M. Pinto, A. Cejudo-Rom√°n, C. Gonz√°lez-Ravina, M. Fern√°ndez-S√°nchez, N. P√©rez- Hern√°ndez, et al. Veratridine-sensitive Na+ channels regulate human sperm fertilization capacity.

Life and career Gilbert was born in Hamburg into a family of musicians; his ancestors were cantors of the Jewish community, his cousin Paul Dessau became a famous composer and conductor. He attended composition lessons held by Philipp Scharwenka in Berlin and studied at the conservatories in Sondershausen and Weimar. After first public appearances as a pianist, the 18-year-old obtained an appointment as Kapellmeister in Bremerhaven. Soon after he moved to the Carl Schultze Theater in Hamburg and, at the age of 20, succeeded Leo Fall as musical director of the Centralhalle theatre. He adopted the name of Jean Gilbert for the production of his first operetta Das Jungfernstift in 1901. He continued to work as a Kapellmeister at the Berlin Apollo-Theater on Friedrichstra√üe, where he enacted operettas by Paul Lincke. In 1908, Gilbert moved to D√ºsseldorf and again turned to composing. Back in Berlin by 1910, he composed more than 50 operettas before and after World War I. His most successful work was Die keusche Susanne (1910), which was also popular in an English adaptation as The Girl in the Taxi. As a Jew, Gilbert was forced to leave Germany after the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933. He first emigrated to Madrid and later to Argentina, where he once again worked as a radio orchestra leader. He died in Buenos Aires. His elder son Robert Gilbert (1899‚Äì1978) was also a composer, his younger son Henry Winterfeld (1901‚Äì1990) became a well-known author of books for young readers.

He is well known in Iceland, Eastern and Central Europe and among Canadians of different origins for his translations of national poetry, particularly from Hungarian, Ukrainian, Russian and Serbo-Croatian. He collaborated with distinguished scholars and academics of his time in perfecting the translations, including literary critic Pavle Popoviƒá. One of his most remarkable translations is The Bards of Wales, a poem of Hungarian poet J√°nos Arany. After World War II, Kirkconnell wrote a poem about Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, alleging that the Serb general's execution on July 17, 1946 at the hands of Josip Broz Tito's victorious Yugoslav Partisans had followed a show trial and that charges of terrorist war crimes against civilians and of Chetnik collaboration with occupying Italian and German Axis forces had been trumped up. The execution solidified Communist rule in Yugoslavia for the next four decades, before the federal state ultimately disintegrated into civil war after Tito's death, when latent internal tensions were no longer being suppressed. From 1948 to 1964, he was the ninth President of Acadia University. He was also on numerous occasions shortlisted for the prestigious Nobel Prize. In 1968, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada \\"for his services at home and abroad as an educator, scholar and writer\\". In 1936, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

It is bounded on three sides by rivers, the River Shannon, the River Lusmagh and the Little Brosna River. It is also a Roman Catholic parish, in the Diocese of Clonfert, the only parish in the Diocese east of the River Shannon. Prior to 1373, Lusmagh was in the province of Connacht.Banagher - A Brief History, Banagher Parish Council, June 1957. According to the history of the O'Kellys of Hy-Many, the name means the plain of the healing herbs.Weston Joyce, P., Irish Local Names Explained, 1870. In Christian times, the parish was named Cill Mochonna (the Church of Mochonna), after Saint Mochonna. Saint Cr√≥n√°n founded a monastery in the parish that survived for many centuries. The name Lusmagh was restored to the Parish around 1810. The present Roman Catholic parish church is named after St. Cr√≥n√°n. Cloghan Castle Cloghan Castle Cloghan Castle was originally built as a monastery by St. Cr√≥n√°n in 600. The Normans fortified the remains of the monastery in 1203 by building a defensive wall around it, a part of which still exists. The Gaelic Chieftain Eoghan O‚ÄôMadden constructed the castle keep in 1336.Thompson, B.D., Cloghan Castle, Lusmagh, Banagher, Ireland: 1400 years of living history, 1994. His kingdom stretched to the west as far as Loughrea in County Galway. The castle was attacked and razed in 1595 by Sir William Russell, the Lord Deputy, and confiscated for the Crown.Lewis, S., A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, 1837. It was granted, together with 6,000 acres, to Sir John Moore in 1601 and he was responsible for the existing oak beamed roof. Sir John was sacked from his Government post when it was discovered that he was a Catholic. The castle remained in the Moore family until it was taken by Cromwellian soldiers in 1654. They remained in residence until 1683 when King Charles II granted it to Garret Moore. It was garrisoned by the Jacobites in 1689 and 1690 and remains of their gun emplacements can still be seen in the grounds. The Moores were good landlords and tried their best to alleviate the suffering of their tenants in the Great Famine of 1845 to 1847. As a result of the Famine, the Moores became bankrupt and had to sell the lands. It was purchased by Dr. Robert Graves, the Dublin Doctor who discovered Graves Disease of the thyroid, at the insistence of his wife.Cooke, Jim, The Graves Family in Ireland, Dublin Historical Record (Old Dublin Society) 50 (1): 25‚Äì39, 1997. He died a year after purchasing the castle. After his death, his widow evicted up to 100 tenants from the property.Lusmagh, County Offaly, Ireland, Killeens of Dublin Ireland. Retrieved on 27 January 2013. His grandson sold it in 1908 before emigrating to Australia, where his descendants still live. The land of Lusmagh was eventually taken over by the Land Commission, and divided among the local tenant farmers around 1910. People Lusmagh was the birthplace of Michael Larkin (1837‚Äì1867) one of the three Manchester Martyrs. He was born on the properties of Cloghan Castle, the entrance of which is just past St. Cronan's Church and parish house. Hurling Lusmagh is probably best known for its hurling tradition. Joachim Kelly, Brendan Bermingham, Jim Troy, Brendan Kelly, Pat Temple and John Troy have all won All-Ireland Senior Hurling medals with Offaly as well as numerous provincial titles. Brendan Kelly, Ronald Byrne and John Troy have also won All-Ireland Minor medals, with John Troy having the distinction of being one of only three men in the history of the GAA to win three all-Ireland Minor medals. Lusmagh GAA club won their one and only County Senior title in 1989, having been promoted from the Junior ranks in 1973. They defeated Seir Kieran in the final by one point. Joachim, Jim and John Kelly and Brendan Bermingham figured on both the successful teams of 1973 and 1989. Lusmagh have also won two All-Ireland 11-a-side titles, an annual club competition which is held in Carlow, beating neighbours St.Rynagh's of Banagher in the inaugural competition in 1990 and Ferns in 2000. In popular culture In 1908, Edward Dolan, who was 20 years old, left Lusmagh as an emigrant to Australia. On the long journey he wrote a song about the pain of emigration and of parting from his native land, which he enclosed with his first, and only, letter home. He was never heard from again, but news has recently surfaced of his life. He worked for the railways in the Northern Territory in Darwin circa 1923‚Äì30. He was also a founder member of the Wheat Growers Union in Western Australia in 1930 to enable small scale farmers to join together to get a better deal as they were being thrown off their farms by the government of the day. This union was very much left leaning and closely allied to the Australian Labour party. It finally morphed into Cooperative Bulk Handling which is the backbone of all wheat handling in Western Australia to this day. Edward or \\"Ned\\" passed away in 1956 aged 69.

Although born in the United States, he spent a large amount of his youth in Japan. After graduating from University of California at Berkeley, Kubose moved back to Japan where he began studying under his spiritual instructor Haya Akegarasu, who was in turn a student of Kiyozawa Manshi, a Meiji-era reformer of Shin Buddhism. Kubose was a non-sectarian Buddhist and followed Kiyozawa's message that Buddhism should be implemented as a personal voyage, and not merely a communal tradition as it had become prior to the Meiji era. He also extended a great amount of influence in North America, and traveled much of the United States on his lecture tours. In addition to the Buddhist Temple of Chicago, he also established the American Buddhist Association, the Buddhist Education Centre in Chicago, and other related works. He extended the Buddhist ideal that duality was an illusion created by egotism, and that originally everything was one. Many of his lectures and teachings focus upon this, using a juxtaposition that oneness and individuality can coexist, provided one does not allow the ego to get in the way. Another focus of his was the extension of Kiyozawa's message, that Buddhism should be a personal experience and that it was not merely enough to go to the temple and recite sutras. The experience had to come from within, or there was no substance. To that end, Kubose placed the Buddha in the same field as Socrates, in that Buddhism was a philosophy first, and a religion second. The intention was that philosophy is something a person contemplates anew, and while they may rely on the teachings of the religious tradition, the practise of realising oneness and thereby Enlightenment must be their own. Today, Gyomay Kubose is succeeded by his son, Koyo Kubose, named his spiritual successor in 1998.

As the local population were being cleared off the land they had worked for centuries by the Lords of the Land, survival was a problem and so it was built to keep the locals in labour. It was said that Sir Hector rolled stones from the top of the hill to the bottom, thereby extending the amount of time worked and paying the labourers for additional hours. It represents the Gate of Negapatam, a port in Madras, India, which General Munro took for the British in 1781. It is visible from almost anywhere in the parishes of Kiltearn and Alness.

Three of them are a generation older than Tony Soprano: Soprano caporegime Michele \\"Feech\\" La Manna, Lupertazzi consigliere Angelo Garepe, and Lupertazzi capo Phil Leotardo. The fourth is Tony's cousin, Tony \\"Tony B\\" Blundetto. Feech wishes to return to work as a shy and sports bettor, which Tony and Uncle Junior will permit if he doesn't \\"step on anyone's toes.\\" Tony is excited about his cousin's release and plans a lavish welcome party. Christopher Moltisanti and Paulie Gualtieri confront each other when their humorous re-telling of the \\"Pine Barrens\\" ordeal devolves into mutual recriminations. Chris is beginning to resent the custom that, being of lower rank, he should pay when the group dine in a restaurant. One evening, he forces Paulie to pay. Next morning, Paulie demands that Chris repay him and threatens that \\"points\\" will be added. Tony orders Chris to keep paying the tabs, as he himself once did. In Atlantic City, Paulie contrives to inflate a dinner bill to nearly $1,200. As they argue in the parking lot, a waiter confronts Chris about his small tip. Insults are traded and Chris throws a brick at the waiter‚Äôs head. The waiter collapses and has a seizure, causing a panicked Paulie to kill him with a gunshot to the chest. Paulie grabs the $1,200 and he and Chris speed off in their cars. The next day, they agree to bury the hatchet and split the original tab. Carmine Lupertazzi has a stroke. At the hospital, Johnny Sack indicates to Tony that he is still angry that he backed out of their deal to kill Carmine the previous year. Janice and Bobby Baccalieri are now married. About a year after his separation, Tony is living in his mother's former home. One evening, while A.J. is in his parents' backyard, a large black bear appears; terrified, he cries, \\"Mommy!\\" Carmela drives off the bear and calls the authorities. Tony comes round the next day and talks to Carmela, but the meeting turns acrimonious when she criticizes him for buying A.J. too many gifts. Arguing about money, she accuses him of calling Italy on his cellphone; he says that Furio Giunta's life is finished if certain people find him. Tony tasks Benny Fazio and Little Paulie Germani to guard his backyard, and Carmela reluctantly supplies them with an AK-47. After watching The Prince of Tides with his mistress, Valentina La Paz, Tony wants to see Dr. Jennifer Melfi again. He sends flowers and a greeting card to her office. When he calls her to set up a date, she declines, feeling that it would be unprofessional to date a former patient. She has a sexual dream about him. Tony then makes an appointment, a pretext so that he can tell her he loves her, and he forcibly kisses her. In a therapy session with her own psychiatrist, she admits her initial attraction to Tony. He makes a third attempt to court her by offering cruise tickets, but she declines again. At his request, she tells him the aspects of his character she could not accept. But these are things he cannot bear to hear and, calling her a \\"cunt,\\" he storms out. He goes home, in a sense, and takes up bear duty from Benny.

A member of the Polish nobility (szlachta), bearing the hereditary Junosza coat-of-arms, he is most famous as co-founder of the Za≈Çuski Library, one of the largest 18th-century book collections in the world. Life Together with his brother Andrzej Stanis≈Çaw Za≈Çuski he was raised by their uncles (Andrzej Chryzostom Za≈Çuski, bishop of Warmia, and Ludwik Za≈Çuski, bishop of P≈Çock). J√≥zef was educated in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (Warsaw, Gda≈Ñsk, Krak√≥w) as well as abroad (Sorbonne in Paris). He took Holy Orders in 1727. In his career he was a Great Crown Referendary (referendarz wielki koronny) from 1728 and canon of Krak√≥w. As a supporter of King Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski he accompanied him to France in the 1730s, where he was a royal chaplain in the royal court of Leszczy≈Ñski's wife, Queen Katarzyna Opali≈Ñska. He controlled some of the Church's property in France; after his return to Poland he became the abbot of WƒÖchock. In 1759 he became the bishop of Kiev and in 1762 he led the synod of the diocese. He was active on the Polish political scene, opposing King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, as well as the interference of the Russian empire in Polish domestic matters. For that, in 1767 (at the Repnin Sejm) he was arrested by Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin, and until 1773 he was imprisoned in Kaluga, Russia. The greatest passion of Za≈Çuski's brothers was books. Together with his brother Andrzej Stanis≈Çaw Za≈Çuski (1695‚Äì1758, bishop of Krak√≥w and crown chancellor) he obtained the collections of such previous Polish bibliophiles as Jakub Zadzik, Krzysztof Opali≈Ñski, Tomasz Ujejski, Janusz Wi≈õniowiecki, Jerzy Mniszech and Jan III Sobieski. From the 1730s they planned the creation of a library and in 1747 the brothers founded the Za≈Çuski's Library (Biblioteka Za≈Çuskich), considered to be the first Polish public library and one of the largest libraries in the world at the time. Located in Dani≈Çowiczowski Palace in Warsaw, it was one of the world's finest libraries, with a collection of about 400,000 printed items and manuscripts. After the death of its founders, the Za≈Çuski brothers, the newly formed National Education Commission took charge of the library, renaming it the Za≈Çuski Brothers Library of the Republic. Twenty years later in 1794, in the aftermath of the second Partition of Poland and Ko≈õciuszko Uprising, Russian troops, on orders from Russian Czarina Catherine II, plundered the library and took its collection to Saint Petersburg, where the Imperial Public Library was formed a year later. Za≈Çuski was an important member of the Enlightenment in Poland, one of the founders of the Polish Literary Society (Towarzystwo Literat√≥w) in 1765. He convinced Stanis≈Çaw Konarski to start his work on Volumina legum, eight comprehensive volumes of Sejm legislation up to date, continued after his death and reaching eight volumes by 1786. He was co-publisher of Warschauer Bibilothek (1753‚Äì1758). He supported the writer Benedykt Chmielowski, historian Gottfried Lengnich, and sponsored the publication of many foreign books and magazines. He was also a translator himself, translating French dramas. He was the author of works from the fields of theology, history and library science (Bibliotheca poetarum Polonorum (1752, 1754), Bibliotheca Polona magnauniversalis (manuscript destroyed in 1944)). After his death, the Bishopric of Kiev was taken by Ignacy Franciszek Ossoli≈Ñski.

The modern Games at Inverness have their origin in meetings held in 1821. That year, the Inverness Courier reported that fundraising was taking place in the town by members of the Northern Meeting Society in order to revive the ancient traditions and to bring a Highland games event to the capital of the Highlands. The Games took place in October 1822at the end of a summer which saw numerous Highland Gatherings taking place across Scotland as part of the celebrations that were being held to mark the visit by King George IV. The 1822 Games held in Inverness were called a \\"True Highland Games\\" and featured three cows killed by sledgehammer in order for a competition to take place between teams of men to see who could pull a leg off one of the unfortunate animals the fastest and win a prize of five guineas. The 1822 Games also featured an unknown Stonemason pushing a 252-pound weight over a bar suspended 5 feet above the ground; and this unique challenge was revived in 2013. In 2006 Inverness hosted the Masters World Championships which was being held in Europe for the first time. In 2007 Inverness hosted the World Highland Games Heavy Championshipswhich was being staged on Scottish soil for the first time since it was staged in Kilmarnock in 1995. The World Championship was won by Gregor Edmunds of Scotland with Larry Brock and Ryan Vierra of the USA finishing in second and third positions. In 2009 the Masters World Championships returned to Inverness for the second time and took place the week before \\"The Gathering\\" celebrations organised as the centre piece of Scotland's Year of Homecoming. Organisation From 1822 to 1938 the Highland Games staged in Inverness were organised by the members of Northern Meeting. Northern Meeting Park was the venue for Highland Games organised in Inverness by the Northern Meeting Society from 1864 to 1938. In July 1939 the Northern Meeting Society decided that they wished to stop organising the Games after losing money for nine years. It was agreed that the Inverness Shopkeepers Association would be invited to take over the running of the Games but plans for a September 1939 event was abandoned as a result of the outbreak of the Second World War. The Games were staged in Northern Meeting Park for a final time in 1948 before it was decided that they would be moved to Bught Park. Today the Games are organised by the Highland Council in partnership with a Committee of volunteers. In 2010 the Games returned to the smaller Northern Meeting Park in preparation for celebrations to mark the 150th Anniversary of the World's oldest Highland Games stadium in 2014. The 2014 celebrations featured the introduction of a Strongman and Strongwoman's event and two Highland Games in the same year for the first time. The regular Games were staged in July and the Masters World Championships were hosted in September. The September Games featured more Heavies than any other Games in history with 157 athletes from 14 countries taking part. The September Games ended with a Guinness World Record for Simultaneous Caber Tossingbeing established with 66 of the 110 Cabers thrown being successfully launched into the air at the same time and turning correctly. The following year a Gala Day was added to the Games weekend programme as the main Games returned down the River Ness to Bught Park where it is now based. In 2019 the Games weekend was expanded to include the Proud Ness LGBT Community Gathering which was attended by 10,000https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/inverness/1782971/proud-ness- to-celebrate-we-are-family-theme-for-2019-march/. https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/inverness/1801518/proud-ness-crowds- are-estimated-as-being-among-biggest-in-scotland/The Games were cancelled in 2020 due to the Coved-19 Pandemic.https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/inverness/2077801/julys- inverness-highland-games-cancelled-after-government-issues-coronavirus-advice/ References External links *Official website * Masters website * Inverness Events Official website Category:Highland games Category:Sport in Inverness Category:Culture in Inverness Category:Highland games in Scotland Category:Multi-sport events in the United Kingdom ","title":"Inverness Highland Games"},{"id":"4480400","text":"Hepborn, circa 1904 George T.

It was first described in 1982 by Perle, Teresa Marya≈Ñska and Osm√≥lska for a disarticulated skeleton with most of a skull, part of the forelimb and hindlimb, some of the pelvic girdle, and some vertebrae. Perle et al. named the remains Goyocephale lattimorei, from the Mongolian goyo, meaning \\"decorated\\", and the Ancient Greek kephale, for head. The species name honours Owen Lattimore. Description Life restoration Goyocephale is known from a partial skull, including both mandibles, the skull roof, part of the occiput, part of the braincase region, the posterior skull, the premaxilla, and the maxilla. The posterior edge of the skull roof, at the edge of the squamosal bones, has many small bony bumps, which would have been the base of small horns in life. A feature shared with pachycephalosaurids, Goyocephale had a heterodont dentition, with large caniniform premaxilla teeth, followed by a diastema between the premaxilla and the maxilla, and the regular sub- triangular teeth in the maxilla. Teeth in the premaxilla become larger farther posterior, with the last being the largest. The mandible teeth are similar, with the first tooth being caniniform, and the remainder low and sub- triangular. Of the vertebrae, only the atlas bone (the first cervical vertebra) and the sacrum and tail vertebrae are preserved. The sacrum includes four vertebrae, which are not strongly fused and incomplete. On the ventral surface of the second sacral centrum is a length-wise ridge, with a groove along its midline. The first and second tail vertebrae were found articulated with the sacrum, although they are much weakly fused than the sacral vertebrae. In addition, they can be distinguished from the sacrum because they possess zygapophyses that are not fused together, although they also preserve a ventral groove. The limb and girdle bones are well-preserved, and show many features. The humerus is strongly bowed, with a nearly equal expansion on the distal and proximal ends. It also shows a thick but weak deltopectoral crest (anterior projection on the humerus), and weakly separated condyles on the distal end. The ilium bone shows a morphology typical for pachycephalosaurs, with a thin and horizontally elongate preacetabular process (front extension of the ilium), and a wide ridge extending outwards from the top edge of the postacetabular process (hind ilium extension). Also, the two preacetabular processes are strongly diverged in dorsal view, and in lateral view the ilium is almost straight and the postacetabular process is sub-rectangular. The tibia shows a pachycephalosaur design, and no tarsal bones appear to be articulated. The foot of Goyocephale is partially preserved, and at least three digits (digits II, III and IV) were present. On each toe, the unguals are triangular but not recurved, with the ungulate of the third toe being the largest. Classification Skeletal reconstruction, by Jaime Headden Goyocephale is a primitive pachycephalosaurian, and was originally included in the family Homalocephalidae, which united the genus with Homalocephale, which also has a flat skull roof. Goyocephale is distinguished from Homalocephale by its overall proportions, the shape of its supratemporal fenestra, and heterodont dentition, although the two share multiple features. However, many more recent phylogenetic analyses tend to find Homalocephalidae to be a paraphyletic family, with the genera included simply being consecutive branches sister to Pachycephalosauridae, or as consecutive branches primitive to Prenocephale but within Pachycephalosauridae. A cladogram illustrating the latter hypothesis is shown below. Skull roof, lateral view However, one phylogenetic analysis did support a monophyletic Homalocephalidae, with Goyocephale, Homalocephale and Wannanosaurus being the most derived pachycephalosaurians, and their sister taxa being Prenocephale and Tylocephale. This positioning of all the taxa from Asia as most derived would support that pachycephalosaurians evolved in North America, where they retained their greatest diversity, before migrating to Asia. In addition, the oldest genera that belong in the group are North American, which provides further support for this position.

Stubbornly, she put a decade into telling this story, learning as much from the family as she was able to dig up herself. The book went through three publishing houses and four editors.\\" Skloot and Henrietta's daughter Deborah formed a link in the writing of this book, which Deborah sees as her mother's hand guiding them. Skloot is described as an atheist. Her second book, exploring the science and ethics of human‚Äìanimal relationships, was put under contract with Crown Publishing Group in 2011. Her past work with animals in shelters, as a vet tech, in research facilities, and at an animal morgue prompted her interest in the ethical controversies surrounding animal use for science. She discussed the topics of the book at the Chicago Humanities Festival in 2013. She spoke with researchers at Harvard University about it in 2015.

Like their contemporaries The Last Poets, the group combined elements of jazz music and spoken-word performance, making the trio one that is often seen as a forerunner of contemporary hip-hop music. Formed in 1967, the group comprised Richard Dedeaux, Father Amde Hamilton (born Anthony Hamilton), and Otis O'Solomon (also billed as Otis O'Solomon Smith) (O'Solomon removed the \\"Smith\\" from his name in the 1970s). History Hamilton, O'Solomon, and Dedeaux first met and collaborated at the Watts Writers Workshop, an organization created by Budd Schulberg in the wake of the Watts Riots, as the Civil Rights Movement was beginning to take a new cultural turn. Fusing music with jazz and funk roots, and rapid-fire, spoken-word poetry, they created a sound that gave them a considerable local following. They released two albums, 1969's The Black Voices: On the Streets in Watts and 1971's Rappin' Black in a White World, which established a strong tendency toward social commentary and a reputation for militancy. The group was unable to secure another record deal; a promising deal with Bob Marley's Tuff Gong label famously fell through. Unable to sustain success, the group has performed only sporadically since the mid-1970s. In recent years, the group's profile has improved somewhat. The 1997 recording, When the 90's Came, found them in the studio with pianist Horace Tapscott, and a European tour reunited the trio with former collaborator DeeDee McNeil. In 2005, Things Gonna Get Greater: The Watts Prophets 1969-1971 combined the group's first two efforts, bringing them back into print for the first time in more than a decade. Amde Hamilton, who is a priest of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church can be seen performing a spoken-word piece at the 1981 funeral service of Bob Marley in Jamaica in the 1982 film Land of Look Behind. In 1994, the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool, appearing on a track entitled \\"Apprehension\\" alongside Don Cherry (trumpeter). The album, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic in African-American society was named \\"Album of the Year\\" by Time Magazine. Richard Dedeaux died in December 2013.

Administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, it encompasses of land, and as 2014, had over 11,000 interments.  History  During the American Civil War, the territory around the city of Culpeper was defended vigorously by both sides, as it was a strategic point almost exactly between Washington D.C. and the capital of the Confederacy, Richmond, Virginia. Numerous battles took place in the region, including the Battle of Cedar Mountain and the Battle of Chancellorsville. The dead from those conflicts were buried nearby in makeshift grave sites. After the war a reburial program was initiated, and in 1867, Culpeper National Cemetery was established to reinter many of the remains from the makeshift sites. The original cemetery comprised , bought from Edward B. Hill of Culpeper for $1,400. The original Second Empire Victorian caretakers lodge was built in 1872 and was designed by Montgomery C. Meigs. Many improvements to the grounds and facilities at the cemetery were made during the 1930s as part of the New Deal. These make-work improvements included replacing the original 1870s tool house at the cost of $8,000 in 1934, raising and realigning 912 headstones in May 1934, by the Civil Works Administration, and realignment and re-setting 402 headstones in 1936 though a Works Project Administration project. Having operated without any major improvements since the 1930s, the cemetery was closed to new interments on November 17, 1972. On September 1, 1973, administration of the cemetery was transferred from the U.S. Army to the Veterans Administration's new National Cemetery System created by the National Cemetery Act of 1973. In 1975 another was donated by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Burton-Hammond Post 2524, and in 2001 another plot of was purchased, which has been developed for future interments. The cemetery was reopened to interments on January 16, 1978. Culpeper National Cemetery was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. It is included in the South East Street Historic District.  Notable monuments  * The states of Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania have erected markers dedicated to regiments from those states who had members die in the Battle of Cedar Mountain. ** The Maine monument is of granite construction and is dedicated to the 22 officers and soldiers from the 10th Maine Volunteer Infantry who died at Cedar Mountain. ** The Massachusetts monument was erected by members of the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry in 1893. ** The New York monument was erected in 1902 to honor the members of the 28th New York Volunteer Infantry, 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 12th Corps, Army Corps of the Potomac who died at Cedar Mountain. ** The Ohio monument is of granite and bronze construction and was erected by the 7th Ohio Regimental Association. ** The Pennsylvania monument was erected in 1910. * The Armed Forces Monument was erected November 1992 and was sponsored by the American Legion Post 330 and Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2524.

He was the youngest of the eight brothers of the dynasty's founder Ugrasena (also known as Mahapadma Nanda). Chanakya, a Brahmin who was insulted by him, vowed to overthrow him, and raised an army that invaded the Nanda capital Pataliputra and killed him. Chanakya then installed his own protege Chandragupta Maurya on the throne. The Jain tradition presents a similar legend about the last Nanda emperor, although it simply calls the emperor \\"Nanda\\", and states that the emperor was allowed to leave his capital alive after being defeated. The Puranas give a different account, describing the last Nanda emperor as one of eight sons of the dynasty's founder, whom they call Mahapadma. The Greco-Roman accounts name Alexander's contemporary ruler in India as Agrammes or Xandrames, whom modern historians identify as the last Nanda emperor. According to these accounts, Alexander's soldiers mutinied when faced with the prospect of a war with this emperor's powerful army. The Greek accounts describe Agrammes as the ruler of the Gangaridai (the Ganges valley) and the Prasii (probably a transcription of the Sanskrit word prachyas, literally \\"easterners\\"). When faced with the prospect of facing the powerful army of this ruler, Alexander's soldiers mutinied, forcing him to retreat from India. Life Indian kings Porus and Phegeles (Bhagala) are said to have informed Alexander III of Macedon of the unpopularity of Nanda among his subjects. The army of Nanda is described by Quintus Curtius Rufus, roman historian, as 200,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalry, 2,000 four-horsed chariots and 3,000 elephants. Nanda's chief minister was Sakadala who had two sons, Sthulabhadra (297-198 BCE) and Srikaya. Srikaya became the king's personal bodygaurd. Sthulabhadra loved the royal dancer Rupakosa and lived for 12 years with her. Sakadala was killed in a plot of his political opponent Varichi, after which, his son Srikaya was made the chief minister. The Greek accounts describe Agrammes as the ruler of the Gangaridai (the Ganges valley) and the Prasii (probably a transcription of the Sanskrit word prachyas, literally \\"easterners\\"). When faced with the prospect of facing the powerful army of Nanda, Alexander's soldiers mutinied, forcing him to retreat from India.  In Buddhist tradition  The Buddhist text Mahavamsa names 9 Nanda kings, who were all brothers, and ruled in succession for a total of 22 years. The first of these kings was Ugrasena, and the last was Dhana Nanda: The Buddhist tradition does not state that Dhana Nanda insulted the Brahmin Chanakya for his ugly appearance during an alms-giving ceremony at Pupphapura (Pushpapura), ordering him to be thrown out of the assembly. Chanakya then cursed the king, who ordered his arrest. Chanakya escaped and befriended the king's son Pabbata, instigating the prince to seize the throne. With help of a signet ring given by the prince, Chanakya fled the Nanda palace. Determined to overthrow Dhana Nanda, he acquired wealth to raise an army by using a secret technique that allowed him to turn 1 coin into 8 coins. Chanakya narrowed down two candidates to replace Dhana Nanda: Pabbata, and Chandragupta, who belonged to a former royal family. To test them, he gave each of them an amulet to be worn around the neck with a woolen thread. One day, while Chandragupta was asleep, he asked Pabbata to remove Chandragupta's woolen thread without breaking it and without waking up Chandragupta. Pabbata failed to accomplish this task. Some time later, when Pabbata was sleeping, Chanakya challenged Chandragupta to complete the same task. Chandragupta retrieved the woolen thread by cutting off Pabbata's head. Over next seven years, Chanakya trained and mentored Chandragupta. When Chandragupta became an adult, Chanakya assembled an army using his wealth. The army invaded Dhana Nanda's capital, but was decisively defeated and disbanded. Subsequently, Chandragupta and Chanakya raised a new army, and started capturing the border villages. Gradually, they advanced to the Nanda capital Pataliputta (Pataliputra), and killed Dhana Nanda. Chanakya found the treasure of Dhana Nanda through a fisherman, and appointed Chandragupta as the new king.  Other descriptions of the last Nanda king   Jain tradition  The Jain tradition contains a legend that has several similarities with the Buddhist legend, but does not mention the name \\"Dhana Nanda\\": the Jain texts simply call Chanakya's rival king \\"Nanda\\". According to the Jain tradition, Chanakya visited the Nanda capital Pataliputra to seek donations from the king, but felt insulted by a servant of the king. He then vowed to overthrow the Nanda dynasty. He discovered and mentored Chandragupta, and raised an army that defeated the Nanda forces after an initial debacle. However, unlike the Buddhist tradition , the Jain tradition states that the Nanda king was allowed to leave his capital alive after being defeated. The king's daughter fell in love with Chandragupta and married him. This daughter is not named, although later, the mother of Chandragupta's son Bindusara is named Durdhara.  Puranas  Like the Buddhist tradition, the Puranas also state that there were 9 Nanda kings. However, they name the first of these kings as Mahapadma, and state that the next 8 kings were his sons. The Puranas name only one of these sons: Sukalpa. Dhundiraja, a commentator on the Vishnu Purana, claims that Chandragupta Maurya was the grandson of a Nanda king called Sarvatha-siddhi, although this claim does not occur in the Puranas themselves.  Greco-Roman accounts  The Greek accounts name Alexander's contemporary ruler in India as Agrammes or Xandrames, whom modern historians identify as the last Nanda king. \\"Agrammes\\" may be a Greek transcription of the Sanskrit word \\"Augrasainya\\" (literally \\"son or descendant of Ugrasena\\", Ugrasena being the name of the dynasty's founder according to the Buddhist tradition). The Greco-Roman tradition suggests that this dynasty had only two kings: according to Curtius, the dynasty's founder was a barber-turned-king; his son was overthrown by Chandragupta Maurya.  In popular culture  Dhana Nanda appears as the primary antagonist in almost every series on Indian television portraying the life of Chanakya or Chandragupta Maurya. *In the epic historical drama Chanakya (TV series), Suraj Chaddha portrays the role of Dhana Nanda. * In Porus (TV series), Saurabh Raj Jain essays the role of Dhana Nanda. * In Chandragupta Maurya (2011 TV series), Sooraj Thapar portrays Dhana Nanda.

The band was formed initially by Johansson, Carlsson and Jocke in 1998 after the departure of Terminal Grip since 1997. History In early 2005 it was announced that Paganizer was finished; however, soon the band was activated once again, in the Johansson/Fiebig/Halvarsson lineup. Many members, including Rogga, are also involved in the band Ribspreader. On October 28, 2008, Paganizer was signed with Cyclone Empire Records and released their album Scandinavian Warmachine on April 17th, 2009. Paganizer's long-time recorded last album, Carnage Junki, was finally released via Vic Records on November 2009. On May 6, 2013, the band has announced their latest studio album titled World Lobotomy that was released on May 10 2010 via Cyclone Empire. Later that year, Paganizer canceled some upcoming shows, publicly blaming Andreas 'Dea' Carlsson. Dennis Blomberg replaced Carlsson as their new guitarist.  Critical reception  The band is known for its adherence to the classic style of Swedish death metal. Singer and guitarist Johansson is a prolific musician in the genre, and the band's sound is sometimes attributed to his influence. Some critics have noted that the band moved toward a sound more heavy in melodic elements in their 2019 album The Tower of the Morbid, mixing this more melodic approach with core elements of Swedish death metal. Others dismiss the band for its lack of originality, while still praising the strong songwriting and production, as well as the band's enjoyability for those who are inherently partial to the genre.

The original title for the compilation was Blueprint for Extinction, but after the death of Nasum frontman Mieszko Talarczyk, the remaining band members felt that the word \\"extinction\\" made the title inappropriate. The band started to think of a play on words with \\"Grind\\" somewhere in the title, and ended up with \\"Grind Finale\\" since it would be the final major release from Nasum.

Yuri's Day in the Autumn, celebrated after the end of the agricultural year and the gathering of the harvest, had a special significance on the calendar of Russian peasants during the centuries when the system of Russian serfdom was becoming established. The Sudebnik of 1497 defined the two weeks' period around the Autumn Yuri's Day (one week before the feast and one week after it), as the only time of the year when Russian peasants were free to move from one landowner to another. A century later, in 1597, Boris Godunov's regency forbade the movement of peasants on Yuri's day, thus finalizing the evolution of Russian serfdom. A popular Russian expression harking back to that unfortunate event still survives (\\"–≤–æ—Ç —Ç–µ–±–µ, –±–∞–±—É—à–∫–∞, –∏ –Æ—Ä—å–µ–≤ –¥–µ–Ω—å\\", roughly translated: \\"so much for Yuri's Day, Granny\\", referring to a broken promise or, more generally, to any failed expectation). The Russian word \\"–æ–±—ä–µ–≥–æ—Ä–∏—Ç—å\\" (meaning to deceive or fool someone, literally, \\"to Yegor around\\", with Yegor ()) also being one of the variants of the name \\"George\\") has the same origin. ƒêurƒëic is one of major Serbian Slava patron-saint days.

It stretches from Walworth County in the south to Kewaunee County in the north. It has also been referred to as the Kettle Range and, in geological texts, as the Kettle Interlobate Moraine. The moraine was created when the Green Bay Lobe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, on the west, collided with the Lake Michigan Lobe of that glacier, on the east, depositing sediment. The western lobe formed Green Bay, Lake Winnebago and the Horicon Marsh. The major part of the Kettle Moraine area is considered interlobate moraine, though other types of moraine features, and other glacial features are common. A small kettle in the area The moraine is dotted with kettles caused by buried glacial ice that calved off the terminus of a receding glacier and got entirely or partly buried in glacial sediment and subsequently melted. This process left depressions ranging from small ponds to large lakes and enclosed valleys. Water-filled kettles range in depth from . The topography of this area is widely varied between the lakes and kettles and the hills of glacial deposits, which can rise up to from the lakes. The largest include Holy Hill, Pulford Peak and Lapham Peak. Elkhart Lake, Geneva Lake, and Little Cedar Lake are among the larger kettles now filled by lakes. Kames are also found in the kettle moraine area, and are mounds of compressed glacial till. Parts of the area have been protected in the Kettle Moraine State Forest.  Recreation  Outdoor recreation opportunities include hiking, biking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, horseback riding, and snowmobiling. Fourteen trailheads are dispersed throughout the Northern Unit of the Kettle Moraine State Forest and 17 in the Southern Unit.

The earlier arms of Gammage found on various rolls of arms omitted the escallops and place the bend fusilly over all. Barbara Sidney, Countess of Leicester (1563 - 24 May 1621) was a Welsh heiress, and the first wife of Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester. Her family connections tied her to prominent contemporary figures such as Sir Walter Raleigh. Origins Barbara was the sole child and heiress John Gamage (d. 1584) of Coity Castle, Glamorgan, and his wife Gwenllian. On the death of her father in September 1584 she was granted by the crown in wardship to Sir Edward Stradling of St Donat's Castle, Glamorgan, until her marriage. Her aunt Margaret (n√©e Gamage), her father's sister, who was the first wife of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham, wrote to Stradling in the late 1570s to thank him and his wife Agnes, who was responsible for teaching Barbara to run a household. Marriage As an heiress, Barbara Gamage was much sought after in marriage, and at least three of her relations were among her suitors: Thomas Jones of Abermarlis, Sir James Whitney, and Herbert Croft. Lord Burghley, who disapproved of the Stradlings being appointed her guardians, favoured Croft, whose grandfather, Sir James, was controller of her household of Queen Elizabeth I of England; Sir James claimed that the Stradlings had given their written permission for such a marriage. Barbara, when she came of age, was forbidden to contract a marriage without the queen's consent. However, Francis Walsingham, another of the queen's close advisors, had married his daughter to Sir Philip Sidney, and favoured a match between Barbara Gamage and Sir Philip's brother Robert Sidney. The story of their romance was later recorded by one of their children, Mary Sidney, Lady Wroth, in The Countesse of Mountgomeries Urania, published in 1621, the year of her mother's death. On 23 September 1584, she married Robert Sidney (created Earl of Leicester in 1616), at St Donat's Castle, the home of her guardian. Although Sidney was the Member of Parliament for Glamorgan, the couple lived chiefly at Baynard's Castle in London and at Penshurst Place in Kent, and the latter house was extended under Barbara's direction, replicating features from her former home at St Donat's. Sidney's letters to his wife, written when he was away from home on official business, have been published, and contain information about household details, the court of Anne of Denmark, and news of major events. Her letters to him have not survived. According to the editor of Ben Jonson's poem \\"To Penshurst\\", the \\"My Lady's Oak\\" and \\"Gamage copse\\" mentioned in the poem are references to Barbara Sidney. According to tradition, she \\"was taken in travail [labour] under an oak in Penshurst Park, which was afterwards called My Lady's Oak \\", and it is also said that she liked to feed the deer under the shade of the copse. The forested area became known as \\"Lady Gamage's Bower\\". She sent peaches to King James, Anne of Denmark, and the Earl of Pembroke, Lord Chamberlain, in September 1616 and 1617.William Shaw & G.

It lived in what is now Alberta and Montana, and contains the single species Hanssuesia sternbergi. Life restoration Hanssuesia is based on a skull dome originally named Troodon sternbergi by Barnum Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer in 1943. The specific name honoured Charles Mortram Sternberg who found the dome in 1928 near Steveville in south Alberta.B. Brown and E.M. Schlaikjer, 1943, \\"A study of the tro√∂dont dinosaurs with the description of a new genus and four new species\\", Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 82(5): 115-150 In 1945, it was transferred to Stegoceras by C.M. Sternberg himself, as a Stegoceras sternbergi.C.M. Sternberg, 1945, \\"Pachycephalosauridae proposed for dome-headed dinosaurs, Stegoceras lambei, n. sp., described\\", Journal of Paleontology 19(5): 534-538 The genus Hanssuesia was first named by Robert M. Sullivan in 2003. It honours paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues. In the publication also the spelling variant \\"Hanssuessia\\" appeared; the same year Sullivan chose for Hanssuesia as the valid name. Its type species is Troodon sternbergi, the combinatio nova is Hanssuesia sternbergi. H. sternbergi is known from the holotype NMC 8817 and six referred specimens (mainly frontoparietals) which were collected from two formations of the Belly River Group of Alberta, Canada, the Dinosaur Park Formation (late Campanian, 76.5‚Äì75 ma) in the Dinosaur Provincial Park, and the Oldman Formation (middle Campanian, 77.5-76.5 ma), as well as from the upper Judith River Formation of Montana, United States (late Campanian, 76‚Äì75 ma). Like other pachycephalosaurs, Hanssuesia had a thick skull roof. However, Hanssuesia is distinguished from other pachycephalosaurs by having a depressed parietal region, a frontoparietal dome that is wide in front as well as in the rear, a broad nasal boss on the frontals, reduced but swollen prefrontal lobes, and a reduced parietosquamosal shelf at the dome rear. A 2020 CSVP abstract found Gravitholus and Hanssuesia to be synonymous with Stegoceras.

He currently lives in Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ, Czech Republic. His first band was War Cry, founded in 1982. In 1983 he started the band Master as a death metal band. Due to internal problems it was put on hold and Speckmann started another band, called Death Strike for which he recorded one demo. which was later released on Nuclear Blast with additional tracks as an album. After obtaining a deal for Abomination on Nuclear Blast, Master was approached at the same time and Master re-surfaced to record a full-length CD as well. The band subsequently broke up in the original form two days after the recording. They were replaced shortly afterward by Aaron Nickeas on drums, and Jim Martinelli on guitars. This period was followed by the Fleische tour with Master as headliner, Abomination as support, and Pungent Stench in the middle of both acts. Nickeas and Speckmann played in both groups for 26 dates on this tour. Speckmann recorded the self-titled debut album, which was really the Master songs re- recorded with Martinelli and Nickeas. Nuclear Blast turned this down, and decided to remix the original recording with Schmidt and Mittelbrun. The recording with Martinelli and Nickeas was then released as the Speckmann Project. Speckmann also played, and wrote all the songs for a band called, Abomination and recorded two albums with them. Currently he is playing bass guitar in the Czech death metal band Krabathor, as well as keeping Master alive. He also played in the Master-Krabathor side-project Martyr and released one album with them. The band Krabathor split up in 2004 and Master was reformed with guitarist Alex Nejezchleba and drummer Zdenek Pradlovsky.

This experience led her to embrace Marxism, the politics of Fidel Castro and ultimately radical feminism.Echols, Alice, Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America: 1967‚Äì1975 (Minneapolis, Minn.: Univ. of Minn.

Along with Betsy Warrior, Dana Densmore, Jayne West and others they published ground-breaking feminist analyses. Rockefeller and Jayne West joined other members of Cell 16 in promoting self- defense for women and became skilled in karate. They set up a Tae Kwon Do studio in Boston and taught hundreds of women who, in turn, taught other women, becoming pioneers in self-defense for women. This effort was initiated in response to the frequent, if unremarked, street harassment and sexual assaults women were subjected to during this era. After reading the literature of Cell 16, especially the initial \\"Journals of Female Liberation\\", Abby Rockefeller decided to join them. One of the articles she contributed to the Journals of Female Liberation was Sex: The Basis of Sexism, which posited male desire to access and control female sexuality for their own ends as a driving force in sexism. After being infiltrated by Trotskyites and F.B.I. agents, Cell 16 disassociated from its splinter group Female Liberation, which was providing a front for Trotskyist recruiting of aspiring feminists.Humanities & Social Sciences Online.

To date, three species have been described: the type species, S. goodwini, from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; S. buchholtzae, from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and S. edmontonense, from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada. History of discovery Restoration of a pair The etymology of Sphaerotholus is a combination of the Greek sphaira, meaning \\"ball\\", and tholos, meaning \\"dome\\", and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull. The survival of Sphaerotholus from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8 million years) and a widespread distribution. Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: \\"Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.\\" Sphaerotholus is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur. Species Sphaerotholus goodwini The holotype of the type species (NMMNH P-27403, New Mexico Museum of Natural History) consists of an incomplete skull lacking the facial and palatal elements. The species is diagnosed as follows: \\"Sphaerotholus which in caudal view possesses a parietosquamosal bar that reduces in depth laterally to a lesser extent than in S. buchholtzae and the parietal is reduced to a thin slip between the squamosals.\\" The species name honors paleontologist Mark Goodwin for his work with pachycephalosaurian dinosaurs. Sphaerotholus buchholtzae The holotype of S. buchholtzae (TMP 87.113.3) consists of an incomplete skull. The species was diagnosed as having a parietal that is widely exposed between the squamosals and wide enough to bear parietosquamosal nodes, a shallower caudal margin of the parietosquamosal shelf, the lateral corner node is reduced in size and located above the ventral margin of the parietosquamosal bar, and the nodes in the lateral margin of the parietosquamosal shelf reduced on the squamosal and coalescing into a ridge on the postorbital. The specific name honors Emily A. Buchholtz for her extensive work with pachycephalosaurians. Sullivan (2003) considered S. buchholtzae a junior synonym of Prenocephale edmontonensis (or Sphaerotholus edmontonense). However, Mallon et al. (2015), in their description of a new S. buchholtzae specimen from the Frenchman Formation of Saskatchewan, Canada, noted that S. edmontonense was distinct from buchholtzae based on comparative morphology and morphometrics. Sphaerotholus edmontonense A Troodon edmontonensis was described by Brown and Schlaikjer in 1943 on the basis of three domes from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta. Williamson and Carr considered the species to be invalid, but in 2010 Nicholas Longrich e.a. named a Sphaerotholus edmontonense that could be distinguished from S. goodwini by the paired hornlets on the back of the dome, and from S. buchholtzae by the elongate parietals.

Life Sidney was born at Castle Barnard, County Durham, the son of Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester, and his first wife, Barbara Gamage.W R Williams Parliamentary History of the Principality of Wales He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1610 he was created Knight of the Bath when Prince Henry was created Prince of Wales. He was elected Member of Parliament for Wilton in 1614. Sidney served in the army in the Netherlands during his father's governorship of Flushing, and was given command of an English regiment in the Dutch service in 1616. In 1618 he became a member of Gray's Inn. He was elected one of the two knights of the shire for Kent in 1621. In 1624 he was elected as the member for Monmouthshire and was re-elected for that county in 1625. In 1626, he succeeded his father as Earl of Leicester In 1631, he began the construction of Leicester House, a huge mansion on the site of what is now Leicester Square in London. He was employed on diplomatic business in Denmark in 1632 and undertook further diplomatic work in France from 1636 to 1641. Lord Leicester was then appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in place of The Earl of Strafford. When the governorship of Dublin became vacant, Leicester appointed George Monck. Charles I, however, overruled the appointment in favour of Lord Lambart. In 1643 he resigned without having set foot in Ireland. Lord Leicester died at Penshurst at the age of nearly 81. He was \\"esteemed of great learning, observation and veracity\\". Family In 1615, Sidney married Lady Dorothy Percy, the daughter of Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland.

It was a pachycephalosaur, and like other pachycephalosaurids the skull roof formed a thick dome made of dense bone, which may have been used in head-butting contests over mates or territory. It lived in what is now Alberta, Canada, and was described in 1979 by W. P. Wall and Peter Galton. The type species is Gravitholus albertae. There is some debate amongst paleontologists as to whether the animal represents a distinct genus, or if it may be synonymous with Stegoceras. Recent publications indicate it may be a valid genus. Gravitholus is one of several pachycephalosaurids known from Dinosaur Park, including Stegoceras validum, Hanssuesia sternbergi, and Foraminacephale brevis.

This is done either by the action of heat, or at lower temperatures using precipitation reactions from high-purity chemical solutions. The term includes the purification of raw materials, the study and production of the chemical compounds concerned, their formation into components and the study of their structure, composition and properties. Ceramic materials may have a crystalline or partly crystalline structure, with long-range order on atomic scale. Glass ceramics may have an amorphous or glassy structure, with limited or short-range atomic order. They are either formed from a molten mass that solidifies on cooling, formed and matured by the action of heat, or chemically synthesized at low temperatures using, for example, hydrothermal or sol-gel synthesis. The special character of ceramic materials gives rise to many applications in materials engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. As ceramics are heat resistant, they can be used for many tasks for which materials like metal and polymers are unsuitable. Ceramic materials are used in a wide range of industries, including mining, aerospace, medicine, refinery, food and chemical industries, packaging science, electronics, industrial and transmission electricity, and guided lightwave transmission.Kingery, W.D., Bowen, H.K., and Uhlmann, D.R., Introduction to Ceramics, p. 690 (Wiley-Interscience, 2nd Edition, 2006)  History  The word \\"ceramic\\" is derived from the Greek word () meaning pottery. It is related to the older Indo-European language root \\"to burn\\". \\"Ceramic\\" may be used as a noun in the singular to refer to a ceramic material or the product of ceramic manufacture, or as an adjective. Ceramics is the making of things out of ceramic materials. Ceramic engineering, like many sciences, evolved from a different discipline by today's standards. Materials science engineering is grouped with ceramics engineering to this day. Leo Morandi's tile glazing line (circa 1945) Abraham Darby first used coke in 1709 in Shropshire, England, to improve the yield of a smelting process. Coke is now widely used to produce carbide ceramics. Potter Josiah Wedgwood opened the first modern ceramics factory in Stoke-on-Trent, England, in 1759. Austrian chemist Carl Josef Bayer, working for the textile industry in Russia, developed a process to separate alumina from bauxite ore in 1888. The Bayer process is still used to purify alumina for the ceramic and aluminium industries. Brothers Pierre and Jacques Curie discovered piezoelectricity in Rochelle salt circa 1880. Piezoelectricity is one of the key properties of electroceramics. E.G. Acheson heated a mixture of coke and clay in 1893, and invented carborundum, or synthetic silicon carbide. Henri Moissan also synthesized SiC and tungsten carbide in his electric arc furnace in Paris about the same time as Acheson. Karl Schr√∂ter used liquid-phase sintering to bond or \\"cement\\" Moissan's tungsten carbide particles with cobalt in 1923 in Germany. Cemented (metal-bonded) carbide edges greatly increase the durability of hardened steel cutting tools. W.H. Nernst developed cubic-stabilized zirconia in the 1920s in Berlin. This material is used as an oxygen sensor in exhaust systems. The main limitation on the use of ceramics in engineering is brittleness.  Military  Soldiers pictured during the 2003 Iraq War seen through IR transparent Night Vision Goggles The military requirements of World War II encouraged developments, which created a need for high-performance materials and helped speed the development of ceramic science and engineering. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, new types of ceramics were developed in response to advances in atomic energy, electronics, communications, and space travel. The discovery of ceramic superconductors in 1986 has spurred intense research to develop superconducting ceramic parts for electronic devices, electric motors, and transportation equipment. There is an increasing need in the military sector for high-strength, robust materials which have the capability to transmit light around the visible (0.4‚Äì0.7 micrometers) and mid- infrared (1‚Äì5 micrometers) regions of the spectrum. These materials are needed for applications requiring transparent armour. Transparent armour is a material or system of materials designed to be optically transparent, yet protect from fragmentation or ballistic impacts. The primary requirement for a transparent armour system is to not only defeat the designated threat but also provide a multi-hit capability with minimized distortion of surrounding areas. Transparent armour windows must also be compatible with night vision equipment. New materials that are thinner, lightweight, and offer better ballistic performance are being sought. Such solid-state components have found widespread use for various applications in the electro-optical field including: optical fibres for guided lightwave transmission, optical switches, laser amplifiers and lenses, hosts for solid-state lasers and optical window materials for gas lasers, and infrared (IR) heat seeking devices for missile guidance systems and IR night vision.Harris, D.C., \\"Materials for Infrared Windows and Domes: Properties and Performance\\", SPIE PRESS Monograph, Vol. PM70 (Int. Society of Optical Engineers, Bellingham WA, 2009)  Modern industry  Now a multibillion-dollar a year industry, ceramic engineering and research has established itself as an important field of science. Applications continue to expand as researchers develop new kinds of ceramics to serve different purposes.Richerson, D.W., Modern Ceramic Engineering, 2nd Ed., (Marcel Dekker Inc., 1992) . *Zirconium dioxide ceramics are used in the manufacture of knives. The blade of the ceramic knife will stay sharp for much longer than that of a steel knife, although it is more brittle and can be snapped by dropping it on a hard surface. *Ceramics such as alumina, boron carbide and silicon carbide have been used in bulletproof vests to repel small arms rifle fire. Such plates are known commonly as trauma plates. Similar material is used to protect cockpits of some military aircraft, because of the low weight of the material. *Silicon nitride parts are used in ceramic ball bearings. Their higher hardness means that they are much less susceptible to wear and can offer more than triple lifetimes. They also deform less under load meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from friction during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings; problems which are reduced by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would rust. The major drawback to using ceramics is a significantly higher cost. In many cases their electrically insulating properties may also be valuable in bearings. *In the early 1980s, Toyota researched production of an adiabatic ceramic engine which can run at a temperature of over 6000 ¬∞F (3300 ¬∞C). Ceramic engines do not require a cooling system and hence allow a major weight reduction and therefore greater fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency of the engine is also higher at high temperature, as shown by Carnot's theorem. In a conventional metallic engine, much of the energy released from the fuel must be dissipated as waste heat in order to prevent a meltdown of the metallic parts. Despite all of these desirable properties, such engines are not in production because the manufacturing of ceramic parts in the requisite precision and durability is difficult. Imperfection in the ceramic leads to cracks, which can lead to potentially dangerous equipment failure. Such engines are possible in laboratory settings, but mass-production is not feasible with current technology. *Work is being done in developing ceramic parts for gas turbine engines. Currently, even blades made of advanced metal alloys used in the engines' hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating temperatures. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel. Collagen fibers of woven bone Scanning electron microscopy image of bone *Recently, there have been advances in ceramics which include bio-ceramics, such as dental implants and synthetic bones. Hydroxyapatite, the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. Orthopaedic implants made from these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions. Because of this, they are of great interest for gene delivery and tissue engineering scaffolds. Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength and are used to coat metal orthopaedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopaedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong, fully dense nano crystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials for orthopaedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopaedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring, bone mineral. Ultimately these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein collagens, synthetic bones. *Durable actinide-containing ceramic materials have many applications such as in nuclear fuels for burning excess Pu and in chemically-inert sources of alpha irradiation for power supply of unmanned space vehicles or to produce electricity for microelectronic devices. Both use and disposal of radioactive actinides require their immobilisation in a durable host material. Nuclear waste long-lived radionuclides such as actinides are immobilised using chemically-durable crystalline materials based on polycrystalline ceramics and large single crystals.B.E. Burakov, M.I Ojovan, W.E. Lee. Crystalline Materials for Actinide Immobilisation, Imperial College Press, London, 198 pp. (2010). http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p652.  Glass-ceramics  A high strength glass-ceramic cook-top with negligible thermal expansion. Glass-ceramic materials share many properties with both glasses and ceramics. Glass-ceramics have an amorphous phase and one or more crystalline phases and are produced by a so-called \\"controlled crystallization\\", which is typically avoided in glass manufacturing. Glass-ceramics often contain a crystalline phase which constitutes anywhere from 30% [m/m] to 90% [m/m] of its composition by volume, yielding an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties. In the processing of glass-ceramics, molten glass is cooled down gradually before reheating and annealing. In this heat treatment the glass partly crystallizes. In many cases, so-called 'nucleation agents' are added in order to regulate and control the crystallization process. Because there is usually no pressing and sintering, glass-ceramics do not contain the volume fraction of porosity typically present in sintered ceramics. The term mainly refers to a mix of lithium and aluminosilicates which yields an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties. The most commercially important of these have the distinction of being impervious to thermal shock. Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking. The negative thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive TEC of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net TEC near zero. This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000 ¬∞C. Processing steps The traditional ceramic process generally follows this sequence: Milling ‚Üí Batching ‚Üí Mixing ‚Üí Forming ‚Üí Drying ‚Üí Firing ‚Üí Assembly. Ball mill *Milling is the process by which materials are reduced from a large size to a smaller size. Milling may involve breaking up cemented material (in which case individual particles retain their shape) or pulverization (which involves grinding the particles themselves to a smaller size). Milling is generally done by mechanical means, including attrition (which is particle-to-particle collision that results in agglomerate break up or particle shearing), compression (which applies a forces that results in fracturing), and impact (which employs a milling medium or the particles themselves to cause fracturing). Attrition milling equipment includes the wet scrubber (also called the planetary mill or wet attrition mill), which has paddles in water creating vortexes in which the material collides and break up. Compression mills include the jaw crusher, roller crusher and cone crusher. Impact mills include the ball mill, which has media that tumble and fracture the material. Shaft impactors cause particle-to particle attrition and compression. *Batching is the process of weighing the oxides according to recipes, and preparing them for mixing and drying. *Mixing occurs after batching and is performed with various machines, such as dry mixing ribbon mixers (a type of cement mixer), Mueller mixers, and pug mills. Wet mixing generally involves the same equipment. *Forming is making the mixed material into shapes, ranging from toilet bowls to spark plug insulators. Forming can involve: (1) Extrusion, such as extruding \\"slugs\\" to make bricks, (2) Pressing to make shaped parts, (3) Slip casting, as in making toilet bowls, wash basins and ornamentals like ceramic statues. Forming produces a \\"green\\" part, ready for drying. Green parts are soft, pliable, and over time will lose shape. Handling the green product will change its shape. For example, a green brick can be \\"squeezed\\", and after squeezing it will stay that way. *Drying is removing the water or binder from the formed material. Spray drying is widely used to prepare powder for pressing operations. Other dryers are tunnel dryers and periodic dryers. Controlled heat is applied in this two-stage process. First, heat removes water. This step needs careful control, as rapid heating causes cracks and surface defects. The dried part is smaller than the green part, and is brittle, necessitating careful handling, since a small impact will cause crumbling and breaking. *Sintering is where the dried parts pass through a controlled heating process, and the oxides are chemically changed to cause bonding and densification. The fired part will be smaller than the dried part. Forming methods Ceramic forming techniques include throwing, slipcasting, tape casting, freeze-casting, injection moulding, dry pressing, isostatic pressing, hot isostatic pressing (HIP), 3D printing and others. Methods for forming ceramic powders into complex shapes are desirable in many areas of technology. Such methods are required for producing advanced, high- temperature structural parts such as heat engine components and turbines. Materials other than ceramics which are used in these processes may include: wood, metal, water, plaster and epoxy‚Äîmost of which will be eliminated upon firing. These forming techniques are well known for providing tools and other components with dimensional stability, surface quality, high (near theoretical) density and microstructural uniformity. The increasing use and diversity of speciality forms of ceramics adds to the diversity of process technologies to be used. Thus, reinforcing fibres and filaments are mainly made by polymer, sol-gel, or CVD processes, but melt processing also has applicability. The most widely used speciality form is layered structures, with tape casting for electronic substrates and packages being pre-eminent. Photo-lithography is of increasing interest for precise patterning of conductors and other components for such packaging. Tape casting or forming processes are also of increasing interest for other applications, ranging from open structures such as fuel cells to ceramic composites. The other major layer structure is coating, where melt spraying is very important, but chemical and physical vapour deposition and chemical (e.g., sol-gel and polymer pyrolysis) methods are all seeing increased use. Besides open structures from formed tape, extruded structures, such as honeycomb catalyst supports, and highly porous structures, including various foams, for example, reticulated foam, are of increasing use. Densification of consolidated powder bodies continues to be achieved predominantly by (pressureless) sintering. However, the use of pressure sintering by hot pressing is increasing, especially for non-oxides and parts of simple shapes where higher quality (mainly microstructural homogeneity) is needed, and larger size or multiple parts per pressing can be an advantage.  The sintering process  The principles of sintering-based methods are simple (\\"sinter\\" has roots in the English \\"cinder\\"). The firing is done at a temperature below the melting point of the ceramic. Once a roughly-held-together object called a \\"green body\\" is made, it is baked in a kiln, where atomic and molecular diffusion processes give rise to significant changes in the primary microstructural features. This includes the gradual elimination of porosity, which is typically accompanied by a net shrinkage and overall densification of the component. Thus, the pores in the object may close up, resulting in a denser product of significantly greater strength and fracture toughness. Another major change in the body during the firing or sintering process will be the establishment of the polycrystalline nature of the solid. This change will introduce some form of grain size distribution, which will have a significant impact on the ultimate physical properties of the material. The grain sizes will either be associated with the initial particle size, or possibly the sizes of aggregates or particle clusters which arise during the initial stages of processing. The ultimate microstructure (and thus the physical properties) of the final product will be limited by and subject to the form of the structural template or precursor which is created in the initial stages of chemical synthesis and physical forming. Hence the importance of chemical powder and polymer processing as it pertains to the synthesis of industrial ceramics, glasses and glass-ceramics. There are numerous possible refinements of the sintering process. Some of the most common involve pressing the green body to give the densification a head start and reduce the sintering time needed. Sometimes organic binders such as polyvinyl alcohol are added to hold the green body together; these burn out during the firing (at 200‚Äì350 ¬∞C). Sometimes organic lubricants are added during pressing to increase densification. It is common to combine these, and add binders and lubricants to a powder, then press. (The formulation of these organic chemical additives is an art in itself. This is particularly important in the manufacture of high performance ceramics such as those used by the billions for electronics, in capacitors, inductors, sensors, etc.) A slurry can be used in place of a powder, and then cast into a desired shape, dried and then sintered. Indeed, traditional pottery is done with this type of method, using a plastic mixture worked with the hands. If a mixture of different materials is used together in a ceramic, the sintering temperature is sometimes above the melting point of one minor component ‚Äì a liquid phase sintering. This results in shorter sintering times compared to solid state sintering.Rahaman, M.N., Ceramic Processing and Sintering, 2nd Ed. (Marcel Dekker Inc., 2003) Strength of ceramics A material's strength is dependent on its microstructure. The engineering processes to which a material is subjected can alter its microstructure. The variety of strengthening mechanisms that alter the strength of a material include the mechanism of grain boundary strengthening. Thus, although yield strength is maximized with decreasing grain size, ultimately, very small grain sizes make the material brittle. Considered in tandem with the fact that the yield strength is the parameter that predicts plastic deformation in the material, one can make informed decisions on how to increase the strength of a material depending on its microstructural properties and the desired end effect. The relation between yield stress and grain size is described mathematically by the Hall- Petch equation which is :\\\\sigma_y = \\\\sigma_0 + {k_y \\\\over \\\\sqrt {d}} where ky is the strengthening coefficient (a constant unique to each material), œÉo is a materials constant for the starting stress for dislocation movement (or the resistance of the lattice to dislocation motion), d is the grain diameter, and œÉy is the yield stress. Theoretically, a material could be made infinitely strong if the grains are made infinitely small. This is, unfortunately, impossible because the lower limit of grain size is a single unit cell of the material. Even then, if the grains of a material are the size of a single unit cell, then the material is in fact amorphous, not crystalline, since there is no long range order, and dislocations can not be defined in an amorphous material. It has been observed experimentally that the microstructure with the highest yield strength is a grain size of about 10 nanometres, because grains smaller than this undergo another yielding mechanism, grain boundary sliding. Producing engineering materials with this ideal grain size is difficult because of the limitations of initial particle sizes inherent to nanomaterials and nanotechnology. Theory of chemical processing Microstructural uniformity In the processing of fine ceramics, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing density variations in the powder compact. Uncontrolled agglomeration of powders due to attractive van der Waals forces can also give rise to in microstructural inhomogeneities. Differential stresses that develop as a result of non-uniform drying shrinkage are directly related to the rate at which the solvent can be removed, and thus highly dependent upon the distribution of porosity. Such stresses have been associated with a plastic- to-brittle transition in consolidated bodies, and can yield to crack propagation in the unfired body if not relieved. In addition, any fluctuations in packing density in the compact as it is prepared for the kiln are often amplified during the sintering process, yielding inhomogeneous densification. Some pores and other structural defects associated with density variations have been shown to play a detrimental role in the sintering process by growing and thus limiting end-point densities. Differential stresses arising from inhomogeneous densification have also been shown to result in the propagation of internal cracks, thus becoming the strength-controlling flaws. It would therefore appear desirable to process a material in such a way that it is physically uniform with regard to the distribution of components and porosity, rather than using particle size distributions which will maximize the green density. The containment of a uniformly dispersed assembly of strongly interacting particles in suspension requires total control over particle- particle interactions. Monodisperse colloids provide this potential. Monodisperse powders of colloidal silica, for example, may therefore be stabilized sufficiently to ensure a high degree of order in the colloidal crystal or polycrystalline colloidal solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established. Such defective polycrystalline colloidal structures would appear to be the basic elements of submicrometer colloidal materials science, and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in inorganic systems such as polycrystalline ceramics.  Self-assembly  An example of a supramolecular assembly. Self- assembly is the most common term in use in the modern scientific community to describe the spontaneous aggregation of particles (atoms, molecules, colloids, micelles, etc.) without the influence of any external forces. Large groups of such particles are known to assemble themselves into thermodynamically stable, structurally well-defined arrays, quite reminiscent of one of the 7 crystal systems found in metallurgy and mineralogy (e.g. face-centred cubic, body- centred cubic, etc.). The fundamental difference in equilibrium structure is in the spatial scale of the unit cell (or lattice parameter) in each particular case. Thus, self-assembly is emerging as a new strategy in chemical synthesis and nanotechnology. Molecular self-assembly has been observed in various biological systems and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Molecular crystals, liquid crystals, colloids, micelles, emulsions, phase-separated polymers, thin films and self-assembled monolayers all represent examples of the types of highly ordered structures which are obtained using these techniques. The distinguishing feature of these methods is self-organization in the absence of any external forces. In addition, the principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer composites, elastomers, and cellular materials are being re-evaluated, with an emphasis on bioinspired materials and structures. Traditional approaches focus on design methods of biological materials using conventional synthetic materials. This includes an emerging class of mechanically superior biomaterials based on microstructural features and designs found in nature. The new horizons have been identified in the synthesis of bioinspired materials through processes that are characteristic of biological systems in nature. This includes the nanoscale self-assembly of the components and the development of hierarchical structures. Ceramic composites The Porsche Carrera GT's carbon-ceramic (silicon carbide) composite disc brake Substantial interest has arisen in recent years in fabricating ceramic composites. While there is considerable interest in composites with one or more non-ceramic constituents, the greatest attention is on composites in which all constituents are ceramic. These typically comprise two ceramic constituents: a continuous matrix, and a dispersed phase of ceramic particles, whiskers, or short (chopped) or continuous ceramic fibres. The challenge, as in wet chemical processing, is to obtain a uniform or homogeneous distribution of the dispersed particle or fibre phase.Hull, D. and Clyne, T.W. (1996) An Introduction to Composite Materials. Cambridge Solid State Science Series, Cambridge University Press Barbero, E.J. (2010) Introduction to Composite Materials Design, 2nd Edn., CRC Press. Consider first the processing of particulate composites. The particulate phase of greatest interest is tetragonal zirconia because of the toughening that can be achieved from the phase transformation from the metastable tetragonal to the monoclinic crystalline phase, aka transformation toughening. There is also substantial interest in dispersion of hard, non-oxide phases such as SiC, TiB, TiC, boron, carbon and especially oxide matrices like alumina and mullite. There is also interest too incorporating other ceramic particulates, especially those of highly anisotropic thermal expansion. Examples include Al2O3, TiO2, graphite, and boron nitride. Silicon carbide single crystal In processing particulate composites, the issue is not only homogeneity of the size and spatial distribution of the dispersed and matrix phases, but also control of the matrix grain size. However, there is some built-in self-control due to inhibition of matrix grain growth by the dispersed phase. Particulate composites, though generally offer increased resistance to damage, failure, or both, are still quite sensitive to inhomogeneities of composition as well as other processing defects such as pores. Thus they need good processing to be effective. Particulate composites have been made on a commercial basis by simply mixing powders of the two constituents. Although this approach is inherently limited in the homogeneity that can be achieved, it is the most readily adaptable for existing ceramic production technology. However, other approaches are of interest. Tungsten carbide milling bits From the technological standpoint, a particularly desirable approach to fabricating particulate composites is to coat the matrix or its precursor onto fine particles of the dispersed phase with good control of the starting dispersed particle size and the resultant matrix coating thickness. One should in principle be able to achieve the ultimate in homogeneity of distribution and thereby optimize composite performance. This can also have other ramifications, such as allowing more useful composite performance to be achieved in a body having porosity, which might be desired for other factors, such as limiting thermal conductivity. There are also some opportunities to utilize melt processing for fabrication of ceramic, particulate, whisker and short-fibre, and continuous-fibre composites. Clearly, both particulate and whisker composites are conceivable by solid-state precipitation after solidification of the melt. This can also be obtained in some cases by sintering, as for precipitation-toughened, partially stabilized zirconia. Similarly, it is known that one can directionally solidify ceramic eutectic mixtures and hence obtain uniaxially aligned fibre composites. Such composite processing has typically been limited to very simple shapes and thus suffers from serious economic problems due to high machining costs. Clearly, there are possibilities of using melt casting for many of these approaches. Potentially even more desirable is using melt-derived particles. In this method, quenching is done in a solid solution or in a fine eutectic structure, in which the particles are then processed by more typical ceramic powder processing methods into a useful body. There have also been preliminary attempts to use melt spraying as a means of forming composites by introducing the dispersed particulate, whisker, or fibre phase in conjunction with the melt spraying process. Other methods besides melt infiltration to manufacture ceramic composites with long fibre reinforcement are chemical vapour infiltration and the infiltration of fibre preforms with organic precursor, which after pyrolysis yield an amorphous ceramic matrix, initially with a low density. With repeated cycles of infiltration and pyrolysis one of those types of ceramic matrix composites is produced. Chemical vapour infiltration is used to manufacture carbon/carbon and silicon carbide reinforced with carbon or silicon carbide fibres. Besides many process improvements, the first of two major needs for fibre composites is lower fibre costs. The second major need is fibre compositions or coatings, or composite processing, to reduce degradation that results from high-temperature composite exposure under oxidizing conditions. Applications Silicon nitride thruster. Left: Mounted in test stand. Right: Being tested with H2/O2 propellants The products of technical ceramics include tiles used in the Space Shuttle program, gas burner nozzles, ballistic protection, nuclear fuel uranium oxide pellets, bio-medical implants, jet engine turbine blades, and missile nose cones. Its products are often made from materials other than clay, chosen for their particular physical properties. These may be classified as follows: *Oxides: silica, alumina, zirconia *Non-oxides: carbides, borides, nitrides, silicides *Composites: particulate or whisker reinforced matrices, combinations of oxides and non-oxides (e.g. polymers). Ceramics can be used in many technological industries. One application is the ceramic tiles on NASA's Space Shuttle, used to protect it and the future supersonic space planes from the searing heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. They are also used widely in electronics and optics. In addition to the applications listed here, ceramics are also used as a coating in various engineering cases. An example would be a ceramic bearing coating over a titanium frame used for an aircraft. Recently the field has come to include the studies of single crystals or glass fibres, in addition to traditional polycrystalline materials, and the applications of these have been overlapping and changing rapidly.  Aerospace  *Engines: shielding a hot running aircraft engine from damaging other components. *Airframes: used as a high-stress, high-temp and lightweight bearing and structural component. *Missile nose-cones: shielding the missile internals from heat. *Space Shuttle tiles *Space-debris ballistic shields: ceramic fiber woven shields offer better protection to hypervelocity (~7 km/s) particles than aluminium shields of equal weight.Ceramic Fabric Offers Space Age Protection, 1994 Hypervelocity Impact Symposium *Rocket nozzles: focusing high-temperature exhaust gases from the rocket booster. *Unmanned Air Vehicles: ceramic engine utilization in aeronautical applications (such as Unmanned Air Vehicles) may result in enhanced performance characteristics and less operational costs.

Silicification is quite common in the biological world and occurs in bacteria, single-celled organisms, plants, and animals (invertebrates and vertebrates). Crystalline minerals formed in such environment often show exceptional physical properties (e.g. strength, hardness, fracture toughness) and tend to form hierarchical structures that exhibit microstructural order over a range of length or spatial scales. The minerals are crystallized from an environment that is undersaturated with respect to silicon, and under conditions of neutral pH and low temperature (0‚Äì40 ¬∞C). Formation of the mineral may occur either within or outside of the cell wall of an organism, and specific biochemical reactions for mineral deposition exist that include lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Most natural (or biological) materials are complex composites whose mechanical properties are often outstanding, considering the weak constituents from which they are assembled. These complex structures, which have risen from hundreds of million years of evolution, are inspiring the design of novel materials with exceptional physical properties for high performance in adverse conditions. Their defining characteristics such as hierarchy, multifunctionality, and the capacity for self-healing, are currently being investigated. The basic building blocks begin with the 20 amino acids and proceed to polypeptides, polysaccharides, and polypeptides‚Äìsaccharides. These, in turn, compose the basic proteins, which are the primary constituents of the ‚Äòsoft tissues‚Äô common to most biominerals. With well over 1000 proteins possible, current research emphasizes the use of collagen, chitin, keratin, and elastin. The ‚Äòhard‚Äô phases are often strengthened by crystalline minerals, which nucleate and grow in a biomediated environment that determines the size, shape and distribution of individual crystals. The most important mineral phases have been identified as hydroxyapatite, silica, and aragonite. Using the classification of Wegst and Ashby, the principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer composites, elastomers, and cellular materials have been presented. Selected systems in each class are being investigated with emphasis on the relationship between their microstructure over a range of length scales and their mechanical response. Thus, the crystallization of inorganic materials in nature generally occurs at ambient temperature and pressure. Yet the vital organisms through which these minerals form are capable of consistently producing extremely precise and complex structures. Understanding the processes in which living organisms control the growth of crystalline minerals such as silica could lead to significant advances in the field of materials science, and open the door to novel synthesis techniques for nanoscale composite materials, or nanocomposites. The iridescent nacre inside a Nautilus shell. High-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations were performed of the microstructure of the mother-of-pearl (or nacre) portion of the abalone shell. Those shells exhibit the highest mechanical strength and fracture toughness of any non-metallic substance known. The nacre from the shell of the abalone has become one of the more intensively studied biological structures in materials science. Clearly visible in these images are the neatly stacked (or ordered) mineral tiles separated by thin organic sheets along with a macrostructure of larger periodic growth bands which collectively form what scientists are currently referring to as a hierarchical composite structure. (The term hierarchy simply implies that there are a range of structural features which exist over a wide range of length scales). Future developments reside in the synthesis of bio-inspired materials through processing methods and strategies that are characteristic of biological systems. These involve nanoscale self- assembly of the components and the development of hierarchical structures.

The Province of Cuyo was transferred to the Audiencia of Buenos Aires, when the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata was created in the late eighteenth century. Independence The Audiencia continued to function after the establishment of the First Government Junta of the Kingdom of Chile on September 18, 1810, until the Figueroa mutiny of April 1, 1811. In fact, its Regent, Fernando M√°rquez de la Plata, was elected as one of the junta's members. The Figueroa uprising provided a reason to dissolve the Audiencia, seen by many as a bastion of royalism, and it was replaced by a Tribunal de Apelaciones or Appeals Court. With the temporary return of royalists to power after the Battle of Rancagua, the body was reconstituted by the new Governor- Captain General, Mariano Osorio.

It peaked at No. 36 on the UK Albums Chart. Background and content Part of the second British blues boom of the late 1960s, during that time Fleetwood Mac enjoyed six British hit singles, collated here along with one non-charting single, two B-sides, and three album tracks. The band's UK single \\"Black Magic Woman\\" received greater exposure in the US when it was covered by the American group Santana, who placed their version in the Billboard Top 40. A very similar release with the same title and same cover was released by Sony BMG in 1989, but consisted of the tracks from The Pious Bird of Good Omen plus \\"Shake Your Moneymaker\\" and \\"Love That Burns\\". Another identically-titled but entirely different 1988 Greatest Hits album concentrates exclusively on post-1975 material and has no tracks in common with either this release or the 1989 one.

History In the mid-1990s, Longford Town moved their home ground from Abbeycartron to the townland of Mullologher just off the N5 road between Longford and Tarmonbarry. It is one of the few League of Ireland grounds which is owned by the club itself. The stadium underwent a huge redevelopment at the end of 2000‚Äì01 season. Previous to this, while containing a good pitch and floodlights, the ground had poor facilities along with two terraced (one uncovered) stands and a single-seater stand. The club's promotion to the Premier Division in 2000 was seen as a catalyst in the redevelopment of the ground to its present-day form. Through the receipt of government and FAI grant aid, it was fully redeveloped into an all-seater stadium by July 2001. The ground's capacity is 5,097. The ground became known as Flancare Park, after the club's then sponsor Flancare, in early 2001 until the arrangement finished at the end of 2013. During this time the ground held numerous international underage matches, three UEFA Cup ties and staged the 2004 League Cup final (which Longford won). It was affectionately referred to by League of Ireland fans as the Flan Siro; a play on the name of Flancare Park and on the name of the world-famous San Siro stadium in Milan, Italy. In 2014, the ground's name changed to the City Calling Stadium. This name change was related to the club's then newly acquired main sponsor City Calling Group, a recruitment agency. In 2018, City Calling Stadium was honoured with the Football Association of Ireland Pitch of the Year award. The stadium was selected as a venue for the 2019 UEFA European Under-17 Championship as part of Ireland's hosting of the tournament. Four group stage matches were held at the ground including England v France on 3rd May 2019. In November 2019, the ground was re-named Bishopsgate after the club's new main sponsor. Bishopsgate is a large contractor payroll solution for national and international companies who provide operatives into the UK market.

He served from 1955 until 1965. Though born in Dallas, Alger was reared in Webster Groves, Missouri, a small suburb of St. Louis. Background Alger was the son of David Bruce Alger, a bank representative, and the former Clare Freeman, an aspiring poet and writer.Russell A. Alger papers, William L. Clements Library, The University of Michigan. Alger attended Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey on a scholarship. There he studied philosophy, art, and music and was a center for the football team. Alger graduated from Princeton with an A.B. in philosophy in 1940 after completing a 73-page long senior thesis titled \\"Chinese Painting.\\" he went to work for the RCA Corporation as a field representative. With the coming of World War II, Alger joined the United States Army, assigned to Squadron 5 at the Army Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas.Russell A. Alger papers, William L. Clements Library, The University of Michigan. He flew bombers and attained the rank of captain, claiming to be among the first American troops in Japan after the conclusion of the war in August 1945. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross. On returning to civilian life, RCA refused to rehire him on the grounds that he had been out of television production for too long. In April 2013, Alger self-published a book on his experience in World War II; The Crew Book - Miss America '62. The B-29 that Alger piloted was named \\"Miss America '62\\" after his daughter who would turn 18 in 1962. The book details the crew's experience through training, combat, and eventually the surrender of Japan. In 1945, Alger moved to Dallas and formed his own real estate and land development company. He was chosen as the first president of the White Rock Chamber of Commerce.  Development Of Alger Park  In 1950, Alger announced the development of a 180-lot subdivision in Far East Dallas off Peavy Road which was to bear his name, and is known as Alger Park. Alger continued to support the development after being elected to Congress, even speaking at ceremonies for the neighborhood. Congressional service (1955-1965) In 1954, Alger became the Republican candidate for U.S. House of Representatives for Texas' 5th congressional district. Considering his state's Democratic tradition, it was unexpected that Alger would win. He received 27,982 ballots (52.9 percent) to Democrat Wallace H. Savage's 24,904 (47.1 percent). He was the only Republican in the Texas delegation for eight years until 1963, when Ed Foreman of Odessa, later of Dallas, joined Alger for the final two years of his tenure. Alger served during the heyday of the Lyndon B. Johnson and Sam Rayburn era. As a Republican, and a strongly conservative Republican at that, he was the odd man out in the Texas delegation of the day. Alger considered himself an individualist, a constitutionalist, and a man of principles. Critics, however, equated his principles to stubbornness. His belief in limited government conflicted with many of his colleagues, who expected to trade for votes on various issues and projects, something he refused to do. In the era of civil rights, he believed that solutions lay with local, not national government. He maintained that the national government should concentrate on defense and foreign affairs. He believed that the responsibility for social programs belonged at the local level. He was the only member of the House, for example, to oppose the popular school lunch program. Despite being in the majority of the Texan delegation to decline to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto opposing the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, Alger voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. According to Time magazine (January 6, 1958), Alger assessed the upcoming second session of the Democratic 85th Congress in a pessimistic but resolved vein: \\"I foresee bitterness and hatefulness... We are going to squabble and fight and make the world think we hate each other and that we can't solve our problems. We are going to have bigger and bigger budgets, higher taxes, more government spending at home and abroad, and more inflation accompanied by deficit financing. Happy New Year!\\" In 1960, Alger organized a protest at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas against Lyndon Johnson, by then the U.S. Senate majority leader, who was campaigning to become vice president as John F. Kennedy's running mate. Alger held a placard which stated, \\"LBJ Sold Out to Yankee Socialists.\\" The rally turned ugly, and Lady Bird Johnson was spat upon by a protestor,Jack Crichton, The Republican-Democrat Political Campaigns in Texas in 1964, self-published, 2004, p. 11, (paperback) and her white gloves were yanked from her and thrown into a gutter. Vice President Richard M. Nixon believed that the incident caused him to lose Texas's then twenty-four electoral votes to Kennedy and Johnson. Columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak said that the protest also impacted the votes of white southerners in other states. Nixon later said, \\"Well, we lost Texas in 1960 because of that a**hole congressman in Dallas\\". House Speaker Sam Rayburn of Bonham particularly disliked Alger and was often brutal toward the Republican \\"interloper\\" in the Texas delegation. Lyndon Johnson, on the other hand, was often deferential to the Republican U.S. Senator John G. Tower, Johnson's 1960 general election opponent and long-term Senate successor, because of Tower's support for Johnson on the Vietnam War. Rayburn, though friendly with House Republican Leader Joseph W. Martin of Massachusetts, would have been elated had he lived to see Alger defeated after a decade of House service.Anthony Champagne, University of Texas at Dallas, \\"Sam Rayburn\\", West Texas Historical Association, annual meeting in Fort Worth, February 26, 2010. Defeated for reelection, 1964 In 1956 and 1958, Alger defeated two Democrats who later became well-known names in the state. In 1956, he edged Henry Wade, the Dallas County district attorney who emerged seventeen years later as the defendant in the Roe v. Wade abortion case. Alger polled 102,380 (55.6 percent) to Wade's 81,705 (44.4 percent).Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections, Vol. 2, U.S. House, 6th ed., Washington, D.C.: Congressional Quarterly, p. 1255. In 1958, a heavily Democratic year nationally, Alger defeated Barefoot Sanders, 62,722 (52.6 percent) to 56,566 (47.4 percent).Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections, Vol. 2, p. 1260 Sanders was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee against Senator John Tower in 1972 and was later appointed a U.S. District Judge by President Carter. In 1962, Alger won his last term in the House with 89,938 votes (56.3 percent) to Democrat Bill Jones' 69,813 (43.7 percent). Alger was unseated in the 1964 general election by the former mayor of Dallas, Democrat Earle Cabell. Alger polled 127,568 ballots (only 42.5 percent), a considerable number of votes in a House election. Yet, turnout was so much higher in 1964 than in 1962 that Alger lost even though he polled nearly 40,000 more votes in the latter year than in the former. Cabell prevailed with 172,287 (57.5 percent). Alger's defeat can be attributed to: #The Democratic trend of Dallas voters in the 1964 election, who also purged the entire six-member Republican state legislative delegation from Dallas County, #The political climate that stemmed from the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas, #The Democratic tradition of Texas, #The presence of a native Texan, President Johnson, on the ballot, and #The weak opposition candidacy of Alger's preferred presidential choice, Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. In a 1971 interview with the historian Joe B. Frantz of the University of Texas, John Tower discussed his relationship with Alger, noting that Tower would have deferred to Alger in the 1961 special U.S. Senate election had Alger wanted to run: \\"Bruce and I got along very well together. Bruce is a very inflexible man and a suspicious man. He questioned the intellectual honesty of men like Mr. Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson, and so he just didn't make any friends. I have never yet publicly said one disparaging word about a fellow member of the Texas delegation, and don't intend to, although some of them have been inclined to say things about me publicly from time to time. I won't respond.\\" Return to private life After a decade in Congress, Alger resumed working as a real estate broker. He formed Bruce Alger, Real Estate in 1973. The company had offices in Dallas' One North Park building. He moved for a time to Florida but returned to Dallas in 1976. Alger resided in Carrollton, which is located in three Dallas-area counties. He remained out of the political limelight except for a few occasional public appearances. Alger's congressional papers are located in the archives section of the Dallas Public Library. Alger was divorced in 1961 from Lucille \\"Lynn\\" Antoine, who said that politics caused an estrangement in the marriage to point that they had little in common except for a liking for gin rummy. The couple had three children, Jill Alger of The Villages in Sumter County in central Florida] and sons David and Steven, who died in 1964 and 2012, respectively. Alger's second wife, the former Priscilla Jones, also died in 2012, after thirty-six years of marriage. He had two step-children in Massachusetts, Robert Jones of Amherst and Laura Jones of Chatham. Alger had seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Alger retired in 1990 and spent ten years with his wife Priscilla traveling around the United States in a recreational vehicle. The couple settled in 2000 in Barefoot Bay in Brevard County near Melbourne on the central section of the Atlantic Coast of Florida. On April 13, 2015, Alger died of heart disease at the age of ninety-six at an assisted living facility in Palm Bay, also in Brevard County, Florida.

He was imprisoned in the Tower of London for alleged crimes against Mary Tudor. He was burned at the stake on 1 July 1555. Life Bradford in prison with bishops from Foxe's Book of Martyrs Bradford was born in the village of Blackley, Near Manchester in 1510. He was educated at a grammar school. Talented with numbers and money, he later served under Sir John Harington of Exton in Rutland as a servant. Through his good influence and abilities in auditing and writing, he gained favour and trust with his employer and at the Siege of Montreuil in 1544, occupied the office of paymaster of the English army during the wars of Henry VIII. Later, he became a law student at the Inner Temple in London. Through the contact and preachings of a fellow student, he became acquainted with and converted to the Protestant faith. This caused him to abandon his legal studies and in 1548, he took up theology at Catharine Hall (now St Catharine's College), University of Cambridge. In 1549 he was awarded his MA and in that same year was appointed to a fellowship at Pembroke College, Cambridge.Alumni Cantabrigienses: A Biographical List of All Known Students, Graduates ... By John Venn Bradford Appeasing the Riot at St. Paul's CrossFrom an 1887 edition of Foxe's Book of Martyrs illustrated by Kronheim. According to Foxe, a Catholic speaker, Mr. Bourne, had nearly driven his Protestant listeners to riot, but Bradford came to his rescue and calmed the mob.John Foxe (1887 republication), Book of Martyrs, Frederick Warne and Co, London and New York, pp. 160‚Äì61At this institution he was often referred to with the nickname \\"Holy Bradford\\" not from malice but out of respect for his dedication to God and his unselfish attitude. In August 1550 he was ordained deacon by Bishop Nicholas Ridley and appointed as his personal chaplain. He began preaching in churches in London under the mentorship of Ridley and Hugh Latimer.see C.H. Stuart, Latimer: Apostle to the English. Zondervan, 1986. His gifts in preaching the Biblical faith led to his appointment in 1551 as Chaplain to King Edward VI and Prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral. He continued as a Fellow of Pembroke and as a roving preacher, mainly in London, Lancashire and Cheshire. Following the death of Edward in 1553, Mary Tudor ascended to the throne bringing the threat of reprisals against opponents of Catholicism. In the first month of the new monarch's reign, Bradford was arrested and imprisoned on the seemingly trivial charge of \\"trying to stir up a mob\\" and committed to the Tower of London. Although seemingly trivial, at the time \\"stirring up a mob\\" was a serious and dangerous act, leading to riot and possible death, and certainly major disturbance to society. During his time in prison, he continued to write religious works and preach to all who would listen. For a time whilst in the Tower, Bradford was put in a cell with three other reformers, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer. Their time was spent in careful study of the New Testament. Death On 31 January 1555, Bradford was tried and condemned to death. Bradford was taken to Newgate Prison to be burned at the stake on 1 July. Bradford was given a special \\"Shirt of Flame\\" by a Mrs. Marlet, for whom he had written a devotional work. This was a clean shirt that was sewn specifically for the burning, made in the style of a wedding shirt. \\"This clothing with a new shirt to wear at the stake became a common feature at the burnings, a way of signaling support for and honouring the victim, as though he were being dressed as a bridegroom for a wedding.\\" Also, the ceremonial donning of the shirt of flame could be seen as similar to the priest donning his vestments, thus subverting Catholic ritual. \\"...and so the martyr might pray over and kiss the shirt before putting it on... underlining their oneness with Christ and the fact they were willing to die...\\" Rounding, Virginia. The Burning Time: Henry VIII, Bloody Mary, and the Protestant Martyrs of London. 2017. Page 287. A large crowd delayed the execution, which had been scheduled for 4 o'clock in the morning, as many who admired Bradford came to witness his death. He was chained to the stake at Smithfield with a young man, John Leaf. Before the fire was lit, he begged forgiveness of any he had wronged, and offered forgiveness to those who had wronged him. He then turned to Leaf and said, \\"Be of good comfort brother; for we shall have a merry supper with the Lord this night!\\" A century later, in his Worthies of England, Thomas Fuller wrote that he endured the flame \\"as a fresh gale of wind in a hot summer's day, confirming by his death the truth of that doctrine he had so diligently and powerfully preached during his life.\\"Stoeffler, F. Ernest. 1971. The rise of evangelical pietism.]p.43. Bradford is commemorated at the Marian Martyrs' Monument in Smithfield, London. He is also commemorated with one of the six statues on the exterior of Manchester Town Hall marking people important in the early history of the city.Manchester Town Hall - A visitor guide Phrase attribution There is a 19th-century tradition tracing to Bradford the idiomatic \\"There but for the grace of God go I\\" as an expression of humility and reliance on God's grace rather than his own morality. The editor of The Writings of John Bradford, Aubrey Townsend, notes this in his preface:also mentioned by The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (vol. 6 (1885), p. 159), \\"There is a tradition that on seeing some criminals going to execution he exclaimed: 'But for the grace of God there goes John Bradford. The tradition of attribution of the phrase to Bradford dates to at least the early 19th century, as it is found in A treatise on prayer by Edward Bickersteth (1822): While the phrase, or its attribution to Bradford, cannot be traced to before 1800, Townsend notes that there is a 17th-century attribution of a similar sentiment to Bradford, demonstrating how \\"by the sight of others' sins, men may learn to bewail their own sinfulness\\". According to this tradition, Bradford, \\"when he saw any drunk or heard any swear, &c.;, would railingly complain, 'Lord I have a drunken head; Lord, I have a swearing heart.Ralph Venning, The heathen improved, an appendix to Canaan's Flowings, sect. 110, p. 222, London. 1653. But there are other attributions for the phrase \\"there but for the grace of God\\"; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (in the voice of Sherlock Holmes) attributes the phrase to Richard Baxter (1615‚Äì1691) in The Boscombe Valley Mystery (1891): The phrase has also been attributed to John Newton (1725‚Äì1807)the suggestion was put forward, apparently from memory, by George Borrow in his influential Lavengro: The Scholar‚Äîthe Gypsy‚Äîthe Priest, Part 2, 1851, p. 37 : \\"it was old John Newton, I think, who, when he saw a man going to be hanged, said: 'There goes John Newton, but for the grace of God!\\" and in Catholic tradition to Philip Neri (1515‚Äì1595).\\"There thou goest, Philip, but for the grace of God!\\" Patrick Augustine Sheehan, Under the Cedars and Stars (1903), Part H, chapter 20.

The duchess was the richest woman in Great Britain of her time and had the largest natural history collection in the country, complete with its own curator, the parson- naturalist John Lightfoot, and the Swedish botanist Daniel Solander. Her collection included costly art objects such as the Portland Vase. Her ambition for her collection was for it to contain and to describe every living species. She was a member of the Bluestockings, a group of social intellectuals led by women and founded by her great friend Elizabeth Montagu. She was also fourth great grandmother of Queen Elizabeth II through her mother's side. Early life She was the only surviving child of the 2nd Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, bibliophile, collector and patron of the arts, and the former Lady Henrietta Holles (1694-1755, the only child and heir of the 1st Duke of Newcastle and his wife, the former Lady Margaret Cavendish). Lady Margaret grew up at Wimpole Hall in Cambridgeshire, surrounded by books, paintings, sculpture and in the company of writers such as Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift and Matthew Prior as well as aristocrats and politicians. As a child, she collected pets and natural history objects (especially seashells) and was encouraged by her father and her paternal grandfather, the 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, to do so. Marriage and issue At 19, on 11 July 1734, in Oxford Chapel, Marylebone, she married the 2nd Duke of Portland, her 'Sweet Will', and they later had six children (all born at Welbeck Abbey): # Lady Elizabeth Bentinck (1735‚Äì1825) - Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath # Lady Henrietta Bentinck (1737‚Äì1827) - George Grey, 5th Earl of Stamford # William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (1738‚Äì1809), third great grandfather to Queen Elizabeth II. # Lady Margaret Bentinck (c. 1740‚Äì1756) # Lady Frances Bentinck (c. 1742‚Äì1743) # Lord Edward Charles Bentinck (1744‚Äì1819) In 1738‚Äì1756 the scholar Elizabeth Elstob was their tutor. As a collector By the November following her marriage, her collecting had gathered pace, expanding to include the decorative and fine arts as well as natural history. (She was already heiress to the Arundel collection.) Her home in Buckinghamshire, Bulstrode Hall, provided space to house the results, and her independent fortune meant that cost was no object (on her mother‚Äôs death in 1755 she also inherited the estates of Welbeck in Nottinghamshire). Bulstrode was known in court circles as \\"The Hive\\" for the intense work done there on the collections by the Duchess and her team of botanists, entomologists and ornithologists, headed by herself, Daniel Solander (1736‚Äì82, specialising in seashells and insects) and The Revd John Lightfoot (1735‚Äì88, her librarian and chaplain, and an expert botanist). Her collection was, unlike many similar contemporary ones, well-curated. In 1766, the Genevan Romantic and philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau met Bentinck, admired her knowledge of botany, despite his opinion that women could not be scientific, and offered his services as her \\"herborist\\" (plant collector). She corresponded with Rousseau until she sent him a copy of Georg Rumpf's Herbarium amboinense, a botany of Amboyna in what is now Indonesia, as he felt this opposed his ideal of free nature. The Portland Museum at Bulstrode was open to visitors, along with its zoo, aviary and vast botanic garden. Many came: scholars, philosophers, scientists and even royalty, and the collection became a cause c√©l√®bre. Her fellow collector Horace Walpole commented on it: or, in the words of Mrs Delany (a botanical artist and longtime friend): Her collecting was also encouraged by her creative milieu: the Duchess and Delany were both members of The Bluestockings, a group of aristocratic women seeking increased intellectual opportunities for members of their sex. Her natural collection was the largest and most famous of its time, with few geographical bounds; it included objects from both Lapland and the South Seas (she patronised James Cook and bought shells from his second voyage through dealers). She drew and recorded its specimens, sorting them innovatively in type species and displaying them alongside ancient remains such as the Portland Vase, which she bought from Sir William Hamilton. Lightfoot later wrote in the introduction to the 1786 auction catalogue that it was her \\"intention to have had every unknown species in the three kingdoms of nature described and published to the world\\", but this was thwarted by Solander's death in 1783 and her own two years later. On her death, with her children uninterested in the collection, her son's political career to finance and her creditors' demands to be paid, it was her will that it be sold. The collection was entirely dissolved at an auction of over 4,000 lots at her Whitehall residence from 24 April to 3 July 1786. Hundreds of people attended, although some fine and decorative arts were bought back by her family at the auction, including the Portland Vase and pieces from a silver-gilt dessert service the Duchess had designed herself, crawling with exquisitely modelled insects. However, the vast majority went, including the whole natural history collection; Walpole records that only eight days included items other than \\"shells, ores, fossils, birds' eggs and natural history.\\"Madeleine Pelling, 'Selling the Duchess: Narratives of Celebrity in 'A Catalogue of the Portland Museum (1786)' in Early Modern Women, vol. 13 no. 2 (Spring, 2019), pp. 3-32 quote at p. 15. Only fragments of the Portland Museum's building survive too, since Bulstrode was demolished in the 19th century. The department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham holds some of the personal papers and correspondence of the Duchess of Portland (Pw E), as part of the Portland (Welbeck) Collection. The Harley Gallery's Treasury Museum shows changing displays of objects from the Portland Collection.  Foundling Hospital  The duchess was one of the twenty-one Signatories to the Ladies' Petition for the Establishment of the Foundling Hospital. These 'ladies of quality and distinction' supported Thomas Coram's campaign to create England's first Foundling Hospital; she signed his petition to King George II on 7 May 1735.Gillian Wagner, Thomas Coram, Gent. 1668-1751(Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2004),123,199 Their recognition of the need for a home for orphans and abandoned children was crucial in encouraging male relatives to support Coram's project. As a result of their influence he gained signatures from the nobility, professionals, gentlemen and the judiciary for two further petitions in 1737.Ruth McClure, Coram's Children: The London Foundling Hospital in the Eighteenth Century (New Haven, London: Yale, 1981), 27, 34 A Royal Charter was granted in 1739 to which her husband, William Bentinck, was one of the first signatories. Her father, Edward Harley, signed Coram's gentlemen's petition on the same day. See also *List of natural history dealers References Bibliography * R. G. W.

Along with former vocalist Doug Venable, Parrish was the main songwriter for the band that resulted in its trademark melodic hardcore and Christian hardcore sound on The Frailty of Words and No Wings to Speak Of. Despite the creative and personnel differences he had with the other members, Parrish was still the primary songwriter on The Satellite Years. Parrish would later rejoin the band in May 2019.

It holds football and athletics competitions. Since 1992 the Daugava Stadium has been designated as a sports facility of national importance and is owned by the Government of Latvia. History The first stadium on the location was built in 1927 and was first operated by the StrƒÅdnieku sports un sargs (Worker Sports and Guard, SSS) sports organization affiliated with the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party. After the stadium had been abandoned after the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 and during, World War II, the stadium was re-established in 1945, with renovation works beginning in 1949. Before July 1990 the total capacity of the stadium was more than 10,000 people, but after the demolition of the north, east and south stands in 1999 it was only 5,683. The Latvian national football team was playing its home games at the Daugava stadium from 1991 until 2000, when Skonto Stadium was unveiled as a temporary location while the planned renovation of Daugava Stadium was underway, with the team returning to Daugava in the summer of 2018. The second tenant since June 2018 is FS Metta/LU. Previous tenants have included FC Daugava, FK Daugava 90, JFK Olimps and others. Two exercise venues under the main stand, tennis and athletics grounds and artificial turf pitches are also a part of the complex. The Latvian Football Federation headquarters were located within the complex from 1991 until 2009, when the offices were moved to the Elektrum Olympic Center. The Daugava Stadium has traditionally hosted the dance performances of the Latvian Song and Dance Festival. To celebrate the 90th anniversary of the independence of Latvia, on October 19, 2008, a new Guinness World Record was set at the venue for the most people running 100 metres in a 24-hour relay. There were 3,807 participants.  Renovation projects  The project for the renovation of the stadium received funds from the European Regional Development Fund and the Latvian government in 2015 and the works officially started in September 2017, after a ‚Ç¨62 million contract was signed on June 5 for the reconstruction of the stadium and the creation of the Grƒ´zi≈Ükalns sports and culture district in its surroundings. On 15 May 2018, the first phase of the renovation was completed, in the course of which new stands were built on both goal ends, increasing the capacity of the stadium from 5,683 seats to 10,461 seats, the main western stand with its indoor athletics facilities, conference rooms and VIP facilities were fully renovated and a new electronic scoreboard display was installed. After the renovation the stadium now meets UEFA Category 4 and IAAF Category 2 requirements. The second and final phase ‚Äì during which the construction of a roof over the west terrace, a new ice rink replacing the one built in 1960 (demolished in 2018) and new, multi-functional sports halls is planned ‚Äì is scheduled to be completed by 2022. In April 2020 the construction of the new ice arena was started after the final construction permit was issued by the Riga City Council. The deadline for the unveiling of the venue is set for March 2021 in time for the 2021 IIHF World Championship.

He ordered the construction of the Neo-Classical style Te≈üvikiye Police Station and the Neo-Baroque style Te≈üvikiye Mosque for a proper district, encouraging the citizens of Istanbul to settle in the area (hence the name Te≈üvikiye which means Encouragement in Ottoman Turkish). The word Ni≈üanta≈üƒ± literally means \\"Aiming Stone\\" in Turkish. Aiming stones were erected in the Ottoman period to mark the archery range records of the Ottoman archers and sultans. Some of these aiming stones, which are shaped like small obelisks and have Ottoman Turkish inscriptions on them, are still found on the pavements of Ni≈üanta≈üƒ± as monuments from the past. The inscriptions give information about the date, the shooter and the distance the arrow was thrown.Tirendaz.com: Menzil Ok√ßuluƒüu Following the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913, many Turks from Macedonia, especially Thessaloniki (Sel√¢nik, which was an Ottoman metropolis until 1912) settled in the Ni≈üanta≈üƒ± quarter of Istanbul; including the family of the famous Turkish poet N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet. Apart from the Turks, the quarter also had sizeable Greek, Jewish, Armenian and Levantine communities. The building of Ma√ßka Technical High School (Ma√ßka Akif Tuncel Teknik ve End√ºstri Meslek Lisesi) was originally constructed by the Italians to become their country's new embassy in Istanbul.Emporis: Ma√ßka Technical High School However, when Ankara became Turkey's new capital in 1923, the building was donated to the Turkish Republic and has been used as a school ever since.

Culture in the Low Countries at the end of the 15th century was influenced by the Italian Renaissance, through trade via Bruges, which made Flanders wealthy. Its nobles commissioned artists who became known across Europe. In science, the anatomist Andreas Vesalius led the way; in cartography, Gerardus Mercator's map assisted explorers and navigators. In art, Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting went from the strange work of Hieronymus Bosch to the everyday life of Pieter Brueghel the Elder. In architecture, music and literature too, the culture of the Low Countries moved into the Renaissance style. Geopolitical situation and background Map showing the political situation in the Low Countries between 1556 and 1648. In 1500, the Seventeen Provinces were in a personal union under the Burgundian Dukes, and with the Flemish cities as centers of gravity, culturally and economically formed one of the richest parts of Europe. During the course of the century the region also experienced significant changes. Humanism and Reformation led to a rebellion against the Spanish rule of Philip II of Spain and the start of the religious war. By the end of the 16th century the Northern and Southern Netherlands were effectively split. While this fracture was reflected in the visual arts by the Dutch Golden Age in the north and the Flemish Baroque in the south, other areas of thought remained associated with 16th-century currents of Renaissance thought. Gradually, the balance of power shifted away from the Southern Netherlands, which remained under Spanish authority, to the emerging Dutch Republic. Two factors determined the fate of the region in the 16th century. The first was the union with the kingdom of Spain through the 1496 marriage of Philip the Handsome of Burgundy and Juana of Castile. Their son, Charles V, born in Ghent, would inherit the largest empire in the world, and the Netherlands, although a prominent part of the empire, became dependent on a large foreign power. A second factor included religious developments. The Middle Ages gave way to new modes of religious thinking. Devotio Moderna practices, for example, were particularly strong in the region, while the 16th-century criticisms of the Catholic Church that spread throughout Europe also reached the Low Countries. Humanists such as Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam were critical but remained loyal to the church. However, the spread of the Protestant Reformation, started by Martin Luther in 1517, eventually led to outright war. The Reformation, particularly the ideas of John Calvin, gained significant support in the Low Countries, and following the 1566 iconoclastic outbreaks Spain attempted to quell the tide and maintain the authority of the post-Tridentine Church through force by installing Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba. The repression that followed led to the Dutch Revolt, the beginning of the Eighty Years War, and the establishment of the Dutch Republic in the northern provinces. Subsequently, the Southern Netherlands became a bastion for the Counter Reformation, while Calvinism was the main religion of those in power in the Dutch Republic. Influence of the Italian Renaissance Desiderius Erasmus in 1523 Trade in the port of Bruges and the textile industry, mostly in Ghent, turned Flanders into the wealthiest part of Northern Europe at the end of the 15th century. The Burgundian court dwelled mostly in Bruges, Ghent and Brussels. The nobles and rich traders were able to commission artists, creating a class of highly skilled painters and musicians who were admired and requested around the continent. This led to frequent exchanges between the Low Countries and Northern Italy. Examples are Italian architects Tommaso Vincidor and Alessandro Pasqualini, who worked in the Low Countries for most of their careers, Flemish painter Jan Gossaert, whose visit to Italy in 1508 in the company of Philip of Burgundy left a deep impression, musician Adrian Willaert who made Venice into the most important musical centre of its time (see Venetian School) and Giambologna, a Flemish sculptor who spent his most productive years in Florence. Before 1500, the Italian Renaissance had little or no influence above the Alps. After this we begin to see Renaissance influences, but unlike the Italian Renaissance, Gothic elements remain important. The revival of the classical period is also not a central theme like in Italy, the \\"rebirth\\" shows itself more as a return to nature and earthly beauty. Renaissance in the Low Countries Art Hell, the right panel from the triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch Landscape with the Fall of Icarus after Pieter Bruegel the Elder Fifteenth- century painting in the Low Countries still shows strong religious influences, contrary to the Germanic painting. Even after 1500, when Renaissance influences begin to show, the influence of the masters from the previous century leads to a largely religious and narrative style of painting. The first painter showing the marks of the new era is Hieronymus Bosch. His work is strange and full of seemingly irrational imagery, making it difficult to interpret. Most of all it seems surprisingly modern, introducing a world of dreams that highly contrasts with the traditional style of the Flemish masters of his day. After 1550, the Flemish and Dutch painters begin to show more interest in nature and in beauty an sich, leading to a style that incorporates Renaissance elements, but remains very far from the elegant lightness of Italian Renaissance art, and directly leads to the themes of the great Flemish and Dutch Baroque painters: landscapes, still lifes and genre painting ‚Äì scenes from everyday life. This evolution is seen in the works of Joachim Patinir and Pieter Aertsen, but the true genius among these painters was Pieter Brueghel the Elder, well known for his depictions of nature and everyday life, showing a preference for the natural condition of man, choosing to depict the peasant instead of the prince. The Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, now thought to be an early copy, combines several elements of northern Renaissance painting. It hints at the renewed interest for antiquity (the Icarus legend), but the hero Icarus is hidden away in the background. The main actors in the painting are nature itself and, most prominently, the peasant, who does not even look up from his plough when Icarus falls. Brueghel shows man as an anti-hero, comical and sometimes grotesque. Architecture and sculpture As in painting, Renaissance architecture took some time to reach the High Countries, and did not entirely supplant the Gothic elements. The most important sculptor in the Southern Netherlands was Giambologna, who spent most of his career in Italy. An architect directly influenced by the Italian masters was Cornelis Floris de Vriendt, who designed the city hall of Antwerp, finished in 1564. Sluter, The Well of Moses, 1395-1405In sculpture, however, 15th-century Netherlandish artists, while adhering to Christian subjects, developed techniques and a naturalistic style which compares favorably to the work of early-Renaissance Italian contemporaries such as Donatello. Claus Sluter (fl. ~1400) produced works such as the Well of Moses with a dynamism almost unknown at the turn of the 15th century; and Dutch-born Nikolaus Gerhaert van Leyden (b. ~1420) made sculptures such as \\"Man Meditating\\", which even today appear more \\"modern\\" than does Italian Quattrocento carving. Gerhaert, Man Meditating, 1467 In the early-17th century Dutch Republic, Hendrick de Keyser plays an important role in developing the Amsterdam Renaissance style, not slavishly following the classical style but incorporating many decorative elements, giving a result that could also be categorized as Mannerism. Hans Vredeman de Vries was another important name, primarily as a garden architect. Music Orlande de Lassus leading a chamber ensemble, painted by Hans Mielich While in painting the Low Countries were leading Northern Europe, in music the Franco-Flemish or Dutch School dominated all of Europe. In the early Renaissance, polyphonic music composers from the Low Countries such as Johannes Ciconia were working at all the European courts and churches. Educated in the church and cathedral schools of their own region, they spread out and would bring their style to the whole continent, so that by the late Renaissance a unified musical style emerged throughout Europe. Although there is no reference to antiquity, there is a clear Flemish \\"Renaissance consciousness\\", as indicated by the words of Flemish theorist Johannes Tinctoris, who said of these composers: \\"Although it is beyond belief, nothing worth listening to had been composed before their time\\". Renaissance elements in the music are the return from the \\"divine origin\\" of music to earthly beauty and sensory joy. The music becomes more structured, balanced and melodic. Whereas in the Middle Ages the choice of instruments was free, composers now start to organize instruments into homogenous groups, and write music specifically for certain arrangements. Josquin des Prez was the most celebrated composer during the High Renaissance, and during his career enjoyed the patronage of three popes. Equally at ease in secular and religious music, he can be considered the first musical genius we know of. Other important composers from the Low Countries were Guillaume Dufay, Johannes Ockeghem, Jacob Clemens non Papa and Adrian Willaert. Orlande de Lassus, a Fleming who had lived in Italy as a youth and spent most of his career in Munich, was the leading composer of the late Renaissance. Literature Antwerp City Hall (finished in 1564) In the middle of the 16th century, a group of rhetoricians (see Medieval Dutch literature) in Brabant and Flanders attempted to put new life into the stereotyped forms of the preceding age by introducing in original composition the new-found branches of Latin and Greek poetry. The leader of these men was Johan Baptista Houwaert, who was led by an unbounded love of classical and mythological fancy. The most important genre was music publishing, especially psalms. The Souterliedekens publication is one of the most important sources for the reconstruction of Renaissance folksongs. Later publishing was heavily influenced by the rebellion against the Spanish: heroic battle songs and political ballads ridiculing the Spanish occupants. Best remembered of the writers is Philips van Marnix, lord of Sint-Aldegonde, who was one of the leading spirits in the war of Dutch independence. He wrote a satire on the Roman Catholic Church, started to work on a Bible translation and allegedly wrote the lyrics to the Dutch national anthem. Other important names are Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert, Hendrick Laurensz. Spieghel and Roemer Visscher. Inevitably, their works and career were very much determined by the struggle between Reformation and the Catholic Church. Science Gerardus Mercator's map of Europe, 1554 The new age presents itself in science as well. Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius's life typically shows both the new possibilities and the troubles that came with them. He delivered ground-breaking work on human anatomy, after centuries of disregard for it. This earned him great respect from some, but also caused several enquiries into his methods (dissection of the human body) and the religious implications of his work. While Vesalius performed ground-breaking work in rediscovering the human body, Gerardus Mercator, as one of the leading cartographers of his time, did the same for rediscovering the outside world. Mercator too came into trouble with the Church because of his beliefs, and spent several months in jail after a conviction for heresy. Both scientists' lives show how the Renaissance scientist is not afraid of challenging what has been taken for granted for centuries, and how this leads to problems with the all-powerful Catholic Church. Though the invention of the printing press by Laurens Janszoon Coster in the 1430s appears to be a romantic notion, the Low Countries had an early start in printing. By 1470 a printing press was in use in Utrecht, where the first dated extant book was printed in 1473, while the first book in the Dutch language was the 1477 Delft Bible. By 1481 the Low Countries had printing shops in 21 cities and towns.E. L. Eisenstein: The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe, Cambridge, 1993 pp.13‚Äì17, quoted in: Angus Maddison: Growth and Interaction in the World Economy: The Roots of Modernity, Washington 2005, p.17f. Famous publishing houses like those of Christoffel Plantijn in Antwerp from 1555 on, Petrus Phalesius the Elder in Leuven from 1553, and the House of Elzevir in Leiden from around 1580 turned the Low Countries into a regional center of publishing.

The Latin specific epithet speciosa means ‚Äúshowy‚Äù. Description It is a medium-sized, deciduous tree growing to 15‚Äì30 meters tall and 12 meters wide. It has a trunk up to 1 m diameter, with brown to gray bark maturing into hard plates or ridges. The leaves are deciduous, opposite (or whorled), large, heart shaped, 20‚Äì30 cm long and 15‚Äì20 cm broad, pointed at the tip and softly hairy beneath. The leaves generally do not color in autumn before falling, instead, they either fall abruptly after the first hard freeze, or turn a slightly yellow-brown before dropping off. The catalpa tree is the last tree to grow leaves in the spring. The winter twigs of northern catalpa are like those of few other trees, having sunken leaf scars that resemble suction cups. Their whorled arrangement (three scars per node) around the twigs is another diagnostic. The flowers are 3‚Äì6 cm across, trumpet shaped, white with yellow stripes and purple spots inside; they grow in panicles of 10-30. The fruit is a long, thin legume-like capsule, 20‚Äì40 cm long and 10‚Äì12 mm diameter; it often stays attached to tree during winter (and can be mistaken for brown icicles). The pod contains numerous flat, light brown seeds with two papery wings. It is closely related to southern catalpa, and can be distinguished by the flowering panicles, which bear a smaller number of larger flowers, and the slightly broader seed pods. Distribution Catalpa speciosa was originally thought to be native only to a small area of the midwestern United States near the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. However, in 1976, investigation of an archeological site of an island in West Virginia's portion of the Ohio River revealed Catalpa speciosa to be present on the island around the period of 1500-1700 CE. This suggests that Catalpa speciosa may have experienced a decline in range before European settlement. Today, its range has widely expanded east of the Rocky Mountains outside of its restricted pre-settlement location, further obscuring its true native range.Hemmings, E. Thomas and Earl L. Core (Mar., 1976). \\"Archeological Evidence for Range Extension of the Catawba Tree (Catalpa speciosa Warder) in West Virginia\\". Castanea 41(1):9-11 Cultivation and uses It is widely planted as an ornamental tree. It is adapted to moist, high pH soil and full sun, but has been able to grow almost anywhere in North America. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017). The wood is soft, like white pine, and light, weighing only 26 pounds per cubic foot when dry. It also does not rot easily; in earlier years it was used for fence posts and less than successfully as railroad ties. More modern uses that highlight the wood's beautiful grain include furniture, interior trim and cabinetry. Catalpa has one of the lowest shrinkage/expansion rates of any U.S. hardwood. Only northern white cedar and redwood have lower shrinkage/expansion rates, and not by much. The wood's unique properties make it excellent for carving and boat- building. Often regarded as a weed tree, its wood is under-appreciated and underused. The tree's tendency to grow crooked does not help its reputation as a source of usable lumber. Northern catalpa has been extensively cultivated in Ohio for over 200 years, and is now naturalized in urban and rural areas. Farmers introduced the rapidly growing northern catalpa to Ohio to produce large amounts of timber for fenceposts. Three liabilities exist in urban areas where it is found as both a shade and an ornamental tree. Northern catalpa rains down fragments of its long fruits and fringed seeds from winter through spring, creating a cleanup chore. In addition, it often gets far too big for its allocated space in the landscape, and crowds out or casts too much shade on other desirable plants. Finally, its brittle wood, coupled with tree height, makes its branches at times subject to wind or ice damage. The tree is often sought out by fishing enthusiasts, not for the plant itself, but for a common parasite that is used as bait. The catalpa moth caterpillar, Ceratomia catalpae, is widely regarded as one of the best live baits, and the tree may be planted strictly for this purpose, and has earned the tree common names of worm tree, or bait tree. Diseases Although northern catalpa can have several diseases and pests, most are usually minor and pose no serious threat. The exception is the caterpillar of Ceratomia catalpae, which can on occasion defoliate the tree, although without causing the tree much harm.

The Siloam Tunnel (, Nikbat HaShiloah), also known as Hezekiah's Tunnel, is a water channel that was carved beneath the City of David, located in the Arab neighborhood of Silwan in eastern Jerusalem, in ancient times. Its popular name is due to the most common hypothesis that it dates from the reign of Hezekiah of Judah (late 8th and early 7th century BC) and corresponds to the \\"water works\\" mentioned in in the Hebrew Bible. According to the Bible, King Hezekiah prepared Jerusalem for an impending siege by the Assyrians, by \\"blocking the source of the waters of the upper Gihon, and leading them straight down on the west to the City of David\\" (). Support for the dating to Hezekiah's period is derived from the Biblical text that describes construction of a tunnel and to radiocarbon dates of organic matter contained in the original plastering. However, the dates were challenged in 2011 by new excavations that suggested an earlier origin in the late 9th or early 8th century BC. The tunnel leads from the Gihon Spring to the Pool of Siloam.Image of exitHoly Land PhotosImage If indeed built under Hezekiah, it dates to a time when Jerusalem was preparing for an impending siege by the Assyrians, led by Sennacherib. Since the Gihon Spring was already protected by a massive tower and was included in the city's defensive wall system, Jerusalem seems to have been supplied with enough water in case of siege even without this tunnel. According to Ahron Horovitz, director of the Megalim Institute, the tunnel can be interpreted as an additional aqueduct designed for keeping the entire outflow of the spring inside the walled area, which included the downstream Pool of Siloam, with the specific purpose of withholding water from any besieging forces. Both the spring itself, and the pool at the end of the tunnel, would have been used by the inhabitants as water sources. Troops positioned outside the walls wouldn't have reached any of it, because even the overflow water released from the Pool of Siloam would have fully disappeared into a karstic system located right outside the southern tip of the city walls. In contrast to that, the previous water system did release all the water not used by the city population into the Kidron Valley to the east, where besieging troops could have taken advantage of it. The curving tunnel is 583 yards (533 m) long and by using the 12 inch (30 cm) altitude difference between its two ends, which corresponds to a 0.06 percent gradient, the engineers managed to convey the water from the spring to the pool. According to the Siloam inscription, the tunnel was excavated by two teams, one starting at each end of the tunnel and then meeting in the middle. The inscription is partly unreadable at present, and may originally have conveyed more information than this. It is clear from the tunnel itself that several directional errors were made during its construction.Images of some mistakes - Recent scholarship has discredited the idea that the tunnel may have been formed by substantially widening a pre-existing natural karst. How the Israelite engineers dealt with the difficult feat of making two teams digging from opposite ends meet far underground is still not fully understood, but some suggest that the two teams were directed from above by sound signals generated by hammering on the solid rock through which the tunnelers were digging. Discovery and interpretation Tunnel in 2010 The tunnel was first described in modern times by Franciscus Quaresmius in 1625. It was later explored in 1838 by the American biblical scholar Edward Robinson, and in 1865 by Charles Warren. Neither Quaresmius nor Robinson identified the tunnel with Hezekiah, but in 1871 Warren suggested that the Pool of Siloam may have been \\"dug by King Hezekiah\\"The recovery of Jerusalem, by Captain Warren, quote: \\"This latter I suppose to have been the pool dug by King Hezekiah\\" and in 1884 following the discovery of the Siloam inscription wrote that: \\"The inscription thus appears to belong to the later period of the Hebrew monarchy, and may very well be considered to agree with the Biblical account of Hezekiah's preparations for Sennacherib's siege.\\"The survey of Western Palestine- Jerusalem (1884) p.348, Warren and Conder Function and origin The ancient city of Jerusalem, being on a mountain, is naturally defensible from almost all sides, but suffers from the drawback that its major source of fresh water, the Gihon Spring, is on the side of the cliff overlooking the Kidron Valley. This presents a major military weakness as the city walls, if high enough to be defensible, must necessarily leave the Gihon spring outside, thus leaving the city without a fresh water supply in case of siege. This weakness had been removed by the Canaanites who built a very strongly fortified tower around the spring and connected it to the city walls on the slope by an additional wall, which carried a well-protected corridor. A Canaanite tunnel already collected the spring water since ca. 1800 BC and led it southwards through the bedrock, but it released the water onto the fields in the Kidron Valley through several openings and ended in an open reservoir. While allowing for important farming, this arrangement also made water available to besieging troops outside the city walls. The Bible says that King Hezekiah (c. 8th century BC), fearful that the Assyrians would lay siege to the city, blocked the spring's water outside the city and diverted it through a channel into the then Pool of Siloam.Holy Land Photos However, it is now known (as of 1997) that the earlier Warren's shaft system had already heavily fortified the Gihon Spring;image of the (remains of the) fortifications Warren's shaft is not an aqueduct, and requires those desiring water to travel up and down it themselves‚Äîan arrangement that Hezekiah seemingly must have considered inadequate. In 1899, an ancient channel, also leading from the Gihon Spring halfway to the Siloam Pool area, but by a more direct route, was found. This channel is now known as the Middle Bronze Age channel, on account of its estimated age. Ronny Reich determined that it was constructed around 1800 BC (in the Middle Bronze Age), and thus that the spring's water had already been diverted many centuries before Hezekiah. As originally constructed, it is understood as a 20 feet deep ditch in the ground, covered over by large rock slabs (which were then hidden in the foliage). It is narrower than the tunnel, but can still be walked by a human for most of its length. In addition to the (3 ft high) exit near the Siloam pool, the channel has several small outlets that watered the gardens facing the Kidron Valley.Images of the Middle Bronze Age channel Biblical interpretation The Bible verses relating to a tunnel in Hezekiah's time are these: > \\"As for the other events of Hezekiah‚Äôs reign, all his achievements and how > he made the pool and the tunnel by which he brought water into the city, are > they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?\\" (2 Kings > 20:20) > \\"When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to wage > war against Jerusalem, he consulted with his officials and military staff > about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they > helped him. They gathered a large group of people who blocked all the > springs and the stream that flowed through the land. 'Why should the kings > of Assyria come and find plenty of water?' they said.\\" (2 Chronicles 32:2-4) > \\"It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and > channeled the water down to the west side of the City of David. He succeeded > in everything he undertook.\\" (2 Chronicles 32:30) > \\"You also saw the City of David, that it was great; And you gathered > together the waters of the lower pool. You also made a reservoir between the > two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to its Maker, > Nor did you have respect for him who fashioned it long ago.\\" () Doubts over dating Siloam inscription Excavation work in the tunnel by Ronny Reich of the University of Haifa and Eli Shukron of the Israel Antiquities Authority has cast doubt over the attribution of the tunnel to the reign of Hezekiah. They believe the evidence points to a date several decades earlier, in the last part of the 9th century or early part of the 8th century BC. They note that the biblical passage connecting Hezekiah to the construction of waterworks doesn't specify a place in the city, and suggest it might refer to waterworks in the Mamilla area. The revised dating is supported by De Groot and Fadida on the basis of pottery analysis.

The fresh fish that is caught is sometimes sold to the seafood restaurants in the area.

It is a sequel to his previous novel The Chosen. Set in 1950s New York, it continues the saga of the two friends, Reuven Malter, a Modern Orthodox Jew studying to become a rabbi, and Danny Saunders, a genius Hasidic Jew who has broken with his sect's tradition by refusing to take his father's place as rebbe in order to become a psychologist. The theme of the conflict between traditional and modern Orthodox Judaism that runs throughout The Chosen is expanded here against the backdrop of the changes that have taken place in Reuven and Danny's world in the period of time between the two novels: following World War II, European survivors of the Holocaust have come to America, rebuilding their shattered lives and often making their fiercely traditionalist religious viewpoint felt among their people. Plot summary The Promise starts a few months after The Chosen left off, with Danny having just started his graduate program in psychology and Reuven having started rabbinical school. The novel begins in the summer of 1950 when Reuven is dating a college student named Rachel Gordon. Rachel and Reuven take Rachel's cousin, Michael Gordon, to a carnival, where Michael has a mental breakdown over a carnival game. In the coming days, Michael's father Abraham Gordon, a secular rabbi and teacher, informs Reuven that Michael has a history of mental illness and that he will probably need to live in a treatment home with psychological oversight. Abraham Gordon, a friend of Reuven's father, is a controversial figure; Gordon's books, which question the existence of God but seek to reconcile these questions with Jewish tradition, have caused him to be placed in cherem; Gordon keeps a scrapbook of the many times he has been attacked in the press. At Hirsch University, Reuven's Talmud teacher, Rav Kalman, is a rigidly religious Holocaust survivor who vehemently disapproves of Reuven's father's secular method of Talmudic study, which proposes that passages of Talmud contain scribal errors that can be deduced through critical reading of the relevant medieval commentaries and the study of variant readings. During Talmud class, Reuven and his fellow classmates listen to Rav Kalman's regular tirades about how the modern world is destroying Jewish life. One day, he directs one of his tirades at the Zecharias Frankel Seminary, where Abraham Gordon serves as a professor. He later tells Reuven that he is not allowed to enter the Zechariah Frankel Seminary; Reuven had been seen there checking variant readings for his father's book on the critical method. That fall, Reuven and Rachel agree that they are merely good friends (not romantic partners), and Michael is sent to live in the treatment center that Danny is doing his residency in. Danny meets Rachel when a treatment plan for Michael is being developed and they begin dating. Meanwhile, Reuven's father's book is published, which further infuriates Rav Kalman. He writes an extensive article criticizing the book's method of Talmud study after first enlisting Reuven's help in understanding the method, which infuriates Reuven. The clash between orthodoxy and modernity creates tension at the school where Reuven's father teaches, as the school's new faculty members (many of whom are Holocaust survivors) vehemently disagree with Reuven's father's ideas. As a result of Michael's worsening condition, Danny comes up with an idea for an experiment; to completely isolate Michael in a silent room with no contact with the outside world. Abraham and Ruth (Michael's mother) Gordon agree to Danny's experiment and it begins, much to Michael's chagrin. As Reuven's rabbinic ordination (smicha) examinations approach, Rav Kalman tells Reuven that he must make a choice: to use his father's method and fail, or to use the traditional method of Talmud study and become a rabbi. At the same time, word leaks out that there will be a new department in the university that will teach Talmud in a secular manner, which infuriates Rav Kalman. Reuven's father informs Reuven that he may be offered a position in the planned rabbinics department. As the months pass, Michael descends into silent catatonia, which sends panic through Reuven, the Gordon family, and Danny (whose career hinges on the experiment). Eventually, Reuven takes his smicha examinations. Deciding to be true to himself, Reuven uses his father's method of emending the text of the Talmud in order to clarify more complicated passages. This surprises even the dean and the more progressive Rav Gershenson (who was Reuven's teacher in The Chosen), yet the two men are impressed with Reuven's knowledge and creativity. On the other hand, Rav Kalman appears to be angered and annoyed. In the end, Rav Kalman gives Reuven smicha, stating that although he vehemently disagrees with his methods, he can hear the love of Jewish text in his voice, something he had not heard since his students were killed in the Holocaust. As a compromise between the school and Rav Kalman, Reuven's father's cannot teach in the rabbinics department at Hirsch, yet Reuven is given a post in the department, where he will be allowed to use the critical method, and where Rav Kalman promises to fight with him about it. Reuven's father instead accepts a post at the Zechariah Frankel Seminary. At Reuven's graduation ceremony Rav Kalman and Reuven's father politely shake hands and Rav Kalman tells him that he has never had a student with more audacity as Reuven, yet he has also never had a student with more kindness. After months of confinement, Michael finally talks when Reuven visits and mentions that Rav Kalman is giving him smicha -- the same Rav Kalman who had attacked Reuven's father in the press. Michael reveals that his anger and other problems stem from the fact that his father is an outspoken secular rabbi who is hated and attacked, which made Michael feel alienated and uncomfortable; he hates his father and his mother, and yet, he also loves them, and fears that his hate will hurt them irreparably. Michael secretly wished the elder Malter's work would prevent Reuven from receiving smicha, and therefore, Reuven would hate his father, and have something in common with Michael. Having expressed his true feelings, he embraces his parents and is now ready to begin traditional therapy with Danny. Rachel and Danny marry, and at the wedding, Danny tells Reuven that he will write his doctoral dissertation on his experiment with Michael. The novel ends where it starts, with the Malters and Gordons on vacation in the Catskills. Themes and analysis The central theme of the novel is Reuven's conflict between the traditional teachings of men like Rav Kalman and modern approaches endorsed by men like his father and Abraham Gordon. In the end, Reuven chooses to take from both schools of thought and find a balance. He chooses to embrace modernity by using his father's method on the Talmud, and possibly on the Prophets and Writings section of the Bible, but not on the Pentateuch. In doing this, he embraces his intelligence, but also the promise he made to his Jewish faith. Reuven attends the Samson Rafael Hirsch college and seminary; Samson Rafael Hirsch was the intellectual founder of the Modern Orthodox movement. The other major school in the novel is the Zechariah Frankel Seminary; Zechariah Frankel was the intellectual founder of the modern conservative movement. The leader of the Frankel seminary is Abraham Gordon, whose name is very similar to that of Abraham Geiger, the intellectual founder of the modern reform movement. This is presumably intentional, as the book is centered around the struggle between the different denominations. References Category:1969 American novels Category:Alfred A.

In 1936, she received an honorary degree in Doctor of Letters from Oglethorpe University. She married Cecil Barnes in 1910, and had three sons, Cecil Jr., Edward Larrabee and Benjamin Ayer. In 1920, Barnes was elected alumnae director of Bryn Mawr and served three years. As director, she helped to organize the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, which offered an alternative educational program for women workers within a traditional institution. Consisting mainly of young, single immigrant women with little to no academic background, the summer program offered courses in progressive education, liberal arts and economics. Women in the program were encouraged to develop confidence as speakers, writers and leaders in the workplace.Margaret Ayer Barnes Collection at Bryn Mawr Library In 1926, at age 40, she broke her back in a traffic accident, and, with the encouragement of friend and playwright Edward Sheldon, took up writing as a way to occupy her time. Between 1926 and 1930 she wrote several short stories and three plays, including an adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel The Age of Innocence. In 1931 she won the Pulitzer Prize for her first novel, Years of Grace. A 1936 lawsuit against Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer for copyright infringement claimed that the script MGM used for the motion picture Letty Lynton (1932) plagiarized material from the play Dishonored Lady by Edward Sheldon and Barnes. The film is still unavailable today because of this lawsuit. Personal life Barnes grew up the youngest of four siblings in Chicago, Illinois. As a child, Barnes had a keen interest in theater and reading. She befriended Edward Sheldon, the playwright who would encourage her to become a writer many years later. Barnes was the wife of a prominent Chicago attorney, Cecil Barnes, with whom she had three children.

Additionally, North Allegheny School District received $147,087 in Accountability Block Grant funding to focus on academic achievement and level funding for special education services. Among the public school districts in Allegheny County, South Fayette Township School District received the highest percentage increase in BEF at 5.5%. The district has the option of applying for several other state and federal grants to increase revenues. The Commonwealth's budget increased Basic Education Funding statewide by $123 million to over $5.5 billion. Most of Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts received an increase of Basic Education Funding in a range of 0.9% to 4%. Eight public school districts received exceptionally high funding increases of 10% to 16%. The highest increase in state funding was awarded to Austin Area School District which received a 22.5% increase in Basic Education Funding.Democrat Appropriations Committee, Report on Education funding by LEA, July 2, 2013 The highest percent of state spending per student is in the Chester-Upland district, where roughly 78 percent comes from state coffers. In Philadelphia, it is nearly 49 percent. As a part of the education budget, the state provided the PSERS (Pennsylvania school employee pension fund) with $1,017,000,000 and Social Security payments for school employees of $495 million.Pennsylvania Office of the Budget, 2013-14 State Budget Highlights, 2013 For the 2012-13 school year, North Allegheny School District received $8,615,699. The Governor's Executive Budget for 2012-2013 includes $9.34 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade public education, including $5.4 billion in basic education funding, which is an increase of $49 million over the 2011-12 budget. The state also provides $100 million for the Accountability Block grant. North Allegheny School District received $147,087 in Accountability Block Grant funding to focus on academic achievement. The state provided $544.4 million for School Employees‚Äô Social Security and $856 million for School Employees‚Äô Retirement fund called PSERS. This amount is a $21,823,000 increase (0.34%) over the 2011-2012 appropriations for Basic Education Funding, School Employees' Social Security, Pupil Transportation, Nonpublic and Charter School Pupil Transportation. Since taking office, Corbett's first two budgets have restored more than $918 million in support of public schools, compensating for the $1 billion in federal stimulus dollars lost at the end of the 2010-11 school year. In 2011-12, North Allegheny School District received a $8,468,612 allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the North Allegheny School District received $147,087 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In the 2010-11 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2% increase in Basic Education Funding (BEF) for a total of $8,810,745 to North Allegheny School District. Among Allegheny County's 43 public school districts, the highest increase went to South Fayette Township School District an 11.32% increase in BEF. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others. In the 2009‚Äì10 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2% increase in Basic Education Funding to North Allegheny School District, for a total of $8,637,984. This was the lowest percentage point increase, in Basic Education Funding, for the school districts in Allegheny County and in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Four Allegheny County public school districts received increases of over 6% in Basic Education Funding in 2009‚Äì10. Chartiers Valley School District received an 8.17% increase. In Pennsylvania, over 15 school districts received Basic Education Funding increases in excess of 10% in 2009. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received the highest with a 22.31% increase in funding. The amount of increase each school district received was determined by Governor Edward G. Rendell and the Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak through the allocation made in the budget proposal made in February each year.Pennsylvania Budget Proposal 2010, Office of Budget, February 2010 The state Basic Education Funding to the North Allegheny School District in 2008-09 was $8,468,612.46.Pennsylvania Department of Education Report on Funding by school district October 2009 According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 243 district students received free or reduced- price lunches due to low family income in the 2007‚Äì2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Funding Report by LEA, 2009 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Pennsylvania spent $7,824 Per Pupil in the year 2000.

Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, North Allegheny School District applied for and received $399,231 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to implement Research-Based Improvement Strategies for the 7th year. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. North Allegheny School District did not apply to participate in the grant program in 2006-07. In 2007-08 the district received $427,158. The district received $77,938 in 2008-09 for a total funding of $505,096 In Allegheny County, the highest award $835,286 was given to Highlands School District. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis. Safe Schools Grant In 2014, North Allegheny School District received a Safe Schools Initiative Targeted Grant of $25,000, which was used to offset costs for ongoing security upgrades at its 14 buildings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, North Allegheny School District is one of 110 public school districts and public charter schools sharing $2.6 million in competitive grants, to be used to prevent and reduce violence. The district has completed a $368,845 safety upgrade project which included videophones for building-access. Other grants The North Allegheny School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants, PA Science Its Elementary grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell), Education Assistance Grants, 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, 2012 and 2013 nor Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants, nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. Federal Stimulus grant North Allegheny School District received $2,132,150 in ARRA ‚Äì Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students.Allegheny County ARRA FUNDING Report Website. Accessed April 2010. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant North Allegheny School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. Real estate taxes Property tax rates in 2013-14 were set by the school board at 17.4039 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2012-13 - 20.9230 mills. *2011-12 - 20.2600 mills. *2010-11 - 19.7400 mills *2009-10 - 18.9900 mills. *2008-09 - 18.9900 mills. *2007-08 - 19.3400 mills. *2006-07 - 19.7220 mills. *2005-06 - 18.5220 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Allegheny County residents amounts to about 4.09% of their yearly income. Allegheny County ranked 209th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2013 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

For the school budget year 2013-14, 311 Pennsylvania public school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index. Another 171 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 89 school districts received approval to exceed the Index in full while others received a partial approval of their request. For special education costs, 75 districts received approval to exceed their tax limit. For the pension costs exception, 169 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. Eleven Pennsylvania public school districts received an approval for grandfathered construction debts.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2013-2014, April 2013 For the 2012-13 budget year, North Allegheny School Board applied for 2 exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: special education costs and pension costs. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, the North Allegheny School Board applied for three exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: Maintenance of Selected Revenue, special education costs and teacher pension costs. Each year, the North Allegheny School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. North Allegheny School Board apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011 due to escalating teacher pension costs. For 2009-10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.

Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Beaver County, 62% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, 2-23-2010. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Extracurriculars The North Allegheny School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.Home-Schooled, Charter School Children Can Participate in School District Extracurricular Activities, Pennsylvania Office of the Governor Press Release, November 10, 2005 Athletics, Facilities, and Activities The school district offers 24 varsity sports. During the 2004‚Äì2005 school year, nine of these sports took WPIAL titles, 18 took section titles, one took a PIAA title.

AirStation residential gateways incorporated a button on the unit to let the user initiate this procedure. AOSS was designed to use the maximum level of security available to both connecting devices including both Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). Connection Process # Association Phase: Once AOSS has been initiated on both devices via the AOSS button, the access point will change its SSID to \\"ESSID-AOSS\\" and the client will attempt to connect to it. Both devices will attempt connection for two minutes. Connection will be made using a secret 64-bit WEP key known to both devices. # Key Generation Phase: With both devices connected, the AP generates and transfers a unique key to the client where an RC4 tunnel is created. The AP creates four SSIDs and encryption keys for AES, TKIP, WEP128, and WEP64 generated from a random key script. These keys are available in the user interface of the AOSS AP to be used with non-AOSS clients. # Information Exchange Phase: The client notifies the AP of its encryption support. # Key Transfer Phase: All four encryption keys are transmitted to the client regardless of encryption support allowing the client to change the SSID if needed. The user does not have access to the keys through the client device. # Reboot Stack: The AP applies the SSID and key for the highest level of encryption supported by the client and reboots. The previously used WEP64 and RC4 tunnel are no longer used. The client adapter will automatically reboot or re-initialize and connect to the SSID using the proper encryption key. If a subsequent AOSS process connects with a lesser wireless encryption standard, the AP will apply the lesser standard and the Reboot Stack phase will be repeated for all connected devices.

The method was introduced by George E. P. Box and K. B. Wilson in 1951. The main idea of RSM is to use a sequence of designed experiments to obtain an optimal response. Box and Wilson suggest using a second-degree polynomial model to do this. They acknowledge that this model is only an approximation, but they use it because such a model is easy to estimate and apply, even when little is known about the process. Statistical approaches such as RSM can be employed to maximize the production of a special substance by optimization of operational factors. Of late, for formulation optimization, the RSM, using proper design of experiments (DoE), has become extensively used. In contrast to conventional methods, the interaction among process variables can be determined by statistical techniques. Basic approach of response surface methodology An easy way to estimate a first- degree polynomial model is to use a factorial experiment or a fractional factorial design. This is sufficient to determine which explanatory variables affect the response variable(s) of interest. Once it is suspected that only significant explanatory variables are left, then a more complicated design, such as a central composite design can be implemented to estimate a second- degree polynomial model, which is still only an approximation at best. However, the second-degree model can be used to optimize (maximize, minimize, or attain a specific target for) the response variable(s) of interest. Important RSM properties and features ORTHOGONALITY: The property that allows individual effects of the k-factors to be estimated independently without (or with minimal) confounding. Also orthogonality provides minimum variance estimates of the model coefficient so that they are uncorrelated. ROTATABILITY: The property of rotating points of the design about the center of the factor space. The moments of the distribution of the design points are constant. UNIFORMITY: A third property of CCD designs used to control the number of center points is uniform precision (or Uniformity). Special geometries Cube Cubic designs are discussed by Kiefer, by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias and by Hardin and Sloane. Sphere Spherical designs are discussed by Kiefer and by Hardin and Sloane. Simplex geometry and mixture experiments Mixture experiments are discussed in many books on the design of experiments, and in the response-surface methodology textbooks of Box and Draper and of Atkinson, Donev and Tobias. An extensive discussion and survey appears in the advanced textbook by John Cornell. Extensions Multiple objective functions Some extensions of response surface methodology deal with the multiple response problem. Multiple response variables create difficulty because what is optimal for one response may not be optimal for other responses. Other extensions are used to reduce variability in a single response while targeting a specific value, or attaining a near maximum or minimum while preventing variability in that response from getting too large. Practical concerns Response surface methodology uses statistical models, and therefore practitioners need to be aware that even the best statistical model is an approximation to reality. In practice, both the models and the parameter values are unknown, and subject to uncertainty on top of ignorance. Of course, an estimated optimum point need not be optimum in reality, because of the errors of the estimates and of the inadequacies of the model. Nonetheless, response surface methodology has an effective track-record of helping researchers improve products and services: For example, Box's original response-surface modeling enabled chemical engineers to improve a process that had been stuck at a saddle-point for years. The engineers had not been able to afford to fit a cubic three-level design to estimate a quadratic model, and their biased linear-models estimated the gradient to be zero. Box's design reduced the costs of experimentation so that a quadratic model could be fit, which led to a (long-sought) ascent direction.Improving Almost Anything: Ideas and Essays, Revised Edition (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics) George E.

Overview In comparative cultural studies, selected tenets of comparative literature are merged with selected tenets of the field of cultural studies (including culture theories, (radical) constructivism, communication theories, and systems theories) with the objective to study culture and culture products (including but not restricted to literature, communication, media, art, etc.). This is performed in a contextual and relational construction and with a plurality of methods and approaches, interdisciplinary, and, if and when required, including teamwork. In comparative cultural studies, it is the processes of communicative action(s) in culture and the how of these processes that constitute the main objectives of research and study. However, scholarship in comparative cultural studies does not exclude textual analysis proper of other established fields of study. In comparative cultural studies, ideally, the framework of and methodologies available in the systemic and empirical study of culture are favored. Scholarship in comparative cultural studies includes the theoretical, as well as methodological and applied postulate to move and to dialogue between cultures, languages, literature, and disciplines: attention to other cultures against essentialist notions and practices and beyond the paradigm of the nation-state is a basic and founding element of the framework and its application.

In the story, the young Prince Dolor, whose legs are paralysed due to a childhood trauma, is exiled to a tower in a wasteland. As he grows older, a fairy godmother provides a magical travelling cloak so he can see, but not touch, the world. He uses this cloak to go on various adventures, and develops great wisdom and empathy in the process. Finally he becomes a wise and compassionate ruler of his own land. The author's style was to stimulate positive feelings in her young readers so that they would be motivated to adopt socially correct actions in whatever circumstances they encountered. She shows how imagination (mediated by the cloak) can lead to empathy and enlightened morality. However, some critics have found a deeper theme in this story, relating to the restricted lives of respectable middle-class British Victorian women that enforced helplessness. Plot On the day of Prince Dolor's baptism, there was a great procession. His well-to-do nurse was fiddling with her dress while holding the Prince and she dropped him, causing damage to his spine (probably). But she told no one. A fairy godmother appears to the Nurse and reveals she knows what happened. The Prince's Mother (the Queen) dies. The Prince's legs never grow strong. He cannot walk; he can only crawl with his arms. The King dies, too. The Regent family moves into the castle (with many kids) and the Prince's Uncle rules the kingdom. Things are good throughout the land, but Prince Dolor is ignored. The new King sends Dolor away and tells everyone that Dolor died. Dolor is sent away to live in the lonely tower in the middle of a wasteland. There are no doors in the tower. It is 100 ft tall. But he has many books, toys and maps. His only companion is his nurse. And a deaf mute Black Knight brings them food and things. The Nurse is a 'prisoner', too. They use a ladder to get up into the tower. The Black Knight visits once a month. The Prince likes to be quiet and look out the window at the lonely plains. He does his lessons and schoolwork. He loves books. He learns of the kingdom of Nomansland. But he feels that to read of things and never see them is sad. If only he could fly he wished. And he wishes he had someone who would be nice to him. He was lonely. An old grey woman appears. She says I am your fairy godmother. Dolor asks, \\"Will you bring me a boy to play with?\\" She says no. But gives him a gift: A travelling cloak. When the nurse comes into the room to see who he was talking to, she disappears. The cloak looks like a poncho. He didn't know the magic powers it holds. One day he gets sick and his fairy godmother comes to visit. He asks her why he can't walk. She tells him he will never walk. He is sad. She asks where is your cloak? He had put it in the closet. She teaches him how to use it with the magic words and reminds him to open the skylight. When he says the magic words it grows bigger. At first he forgets the words that make it fly. And he forgets to open the skylight. When he was finally out flying around the tower, he felt wonderful. But he saw only dreary planes, the stars and moon. He got very cold. But he forgot the magic words that would take him home. The cloak took him faster and faster away from the tower. He became frightened. He calls out for his fairy godmother to please, please remind him of the magic words to bring him home. And he hears a voice tell him the word. When he gets home, he puts the cloak away and it shrinks and bundles itself up. The nurse didn't know he was gone, but is cross with him for leaving the skylight open. Its freezing in here! When Prince Dolor went to bed that night he couldn't wait to go out flying again tomorrow. The next day, he did his lessons and schoolwork quickly and went out on the cloak again. He saw all kinds of flowers and trees and grass, birds and small animals that scurried away from him. He wished he could see better and his godmother sent him some spectacles. He plays with his toys the next day and thinks about his toy horse and wishes he had a real horse. That night when he went out, he brought with him some food and water and a coat and he flew for a long time. He fell asleep while flying. When he awoke he was no longer in the wasteland. He was in the countryside. He saw rivers and hills, animals, trees, and even a waterfall. He wished he could hear everything better and his godmother sent him some silver ears that fit over his own. He wondered if he would see any people. He wished so much to have a little boy to play with. His flying cloak dipped lower and brought him closer to see a boy running in the field with his horse. As he watched, the little prince cried because he knew that he himself would never be able to run that way. Then a lark flew into his lap and he was happy again because this was such a strange and wonderful thing. He wondered about his mother and father. He wondered what happened to them. The lark stayed with him and lived right outside his skylight. He decided after seeing the running boy that he didn't want to fly around any more because it made him sad. A few months later he wondered if he will ever be the king as princes are supposed to. His nurse wrote on a paper \\"You ARE a king‚Äù and she finally wrote out his whole history for him. She was afraid to speak in case a spy heard her break the rule about not telling him. That night he used the cloak and asked it to show him not what he wanted to see but ‚Äúwhat I SHOULD see.‚Äù The flying cloak took him to see the big city of Nomansland. A magpie came to fly next to him and spoke to him with a strangely familiar voice. The magpie shows him the palace ‚Äì the biggest building he ever saw and showed him the regent King, his uncle ‚Äì who had just died and was lying there looking like a wax figure. The bird showed him that the town was beginning to revolt. There was a revolution going on. He saw terrible fighting in the streets. He didn't want to see any more and he went home to his tower to sleep. When he woke up re realised his nurse was gone. He sees hoof prints outside his tower. He realises that the Black Knight came and got the nurse and took her away. He is alone in the tower for many days. He almost runs out of food and is very sad and lonely when one morning he hears a trumpet. A huge parade of people from the city had come to his tower. They were singing and celebrating for they had heard that he was alive. The nurse and the black night rode to the city to tell them about Prince Dolor. He was crowned the new king. He rules the city for many years. When he gets old, he tells the people of the kingdom that he will leave and never come back. He gets on his cloak (which no one ever saw before) and flies away.

Marini was born in Brescia. He may have studied with his uncle Giacinto Bondioli. His works were printed and influential throughout the European musical world. He traveled throughout his life, and occupied posts in Brussels, over thirty years in Neuburg an der Donau and D√ºsseldorf, and Venice in 1615, joining Monteverdi's group at St. Mark's Cathedral, Padua, Parma, Ferrara, Milan, Bergamo, and Brescia in Italy. There is evidence that he married three times and fathered five children. He died in Venice. Although he wrote both instrumental and vocal music, he is better known for his innovative instrumental compositions. He contributed to the early development of the string idiom by expanding the performance range of the solo and accompanied violin and incorporating slur, double and even triple stopping, and the first explicitly notated tremolo (in the sonata La Foscarina, op. 1 No. 14; 1617) effects into his music. He was also among the first composers, after Marco Uccellini, to call for scordatura tunings. He made contributions to most of the contemporary genres and investigated unusual compositional procedures, like constructing an entire sonata without a cadence (as in his Sonata senza cadenza). At least some, and perhaps a great deal, of his output is lost, but that which survives exhibits his inventiveness, lyrical skill, harmonic boldness, and growing tendency toward common practice tonality. In addition to his violin works, he wrote music for the cornett, dulcian, and sackbut. One latter-day champion of Marini's music is the British violinist Andrew Manze, who has released a disc on the Harmonia Mundi label entitled Curiose e moderne inventioni devoted to Marini's music for strings.

Early life and accounts An accused \\"witch\\" during the witch trials in the late 17th century The trial of Ann Glover cannot be found in official records perhaps because it occurred during the brief and controversial Dominion of New England under the royally appointed governor Edmund Andros. Transactions of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts (Dec. 1904) p 21 https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=c8_kAAAAMAAJ&pg;=GBS.PA21 \\"Rather curiously the last case [Ann Glover] does not appear in the Records of the Court of Assistants, 1673 to 1692, nor is it in the Massachusetts Colony Records.\\" There are four primary contemporary sources for the accusations against Glover and her execution. *1 - Cotton Mather's Memorable Providences (1689)https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=cmxjAAAAcAAJ&pg;=GBS.PA131. Also reprinted with very slight changes in Magnalia Christi Americana (1702). Mather's book is the most extensive treatment of the trial and includes a \\"Notandum\\" at the end written after the execution of Glover and Mather reports that the children Glover had supposedly bewitched continued to suffer \\"renewal of their afflictions.\\" But Mather concludes that the meaning of this is \\"not to disappoint our expectations of their deliverance, but for the detection and destruction of more belonging to that hellish knot.\\" *2 - The diary of Judge Samuel Sewall is important as the only source that dates her execution and lists some of the persons involved::, acting under the Dominion government. \\"The widow Glover is drawn by to be hanged.

There are numerous sources that considerably post-date events and thus are likely to include a great deal of speculation, including Fr. James Fitton's account in 1872, Rev. Sherwood Healy (1876), Bernard Corr (1891), and Harold Dijon (1905), George Francis O'Dwyer (1921), Michael O'Brien (1937), John Henry Cutler (1962), Rev. Vincent A. Lapomarda (1989‚Äì90), Margaret E. Fitzgerald and Joseph A. King (1990), White Cargo (2008), Alan Titley (2011‚Äì14), Prof. Robert Allison of Suffolk University, Boston (2014), all added various fictions to her biography . All that can be said of her early life is that she was born in Ireland, apparently transported to Barbados after the Cromwell's invasion of Ireland. Life in Boston By 1680, Ann and her daughter Mary were living in Boston ‚Äî at the time, part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony ‚Äî where they worked as housekeepers for John Goodwin. In the summer of 1688, Martha Goodwin (age 13) accused Ann Glover's daughter of stealing laundry. This caused Ann to have a fierce argument with Martha and the Goodwin children, which then supposedly caused them to become ill and to start acting strangely. The doctor who was called suggested it was caused by witchcraft, because he could not offer another diagnosis or heal the children. Martha and the other children seemed to be \\"bewitched\\" The Genealogical Dictionary of New England (ed. James Savage). Glover was arrested and tried for witchcraft. Her answers could not be understood, and for a time her accusers thought she was speaking a language of the devil, but it became clear that this was not the case. In the words of her leading accuser, the Reverend Cotton Mather, \\"the court could have no answer from her but in the Irish which was her native language...\\" (Memorable Providence, 1689). By that time she had apparently lost the ability to speak English, though she could still understand it. An interpreter was found for her and the trial proceeded. Cotton Mather wrote that Glover was \\"a scandalous old Irishwoman, very poor, a Roman Catholic and obstinate in idolatry.\\"Magnalia Christi Americana, Cotton Mather, 1702. At her trial it was demanded of her to say the Lord's Prayer. She recited it in Irish and broken Latin, but was unable to say it in English.Historical Records and Studies, Volume 17, pp. 70-78. There was a belief that an inability to recite the Lord's prayer was the mark of a witch. Her house was searched and \\"small images\\" or doll-like figures were found. When Mather was interrogating her she supposedly said that she prayed to a host of spirits and Mather took this to mean that these spirits were demons. Many of the accusations against Ann used spectral evidence, which cannot be proven. Cotton Mather visited Glover in prison where he said that she supposedly engaged in night-time trysts with the devil and other evil spirits. It was considered that Ann might not be of sound mind and could possibly be mentally ill. Five of the six physicians who examined her found her to be competent. She was therefore pronounced guilty and put to death by hanging. On November 16, 1688, Glover was hanged in Boston amid mocking shouts from the crowd.History of the United States, Volume II, Bancroft, p. 52. When she was taken out to be hanged she said that her death would not relieve the children of their malady. There are several testaments as to her final words. According to some she said that the children would keep suffering because she was not the only witch to have afflicted them, but when asked to name the other witches, she refused. Another account says that Glover said that killing her would be useless because it was someone else who had bewitched the children. Either way, Ann Glover did believe in witches. A Boston merchant who knew her, Robert Calef, said that \\"Goody Glover was a despised, crazy, poor old woman, an Irish Catholic who was tried for afflicting the Goodwin children. Her behavior at her trial was like that of one distracted. They did her cruel. The proof against her was wholly deficient. The jury brought her guilty. She was hung. She died a Catholic.\\"More Wonders of the Invisible World, London, 1700. The evidence adduced against her is open to question. When Glover told Mather that she prayed to a host of spirits she may have been talking about Catholic saints. The dolls she had in her possession and which were believed to have been used for witchcraft might actually have been crude representations of Catholic saints. The majority of the population at that time and place was Puritan, and there was Puritan prejudice against Catholics. One contemporary writer recorded that, \\"There was a great concourse of people to see if the Papist would relent, her one cat was there, fearsome to see. They would to destroy the cat, but Mr. Calef would not permit it. Before her executioners she was bold and impudent, making to forgive her accusers and those who put her off. She predicted that her death would not relieve the children saying that it was not she that afflicted them.\\" Ann's daughter Mary reportedly suffered a mental break from the strain of her mother's trial: \\"her mind gave way under the strain,\\" and she ended her days \\"a raving maniac.\\" She was likely the same \\"Mary Glover the Irish Catholic Witch\\" who was imprisoned in Boston alongside convicted pirates Thomas Hawkins, Thomas Pound, and William Coward (whose trial shared some of the same judges as Ann Glover's, and who were also ministered to by Cotton Mather) in late 1689. Legacy Three hundred years later in 1988, the Boston City Council proclaimed November 16 as Goody Glover Day. She is the only victim of the witchcraft hysteria in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to receive such a tribute. Glover's accusations and death occurred before the better known Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts and her trial would become the basis for many of the cases in the 1692 Salem witch trials. It has sometimes been asserted that Glover was an Irish slave (see Irish slaves myth). However, after reviewing the evidence, Liam Hogan, a librarian from Limerickhttps://hcommons.org/members/liamhogan/ has stated that > while this \\"Irish slave\\" narrative has been presented to thousands of > contemporary readers as historical fact, it was only added to Glover's story > centuries after her death, first as speculation and later as absolute > certainty.

Wheatley was born at Low Fell, Gateshead, County Durham. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.Wisden 1959, p. 291. A tall, fair-haired right-arm fast-medium bowler, he came to prominence for Cambridge University in 1958 when he set the record for the most wickets in the university's abbreviated season with 80 first-class wickets for under 18 each.Wynne-Thomas, Peter; The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records; p. 45; He played in the university holidays for Warwickshire with very limited success but in 1959 joined that county full-time, taking 100 wickets in the season though at a rather high cost. He repeated the feat in 1960, but at the end of the season was allowed to leave for Glamorgan, where he was appointed captain in place of Wilf Wooller, who had led the county since 1947. Wheatley formed a hostile new ball partnership with the Test bowler Jeff Jones for a few seasons and in six years as captain took more than 600 wickets at an average of less than 20 runs per wicket.CricketArchive Season by Season Bowling Stats He retired from the captaincy at the end of the 1966 season, and played only a few matches in 1967. But in 1968 an early season injury to Jones meant that Wheatley returned to play in 16 County Championship matches, bowling with such success that he took 82 wickets at a cost of under 13 runs each and topped the national averages for the season.Wisden 1969, p. 276. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1969 edition of the almanack. Wheatley played only a few games in Glamorgan's Championship-winning season of 1969 and retired after one match on the celebratory tour of the West Indies the following winter. In all matches, he took 1,099 wickets at an average of under 21 runs per wicket. He was never allowed higher up the batting order than number ten (alternating in the last two places with Jones), and his career runs only just exceeded his wickets. His highest score in purely county cricket was only 21,First-Class Batting against each opponent though in a festival match in 1961 for the Gentlemen he hit 34 not out and put on 55 for the tenth wicket with Trevor Bailey.Gentlemen v Players at Scarborough, 1961 In retirement, Wheatley remained prominent in cricket administration both at county and national level. He acted as a Test selector for England and chaired Test and County Cricket Board committees, as well as being president of Glamorgan. He was appointed CBE in the 1997 New Year Honours.CricketArchive Profile References External links  Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:English cricketers Category:Sportspeople from Gateshead Category:People educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham Category:Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:Cambridge University cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:Glamorgan cricketers Category:Glamorgan cricket captains Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:England cricket team selectors Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Free Foresters cricketers Category:International Cavaliers cricketers Category:Gentlemen cricketers Category:Gentlemen of England cricketers Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Ossie Wheatley"},{"id":"4481309","text":"Sveta Petka (Sv.

It is close to the villages of Shocklach, Worthenbury and Malpas. Etymology, history Threapwood developed on an area of common land, historically a tract of woodland lying between Cheshire and Flintshire, which was traditionally reputed to have fallen outside of county, parish and township boundaries: it was therefore outside the jurisdiction of any Justice of the Peace and paid no land tax or parish rates. This status was reflected in its name, with threap being a common Old English place name element referring to disputed boundary areas.Winchester, W. Discovering Parish Boundaries, Shire, 2000, p.42 This vague administrative status was to lead to Threapwood gaining a reputation as a home to \\"abandoned characters of every description, and especially of women of loose or blemished morals\\".GENUKI : Flintshire, Threapwood, St. John It was also a refuge for military deserters.See Pickering, D. Statutes at Large from the 26th to the 30th year of King George III, Cambridge: Charles Bathurst, 1766, p.329 Various attempts were made to bring Threapwood within the normal administrative structure; by the Militia Acts of 1792 it was decreed to be in Worthenbury - though for the purposes of the militia only - and the Mutiny Act 1797 placed it in the parish of Malpas.Cathrall, W.

His parents were Protestant missionaries. Nelson studied at Wheaton College and later at the Juilliard School of Music with Jean Morel. Nelson was music director of the Greenwich Philharmonia and the New Jersey Pro Arte, and also served on the conducting staff of the Metropolitan Opera. In 1973, he conducted his New York City opera debut at Carnegie Hall in an uncut performance of Berlioz's Les Troyens. With the Metropolitan Opera, his professional opera conducting debut was also with Les Troyens, on one day's notice as an emergency substitute for Rafael Kubel√≠k. Nelson was music director of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra from 1976 to 1987, making commercial recordings there of music by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich and Charles Martin Loeffler for New World Records. With Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, he was music director from 1985 to 1988, and principal conductor from 1988 to 1991. He was also music director of the Caramoor Festival in Katonah, New York, from 1983 to 1990. In 1998, Nelson became music director of the Ensemble Orchestral de Paris (now renamed the Orchestre de chambre de Paris), a position he retained for ten years. Nelson's interest in choral music led to his position as artistic director of Soli Deo Gloria. Nelson and his wife Anita had two daughters, Kari, and Kirsten. Anita Nelson died in October 2012.

Preparation and properties  It can be prepared by homolysis of triphenylmethyl chloride 1 by a metal like silver or zinc in benzene or diethyl ether. The radical 2 forms a chemical equilibrium with the quinoid- type dimer 3 (Gomberg's dimer). In benzene the concentration of the radical is 2%. Triphenylmethyl radical Solutions containing the radical are yellow; when the temperature of the solution is raised, the yellow color becomes more intense as the equilibrium is shifted in favor of the radical (in accordance with Le Ch√¢telier's principle). When exposed to air, the radical rapidly oxidizes to the peroxide, and the color of the solution changes from yellow to colorless. Likewise, the radical reacts with iodine to triphenylmethyl iodide. Triphenylmethyl radical oxidationWhile the trityl radical forms a quinoid dimer, derivatives thereof with the appropriate substitution pattern do form dimers with a hexaphenylethane structure. X-ray studies give a bond length of 1.67 √Ö for hexakis(3,5-di-t-butylphenyl)ethane. Theoretical calculations on a very high level of theory indicate that van der Waals attraction between the tert-butyl groups create a potential minimum that is absent in the unsubstituted molecule. Other derivatives have been reported as the quinoid dimer  History  The radical was discovered by Moses Gomberg in 1900 at the University of Michigan. (Note: radical is also called a cadicle.) He tried to prepare hexaphenylethane from triphenylmethyl chloride and zinc in benzene in a Wurtz reaction and found that the product, based on its behaviour towards iodine and oxygen, was far more reactive than anticipated. The discovered structure was used in the development of ESR spectroscopy and confirmed by it. The correct quinoid structure for the dimer was suggested as early as 1904 but this structure was soon after abandoned by the scientific community in favor of hexaphenylethane (4). It subsequently took until 1968 for its rediscovery when researchers at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam published proton NMR data.

Life Pescetti was born in Venice and studied there under the organist and opera composer Antonio Lotti. From 1725 to 1732 he wrote operas for various theatres in Venice, he left for London in 1736, replacing Porpora as director of the Opera of the Nobility in 1737 . He probably left London around 1745 when hostility against Catholic Italians arose because of the Jacobite rebellion of Prince Charles and the Highland clans. He returned to Venice in 1747 and in 1762 was appointed second organist at St Mark's Basilica . He died in Venice. Pescetti was active as a teacher of composition in Venice; his most famous students being Josef Mysliveƒçek (1737‚Äì1781) and Antonio Salieri (1750‚Äì1825). Although his output consists mainly of operatic works, a considerable amount of Pescetti's compositions were written for harpsichord, some intended to be performed on pipe organ, including his Six Sonatas, composed around 1756. Today, his keyboard sonatas are generally performed on a modern piano, though various recordings exist that use the intended organ. Sonata in C minor The Sonata in C minor was transcribed for harp by Carlos Salzedo. The first movement is in and opens with eighth notes outlining the tonic triad‚ÄîC, down a fourth to G, up a sixth to E Flat and back down a third to C. This is echoed in the left hand as the right hand plays quarter notes E-flat, C, B-natural. The right hand now plays the melody again and continues on, transposing to G major, going through a short development and then ending in G. The melody repeats, then goes to a second section starting in E-flat major. This section follows the same structure‚Äîmelody in right hand, melody in left hand, melody in right hand, transposes back to C minor, goes through the same development and then ends in C minor. The second section repeats again and the movement ends. The second movement in characterized by a quarter note melody embellished by grace notes with a triplet left-hand accompaniment. The third movement (presto) begins with the three notes of the C minor triad in a C‚ÄìG‚ÄìC‚ÄìE-flat pattern. This upwards moving passage then moves down from E-flat to C then repeats the opening pattern with different notes, D‚ÄìG‚ÄìD‚ÄìF and then descends from F to D and then returns to E flat. In order to complete this opening passage there is a downwards scale from E-flat to C and then leave the opening in a state of resolution, there is a final four note pattern, B-natural‚ÄìC‚ÄìD and finally to G, the dominant. This is then repeated an octave lower. Throughout this, the left hand is playing short, staccato accompanying quarter notes whereas the right, which was discussed above, is playing eighth note tuplet. After the opening passage is complete, there is a series of broken C major chords one octave above from where the opening passage ended. Each of these broken chords are repeated twice, modulating from C major to F minor to B-flat major and finally, to E flat major. Once reaching E-flat major, the relative major of C minor, there is a downwards scale continuing until reaching G, an octave lower. From this point, a new pattern emerges, consisting of the three notes: F, G, A-flat and B-flat. The notes are arranged in a G‚ÄìA-flat‚ÄìB-flat F‚ÄìG‚ÄìA-flat pattern, which is repeated twice. After this pattern, a broken E-flat major tonic chord is played, followed by another downwards scale once again beginning on C and continuing to a low F. Following the scale is a final closing pattern, one which is not heard in again in the piece. The closing bar ends with a broken E-flat major chord beginning on G followed by the three notes C, A-flat, G and closes with an E-flat major cadence. (End of first part.) Media Listen to an Allegretto in C major for harpsichord. Listen to the Allegro ma non presto, the first movement of the Sonata in C minor for harpsichord.

The game is a strategy contest that includes an element of chance which comes into play through various die rolls. Similar to Magic: The Gathering, each game represents a battle between very powerful individuals, in this case psychics called \\"Dream Lords.\\" These Dream Lords battle one another across the landscape of humanity's collective unconscious by spawning dream creatures out of human emotions, in particular Valor, Fear, Madness, and Passion. Dreamblade's restricted landscape and army-building rules (among other things) result in many aspects which are more similar to a collectible card game than a typical miniature game. In October 2007, Wizards of the Coast officially announced that they would no longer produce Dreamblade following the Night Fusion expansion set. Game play In a game of Dreamblade, two players engage in a duel. The game is won by the first player to gain six \\"victory points\\". A \\"victory point\\" is gained by the player with the most \\"conquest points\\" at the end of a turn, earned by controlling territories and destroying your opponent's creatures. Some abilities also grant \\"victory points\\". Each player begins with a warband composed of no more than 16 miniatures. In the course of the game these miniatures are put into play where they are used to accumulate conquest points towards winning the turn, and from there the game. There are two types of miniatures, creatures and locations. The miniatures, along with the playing area, and special six-sided attack dice comprise the unique elements of the game. Game elements Miniatures: The playing pieces of the game and the only element that is collectible. Each miniature will have a common, uncommon or rare designation. There are two types of miniatures, creatures and locations. *Creatures: The basic attributes of every creature include its spawn-cost, aspect-cost, power, defense, and life. Additionally most creatures belong to one of the aspects of Valor, Fear, Madness, or Passion (represented by the color of their base), and may also have a lineage and/or special abilities. Anvilborn miniatures have no aspect, though they may still have lineages. **Cost: A miniature's cost has two parts‚Äîspawn cost and aspect cost. ***Spawn Cost: The minimum amount of spawn points a player has to spend to spawn the miniature. At the beginning of each turn, each player rolls one die, and the total represents the number of spawn points available for that turn. ***Aspect Cost: Each miniature from the same aspect which is in play or in the graveyard counts as one point of the aspect cost, all remaining aspect-cost must be played using spawn points. **Power: The number of action dice the player rolls for the creature when it attacks. **Defense: The amount of damage it takes to disrupt a creature (remove it from its current space on the board). **Life: The amount of damage it takes to destroy a creature. *Locations: Locations have a spawn cost and an aspect cost (just like creatures), but no power, defense or life. They cannot move, but offer some special ability to the rest of the warband. *Aspects: Most miniatures belong to one of the four aspects of Valor, Fear, Madness, and Passion. The Anvilborn are mechanical in nature, and thus are not driven by the aspects (which are essentially 'feelings'). Each aspect has different qualities which are reflected as basic traits in the miniatures; for example creatures from the Madness aspect primarily have low Defense but high Life. *Lineages: Some miniatures belong to a lineage. Lineages are creatures spawned by a specific dream lord or a group of dream lords. There are six lineages: Bloodcut, Janus, Lost, Hellbred, Hiveling, and Stitched. *Abilities: The initial Dreamblade rulebook lists approximately 50 different miniature abilities. Blade abilities are the most common of these. **Blade Abilities: Blade abilities come in four types (blade, double blade, multiblade, and double multiblade), each representing the number of blades (a special symbol which may be rolled on the dice) which may be spent on the ability: one, two, unlimited, or an unlimited even number respectively. All rolled blades must be spent, which allows for the existence of blade abilities which have negative effects. **Spawn abilities: Spawn abilities are like blade abilities except that they are activated in the spawn phase by paying spawn points and sometimes may only be activated when in specific cells on the board. **Come into Play abilities: Come into play (CiP) abilities activate whenever the miniature is spawned, usually as an extra cost to playing the piece or as a special ability. **Drive abilities: Drive abilities are specific to Anvilborn creatures, from the third booster set. Each Anvilborn creature moves not by regular movement, but by being driven, which determines how it moves at the beginning of the Spawn phase. Playing area: The playing area is a five by five grid. Players start out on opposite corners of the grid (this is known as the player's portal). The back row is known as the spawning row, and the center 3√ó3 grid is known as the key cells. *Spawning Row: The row closest to a player is his or her Spawning Row; after the first round, a player may spawn creatures in a cell in his or her spawning row that both shares a column with another creature he or she controls and is unoccupied. *Key Cells: All of the cells within this 3√ó3 grid are worth conquest points to one or both of the players. The row closest to a player's spawning row is worth five, four or three conquest points to his opponent, starting with the cell corner adjacent to the player's portal. The center square of the middle row is worth two points to either player, while the other two cells are worth one point each. If a cell is contested (both players have creatures in the cell) then neither player receives any conquest points. Attack Dice: Attack dice are six-sided (see the attached picture). Two of their faces count as misses (diamonds), three of the faces count as damage, with a one-point, two point, and three point damage face. The final face is the dreamblade, which is used to power the special abilities of the miniatures in the game; unlike other games, these abilities are not optional ‚Äì any blades rolled on a turn must be used if possible. Tournament Play Tournament play was a large part of Dreamblade. Wizards of the Coast held Duelists' Convocation International-sanctioned Dreamblade tournaments all over the world. Formats Constructed - Each player brings their premade warband of miniatures to the event. A warband must have no more than 16 miniatures and players may not use more than 3 of the same miniature. Sealed Box - Players make a warband out of the miniatures they received from booster packs given out to each player as part of the tournament. If using three boosters, the warbands must have no more than 16 miniatures, as in constructed play. If using two boosters, the warbands must have no more than 12 miniatures, and once during the game at the start of the turn a player may take the miniatures in their graveyard and put them back in their reserves. (This is called the \\"refresh\\" rule.) Booster Draft - Players assemble in groups, ideally consisting of 4 players each. Each group is called a \\"pod\\". Within each pod, boosters are opened one at a time, and players draft a single miniature from that booster, before passing the remainder to the next player in turn. This format can be done with either two or three boosters, and the maximum warband size requirements and \\"refresh\\" rule for two-booster format are the same as with Sealed Box. Events Edge - These were events held at local stores, and offered promotional alternate-paint miniatures as prizes. 1K - These were larger tournaments where the total prize awarded was $1000. The 1st-place winner received $500, 2nd place received $300, and 3rd and 4th places received $100 each. 10K - These were much larger international events where the total prize awarded was $10,000. The 1st-place winner earned $2000. Championship - This event, which required qualification through earning enough points at other events, offered $50,000 in total prizes. The 1st-place winner earned $10,000. On August 19, 2007, at Gen Con, Ben Stoll won the only \\"Dream Series Championship\\" ever held.2007 Dreamblade Dream Series Championship Wizards of the Coast no longer supports these programs, though independent tournament organizers may still sanction non-premier Dreamblade tournaments.

Their sound has been described as \\"folk tinged\\" and \\"twee\\" though not \\"pansy\\" or \\"saccharine\\". MSTU were active from 2004 to 2008. They took their name from an episode of the Japanese TV series Monkey. History Nat Johnson and Kevin Gori established MSTU in 2003 after meeting at the University of Sheffield. In the band's first incarnation they both sang and played acoustic guitars, with Gori adding extra touches with instruments such as the recorder and glockenspiel. The band later expanded to include Catherine Tully on violin, Andy George on cello and Rob Dean on drums. Johnson became the main singer and songwriter. In February 2006, the band released its first album, The Bright Carvings, on the small independent record label Thee Sheffield Phonographic Corporation. The band had been featured a number of times in Sandman magazine. On 11 April 2006 the band appeared on Gideon Coe's BBC 6 Music morning radio show, and played two songs live in session. In May 2006, the band supported Richard Hawley on three dates of his UK tour. Later that year, the band supported The Long Blondes on five dates of their UK tour. In July 2006 MSTU released \\"Science\\" (b/w \\"Happiness & Florence\\") as a CD single, and on 7\\" vinyl (b/w \\"Happiness\\") also on Thee SPC. The band signed to Loose Records to release a second album, The Casket Letters, in August 2007. The band also released a single from the album, \\"Little Polveir\\", a song named after a racehorse which was an unlikely winner of the British Grand National. The band performed further live radio sessions, including an appearance on Radio 4's Loose Ends. The band appeared at several festivals in the UK, including Latitude, Green Man, Truck, Secret Garden Party and End of the Road. A download-only single, \\"Bloodline\\", was released in September 2007, backed with a cover of Jonathan Richman's \\"Ice Cream Man\\". The band performed these songs live on Marc Riley's 6 Music show. On 4 December 2007, the band announced via its official website that it would be taking an indefinite hiatus after touring. Monkey Swallows the Universe played their last show in Edinburgh on 11 February 2008. After the announcement of hiatus, Nat Johnson began a solo career and released the single \\"Dirty Rotten Soul\\" in 2008. In 2009, she and Kevin Gori formed Nat Johnson and the Figureheads, who released albums on Damaged Goods Records and Thee Sheffield Phonographic Corporation. Nat Johnson appeared on the David Rotheray album The Life of Birds on the track \\"Flying Lessons\\" and on the album Another Sleepless Night with Rory McVicar by Rory McVicar. She released solo singles \\"DOG\\" in May 2014 and \\"Not Now Horse\\" in September 2014. Her seven-song album Neighbour of the Year came out in November 2014. MTSU reformed for a one-off gig at Queens Social Club in Sheffield in March 2016 to mark the 10th anniversary of the release of their first album.

It was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in two series in 2000 and 2002, with subsequent reruns on BBC 7 (later BBC Radio 4 Extra) in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012. Acropolis Now follows the fictional adventures of historical Greek characters in Athens: Heraclitus, Aristophanes, Socrates, Plato, Xanthippe, and the Oracle. It is loosely narrated by a chorus, in the convention of Greek dramas (the Chorus was dispensed with in the second series). Aristophanes, in addition to being a playwright (all of his plays have the title \\"One of Our [Subject] Has An Enormous Knob\\"), owns a seafood restaurant near the Acropolis; just before the series begins, he \\"rescues\\" his brother Heraclitus from the bush he had been living in. With Athens under siege by the Spartans, Heraclitus reluctantly takes charge of the food preparation area, with Socrates appreciating Heraclitus more for his cooking than for his stoicism. Aristophanes and Heraclitus's mother, identified only as the Oracle, is a former Pythia who took a sabbatical from Delphi because the \\"signs\\" she sees in her visions are commonplace 20th century traffic signs and posters. Xanthippe is a pervert, that is a heterosexual, in a society where homosexuality is normal. She has a crush on Socrates' friend Plato, who is oblivious to her advances. Frequent mention is made of Cynthia the Contortionist Flute-girl in suggestive contexts, but she never appears in person. The nature of the chorus varies from episode to episode. It may be the fish deliverymen on their daily round, a gang of former Olympians looking for a free meal, a band of sex-mad Spartans or the \\"unbelievably affable ones\\" (cheerful versions of the Furies) come to collect Socrates and take him to Hades. Several male voices speak in unison, with a lead voice underlining the occasional detail. The chorus was largely abandoned for the second series, with Heraclitus instead providing a brief introduction starting with the fact that he hates Athens. Cast * Stephen Moore as Heraclitus, Aristophanes' brother, Chief Restaurant Cook and tormentor. * Alan Cox as Aristophanes, playwright, poet, orator, and restaurateur. * Robert Hardy as Socrates * Tom George as Plato, Socrates' pupil, who will never amount to much * Rosemary Leach as The Oracle, mother of Heraclitus and Aristophanes. * Rachel Atkins as Xanthippe, wife of Socrates, and deviant heterosexual (Imelda Staunton in Series 2) * Gavin Muir as Chorus, Alcibiades, Shepherd, Uncle Liquidites Series 1 * Fish - The audience is introduced to all the people who own/frequent the restaurant and The Oracle brings disturbing news for Aristophanes. * Games - To avenge Aristophanes' insult to former Olympic champions, Plato (himself an Olympic champion) challenges Aristophanes to a race. * Gods - On Socrates' 85th birthday, \\"The Affable Ones\\" arrive to take him away for judgment in the Underworld ... and Aristophanes may be next! * Heroes - Alcibiades, a former Athenian hero (and narcissist) returns after having defected to Sparta ... in the middle of a \\"Frenzy\\"-ing craze. * War - A group of Spartans arrive as part of a course in Athenian Culture given by Socrates, but they don't seem to be in the mood for culture ... only staying in a bad mood (which is normal for Spartans), but when Xanthippe shows up they start feeling \\"something else\\" (as does she). * Sheep - Heraclitus' woolly former \\"girlfriend\\" Cassandra turns up expecting Heraclitus to be the greatest thinker in Athens, and he, Socrates, Plato and friends do battle in the Intellectual Olympics. Series 2 * Signs - Athens is being besieged by the Spartans and things are beginning to look bleak, especially when Uncle Liquidites turns up and demands that Plato give up philosophy and enter the funerary urn business. * Love - It's Eros Night and despite the hunger, all thoughts turn to love. But the recipients of that love (and the traditional site of love) aren't the expected choice (spoiler: it isn't the heart). * Plays - Due to his latest play being put on at the Ephesus Festival, Aristophanes has a safe conduct to leave Athens. However, when he sprains his ankle, Heraclitus plans to use the pass to escape Athens ... but if the play is performed, it will mean exposing Xanthippe to scorn and ridicule. * Sons - As food runs out, a man called Testicles arrives at the restaurant claiming to be the Oracle's long-lost son. * Sauce - Customers drop like flies after Heraclitus adds a little hemlock to the cockroach fritters, and Xanthippe has finally had enough and leaves Socrates. * Food - With starvation looking Athens and all our friends in the face, the restaurant regulars decide to have a \\"Last Supper\\" ... no food, just fine words, songs and ... hemlock.

Since most, if not all, Chinatowns founded in the 19th-century United States were founded by migrants from the province of Canton (Guangdong in mandarin Chinese, which is a spoken Chinese dialect different from that spoken by the Cantonese), many place names were transliterated from the Cantonese dialect. The word Â†Ç, \\"tong\\" or \\"tong4\\", means \\"hall\\". Known as the Bing Kong Tong Society (or Bing Kung Association in Seattle, Washington), the organization was one of the largest in California when the Hop Sing and Suey Sing Tongs allied against the Bing Kongs, instigating one of the most violent Tong wars in the United States. As the gang war continued, the numerous murders caught the attention of the press as the often gruesome slayings were detailed. Eventually an investigation headed by Santa Rosa, California, attorney Wallace L. Ware,Street, Richard Steven. Beasts of the Field: A Narrative History of California Farmworkers, 1769-1913.

Although this species is native to and most abundant in southern Madagascar, it can also be found in the rest of this island, and has been introduced to the islands of R√©union and Mauritius. It is a very long-lived species, with recorded lifespans of at least 188 years. These tortoises are classified as critically endangered by the IUCN, mainly because of the destruction of their habitat and because of poaching. Description The shell star-pattern of the radiated tortoise Growing to a carapace length of up to 16 in (41 cm) and weighing up to 35 lb (16 kg), the radiated tortoise is considered to be one of the world's most beautiful tortoises. This tortoise has the basic \\"tortoise\\" body shape, which consists of the high-domed carapace, a blunt head, and elephantine feet. The legs, feet, and head are yellow except for a variably sized black patch on top of the head. The carapace of the radiated tortoise is brilliantly marked with yellow lines radiating from the center of each dark plate of the shell, hence its name. This \\"star\\" pattern is more finely detailed and intricate than the normal pattern of other star-patterned tortoise species, such as Geochelone elegans of India. The radiated tortoise is also larger than G. elegans, and the scutes of the carapace are smooth, and not raised up into a bumpy, pyramidal shape as is commonly seen in the latter species. Sexual dimorphism is slight. Compared to females, male radiated tortoises usually have longer tails and the notches beneath their tails are more noticeable. Lifespan The stuffed remains of \\"Tu'i Malila\\", the longest-lived radiated tortoise on record The species is very long-lived. The oldest radiated tortoise ever recorded with certainty was Tu'i Malila, which died at an estimated age of 188.Tortoise Believed to Have Been Owned by Darwin Dies at 176 2nd to last paragraph mentions tu'i Malila's age A tortoise named Adwaita is widely believed to have been even older at his death in 2006. Range and distribution Radiated tortoises occur naturally only in the extreme southern and southwestern part of the island of Madagascar. They have also been introduced to the nearby island of Reunion. They prefer dry regions of brush, thorn (Diderae) forests, and woodlands of southern Madagascar. As the radiated tortoises are herbivores, grazing constitutes 80‚Äì90% of their diets, while they also eat fruits and succulent plants. A favorite food in the wild is the Opuntia cactus. They are known to graze regularly in the same area, thus keeping the vegetation in that area closely trimmed. They seem to prefer new growth rather than mature growth because of the high-protein, low-fiber content. Reproduction A pair of radiated tortoises mating Males first mate upon attaining lengths of about 12 in (31 cm); females may need to be a few inches longer. The male begins this fairly noisy procedure by bobbing his head and smelling the female's hind legs and cloaca. In some cases, the male may lift the female up with the front edge of his shell to keep her from moving away. The male then proceeds to mount the female from the rear while striking the anal region of his plastron against the female's carapace. Hissing and grunting by the male during mating is common. This is a very dangerous procedure and cases have been recorded where the female's shell has cracked and pierced the vaginal and anal cavities. Females lay from three to 12 eggs in a previously excavated hole 6-8 in (15‚Äì20 cm) deep, and then depart. A seven-day-old tortoise Incubation is quite long in this species, lasting usually between 5 and 8 months. Juveniles are between 1.2 and 1.6 inches (3.2 and 4 cm) upon hatching. Unlike the yellow coloration of the adults, the juveniles are a white to an off-white shade. Juveniles attain the high-domed carapace soon after hatching. Conservation These tortoises are critically endangered due to habitat loss, being poached for food, and being overexploited in the pet trade. It is listed on CITES Appendix I, commercial trade in wild-caught specimens is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). However, due to the poor economic conditions of Madagascar, many of the laws are largely ignored. No estimates of wild populations are available, but their numbers are declining, and many authorities see the potential for a rapid decline to extinction in the wild. In the North American studbook, 332 specimens are listed as participating in captive-breeding programs such as the Species Survival Plan. Captive breeding has shown great promise as in the captive-breeding program for the radiated tortoise at the New York Zoological Society's Wildlife Survival Center. In 2005, the Wildlife Survival Center was closed, and the radiated tortoise captive-breeding program was continued with the inception of the Behler Chelonian Center, the Turtle Conservancy's southern California conservation breeding center. In March 2013, smugglers were arrested after carrying a single bag containing 21 radiated tortoises and 54 angonoka tortoises (Astrochelys yniphora) through Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Thailand. On 20 March 2016, the customs officials at Mumbai airport seized 146 tortoises from the mishandled baggage of a Nepal citizen. This bag was said to belong to a transit passenger, who arrived from Madagascar and flew to Kathmandu, leaving this bag behind. Of the 146 tortoises, 139 were radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata) and seven were Angonoka tortoises (Astrochelys yniphora), both critically endangered tortoise species of Madagascar. Two radiated tortoises were found dead with broken shells. On 12 June 2016, it was reported that 72 radiated tortoises and six angonoka tortoises had gone missing from a breeding facility in Thailand. On 20 April 2018, more than 10,000 radiated tortoises were found in a home in Toliara. In total, the house contained 9,888 live radiated tortoises and 180 dead ones. Rescuers transported them to Le Village Des Tortues (\\"Turtle Village\\"), a private wildlife rehabilitation facility in Ifaty, 18 miles north of Toliara. A week after their discovery, 574 tortoises had died from either dehydration or infection. Three suspects (two men and a woman, the owner of the house) were arrested. The men were in the process of burying dead tortoises on the property when the team arrived.https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/wildlife-watch-radiated- tortoises-poached-madagascar/ References Further reading *Kirkpatrick, David D.

APM strives to detect and diagnose complex application performance problems to maintain an expected level of service. APM is \\"the translation of IT metrics into business meaning ([i.e.] value).\\"  Measuring application performance  Two sets of performance metrics are closely monitored. The first set of performance metrics defines the performance experienced by end users of the application. One example of performance is average response times under peak load. The components of the set include load and response times. :* The load is the volume of transactions processed by the application, e.g., transactions per second (tps), requests per second, pages per second. Without being loaded by computer-based demands for searches, calculations, transmissions, etc., most applications are fast enough, which is why programmers may not catch performance problems during development. :* The response times are the times required for an application to respond to a user's actions at such a load. The second set of performance metrics measures the computational resources used by the application for the load, indicating whether there is adequate capacity to support the load, as well as possible locations of a performance bottleneck. Measurement of these quantities establishes an empirical performance baseline for the application. The baseline can then be used to detect changes in performance. Changes in performance can be correlated with external events and subsequently used to predict future changes in application performance. The use of APM is common for Web applications, which lends itself best to the more detailed monitoring techniques. In addition to measuring response time for a user, response times for components of a Web application can also be monitored to help pinpoint causes of delay. There also exist HTTP appliances that can decode transaction- specific response times at the Web server layer of the application. In their APM Conceptual Framework, Gartner Research describes five dimensions of APM: * End user experience monitoring ‚Äì (active and passive) * Application runtime architecture discovery and modeling * User-defined transaction profiling (also called business transaction management) * Application component monitoring * Reporting & Application data analytics In 2016, Gartner Research has updated its definition, into three main functional dimensions: * End-user experience monitoring (EUEM) has been evolved to Digital experience monitoring (DEM); * A new dimension, Application discovery, tracing and diagnostics (ADTD), combines three formerly separate dimensions (Application topology [runtime architecture] discovery and visualization, User-defined transaction profiling, and Application component deep-dive), since all three are primarily focused on problem remediation and are interlinked; * Application analytics (AA).  Current issues  Since the first half of 2013, APM has entered into a period of intense competition of technology and strategy with a multiplicity of vendors and viewpoints. This has caused an upheaval in the marketplace with vendors from unrelated backgrounds (including network monitoring, systems management, application instrumentation, and web performance monitoring) adopting messaging around APM. As a result, the term APM has become diluted and has evolved into a concept for managing application performance across many diverse computing platforms, rather than a single market. With so many vendors to choose from, selecting one can be a challenge. It is important it evaluate each carefully to ensure its capabilities meet your needs. Two challenges for implementing APM are (1) it can be difficult to instrument an application to monitor application performance, especially among components of an application, and (2) applications can be virtualized, which increases the variability of the measurements. To alleviate the first problem application service management (ASM) provides an application-centric approach, where business service performance visibility is a key objective. The second aspect present in distributed, virtual and cloud-based applications poses a unique challenge for application performance monitoring because most of the key system components are no longer hosted on a single machine. Each function is now likely to have been designed as an Internet service that runs on multiple virtualized systems. The applications themselves are very likely to be moving from one system to another to meet service-level objectives and deal with momentary outages.  The APM conceptual framework  Applications themselves are becoming increasingly difficult to manage as they move toward highly distributed, multi-tier, multi-element constructs that in many cases rely on application development frameworks such as .NET or Java. The APM Conceptual Framework was designed to help prioritize an approach on what to focus on first for a quick implementation and overall understanding of the five- dimensional APM model. The framework slide outlines three areas of focus for each dimension and describes their potential benefits. These areas are referenced as \\"Primary\\" below, with the lower priority dimensions referenced as \\"Secondary. \\"  End user experience (primary)  Measuring the transit of traffic from user request to data and back again is part of capturing the end-user-experience (EUE). The outcome of this measuring is referred to as Real-time Application monitoring (aka Top Down monitoring), which has two components, passive and active. Passive monitoring is usually an agentless appliance implemented using network port mirroring. A key feature to consider is the ability to support multi-component analytics (e.g., database, client/browser). Active monitoring, on the other hand, consists of synthetic probes and web robots predefined to report system availability and business transactions. Active monitoring is a good complement to passive monitoring; together, these two components help provide visibility into application health during off peak hours when transaction volume is low. This slide outlines three areas of focus for each dimension and describes their potential benefits. User experience management (UEM) is a subcategory that emerged from the EUE dimension to monitor the behavioral context of the user. UEM, as practiced today, goes beyond availability to capture latencies and inconsistencies as human beings interact with applications and other services. UEM is usually agent-based and may include JavaScript injection to monitor at the end user device. UEM is considered another facet of Real-time Application monitoring.  Runtime application architecture (secondary)  Application Discovery and Dependency Mapping (ADDM) offerings exist to automate the process of mapping transactions and applications to underlying infrastructure components. When preparing to implement a runtime application architecture, it is necessary to ensure that up/down monitoring is in place for all nodes and servers within the environment (aka, bottom-up monitoring). This helps lay the foundation for event correlation and provides the basis for a general understanding on how network topologies interact with application architectures.  Business transaction (primary)  Focus on user-defined transactions or the URL page definitions that have some meaning to the business community. For example, if there are 200 to 300 unique page definitions for a given application, group them together into 8-12 high-level categories. This allows for meaningful SLA reports, and provides trending information on application performance from a business perspective: start with broad categories and refine them over time. For a deeper understanding, see Business transaction management.  Deep dive component monitoring (secondary)  Deep dive component monitoring (DDCM) requires an agent installation and is generally targeted at middleware, focusing on web, application, and messaging servers. It should provide a real-time view of the J2EE and .NET stacks, tying them back to the user-defined business transactions. A robust monitor shows a clear path from code execution (e.g., spring and struts) to the URL rendered, and finally to the user request. Since DDCM is closely related to the second dimension in the APM model, most products in this field also provide application discovery dependency mapping (ADDM) as part of their offering.  Analytics/reporting (primary)  It is important to arrive at a common set of metrics to collect and report on for each application, then standardize on a common view on how to present the application performance data. Collecting raw data from the other tool sets across the APM model provides flexibility in application reporting. This allows for answering a wide variety of performance questions as they arise, despite the different platforms each application may be running on. Too much information is overwhelming. That is why it is important to keep reports simple or they won't be used.

In 1929 she won the Pulitzer Prize for Novel/Literature for her novel Scarlet Sister Mary. She wrote several novels about the plantation South, especially the Gullah people of the Lowcountry. She was one of the few white authors who wrote about the African-American experience.  Life and career  Julia Mood was born in Laurens County, South Carolina. Her father was a physician, and she was the third of his four children. Her mother died soon after her birth, and her father later married Janie Brogdon. Janie was the mother of Henry Ashleigh Mood, Julia's half-brother and her father's fourth child. He became a doctor. In 1896, at age 16, Julia Mood graduated from Converse College in Spartanburg, South Carolina; she earned her master's degree there a year later. She taught at the public school in Fort Motte, South Carolina for a few years, then married William George Peterkin in 1903. He was a planter who owned Lang Syne, a cotton plantation near Fort Motte.\\"Remembering Julia Peterkin, who brought Gullah to the Masses\\", Cotton Boll Conspiracy blog, May 18, 2015 She began writing short stories, inspired by the everyday life and management of the plantation. She was described as audacious as well as gracious by Robeson (1995). Peterkin sent highly assertive letters to people she did not know and had never met. For example, she wrote to authors Carl Sandburg and H.L. Mencken, and included samples of her writing about the Gullah culture of coastal South Carolina. Living chiefly on the plantation, she invited Sandburg, Mencken, and other prominent people to the plantation. Sandburg, who lived within a day's travel in Flat Rock, North Carolina, made a visit. Although Mencken did not visit, he became Peterkin's literary agent in her early career, a possible testament to her persuasive letters. Eventually, Mencken led her to Alfred Knopf, who published Green Thursday, her first book, in 1924. In addition to a number of subsequent novels, her short stories were published in magazines and newspaper throughout her career. Peterkin was among the few white authors to specialize in the African-American experience. She won a Pulitzer Prize in 1929 for her novel Scarlet Sister Mary. Dr. Richard S. Burton, the chairperson of Pulitzer's fiction-literature jury, recommended that the first prize go to the novel Victim and Victor by John Rathbone Oliver. The School of Journalism chose Peterkin's book. Burton resigned from the jury. The book aroused some controversy in the South. The public library in the small town of Gaffney, South Carolina classified it as obscene and banned it. However, The Gaffney Ledger published the complete book in serial form. Peterkin performed as an actress, playing the main character in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler at the Town Theatre in Columbia, South Carolina, beginning in February 1932. In 1933, Peterkin was contacted by Caroline Pafford Miller of Baxley, Georgia. Miller was seeking a publisher for her first novel Lamb in His Bosom, and hoped to enlist Peterkin's help. Peterkin forwarded Miller's name and manuscript to her publisher. In 1933, Harper released Lamb in His Bosom. Miller won the Pulitzer Prize for the novel in 1934.

He is a former editor of The Independent on Sunday and the New Statesman. Early life and career Wilby was educated at Kibworth Beauchamp grammar school in Leicestershire before gaining a place at Sussex University. While at Sussex, from where he graduated with a degree in History, he helped found a short- lived university paper called Sussex Outlook. In 1968, he began his career as a reporter on The Observer, becoming Education Correspondent four years later. In the same role, he worked for the New Statesman (1975‚Äì77), and for The Sunday Times (1977‚Äì86). Wilby joined The Independent on Sunday in 1990 and eventually became its editor (1995‚Äì96). New Statesman editor Wilby was the editor of the New Statesman from 1998 to 2005. In February 2002, Wilby apologised and took personal responsibility for running the cover of the 14 January 2002 issue. It featured the headline, \\"A Kosher Conspiracy\\" promoting articles by Dennis Sewell and John Pilger respectively concerning the alleged Zionist lobby in Britain and Tony Blair appointment of Michael Levy as his special envoy in the Middle East. The NS cover was denounced by David Triesman, then general secretary of the Labour Party, as being antisemitic. Wilby, in his apology, wrote that the cover was \\"not intended to be anti- Semitic\\". \\"I don't accept that there's such a thing as New Labour\\", Wilby told David Lister of The Independent in July 2002. He described the term as being \\"an invention of the marketing people close to the Labour leader\\". A scoop Wilby was fond of at the time concerned an interview with the Physician, Professor and Labour peer Robert Winston, whose comparison of the National Health Service (NHS) with health provision in Poland, Wilby said had changed government policy. Julia Langdon wrote in the British Journalism Review around the same time that the NS under Wilby had a reputation in the \\"political trade\\" for \\"being either dull, or silly\\". With Wilby as editor, it had become \\"ever more critical of the Government, notably with the anti-American line he took after September 11\\". A New Statesman article in autumn 2004 by Robert Service, then Professor of Russian History at Oxford University, and in particular the cover illustration, portrayed Tony Blair as the modern equivalent of Joseph Stalin. Wilby's deputy, Cristina Odone, resigned in early November 2004 for unconnected reasons, although she did object to the cover. Odone and Wilby praised each other in the media and denied having had a row, although claims of such professional disagreements were made in the press quoting Odone herself. Wilby, she said, was \\"the old-fashioned socialist who\\" remained \\"true to his ideals\\". Wilby himself was dismissed from the post of editor in 2005 by then owner Geoffrey Robinson. As a result of the magazine being unsympathetic to New Labour, Cristina Odone wrote in The Observer that she believed Wilby was pushed out of his post in preparation for Gordon Brown becoming prime minister. Wilby was the longest serving editor of the New Statesman since Kingsley Martin, who had retired from the post in 1960. While circulation was much the same when he assumed the role as when he relinquished it in 2005, Wilby wrote in an article for the British Journalism Review that he managed to turn \\"a substantial financial loss into a healthy operating profit\\". Later career Wilby continues to write a weekly \\"First Thoughts\\" column for the Statesman. He also writes for The Observer and The Guardian. Wilby identifies as a feminist and a republican.

It lies southeast of Lurgan, within the parish of Donaghcloney, and the barony of Iveagh Lower, Lower Half. In the 2011 Census it had a population of 3,683 people. Over the years, the village has been bestowed numerous awards, including \\"Best Kept Small Town\\" for its floral displays and pleasant appearance. History The area of Waringstown was formerly part of the district of Clanconnell, which was within the Gaelic territory of Iveagh.Place Names NI After the Irish Confederate Wars, in which the sons of Glasney McAgholy Magennis of Clanconnell took part, their lands were confiscated by the English and shared among the Cromwellian soldiers in lieu of pay. By 1659, the area had been sold to Englishman William Waring, who built a fortified house on the site of an old fort. The weaving village of Waringstown developed under the auspices of William Waring and his descendants. Waring's son, Samuel, brought Flemish weavers to the village, building Huguenot style cottages for them, some of which survive today. In the past, the village was renowned for its handloom damask weaving. The industrial focus was at the southern end of the town, where brewing, linen-weaving, and cambric and clothing manufacture were formerly carried out and where some substantial 18th century and 19th century industrial buildings still exist. On 20 December 1990‚Äîduring the Troubles‚ÄîWilfred Wethers (46), a Protestant off duty Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer, was shot and killed by an Irish Republican Army (IRA) sniper while driving his car in Waringstown. Cricket The village has, over the years, been associated with the sport of cricket, something that has been attributed to the area's planters being predominantly from the North of England. The local team, Waringstown Cricket Club, has achieved some success in the NCU Senior League, playing its home matches at The Lawn. The club was established in 1851, by a member of the Waring family, and its ground was also donated by the family. The popularity of the sport in the village and its influence elsewhere has led to it being dubbed \\"The Home of Cricket in Ulster\\". The neighbouring village of Donaghcloney has a similar heritage in the sport. Education *Waringstown Primary School Demography On Census Day (27 March 2011) Waringstown had a population of 3,683 people, an increase of 45.6% on the Census 2001 figure of 2,529.

Early life Douglas-Home (he later dropped the hyphen from his surname) was the third son of Charles Douglas- Home, 13th Earl of Home, and Lady Lilian Lambton, daughter of the 4th Earl of Durham. His eldest brother was Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Prime Minister from 1963 to 1964. He was educated at Eton College and New College, Oxford, where he read History. His first play, Murder in Pupil Room, was performed by his classmates at Eton in 1926 when he was only fourteen. On 26 July 1951, he married the Hon. Rachel Brand (who later inherited the barony of Dacre), the daughter of Thomas Brand, 4th Viscount Hampden and 26th Baron Dacre, and Leila Emily Seely. They had four children. Political career During the Second World War, Douglas-Home contested three parliamentary by-elections as an independent candidate opposed to Winston Churchill's war aim of an unconditional surrender by Germany.William Douglas Home in the Dictionary of National Biography. The political parties in the wartime Coalition Government had agreed not to contest by-elections when a vacancy arose in a seat held by the other coalition parties. At the Glasgow Cathcart by-election in April 1942, he won 21% of the votes, and at Windsor in June 1942, he won 42%.Craig, p. 294. In April 1944, he came a poor third at the Clay Cross by-election, losing his deposit.Craig, p. 321. He had intended to contest the St Albans by- election in October 1943, but communications difficulties with the Army Council prevented him from receiving the necessary permission soon enough to meet the deadline for nominations.Nominations At St. Albans: Would-Be Candidate And Army Council, The Times, Tuesday 5 October 1943, p. 2.New M.P. For St. Albans, The Times, Wednesday 6 October 1943; p. 2. Post-war, Douglas- Home stood twice as the Liberal Party candidate in Edinburgh South, in a 1957 by-election, and the 1959 general election. He told a story in The Observer Magazine that he took a morning off from the 1959 election campaign to go shooting with his brother, four years before the latter became Conservative Prime Minister in 1963. Alec uncharacteristically missed all the birds in the first drive. When William asked him what was wrong, Alec replied \\"I had to speak against some bloody Liberal last night!\\" He had been unaware that the \\"bloody Liberal\\" was his own younger brother. William's comment was, \\"I would have given him a lift if I'd known he was going.\\" Previously, William had briefly been the Conservative Party prospective parliamentary candidate for Kirkcaldy Burghs before resigning over foreign policy differences. The elections in South Edinburgh had done much to revive Liberal support in the city, following as they did on the first win by a Liberal candidate in Newington Ward in the constituency. Party members were dismayed when he abruptly resigned as a member, apparently because he was not called to speak on a motion on the United Nations during a Party Conference. This was the end of his active political career. Military service Despite his opposition to the policy of requiring the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany he was conscripted into the Army in July 1940 and joined the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment).William Douglas Home. Mr Home pronounced Hume, London, Collins, 1979, p. 51. He went to 161 Officer Cadet Training Unit (161 OCTU) in the buildings of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where one of his colleagues was David Fraser. At Sandhurst, he was critical of the war, which he said had been unnecessary.Fraser, David. Wars and Shadows, Memoirs of General Sir David Fraser, pub Allen Lane, 2002. pp. 151‚Äì158. Douglas-Home was commissioned in the Buffs in March 1941.London Gazette entry While an officer he stood in the three parliamentary by-elections. Douglas-Home was assigned to the 7th Battalion of the Buffs, which was converted to tanks as the 141st Regiment, Royal Armoured Corps. In the Normandy campaign, the 141st Regiment was assigned to I Corps (a British formation) within the First Canadian Army. In August, First Canadian Army was directed to mop up the German forces cut off and trapped in various seaside ports in Normandy and Pas de Calais. In the first week of September 1944, the Allies moved against the port of Le Havre. A German garrison under Colonel Hermann-Eberhard Wildermuth was dug in on the hill overlooking the city. Wildermuth had been ordered by Hitler to defend Fortress Le Havre to the last man, and not to surrender. When the Allied forces invested the city in advance of the planned aerial bombardment and subsequent assault, Wildermuth asked the British commander if the French civilians could be evacuated from the city, but that request was refused. Lieutenant (acting Captain) Douglas-Home was near Le Havre, awaiting the completion of the aerial bombardment. He was to serve as a liaison officer in Operation Astonia, the Allied attack on Le Havre. On the second day after the aerial bombardment had started, he learned of the German request to evacuate the civilians and the Allied refusal. The consequences of the bombardment were apparent to the waiting Allied forces and Douglas-Home refused to participate in the attack. He gave two reasons: * The unconditional surrender policy, which he thought compelled the enemy to fight to the end. * The refusal of civilian evacuation was morally unacceptable to him. which created a moral obligation for Douglas-Home and he declined to participate. The aerial bombardment of Le Havre lasted four nights, killed over 2,000 French civilians, 19 German soldiers and levelled the city. The Germans surrendered after two-days' fighting and I Corps moved on to Boulogne, which was also subjected to a heavy aerial bombardment. At that time Douglas-Home, who had been placed under supervision (he did not consider himself at that time to have been \\"arrested\\") wrote to the Maidenhead Advertiser and the publication of his letter in the newspaper prompted his formal arrest and detention. Douglas-Home was charged at a Field General Court Martial held on 4 October 1944 that, when on active service, he disobeyed a lawful command given by his superior officer (contrary to Section 9 (2) of the Army Act 1881). He conducted his own defence. Regrettably neither the Field Court Martial nor Douglas-Home had a copy of the new edition of the Manual of Military Law, which had been prepared and published in April 1944 but not distributed to the troops in Normandy. Prior to April 1944 a British soldier accused of refusing to obey an order had no defence available that the order was illegal. Even had that been brought to the Court-Martial's attention, the grounds of objection by Douglas-Home for refusing to obey Colonel Waddell's order were rejected as he had to admit that the order, to act as a liaison officer, was not illegal. His argument, that he was being required to take part in an event which was morally indefensible, fell on deaf ears. He was convicted, and sentenced to be cashiered and to serve one year's imprisonment with hard labour. The proceedings lasted two hours.Smith, R. C. (1998) Refusal of Orders: the case of William Douglas Home. WaiMilHist. Because of the article in the Maidenhead Advertiser, the Allied forces besieging Calais allowed the civilians to be evacuated from the town before it was subjected to a heavy aerial bombardment and final assault. Dunkirk was allowed to remain in German hands, with the besieged force bottled up, until Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945. In the wake of the publication, the British became sensitive to indiscriminate bombing of occupied cities and towns, although that consideration was not extended to towns and cities in Germany. One of the officers, Second Lieutenant James Wareing, described Douglas Home as follows: Another officer described the incident in front of Le Havre as follows: Wareing continued Captain Andrew Wilson, M.C. also served in 141 RAC. In his autobiography Flame Thrower, published in 1956, he recounts this incident and its consequences. Wilson wrote his story deliberately in the third person: In 1988, Douglas-Home was roused to challenge his cashiering for disobeying orders, in the wake of an article in The Times, prompted by the election of Kurt Waldheim as the president of Austria. The article attacked Waldheim, who was claimed to have been a Schutzstaffel (SS Officer) in the Greek theatre of war, supervising the loading of prisoners who were being transported north for imprisonment or worse. The article asserted that Waldheim should have disobeyed those orders. It was argued that if Waldheim had disobeyed those orders he would have been punished and probably executed. Douglas-Home accordingly applied for a pardon and was told that he had to petition the War Office to reverse the sentence of the Court Martial. He was supported in his efforts by the military law expert Professor Gerald Draper OBE, who died in the midst of preparing the arguments supporting the petition. His argument was that the attack on Le Havre was morally indefensible, because of the failure to evacuate civilians and that even though he was not engaged directly in attacking those civilians, he was entitled to refuse to take part in the operation or to support it. It was Professor Draper who had discovered that the current edition of the Manual of Military Law had not been available to the October 1944 Field Court Martial. The duty on a soldier not to obey an illegal order, because a morally indefensible operation rendered all orders underpinning it illegal, did not find favour with the War Office, which focused solely on the order, which Douglas-Home had never denied he had disobeyed. Sir David Fraser's take on it was that he did not question Douglas-Home's courage but he had disobeyed an order and he was properly punished for doing so.Andrew Knapp; \\"The Destruction and Liberation of Le Havre in Modern Memory\\" (War In History, 2007) The petition was rejected; Douglas-Home had to rely on the judgement of the public as to whether, some three decades after one of the worst civilian tragedies in French history, indiscriminate aerial bombing of civilians in pursuit of wartime objectives was acceptable.See: Hero of Le Havre?

William Douglas-Home to JYR in conversation 1988‚Äì1991 and in preparation for, conduct of, and in the wake of the Petition for setting aside the conviction and sentence of 4 October 1944 Field Court Martial. Playwright William Douglas-Home wrote some 50 plays, most of them comedies in an upper class setting. \\"In the space of a month or two after his release he wrote two plays which were successful in London in 1947. The first, Now Barabbas, was based on his experience in gaol and in the latter some of the characters were drawn from his family.\\" Although Douglas-Home was a prolific playwright, his works have neither the depth nor the durability of such near contemporaries as Rattigan or Coward. However, his play The Reluctant Debutante (1955) has been adapted twice into film. The first film, called The Reluctant Debutante, released in 1958, featured Rex Harrison and Sandra Dee, with a screenplay by the playwright himself. The second was released in 2003, under the title What a Girl Wants, starring Amanda Bynes, Colin Firth, and Kelly Preston. The remake features a hereditary peer in the House of Lords who disclaims his title to stand for election to the House of Commons. Douglas-Home's brother Alec was one of the first to do so after the Peerage Act 1963. As part of the 1975 centennial season of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, Douglas-Home wrote a curtain raiser called Dramatic Licence, in which Richard D'Oyly Carte, W. S. Gilbert, and Arthur Sullivan plan the birth of Trial by Jury in 1875. Peter Pratt played Carte, Kenneth Sandford played Gilbert, and John Ayldon played Sullivan.Forbes, Elizabeth.

While the overall tone of the program was that of a mystical fantasy, it frequently incorporated elements of dark humor, horror, and even outright comedy. A total of six episodes were produced before low ratings led to its cancellation. The series has subsequently been shown on the Sci Fi Channel as part of their Series Collection. The series began showing on NBC Universal's horror and suspense- themed cable channel, Chiller in March 2009. Overview Nightmare Cafe broadly concerns the inhabitants of the titular otherworldly caf√©: mysterious proprietor Blackie, sarcastic but good-hearted cook Frank, and insecure yet gutsy waitress Fay. During the show's limited run, the origins of the caf√© were never revealed, but it has the power to materialize in any location, and seems to be sentient on some level (in one episode, it refuses to allow Frank to enter until he apologizes to it). The caf√© is usually situated by a waterfront; when it changes its location, its inhabitants realize that they are about to be given a mission. Themes Nightmare Cafe is a show about second chances. Characters who enter the caf√©‚Äîpresumably drawn there by the caf√© itself, as an embodiment of fate‚Äîare given the opportunity to correct something in their lives that went wrong if they are morally good; or if they are morally bad, to atone for something they have done or will do, sometimes against their will, and often incorporating poetic justice. The caf√© The caf√© serves as both a central location for the action and as a plot catalyst, primarily by exerting its influence upon each episode's protagonist(s), or antagonist(s), to bring them into contact with the regulars. Aside from transporting itself from place to place in its entirety, once settled, it can also create portals between itself and various locations, which are traversed (often unexpectedly, on the whim of the caf√©) by crossing the threshold of one of the caf√©'s many doorways. These portals are not restricted to the Earth; the caf√© can also travel to outer space and, apparently, even heaven. The caf√© also has the ability to make both idle and heartfelt wishes come true, which of course are not always what the recipient actually wants or needs, and the caf√© seems to take a perverse delight in \\"misinterpreting\\" such wishes. Frank and Fay often take advantage of this ability by wishing themselves from place to place; when this occurs, or when the caf√© otherwise deems it important, those remaining in the dining room can watch the exploits of their companions on the (sometimes interactive) television set mounted in the far wall. Cast * Robert Englund as Blackie * Jack Coleman as Frank Nolan * Lindsay Frost as Fay Peronivic Origins Creator Wes Craven's original concept for the series involved standalone episodes akin to The Twilight Zone or Amazing Stories, but with regular characters bookending the tales (\\"like Twilight Zone meets Cheers\\", as Craven often said in interviews). NBC gave Craven the green light, but when he prepared to write the pilot, he realized that he wanted the regular characters to also be the main characters. Despite the show being retooled before the pilot was even written, contemporary critics still often referred to Nightmare Cafe as a \\"supernatural/horror anthology\\" series. The series itself was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the city waterfront doubling for the waterfront that served as the caf√©'s \\"home base\\". Although the production team originally toyed with the idea of filming in a real diner, that idea was eventually scrapped, and a set was built in Vancouver's North Shore Studios. The set was built to be mobile, as certain scripts called for parts of the cafe interior to appear in completely different locations; it was also built with a ceiling, unusual for television at the time, and each booth was given an authentic 1940s' era table jukebox, rented from a private collector. The pilot episode of Nightmare Cafe was first \\"officially\\" aired on February 28, 1992 at 10 pm EST. However, NBC decided to lead off its new season of shows with a special \\"sneak preview\\" night, in which one of its new programs would be unveiled early, in order to generate advance buzz and get a jump on the season. That \\"secret\\" episode was the pilot of Nightmare Cafe, although in actuality it wasn't much of a surprise, since many TV writers had already disclosed which program was to be shown. Reception The pilot debuted to mixed ‚Äî although overall positive ‚Äî reviews, with comparisons drawn to the Nightmare on Elm Street series of movies (no doubt due to Craven and Englund's involvement), The Twilight Zone, Fantasy Island, Quantum Leap, Cheers, Moonlighting and Topper. Variety was more critical and believed that the only scary thing about Nightmare Cafe is that \\"NBC put it on its schedule\\". Episodes References in popular culture * In the fourth-season Seinfeld two-part episode \\"The Pitch\\" and \\"The Ticket\\" (both aired September 16, 1992), a Nightmare Cafe promotional poster - featuring the three leads in front of the caf√© door - can be seen on one wall of the NBC lobby. * In The Simpsons episode \\"Treehouse of Horror V\\" (aired October 30, 1994), the title of the third segment -- \\"Nightmare Cafeteria\\" -- is a reference to Nightmare Cafe. Merchandise * A soundtrack, featuring the incidental music of J. Peter Robinson as well as five songs used in the show, was released by Var√®se Sarabande in 1992. Opening sequence Following the pilot, the remaining five episodes began with an introduction narrated by Robert Englund as Blackie: :\\"Touch that remote and you die! Now that I've got your attention, here's the deal. See those two people? That's Frank, and that's Fay. Strangers when they met, turns out they've got a lot in common. Both died on the same night, both ended up in the same body of water, and both took refuge in the same all-night cafe. Me, I run the place. Name's Blackie. Been here from the beginning. Now, I know I said Frank and Fay were dead, but the cafe needed a new cook and waitress, so it gave them a second chance at life. They do their job, they get to stick around and help unsuspecting customers turn their lives around. 'Course, anything can happen to those who wander in - their worst nightmares, or their forbidden dreams. Yeah, it all happens here...in this little place we call the Nightmare Cafe.\\" Another version of this introduction appears on the soundtrack album, also performed by Englund: :\\"Lost somewhere between Life and Death, Time and Eternity, there are places which, if entered into, will leave you forever changed. This is one such place. Its every door can lead some to that second chance that will turn their lives around... and to others to that reckoning that will end their sleep forever.

During the French and Indian War in 1757‚Äì1758, several hundred French and Indian troops traveled the Great Shamokin Path in an effort to destroy Fort Augusta, the main stronghold of the English at the junction of the east and west branches of the Susquehanna River. This army was gathered from the French posts at Duquesne, Kittanning, Venango and Le Boeuf and assembled at the mouth of Anderson Creek. Here, crude boats, rafts and bateau were constructed for passage down the Susquehanna River for the proposed attack. They dragged along with them two small brass cannon, but after reconnoitering found the distance too great for the guns to shoot from the hill opposite the fort. The defense at Fort Augusta was strong enough to resist attack by storming or by siege, and the attack was abandoned. A British defeat at Fort Augusta could have altered the history of the course of the French and Indian War.M.I. McCreight, Du Bois History, Memory Sketches of Du Bois, Pennsylvania: A History, (1939), p.69. In 1772, John Ettwein and his group of some 200 Lenape and Mohican Christians traveled west along the Great Shamokin Path from their village of Friedensh√ºtten (Cabins of Peace) near modern Wyalusing on the North Branch Susquehanna River to their new village of Friedensstadt (City of Peace) on the Beaver River in southwestern Pennsylvania. Moravian expeditions The Anderson Creek corridor is part of the Great Shamokin Path from the native village Shamokin, on the Susquehanna River, to Kittanning, Pennsylvania, on the Allegheny River. The Anderson Creek area was known by Native Americans as \\"the place where there is a mountain halfway on the other side\\". Native Americans recognized that Anderson Creek was the boundary between two river systems, the Susquehanna River and the Ohio River. For several decades in the early 18th century, the villages of Shamokin and Kittanning were two of the most important Native American villages in Pennsylvania. Perhaps the path's best known use was by Moravian Bishop John Ettwein and his group of some 200 Lenape and Mohican Christians in 1772. They traveled west along the path from their village of Friedensh√ºtten (Cabins of Peace) near modern Wyalusing on the North Branch Susquehanna River to their new village of Friedensstadt on the Beaver River in southwestern Pennsylvania. \\"The Big Spring\\" in Brady Township, Pennsylvania, was an important junction connecting the Great Shamokin Path and Goschgoschink Path. The private travel diary of the Rev. Johann Roth, a Moravian Church missionary among the Indians in the American East, describes his journey along the Anderson Creek corridor in the summer of 1772. In this account of his day-by-day progress, the Rev. Roth mentions a number of Delaware (or Lenni Lenape) Indian names for Pennsylvania. Roth mentions a night camp in a region which the Indians called \\"Wachtschunglelawi awossijaje.\\" These are really three words, Wachtschiink leldwi awossijaje: wachtsch[u], 'a hill, mountain'; -iink, locative suffix, 'place where'; leldwi, 'halfway, in the middle'; awossijaje, 'over, over there, beyond, on the other side, behind.' This makes the three words signify, 'place where there is a mountain halfway on the other side'; or, rather, 'where there is a mountain halfway between the one side and the other.' That is, 'a divide' between two river systems; in this case, between the Susquehanna River and the Ohio River.This divide extends over Brady and Bell Twps., Clearfield County.\\" Mahr, \\"How to Locate Indian Places on Modern Maps\\", The Ohio Journal of Science, May 1953, pp. 129, 134. The Mead brothers and French Creek In his report to Governor Robert Dinwiddie, George Washington made reference to a beautiful rolling country, suitable for settlement, that he had found along the waters of French Creek. In 1788, brothers John and David Mead were ready to investigate Washington's story, and left Fort Augusta, now Sunbury, Pennsylvania, to explore the far west. They journeyed up mouth of Anderson Creek and turned at Coal Hill towards camp site and crossroads at The Big Spring. From there, they continued northwest on the Goschgoschink Path to the Venango Path and the waters of French Creek. On May 12, 1788, the Mead brothers founded Meadville, Pennsylvania, at the confluence of Cussewago Creek and French Creek. War of 1812 During the War of 1812, Major William McClelland departed Fort Loudoun, near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, on March 4, 1814, and marched a division of troops numbering two hundred and twenty-one privates, three captains. five lieutenants and two ensigns along Anderson Creek to meet the Goschgoschink Path, later known as Mead's Path, at The Big Spring, Brady Township, Pennsylvania.\\"The Goschgoschink Path begins at the junction of the Great Shamokin Path at \\"Big Spring\\" near Luthersburg. The path then proceeds to Thunderbird Spring, Sandy Valley Station, north of Reynoldsville, thence through the Horme Settlement and slightly north of Emerickville to Brookville; north of Clarion, to Franklin and along French Creek to LeBoeuf and Presque Isle at Lake Erie. These soldiers with their wagon train of equipment and cannon camped at Thunderbird Spring (Old State Road), just east of Kiwanis Trail, and near the Jefferson‚ÄìClearfield County Line. The march from Fort Loudoun to Erie took twenty-eight days.They encamped at Soldier‚Äôs Run, in what is now Winslow Township, rested at Port Barnett for four days, and encamped over night at the \\"four mile spring\\", on what is now the Afton farm. Elijah M. Graham was impressed with his two \\"pack horses\\" into their service, and was taken as far as French Creek, now in Venango County. These soldiers were volunteers and were from Franklin County. Major McClelland, with his officers and men, passed through where Brookville now is. Three detachments of troops left Franklin County during the years 1812‚Äì1814 at three different times, one by way of Pittsburgh, one by way of Baltimore, and the last through this wilderness. Upon the arrival of these troops at Erie they were put into the Fifth Regiment of the Pennsylvania troops, commanded by Col. James Fenton, of that regiment, the whole army being under the command of Maj. Gen. Jacob Brown. These soldiers fought in the desperate battles of Chippewa and Lundy‚Äôs Lane, on July 5 and 25, 1814. William James McKnight, M.D., A Pioneer History of Northwestern Pennsylvania, 1905, p.243. Major William McClelland's division relieved American forces at Lake Erie and later gave a good account of themselves at the Battle of Chippewa and Battle of Lundy's Lane.Major Israel McCreight, Memory Sketches of Du Bois Pennsylvania 1874-1938: A History, (1939) at pp. 68‚Äì71. See Wallace, Indian Paths of Pennsylvania, (1965), at p.61. Underground Railroad The various paths, river routes and safe waypoints that escaped slaves and their guides used in their journey northwards towards freedom are collectively known as the Underground Railroad. In western Pennsylvania, routes began at the Maryland‚ÄìPennsylvania border and traveled through Bedford, Pennsylvania, where the route split and converged at the Great Shamokin Path at the mouth of Anderson Creek. From there, the route led to The Big Spring near Luthersburg, Pennsylvania, and thence on Meade's Path to the Venango Path, Lake Erie and onward to Canada. Quaker settlers living along the Great Shamokin Path in Clearfield County did what they could to assist escaped slaves. The natural topography and terrain of the Eastern Continental Divide provided excellent cover and access to the zigzagging, sometimes backtracking, and myriad alternative routes that were needed to ensure the secrecy of the \\"Railroad.\\"Switala, William J. The Underground Railroad in Pennsylvania pp. 30‚Äì37, 2001. Anderson Creek corridor The historic Anderson Creek corridor was later used for railroad passenger travel and commercial transportation of logs, coal and stone. Early settlers established logging mills and villages along Anderson Creek, and a railroad from Du Bois, Pennsylvania, to Curwensville, Pennsylvania, was completed in 1893. The settlement of Home Camp, Union Township, was once a thriving logging town with saw mills, splash dams and boarding houses for lumbermen. Water was sufficient for floating logs to the West Branch Susquehanna River. The last log drive on Anderson Creek was in 1901.Hughes, A Twentieth Century History of Clearfield County, Pa. (1900-2000) , 2006, at 1290‚Äì1291. The area is also rich in history from more recent times. During the Golden Age of railroading, passengers and freight rolled along this route, taking students to school and soldiers to war. Millions of tons of coal were pulled along this route, and stone quarried for bridges and buildings throughout the East. Clay was also extracted, with brickyards all along the tracks. Raftsmen plied the Susquehanna, riding logs to market hundreds of miles downstream. The resources help fuel the industrial might of the nation. This trail today is a resource as precious as the coal, timber, stone, and clay carried on the rails along this corridor.See Skip Cleaver on the Clearfield-Grampian Trail. Recently, the Anderson Creek corridor has been considered as a venue for environmental and recreational tourism.\\"Local citizens look optimistically at the Anderson Creek Gorge as a major recreational draw for the region. An abandoned railroad traverses much of the Anderson Creek Gorge and development of a rail-to-trail using this rail line would connect nicely with the trail along Kratzer Run and the West Branch Susquehanna River. Additionally, other nearby rail trails could be connected to an Anderson Creek rail trail. Improving the water resource will be a key to developing any additional recreational and economic value within the watershed. Recreational boaters also consider Anderson Creek a challenging whitewater stream. Its numerous rapids and remote character make it an appealing whitewater run. Only its poor water quality degrades what could be a premier boating experience.\\" Anderson Creek Watershed: Assessment, Restoration, and Implementation Plan, Western PA Conservancy, PA DEP and U.S. EPA at II-19, September 2006\\\\.

The Bickford Railroad Line This pagoda styled railroad switching house at C. & M. Junction, Brady Township, Pennsylvania, was constructed in 1913 and sits abreast the Bickford Line of the former Clearfield & Mahoning Railroad Company. In 1881, the shipping interests of the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway became eager to have an eastern outlet and what is known as the Clearfield & Mahoning Railroad Company obtained a charter from the State and built a line from C. & M. Junction in Brady Township, Pennsylvania, by way of Luthersburg and Curwensville, to Clearfield, Pennsylvania. The first construction work was started in June 1892, and the first passenger train over this road was run on the first day of June 1893\\\\. The line is 17.4 miles long and is named after the Bickford junction west of Curwensville.Pentz, William C., The City of Du Bois, pp. 161‚Äì162, 1932. The Bickford Line traveled along the Eastern Continental Divide bounding Anderson Creek from Rockton, Union Township, Pennsylvania, to the West Branch Susquehanna River at Bridgeport, Pennsylvania. The line is no longer active and the rails have been removed. The last passenger train ride on the Bickford Line from Du Bois to Clearfield was on June 15, 1954, and hundreds of local residents enjoyed the historic journey. The railroad tracks have been removed and the ownership of the right-of-way is uncertain.\\"Reconnecting the B&P; with the RJC in Clearfield would provide a needed 18-mile connection.\\" See North Central PA LRTP at p. 44. The old rail line is popular with ATV enthusiasts. Du Bois Reservoir The Du Bois Reservoir in Union Township, Clearfield County, consists of 210 acres, has a listed capacity of 615 million gallons and is located near the headwaters of Anderson Creek. The reservoir is a PA DCNR Conservation Area and serves as the water supply for the City of Du Bois. The Du Bois Reservoir is also known as the Anderson Creek Reservoir. The dam at Du Bois Reservoir controls the flow of water from the headwaters of Anderson Creek. Village of Rockton Rockton is a village in Union Township, Clearfield County, resting along Anderson Creek near Brown Springs in the Moshannon State Forest. Rockton gets its name from a time when the stagecoach came over the mountain from Clearfield with the mail, and passengers would argue about the weight of a large rock.Hughes at 1297. Rockton had its own school, weekly newspaper, several stores, three churches, a number of mills, both grist and lumber, and an emergency landing field for air mail pilots. Farms did well in the shelter of the surrounding mountains. Rockton was divided in two, upper and lower. What is known as Rockton today was begun through lumbering by people such as John Brubaker. In 1885, Jason E. Kirk and David W. Kirk built a steam-powered feed mill. Lower Rockton began in 1837 with a saw mill and grist mill built by Jason Kirk and Jeremiah Moore. It sits along Anderson Creek as did the wool mill of William Johnson. The Kirk mill was designed to provide adequate height and space at the front of the building for men and horse-drawn wagons to load and unload products. Rockton once had rail service on the Bickford Line from Du Bois to Clearfield. The Buffalo, Rochester & Pittsburgh Rockton Station built in 1898 was dismantled in the 1970s and is now in Kane, Pennsylvania.The Rockton (BR&P;) Station was originally built in 1898 for the Buffalo, Rochester & Pittsburgh Railroad at Rockton, Pennsylvania, on the Clearfield Branch. The depot was dismantled and first moved to Sloan Cornell's Penn View Mountain Railroad near Blairsville, Pennsylvania, in the 1970s. The depot was dismantled and moved a second time to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on Sloan Cornell's Gettysburg Railroad in the late '70s. An expansion of the nearby Gettysburg College later necessitated the station to be dismantled and placed in storage. The station was moved a third time and recently reassembled in Kane, Pennsylvania, on Cornell's Knox and Kane Railroad. The reassembly was in progress when a tornado destroyed several piers of the Kinzua Bridge. The station has been finished, but regular passenger and freight service has ceased on the K&K;, and the railroad is for sale. ‚Äì See Kevin Moore, 2007, at http://www.west2k.com/pastations/clearfield.shtml. The greatest disaster for Rockton was a tornado on September 14, 1945, beginning in the Coal Hill area of Brady Township. Many buildings were destroyed with the Hollopeter Poultry Farm receiving most of the damage. The William Irwin house was moved several inches off of its foundation and a barn demolished. The storm cleared a path approximately 100 feet wide and eight miles long. After the storm crossed Anderson Creek and moved up Montgomery Run, it dispersed. No one was injured. Today, Rockton has a post office, one church, St. John's Lutheran, an auto repair shop, and a fire department.Gene M. Aravich, Du Bois Area Historical Society at http://duboishs.com/index.php/rockton/ David S. Ammerman Trail Once known as the Clearfield and Grampian Trail, in 2011, the name was changed to the David S. Ammerman Trail in memory of the man who championed turning the abandoned rail corridor into a recreational trail. The David S. Ammerman Trail traverses Anderson Creek in Curwensville, Pennsylvania, and connects to Grampian, Pennsylvania, and Clearfield, Pennsylvania.

Lifeblood employs around 3,700 employees across scientific, clinical and support services, processing over half a million non-remunerated blood donations each year. In November 2019, the division was renamed from the Australian Red Cross Blood Service to Australian Red Cross Lifeblood. Lifeblood is primarily funded by the Australian Government and states and territory governments. History The Red Cross's Australian blood services were initially managed by state-level organisations. Victoria's Blood Transfusion Service was founded in 1929, and by 1941 each state had its own Organ Transfusion Service. Also in 1941, the National Emergency Blood Transfusion Service (later the National Blood Transfusion Committee) was formed to coordinate the state groups. In 1945, the Red Cross took over blood and serum preparation units established by the Australian Army. In 1995, a government report recommended the foundation of a separate national structure, and the ARCBS was formed in 1996, encompassing the old state and territory blood donation/transfusion services. On 15 November 2019, what was formerly the Australian Red Cross Blood Service changed its name and branding to the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, citing its increasing responsibility for non-blood products such as plasma, tissue, organs and breast milk. Relationship with CSL Australian Red Cross Lifeblood and its predecessors had a long-standing relationship with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL), a government medical body founded in 1916. The Red Cross supplied CSL with donated blood for use in research and manufacture of medical products (e.g. serum for transfusion). In 1994, CSL was privatised, becoming CSL Limited. The ARCBS continued to supply CSL with donated blood. Infectious diseases Blood donated in Australia has been tested for Hepatitis B since 1972, HIV-1 since 1985, Hepatitis C since 1990, HIV-2 since 1992/3, and HTLV-1 since 1993. As with other blood transfusion services, the ARCBS has had to strike a balance between protecting blood recipients against infection, and accepting enough donors to maintain an adequate supply of blood. This has led to debate over which categories of potential donors should be excluded. For example, to protect against CJD, the ARCBS now refuses donations from anybody who lived in the United Kingdom for a total of six months or more between 1980 and 1996. In 2003, a federal government report found that despite the introduction of Hepatitis C screening from February 1990, infected donors were told to keep donating until July of that same year; a total of 20,000 people were estimated to have been infected with Hepatitis C via blood products. Some infected blood was given to CSL and may have been used in thousands of CSL products, although it has not been shown that any of these products caused infection in the recipients.http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/14/1052885298025.html The service has a policy of barring men who have had sex with men (MSM) during the previous twelve months from donating blood (an earlier policy had excluded any men who had had sex with other men since 1980, regardless of time elapsed). This has been the source of ongoing controversy, with a case (in 2008) referred to the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Commission.http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/15/2337087.htm Gay safe sex poses low risk to blood supply, tribunal hears People who have engaged in heterosexual or female-to-female sex during the past 12 months are allowed to give blood. Female-to-female transmission is considered by the Centers for Disease Control to be rare.http://www.thebody.com/cdc/femtrans.html Female-to- Female Transmission of HIV CDC National AIDS Hotline Training Bulletin #139 As well as deferring blood donations from MSM, other categories of sexual activity can also result in a 12-month deferral, such as sex with a prostitute or having a partner who has tested positive to hepatitis B or C. Australian Red Cross Blood Donor Eligibility In 2014, gay men again requested that the Australian Red Cross Blood Service permit them to donate blood. The Red Cross, in noting their concern, said they were receptive to a reduction in the current deferral period from 12 to 6 months. However, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration has rejected their submission on this issue, arguing that there would be a greater risk of HIV without a significant increase in blood supply. The Red Cross say they do not defer based on sexuality or relationships, but rather on sexual activity and for this reason it is not possible to deal with MSM on an individual basis. In April 2020 the Therapeutic Goods Administration revised the deferral period for MSM down to three months. The revision requires approval of the federal, state and territory governments before it can go into effect. Lifeblood are predicting the new rules will come into effect by early 2021. The spokesperson said they empathise with those who can‚Äôt give blood.

After serving in the U.S. Army., his experiences of racism within the army led him to tenant organizing in New York City, where he joined the Black Panther Party as it formed, becoming a defendant in the Panther 21 case. Sentenced to a term of between 23 to 29 years, he escaped from Rahway State Prison in New Jersey and went underground with the BLA in 1978. In January 1982, He was captured and charged with participating in an armored truck armed robbery, known as the Brinks robbery (1981), in West Nyack, New York, on October 20, 1981, an action in which two police officers, Waverly Brown and Edward O'Grady, and a money courier (Peter Paige) were killed. Convicted of murder and other charges and sentenced to life imprisonment, he died in prison of pneumocystis pneumonia, an AIDS-related illness, on December 13, 1986, aged 39. Balagoon authored several texts while in prison, writings that have become influential among black and other anarchists since first being published and distributed by anarchist prisoner support networks in the 1980s and 1990s.  Political Statements  In his Brinks Robbery 1981 trial, Balagoon made the following statements in defense of the BLA and its actions: \\"The B.L.A. is an organization that takes credit for pre-planned assassinations. In our history there are numerous instances of ambushed police where credit was clearly taken, where communiqu√©s were issued to the media ... These ambushes have always been retaliations for terrorist acts against Black people.\\" \\"The goal of an expropriation is to collect revolutionary compulsory tax and not casualties. A unit is no better off with a guard killed. Shots are signals that alert more police more quickly and directly than an onlooker‚Äôs phone call. Guerrillas prefer to take the weapons from the holsters of guards or pick them up after they‚Äôve been dropped, and completing the action without anyone except guards and guerrillas being any the wiser.\\" \\"The B.L.A. has a history of aiding the escapes of comrades from prisons and other detention centers.

This is not because they think we can break out of handcuffs, waist chains and leg chains and then dive out of closed car windows and sprint to the next county before anyone notices what is going on. They do this because the B.L.A. does not forfeit comrades in the hands of the enemy and does not forfeit those who struggle beside us into the hands of the enemy.

Barit, and rarely, if ever, referred to by his full given name. In addition to A.E. Barit, contemporary news magazines and newspapers sometimes referred to him as \\"Ed Barit\\" or \\"Edward Barit\\". (August 30, 1890 ‚Äì July 14, 1974) was an American industrialist who served as the president and CEO of the Hudson Motor Car Company from 1936 to 1954 when Hudson merged with Nash Motors to form American Motors Corporation. Barit served on the board of AMC following the merger of the two automakers.  Career  Barit was born to poor parents in Jersey City, New Jersey. He was briefly the secretary for the purchasing agent at the Chalmers-Detroit Motor Company.Hyde, p. 137. He began his career with Hudson in 1910, by joining the firm's purchasing department, less than six months after the production of the company's first automobile. He was a stenographer, and had no flair for market analysis, product development, nor design. Barit was named president and CEO of Hudson following the death of the corporation's founding president and CEO Roy D. Chapin in 1936. Using lines of credit arranged for Chapin prior to his death, Barit helped to steer Hudson back towards profitability in the late 1930s. Sales of Hudson rebounded through the economic recession of 1938. The company also survived a negative financial year in 1941, recouping its loss through World War II production contracts. In 1945, Barit successfully fought off a below market rate tender offer for Hudson Motors by the Fisher family‚Äîfounders of General Motors Fisher Body division. The conservative Barit gave the go-ahead for Hudson's step-down body design‚Äîa revolutionary design that catapulted the firm to the forefront of automotive body engineering in the postwar market. When combined with the firm's Twin-H straight-6, Hudson's corporate sponsored race teams, headed by Marshall Teague, dominated the NASCAR circuit from 1951 through 1954. In the early 1950s, instead of reshaping Hudson's aging step- down design, or investing in V8 engine technology, Barit instead guided the company toward developing a compact car that Hudson could market. He \\"meddled\\" in the development and design of the company's products, failing to capitalize on the expertise of the firm's professionals in those areas. Instead of relying on engineering and styling to duplicate the previous success of the step-down design, Barit imposed his own requirements for chair high seating, and allowed others outside of Hudson to influence the design, which emerged as the antithesis of the low-slung step-down bodies. The new compact car, named the Hudson Jet, did not attract buyers, and the expense of its development (and failure) combined with Hudson's lack of resources to update their senior line of cars spelled the end for the company. Hudson Motors was subsequently acquired through a friendly merger by Nash Motors in 1954, creating American Motors. Barit served on the Board of AMC until 1956 when he resigned in protest over the likelihood that Hudson would be phased out of production. Barit felt that his trust in AMC had been betrayed. George W. Romney, AMC's President, felt that Hudson and Nash were no longer relevant players in the automotive market and retired both names at the end of the 1957 model year production. According to his son, Robert Barit, the last car that A.E. Barit owned was a Hudson, and after it was retired, he refused to own any other make of automobile. A.E. Barit died at his home in Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan on July 14, 1974.  Footnotes  External links * Sources * \\"Business: Happy Days\\". Editors.

They mostly inhabit coastal salt and brackish waters, although some occur in fresh water. Mojarras are a common prey and bait fish in many parts of the world, including the South American coast and Caribbean islands as well as the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast of North America.Northeast Gulf Science Vol. 5 No. 1 1981 These species tend to be difficult to identify in the field and often require microscopic examination. Most species exhibit a schooling behavior and tend to exploit the shallow water refugia associated with coastal areas presumably to avoid large-bodied predators, such as the lemon shark. Mojarra is also commonly used in Latin American countries as a name for various species of the cichlid family, including tilapia.

The Tarentaise Valley () is a valley of the Is√®re River in the heart of the French Alps, located in the Savoy region of France. The valley is named for the ancient town of Darantasia, the capital of the pre-Roman Centrones tribe. John Lempri√®re, Lorenzo DaPonte, & John David Ogilby (1839), Bibliotheca Classica: Or, A Dictionary of All the Principal Names and Terms, (Tenth American Edition), New York: W.E. Dean. Centrones, p. 69 Description At the foot of the valley, in the west, is the city of Albertville. Going east up the valley, Mo√ªtiers is reached, then Aime, and finally the last large town, Bourg-Saint-Maurice. The area is internationally best known for its world-renowned ski resorts, including Les Trois Vall√©es (Courchevel, M√©ribel, Val Thorens etc.‚Äîoff a side valley from Mo√ªtiers), Paradiski with La Plagne above Aime, and Les Arcs above Bourg-Saint-Maurice. Espace Killy with Tignes and Val-d'Is√®re is further up the valley. These communities hosted most of the events for the 1992 Albertville Winter Olympics. A weekly lift ticket in any of the described systems gives skiers a choice to ski one day in each of the other two systems mentioned. There were once plans to interlink all systems and resorts to create the‚Äîby far‚Äîlargest ski area in the world. However that vision was ended with the creation of the Vanoise National Park. Other ski areas includes Sainte-Foy-Tarentaise, La Rosi√®re, and Valmorel. In the winter, the valley is a cul-de-sac, with its road finishing at Val d'Isere. In the summer, there is a pass over to the Maurienne Valley at the head of the valley (the Col de l'Iseran), and a couple of others further down, including the Little St Bernard Pass eastwards to Italy via La Rosiere and La Thuile and the Cormet de Roselend northwards. Both sides of the valley, but especially the sunnier northern side, have rural farming communities all the way along. The colder southern side tends to be dominated by the ski resorts but has occasional small hamlets. Transport The valley has a railway as far as Bourg-Saint- Maurice, which, in the winter season, has various direct sleeper trains from Paris and Eurostar trains from London. The valley road (the N90) is dual carriageway as far as Mo√ªtiers, after which it becomes a standard two-lane but single-carriageway road, which can see substantial queues in winter. This road is currently receiving funding from the European Union for a significant improvement project between Aime and Mo√ªtiers, one of the narrowest points in the valley.

He was part of three NFL Championship teams, one as a player and two as a head coach. Early years Born on a farm near Lamont in eastern Washington, Flaherty grew up in Spokane and was a multi-sport athlete at Gonzaga High School (now Gonzaga Prep) and Gonzaga University, where he played with Hust Stockton under head coach Gus Dorais. As a freshman, Flaherty attended Washington State College in Pullman, then transferred to Gonzaga before his sophomore year. Pro football Player Flaherty began his professional football career in 1926 with the Los Angeles Wildcats of the American Football League, a team of western players based in Illinois. It played all its games on the road in its only season, which ended with a post-season barnstorming tour through the South against league rival New York Yankees. Flaherty then played in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons, first with the Yankees (1927‚Äì1928) with Red Grange, until the franchise folded near the end of the 1928 season. He joined the New York Giants, playing their final game in 1928 through the 1935 season, except for 1930, when he returned to Spokane as the head coach at his alma mater, Gonzaga. He also coached the Bulldog basketball team for a season (1930‚Äì1931). At the end of the 1935 season, Flaherty's jersey number 1 was 'taken out of circulation', thus making Flaherty the first professional athlete to have his number retired. At age 26, Flaherty played a season of minor league baseball in 1930, as a second baseman with the Providence Grays of the Eastern League. Head coach Following his playing career, Flaherty was hired by George Preston Marshall, owner of the NFL's Boston Redskins, as head coach for the 1936 season. The team won the division title that year, then relocated to Washington, D.C. for the 1937 season, and picked up future hall of fame quarterback Sammy Baugh in the first round of the 1937 NFL draft. In seven seasons at the helm of the Redskins, Flaherty won four division titles (, , , ) and two NFL Championships (1937, 1942). Among his innovations on offense, Flaherty is credited with inventing the screen pass in 1937. The Redskins held their 1940 training camp in Spokane at Gonzaga; the previous year's camp was also held in Spokane County, at Eastern Washington College in Cheney. In 1941 and 1942, the Redskins trained in California in San Diego at Brown Military Academy. Flaherty served as an officer in the U.S. Navy during World War II, then returned to pro football in 1946 as a head coach in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). With the New York Yankees, he won division titles in each of his two full seasons at the helm, but lost to the Cleveland Browns in the title games. After a poor start in 1948, owner Dan Topping relieved Flaherty of his duties in mid-September. Several months later he was hired as head coach of the AAFC's Chicago Hornets, known as the Rockets in their three previous seasons. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1976 for his contributions as a coach. After football After the end of the AAFC in 1949, Flaherty returned to the Spokane area to enter private business as a beverage distributor, and lived in nearby northern Idaho. During football season, he was a part-time columnist for the Spokane Daily Chronicle. A college friend of Bing Crosby, Flaherty participated in the singer's Spokane memorial service in 1977. After an extended illness, Flaherty died in 1994 in Hayden, Idaho at the age of 90; he and his wife Jackie (1921‚Äì2007) are buried at St. Thomas Cemetery in Coeur d'Alene.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/68750966/raymond-p_-flaherty See also * History of the New York Giants (1925‚Äì78) References External links   Category:1903 births Category:1994 deaths Category:American football ends Category:Boston Redskins head coaches Category:Gonzaga Bulldogs football coaches Category:Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball coaches Category:Gonzaga Bulldogs football players Category:Gonzaga Preparatory School alumni Category:Gonzaga University alumni Category:New York Giants players Category:New York Yankees (NFL) players Category:Washington Redskins head coaches Category:Los Angeles Wildcats players Category:National Football League players with retired numbers Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:Basketball coaches from Washington (state) Category:People from Whitman County, Washington Category:Sportspeople from Spokane, Washington Category:Players of American football from Washington (state) ","title":"Ray Flaherty"},{"id":"4481733","text":"Speed Stick is a brand of deodorant/antiperspirant produced by multinational healthcare company Colgate-Palmolive.

A biogas is a gaseous form of methane obtained from biomass. By upgrading the quality to that of natural gas, it becomes possible to distribute the gas to customers via the existing gas grid within existing appliances. Renewable natural gas is a subset of synthetic natural gas or substitute natural gas (SNG). Renewable natural gas can be produced and distributed via the existing gas grid, making it an attractive means of supplying existing premises with renewable heat and renewable gas energy, while requiring no extra capital outlay of the customer. The existing gas network also allows distribution of gas energy over vast distances at a minimal cost in energy. Existing networks would allow biogas to be sourced from remote markets that are rich in low-cost biomass (Russia or Scandinavia for example). Renewable natural gas can also be converted into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for direct use as fuel in transport sector. The UK National Grid believes that at least 15% of all gas consumed could be made from matter such as sewage, food waste such as food thrown away by supermarkets and restaurants and organic waste created by businesses such as breweries.The Guardian 'Food waste to provide green gas for carbon-conscious consumers' In the United States, analysis conducted in 2011 by the Gas Technology Institute determined that renewable gas from waste biomass including agricultural waste has the potential to add up to 2.5 quadrillion Btu annually, being enough to meet the natural gas needs of 50% of American homes. In combination with power-to-gas, whereby the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide fraction of biogas are converted to methane using electrolyzed hydrogen, the renewable gas potential of raw biogas is approximately doubled. Many ways of methanising carbon dioxide/monoxide and hydrogen exist, including biomethanation, the sabatier process and a new electrochemical process pioneered in the United States currently undergoing trials.  Manufacturing  A biomass to SNG efficiency of 70% can be achieved.Cornerstone environmental group, LLC 'Biomethane / Natural Gas Interconnection Opportunities'Kachan & Co. 'The Bio Natural Gas Opportunity' Costs are minimised by maximising production scale and by locating an anaerobic digestion plant next to transport links (e.g. a port or river) for the chosen source of biomass. The existing gas storage infrastructure would allow the plant to continue to manufacture gas at the full utilisation rate even during periods of weak demand, helping minimise manufacturing capital costs per unit of gas produced.Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands 'Heat from Biomass via Synthetic Natural Gas' Renewable gas can be produced through three main processes * anaerobic digestion of organic (normally moist) material * thermal gasification of organic (normally dry) material * production through the Sabatier reaction. In these cases, the gas from primary production has to be upgraded in a secondary step to produce gas that is suitable for injection into the gas grid.Danish Gas Technology Centre 'Sustainable Gas Enters the European Gas Distribution System'  Commercial Development  BioSNG G√∂teborg Energi opened the first demonstration plant for large scale production of bio-SNG through gasification of forest residues in Gothenburg, Sweden within the GoBiGas project. The plant had the capacity to produce 20 megawatts-worth of bioSNG from about 30 MW-worth of biomass, aiming at a conversion efficiency of 65%. From December 2014 the bioSNG plant was fully operational and supplied gas to the Swedish natural gas grid, reaching the quality demands with a methane content of over 95%. The plant was permanently closed due to economic problems in April 2018. G√∂teborg Energi had invested 175 million euro in the plant and intensive attempts for a year to sell the plant to new investors had failed. It can be noted that the plant was a technical success, and performed as intended. However, natural gas is at a very low price given market conditions globally. It is expected the plant is to re-emerge around 2030 when economic conditions may be more favourable, with the possibility of a higher carbon price. SNG is of particular interest in countries with extensive natural gas distribution networks. Core advantages of SNG include compatibility with existing natural gas infrastructure, higher efficiency that Fisher-Tropsch fuels production and smaller-production scale than other second generation biofuel production systems. The Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands has conducted extensive research on large-scale SNG production from woody biomass, based on the importation of feedstocks from abroad. Renewable natural gas plants based on wood can be categorised into two main categories, one being allothermal, which has the energy provided by a source outside of the gasifier. One example is the double-chambered fluidised bed gasifiers consisting of a separate combustion and gasification chambers. Autothermal systems generate the heat within the gasifier, but require the use of pure oxygen to avoid nitrogen dilution. In the UK, NNFCC found that any UK bioSNG plant built by 2020 would be highly likely to use ‚Äòclean woody feedstocks' and that there are several regions with good availability of that source.'Potential for BioSNG Production in the UK, NNFCC 10-008'New Energy Focus 'BioSNG could be economically attractive for renewable heat' Upgraded biogas In the UK, using anaerobic digestion is growing as a means of producing renewable biogas, with nearly 90 biomethane injection sites built across the country. Ecotricity announced plans to supply green gas to UK consumers via the national grid.The Guardian 'Food waste to provide green gas for carbon-conscious consumers' Centrica also announced that it would begin injecting gas, manufactured from sewage, into the gas grid.The Guardian 'Human waste turned into renewable gas to power homes' In Canada, FortisBC, a gas provider in British Columbia, injects renewably created natural gas into its existing gas distribution system.Kachan & Co.'New Bio Natural Gas May Assist In Adding Solar and Wind to Utility Renewable Power Generation, Study Finds' Sustainable synthetic natural gas Sustainable SNG is produced by high temperature oxygen blown slagging co-gasification at 70 to 75 bar pressure of biomass or waste residue. The advantage of a wide range of feedstocks is that much larger quantities of renewable SNG can be produced compared with biogas, with fewer supply chain limitations. A wide range of fuels with an overall biogenic carbon content of 50 to 55% is technically and financially viable. Hydrogen is added to the fuel mix during the gasification process, and carbon dioxide is removed by capture from the purge gas 'slip stream' syngas clean-up and catalytic methanation stages. Large scale sustainable SNG will enable the UK gas and electricity grids to be substantially de-carbonised in parallel at source, while maintaining the existing operational and economic relationship between the gas and electricity grids. Carbon capture and sequestration can be added at little additional cost, thereby progressively achieving deeper de- carbonisation of the existing gas and electricity grids at low cost and operational risk. Cost benefit studies indicate that large scale 50% biogenic carbon content sustainable SNG can be injected into the high pressure gas transmission grid at a cost of around 65p/therm. At this cost, it is possible to re-process fossil natural gas, used as an energy input into the gasification process, into 5 to 10 times greater quantity of sustainable SNG. Large scale sustainable SNG, combined with continuing natural gas production from UK continental shelf and unconventional gas, will potentially enable the cost of UK peak electricity to be de-coupled from international oil denominated 'take or pay' gas supply contracts. Applications: * Electricity generation * Space heating * Process heating * Biomass with carbon capture and storage * Transportation fuel  Policy and Legal Frameworks for Renewable Gas  Environment Biogas creates similar environmental pollutants as ordinary natural gas fuel, such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, hydrogen sulfide and particulates. Any unburned gas that escapes contains methane, a long lived greenhouse gas. The key difference from fossil natural gas is that it is often considered partly or fully carbon neutral, since the carbon dioxide contained in the biomass is naturally renewed in each generation of plants, rather than being released from fossil stores and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide.

History The Saskatchewan Legislative Building being constructed The Saskatchewan Legislative Building was built between 1908 and 1912 in the Beaux Arts style to a design by Edward and William Sutherland Maxwell of Montreal. The Maxwells also supervised construction of the building by the Montreal company P. Lyall & Sons, who later built the Centre Block of the federal Parliament Building in Ottawa after the 1866 Parliament Building was destroyed by fire in 1916. Piles began to be drilled for the foundations during the autumn of 1908 and in 1909 the Governor General of Canada, the Earl Grey, laid the cornerstone. In 1912, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, by then the serving governor general, inaugurated the building. People enjoying a boat race on Wascana Lake north of the Legislative Building circa 1910. The design contemplates expansion of the building by the addition of wings extending south from the east and west ends and coming together to form a courtyard. The plans originally called for the exterior of the building to be red brick but after construction had begun and red bricks were already on the site, Premier Walter Scott decided that Manitoba Tyndall stone would give the building greater grandeur and the plans were adjusted with the substitution increasing the building cost by $50,000. The total cost of construction came to $1.75 million by the time of its opening in October 1912, ten months after the assembly had begun meeting in the yet-uncompleted building. In 1965, Clifford Wiens started a major project of renovation and restoration which took some fourteen years to complete. Leslie Jen, associate editor at Canadian Architect, called it a \\"masterful\\" renovation. Characteristics The legislative chamber inside the Saskatchewan Legislative Building with its original red carpet Diverging from parliamentary tradition, the carpet in the legislative chamber was red until 2012. Traditionally, red carpet is used for houses of unelected members, such as the Senate of Canada, and houses of elected members are given blue or green carpet. Walter Scott preferred red carpet, and for a century the Saskatchewan Legislative Building stood as one of only two in Canada to feature red carpet in its legislative chamber (British Columbia's being the other). The red carpet was replaced by green carpet in the summer of 2012. Walter Scott anticipated that the building might \\"for a century yet be credible enough to form the main building on the Capital grounds\\", the general assumption of the time being that Saskatchewan's population would grow to several million. That century has long since elapsed; the provincial legislative building remains the main building on the \\"Capital grounds\\", but indeed, continues to be the most imposing structure in a city smaller than its founders envisioned. Such planning is evident in the legislative chamber itself, designed to accommodate 125 members. The assembly has never expanded beyond 66 MLAs (and currently has 61). As a result, even after those elections which yielded massive majorities (such as those held in 1982, 1991, and 2011) there has been plenty of space to seat all government members to the speaker's right. The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at Saskatchewan Legislature.Stained glass at Saskatchewan Legislature http://stainedglasscanada.ca/site.php?site=174 The Saskatchewan Legislative Building is located at 2405 Legislative Drive, Regina, overlooking Wascana Lake. Free tours of the facility are offered throughout the week. Significance The legislative building and its grounds were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2005. It is also a Provincial Heritage Property under the Heritage Property Act. Of historical significance, the table that was used during the meeting of the Fathers of Confederation in Quebec City in 1864 resides in the building's library, albeit with six feet of it removed. Lieutenant-Governor Edgar Dewdney of the North-West Territories brought the table to Regina, which was the capital of the territory at the time. It was used in the offices of the Indian commissioner for Manitoba and the North-West Territories until 1896. Six feet of the table length was removed from the middle so that it could fit within the limited confines of the Prince Edward Building, the temporary home of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan while the Saskatchewan Legislative Building was under construction. Statues at Legislature Statue of Queen Elizabeth II north of the building Current statues An equestrian statue of Queen Elizabeth II unveiled in 2005 at the renamed Queen Elizabeth II Gardens stands in front of the legislative building. It was designed by Susan Velder. The statue depicts the Queen atop Burmese, her favourite horse, a gift from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1969. The horse was originally bred in Saskatchewan. On the eastern side of the building there is a fountain, one of two brought from London's Trafalgar Square, the other having been taken to Ottawa (and now located at Confederation Park). The Peterhead granite fountain was designed by McDonald and Leslie and were relocated before the mid 1930s when Trafalgar Square obtained new fountains designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Removed statue The commissioned statue of Louis Riel by John Cullen Nugent unveiled in 1968 stood on the grounds of the legislature until 1991, when it was removed at the insistence of the Saskatchewan M√©tis Society and others. Some found the work demoralizing for depicting Louis Riel in a \\"disrespectful\\" manner: \\"gaunt\\" and semi-nude, in the moment of ultimate M√©tis humiliation. Others argued that the sculpture was Euro-Canadian appropriation.

It was started on October 9, 1998, by Eugeny Naidenov, a student of the economic faculty of Kaliningrad State University, Russia. Community UG has over 12 million registered users. It is a strong community of forum users who frequent the site. The website is regulated by an administrator and moderators. Moderators are users that are rewarded for being particularly helpful and knowledgeable in a specific subject and are responsible for moderating forums that focus on the subject they specialize in. Inappropriate words used to be censored by a computer that searched for and replaced undesired words posted within the community, until September 1, 2015, when censorship of curse and swear words was lifted on the website. Community members may also create guitar lessons, and have their approved works published on the website and read by its users. Reviews of albums, DVDs, or gear and news articles can also be submitted by members. Like the tabs, the lessons and columns are also rated by users, which attributes towards UG Points (or rather number of contributions), users' UG score also increases, or decreases as the members rate their contribution. Although UG encourages participation, they also have a strict guideline and set of rules that all UG users must follow. Members must be over the age of 13 to use the services offered by the site and only one account is allowed to be made per person. Strong media is also prohibited from use on the site. Some members of the community have collaborated with other fellow users to develop musical projects via the website's forums and some of these community projects have been released as compilation albums. One of the most notable of these recent projects was the \\"Blues & Jazz Album II\\", which featured fourteen original tracks submitted by a number of community members, released for digital download with all profits going to Tipitina's Foundation. The project's community page can be found here, and the digital download is available on iTunes. There have been several other collaborative albums made by community members that are available for free download within the forums, including two electronic albums, a rock album and an acoustic album. Features The Pit is the part of the site where the registered UGers can discuss multiple topics, including those that do not necessarily have to do with guitar or even music, including political, religious and topical issues. Although The Pit is a miscellaneous section, all standards are upheld. On August 12, 2007, the Ultimate Guitar site launched \\"UG Profiles\\", a feature which allowed users to add profiles for each of their bands, upload pictures of themselves, as well as gear, display their \\"guitar skills\\", join groups of interest, and add other users to friends lists. This was intended for networking, advertising gear, and bands in a similar way to other sites such as MySpace. At one time the site featured MP3 functionality, allowing users to upload their own recordings to their profiles, however that feature was disabled due to lack of use and legal liability in the case of copyright violations. The MP3 functionality was removed some time before September 1, 2014. Users are able to request tablature in the site's Tab Talk forum. Tabs can be voted from 1 star (the worst) to 5 stars (the best), and comments can be made about the tab. Tabs of entire albums can also be submitted. Files such as basic guitar tabs and bass tabs can be read from an Internet browser, or copied and viewed off-line in a text editor in ASCII format. Guitar Pro and Power Tab files are run through programs that can play the tablature. These files can be saved and opened on the user's computer. Tabs are searchable by artist, album, or song name.for example: Songs in non-European languages are often romanized. Relationships with music publishers and songwriters In late 2004‚Äì05, after taborama and mxtabs.net began closing due to legal threats from the Music Publishers Association of America, UG saw a surge of new users flock to the community. UG was not affected by the MPA legal actions, since UG has license agreements with thousands of publishers, including Sony, EMI, Peermusic, Alfred, Hal Leonard, Faber and Music Sales, through which the songwriters receive compensation for the display of the tabs. On April 10, 2010, Ultimate Guitar entered a licensing agreement with Harry Fox Agency. The agreement included rights for lyrics display, title search and tablature display with download and print capabilities. HFA's over 44,000 represented publishers have the opportunity to opt into the licensing arrangement with UG.

Alfieri, a self-described 'class clown', created his own sketch comedy act to entertain friends. At the age of 18, a photographer invited him to do an advertising shoot and soon he graced the covers of several Italian magazines, known as fotoromanzi. His modeling career was cut short, when during an encounter with three muggers his face was scarred by injuries requiring more than 56 stitches. In 1991, Alfieri turned from modeling to join the Italian Police Force. He quit the force after two and a half years of service and, determined to start a career in Hollywood, Alfieri packed his bags and moved to Los Angeles, to the disbelief of his relatives back in Italy. Alfieri quickly landed work as an actor, with various television spots and two contracts roles on daytime TV Days of Our Lives (1996‚Äì1998) and The Bold and the Beautiful (1999‚Äì2000, 2004, 2009).

Population: History The first Russian settlers founded a village on the present site of Nevelsk in 1789. The region was the site of a struggle for control between the Russians and Japanese. After the Treaty of Shimoda officially transferred the southern Kuril Islands to Japan in 1855, the settlement was placed under joint Russian-Japanese administration under the name Honto. Nevelsk before 1945 Honto reverted to complete Russian administration in 1875, as the Treaty of Saint Petersburg gave control of all the Kuril Islands to Japan, in exchange for complete Russian sovereignty over the island of Sakhalin. It then returned to Japanese rule in 1905, after the Treaty of Portsmouth ceded southern Sakhalin to Japan to end the Russo- Japanese War. Sakhalin's first ice-free harbor was constructed here between 1916 and 1927, and the settlement developed as a center for the local fishing industry. The end of World War II saw the Soviet Army retake the full island of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. The settlement was granted town status in 1947 under its present name, in honor of Admiral Gennady Nevelskoy. The town was damaged by the 2007 Sakhalin earthquake (near the Tatar Strait), leaving about two thousand people homeless.\\"Tent camps set up for 2,000 left homeless by quake near Sakhalin Island\\". International Herald Tribune (published Aug. 3, 2007): \\"The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.4, struck August 2 on the southern tip of Sakhalin\\" Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Nevelsk serves as the administrative center of Nevelsky District and is subordinated to it.Law #25-ZO As a municipal division, the town of Nevelsk and ten rural localities of Nevelsky District are incorporated as Nevelsky Urban Okrug.Law #524 Economy The town's economy relies largely on fishing and associated industries. Due to relatively warm ocean currents, the town is located in the mildest climatic zone on the island of Sakhalin, making possible agriculture in the surrounding region. There have been recent efforts to develop the area as a tourist area for marine animal viewing, diving and yachting.

The PL stands for \\"positive lock\\". It is the successor mount to the Arri bayonet; unlike the bayonet mount, however, it is incompatible with older Arri-mount lenses, due to the larger diameter. (This can be rectified with an adapter relatively easily, as the flange focal distance is identical.) Overview The mount contains four pronged flanges that each contain a notch towards the center. Any of these four notches can be used to align the mount to a locating pin located approximately 45 degrees clockwise from the top of the camera's lens mount. This means that the lens can be oriented in any of four different configurations, which may be decided by factors such as focus puller position, camera position, and preference to working with meters or feet (if a lens has different line indicators on each side). The mount is locked into place using a friction locking ring that, in conjunction with the four prongs of the flange, creates a very strong lens seating. This has become a crucial factor in recent years, as bigger lenses with zoom capabilities, longer focal lengths, or larger lens elements have increased the need for mount stability due to the greater stress placed upon the mount by these devices. Furthermore, the tendency is for flange focal distance to become a more critical factor as sharper lenses, film stock with higher resolving power, and post-production workflows that preserve more of the original camera negative's information continue to make technological progress and advancement. Flange focal distance is also more likely to be rigorously checked as tastes for wider angle lenses continue to push the envelope, as wider lenses have a much narrower tolerance for lens displacement. Technical specifications *Flange focal distance: 52.00 mm (51.97 mm for the Arri SR high speed models) (73.5 mm for Arriflex 765, that mount is known as \\"Maxi PL- mount\\")(60.00 mm for XPL-mount on ALEXA65) (44 mm for the LPL-mount on ALEXA LF) *Diameter: 54.00 mm (64.00 mm for Maxi PL-mount) (72.00 mm for XPL-mount on ALEXA65) (62 mm for the LPL-mount on ALEXA LF) *Cameras: **35 mm: Arriflex 35III (later models), Arriflex 35BL3 (later models), Arriflex 35BL4, Arriflex 35BL4S, Arriflex 535, Arriflex 535B, Arriflex 435, Arriflex 435ES, Arriflex 435 Advanced, Arriflex 435 Xtreme, Arricam ST, Arricam LT, Cinema Products FX35, Moviecam SuperAmerica, Moviecam Compact, Moviecam SL, Aaton 35 **16 mm: Arriflex 16SR2 (later models), Arriflex 16SR3, Arriflex 16SR3 Advanced, Arriflex 416, Aaton XTRplus (standard), Aaton XTRprod (standard), Aaton A-Minima **65 mm: Arriflex 765, ARRI ALEXA 65 (uses the XPL-mount) **Digital: Arri Alexa, Arriflex D-20, Arriflex D-21, ALEXA65, ALEXA LF, Dalsa Origin, Dalsa Origin II, Sony F35, Sony F65, Phantom, Canon C300 PL, AJA Cion, Blackmagic Design URSA, Blackmagic Design Cinema Camera PL *** PL-mount available with an adapter: Ikonoskop A-Cam dII, Silicon Imaging SI-2K, Sony F3/F5/F55, Blackmagic Cinema Camera mFT/Pocket Cinema Camera *** PL-mount available with a third-party adapter: Sony Œ±7S, Panasonic GH4 *** PL-mount optional by user choice: Canon EOS C300, Canon EOS C500, Red One, Red Epic, Red Scarlet), Digital Bolex (uses interchangeable mounts), Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro (uses interchangeable mounts) See also *Sony FZ-mount References External links *List of some arri-mount lens.

Written by series creator/executive producer David Chase and supervising producer Matthew Weiner, and directed by longtime series director Allen Coulter, it originally aired in the United States on May 16, 2004. This episode is unique in that it features an elaborate 20-minute dream sequence, alluded to in the title, featuring many actors from past seasons reprising their roles briefly.

After visiting her in a hospital burn unit, Tony calls on Tony B. Tony notices that his cousin is behaving erratically, but does not know the reason: Tony B has just learned that Angelo, his former cellmate and close friend, has been murdered by Phil and Billy Leotardo. Tony B says he has to leave soon with his sons, so Tony himself leaves. Tony checks into a luxury suite at the Plaza Hotel \\"to get a good night's sleep\\", and nearly runs into Dr. Melfi there. When evening comes, a bored Tony starts drinking and nuisance-calls Charmaine Bucco, to whom he is attracted; she tells her unknown caller to stop it. Running through TV channels, he sees an advert for an escort agency and makes a call for an Asian girl. He gets a voicemail from Silvio telling him about Angelo's murder. He immediately tries to call Tony B, who is already on the move and is not answering his phone. Tony then frantically calls Tony B's casino, Aunt Quintina, and the Bada Bing, telling everyone to let Tony B know he is looking for him. The prostitute arrives and, at some point, Tony falls asleep and has a long, vivid dream. \\\\- - - Tony encounters the deceased Carmine Lupertazzi and receives a phone call telling him to kill somebody. Next, he sits in Melfi's office and is counseled by his deceased \\"ex-goomah\\" Gloria Trillo. He then finds himself riding in the backseat of a 1959 Cadillac Eldorado being driven by his long-dead father Johnny Boy Soprano and accompanied by the also-deceased Big Pussy Bonpensiero and Mikey Palmice. Mikey briefly turns into Artie. When Tony asks where they are going, Pussy--who has now turned into Ralphie Cifaretto--turns around and says, \\"We're driving you to the job.\\" The dream cuts to Tony waking up at his house and preparing to go to dinner with Carmela to meet Finn's parents at Nuovo Vesuvio. When they finally arrive, Finn's father is the deceased Detective Vin Makazian, while his mother is Annette Bening. Finn occasionally turns into A.J. during the course of the dinner. Next, Tony's teeth start to fall out while Finn's father starts singing \\"Three Times a Lady\\". Tony tries and fails to get Bening's attention. In the restroom with Vin, Tony reaches behind a toilet tank trying to find a gun. He hears shots fired outside and sees Tony B shooting Phil in his car. A crowd blames Tony and chases him; during the pursuit Lee Harvey Oswald shoots at him. He escapes in the Cadillac with help from Artie. Tony looks in the backseat and sees the deceased Richie Aprile and Gigi Cestone. Tony is then seen having wild sex with Charmaine, while her husband Artie coaches him. The dream jumps suddenly to Tony sitting on Pie-O-My in his living room, with Carmela allowing him to return home on condition that he does not bring his horse (whores) there. At the end of the dream, Tony is confronted by Mr. Molinaro, his high school football coach, who criticizes Tony's lifestyle and points out how he didn't have to be a criminal and live with all the stress that comes with being one. When Tony tries to shoot Molinaro, his gun malfunctions and the bullets seemingly melt in his hands; the coach continues to taunt him about not being prepared. \\\\- - - Tony awakens with a start. Shortly afterward, he receives a visit from Christopher, who tells him that Tony B has killed Billy and wounded Phil. Tony goes to bed and, though it is not dawn yet, calls Carmela. He says, \\"I had one of my Coach Molinaro dreams.\\" She is half asleep and they have a gentle, slow conversation. Deceased * Angelo Garepe: murdered by Phil and Billy Leotardo. * Billy Leotardo: murdered offscreen by Tony Blundetto to avenge the death of Angelo Garepe. Title reference * David Chase explained that the title refers to the dreams where an individual turns up late for a test in school and is wearing no clothing, meaning that the person is unprepared for a test or another task they have to face. Tony is unprepared to murder his coach in his dream. He is also unprepared for the dilemma caused by Tony B's action.NJ.com: The stuff that Tony's dreams are made of Production * The voice on the other end of the phone in the dream sequence is that of David Chase. * A photo of a deleted scene on the official series website shows that, in the restaurant, Meadow was replaced for a moment by Tracee the murdered Bada Bing stripper, just as Finn was replaced by A.J. References to past episodes * Tony previously dreamed about being in his father's Cadillac (including the blurry background) in the Season 4 episode, \\"Calling All Cars.\\" *When Tony is having sex with Charmaine, she mentions it being better than the sex they had in high school. In the Season 1 episode, \\"Denial, Anger, Acceptance,\\" Charmaine reveals to Carmela that she had sex with Tony. * When Tony wakes up in bed next to Carmine and the phone rings, Carmine says to Tony, \\"answer the fucking thing,\\" which is what Carmine said to Johnny Sack in the episode \\"Fortunate Son\\" when Johnny's cell phone was ringing. * The dream- sequence conversation between Tony and Gloria Trillo (who appeared in \\"He Is Risen,\\" \\"The Telltale Moozadell,\\" \\"Pine Barrens,\\" \\"Amour Fou,\\" \\"Everybody Hurts,\\" and \\"Calling All Cars\\") referred to events that were revealed in earlier episodes: Tony once hit and choked Gloria, Gloria died without having had children, and Tony's mother once threatened to poke out her son's eye with a fork. * The chase scene, in which some men are wearing lederhosen, evokes the angry mob scene in the 1931 James Whale film Frankenstein in which a few men are similarly dessed, and recalls The Sopranos episode \\"Denial, Anger, Acceptance\\" in which Shlomo Teittleman likened Tony to a golem or a Frankenstein; in that same episode Tony tells Dr. Melfi that the analogy bothered him. Other cultural references *The episode makes multiple references to the film The Godfather. Annette Bening speaks the line, \\"I don't want my husband coming out of there with just his cock in his hand,\\" referring to an almost-identical line spoken by Sonny Corleone. Afterwards, Tony's reaching behind the toilet tank for the non-existent gun is a reference to a similar scene with Michael Corleone. When Tony Blundetto shoots Phil Leotardo in Tony Soprano's dream, he exits the same make and brand car (Lincoln Continental) in a similar fashion to Sonny Corleone, during the famous toll- booth shooting scene. * The book that Tony finds in the men's bathroom during his dream is The Valachi Papers, written by Peter Maas; it is the famous book based on the testimony of Joe Valachi, the first member of the Mafia to turn state's evidence and who confirmed the existence of the American Mafia. It is seen again when Tony states he's done his homework. *When Tony calls Aunt Quin from his hotel room, an advertisement for Anne Murray is on the TV. *Lee Harvey Oswald shoots at Tony from an apartment building window, when Tony is running from the angry mob. This is in keeping with his Kennedy interest. *Annette Bening also says about Tony, \\"There's something Bugsy about him.\\" This is a reference to Bugsy Siegel, who was portrayed by Bening's husband Warren Beatty in the film Bugsy; she co-starred in the film as Bugsy's lover. * Phil Leotardo (Frank Vincent) shoots Angelo Garepe in the trunk of his car, which is a bit of an in-joke to his own demise as Billy Batts in Goodfellas. *A scene from the movie Chinatown is showing on the television in the kitchen when Carmela tells Tony they are late to meet Finn's parents. It is then replaced with the ending of the film Scrooge. In Scrooge, the various Ghosts of Christmas Past, Future etc all wordlessly point things out to Ebenezer Scrooge with outheld finger; Carmela, Gloria Trillo, and Coach Molinaro all point things out to Tony in a similar way. *As Tony and Carmela enter Nuovo Vesuvio to meet \\"Finn's parents\\" in Tony's dream, the climactic scene of High Noon is playing on television above the bar. The film stars Gary Cooper, an actor whom Tony repeatedly references throughout the series (notably in the episodes \\"Pilot,\\" \\"Christopher,\\" and \\"The Strong, Silent Type\\") because Tony believes Cooper's strong, silent type demeanor is a trait lacking in today's psychotherapy-driven society. * The episode also makes a series of references to Jackie Gleason, both as a musician and as Ralph Kramden in the 1950s sitcom, The Honeymooners. When Tony and Gloria are talking in Dr. Melfi's office, they jokingly repeat Gleason's catchphrase from the show: 'One of these days, Alice! Pow! Right in the kisser.' The line adroitly references Tony's own physical violence towards Trillo and perhaps suggestively indicates Trillo's own ambivalent attitude towards it, as she too repeats Gleason's phrase. This could also be a glimpse into the meaning of the dream (coming to terms with his cousin's actions) as Tony B frequently quotes Gleason.  Music  *The song played over the end credits is \\"Three Times a Lady\\" by the Commodores. The same song was sung earlier, a cappella, by Vin, during the dinner portion of Tony's dream. *The song that Angelo is listening to on his car radio before he is murdered is \\"Peanuts\\" by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. Frankie Valli's character Rusty Millio is the one that got Angelo involved in the feud with Johnny Sack that led him to be killed. *The piece heard when Tony first walks into the hotel is \\"Clair De Lune\\" (which means \\"moonlight\\" in French) by French composer Claude Debussy. *The music playing when Tony is in Artie's car is \\"Kulun Mankwalesh\\" by Mahmoud Ahmed.

River Sgitheach also known as Skiach or Skiack, (Scottish Gaelic Abhainn Sgitheach, \\"Hawthorn River\\") () is a river in Ross and Cromarty, Scotland. It rises on the southern slopes of Ben Wyvis, passes through Strath Sgitheach, passing Clare plantation, Swordale, the village of Evanton, and after about empties into the Cromarty Firth near the ruin of the old Kiltearn parish church. About a mile to the northeast, on the other side of Balconie Point, the Allt Graad also empties in the Firth. The ruin that lies on the beach between the two rivers is an old salmon fishing bothy of the Novar Estate. During the summer the water level falls but the river remains an obstacle and even at traditional fords it is difficulty to get across with dry feet. There are five bridges: an estate bridge in Strath Sgitheach; the B817 road bridge as the road enters Evanton; the railway bridge; the A9 main road bridge; and a wooden footbridge only 100 yards before the river meets the sea. Evanton waste water treatment plant is on the banks of the river between the A9 and the sea. The river was formerly anglicised as either \\"Skiach\\" or \\"Skiack\\", but the Gaelic spelling is used by the Ordnance Survey name and that of Highland Council. It is pronounced like SKEE-ach. The river game its name to the now-demolished Glenskiach distillery, which was near Milton of Katewell.

The film is a sequel to Species II (1998) and the third installment of the Species series. Directed by Brad Turner and stars Robin Dunne, Robert Knepper, Sunny Mabrey, Amelia Cooke and John Paul Pitoc. Natasha Henstridge, who was contracted to a trilogy commencing with the first Species film, briefly reprises the role of Eve in the opening scene. The film premiered on the American channel Syfy on November 27, 2004 and released on DVD on December 7, 2004, in both a standard and an unrated version. The film was shot in high- definition video. Plot Hours after the events of the previous film, the ambulance transporting the lifeless Eve has lost its way, but when the co- driver tries to radio their superiors, the driver stops and holds him at gunpoint. They are ambushed by the \\"half-breed\\" alien child hiding in the ambulance, who kills the co-driver with his tongue. The driver discovers both the half-breed and Eve in the back of the ambulance; the half-breed strangles Eve to death while she gives birth to a newborn alien, which the driver flees with. Government agent Wasach orders an autopsy, discovering Eve's pregnancy, then has her body burned. The driver, Dr. Bruce Abbot, returns to his usual job teaching biochemistry at a university, where he teaches his belief that it is wrong to decide whether a species should live or die. He raises Eve's child in his home and she grows into a young girl who he names Sara. One night at Abbot's office, he is visited by Patrick Ross' son from the ambulance, who has dramatically aged and is critically ill. While Abbot tries to treat him, Patrick's son demands to see \\"it\\" (Eve's child) and reveals to Abbot that there are other half-breeds suffering from similar illnesses. Afterward, he dies horribly while sitting in the chair. Shocked by these events, Abbot approaches Dean, one of his students whose funding for an experimental power plant project is in jeopardy and asks for his aid in perfecting the alien DNA to save the species. In return, Abbot promises Dean a share of any funding or awards their work receives. In Abbot's absence, Sara pupates inside a cocoon and emerges as an adult. Abbot's superior, Dr. Nicholas Turner, arrives at the house seeking Abbot and comes across Sara, who initially tries to seduce him but then rejects him. He attempts to rape her and Sara kills him. Sara leaves to seek a mate and Abbot returns home, and sees evidence of Sara's transformation and disposes of Turner's body. Sara eventually connects with another half-breed, but discovers his illnesses and knocks his tooth out. As Abbot and Dean continue their experiments on Sara, Dean begins to bond with her. Abbot informs Dean of the government's \\"Project Athena\\", which created Sil in the first film and Sara's heritage as the child of Patrick Ross infected with alien DNA from Mars and Eve, Sil's clone. The half-breed that Sara rejected breaks into the lab, mortally wounds Abbot and attempts to impregnate Sara, but is killed by hydrochloric gas Abbot sprays over the lab. Left alone, Dean ponders whether to continue Abbot's work, and Sara urges him to save her species. Dean's roommate at the university, Hastings, discovers a website posted by a woman named Amelia who wants to date biochemists. After snooping through Dean's notes, he forwards them to Amelia, who agrees to meet him. En route, Amelia - who is another half-breed - has sex with and murders a gas station attendant who attempts to rape her. At the campus, she senses Sara and kidnaps Hastings, taking him to Abbot's home. Both Amelia and Sara force Hastings to work on perfecting the alien DNA using Sara's purer biology to save the half-breeds and create perfect mating partners for them. Agent Wasach, whose team also monitored Amelia's website and discovered its connection to Project Athena, picks up Dean and helps him save Hastings. Dean, Hastings and Wasach flee to Dean's experimental power plant with Sara and Amelia in pursuit. While attempting to keep Sara's harvested eggs away from them, the three decide to try trapping Amelia and Sara in the plant's core, but this tactic risks causing a catastrophic meltdown. Dean drops the eggs into the core, prompting Amelia to attempt to kill him, but Sara attacks her and throws her into the core as well. Dean, Hastings and Wasach manage to close the core in time to prevent a meltdown. Later, Hastings visits Dean at Abbot's home, and discovers both Sara and a half-breed alien boy. Dean reveals that he actually managed to pull Sara to safety before sealing the plant's core, then completed the refined alien DNA to create a mate for her so she would not be alone. After the boy is grown, Dean tells Sara she's on her own and to be careful, but before Sara and her mate leave, Dean asks Sara why she saved him from Amelia when there was no reason to. She does not answer; however, it is implied she has come to care for him. Dean then reassures the nervous Hastings by revealing he ensured Sara's mate would be sterile, preventing them from reproducing.

They decided to cast Sunny Mabrey as the main blonde alien. Amelia Cooke was also taken for the role. Also, Mancuso wanted the creatures to look slightly different from H.R. Giger's original concept. The alien species was then redesigned by Rob Hinderstien. Reception Species III received mostly negative reviews, holding a 33% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 6 reviews. DVD Talk negatively reviewed the film saying \\"this film is underdeveloped with an absurd plot and bad special effects, this film just reuses old ideas and is not worth your time, it is a pointless sequel that lacks an effective story to make it a watchable film, it is just camouflaged by nudity.\\" Den of Geek! said \\"If you are going to start watching this franchise, you should give this one a miss and cut straight to the final film.\\" Sequel A fourth film, Species ‚Äì The Awakening, was released directly to DVD in 2007. While it does continue the Species series, it was a mostly standalone film, not a direct follow-up to the previous film.

It was written and directed by Dan Reed, who made his directorial d√©but, and features Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer. Plot Adam, a 23-year-old self-employed security technician, is hired by a businesswoman, Alice Comfort, to set up a security system in her flat. After finishing the work, Adam falls asleep on a lawnchair on her roof-garden. When Alice arrives home and finds him there, she impulsively asks him to accompany her to a housewarming party for her boss. He is unsure, but eventually agrees. On the way home from the party, Alice and Adam are caught behind a slow-moving vehicle, which Alice frustratedly overtakes whilst Adam shouts out an obscenity at the driver. Shortly thereafter, Alice is distracted from driving and accidentally hits a stag. She brings the car to a stop, and they drag the stag off the road. While they are moving it, the car that Alice had earlier overtaken pulls up behind Alice's car. Three men get out, badly beat Adam and then rape Alice. A month passes, during which Adam and Alice physically heal but both remain emotionally wounded. Upon returning to work, Alice receives notification that, while she was hospitalized following her rape, her father died. Alice drives out to his country estate to put his affairs in order, where she discovers a locked chest that she recognizes from her childhood. On the way home, she passes by a group of riders on horseback, one of whom she recognizes as having raped her. She gets his name - Heffer - from one of the other riders. Alice then contacts Adam, and he makes his way to Alice's father's house where she tells him that she's found one of the men responsible for attacking them. Alice shows Adam the contents of her father's locked chest: a sniper rifle and silencer that her father apparently smuggled home after being discharged from the army. Alice then tells Adam that she intends to avenge herself against Heffer. Adam and Alice go to Heffer's home with the intent to kill him. As Alice is preparing to shoot him, a young woman (later identified as Heffer's daughter, Sophie) comes out of the house, looking for her dog Crisis, who was killed by the duo. Alice and Adam, disturbed by seeing their attacker as a human being, return home. Over the next several days Alice and Adam try to determine if they should follow through with their plan. Adam, who has been impotent since the attack, steadily becomes more aggressive and committed to the idea of murdering Heffer. Alice, however, has grown reluctant to kill Heffer now that she has seen him in a human context; instead, she sends Adam to set up security equipment in Heffer's house in an attempt to determine the identities and locations of his friends who participated in the gang-rape. Adam succeeds in breaking into Heffer's house and ends up in Sophie's room; initially, he merely attempts to keep her quiet so that he can get out of the house, but he has a sudden fit of rage and begins raping her. In the middle of the attack, she escapes from his grasp, and Adam returns home, able to maintain an erection for the first time since the attack. The next day, Alice uses a laptop computer that controls the security cameras and watches Heffer in his house. She realizes his intention is to kill himself and after grabbing the rifle she rushes to his house. Alice finds Heffer in his garage, sitting in his running car, attempting to kill himself with carbon monoxide poisoning. Alice gets Heffer out of the car and into fresh air, saving his life. In the midst of a delirium from the carbon monoxide, Heffer‚Äîwho doesn't recognize Alice‚Äîconfesses that, a month ago, his friends voiced their intentions to rape his daughter, but that he convinced them to rape and beat a woman and her friend in the middle of the road instead. Just then, Alice and Heffer hear Adam calling from outside, and Heffer suddenly turns violent, grabbing her roughly but Alice hits him and frees herself. Adam then bursts into the house, beats Heffer, duct-tapes him to the kitchen table, and holds him down while Alice sodomizes him with the barrel of the rifle that she has fetched from her car; once she is finished, she prepares to kill him, but now feeling pity for him because of the circumstances surrounding the rape, she decides not to pull the trigger. Adam, infuriated, takes out a hunting knife and carves out Heffer's eye. Horrified, Alice runs away; driving back to her father's home, Alice spots Sophie hitch-hiking, and invites her into her car. When Sophie realizes she isn't being taken home, she asks Alice where they're headed; Alice replies, \\"Somewhere safe.\\" Back at Heffer's house, Adam taunts Heffer until he hears a car pulling up; as one of the attackers approaches the house, Adam fatally shoots him in the head before pursuing the remaining attacker through the grounds of Heffer's house. Adam shoots him in the leg as he flees, causing him to fall to the ground. Adam then approaches the wounded man and bludgeons him to death with the butt of the rifle. In the final shot of the film, Adam walks away from his final victim and approaches the screen for a close up shot. He effectively breaks the fourth wall by glancing at the audience - leaving the viewer to reflect on the violent act of revenge Adam has committed.

References  ","title":"Sea chub"},{"id":"4481878","text":"The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck is a children's book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter. It was first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in July 1908. Potter composed the book at Hill Top, a working farm in the Lake District she bought in 1905. Following the purchase, her works began to focus on country and village life, incorporating large casts of animal characters and sinister villains. Jemima Puddle-Duck was the first of her books set wholly at the farm with background illustrations based on the farm buildings and yard, and nearby locales. Jemima is a domestic duck of the Aylesbury breed, whose eggs are routinely confiscated by the farmer's wife because she believes Jemima to be a poor sitter. Jemima searches for a place away from the farm where she can hatch her eggs without human interference, and naively confides her woes to a suave fox who invites her to nest in a shed at his home. Jemima accepts his invitation, little realising her danger: the fox plans to kill and roast her. Kep, a collie on the farm, discovers Jemima's whereabouts and rescues her just in time. Potter indicated the tale was a revision of \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" with Jemima, the fox, and the dog parallels to the fairy tale's heroine, wolf, and woodcutter. Jemima, Kep, the farmer's wife, and her two children were all modelled on real world individuals at Potter's Hill Top farm. The book was hugely popular. Spinoff merchandise included a soft Jemima doll in bonnet and shawl, a Jemima painting book in 1925, and illustrated fabric placemats hand- fashioned by Potter and distributed to friends. Critically, the book is considered one of Potter's best.  Plot  frontispiece depicts Jemima confiding in the fox. Her poke bonnet was not the fashion among farmwomen at the time of the book's publication but its incorporation in the text and illustrations sets the tale in a not-too-distant fairy tale past. The tale begins in a farmyard which is home to a duck called Jemima Puddle-duck. She wants to hatch her own eggs, but the farmer's wife believes ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Jemima tries to hide her eggs, but they are always found and carried away. She sets off along the road in her poke bonnet and shawl to find a safe place away from the farm to lay her eggs. At the top of a hill, she spies a distant wood, flies to it, and waddles about until she discovers an appropriate nesting place among the foxgloves. However, a charming gentleman with \\"black prick ears and sandy-coloured whiskers\\" persuades her to nest in a shed at his home. Jemima is led to his \\"tumble-down shed\\" (which is curiously filled with feathers), and makes herself a nest with little ado. Jemima lays her eggs, and the fox suggests a dinner party to mark the event. He asks her to collect the traditional herbs used in stuffing a duck, telling her the seasonings will be used for an omelette. Jemima sets about her errand, but the farm collie, Kep, meets her as she carries onions from the farm kitchen and asks her what she is doing and where she keeps going. She reveals her errand, Kep sees through the fox's plan at once, and finds out from Jemima where the fox lives. With the help of two fox-hound puppies who are out at walk at the farm, Kep rescues Jemima and the \\"foxy-whiskered gentleman\\" (Mr. Tod) is chased away and seen again in The Tale of Mr. Tod. However, the hungry fox- hounds ate Jemima's eggs. Jemima is escorted back to the farm in tears over her lost eggs, but, in time, lays more eggs and successfully hatches four ducklings.MacDonald 1986, p. 111  Scholarly commentaries  The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck is a tale of pursuit and prey. The theme runs through several of Potter's tales: Mr. McGregor pursues Peter Rabbit, Simpkin lies in wait for the mice in the tailor's shop, and the trout attempts to devour Jeremy Fisher. Potter was following the pattern of fairy tales by dwelling on the theme of pursuit and prey, and often pointed out that the tale of Jemima was a retelling of \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\". Perrault's tale ends with the death of the heroine, but Potter understood children will not tolerate tragedy. The prey in her books survive for better or worse (Peter returns home for a dose of chamomile tea, for example) and, though Jemima loses her eggs to her hungry rescuers, she lives to return to the farm to raise a brood of ducklings.Lane 2001, pp. 126-8 The tale shows Potter at her best in depicting the life of the farm and the village of Near Sawrey, but the tale becomes one of something more than just local colour and interest. The archetypical tale upon which Jemima is based ‚Äì the foolish and naive are rescued from destruction by the loyal and dependable ‚Äì is transformed in Potter's hands to one in which self-preservation and shrewdness become admirable virtues. Graham Greene thought the sandy-whiskered gentleman a character of ominous gloom and suggested Potter had suffered some sort of mental breakdown, but it is more likely she was simply coming to terms with life on a farm. Wild animals invade the precincts of the domesticated ones, and death is part of farming.MacDonald 1986, p. 114 The victor in the tale is the farmer's wife: she regains her errant duck and is rid of the predatory fox. Ostensibly, she confiscates Jemima's eggs believing Jemima will abandon them, but the eggs are not confiscated for the well-being of Jemima and her kin but for the well-being of the farmer's wife and her family: the eggs (or the ducks hatched from them) will end up on their dinner table. In this respect, the farmer's wife is a predator like the fox, but the fox is condemned for his predation. Human values are at the top of the tale's hierarchy. Potter argues for the well- ordered home and the practicalities of farm life over the fantasy lives of animals. It was the modus vivendi Potter was to incorporate in her own life as she devoted more of her thoughts and hours to the business of farming and less to tales of fantasy animals.Kutzer 2003, pp. 105-6, 111 Like many fairy tales, Jemima Puddle-Duck belongs in a remote, but not-too-distant, past. Jemima's shawl reflects the typical farm dress of the Lake District at the time of the tale's composition, but the poke bonnet does not, and the fox's long tail coat and exquisite manners also suggest another time. Jemima is a more interesting character when humanised with the clothing; without it, she is just a farmyard duck. As Potter pointed out, the tale is a revision of a fairy tale and belongs in the indefinite period of \\"once upon a time\\". The story is one of Potter's more ominous and is fraught with tension. Jemima is a headstrong innocent distracted by her overwhelming desire to nest, and thus unable to penetrate the fox's designs and comprehend her dangerous situation. The tension rises in increments from the mysterious feather-filled shed (the place of slaughter), to the fox's plan for an omelette (of Jemima's eggs), to the ultimate horror and crowning irony, Jemima's errand to fetch the herbs that will be used to season herself.MacDonald 1986, pp. 111-2 The fox is the first male villain in Potter's work, saving Samuel Whiskers in The Roly Poly Pudding, the companion piece to Jemima, and, like all villains in Potter, the \\"gentleman with sandy whiskers\\" presents a false social front that conceals his bestial nature. He dresses and behaves as a country gentleman of leisure, idling with a newspaper and living off the labor of others by luring their fowl to his feather-filled shed. Potter had little tolerance for indolence and lack of industry, but, as a country woman, she knew foxes were clever and managed to escape more times than they were caught. From the first encounter between Jemima and the fox, the reader realises the fox is more clever than Jemima and is forced to extend him a grudging admiration.Kutzer 2003, p. 109  Background  Beatrix Potter and Kep (1913) Helen Beatrix Potter was born on 28 July 1866 to barrister Rupert William Potter and his wife Helen (Leech) Potter in London. She was educated by governesses and tutors, and passed a quiet childhood reading, painting, drawing, visiting museums and art exhibitions, and tending a nursery menagerie of small animals. Her interests in the natural world and country life were nurtured with holidays in Scotland, the Lake District, and Camfield Place, the Hertfordshire home of her paternal grandparents.MacDonald 1986, pp. 1-4 Potter's adolescence was as quiet as her childhood. She grew into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed her to be a permanent resident and housekeeper in their home.MacDonald 1986, pp. 6-7 She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six designs of humanised animals to a greeting card publisher.Taylor 1996, pp. 51-2 She hoped to lead a useful life independent of her parents, and tentatively considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community regarded her as an amateur and she abandoned fungi.Taylor 1996, p. 60,67MacDonald 1986, p. 13 Potter had maintained contact with her last governess Annie Carter Moore and had grown fond of her children. Through the 1890s, she sent illustrated story letters to the children. Mrs. Moore recognised the literary and artistic value of the letters and urged her former charge to publish.Lear 2007, p. 142 Potter liked the suggestion, and, in 1900, revised a tale she had written for five-year-old Noel Moore in 1893, and fashioned a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo.Lear 2007, p. 144 Unable to find a buyer for the tale, she published it for family and friends at her own expense in December 1901.Lear 2007, p. 145 House at Hill Top Frederick Warne & Co. had once rejected the tale but, eager to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted the \\"bunny book\\" (as the firm called it) following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke.Lear 2007, pp. 144-7 Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations, chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours,Hobbs 1989, p. 15 and on 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.Taylor 1996, p. 76 Potter continued to publish with Warnes. Early in July 1905 she bought Hill Top, a working farm of at Sawrey in the Lake District with profits from her books and a small legacy from an aunt. On 25 August 1905 Potter's editor and fianc√©, Norman Warne died suddenly and unexpectedly. Potter became deeply depressed and was ill for many weeks,Lane 1978, p. 140 but rallied to complete the last few tales she had planned and discussed with Warne.Lear 2007, p. 206  Production  In 1900 Beatrix Potter revised a tale about a humanised rabbit she had written in 1893, worked up a dummy book in imitation of the small format bestseller Little Black Sambo (1899), and, after multiple rejections from London publishers, privately published her tale in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. was eager to compete in the burgeoning and lucrative small format children's book market, and accepted the \\"bunny book\\" (as the firm called it) after their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke gave it his enthusiastic endorsement.Lear 2007, pp. 144-7 Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations, chose the then-new Hentschel three- colour process for reproducing her watercolours, and in October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released. The Tower Bank Arms, Near Sawrey is just a few hundred yards from Hill Top and was used as a subject for one of Potter's illustrations for the book In the next few years, Potter published books similar in concept, style, or format to Peter Rabbit: The Tailor of Gloucester and The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin in 1903, and the tales of Benjamin Bunny and Two Bad Mice in 1904.MacDonald 1986, Chronology In August 1905, sales profits and a small legacy from an aunt enabled Potter to buy Hill Top, a working farm of 34 acres and 36 perches (13.85 ha) in the Lake District.Lear 2007, p. 237 In the years immediately following its purchase, she produced tales and illustrations inspired by the farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages.MacDonald 1986, p. 75 Potter worked on sketches for Jemima Puddle- Duck during the winter of 1907 while recuperating from respiratory infections. She accompanied her parents on a holiday to Sidmouth in April 1908, and continued to work on Jemima Puddle-Duck. Potter's cousin Caroline Hutton Clark was at Hill Top during the composition of Jemima Puddle-Duck and joined Potter as she searched the farmstead for a suitable place in which to situate Jemima's nest for the illustrations.Lane 2001, pp. 98-9 Kep was a real dog,Taylor 1987, p. 133 and Mrs. Clark was given one of Kep's sons. She later described the puppy as \\"the dearest and cleverest dog I ever had.\\" Two versions of the opening paragraph were written. The slightly cynical, \\"What a gratifying thing it is in these days to meet with a female devoted to family life\\" was revised to read, \\"What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen.\\"Taylor 1987, p. 135 The tale is complicated with irony (the feather-filled shed and the herbs for roasting a duck) and the co- existence of two time sequences or two different points of view: Kep's as he seeks the assistance of the fox-hounds in rescuing Jemima, and the sandy- whiskered gentleman's as he waits nervously for Jemima to return with the herbs.Taylor 1987, p. 134 The \\"farmyard tale\\" was dedicated to Betsy and Ralph Cannon, the children of Potter's farm manager, John Cannon. The children appear in one of the illustrations collecting Jemima's eggs from the rhubarb patch, and their mother is depicted in the opening picture feeding the barnyard fowl. Jemima was based upon a real world duck at Hill Top Farm who evaded Mrs. Cannon and her children in their attempts to locate her eggs before she mismanaged their incubation. Mrs. Cannon believed ducks made poor sitters, and routinely confiscated the ducks' eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Potter may have taken inspiration from a drawing in her father's 1853 sketchbook of a flying duck wearing a bonnet.Taylor 1987, p. 37 Potter almost certainly chose the name \\"Jemima\\" in honour of Jemima Blackburn, an ornithological painter and illustrator whose Birds from Nature she had received as a gift on her tenth birthday and whom she met in 1891.Lear 2008, p. 222 The illustrations depict the new barn and outbuildings at Hill Top, the wrought-iron gate Potter installed at the kitchen garden, the rhubarb patch, the entrance porch at the farmhouse, the exterior of the Tower Bank Arms in the village, and imagined aerial views of the countryside around Near Sawrey.Lear 2008, p. 223 In 1940, Potter remarked upon the illustration of Jemima rushing downhill with her bonnet and shawl askew, \\"That is what I used to look like to the Sawrey people. I rushed about quacking industriously.\\"Lear 2008, p. 428 The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck was published in July 1908 after heated discussions with publisher Harold Warne about the dialogues and cover illustration. The book was an immediate success. In later years, Ernest Aris would blatantly plagiarise not only the Peter Rabbit character in his The Treasure Seekers but Jemima in his Mrs. Beak Duck. Potter was restrained when alerted to the imitations: she praised his technical artistry but chastised him for a lack of originality. At the time, her eyesight was deteriorating and her days were heavily invested in operating her farm; her restraint with Aris may be attributed to her desire to enlist him as a collaborator.Lear 2008, p. 281  Similarities to \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\"  \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" illustration by Walter Crane, 1875. Crane, Randolph Caldecott, and Kate Greenaway were Potter's childhood favourites. Potter indicated Jemima was a revision of \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\", and the similarities between the two are numerous: Jemima and her eggs are substitutes for Red Riding Hood and her grandmother; the farmer's wife and Jemima's sister-in-law Rebeccah are substitutes for Red Riding Hood's mother; the fox and the wolf both conceal their bestial natures beneath the polite behaviour of gentlemen, and the dogs are substitutes for the woodcutters. Both tales touch upon physical appetite, temptation, and foolish behaviour.Kutzer 2003, pp. 107-8 Though the tale has a happy ending, tearful Jemima is led back to the farm in public humiliation after losing her eggs to her hungry rescuers. She is allowed to hatch a brood on the farm, but it only produces four ducklings. Potter's revision of \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" more nearly resembles Perrault's tragic tale than the happily-ever-after Grimm version where the heroine is rescued by woodcutters. The author knew her young audience would sympathise with the unhatched ducklings and would not tolerate having Jemima, a mother figure, suffer a bloody end in the fox's shed. The loss of the eggs is sad for the reader, but Potter ended the tale as happily as possible ‚Äì not only for her audience but for the sake of the real world children of her farm manager, Ralph and Betsy Cannon, to whom the tale was dedicated. Jemima is punished for her headstrong foolishness and must relinquish her hope of finding a nesting spot away from the farm, but the punishment is mitigated when she is allowed to hatch one brood herself.MacDonald 1986, pp. 112-3  Merchandising  Jemima Puddle-Duck was popular, almost as popular as Peter Rabbit, and became the subject of ancillary merchandise. She is depicted in one of the four well known endpapers of the Potter books, and was featured on a Christmas card for the Invalid Children's Aid Association. She became the principal character in an unpublished painting book describing the livestock at Hill Top, and appeared in Peter Rabbit's Painting Book and Tom Kitten's Painting Book before being given her own painting book, Jemima Puddle-Duck's Painting Book in 1925, composed grudgingly in response to public demand for yet another book.Taylor 1987, p. 136 Potter waited for ducklings to hatch at the farm to be used as models for the painting book, but in the end, the eggs were rotten. The instructions in Jemima's painting book were similar to those in Tom Kitten's painting book, but the kittens with crayons in Tom's book accompanying the instructions were replaced by six ducklings splashing about in paint water for the similar page in Jemima's book. In the original tale, Jemima's eggs are eaten by her rescuers but in the painting book, a new design was executed for \\"They took Jemima home\\"; in the painting book, Kep and the fox hound puppies lead Jemima away from her broken but uneaten eggs. The same theme was depicted on Crabtree & Evelyn chocolate Easter eggs. The painting book displays Potter's willingness to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales. The purchaser was alerted to the existence of other Potter books on the inside front cover and directed to a list of books on the back cover.MacDonald 1986, p. 129 Other merchandise included sets of linen or silk placemats painted by Potter for friends with an abridged text and 12 of the illustrations. In 1910, Potter patented a design for a soft toy duck based on her model of Jemima in a Paisley handkerchief shawl and bonnet. A soft Jemima doll was manufactured by J. I. Farnell of Acton.Lear 2008, p. 288 Adaptations *In 1971, the tale became a segment in the Royal Ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter. *In 1992, the tale was telecast as an episode on the animated BBC anthology series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.Taylor 1996, p. 217 *Jemima Puddle-Duck appears in the 2012 CGI animated television series of Peter Rabbit in Nickelodeon. *Jemima Puddle-Duck appears in the 2018 animated/live-action film adaptation of Peter Rabbit, and the sequel voiced by Rose Byrne.

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 24,980. History The first settlement on the site of the future Krasnouralsk was formed in 1832. At first, the residents' forces were directed at satisfying the needs of the factories, the preparation of charcoal. In the 1820s, gold mining began at the Salda River and its sources: more than 100 mines were discovered. In 1843, deposits of copper pyrites were found on the Kushayka River. And in 1875, the development of ore gold began at the mines of the merchant I.P. Bogomolov, whose name was later named the famous copper-pyritic Bogomolovskoye deposit. In 1925, the construction of the country's largest copper smelting plant began on the basis of the Bogomolovsky deposit, in connection with the beginning of development Krasnogvardeysky deposits of copper ore along with which the construction of the eponymous workers' village began. and the construction of smelter, the settlement of Bogomolstroy was founded. In 1929, it was renamed Uralmedstroy (). In 1931, the smelter was commissioned. In 1931, Uralmedstroy was granted work settlement status and renamed Krasnouralsk. Town status was granted in 1932. At the time of commencement of construction, ‚Äúof the residential buildings there were only three houses at the Krasnogvardeisky mine and two houses at Kushayka. At the XVI Party Congress, one of the leaders of the economic complex of the Ural Region V.N. Andronikov complained about pests, in particular, about a delay in launching the Krasnouralsk Combine.XVI Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b), p. 530 Krasnouralsk included the settlement of the metallurgical plant, and two mining villages, Krasnogvardeysky and Novo-Levinsky, located in close proximity. All these villages and industrial facilities (to which the chemical plant under construction should be added) formed a single city. Construction of the modern city The city center was a rectangular factory square formed by Lenin and Kirov streets and stretching from the northwest to the southeast. From the southeast, a three-story factory building and factory walkways entered the square. Around the square, according to the not entirely correct radial beam pattern, there is a factory village built entirely in the 1930s. And almost completely (with the deduction, of course, of a barracks building) preserved to this day, down to utility sheds in the courtyards of two-story buildings. The public infrastructure was located in the southern part of the city in relation to the factory area, along two streets leading to the railway station Copper - Sovetskaya and Kalinin. Here there were a city council, a bank, a technical school, a bathhouse, and a department store. The preserved capital development is represented by two-story as there were no three-story residential buildings in Krasnouralsk, with the exception of a large engineering house in the northern part. It was assumed that the socialist city will be completed simultaneously with the plant.

On November 14, 1931, a large editorial appeared in 'Gigant' newspaper claiming \\"The socialist combine needs a socialist city\\". Determining the urgent tasks of construction. In 1931, it was planned to complete 60 houses, a club, a bathhouse, a public works station and a department store. In 1932, 125 new houses, a sewer, public work station No. 2, two movie clubs, a laundry room, a kitchen factory, hospital campus, several canteens, kindergartens and nurseries). World War II At the beginning of World War II, the construction of a chemical plant began on the territory of Krasnouralsk. On the instructions of the government, in the last month of the summer of 1941, a defense workshop was built, in the walls of which shells were made for Katyusha. Krasnouralsk citizens enriched the country's defense fund by 27 million rubles, which went to the construction of the Krasnouralsky Craftsman and Sovetsky Mednik aircraft, as well as to the Krasnouralsk air connection. Postwar On July 30, 1957, in order to better organize the work of all production links, the Krasnouralsky smelter was established, combining the Krasnouralsk ore management, chemical and copper plants. Georgy Baiderin was put at the head of the plant. In 1993, the city-forming enterprise was transformed into Svyatogor OJSC as part of the UMMC-Holding. On February 1, 1963, the Council of Workers 'Deputies of the city of Krasnouralsk was subordinated to the Sverdlovsk Regional Council of Workers' Deputies..

Born to a Zoroastrian family native to Gilan, Mardavij was an anti-Muslim, who sought to revive the Sasanian Empire which was conquered in the 7th century by the Muslims. He first started his career by joining the army of his kinsman Asfar ibn Shiruya. Mardavij, however, later betrayed and killed him, conquering much of Jibal. He then set out to conquer Hamadan, Dinavar and Isfahan from the Abbasid Caliphate, and thereafter declared himself king of Iran, making Isfahan his capital. He then defeated the Daylamite military leader Makan ibn Kaki, and conquered Tabaristan in 932. By 934, his authority was acknowledged as far as Shiraz and Ahvaz. However, his goal of recreating the Iranian Empire was ruined when he was murdered by his own Turkish slaves in 935. Background Map of northern Iran Mardavij was born ca. 890 in Gilan; he was the son of Ziyar, who belonged to the Shahanshahvand, a royal clan that roamed around Dakhel. Mardavij's mother was a sister of Harusindan, a Gilaki ruler. Mardavij belonged to the Arghich tribe, which claimed to be descended from Arghush Farhadan, king of Gilan who lived during the time of Kay Khosrow. Mardavij grew up in an environment where memories of the glories of the Iranian Empire were alive in the Iranian culture. According to the 10th-century Arab historian al-Masudi, most of the Daylamite and Gilaki leaders, who were Zoroastrian and pagan, had become atheists. Mardavij was one of the many Gilaki leaders that entered into the service of the Alids, once they had established their rule over Tabaristan, Gilan, and Daylam. Rise to power Around 913, Mardavij joined the army of Asfar ibn Shiruya of Lahijan, who served the Zaydids of Tabaristan. In 930, Asfar invaded the domains of the Zaydi Abu Muhammad Hasan ibn Qasim. During the invasion, Mardavij managed to heavily wound Abu Muhammad near Amol, thus avenging his maternal uncle Harusindan, who was killed by the hands of the Alids. The army of Asfar then marched towards Ray, where they defeated the Daylamite general Makan ibn Kaki, who fled to Daylam. Asfar managed to successfully conquer Tabaristan, and also captured Qazvin and Zanjan. He then appointed Mardavij as the governor of Zanjan. In 930, Mardavij, along with Asfar's brother, Shirzad, were ordered to capture Tarom, the capital of the Sallarid ruler Muhammad bin Musafir. During the siege, Mardavij, on the urging of Makan and Muhammad, betrayed Asfar by revolting against him. With the aid of Muhammad and Makan, Mardavij defeated and killed Shirzad, along with other members of his tribe. He then marched towards Qazvin, the residence of Asfar, but Asfar managed to flee. Mardavij thus founded the Ziyarid dynasty and became ruler of Asfar's former territories, which included Ray, Qazvin, Zanjan, Abhar, Qom and Karaj. He is said to have worn a \\"crown of Anushirvan\\" at his court.  Reign  Iran in the mid-10th century In the same year, Makan managed to defeat Mardavij, and briefly recover Tabaristan. Makan then extended his rule over most of Gurgan and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khurasan, which he was forced to abandon in 931, bowing to pressure by the Samanid ruler Nasr II. In 931, Mardavij sent an army against Makan, but the latter defeated Mardavij's forces in a first engagement in 931. Eventually, after Makan's return to Tabaristan from Nishapur, Mardavij personally launched an attack that conquered Tabaristan. Mardavij then aggressively began expanding his domains, by attacking Asfar, who was now residing in Hamadan after his disastrous defeat. In 931, Mardavij managed to defeat and kill Asfar. He then began quickly capturing the Abbasid cities of Hamadan, Dinavar, and Kashan, and finally, Isfahan, which became his capital. He then appointed his brother Vushmgir as the governor of Amol. Mardavij planned to conquer Baghdad, remove the caliphate, be crowned in Ctesiphon and restore the Iranian empire. Just after Mardavij's victory, Ali ibn Buya, along with his two brothers Hasan ibn Buya and Ahmad ibn Buya, defected to Mardavij's side just as he was preparing to campaign to the south of the Alborz mountains as far as Qazvin. Not long afterwards Mardavij granted Ali administrative rule over Karaj, a strategically important town probably situated near modern Bahramabad. While making a stop in Ray on his way to Karaj, however, Ali was warned by Mardavij's vizier al-'Amid that Mardavij was planning to eliminate him. Hurriedly leaving Ray, he arrived at and took over Karaj. In 933, Mardavij made peace with the Samanid ruler Nasr II; Mardavij agreed to cede Gurgan to the Samanids and pay tribute for his possession of Ray. Mardavij then began to focus on western Iran, where his troops managed to conquer as far as Ahvaz, and forced Ali, who was now in Shiraz, to once again acknowledge his authority. Mardavij then had a golden throne with jewels, a tunic, and a golden crown made. His crown was reportedly the same shape of the crown of the Sasanian king Khosrow I. He also had a few silver thrones made for his best generals. Rumours had spread that Mardavij was planning to march to Baghdad and destroy the Abbasid Caliphate, and that he had made an alliance with the Qarmatians of Bahrain. Death In January 935, shortly before Nowruz festivities, Mardavij was assassinated by his Turkish slaves, whom he had treated badly, while favoring his Daylamite/Gilaki troops. After his assassination, many of his troops entered the service of the Abbasids, while some others joined Ali, who founded the Buyid dynasty, and had taken over Mardavij possessions in central and southern Iran. Mardavij's brother Vushmgir succeeded him in northern Iran. Mardavij was buried in Gonbad-e Mardaviz, a place located in the north east of Amin Abbad Borough in the city of Rey, south of Tehran. Legacy Mardavij was one of the most notable figures in northern Iran known for preserving and advocating pre-Islamic Iranian customs. During the Pahlavi era, where interest in pre-Islamic Iran was high, Mardavij appeared as the hero in stories and comic strips of children's magazines in the 1960s.

The van 't Hoff equation has been widely utilized to explore the changes in state functions in a thermodynamic system. The van 't Hoff plot, which is derived from this equation, is especially effective in estimating the change in enthalpy, or total energy, and entropy, or number of accessible microstates, of a chemical reaction. Equation Under standard conditions Under standard conditions, the van 't Hoff equation is where denotes natural logarithm and is the ideal gas constant. This equation is exact at any one temperature. In practice, the equation is often integrated between two temperatures under the assumption that the reaction enthalpy is constant. Since in reality and the reaction entropy do vary with temperature for most processes, the integrated equation is only approximate. A major use of the integrated equation is to estimate a new equilibrium constant at a new absolute temperature assuming a constant standard enthalpy change over the temperature range. To obtain the integrated equation, it is convenient to first rewrite the van 't Hoff equation as : \\\\frac{d \\\\ln K_\\\\mathrm{eq}}{d \\\\frac{1}{T}} = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus}{R}. The definite integral between temperatures and is then :\\\\ln \\\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\\\frac{-\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus}{R} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\\\frac{1}{T_1} \\\\right). In this equation is the equilibrium constant at absolute temperature , and is the equilibrium constant at absolute temperature . Development from thermodynamics Combining the definition of Gibbs free energy: : \\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus = \\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus - T\\\\Delta S^\\\\ominus, where is the entropy of the system, and the Gibbs free energy isotherm equation: :\\\\Delta G^\\\\ominus = -RT \\\\ln K_\\\\mathrm{eq}, we obtain :\\\\ln K_\\\\mathrm{eq} = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus}{RT} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta S^\\\\ominus}{R}. Differentiation of this expression with respect to the variable yields the van 't Hoff equation. Provided that and are constant, the preceding equation gives as a linear function of and hence is known as the linear form of the van 't Hoff equation. Therefore, when the range in temperature is small enough that the standard reaction enthalpy and reaction entropy are essentially constant, a plot of the natural logarithm of the equilibrium constant versus the reciprocal temperature gives a straight line. The slope of the line may be multiplied by the gas constant to obtain the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, and the intercept may be multiplied by to obtain the standard entropy change. van 't Hoff isotherm The Gibbs free energy changes with the temperature and pressure of the thermodynamic system. The van 't Hoff isotherm can be used to determine the Gibbs free energy for non-standard state reactions at a constant temperature: :\\\\left(\\\\frac {dG}{d\\\\xi}\\\\right)_{T,p} = \\\\Delta_\\\\mathrm{r}G + RT \\\\ln Q_\\\\mathrm{r}, where is the Gibbs free energy for the reaction, and is the reaction quotient. When a reaction is at equilibrium, . The van 't Hoff isotherm can help estimate the equilibrium reaction shift. When , the reaction moves in the forward direction. When , the reaction moves in the backwards directions. See Chemical equilibrium. van 't Hoff plot For a reversible reaction, the equilibrium constant can be measured at a variety of temperatures. This data can be plotted on a graph with on the -axis and on the axis. The data should have a linear relationship, the equation for which can be found by fitting the data using the linear form of the van 't Hoff equation :\\\\ln K_\\\\mathrm{eq} = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus}{RT} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta S^\\\\ominus}{R}. This graph is called the van 't Hoff plot and is widely used to estimate the enthalpy and entropy of a chemical reaction. From this plot, is the slope, and is the intercept of the linear fit. By measuring the equilibrium constant, , at different temperatures, the van 't Hoff plot can be used to assess a reaction when temperature changes. Knowing the slope and intercept from the van 't Hoff plot, the enthalpy and entropy of a reaction can be easily obtained using :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta H &= - R \\\\times \\\\text{slope}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta S &= R \\\\times \\\\text{intercept}. \\\\end{align} The van 't Hoff plot can be used to quickly determine the enthalpy of a chemical reaction both qualitatively and quantitatively. Change in enthalpy can be positive or negative, leading to two major forms of the van 't Hoff plot. Endothermic reactions van 't Hoff plot for an endothermic reaction For an endothermic reaction, heat is absorbed, making the net enthalpy change positive. Thus, according to the definition of the slope: :\\\\text{slope} = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H}{R}, for an endothermic reaction, (and the gas constant ), so :\\\\text{slope} = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H}{R} < 0. Thus, for an endothermic reaction, the van 't Hoff plot should always have a negative slope. Exothermic reactions van 't Hoff plot for an exothermic reaction For an exothermic reaction, heat is released, making the net enthalpy change negative. Thus, according to the definition of the slope: :\\\\text{slope} = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H}{R}, from an exothermic reaction, , so :\\\\text{slope} = -\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H}{R} > 0. Thus, for an exothermic reaction, the van 't Hoff plot should always have a positive slope.  Error propagation  Using the fact that , it would appear that two measurements of would suffice to be able to obtain a value of : :\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus = R \\\\frac{\\\\ln K_1 - \\\\ln K_2}{\\\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\\\frac{1}{T_1}}, where and are the equilibrium constant values obtained at temperatures and respectively. The precision of values obtained in this way is highly dependent on the precision of the equilibrium constant values. A typical pair of temperatures might be . For these temperatures :\\\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\\\frac{1}{T_1} = \\\\frac{1}{298} - \\\\frac{1}{308} = 1.1 \\\\times 10^{-4}\\\\text{ K}. Inserting this value into the expression for : :\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus \\\\approx 76 \\\\left(\\\\ln K_1 - \\\\ln K_2\\\\right)\\\\text{ kJ/mol}. Now, error propagation shows that the error on will be about 76 kJ/mol times the error on , or about 110 kJ/mol times the error on the values. Assume for example that the error on each is , a small but reasonable value. The error on will be about . So, even though the individual stability constants were determined with good precision, the enthalpy calculated in this way is subject to a significant error. The entropy will then be obtained from . In this expression the error on the second term is negligible compared to the error on the first term. The magnifying factor is then √∑ 298 K, so for an error of 0.05 in the logarithms the error on will be of the order of . When equilibrium constants are measured at three or more temperatures, values of will be obtained by straight-line fitting. In this case the error on the standard enthalpy will be magnified to a somewhat lesser, but still substantial, extent. Applications of the van 't Hoff plot van 't Hoff analysis van 't Hoff analysis In biological research, the van 't Hoff plot is also called van 't Hoff analysis. It is most effective in determining the favored product in a reaction. Assume two products B and C form in a reaction: :a A + d D ‚Üí b B, :a A + d D ‚Üí c C. In this case, can be defined as ratio of B to C rather than the equilibrium constant. When > 1, B is the favored product, and the data on the van 't Hoff plot will be in the positive region. When < 1, C is the favored product, and the data on the van 't Hoff plot will be in the negative region. Using this information, a van 't Hoff analysis can help determine the most suitable temperature for a favored product. In 2010, a van 't Hoff analysis was used to determine whether water preferentially forms a hydrogen bond with the C-terminus or the N-terminus of the amino acid proline. The equilibrium constant for each reaction was found at a variety of temperatures, and a van 't Hoff plot was created. This analysis showed that enthalpically, the water preferred to hydrogen bond to the C-terminus, but entropically it was more favorable to hydrogen bond with the N-terminus. Specifically, they found that C-terminus hydrogen bonding was favored by 4.2‚Äì6.4 kJ/mol. The N-terminus hydrogen bonding was favored by 31‚Äì43 J/(K mol). This data alone could not conclude which site water will preferentially hydrogen-bond to, so additional experiments were used. It was determined that at lower temperatures, the enthalpically favored species, the water hydrogen-bonded to the C-terminus, was preferred. At higher temperatures, the entropically favored species, the water hydrogen-bonded to the N-terminus, was preferred. Mechanistic studies van 't Hoff plot in mechanism study A chemical reaction may undergo different reaction mechanisms at different temperatures. In this case, a van 't Hoff plot with two or more linear fits may be exploited. Each linear fit has a different slope and intercept, which indicates different changes in enthalpy and entropy for each distinct mechanisms. The van 't Hoff plot can be used to find the enthalpy and entropy change for each mechanism and the favored mechanism under different temperatures. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta H_1 &= - R \\\\times \\\\text{slope}_1, & \\\\Delta S_1 &= R \\\\times \\\\text{intercept}_1; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] \\\\Delta H_2 &= - R \\\\times \\\\text{slope}_2, & \\\\Delta S_2 &= R \\\\times \\\\text{intercept}_2. \\\\end{align} In the example figure, the reaction undergoes mechanism 1 at high temperature and mechanism 2 at low temperature. Temperature dependence Temperature-dependent van 't Hoff plot The van 't Hoff plot is linear based on the tacit assumption that the enthalpy and entropy are constant with temperature changes. However, in some cases the enthalpy and entropy do change dramatically with temperature. A first-order approximation is to assume that the two different reaction products have different heat capacities. Incorporating this assumption yields an additional term in the expression for the equilibrium constant as a function of temperature. A polynomial fit can then be used to analyze data that exhibits a non-constant standard enthalpy of reaction: :\\\\ln K_\\\\mathrm{eq} = a + \\\\frac {b}{T} + \\\\frac {c}{T^2} , where :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta H &= -R \\\\left(b + \\\\frac{2c}{T}\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta S &= R \\\\left(a - \\\\frac{c}{T^2}\\\\right). \\\\end{align} Thus, the enthalpy and entropy of a reaction can still be determined at specific temperatures even when a temperature dependence exists.  Surfactant self-assembly  The van 't Hoff relation is particularly useful for the determination of the micellization enthalpy of surfactants from the temperature dependence of the critical micelle concentration (CMC): :\\\\frac{d}{dT} \\\\ln \\\\mathrm{CMC} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus_\\\\mathrm{m}}{RT^2} . However, the relation loses its validity when the aggregation number is also temperature-dependent, and the following relation should be used instead: :RT^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial T}\\\\ln\\\\mathrm{CMC}\\\\right)_P = -\\\\Delta H^\\\\ominus_\\\\mathrm{m}(N) + T\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial N}\\\\left(G_{N+1} - G_N\\\\right)\\\\right)_{T,P}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial N}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_P, with and being the free energies of the surfactant in a micelle with aggregation number and respectively. This effect is particularly relevant for nonionic ethoxylated surfactants or polyoxypropylene‚Äìpolyoxyethylene block copolymers (Poloxamers, Pluronics, Synperonics). The extended equation can be exploited for the extraction of aggregation numbers of self-assembled micelles from differential scanning calorimetric thermograms.

Born in 1715 and raised in Germany, John Reister moved to America in September 1738. Departing from Rotterdam in the Netherlands and arriving in Philadelphia, Reister originally settled in York, Pennsylvania and began using his background in farming to start earning a living. In 1746 he married a York innkeeper's daughter named Margaret Sohn and moved south into Maryland where he had purchased a tract of land just to the west of modern-day Westminster, Maryland.http://www.bcplonline.org/community/history-reisterstown The Reisters used this land for farming and were able to create a comfortable life for themselves. While living on this farm, the Reisters had their six children John Jr., Mary, Margaret, Catherine, Philip, and Elizabeth. On March 2, 1758 Reister purchased a plot of land to the east of his original property. This land was located at the intersection of several roads that led to Baltimore and points to the north in Pennsylvania. It is believed that Reister decided to purchase this land while traveling along the road on his way to Annapolis. He probably noticed its strategic location and decided to open an inn and tavern for travelers moving along the road. Bench dedicated to Reister in Reisterstown Community Cemetery To meet their farming needs, Reister purchased an additional of land adjoining his property and named it Reister's Desire. By 1785, all of the Reister children had moved out on their own and settled around their father's inn. The town started to grow more rapidly at this point as the Reister children opened up businesses of their own in the surrounding area. John Reister, Jr. was married to Mary Yohn and moved into a house across from the inn where he worked as a blacksmith, carpenter, and a distiller of rye whiskey. Mary Reister also married a blacksmith named John Beckley who began operating in the area. Margaret Reister married Peter Trine, a tanner, and after a short while in the town moved back to York with her husband. Catherine Reister and her husband Roland Smith opened up the \\"Reister Store\\" near the inn and made available many everyday necessities. Philip Reister took over management of the inn with his wife Eve Gardner, and his sister Elizabeth married Henry Weist and opened up a tannery. While the town originally catered to travelers, other businesses were soon attracted to the area and more land was eventually purchased for farming and the planting of an orchard. By 1787, town and state officials began referring to the town officially as Reister‚Äôs Town, and eventually simply Reisterstown. John Reister lived out his life in Reisterstown and died at the age of 89 in 1804.

His master in military matters was the English mercenary John Hawkwood, known in Italy as Giovanni Acuto. Alberico's compagnia fought under the banner of Saint George, as the compagnia San Giorgio.Alberigo da Barbiano, condottiero. Biography Born in Barbiano di Cotignola, a commune of what is now eastern Emilia-Romagna, Alberico was son of Aldisio. The family were nobles of Romagna of long standing, claiming descent from Carolingian times. They were hereditary lords of Barbiano, Cunio and Lugo di Romagna and claimed as kin the lords of Ravenna, Forl√¨ and Carrara. He married Beatrice da Polenta of Ravenna, and had by her two sons, Manfredo and Ludovico. Alberico gained his first military experience in the compagnia of the English captain John Hawkwood, taking part in the famous slaughter at Faenza and the \\"Cesena Bloodbath\\" in the 1370s. Allegedly touched by these excesses, Alberico left the foreign compagnia, deciding to form a military corps constituted only by Italian mercenaries. Barbiano's Compagnia di San Giorgio (\\"St. George Company\\") renovated the military style of the mercenary companies of the period, with sharply improved cavalry armor and tactics, and with a strong attention paid to the training aspect. Famous condottieri like Facino Cane, Jacopo dal Verme, Braccio da Montone and Muzio Attendolo began their military career in the St. George Company. Starting with 200 men, Alberico could soon boast 4,000 soldiers under his command, prompting a quick decline of the foreign companies that had dominated the Italian grounds till that moment. The first condotta (\\"contract\\") for Alberico's force was in 1378, at the service of Barnab√≤ Visconti of Milan, against the Scaliger and the Carraresi. The following year Alberico was called by Pope Urban VI to fight against Antipope Clement VII, the slaughterer at Cesena. The latter's infamous Breton troops were crushed in the neighbourhood of Rome on 29 June 1379, after five hours of battles. Alberico was later involved in the war for the Crown of Naples between Queen Joan I (and her husband Otto of Brunswick) and Charles of Durazzo, backed by Urban VI. On 18 June 1381, Alberico defeated Otto and subsequently besieged Joan in the Castel Nuovo of Naples. After the Queen was captured and imprisoned in the Abruzzi, Barbiano was named gran conestabile (\\"chief of staff\\") by the new king Charles III, and in his new role he had to face Louis I of Anjou, Joan's heir, who had arrived in Italy with an army of 40,000 men. Alberico managed to protect Forl√¨ and Cesena. However, Louis defeated Charles III at Campobasso and was declared king of Naples. Louis eventually died after a pestilence, while Urban VI changed sides declaring Alberico, who was besieging him in Nocera, to be an enemy of the church. Charles was assassinated on 24 February 1386, but Barbiano declared his loyalty to the latter's son Ladislaus. The latter had to face a new French invasion, this time led by Louis II. Alberico for the first time in his career was defeated, at Ascoli Piceno, in 1392. Gian Galeazzo Visconti paid 3,000 florins for his freedom, engaging him for the war against Florence, Bologna and Mantua. During this campaign his brother, Giovanni, was captured and beheaded by the enemy condottiero Astorre I Manfredi. Alberico, eager for vengeance, won a series of battles in 1397 and was ready for the final siege of Mantua. However, a treaty of peace signed by Visconti with Francesco I of Gonzaga stopped him. On 26 June 1402, he defeated a combined Bolognese- Florentine army at the Battle of Casalecchio, leading to the Milanese conquest of Bologna. The following year he left Milan to re-enter service to Ladislaus of Naples. Alberico da Barbiano died in the spring of 1409, on the way to meet his king at Citt√† della Pieve (Umbria). Dynasty His son Ludovico was count of Lugo from 1411. The latter's son Alberico II was ousted from the city in 1431, and moved to Lombardy, where his heirs become feudataries of Belgioioso (current province of Pavia). In 1566 the Barbiano-Belgioioso received the title of \\"Grandees of Spain\\" Cruiser Alberico da Barbiano In 1930 the Italian Regia Marina launched a cruiser Alberico da Barbiano of the Condottieri class.

Cherry is on Richard's shoulders. Richard Kearton FZS, FRPS (2 January 1862 ‚Äì 8 February 1928) and Cherry Kearton (8 July 1871 ‚Äì 27 September 1940), brothers, were a pair of British naturalists and some of the world's earliest wildlife photographers. They developed innovative methods to photograph animals in the wild and in 1895 published the first natural history book to be entirely illustrated by wild photographs. Richard was a made a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London and Royal Photographic Society. Cherry later became a wildlife and news filmmaker, and friend to Theodore Roosevelt. The Royal Geographical Society created the Cherry Kearton Medal and Award in his honour. Biographies Richard and Cherry were born in the village of Thwaite, North Riding of Yorkshire, England, the second and fourth sons parents Mary and John Kearton. Their father was a yeoman farmer. The brothers were educated in Muker and Richard was a farmer in Swaledale, Yorkshire, until 1882, and manager of a publicity department at the publishing house Cassell & Co. until 1898. He married Ellen Rose Cowdrey in 1889 and had three sons and two daughters. Cherry married Mary Burwood Coates in 1900, with whom he had a son, named Edward Cherry, and a daughter, Mary Nina, known as Nina. They divorced in 1920, and he married Ada Forrest, a South African soprano, in 1923. He died in 1940 after reading for the BBC's Children's Hour. The Royal Geographical Society's Cherry Kearton Medal and Award was created in his honour. Photography Cherry Kearton specialised in animal photography, having taken the first ever photograph of a bird's nest with eggs in 1892. In the summer of 1896 he and his brother, a naturalist, reached the Outer Hebridean islands of St Kilda and many other remote places. In 1898 their famous book With Nature and a Camera, illustrated by 160 photographs, was published in London by Cassell. Cherry Kearton contributed photographs to seventeen of Richard Kearton's books, and wrote and illustrated a further seventeen titles of his own. He made the first phonograph recording of birds (a nightingale and a song thrush) singing in the wild in 1900; took the first film of London from the air in 1908, and the first footage of hostilities in the First World War at Antwerp in 1914. Cherry and Richard Kearton are perhaps best remembered for the development of naturalistic photographic hides, including the stuffed ox of 1900 and the stuffed sheep of 1901.Bevis, John (2007) Direct From Nature: The Photographic Work of Richard & Cherry Kearton, Colin Sackett. Films Cherry Kearton filming with aeroscope Cherry and Richard Kearton shot a number of 'shorts' of birds and animals for Charles Urban in the years 1905‚Äì1908. From 1909, Cherry moved into the field of wildlife documentary film making, shot on visits to Africa, India, Borneo, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. He directed more than thirty films for his film companies Cherry Kearton Ltd and Cherry Kearton Films Ltd., including the following: * A Primitive Man's Career to Civilization (1911) * Roosevelt in Africa (1910) * Lassoing Wild Animals in Africa (1910) * Wild Life Across the World (1923) * With Cherry Kearton in the Jungle (1927) * Dassan: An adventure in search of laughter, featuring nature‚Äôs greatest little comedians (1930) * The Big Game of Life (1935) In the beginning, Kearton used a clumsy Kinemascope film camera on tripod, but around 1911 he switched to Aeroscope camera, which led to superior results for this light, one-hand-operated equipment was better suited to wildlife cinematography.

The story is about a tailor whose work on a waistcoat is finished by the grateful mice he rescues from his cat and was based on a real world incident involving a tailor and his assistants. For years, Potter declared that of all her books it was her personal favourite.Lear 162-4  Plot  A tailor in Gloucester sends his cat Simpkin to buy food and a twist of cherry-coloured silk to complete a waistcoat commissioned by the mayor for his wedding on Christmas morning. Whilst Simpkin is gone, the tailor finds mice the cat has imprisoned under teacups. The mice are released and scamper away. When Simpkin returns and finds his mice gone, he hides the twist in anger. The tailor falls ill and is unable to complete the waistcoat, but, upon returning to his shop, he is surprised to find the waistcoat finished. The work has been done by the grateful mice. However, one buttonhole remains unfinished because there was \\"no more twist!\\" Simpkin gives the tailor the twist to complete the work and the success of the waistcoat makes the tailor's fortune.  Composition  In the summer of 1901, Potter was working on The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin, but took time to develop a tale about a poor tailor she heard in the Gloucestershire home of her cousin Caroline Hutton probably in 1897. The tale was finished by Christmas 1901, and given as a Christmas present to ten-year- old Freda Moore, the daughter of her former governess.Lear 156-7Taylor 109 Potter visited a museum to refine her illustrations of eighteenth century dress. The tale was based on a real world incident involving John Prichard (1877‚Äì1934), a Gloucester tailor commissioned to make a suit for the new mayor. He returned to his shop on a Monday morning to find the suit completed except for one buttonhole. A note attached read, \\"No more twist\\". His assistants had finished the coat in the night, but Prichard encouraged a fiction that fairies had done the work and the incident became a local legend.Taylor 108 Although Prichard was a contemporary of Potter's (he was about eleven years her junior and in his twenties when the incident took place), Potter's tailor is shown as \\"a little old man in spectacles, with a pinched face, old crooked fingers,\\" and the action of The Tailor of Gloucester takes place in the 18th century. Potter sketched the Gloucester street where the tailor's shop stood as well as cottage interiors, crockery, and furniture. The son of Hutton's coachman posed as a model for the tailor. In Chelsea, Potter was allowed to sketch the interior of a tailor's shop to whose proprietor she would later send a copy.Lear 157-8 She visited the costume department at the South Kensington Museum to refine her illustrations of 18th century dress.Lear 162-3 Potter later borrowed Freda Moore's gift copy, revised the work, and privately printed the tale in December 1902.Taylor 108-9Lear 158 She marketed the book among family and friends and sent a copy to her publisher who made numerous cuts in both text and illustrations for the trade edition, chiefly among the tale's many nursery rhymes.  Publication history  Squirrel Nutkin was published in August 1903 and Tailor in October 1903. Both were published in deluxe editions bound in a flowered chintz of scattered pansies the author selected. The familiar illustrated endpapers of Potter characters in a chain bordering the edges of the page were introduced in both books against Potter's better judgement. However, Warne was delighted with the commercial potential of the endpapers because new characters hinting at future titles could be worked into the design at any time.  Reception  The mice sewing Potter gave a copy of the book to her Chelsea tailor who, in turn, displayed it to a representative of the trade journal, The Tailor & Cutter. The journal's review appeared on Christmas Eve 1903: > [...] we think it is by far the prettiest story connected with tailoring we > have ever read, and as it is full of that spirit of Peace on Earth, Goodwill > to Men, we are not ashamed to confess that it brought the moisture to our > eyes, as well as the smile to our face. It is got up in choicest style and > illustrated by twenty-seven of the prettiest pictures it is possible to > imagine.Quoted in Lear 165  Adaptations  In 1988, Rabbit Ears Productions produced a storyteller version with narration by Meryl Streep, drawings by David Jorgensen and music by The Chieftains. Ian Holm played the tailor in a live-action TV adaptation in 1989 which included Thora Hird and Jude Law in an early part as the Mayor's stableboy. In 1993, the tale was adapted to animation for the BBC anthology series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends. Derek Griffiths was the voice of Simpkin and Ian Holm the tailor. The episode was dedicated to Dianne Jackson who died of cancer on New Year's Eve 1992.

In particular, it is about the coming of age of the two teenage members of the family despite, or rather through, the troubles that befall them. Wisecracking his way through life until he has eventually reached adulthood, 17-year-old Chris Schwartz has provoked comparison with Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye. Plot summary The Schwartzes live their ordinary lives in the aptly named (and fictional) small town of Bellwether, Connecticut. When she thinks her two children do not need her any longer, Lila Schwartz, a sexually active woman, leaves behind her family, calls herself Lila Munroe and moves to California, where she trains, and later works, as a lawyer. Faced with the dual challenge of having to raise two teenage kids while remaining successful in his demanding job as a publicist and speech writer, Bernard Schwartz more and more relies on medication to cope with everyday life. The real trouble begins when he accidentally swallows two incompatible antidepressants and falls into a coma shortly thereafter. While he is unconscious Bernard Schwartz has a stroke. When he wakes up again he is seriously handicapped--his speech is slurred, his walk is unsteady and his memory is permanently impaired. Similar to a child, he has to learn the meanings of many words. Instead of going to school, Chris teaches his father as best as he can. In spite of his enforced preoccupation with his \\"sleeping\\" father, Chris Schwartz notices that his own life goes on without any major change. Still a virgin, he fantasizes about having sex with Lisa Danmeyer, Bernard's neurologist and actually has his first sexual encounter ever at his father's rehab centre with a sexy speech pathologist who performs fellatio on him. At the same time Cathy, his 16-year- old sister, is on the brink of abandoning her Jewish roots and converting to Roman Catholicism. However, she also develops a crush on Francis Dial, her brother's best friend and classmate. Chris cannot believe that his younger sister might have sex before he does, but in the end this is exactly what happens, an unwanted teenage pregnancy being the result of their union. At first the young lovers are unsure whether Cathy should have an abortion or not, but Cathy soon makes up her mind to keep the baby.

It lies north of the River Forth near to the foot of the Ochil Hills within the Forth Valley. The town is south-west of Alva, north-west of Alloa and east-northeast of Stirling. The town is part of the Clackmannanshire council area. According to a 2012 estimate the population of Tullibody is approximately 8,710 or 9,530 residents including the area of Cambus.  History  There are remains of human activity in the Tullibody area from Mesolithic times. On Braehead Golf Course, the green-keepers found a midden containing shell remains of mussels, scallops and cockles dating back to 4000 BC. Known as The Braehead Shell Midden it is one of the few found on the north side of the Forth. The Haer Stane, now part of Tullibody War Memorial, is said to have formed part of a circle of standing stones. Forth from Colsnaur Hill It is thought that the church in Tullibody dates from the end of the fourth century and St. Serf ministered to the church in the 5th century on his journeys to Alva. Folklore states that Kenneth MacAlpin, King of Scots, amassed his army on Baingle Brae before he fought and subdued the Picts. He is reported to have given Tullibody its name, calling it \\"Tirly-bothy\\" meaning oath of the croft. Certainly there was a standing stone on the main road to Stirling (near the Catholic Church) until the early 1900s when it is then reported to have been demolished to make ready for the road upgrading. An alternative toponymy has been suggested. David I of Scotland was responsible for Tullibody's claim to fame when in 1149 he granted the lands and fishing rights to Cambuskenneth Abbey and it was then that the Auld Kirk was erected, where it still stands today. Hugh de Roxburgh was the rector of Tullibody, Chancellor of Scotland and bishop of Glasgow in the late 12th century. A 19th century map shows the church with the Priest's Well and the Maiden Stone at the graveyard. Edward I of England, in his attempt to subdue the Scots in 1306 reportedly tried to build a castle in Tullibody, on the hill behind the Delph Pond. As it would have been of wooden construction, no one has ever found any proof. In January 1560, William Kirkcaldy of Grange demolished part of Tullibody bridge to delay French troops returning to Stirling Castle. The French commander Henri Cleutin, known as General D'Oysel, took down the roof of the Auld Kirk to repair the bridge. Tullibody, unlike Alloa, had its own Parish Church until the start of the 17th century when it lost its superior status and Alloa became a parish in its own right. Bishop Keith said of Alloa Parish that it \\"swallowed up the mother church\\" at Tullibody. The Abercrombys made The Auld Kirk their family cemetery. In 1600 there were between four and five hundred communicant members, above the age of 16, at the church in Tullibody. In 1645, the Earl of Montrose, on the night before the Battle of Kilsyth, encamped his forces in the woods of Tullibody. A daggered footnote in the Old Statistical Accounts suggests that Montrose was pursued by the Marquis of Lorn who probably camped at the spot now known as Lorn's Hill. One of the earliest maps of the area was made by surveyor and cartographer John Adair in 1681. In 1745 Stirling's Secession preacher Ebenezer Erskine left Stirling which was under the control of the Jacobite army and preached to his people in the wood at Tullibody.  Economy  Tullibody House Tullibody is a former mining town, although neither that industry nor any other major employers have a presence in the town, with many of the residents now commuting to Stirling and Alloa to work. Historically, there was work with wool employing 30‚Äì40 people and a tannery on Alloa Road, which employed 30 to 40 men processing leather and making glue. The site near the Delph Pond, a former curling pond, was demolished, being replaced with new housing in 2017. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, there has been a rapid expansion in housebuilding in the town, with 400 new houses built on the north side of the village in the last 5 years.  Education  The town has four primary schools ‚Äì St. Bernadette's, Abercromby, Banchory and St. Serf's ‚Äì with young people also attending the local high schools including Lornshill Academy, St Modan's High School, Alloa Academy and Alva Academy.  Notable people  William Burns Paterson * Servicemen from Tullibody and Cambus include 27 men from WW1 and 16 from WW2 whose names are recorded on the Tullibody War Memorial. * Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby and his brother, Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, KCB (sometimes spelled Abercrombie) (7 October 1734 ‚Äì 28 March 1801) was a British lieutenant-general noted for his services during the Napoleonic Wars. * Robert Dick (January 1811 ‚Äì 24 December 1866), geologist and botanist was born in Tullibody. * William Burns Paterson (9 February 1850 ‚Äì 16 March 1915) founder of Tullibody Academy and Alabama State University. * Civil engineer Ralph Walker (1749‚Äì1824) was born in Tullibody. In the arts Leaving the Manse (engraving J. M. Corner) based on Quitting The Manse (oil painting G. Harvey) ‚Äì featuring Tullibody Old Kirk Tullibody Old Kirk is depicted in George Harvey's famous work of 1848 Quitting the Manse. The work is rarely on display due to bad bitumen damage caused by Harvey's experiments with varnish. The subject of the painting is a minister and his wife leaving their home in a national event known as The Disruption where around a third of the ministers quit the Church of Scotland protesting that congregations must be able to choose their own minister. This was often done at considerable personal sacrifice as they left their salaries, their homes and sometimes their congregations to set up the Free Church in May 1843. There was a Free Church in Tullibody in the 19th century. Harvey is known to have done many studies for his paintings and Tullibody Church is owned by the Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum. There are at three poems relating to The Maiden's Stone. One is a three-part poem called \\"The Maid of Myreton; A Tale of Tullibody\\". The subject of the poem is a parish priest Peter Beaton who fell in love with Martha, the only child of Wishart, the laird of Myreton. The affair did not end well with her dying of a broken heart but leaving a letter for her father: The letter opened, and thereon was wrote What sort of tomb she wished, the place and spot. \\"Place me,\\" it ran, \\"in coffin made of stone. Nor tree plant near, nor earth be laid thereon, And let the distance be about a perch Before the middle entrance of the church, So that false Beaton, passing out and in. May see the relic of his pride and sin.\\" He saw it not, already he had fled; Another priest read service o'er the dead; And those who sought him, sought him all in vain. He ne'er was seen by living man again. Long, long the church was wrapt in silent gloom, The door built up that faced the Maiden's Tomb; The tomb lies open, empty, broken, marred, In ancient Tullibody's quiet graveyard. There is also a longer poem about the same subject called \\"The Maiden's Stone of Tullibody\\". A third, much shorter, poem called Martha of Myreton comes sandwiched between a poem about the same graveyard and another entitled Tullibody which repeatedly describes Tullibody as sweet. Tullibody, as well as having a famous stone coffin, is also recorded to have had an iron coffin case as an attempt to thwart local body-snatchers. These deterrents were known as mortsafes. Punch magazine ran a poem about an eagle, which threatened a baby in its pram, which could not be diverted even when offered three different kinds of biscuit. A song is recorded in the same volume, called \\"Gently rising Tullibody\\" which praises the town and Abercromby's military victory in Egypt over the French. Yet another poem which mentions Tullibody is from the same book and involves a dialogue between a Besom Cadger and a Fisherwoman. The title is Causey Courtship.

The film was based on the book Amos Judd by John Ames Mitchell.The Young Rajah at silentera.com Plot After fifteen years, Joshua Judd (Charles Ogle) tells his adopted son, Amos (Valentino), that his real father was an Indian maharajah overthrown by Ali Khan (Bertram Grassby). Amos, then a young boy (played by an uncredited Pat Moore), was rescued by General Devi Das Gadi (George Periolat) and taken to America for his safety. (Joshua's merchant brother had been a trusted friend of the late maharajah.) Amos attends Harvard University. There he incurs the hatred of Austin Slade, Jr. (Jack Giddings), whom he beats out for a spot on the rowing team. At a party celebrating a rowing victory over arch-rival Yale, a jealous Slade calls Amos \\"yellow\\" and pours a drink on him, causing Amos to punch him. Slade grabs a chair as a weapon, but Amos ducks, and Slade falls through an open window to his death. Amos is cleared of all wrongdoing, but the newspaper story attracts the notice of Amhad Beg (J. Farrell MacDonald), Ali Khan's Prime Minister. That summer, at a party hosted by close friend Stephen Van Kovert (William Boyd), Amos becomes attracted to one of the other guests, Molly Cabot (Wanda Hawley). By chance, Molly and her family decide to vacation in Amos's hometown. As they become better acquainted, Amos overcomes Molly's initial dislike of him. However, Molly tells her father (Edward Jobson) that she cannot marry someone who is not one of her \\"own people\\", however much she loves him. Instead, she agrees to marry longtime suitor Horace Bennett (Robert Ober), who had been a good friend of Slade's. Bennett tells Amos to stay away from his future wife, but when he also calls Amos a murderer, Amos chokes him into apologizing. As he leaves, Amos is struck in the head by a rock thrown by Bennett. Seeing this, Molly rushes to Amos's side and breaks off her engagement to Bennett. The happy couple decide on an early wedding, but Amos has a vision showing him being murdered the day before. He has had visions before; all came true, even if he tried to prevent them. His family is supposedly descended from Prince Arjuna; the god Krishna granted Arjuna and all his descendants the gift of prophesy. When he reveals this to his future father-in-law (who has already witnessed the accuracy of Amos's visions), the latter suggests he lock himself away in the sanatorium of a friend for the day. Amos does so, but Amhad Beg and his men find and kidnap him. Just as they are about to kill him, Amos is rescued by the mystic Narada (Josef Swickard), who also can see into the future, and his followers. Narada convinces him to forgo his own happiness and return to India to overthrow the tyrant. When Amos is welcomed by his people and the army revolts, Ali Khan commits suicide. The new Maharajah of Dharmagar takes comfort in his latest vision, which shows his wedding to Molly.

The tiger stripes, from lower left to upper right, are the Damascus, Baghdad, Cairo, Alexandria and Camphor sulci. The tiger stripes of Enceladus consist of four sub-parallel, linear depressions in the south polar region of the Saturnian moon. First observed on May 20, 2005 by the Cassini spacecraft's Imaging Science Sub-system (ISS) camera (though seen obliquely during an early flyby), the features are most notable in lower resolution images by their brightness contrast from the surrounding terrain. Higher resolution observations were obtained by Cassini's various instruments during a close flyby of Enceladus on July 14, 2005. These observations revealed the tiger stripes to be low ridges with a central fracture. Observations from the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) instrument showed the tiger stripes to have elevated surface temperatures, indicative of present-day cryovolcanism on Enceladus centered on the tiger stripes.  Names  The name tiger stripes is an unofficial term given to these four features based on their distinctive albedo. Enceladean sulci (subparallel furrows and ridges), like Samarkand Sulci and Harran Sulci, have been named after cities or countries referred to in The Arabian Nights. Accordingly, in November 2006, the tiger stripes were assigned the official names Alexandria Sulcus, Cairo Sulcus, Baghdad Sulcus and Damascus Sulcus (Camphor Sulcus is a smaller feature that branches off Alexandria Sulcus). Baghdad and Damascus sulci are the most active, while Alexandria Sulcus is the least active.  Appearance and geology  Composite map of the southern hemisphere of Enceladus (2007) Images from the ISS camera onboard Cassini revealed the 4 tiger stripes to be a series of sub-parallel, linear depressions flanked on each side by low ridges. On average, each tiger stripe depression is 130 kilometers long, 2 kilometers wide, and 500 meters deep. The flanking ridges are, on average, 100 meters tall and 2‚Äì4 kilometers wide. Given their appearance and their geologic setting within a heavily tectonically deformed region, the tiger stripes are likely to be tectonic fractures. However, their correlation with internal heat and a large, water vapor plume suggests that tiger stripes might be the result of fissures in Enceladus' lithosphere. The stripes are spaced approximately 35 kilometers apart. The ends of each tiger stripe differ in appearance between the anti- Saturnian and sub-Saturnian hemisphere. On the anti-Saturnian hemisphere, the stripes terminate in hook-shaped bends, while the sub-Saturnian tips bifurcate dendritically. Virtually no impact craters have been found on or near the tiger stripes, suggesting a very young surface age. Surface age estimates based on crater counting yielded an age of 4‚Äì100 million years assuming a lunar-like cratering flux and 0.5-1 million years assuming a constant cratering flux.  Composition  Another aspect that distinguishes the tiger stripes from the rest of the surface of Enceladus are their unusual composition. Nearly the entire surface of Enceladus is covered in a blanket of fine-grained water ice. The ridges that surround the tiger stripes are often covered in coarse-grained, crystalline water ice.R. H. Brown et al., Science 311 1425 (2006). This material appears dark in the Cassini camera's IR3 filter (central wavelength 930 nanometers), giving the tiger stripes a dark appearance in clear-filter images and a blue-green appearance in false-color, near-ultraviolet, green, near-infrared images. The Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument also detected trapped carbon dioxide ice and simple organics within the tiger stripes. Simple organic material has not been detected anywhere else on the surface of Enceladus. The detection of crystalline water ice along the tiger stripes also provides an age constraint. Crystalline water ice gradually loses its crystal structure after being cooled and subjected to the Saturnian magnetospheric environment. Such a transformation into finer-grained, amorphous water ice is thought to take a few decades to a thousand years.Cassini Finds Enceladus Tiger Stripes are Really Cubs . Retrieved March 22, 2006.  Cryovolcanism  Enceladus - South Pole - Geyser basin (August 10, 2014). Enceladus - South Pole - Geysers spray water from many locations along the \\"tiger stripes\\". Observations by Cassini during the July 14, 2005 flyby revealed a cryovolcanically active region on Enceladus centered on the tiger stripe region. The CIRS instrument revealed the entire tiger stripe region (south of 70¬∞ South latitude) to be warmer than expected if the region were heated solely from sunlight. Higher resolution observations revealed that the hottest material near Enceladus' south pole is located within the tiger stripe fractures. Color temperatures between 113‚Äì157 kelvins have been obtained from the CIRS data, significantly warmer than the expected 68 kelvins for this region of Enceladus. Data from the ISS, Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS), Cosmic Dust Analyser (CDA) and CIRS instruments show that a plume of water vapor and ice, methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen emanates from a series of jets located within the tiger stripes.NASA's Cassini Images Reveal Spectacular Evidence of an Active Moon. 6 December 2005. Retrieved March 22, 2006. The amount of material within the plume suggests that the plume is generated from a near-surface body of liquid water. Over 100 geysers have been identified on Enceladus. Alternatively, Kieffer et al. (2006) suggest that Enceladus' geysers originate from clathrate hydrates, where carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen are released when exposed to the vacuum of space by the fractures.  Relation to E-Ring of Saturn  Plumes from the moon Enceladus, which seems similar in chemical makeup to comets, have been shown to be the source of the material in the E Ring. The E Ring is the widest and outermost ring of Saturn (except for the tenuous Phoebe ring). It is an extremely wide but diffuse disk of microscopic icy or dusty material. The E ring is distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan. Numerous mathematical models show that this ring is unstable, with a lifespan between 10,000 and 1,000,000 years, therefore, particles composing it must be constantly replenished. Enceladus is orbiting inside this ring, in a place where it is narrowest but present in its highest density, raising suspicion since the 1980s that Enceladus is the main source of particles for the E ring. This hypothesis was confirmed by Cassini's first two close flybys in 2005.

Buried at Gurk Cathedral since 1174, she was beatified on 21 November 1287 and canonised on 5 January 1938 by Pope Pius XI. Her feast day is 27 June. Hemma is venerated as a saint by both the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, and as patroness of the current Austrian state of Carinthia. Biography Little is known about Hemma's descent; she was probably born between 995 and 1000 (other sources mention 980 AD), her ancestors were related to the Bavarian Luitpoldings and thus to Emperor Henry II. Her grandmother Imma (Emma) was vested with market and minting rights at her estates in Lieding (today part of Stra√üburg) by Emperor Otto II in 975. The bestowal raised objections by the Archbishop of Salzburg and the privileges were later transferred to Gurk, Carinthia. According to her hagiography, Hemma was a member of a noble dynasty descending from Pil≈°tanj (Peilenstein) in the Mark an der Sann (in present-day Slovenian Styria) and was brought up at the Imperial court in Bamberg by Empress Saint Cunigunde. Hemma married the Carinthian count William II of Friesach, mentioned as margrave an der Sann in 1016, by whom she had two sons, Hartwig and William. Her husband had received vast estates on the Savinja (Sann) river from the hands of the Emperor. Both her sons and her husband were murdered, Margrave William II probably in 1036 by the deposed duke Adalbero of Carinthia in revenge. Hemma became wealthy through inheritance upon the death of her husband and sons. Countess Hemma used her great wealth for the benefit of the poor and was already venerated as a saint during her lifetime. In addition, she founded ten churches throughout present-day Carinthia, Austria. In 1043 she founded the Benedictine double monastery of Gurk Abbey, where she withdrew during the last years of her life. After her death, Gurk Abbey was dissolved by the Archbishop of Salzburg, Gebhard, who instead used the funds to set up the Diocese of Gurk-Klagenfurt in 1072. Admont Abbey, another Benedictine foundation in Austria, was founded in 1074 by the same Gebhard, and also owes its existence to Hemma's wealth. Since 1174 Hemma's relics have been buried in the crypt of Gurk Cathedral. Emma Pilgrimage Fresco of Saint Hemma in St. Leonard's Parish Church, Nova Cerkev (Municipality of Vojnik, Slovenia) Saint Hemma is the patron saint of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gurk and her intercession is sought for childbirth and diseases of the eye. She is venerated not only in Carinthia (the Austrian state coterminous with the Diocese of Gurk), but also in neighboring Styria (another Austrian state) and Slovenia. From about 300 years ago, the pious and those seeking assistance have been coming to her tomb in Gurk Cathedral, travelling from Carniola over the Loibl Pass. This pilgrimage took place every year on the fourth Sunday after Easter, but fell out of use as a result of the political circumstances of the 20th century. In recent years, however, the routes of pilgrimage from Slovenia and Styria to Gurk have gradually reopened and are becoming increasingly used. Notes References Messner, Sepp, 1995: Hemma von Gurk.

Suddenly, a floating skull character, who is one of the Skull Brothers, captures Judy into a bubble, and sends her and Bub into the air. Two characters named Drunk (from the original Bubble Bobble) follow the skull and take Judy away. Bub turns (or is turned) into a bubble dragon and heads off to rescue his girlfriend. There is also a two-player mode, implying that Bob has suffered the same events as Bub had. However, the manual states that Judy is a friend of both. In the Game Boy version, a character named Robby has to rescue people from a village, who, according to this version's intro, have been captured by a skull character. Gameplay For both the NES and Game Boy versions, the gameplay remains largely unchanged from the other games in the series. However, the player can become able to float up to higher platforms and over walls by holding down the B button. In the NES release, unlike the original Bubble Bobble and many other games in the series, the 2-player mode has players take turns across levels, rather than cooperatively play through them simultaneously. In the NES version only, there are three bonus games which are located after the player defeats a boss, or through a certain door.

The jaw measured 10.5 cm, with an estimated skull of 38.7 cm for the living animal. The teeth possess similarities with that of Scelidosaurus, which approaches it narrowly by the presence of important anterior and posterior basilar points on each tooth. The maxilla was clearly bigger, being the double of the size than the maxilla of Scelidosaurus. Lapparent & Zbyszewski vinculated it originally with Scelidosaurus and assigned the two to Stegosauria, he described that the teeth present were different to Scelidosaurus. Ginsburg cited the specimen and note a bigger size than the holotype of Scelidosaurus.Ginsburg (1964): Discovery of a scelidosaurian (ornithischian dinosaur) in the Upper Triassic of Basutoland. C. R. Acad. Sc. Paris, vol. 258 (24 February 1964). Group 9. Lusitanosaurus was probably a semibipedal to quadrupedal herbivore, with a dense armour on most parts of the body. History of discovery The genus was first described by Albert-F√©lix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyszewski in 1957.A.F. de Lapparent & G. Zbyszewski, 1957, \\"Les dinosauriens du Portugal\\", M√©moires des Services G√©ologiques du Portugal, nouvelle s√©rie 2: 1-63 The type species is Lusitanosaurus liasicus. The generic name is derived from Lusitania, the ancient Latin name for the region. The specific name refers to the Lias. The holotype was part of the collection of the Museu de Hist√≥ria Natural da Universidade de Lisboa. The exact location of the find and the date of collection are unknown, which makes a correct geological dating difficult, but it can be inferred from the matrix rock that it has been discovered near S√£o Pedro de Moel, in strata from the Late Sinemurian (Early Jurassic).Duarte, L.

Classification It was originally assigned to the Stegosauria by de Lapparent, Lusitanosaurus is today considered a basal member of the Thyreophora, perhaps belonging to the Scelidosauridae, but this is tentative, as this family is considered paraphyletic. The fragmentary condition of the specimen does not help to identify it well, as it can be from different grades inside basal Thyreophora, such as a relative of Emausaurus.

Admont Abbey () is a Benedictine monastery located on the Enns River in the town of Admont, Austria. The oldest remaining monastery in Styria, Admont Abbey contains the largest monastic library in the world as well as a long-established scientific collection. It is known for its Baroque architecture, art, and manuscripts. The abbey's location on the borders of the mountainous Ges√§use National Park (the name Admont derives from the Latin expression \\"ad montes,\\" \\"at the mountains\\") is of unusual scenic beauty. History Dedicated to Saint Blaise, Admont Abbey was founded in 1074 by Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg with the legacy of the late Saint Hemma of Gurk, and settled by monks from St. Peter's Abbey in Salzburg under abbot Isingrin. The second abbot, Giselbert, is said to have introduced the Cluniac reforms here. Another of the early abbots, Wolfhold, established a convent for the education of girls of noble family, and the educational tradition has remained strong ever since. The monastery prospered during the Middle Ages and possessed a productive scriptorium. Abbot Engelbert of Admont (1297‚Äì1327) was a famous scholar and author of many works. One of the seven ceiling frescoes painted by Bartolomeo Altomonte in his 80th year for the library. An allegory of the Enlightenment, it shows Aurora, goddess of dawn, with the geniuses of language in her train awakening Morpheus, god of dreaming, a symbol of man. The geniuses are Grammar, Didactic, Greek, Hebrew and Latin. The wars against the Turks and the Reformation (Abbot Valentine was obliged to resign because of his Reformed views) caused a lengthy decline, but with the Counter-Reformation the abbey flourished once again. In addition to the secondary school, which later moved to Judenburg, there were faculties of theology and philosophy. Abbot Albert von Muchar was well known as an historian and taught at the University of Graz. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the abbey reached a high point of artistic productivity, with the works of the world-famous ecclesiastical embroiderer Brother Benno Haan (1631‚Äì1720) and the sculptor Joseph Stammel (1695‚Äì1765). On April 27, 1865, a disastrous fire destroyed almost the entire monastery. While the monastic archives burned, the library could be salvaged. Reconstruction began the following year but was still not complete by 1890.Brockhaus' Konversations-Lexikon. 14th ed., Leipzig, Berlin and Vienna 1894; Vol. 1, p. 152 The economic crises of the 1930s forced the abbey to sell off many of its art treasures, and during the period of the National Socialist government the monastery was dissolved and the monks evicted. They were able to return in 1946 and the abbey today is again a thriving Benedictine community. From 1641, the abbey was a member of the Salzburg Congregation, which in 1930 was merged into the present Austrian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. Abbey church The present church was designed by the architect Wilhelm B√ºcher to replace the former church after the fire of 1865. It is inspired by Regensburg Cathedral and was the first sacred building in Austria in the neo-Gothic style. It incorporates 12th century Romanesque side doors. The two west towers are 67 metres tall, and the facade contains figures of Saint Benedict and Saint Scholastica. The figure of the church's patron, Saint Blaise, tops the pinnacle of the west door. The interior consists of a central aisle and two side aisles, off each of which are five side chapels and six altars. The picture on the altar of Mary, Maria Immaculata by Martino Altomonte (1657‚Äì1745), is surrounded by 15 carved medallions of the secrets of the rosary by Joseph Stammel. Both works of art were created in 1726 and survived the fire of 1856. In a side chapel is located the famous crib of Admont, also by Stammel. It is open to view from 25 December to 2 February. The Gothic crucifix under the triumphal arch dated 1518 is ascribed to Andreas Lackner. A statue of Saint Blaise stands on top of the high altar of white Carrara marble. The choir is decorated with early 18th century tapestries by Benno Haan. In the Chapel of St. Benedict is a Baroque Corpus Christi from the workshop of Johann Meinrad Guggenbichler. Present day The community at Admont consists of over 27 monks under Abbot Bruno Hubl. The abbey is responsible for 27 parishes, runs a secondary school with about 600 pupils and an old people's home in Frauenberg. Its various businesses and enterprises employ about 500 people, and it also has the management of the museums and collections detailed below. Library Admont Abbey Library The library hall, built in 1776 to designs by the architect Joseph Hueber, is 70 metres long, 14 metres wide and 13 metres high, and is the largest monastery library in the world. It contains c. 70,000 volumes of the monastery's entire holdings of c. 200,000 volumes. The ceiling consists of seven cupolas, decorated with frescoes by Bartolomeo Altomonte showing the stages of human knowledge up to the high point of Divine Revelation. Light is provided by 48 windows and is reflected by the original colour scheme of gold and white. The architecture and design express the ideals of the Enlightenment, against which the sculptures by Joseph Stammel of \\"The Four Last Things\\" make a striking contrast. The abbey possesses over 1,400 manuscripts, the oldest of which, from St. Peter's Abbey in Salzburg, were the gift of the founder, Archbishop Gebhard, and accompanied the first monks to settle here, as well as over 900 incunabulae. Burials * Gebhard of Salzburg * Engelbert of Admont * Anastasia of Kiev Museums Natural History Museum Since the Baroque period the abbots had accumulated a collection of \\"curiosities\\" and scientific specimens of various sorts, which were entirely destroyed in the fire of 1865. As part of the reconstruction Father Gabriel Strobl determined to replace the lost collections, and so formed the nucleus of the modern museums. Father Strobl was himself a botanist but also worked on building up the insect collection, so much so that he became one of the great entomologists of his day. The Natural History museum now contains over 250,000 insect specimens, including one of the three largest collections of flies, or Diptera, in Europe. Other collections of, for example, minerals and rock, and exotic species, have also been formed. The abbey also houses two major art collections of Historical and Modern Art. The historical art collection was begun in 1959 by Father Adalbert Krause, and has been significantly augmented since 1980. The present museum was opened in 2003. The collection particularly features ecclesiastical art, and contains for example many works of ecclesiastical embroidery by the famous craftsman Benno Haan and of the abbey sculptor Joseph Stammel. Since 1997 the abbey has also been building up a collection of contemporary art, largely produced by young Austrian artists and often specially designed for the abbey premises.

Like the saxophone it is classifiable as a woodwind rather than brass instrument despite being made of metal, because it has a reed. The folgerphone is a modern experimental instrument, using an alto sax mouthpiece, with copper tubing and a coffee can (the name is a reference to Folgers, a common American brand of canned coffee). The instrument is not commercially produced, but constructed by musicians, and need not use a genuine coffee can, but any sounding box made of metal. Although it uses a sax mouthpiece, it is a cylindrical-bore instrument, and thus part of the clarinet family, but is played with finger holes, like a recorder, rather than with keys like a saxophone or modern clarinet. In the Hornbostel‚ÄìSachs classification system, it is among the 422.211.2 subsection of reed aerophones.  History  The instrument was invented by Nolan Hatcher and Craig Nutt of Alabama (members of the Raudelunas art collective, and the experimental jazz bands the Ron Pates Debonairs and the Blue Denim Deal) at least as early as 1979, when it was used on their duet album Dinosaur Time. It has also been used in recorded experimental and jazz works by others, such as Robert Horton's band Plateau (not to be confused with the Skinny Puppy side-project platEAU), as on the 1990 Arrhythmia compilation CD.

It was released by Frederick Warne & Co. in September 1907. The tale is about manners and how children react to them. Tabitha Twitchit, a cat, invites friends for tea. She washes and dresses her three kittens for the party, but within moments the kittens have soiled and lost their clothes while scampering about the garden. Tabitha is \\"affronted\\". She sends the kittens to bed, and tells her friends the kittens have the measles. Once the tea party is underway however, its \\"dignity and repose\\" are disturbed by the kittens romping overhead and leaving a bedroom in disorder. Potter's career as a children's author and illustrator was launched in 1902 with the release of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She continued to publish, and, in 1905, bought Hill Top, a farm in Lancashire (now Cumbria), with the sales profits from her books and a small legacy from an aunt. Her tales then took inspiration from the farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages. Work began on Tom Kitten in 1906 and its setting became the Hill Top farmhouse. Illustrations depict the interior of the house and the gardens, paths, and gate at the front of the house. Twenty thousand copies of the book were released in September 1907 and another 12,500 the following December. Potter composed a few miniature letters for child friends as if from the characters in the tale, and, in 1917, she released a painting book under Tom Kitten's name. In 1935, two books of piano pieces and piano duets for children were published with one piece inspired by Tom Kitten and another by the Puddle-Ducks. Tom and other characters in the book have become the subjects of a variety of merchandise over the years including porcelain figurines and plush toys. The tale is still in print, and has been translated and published in several languages.  Plot  Tom Kitten, Moppet and Mittens with the Puddle-ducks The tale begins with three feline siblings - Tom Kitten and his sisters Moppet and Mittens - tumbling about the doorstep and playing in the dust. Their mother, Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, expects \\"fine company\\" for tea so she fetches the children indoors to wash and dress them before her friends arrive. Tom is \\"very naughty\\" and scratches his mother while she grooms him. Tabitha dresses Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers, and Tom in \\"all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes\\" taken from a chest of drawers. Tom is fat and bursts several buttons, but his mother sews them back on again. Tabitha turns her kittens into the garden to keep them out of the way while she makes hot buttered toast for the party. She tells them to keep their frocks clean and keep away from the pigsty, the dirty ash pit, Sally Henny Penny, and the Puddle-Ducks, and then returns to her work. Moppet and Mittens soon have their pinafores smeared with grass stains. They climb upon the garden wall and lose some of their clothing in the ascent. Tom has a more difficult time gaining the top of the wall \\"breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left\\". He is disheveled when he reaches the top of the wall, and loses his hat, but his sisters try to pull him together. The rest of his buttons burst. Three Puddle-ducks come marching along the road - \\"pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!\\" Jemima Puddle-duck and Rebeccah put on some of the dropped clothing. The kittens lose the rest of their clothing descending the wall. Moppet invites Mr. Drake Puddle-duck to help dress Tom. He picks up various articles of Tom's clothing and \\"he put[s] them on himself!\\" The three ducks set off up the road just as Tabitha approaches and discovers her three children with no clothes on. She pulls them off the wall, \\"smacks\\" them, and takes them back to the house. \\"My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted!\\" she says. Tabitha sends her kittens upstairs, and tells her guests the kittens are in bed with the measles. However, \\"the dignity and repose of the tea party\\" is disturbed by the \\"very extraordinary noises overhead\\" as the playful kittens romp in a bedroom. An illustration depicts the bedroom in complete disorder and Tom in his mother's bonnet. The next illustration shows Tabitha entering the room. The author interrupts to promise the reader she will make a larger book about Tom some day. In the last pages, the Puddle-ducks have lost the kittens' clothing in a pond, and they have been looking for them ever since.  Scholarly commentaries  Tom Kitten with his mother Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit Ruth K. MacDonald, professor of English at New Mexico State University observes that Tom Kitten is the first of Potter's Sawrey books and introduces characters that would make appearances in the following Sawrey books. Tabitha Twitchit was a longtime resident at Hill Top who kept the rats in check and figures prominently in three of the books and peripherally in another. She is a blend of Potter herself and probably her mother or another proper Victorian lady who resembled her. Inspired by the real Tabitha and a kitten Potter borrowed for the 1906 production of The Story of Miss Moppet, The Tale of Tom Kitten is about how children react to manners. Tom Kitten's very name suggest carefree, mischievous boyishness in the manner of the 19th century's exemplars of boyhood, Tom Sawyer, Ton Aldrich, and Tom Brown. He is unusually defiant of parental strictures and taboos. Tom's mother tries to dignify the rascal by calling him Thomas, dressing him in elegant clothes, and by issuing taboos once he is groomed and dressed to walk upon his hind legs and to stay away from the pig sty, the ash pit and other animals. Not only has Tabitha forced her children into unnatural human clothing but forces them into unnatural postures. However, in the end her efforts are in vain, and Tom and his sisters lose their clothes and remain as carefree and mischievous as ever.  Background  Helen Beatrix Potter was born on 28 July 1866 to barrister Rupert William Potter and his wife Helen (Leech) Potter in London. She was educated by governesses and tutors, and passed a quiet childhood reading, painting, drawing, visiting museums and art exhibitions, and tending a nursery menagerie of small animals. Her interests in the natural world and country life were nurtured with holidays in Scotland, the Lake District, and Camfield Place, the Hertfordshire home of her paternal grandparents.MacDonald 1986, pp. 1-4 Potter's adolescence was as quiet as her childhood. She grew into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed her to be a permanent resident and housekeeper in their home.MacDonald 1986, pp. 6-7 She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six designs of humanized animals to a greeting card publisher.Taylor 1996, pp. 51-2 She hoped to lead a useful life independent of her parents, and tentatively considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community regarded her as an amateur and she abandoned fungi.Taylor 1996, p. 60,67MacDonald 1986, p. 13 Potter had maintained contact with her last governess Annie Carter Moore and had grown fond of her children. Through the 1890s, she wrote the children story and picture letters. Mrs. Moore recognized the literary and artistic value of the letters and urged her former charge to publish.Lear 2007, p. 142 Potter liked the suggestion, and, in 1900, revised a tale she had written for five-year-old Noel Moore in 1893, and fashioned a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo.Lear 2007, p. 144 Unable to find a buyer for the tale, she published it for family and friends at her own expense in December 1901.Lear 2007, p. 145 Frederick Warne & Co. had once rejected the tale but, eager to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted the \\"bunny book\\" (as the firm called it) following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke.Lear 2007, pp. 144-7 Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations, chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours,Hobbs 1989, p. 15 and on 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.Taylor 1996, p. 76 Potter continued to publish with Warnes. Early in July 1905 she bought Hill Top, a working farm of at Sawrey in the Lake District with profits from her books and a small legacy from an aunt. On 25 August 1905 Potter's editor and fianc√©, Norman Warne died suddenly and unexpectedly. Potter became deeply depressed and was ill for many weeks,Lane 1978, p. 140 but rallied to complete the last few tales she had planned and discussed with Warne.Lear 2007, p. 206  Production and release  In 1906, Potter experimented with book formats for babies and very young children just acquiring verbal skills. One of the three books produced during this period was The Story of Miss Moppet, a Victorian moral tale about teasing and its consequences with a kitten as the titular heroine. As the model for Miss Moppet, Potter borrowed a kitten from a mason working at Hill Top and wrote Millie Warne, Norman Warne's sister, \\"I have borrowed a kitten and I am rather glad of the opportunity of working at the drawings. It is very young and pretty and a most fearful pickle.\\" Tom Kitten himself would be created from the drawings Potter had produced during the production of The Story of Miss Moppet.Taylor 1996, p. 109 Potter began work on Tom Kitten in the summer of 1906, and used the gardens and interior of the farmhouse at Hill Top as the setting for the tale. A week after the letter to Millie Warne she wrote her publisher Harold Warne, \\"I have not quite finished the Kitten, it is an exasperating model; and I always find it difficult to settle to work in the country. I hope I have not been inconveniently long about it.\\" Three weeks later, she was on holiday at the rented country estate of Lingholm on the shores of Derwentwater with her parents and wrote, \\"I am wishing most heartily I was back at Sawrey, but I suppose I shall scramble along for a bit here; at all events I must get some drawing done, that kitten book has been sadly neglected.\\" She had taken her drawing and sketching to one of the attics at Lingholm and found the place draughty yet \\"stuffy\\". She missed the sheltered open air and gardening at Hill Top. She was back at Hill Top in October and wrote Millie Warne that she was busy gardening and was stealing garden plants from her neighbours. Tom Kitten was written out in an inexpensive exercise book with the text divided into short paragraphs and 24 pencil sketches pasted in at their corners. Tom's mother, Tabitha Twitchit was named after one of Mrs. Satterthwaite's cats at Belle Green where Potter was staying while alterations were underway at the Hill Top farmhouse.Lear 2007, p. 218 The main street of Near Sawrey photographed by Rupert Potter in May 1913 The illustrations of the garden depict what Potter hoped to see following her labours there, and detail some of the flowers, trees, shrubs, and butterflies Potter described in her letters to Millie Warne. The farmhouse interior and its furnishings are precisely rendered. The entrance porch with its Barthay slate walls, the stone flagged floors, the oak panelling and deep-set windows were all original to the house and faithfully depicted. Potter added her personal furnishings to the illustrations: her flowered washbasin, the cane chair where the kittens sit to be scrubbed, her hall clock and wall mirror. The white wicket gate and the fern covered stone wall are real world details as are the views looking out over Hill Top, Smithy Lane, Stoney Lane winding up to Bank Wood, and the dry stone walls crossing the fields.Lear 2007, p. 219 Some of the pictures of the ducks were made in London. As models, she used ducks belonging to a distant cousin who lived at Putney Park. She wrote to Warne of her pictures, \\"I hope to bring the remaining four in a few days, if I get to Putney again tomorrow. I hope you will like them. I think myself they will lighten up the book. It is a refreshment to do some outdoor sketching again.\\"Linder 1971, p. 186 A pencil sketch illustrating the line \\"[The three Puddle-ducks] stopped and stood in a row, staring up at the kittens\\" depicted the duck on the right facing the other two ducks, apparently in conversation. However when Potter copied her sketch for the book picture she inadvertently turned the duck's head to the right (like the other two ducks) with all three now facing the same direction. Although the kittens are not shown in the picture, the ducks now have their backs to the kittens sitting on the wall and cannot be staring up at them as the line indicates - but only those who are familiar with Sawrey would realize this. Potter made several revisions to her manuscript using strips of paper pasted over lines in the manuscript to indicate her changes. Harold Warne criticized the line \\"all the rest of Tom's clothes came off\\" and thought \\"all\\" should be changed to \\"nearly all\\" but Potter objected: > \\"Nearly all\\" won't do! because I have drawn Thomas already with nothing! > That would not signify: I could give something over but there are not many > garments for Mr. Drake to dress himself in; and it would give the story a > new and criminal aspect if he forcibly took off and stole Tom's trousers. The galley proofs arrived dated 21 February 1907 and Potter carefully read through them, making corrections where necessary and changes where appropriate. Twenty thousand copies were released in September 1907 in a small book format and another 12,500 the following December. Two different bindings were available: one in grey-green paper boards priced at 1/- and a deluxe edition in decorated cloth at 1/6d.Linder 1971, p. 427 The book was dedicated \\"to all Pickles‚Äîespecially those who get upon my garden wall\\". \\"Pickle\\" was Potter's word for mischievous kittens, children, and her exuberant, free- spirited cousin Caroline Hutton. Potter received a copy of the published book and wrote Harold Warne, \\"I am much pleased with Tom Kitten. Some of the pictures are very bad, but the book as a whole is passable, and the ducks help it out.\\"Linder 1971, p. 87Lear 2007, p. 221  Miniature letters  Potter created a series of miniature letters for child fans between 1907 and 1912. These letters were written as from her characters and intended to continue their lives outside their tales. Each letter was folded to represent an envelope, and addressed to the child recipient; there was a tiny stamp in the corner drawn with a red crayon. They were sent to the children in a miniature post bag Potter had made herself or in a bright red toy tin mail box. \\"Some of the letters were very funny,\\" Potter wrote, \\"The defect was that inquiries and answers were all mixed up.\\"Linder 1971, p. 72 Six letters involving the characters from Tom Kitten are extant. Invitations for Christmas Eve \\"Indian corn and dancing\\" were sent from Sally Henny Penny \\"at Home at the Barn Door\\" to Tom, his sisters, and the Puddle-ducks. Tom accepts for his sisters and himself and promises \\"[we] will all come, if our Ma doesn't catch us\\". Rebeccah Puddle-Duck however is \\"laid up with a sore throat\\" and writes Mrs. Ribstone Pippin (from The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan) asking for the loan of a red flannel petticoat to wear as a comforter.

Tom Kitten's Painting Book was published in June 1917 with a cover by Potter depicting Tom standing at an easel, paint brush in hand. It was the second of Potter's three painting books for children, following Peter Rabbit's Painting Book of 1911 and preceding Jemima Puddle-Duck's Painting Book of 1925. The books were composed of pairs of pictures with short, appropriate texts at the foot of each page. When the book was opened, the fully coloured picture on the left page served as a model for the child artist to follow while colouring the outline picture on the right page. Peter Rabbit's book was abridged in 1917, and seven pairs of pictures were cut to create Tom Kitten's Painting Book. One new pair of pictures was added to Tom's book and three new pairs of pictures to Peter's book with the result that there were eight pairs of pictures in both books.Linder 1971, p. 272 Jemima's book would also feature eight pairs of pictures.Linder 1971, p. 273 In addition to painting instructions, Tom's book told the child artist \\"[Y]ou can colour these pictures quite nicely with Crayons.\\" The accompanying illustration depicts three kittens playing about a painting book and several crayons lying on the ground. Two Peter Rabbit music books by Christopher Le Fleming were published in December 1935 under the combined imprint of J. & W. Chester, Ltd. and Frederick Warne & Co. Ltd.. The first book contained six easy piano solos and the second book six easy piano duets. Both books were intended for children aged ten to twelve years. The fifth piece in the book of solos was \\"Tom Kitten\\" and the fourth piece in the duet book was \\"The Puddle- Ducks Take a Walk\\". Potter thought the music charming but too difficult for children to perform. She supplied six illustrations for the first book and twelve for the second book because it was a collection of duets. \\"I have been very long over them,\\" she wrote Le Fleming, \\"Doing them at odd times in a busy season of the year. Some are better or worse than others.\\" She had difficulty with the ducks. \\"The ducks are least satisfactory. I am having another try at Pit Pat Puddle.\\" Chesters assured Potter her preliminary pencil sketches could be reproduced nicely but, in the end, they were inked-over by another artist without Potter's knowledge. She was disappointed with the results. Both volumes were released in paper or board cover formats.Linder 1971, pp. 288-9  Merchandise  Potter asserted her tales would one day be nursery classics, and part of the process in making them so was marketing strategy.MacDonald 1986, p. 128 She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales with spinoffs such as a Peter Rabbit doll, an unpublished Peter Rabbit board game, and Peter Rabbit nursery wallpaper between 1903 and 1905.Lear 2007, pp. 172-5 Similar \\"side-shows\\" (as she termed the spinoffs) were produced with her approval over the following two decades.Taylor 1987, p. 106 After Potter's death in December 1943, Frederick Warne & Co. granted licences to various firms for the production of merchandise based on the Potter characters. Beswick Pottery of Longton, Staffordshire was one of the first and a porcelain figurine of Tom Kitten was one of the first ten Beswick Potter figurines released in 1948. Tabitha Twitchit, Mr. Drake Puddle-Duck, Rebeccah Puddle-Duck, and Mittens and Moppet were released either as single figurines or in combination with other characters. A Tom Kitten mug, plaque, and tableau were issued. In sum, 12 Tom Kitten figurines were released by Beswick between 1948 and 2000.Dubay 2006, pp. 30,35 Crummles of Poole, Dorset began producing small enamelled boxes beginning in 1975. Three boxes had lids depicting characters from Tom Kitten: Tabitha Twitchit scrubbing Moppet's face, the Puddle-Ducks diving for Tom's lost clothes, and an image of Tom Kitten holding his book taken from the book's endpapers.DuBay 2006, pp. 78-9 Tabitha Twitchit sewing Tom Kitten's button on was depicted on the lid of a Huntley & Palmer biscuit tin produced between 1974 and 1978.DuBay 2006, p. 139 Stuffed toy manufacturers had sought licensing rights for the Potter characters as early as 1906, but it was not until the 1970s that an English firm was granted worldwide rights. Their labour-intensive products were unprofitable however, and in 1972, The Eden Toy Company of New York became the exclusive manufacturer of Potter characters. A plush Tom Kitten dressed in his finery was one of the first ten characters released in 1973. He was released as a bean bag in 1999.Dubay 2006, pp. 92-3 Schmid & Co. of Toronto and Randolph, Massachusetts was granted rights to Beatrix Potter in 1977 and produced character-related merchandise over 18 years. In 1977, Tom Kitten was one of the first ten character music boxes released by the company. Another music box featuring Tom and playing \\"My Favorite Things\\" was issued in 1990, and a music box featuring Tabitha Twitchit and playing \\"Lara's Theme\\" was released the same year. In 1983, Tom Kitten was one of the first six flat ceramic Christmas ornaments issued by Schmid. Drake Puddle-duck, Rebeccah Puddle-duck, and Tom with the Butterfly were released in 1984. Scenes from the tales were produced as flat ornaments in 1987 featuring Tom and Moppet, and Drake Puddle-duck in Tom's clothes. In 1991, Schmid manufactured a 3-dimensional Tom Kitten ornament, and in 1992 a Tabitha Twitchit ornament. Another 3-dimensional Tom ornament was released in 1994 before the company closed in 1995.Dubay 2006, pp.106-27  Reprints and translations  As of 2010, all of Potter's 23 small format books remain in print, and available as complete sets in presentation boxes, and as a 400-page omnibus. Tom Kitten is available in an electronic format. The English language editions of Potter's books still bore the Frederick Warne imprint in 2010 though the company was sold to Penguin Books in 1983. All the printing plates for the 23 books were remade from new photographs of the original drawings by Penguin in 1985; the entire Peter Rabbit series was released in 1987 as The Original and Authorized Edition.Taylor 1996, p. 216 Potter's books have been translated into nearly thirty languages, including Greek and Russian. Tom Kitten was released in braille by the Royal Institute for the Blind in 1921 and in the Initial Teaching Alphabet in 1965. The tale was translated and released in Dutch in 1946 as Tom Het Poesje and again in 1970 as Het Verhaal van Poekie Poes. It was released in Danish in 1946 as Tom Kitte, and in French in 1951 as Toto le Minet. Twelve Potter titles including The Tale of Tom Kitten were under licence to Fukuinkan-Shoten of Tokyo, and released in Japanese in the 1970s.Linder 1971, pp. 433-7 In 1986, MacDonald observed that the Potter books had become a traditional part of childhood in both English-speaking lands and those in which the books had been translated.MacDonald 1987, p. 130  Adaptations  * In 1971, the character of Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit appeared in the finale of the Royal Ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter. * In 1992, the tale was adapted, along with The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck, as an episode on the animated BBC anthology series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends. * The character of Jemima Puddle-Duck, along with one of Tom Kitten's sisters, Mittens, appear in the 2012 CGI animated television series of Peter Rabbit in Nickelodeon. * The character of Tom Kitten is set to appear in the film Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway voiced by Damon Herriman.

Precipitation that is not intercepted will fall as throughfall or stemflow on the forest floor. Many methods exist to measure canopy interception. The most often used method is by measuring rainfall above the canopy and subtract throughfall and stem flow (e.g., Helvey and Patric [1965]Helvey, J. D., Patric, J. H., 1965. Canopy and litter interception of rainfall by hardwoods of Eastern United States. Water Resources Research 1 (2), 193‚Äì206.). However, the problem with this method is that the canopy is not homogeneous, which causes difficulty in obtaining representative throughfall data. Another method that tried to avoid this problem is applied by e.g., Shuttleworth et al. [1984],Shuttleworth, W. J., Gash, J. H. C., Lloyd, C. R., Moore, C. J., Roberts, J. M., et.al, 1984.

They covered the forest floor with plastic sheets and collected the throughfall. The disadvantage of this method is that it is not suitable for long periods, because in the end the trees will dry due to water shortage, and the method is also not applicable for snow events. The method by Hancock and Crowther [1979]Hancock, N. H., Crowther, J. M., 1979. A technique for the direct measurement of water storage on a forest canopy. Journal of Hydrology 41, 105‚Äì122. avoided these problems by making use of the cantilever effect of branches. If leaves on a branch hold water, it becomes more heavy and will bend. By measuring the displacement, it is possible to determine the amount intercepted water. Huang et al.Huang, Y. S., Chen, S. S., Lin, T. P., 2005. Continuous monitoring of water loading of trees and canopy rainfall interception using the strain gauge method. Journal of Hydrology 311, 1‚Äì7. refined this method later in 2005 by making use of strain gauges. However, the disadvantages of these methods are that only information about one single branch is obtained and it will be quite laborious to measure an entire tree or forest.

Almost all methods are composed of steroid hormones, although in India one selective estrogen receptor modulator is marketed as a contraceptive. The original hormonal method‚Äîthe combined oral contraceptive pill‚Äîwas first marketed as a contraceptive in 1960. In the ensuing decades many other delivery methods have been developed, although the oral and injectable methods are by far the most popular. Altogether, 18% of the world's contraceptive users rely on hormonal methods. Hormonal contraception is highly effective: when taken on the prescribed schedule, users of steroid hormone methods experience pregnancy rates of less than 1% per year. Perfect-use pregnancy rates for most hormonal contraceptives are usually around the 0.3% rate or less. Currently available methods can only be used by women; the development of a male hormonal contraceptive is an active research area. There are two main types of hormonal contraceptive formulations: combined methods which contain both an estrogen and a progestin, and progestogen-only methods which contain only progesterone or one of its synthetic analogues (progestins). Combined methods work by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus; while progestogen-only methods reduce the frequency of ovulation, most of them rely more heavily on changes in cervical mucus. The incidence of certain side effects is different for the different formulations: for example, breakthrough bleeding is much more common with progestogen-only methods. Certain serious complications occasionally caused by estrogen- containing contraceptives are not believed to be caused by progestogen-only formulations: deep vein thrombosis is one example of this. Medical uses Hormonal contraception is primarily used for the prevention of pregnancy, but is also prescribed for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, and hirsutism. Polycystic ovary syndrome Hormonal treatments, such as hormonal contraceptives, are frequently successful at alleviating symptoms associated with polycystic ovary syndrome. Birth control pills are often prescribed to reverse the effects of excessive androgen levels, and decrease ovarian hormone production. Dysmenorrhea Hormonal birth control methods such as birth control pills, the contraceptive patch, vaginal ring, contraceptive implant, and hormonal IUD are used to treat cramping and pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea. Menorrhagia Oral contraceptives are prescribed in the treatment of menorrhagia to help regulate menstrual cycles and prevent prolonged menstrual bleeding. The hormonal IUD (Mirena) releases levonorgestrel which thins the uterine lining, preventing excessive bleeding and loss of iron. Hirsutism Birth control pills are the most commonly prescribed hormonal treatment for hirsutism, as they prevent ovulation and decrease androgen production by the ovaries. Additionally, estrogen in the pills stimulates the liver to produce more of a protein that binds to androgens and reduces their activity. Effectiveness Modern contraceptives using steroid hormones have perfect-use or method failure rates of less than 1% per year. The lowest failure rates are seen with the implants Jadelle and Implanon, at 0.05% per year. According to Contraceptive Technology, none of these methods has a failure rate greater than 0.3% per year. The SERM ormeloxifene is less effective than the steroid hormone methods; studies have found a perfect-use failure rate near 2% per year. Long-acting methods such as the implant and the IUS are user-independent methods. For user-independent methods, the typical or actual-use failure rates are the same as the method failure rates. Methods that require regular action by the user‚Äîsuch as taking a pill every day‚Äîhave typical failure rates higher than perfect-use failure rates. Contraceptive Technology reports a typical failure rate of 3% per year for the injection Depo-Provera, and 8% per year for most other user-dependent hormonal methods. While no large studies have been done, it is hoped that newer methods which require less frequent action (such as the patch) will result in higher user compliance and therefore lower typical failure rates. Currently there is little evidence that there is an association between being overweight and the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Combined vs. progestogen-only While unpredictable breakthrough bleeding is a possible side effect for all hormonal contraceptives, it is more common with progestogen-only formulations.POP: IUS: Depo-Provera and Jadelle: Implanon: Most regimens of COCPs, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch incorporate a placebo or break week that causes regular withdrawal bleeding. While women using combined injectable contraceptives may experience amenorrhea (lack of periods), they typically have predictable bleeding comparable to that of women using COCPs. Although high-quality studies are lacking, it is believed that estrogen-containing contraceptives significantly decrease the quantity of milk in breastfeeding women. Progestogen-only contraceptives are not believed to have this effect. In addition, while in general the progestogen-only pill is less effective than other hormonal contraceptives, the added contraceptive effect of breastfeeding makes it highly effective in breastfeeding women. While combined contraceptives increase the risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT ‚Äì blood clots), progestogen-only contraceptives are not believed to affect DVT formation. Side effects Cancers *There is a mixed effect of combined hormonal contraceptives on the rates of various cancers, with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) stating: \\"It was concluded that, if the reported association was causal, the excess risk for breast cancer associated with typical patterns of current use of combined oral contraceptives was very small.\\" and also saying that \\"there is also conclusive evidence that these agents have a protective effect against cancers of the ovary and endometrium\\": * The (IARC) notes that \\"the weight of the evidence suggests a small increase in the relative risk for breast cancer among current and recent users\\" which following discontinuation then lessens over a period of 10 years to similar rates as women who never used them, as well as \\"The increase in risk for breast cancer associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives in younger women could be due to more frequent contacts with doctors\\" * Small increases are also seen in the rates of cervical cancer and hepatocellular (liver) tumours. * Endometrial and ovarian cancer risks are approximately halved and persists for at least 10 years after cessation of use; although \\"sequential oral contraceptives which were removed from the consumer market in the 1970s was associated with an increased risk for endometrial cancer\\". * Studies have overall not shown effects on the relative risks for colorectal, malignant melanoma or thyroid cancers. * Information on progesterone-only pills is less extensive, due to smaller sampling sizes, but they do not appear to significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. * Most other forms of hormonal contraception are too new for meaningful data to be available, although risks and benefits are believed to be similar for methods which use the same hormones; e.g., risks for combined- hormone patches are thought to be roughly equivalent to those for combined- hormone pills. Cardiovascular disease Combined oral contraceptives can increase the risk of certain types of cardiovascular disease in women with a pre-existing condition or already-heightened risk of cardiovascular disease. Smoking (for women over 35), metabolic conditions like diabetes, obesity and family history of heart disease are all risk factors which may be exacerbated by the use of certain hormonal contraceptives. Blood clots Hormonal contraception methods are consistently linked with the risk of developing blood clots. However, the risk does vary depending on the hormone type or birth control method being used.  Depression  There is a growing body of research evidence investigating the links between hormonal contraception, and potential adverse effects on women‚Äôs psychological health. Findings from a large Danish study of one million women (followed up from 2000-2013) were published in 2016, and reported that the use of hormonal contraception was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of subsequent depression, particularly amongst adolescents. Within this study, women on the progestogen-only pill in particular, were 34% more likely to be subsequently be given a first diagnosis of depression or to take anti-depressants, in comparison to those not on hormonal contraception. Similarly, in 2018, another large cohort study in Sweden with women aged 12‚Äì30 (n=815,662) found an association between hormonal contraception and subsequent use of psychotropic drugs, particularly amongst adolescents (aged 12‚Äì19). These studies highlight the need for further research into the links between hormonal contraception, and adverse effects on women‚Äôs psychological health. Types There are two main classes of hormonal contraceptives: combined contraceptives contain both an estrogen and a progestin. Progestogen-only contraceptives contain only progesterone or a synthetic analogue (progestin). Also, marketed is ormeloxifene; while not a hormone, ormeloxifene acts on the hormonal system to prevent pregnancy. Combined The most popular form of hormonal contraception, the combined oral contraceptive pill is known colloquially as the pill. It is taken once a day, most commonly for 21 days followed by a seven-day break, although other regimens are also used. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, COCPs may be taken after intercourse as emergency contraception: this is known as the Yuzpe regimen. COCPs are available in a variety of formulations. The contraceptive patch is applied to the skin and worn continuously. A series of three patches are worn for one week each, and then the user takes a one-week break. NuvaRing is worn inside the vagina. A ring is worn for three weeks. After removal, the user takes a one-week break before inserting a new ring. As with COCPs, other regimens may be used with the contraceptive patch or NuvaRing to provide extended cycle combined hormonal contraception. Some combined injectable contraceptives can be administered as one injection per month. Progestogen-only The progestogen only pill (POP) is taken once per day within the same three-hour window. Several different formulations of POP are marketed. A low-dose formulation is known as the minipill. Unlike COCPs, progestogen-only pills are taken every day with no breaks or placebos. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, progestogen-only pills may be taken after intercourse as emergency contraception. There are a number of dedicated products sold for this purpose. Hormonal intrauterine contraceptives are known as intrauterine systems (IUS) or Intrauterine Devices (IUD). An IUS/IUD must be inserted by a health professional. The copper IUD does not contain hormones. While a copper- containing IUD may be used as emergency contraception, the IUS has not been studied for this purpose. Depo Provera is an injection that provides three months of contraceptive protection. Noristerat is another injection; it is given every two months. Contraceptive implants are inserted under the skin of the upper arm, and contain progesterone only. Jadelle (Norplant 2) consists of two rods that release a low dose of hormones. It is effective for five years. Nexplanon has replaced the former Implanon and is also a single rod that releases etonogestrel (similar to the body's natural progesterone). The only difference between Implanon and Nexplanon is Nexplanon is radio opaque and can be detected by x-ray. This is needed for cases of implant migration. It is effective for three years and is usually done in office. It is over 99% effective. It works in 3 ways: 1\\\\. Prevents ovulation- usually an egg does not mature 2\\\\. thickens cervical mucus so to prevent sperm from reaching the egg 3\\\\. If those 2 fail, the last is the progesterone causes the lining of the uterus to be too thin for implantation. Ormeloxifene Ormeloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Marketed as Centchroman, Centron, or Saheli, it is pill that is taken once per week. Ormeloxifene is legally available only in India. Mechanism of action The effect of hormonal agents on the reproductive system is complex. It is believed that combined hormonal contraceptives work primarily by preventing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus. Progestogen-only contraceptives can also prevent ovulation, but rely more significantly on the thickening of cervical mucus. Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation, and its mechanism of action is not well understood. Combined Combined hormonal contraceptives were developed to prevent ovulation by suppressing the release of gonadotropins. They inhibit follicular development and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action. pp. 257‚Äì258: > Mechanism of action > COCs prevent fertilization and, therefore, qualify as contraceptives. There > is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The > progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by > suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens > also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is > enhanced by the estrogen. > Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm > into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial > receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary > mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial > changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly > contribute to the pill's mechanism of action. Progestogen negative feedback decreases the pulse frequency of gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) release by the hypothalamus, which decreases the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and greatly decreases the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in estradiol levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen positive feedback on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation. Estrogen was originally included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby reduce the incidence of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation. Another primary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of sperm penetration through the cervix into the upper genital tract (uterus and fallopian tubes) by decreasing the amount of and increasing the viscosity of the cervical mucus. The estrogen and progestogen in combined hormonal contraceptives have other effects on the reproductive system, but these have not been shown to contribute to their contraceptive efficacy: * Slowing tubal motility and ova transport, which may interfere with fertilization. * Endometrial atrophy and alteration of metalloproteinase content, which may impede sperm motility and viability, or theoretically inhibit implantation. * Endometrial edema, which may affect implantation. Insufficient evidence exists on whether changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective that the possibility of fertilization during combined hormonal contraceptive use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives. Progestogen-only The mechanism of action of progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the progestogen activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives include traditional progestogen-only pills, the subdermal implant Jadelle and the intrauterine system Mirena. These contraceptives inconsistently inhibit ovulation in ~50% of cycles and rely mainly on their progestogenic effect of thickening the cervical mucus and thereby reducing sperm viability and penetration. Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill Cerazette (or the subdermal implant Implanon), allow some follicular development but much more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97‚Äì99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with low dose progestogens. High dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat, completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low dose and intermediate dose progestogens. In anovulatory cycles using progestogen-only contraceptives, the endometrium is thin and atrophic. If the endometrium was also thin and atrophic during an ovulatory cycle, this could theoretically interfere with implantation of a blastocyst (embryo). Ormeloxifene Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation. It has been shown to increase the rate of blastocyst development and to increase the speed at which the blastocyst is moved from the fallopian tubes into the uterus. Ormeloxifene also suppresses proliferation and decidualization of the endometrium (the transformation of the endometrium in preparation for possible implantation of an embryo). While they are believed to prevent implantation rather than fertilization, exactly how these effects operate to prevent pregnancy is not understood  Emergency Contraception  The use of emergency contraceptives (ECs) allows for the prevention of a pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraception failure. In the United States, there are currently four different methods available, including ulipristal acetate (UPA), an oral progesterone receptor agonist- antagonist; levonorgestrel (LNG), an oral progestin; off-label use of combined oral contraceptives (Yuzpe regimen); and the copper intrauterine device (Cu- IUD).  Types  UPA, a progesterone agonist-antagonist, was approved by the FDA in 2010 for use as an EC. UPA acts as a partial agonist and antagonist of the progesterone receptor and works by preventing both ovulation and fertilization. Users of UPA are likely to experience delayed menses after the expected date. In the United States, UPA is sold under the brand name Ella, which is a 30 mg single pill to be taken up to 120 hours after unprotected sex. UPA has emerged as the most effective EC pill, however, the access to UPA is very limited in US cities. UPA is a prescription emergency contraceptive pill and a recent study has found that less than 10% of pharmacies indicated that a UPA prescription could be filled immediately. 72% of pharmacies reported the ability to order UPA and the prescription to be filled in a median wait time of 24 hours. Plan B one step was the first levonorgestrel progestin-only EC approved by the FDA in 1999. Currently, there are many different brands of levonorgestrel EC pills, including Take Action, Next Choice One Dose, and My Way and regimens include a single 1.5 mg pill of levonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel EC pills should be taken up to 72 hours after unprotected sex due to the drug becoming less effective over time. Levonorgestrel acts as an agonist of the progesterone receptor, preventing ovulation. Users of levonorgestrel often experience menses before the expected date. A prescription for levonorgestrel is not needed and can be found over the counter at local pharmacies. Because levonorgestrel does not have any life-threatening side effects, it has been approved by the FDA for use by all age groups. The Yuzpe regimen used combination oral contraceptives for EC and has been used since 1974. This regimen is no longer commonly used due to side effects such as nausea and vomiting, as well as the discovery of more effective methods. The regimen consists of two pills, each containing a minimum 100 Œºg of ethinyl estradiol and a minimum of 500 Œºg of levonorgestrel. The first pill is taken 72 hours after unprotected sex and the second pill is taken 12 hours after the first. The Yuzpe regimen is often used in areas where dedicated EC methods are unavailable or where EC is not accepted. The most effective form of EC is the insertion of a Cu-IUD within 5 days of unprotected sex. Because the Cu-IUD is inserted into the uterus, it has the advantage of providing continued contraception for up to 10 years. Cu-IUDs have been the only IUDs that have been approved as ECs due to the mechanism in hormonal and copper IUDs differing. Hormonal IUDs are used for the treatment of unplanned pregnancies by being placed in the uterus after an oral EC has been taken. Frequency of use Pills‚Äîcombined and progestogen-only‚Äîare the most common form of hormonal contraception. Worldwide, they account for 12% of contraceptive use. 21% of users of reversible contraceptives choose COCPs or POPs. Pills are especially popular in more developed countries, where they account for 25% of contraceptive use. Data from surveys 1997‚Äì2007. Injectable hormonal contraceptives are also used by a significant portion‚Äîabout 6%‚Äîof the world's contraceptive users. See Table 60. Other hormonal contraceptives are less common, accounting for less than 1% of contraceptive use. History In 1921, Ludwig Haberlandt demonstrated a temporary hormonal contraception in a female rabbit by transplanting ovaries from a second, pregnant, animal. By the 1930s, scientists had isolated and determined the structure of the steroid hormones and found that high doses of androgens, estrogens, or progesterone inhibited ovulation. A number of economic, technological, and social obstacles had to be overcome before the development of the first hormonal contraceptive, the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP). In 1957 Enovid, the first COCP, was approved in the United States for the treatment of menstrual disorders. In 1960, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an application that allowed Enovid to be marketed as a contraceptive. The first progestogen-only contraceptive was introduced in 1969: Depo-Provera, a high-dose progestin injection. Over the next decade and a half, other types of progestogen-only contraceptive were developed: a low-dose progestogen only pill (1973); Progestasert, the first hormonal intrauterine device (1976); and Norplant, the first contraceptive implant (1983)., possibly taken from Combined contraceptives have also been made available in a variety of forms. In the 1960s a few combined injectable contraceptives were introduced, notably Injectable Number 1 in China and Deladroxate in Latin America. A third combined injection, Cyclo-Provera, was reformulated in the 1980s by lowering the dose and renamed Cyclofem (also called Lunelle). Cyclofem and Mesigyna, another formulation developed in the 1980s, were approved by the World Health Organization in 1993. NuvaRing, a contraceptive vaginal ring, was first marketed in 2002. 2002 also saw the launch of Ortho Evra, the first contraceptive patch. In 1991, ormeloxifene was introduced as a contraceptive in India. While it acts on the estrogen hormonal system, it is atypical in that it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator rather than an estrogen, and has the capacity for both estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects.

O'Brien. Bread comes to life, spreads its condition throughout the United States, and preys on the living in this eight-minute film. Plot Two people are attacked in a cemetery by slices of bread, which is hurled at them. The people escape in their car as more bread hurls itself at them from offscreen. They make it to a farmhouse where they and others are besieged by rampant slices of killer bread. One person is smothered to death, leaving behind a corpse strewn with white bread. News reports speculate that an explosion at a bakery is animating all manner of bread. During Catholic Mass in an emergency shelter, the worshippers are attacked by Communion wafers. The group in the farmhouse fortify their defences, using toasters (instead of torches) to frighten off the bread, and barricading the doors and windows with sandwich bags (instead of wooden planks). Two women seek refuge in the basement, unaware that there is a lunch bag next to them. The bread inside kills them and one of the men, leaving only one person alive. Meanwhile, the two hamburger buns float away from the women they kill. At the end of the film, the sole survivor is smothered by the bread.

He served as the 21st Governor of the US state of Michigan. Early life in Ohio and Indiana Luce was born in Windsor, Ashtabula County, Ohio to his parents Walter Luce and Mary Gray Luce. Walter Luce, a veteran of the War of 1812 from Tolland, Connecticut, settled in the Connecticut Western Reserve after the war. He and Mary were parents to sons Cyrus Gray, Charles Leverett, and George Lester Luce. When he was twelve years old, young Cyrus moved west with his family to Steuben County, Indiana. After leaving school at seventeen, Cyrus Luce worked from 1841 until 1848 in a woolen mill, carding wool and dressing the unfinished cloth for sale. Life and Politics in Michigan In 1848, Cyrus Luce was a Whig Party candidate for the Indiana House of Representatives for the district including Steuben and DeKalb counties. He lost a close election, and in the same year he purchased of uncultivated land near Gilead, Michigan in Branch County not far from the Indiana state line. Luce cleared the land for farming and in 1849 married Julia A. Dickinson of Gilead. Over time he expanded his landholdings with additional purchases. He became an active member of the Grange in 1874, and remained active in the organization for many years afterwards. In 1852, he was elected to represent Gilead Township on the Branch County Board of Supervisors. In 1854, he was elected as a candidate of the newly formed Republican party to the Michigan State House of Representatives, serving from 1855 to 1856. He was elected Branch County Treasurer in 1858 and again in 1860. In 1864, he was named to fill a seat in the Michigan Senate and was re- elected in 1866. In July, 1879, Luce was appointed State Oil Inspector by Governor Charles Croswell, and re-appointed by Gov. David Jerome in 1881. His first wife Julia died in August 1882, and Luce married Mary Thompson of Bronson, Michigan in November 1883. Running as a Republican party candidate, Luce was elected Governor of Michigan in November 1886, defeating George L. Yaple, taking office on January 1, 1887. He was reelected in 1888 and served two two-year terms. During his tenure, a local liquor option law was sanctioned and a state game warden was established, reportedly the first salaried state game wardenship in the United States. To fill this position Luce appointed William Alden Smith, who would later represent Michigan in the U.S. Senate. Death and legacy Luce died at the age of 80 in Coldwater, Michigan, and is interred in Oak Grove Cemetery adjacent to that municipality. Luce County, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is named for Luce. He was the last governor of the state to have a county named in his honor. His administration was marked by rapid population growth and development in northern Michigan, led by the lumber industry. A state landmark, the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, was built in 1887 during his administration.

A central midfielder, he was also a reliable set piece taker. He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 148 matches and nine goals over 11 seasons, having started his career with Benfica. He also played professionally, albeit with little impact in the countries' top division, in Spain and France. Club career Born in the Lisbon outskirts of Cascais, Leal started his career with local S.L. Benfica and, not yet 17, made his Primeira Liga debut against S.C. Espinho, in a 2‚Äì0 home win on 20 April 1997. He made his breakthrough in the 1998‚Äì99 season, playing 27 league games and scoring three goals; in between, he served a loan stint at Benfica's farm team F.C. Alverca, at the time also in the top level. In the summer of 1999, Leal moved abroad to play for Spain's Atl√©tico Madrid. In his first year the club was relegated to the second division, and in his only goal of the campaign he was also sent off, in a 13 May 2000 home draw against Sevilla FC; he stayed for the following season but could not help the Colchoneros win promotion back into La Liga, although he had established in the starting XI (36 matches, four goals). Leal joined Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in 2001, helping the capital side to two French Cup finals in consecutive years. However, on 8 March 2002, in a match against FC Lorient for that competition, he suffered a serious injury to his left knee, being sidelined for the rest of the campaign after undergoing surgery and also missing that year's UEFA European Under-21 Championship; his playing time was gradually cut, and both the player and the team agreed on an early contract termination on 4 August 2004. In August 2004, Leal signed a four-year contract with FC Porto. He played for six months with the team before moving to Acad√©mica de Coimbra on loan as he did not get enough playing time; at this point, he seriously consider ending his playing career. For 2005‚Äì06, Leal moved to S.C. Braga, but left the club by mutual agreement in January 2007 after only managing 17 league appearances in nearly two seasons. In August, he returned to Lisbon and joined C.F. Os Belenenses in a one-year deal, in another campaign severely cut short due to injuries. In late October 2008, Leal signed a one-year contract with newly promoted C.D. Trofense. After their top division relegation, he returned to Spain after eight years, joining UD Salamanca (also second tier) in a 1+1 deal ‚Äì second year only if promotion was attained. During his only season with the Castile and Le√≥n side, Leal was an undisputed starter, but not only did they not promote but almost suffered relegation. The 30-year-old returned to his country in late July 2010, signing for Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal. In his third game, at former team Benfica, he missed a penalty kick to equalise the score after the opponents had just been reduced to ten men, and Vit√≥ria eventually lost 0‚Äì3. On 5 June 2012, 32-year-old Leal returned to G.D. Estoril Praia after 21 years, agreeing to a one-year deal. In March 2015, following Jos√© Couceiro's departure, both he ‚Äì who worked for his former youth club in the board of directors‚Äì and former assistant Fabiano took the reins until the end of the season, eventually leading the team to the 12th position in the top flight; in July, the former was appointed the sole head coach. International career Leal won one cap for Portugal, aged 18, a 0‚Äì0 draw with the Netherlands in Paris on 19 February 1999. Additionally, he participated with the under-20 team in the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship held in Nigeria, exiting in the round of 16 following a penalty shootout loss to Japan (1‚Äì1 after 120 minutes).

The election was caused by the death of Guy Barnett, Labour Party Member of Parliament for Greenwich on 24 December 1986. Background Labour had held Greenwich since the 1945 general election, although their majority had declined in recent years, and in 1983, Barnett had achieved a majority of only 1,211 votes over the Conservative candidate. The then newly formed Social Democratic Party (SDP) had also stood, winning 25% of the vote. As a result, all three parties considered that they had a chance of taking the seat, but an early opinion poll suggested Labour would win, with the SDP/Alliance in a very poor third place. Candidates The Labour Party selected Deirdre Wood, regarded as a left winger. This laid open the possibility of splitting the vote, as the Labour leadership were moving towards expelling far left MPs and activists identified with the Militant tendency. Although Wood was not a Militant supporter, as a former GLC and sitting ILEA councillor she was close to the London left and she was heavily attacked in the press for her views. In addition, stories about her family background were printed (to her considerable distress); many Labour activists compared her treatment with that of Peter Tatchell at the Bermondsey byelection of four years previously. Despite being the party in power, and on the back of their strong performance in 1983, the Conservatives appeared to have the least chance of taking the seat, but were hopeful of a strong performance in the run-up to the general election and selected John Antcliffe as their candidate. The SDP had formed an alliance with the Liberal Party and could rely on their activists in the constituency canvassing for them. Despite winning 25.4% of the vote in the 1983 election, the Alliance had taken only 23 seats nationwide, and the SDP had not won a by-election since Portsmouth South in 1984. Due to this lacklustre performance, the party had decided to focus on holding neighbouring Woolwich in the forthcoming general election, rather than attempting to win Greenwich. Their original candidate for the seat in the general election withdrew in December 1986, objecting to being a \\"paper candidate\\", and the party instead selected Rosie Barnes, who they ran in the by-election. She had links in the constituency; her husband was a local councillor, who also acted as her election agent. The Liberal Party regarded the constituency as a possible gain for the SDP, and in support of this, flooded the constituency with activists. The Green Party, British National Party, National Front and Revolutionary Communist Party also stood candidates. Comedian Malcolm Hardee also stood, for the Rainbow Alliance \\"Beer, Fags and Skittles Party\\". Campaign An opinion poll in the last week of campaigning suggested that Labour would win, but that the SDP was now a close second and that the Conservatives would be third. This was exactly the result that the SDP/Alliance campaign needed, as it meant that many Conservative voters could be tempted to vote for the SDP in order to defeat Labour. The by-election was held on 26 February 1987. During the afternoon and evening of polling day, SDP/Alliance workers called on known Conservative supporters to remind them that only their candidate could beat Labour. They did so in large numbers and the SDP gained the seat, their first gain from the Labour Party at an election (rather than by defection). Result Aftermath Barnes held the seat at the general election that June, but lost it to Labour in 1992. It revived the SDP before the 1987 election,BBC: Triumphs and Disasters but in retrospect, the campaign could be seen as the 'high water mark' of the Alliance - it would be downhill from here. The SDP failed to make further gains in the 1987 general election, and the majority of the party joined with the Liberals to form the Liberal Democrats. As a result, the election was also the last time the SDP gained a seat.

First published in 2006 by McClelland and Stewart, Book of Longing contains 167 previously unpublished poems and drawings, mostly written at a Zen monastery on Mount Baldy in California, where Cohen lived from 1994 to 1999, and in India, which he visited regularly during the late 1990s. The book also incorporates a number of poems written after his 1978 book, Death of a Lady's Man (not to be confused with his 1977 album, Death of a Ladies' Man). These presumably were left out of his 1984 Book of Mercy, which contained only psalm-like meditations. Book of Longing also collects some of the lyrics to songs from the albums Ten New Songs (2001) and Dear Heather (2004). Many of these poems were first published at The Blackening Pages of The Leonard Cohen Files website. In 2007, the American composer Philip Glass premiered his work Book of Longing. Song Cycle Based on the Poetry and Artwork of Leonard Cohen, in which he set 23 of the book's poems to music. Some poems included Cohen's spoken word. The work was co-commissioned by Luminato Festival under the artistic direction of Chris Lorway in Toronto Canada, Australia's 2008 Adelaide Festival under the artistic direction of Brett Sheehy, and Barbican Centre in London, and premiered at Luminato in 2007. It was subsequently performed at various venues in the United States, Australia, United Kingdom and Europe.

The mind's resilience is evaluated behaviorally, whereas the neuropathological damage is evaluated histologically, although damage may be estimated using blood-based markers and imaging methods. There are two models that can be used when exploring the concept of \\"reserve\\": brain reserve and cognitive reserve. These terms, albeit often used interchangeably in the literature, provide a useful way of discussing the models. Using a computer analogy brain reserve can be seen as hardware and cognitive reserve as software. All these factors are currently believed to contribute to global reserve. Cognitive reserve is commonly used to refer to both brain and cognitive reserves in the literature. In 1988 a study published in Annals of Neurology reporting findings from post- mortem examinations on 137 elderly persons unexpectedly revealed that there was a discrepancy between the degree of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and the clinical manifestations of the disease: some participants whose brains had extensive Alzheimer's disease pathology, had no or very few clinical manifestations of the disease. Furthermore, the study showed that these persons had higher brain weights and greater number of neurons as compared to age-matched controls. The investigators speculated with two possible explanations for this phenomenon: these people may have had incipient Alzheimer's disease but somehow avoided the loss of large numbers of neurons, or alternatively, started with larger brains and more neurons and thus might be said to have had a greater \\"reserve\\". This is the first time this term has been used in the literature in this context. The study sparked off interest in this area, and to try to confirm these initial findings further studies were done. Higher reserve was found to provide a greater threshold before clinical deficit appears. Furthermore, those with higher capacity once they become clinically impaired show more rapid decline, probably indicating a failure of all compensatory systems and strategies put in place by the individual with greater reserve to cope with the increasing neuropathological damage. Brain reserve Brain reserve may be defined as the brain's resilience, its ability to cope with increasing damage while still functioning adequately. This passive, threshold model presumes the existence of a fixed cut-off which, once reached, would inevitably herald the emergence of the clinical manifestations of dementia. Brain size A 1997 study found that Alzheimer's disease pathology in large brains did not necessarily result in clinical dementia. Another study reported head circumference to be independently associated with a reduced risk of clinical Alzheimer's disease. While some studies, like those mentioned, find an association, others do not. This is thought to be because head circumference and other approximations are indirect measures. Number of neuronal connections The number of synapses is lower in early onset dementia than in late onset dementia. This might indicate a vulnerability to the manifestation of clinical cognitive impairment, although there may be other explanations. Structures like the cerebellum contribute to brain reserve. The cerebellum contains the majority of neurons in the brain and participates to both cognitive and motor operations. Cerebellar circuitry is a site of multiple forms of neuronal plasticity, a factor playing a major role in terms of brain reserve. Genetic component of cognitive reserve Evidence from a twin study indicates a genetic contribution to cognitive functions. Heritability estimates have been found to be high for general cognitive functions but low for memory itself. Adjusting for the effects of education 79% of executive function can be explained by genetic contribution.Swan GE, Carmelli D (2002). Evidence for genetic mediation of executive control: a study of aging male twins. Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences. 57(2):P133-43 A study combining twin and adoption studies found all cognitive functions to be heritable. Speed of processing had the highest heritability in this particular study. Cognitive reserve Cognitive reserve also indicates a resilience to neuropathological damage, but the emphasis here is in the way the brain uses its damaged resources. It could be defined as the ability to optimize or maximize performance through differential recruitment of brain networks and/or alternative cognitive strategies. This is an efficiency model, rather than a threshold model, and it implies that the task is processed using less resources or using neural resources more efficiently, resulting in better cognitive performance. Studies use factors like education, occupation, and lifestyle as proxies for cognitive reserve because they tend to positively correlate with higher cognitive reserve. Education and occupation More education and cognitively complex occupation are some of the factors that predict higher cognitive abilities in old age. Therefore, two most commonly used proxies to study cognitive reserve are education and occupation. Education is known to play a role in cognitive decline in normal aging, as well as in degenerative diseases or traumatic brain injuries. A higher prevalence of dementia in individuals with fewer years of education has suggested that education may protect against Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the level of education has a strong impact on adult's lifestyle. Level of education is measured by the number of years an individual spends in school or alternatively, the degree of literacy. Possibly, the level of education itself provides a set of cognitive tools that allow the individual to compensate for the pathological changes. Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire (CRIq), devised to assess the level of cognitive reserve in order to provide better diagnosis and treatment, takes into account years of education and possible training courses lasting at least six months to assess the education load on cognitive reserve. Clinically, education is negatively correlated with dementia severity, but positively correlated with grey matter atrophy, intracranial volume, and overall global cognition. Neurologically, education is correlated to greater functional connectivity between fronto-parietal regions and greater cortical thickness in the left inferior temporal gyrus. In addition to the level of education, it has been shown that bilingualism enhances attention and cognitive control in both children and older adults and delays the onset of dementia. It allows the brain to better tolerate the underlying pathologies and can be considered as a protective factor contributing positively to the cognitive reserve. Another proxy for cognitive reserve is the occupation. Studies suggest that occupation may provide additive and independent source of cognitive reserve throughout person's life. The last or the longest job is usually taken into account. Occupation values may vary in terms of cognitive load involved. Some other common indices, such as prestige or salary can also be considered. Working activity measured by CRIq assesses adulthood professions. There are five different levels of working activities available, differing in the degree of intellectual involvement and personal responsibility. Working activity was recorded as the number of years in each profession over the lifespan. Occupation as a proxy for cognitive reserve is positively correlated with local efficiency and functional connectivity in the right medial temporal lobe. More cognitively stimulating occupations are weakly associated with greater memory, but are more strongly correlated with greater executive functioning. These two proxies are typically measured together and are typically highly correlated with each other. Lifestyle For any given level of clinical impairment, there is a higher degree of neuropathological change in the brains of those Alzheimer's disease sufferers who are involved in greater number of activities. This is true even when education and IQ are controlled for. This suggests that differences in lifestyle may increase cognitive reserve by making the individual more resilient. In other words, everyday experience affect cognition analog to physical exercise influencing musculoskeletal and cardiovascular functions. Using cerebral blood flow as an indirect measure of neuropathological damage, lower CBF indicating more damage, it was found that at a given level of clinical impairment leisure activity score was negatively correlated with CBF. In other words, individuals with greater activity score were able to withstand more brain damage and therefore can be said to have more reserve. Mortimer et al. performed cognitive testing on a population of 678 nuns in 1997, in which they showed that different levels of cognitive activity and performance were possible in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's. One subject showing reduced neocortical plaques survived with mild deficits, despite (or due to) low brain weight.  Lifestyle factors  More recent studies distinguish four modifiable lifestyle factors which influence cognitive health in later life and offer potential to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Between 2011 and 2013 the Cognitive Function and Aging Study Wales (CFAS-Wales) collected data from a cohort of 2,315 cognitively healthy participants aged 65 years and over, not only confirming the theory of impacting lifestyle factors but also detecting a mediating effect of cognitive reserve on the cross-sectional association between lifestyle factors and cognitive function in later life. = Findings = Cognitive and social activity: People with high leisure activity of intellectual (reading magazines or newspapers or books, playing cards, games or bingo, going to classes etc.), social (visiting or being visited by friends or relatives, etc.), engaging (helping others with daily tasks, paid work and volunteer work) nature have a significant smaller risk of developing dementia. Physical activity: Has a strong impact on developing cognitive decline or dementia. Healthy diet: Research on healthy diets emphasizes the benefits of adhering to the Mediterranean-style diet as protection of cognitive health. Alcohol consumption: Studies suggest that light-to-moderate alcohol intake is associated with lower risk (once or twice a week or three or four times a week), as were frequent drinking in earlier life is identified as a risk factor for cognitive decline in later life. Due to the variety of the four lifestyle factors, a lot of different self-report-scales are used to specify the severity of each proxy.  Parkinson's disease  Parkinson's disease is an example for a condition which is associated with the role of cognitive reserve and cognitive impairment. Previous investigation into Parkinson's disease implicated a possible influence of cognitive reserve in the human brain. According to some studies the so-called Cognitive Lifestyle is seen as a general protective factor that can be mediated though several different mechanisms. A study from 2015 included the effects of (cognitive) lifestyle on cross-sectional and longitudinal measures. 525 participants with Parkinson‚Äôs disease completed different baseline assessments of cognition and provided clinical, social and demographic data. After 4 years 323 participated in a cognition assessment in the follow-up. The researchers therefore used the measures of global cognition dementia severity. It has been shown, that next to the educational level and the socio-economic status a higher level of recent social engagement was also associated with a decreased risk of dementia. On the other hand, increasing age and low levels of social engagement may increase the risk of dementia in Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Global reserve In spite of the differences in approach between the models of brain reserve and cognitive reserve, there is evidence that both might be interdependent and related. This is where the computer analogy ends, as with the brain it seems that hardware can be changed by software. Neurotrophic effect of knowledge Exposure to an enriched environment, defined as a combination of more opportunities for physical activity, learning and social interaction, may produce structural and functional changes in the brain and influence the rate of neurogenesis in adult and senescent animal model hippocampi. Many of these changes can be effected merely by introducing a physical exercise regimen rather than requiring cognitive activity per se. In humans, the posterior hippocampi of licensed London taxi drivers was famously found to be larger than that of matched controls, while the anterior hippocampi were smaller. This study shows that people choosing taxi driving as a career (one which has as a barrier to entry‚Äîthe ability to memorize London's streets‚Äîdescribed as \\"the world's most demanding test (of street knowledge)\\") have larger hippocampi, but does not demonstrate change in volume as a result of driving. Similarly, while acquiring a second language requires extensive and sustained cognitive activity, it does not appear to reduce dementia risk compared to those who have not learned another language, although lifelong bilingualism is associated with delayed onset of Alzheimer's disease. Clinical implications The clinical diagnosis of dementia is not perfectly linked to levels of underlying neuropathology. The severity of pathologies and the deficit in cognitive performance could not have direct relationship. The theory of cognitive reserve explains this phenomenon. Katzman et al. (1998) conducted a study on the autopsy results of 10 people and found a pathology related to Alzheimer's disease. However, the same patients showed no symptoms of Alzheimer's disease during their life time. So, when pathology emerges in the brain, cognitive reserve helps to cope with cognitive decline. Thus, individuals with high cognitive reserve cope better than those with low cognitive reserve even if they have the same pathology. This causes people with high cognitive reserve to go un-diagnosed until damage becomes severe. Cognitive reserve, which can be estimated clinically, is affected by many variables. The Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq) measures cognitive reserve under three main sources, namely the education, work activities and leisure time activities throughout the individual's lifespan. It is important to note that cognitive reserve (and the variables associated with it) do not \\"protect\\" from Alzheimer's disease as a disease process‚Äîthe definition of cognitive reserve is based exactly on the presence of disease pathology. This means that the traditional idea that education protects from Alzheimer's disease is false, albeit that cognitive reserve is protective of the clinical manifestations of disease. As of 2010, there was insufficient evidence to recommend any way to increase cognitive reserve to prevent dementia or Alzheimer's. On the other hand, cognitive reserve has a very important impact on neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with high cognitive reserve showed a delay in cognitive decline when compared to patients with low cognitive reserve. However, when the symptoms of cognitive decline become symptomatic, patients with high cognitive reserve show rapid cognitive decline. The presence of cognitive reserve implies that people with greater reserve who already are suffering neuropathological changes in the brain will not be picked up by standard clinical cognitive testing. Conversely anyone who has used these instruments clinically knows that they can yield false positives in people with very low reserve. From this point of view the concept of \\"adequate level of challenge\\" easily emerges. Conceivably one could measure cognitive reserve and then offer specifically tailored tests that would pose enough level of challenge to accurately detect early cognitive impairment both in individuals with high and low reserve. This has implications for treatment and care. In people with high reserve, deterioration occurs rapidly once the threshold is reached. In these individuals and their careers early diagnosis might provide an opportunity to plan future care and to adjust to the diagnosis while they are still able to make decisions. A cognitive rehabilitation study, conducted with dementia patients, showed that patients with low cognitive reserve had better outcomes from cognitive training rehabilitation when compared to high cognitive reserve. This is due to the fact that the patients with high cognitive reserve had delayed cognitive symptoms and therefore the disease could no longer resist the pathology. Furthermore, the improvement seen in the patients with low cognitive reserve indicates that these patients can build their cognitive reserve as a life-long process.

Jahrhundertkulturgueter.kath-orden.at/benediktinererzabtei-st-peter. History St Peter's Abbey was founded in 696 by Saint Rupert at the site of a Late Antique church stemming from the first Christianization in the area in the days of Severinus of Noricum. Likewise the establishment of the monastery was meant to forward the missionary work in the Eastern Alps. Until 987, the office of the abbot was joined to that of the Archbishop of Salzburg: the two were always held together by one man. In the Middle Ages, St Peter's was known for its exceptional writing school. In 1074, Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg sent several monks to the newly established filial monastery of Admont in the March of Styria. In the 15th century, the abbey adopted the Melk Reforms. In 1623, Archbishop Paris Graf von Lodron founded the Benedictine University of Salzburg, which until its dissolution in 1810 was closely connected to the abbey. From 1641, the abbey was a member of the Salzburg Congregation, merged in 1930 into the present Austrian Congregation (of which it is the principal house) of the Benedictine Confederation. In 1926, the endeavours for the establishment of a Catholic university led to the foundation of the Benedictine college (\\"Kolleg St. Benedikt\\"), on which later the re-foundation of the University of Salzburg was based. In 1927, St Peter's was raised to the status of an Archabbey. Upon the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938, the premises were seized and the monks expelled. Nevertheless, the monastery was not dissolved and the monks returned after the war. Abbey church Abbey Church, interior The present-day Romanesque abbey church at the northern foot of the M√∂nchsberg was erected from about 1130 onwards at the site of a previous Carolingian church building, it was dedicated to Saint Peter in 1147. One of the organs had been built on the rood screen in 1444 by Heinrich Traxdorf of Mainz. While the steeple received its onion dome in 1756, the interior, already re-modelled several times, was refurbished in the Rococo style between 1760 and 1782 under Abbot Beda Seeauer by Franz Xaver K√∂nig, Lorenz H√§rmbler, Johann H√∂gler, Benedikt Z√∂pf and others. The high altar is a work by Martin Johann Schmidt. The St Mary's Chapel contains the grave of Abbot Johann von Staupitz (d. 1524), a friend of Martin Luther. Mozart's Great Mass in C minor was scheduled to premiere in the church, probably on 26 October 1783, with his wife Constanze singing first soprano. However, the work remained incomplete. Next to the altar where St. Rupert is entombed lies the tombs of Mozart's sister Maria Anna Mozart (Nannerl), and Johann Michael Haydn. Also entombed at St. Peter's Abbey is St. Vitalis. Library, archives and other collections Library Library St Peter's houses the oldest library in Austria. Among the 800 manuscripts the most precious is the Verbr√ºderungsbuch, which was deposited in 784 by Bishop Virgil. Through continual acquisition, the library has grown to 100,000 volumes, focusing particularly on Benedictine monasticism, medieval church history, history of art, and items relating to the local history of Salzburg, or Salisburgensia. Special collections include incunabula and early editions, graphics including the devotional images collection of Father Gregor Reitlechner and the map collection. In 1768, Abbot Beda Seeauer had the medieval Zellenbibliothek converted to the Rococo style. In 1999, it was restored and is now only accessible by special permission. Archives The archive is for the purposes of abbey administration and the researching of its history. It contains documents from the 8th to the 20th centuries, in the following series: # Deeds: c. 4,300 deeds up to 1700; # Manuscripts Series A: chronicles, journals, chapter minutes, visitations, endowments, necrologies and rolls, inventories, accounts and so on; # Manuscripts Series B: official records of estate ownership (cartularies, registers, feodaries, court records); # Files: records and correspondence of the abbots, the monks, the chancery and other administrative offices of the abbey; files relating to estate ownership; # Other: photographs, maps and plans. Music archive As a result of contact with notable musicians of Salzburg, St Peter's possesses a significant collection, much of it in holograph, with works by Johann Ernst Eberlin, Anton Cajetan Adlgasser, Leopold and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Sigismund von Neukomm, Robert F√ºhrer, and Karl Santner. Other collections The abbey also owns collections of paintings, church treasures, artworks, minerals, furniture, musical instruments, a coin cabinet, and a cabinet of natural curiosities (not accessible). Institutes in St Peter's Institute for Benedictine Studies In order to give young German-speaking Benedictine monks and nuns the opportunity to advance their education on monastic subjects, the Salzburg Abbots' Conference of 2000 set up the Institute for Benedictine Studies to serve the study of and research into the Rule of St Benedict (Regula Benedicti). The director is Dr. Michaela Puzicha OSB. Austrian Liturgical Institute Through the endeavours of Father Adalbero Raffelsberger, St Peter's was one of the earliest homes of liturgical revival in Austria. In 2001, the Liturgical Institute of the Austrian Bishops' Conference was attached to it. Cemetery St Peter's Cemetery The Petersfriedhof was probably laid out during the foundation of the monastery about 700. The burial ground was first mentioned under the rule of Archbishop Conrad I in 1139, with the oldest preserved graves from 1288 and 1300. It is centred around Lathe Gothic St Margaret's Chapel and the Chapel of the Cross, dedicated about 1170 and refurbished as a mausoleum according to plans by Santino Solari in 1614/15. Several tombs are located in arcades built at the foot of the Festungsberg hill. The cemetery grounds are known for its 'catacombs' carved out of the conglomerate rocks of the Festungsberg. They probably date back to Late Antiquity, when they served as an Early Christian place of assembly and hermitage. The include two chapels dedicated to Saint Gertrude and one Christian martyr Maximus by Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach in 1172 and 1178.

She was the longtime companion of Elsie de Wolfe (later known as Lady Mendl), a prominent socialite and famous interior decorator. Personal life Bessie Marbury and Elsie de Wolfe from My Crystal Ball, 1923 Bessie Marbury was born and raised in the affluent and cultured home of one of 19th- century New York's oldest and most prominent \\"society\\" families. She was reputedly a descendant of Calvinist Anne Hutchinson (n√©e Marbury), who co- founded Rhode Island after her banishment from Massachusetts Bay Colony. Bessie Marbury both used and defied these connections during the Victorian era to establish herself as an important literary and theatrical talent agent and theatrical producer, helping to define and create these very professions as they emerged in the new world of mass production, advertising and popular culture in post-Civil War American society. For many, Marbury remains a contradictory figure. Although she was the embodiment of female independence in almost every way, she initially opposed suffrage. She made a bold reversal once women in the United States did receive the right to vote, and in 1918 she became active in the Democratic Party, serving as a delegate. She was also a passionate convert to Roman Catholicism. She was likewise very active in the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic organization. In 1923 she published an autobiography, My Crystal Ball:Reminiscences (NY: Boni and Liveright, [1923]). She had earlier published Manners: A Handbook of Social Customs in 1888. Irving House, New York City, NY Marbury never married, but lived openly for more than 20 years with Elsie de Wolfe in what many observers accepted as a lesbian relationship, p. 494 (\\"famous lesbian relationship... openly received...\\") p. 204 (\\"Miss Marbury... was the lesbian lover of Elsie De Wolfe...\\") first at Irving House and then at 13 Sutton Place. William Bruce Ellis Ranken (1881-1941)/LOC cph.3c13318. Photograph of painting by William Rankin of Elisabeth Marbury in her summer home Marbury had a long lasting friendship with Elizabeth Arden (1878-1966), a Canadian-born American businesswoman who founded what is now Elizabeth Arden, Inc. They spent many weekends at Marbury's Maine home, Lakeside Farm. After Marbury's death in 1933, Arden bought the property with the intention of fulfilling Marbury's wish that it be turned into a home for working women‚Äîthough it eventually became part of a luxury resort instead. Marbury died in 1933. Her funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral was attended by an impressive array of the most important American leaders and dignitaries of the day. De Wolfe was noticeably absent from the funeral, despite the fact that she was the prime beneficiary of Marbury's will. Bessie Marbury is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. Professional life Marbury's clients ranged from the French Academy of Letters to playwrights Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw; to the dance team of Vernon and Irene Castle. She was an early promoter of African American writers of the Harlem Renaissance. She also played an instrumental role in developing the modern \\"Book Musical\\" that audiences came to know as defining \\"Broadway\\" in the 20th century, notably of Cole Porter's first musical, See America First,See America First entry at IBDb and Jerome Kern (Nobody Home (1915), Very Good, Eddie (1915), and Love O' Mike (1917))through her American Play company. Marbury and de Wolfe discovered their careers amid the amateur theatrical performances in high society in late Victorian New York. Both would end up defying this world's rules and expectations for women by making their interest in theater professional, and in no small way helped pave the way for many other \\"respectable ladies\\" that followed, both in the previously frowned upon world of the professional theater as well as independent careers and financial autonomy for women in general. Thus it was at an 1885 successful benefit theatrical performance that she had organized that Marbury was inspired to try her hand at theater management. In 1888 she persuaded Frances Hodgson Burnett, who had written a dramatic version of her best-selling Little Lord Fauntleroy, to hire her as business manager and agent. The association quickly proved highly profitable to both women. In 1891, Marbury traveled to France, and for 15 years she was the representative in the English-speaking market for playwright Victorien Sardou and the other members of the Soci√©t√© des Gens de Lettres, including Georges Feydeau, Edmond Rostand, Ludovic Hal√©vy, and Jean Richepin. Her work on their behalf included securing suitable translations, sound productions with leading actors, and full royalties. She also represented George Bernard Shaw, James M. Barrie (whom she prevailed upon to rewrite The Little Minister for Maude Adams), Hall Caine, and Jerome K. Jerome, among British authors, and Rachel Crothers and Clyde Fitch among Americans. Her office thus became a center of the New York theatrical business, and for many years Marbury worked closely with Charles Frohman and his Theatrical Syndicate in bringing order to a rapidly expanding field of enterprise. She later worked with the rival Shubert Brothers' organization. In both cases this drew criticism from those who fought the de facto monopoly held by these \\"Theater Trusts,\\" particularly from the noted American actress Minnie Maddern Fiske, who unsuccessfully struggled in the 1890s to form an actors union to fight the numerous fees and censorship imposed on actors and theater professionals by the Theater Trust. In 1914, Marbury joined several other agents in forming the American Play Company, and she then turned to producing and helped stage Nobody Home (1915), Very Good, Eddie (1915), and Love O' Mike (1917), all with music by Jerome Kern, and See America First (1916) with music by Cole Porter. These works contributed significantly to the development of the characteristically American form of musical comedy. Marbury's other successes include bringing Vernon and Irene Castle, whom she had seen on one of her innumerable trips to Paris, to New York in 1913 and setting them up in a fashionable dancing school that was the springboard for their brief but spectacularly popular career. Interior of Elsie De Wolfe' music pavilion looking out on to the pool, The Villa Trianon, William Bruce Ellis Ranken Marbury put her life story into a book My Crystal Ball, published in 1923. She had been told frequently that Hollywood would be interested ‚Äì this during the Silent Film Era ‚Äì in the story of her travels with her companions Anne Tracy Morgan (daughter of Jon Pierpont Morgan, the financier) and America's first interior designer, Elsie de Wolfe. Elizabeth convinced Miss Morgan to purchase the Villa Trianon in the town of Versailles, where the trio held court with Europe's elite and entertained with George Bernard Shaw and Oscar Wilde, two clients she represented theatrically in New York and London. After the German invasion of 1914, Anne, Elsie and Bess Marbury escaped in their Rolls Royce convertible after packing hastily. In 1920, Marbury and De Wolfe hired architect Mott B. Schmidt to remodel and update their recently purchased Italianate style brownstone that had been built by Effingham Sutton in the 1870s on what was then known as Avenue A. Schmidt created a simple, elegant home with a French flair. In 1921 Marbury and de Wolfe's friends, Anne Morgan and Anne Vanderbilt also purchased brownstones on the same block, recently renamed Sutton Place, and once again Mott Schmidt was hired to transform the old Italianate houses into an elegant colonial and federal style home, respectively. Sutton Place quickly became a fashionable enclave. It was from their new residence at Sutton Place that Marbury began to work with the greatest musical talents of the time to dominate Broadway. Before her death, Marbury chose her nephew John Marbury to produce a picture based on My Crystal Ball. The rights passed through John's estate to his son, the late New York sculptor Peter Marbury. The rights are held currently by Peter Marbury's widow, Diana Marbury, a New York theatrical producer, director and actress. Social life On the domestic front, Marbury was instrumental in assisting her companion Elsie de Wolfe in creating a career in interior decoration and in 1903 restoring Villa Trianon in Versailles, France, where she, de Wolfe, and Anne Tracy Morgan (youngest child of the powerful financier, J.P. Morgan) held court and became noted hostesses, affectionately referred to as \\"The Versailles Triumvirate\\". In 1903, along with Morgan and Anne Harriman Vanderbilt, Marbury helped organize the Colony Club, the first women's social club in New York. This also served as de Wolfe's professional debut as interior decorator. This same coterie would go on to create the exclusive neighborhood of Sutton Place, along Manhattan's East River, which prompted gossip papers of the 1920s to loudly whisper of an \\"Amazon Enclave\\". During World War I, Marbury devoted much time to relief work for French and later American soldiers, and spent several months in France working in military hospitals and giving talks to the troops. She translated Maurice Barr√®s's The Faith of France (1918) and was decorated by the French and Belgian governments, although she was notably disappointed to not be awarded by the French Legion of Honor, an honor given to de Wolfe for her work in the pioneering Ambrine Mission for Burn Victims. De Wolfe announced her wedding to Sir Charles Mendl, a British diplomat in 1926, after at least thirty years of living with Marbury. According to biographies of de Wolfe, the Mendl-de Wolfe marriage was platonic, with the couple keeping separate apartments in Paris and usually only appearing together at social functions. Both de Wolfe and Mendel assured an understandably enraged Marbury that the marriage was purely one of convenience. Weeks after the marriage, de Wolfe traveled to New York to reconcile with Marbury. Their relationship lasted another seven years until Marbury's death in 1933. p. 124 (\\"Mendl...assured the enraged Marbury that he had no intentions of replacing her in de Wolfe's affections, and that marriage was purely one of convenience, and that perhaps as a business woman she could understand the social and commercial value of such a contract. A few weeks later, de Wolfe traveled to New York for a personal reconciliation with her long time companion, and the two continued their post-war pattern...until Marbury's death in 1933. \\") Catalog Books  Productions under aegis of Elisabeth Marbury * Electra, revival, produced with Elisabeth Marbury, December 26, 1930 to January 1931 * Say When, original musical-comedy, produced by Elisabeth Marbury, June 26, 1928 to July 1928 * Revue Russe, original musical revue, produced by Elisabeth Marbury, October 5, 1922 to October 22, 1922 * Girl o' Mine, original musical- comedy, produced by Elisabeth Marbury, January 28, 1918 to March 9, 1918 * Love O' Mike, original musical-comedy, produced by Elisabeth Marbury, January 15, 1917 to September 29, 1917 * See America First, original musical, produced by Elisabeth Marbury, March 28, 1916 to April 8, 1916 * Very Good Eddie, original musical, produced by Marbury-Comstock Co., December 23, 1915 to October 14, 1916 * Our Children, original play, produced with Elisabeth Marbury, September 10, 1915 to September 1915 * Nobody Home, original play with music, produced by Elisabeth Marbury, April 20, 1915 to August 7, 1915 * Merry Gotham, original play, written by Elisabeth Marbury, March 14, 1892 to April 1892 References Notes Further reading *Marbury, Elisabeth.

Engraving in Le Monde illustr√©, 16 December 1865. Salvador Agust√≠n Francisco de Paula de Iturbide y Marz√°n (18 September 1849 in Mexico City ‚Äì 26 February 1895 in Ajaccio, Corsica) was the grandson of Agust√≠n de Iturbide, the first emperor of independent Mexico, and his consort Empress Ana Mar√≠a. He became the adopted son, along with his cousin Agust√≠n de Iturbide y Green, of Mexico's only other royal heads of state‚ÄîEmperor Maximilian I and Empress Carlota of Mexico.  Biography   Family  Salvador de Iturbide y Marz√°n, born into the Mexican nobility, was the son of Emperor Agustin I's third son Prince Salvador of Mexico and Rosario de Marz√°n y Guisasola. When Maximilian and Carlota ascended the throne of Mexico in 1863 with the support of the French troops of Napoleon III, the new monarchs invited the Iturbide family back to Mexico. As it became clear that Maximilian and Carlota could have no children together, they offered to adopt Salvador along with his cousin, Agust√≠n de Iturbide y Green. They formally adopted the cousins and granted them the title Prince de Iturbide and style of Highness by imperial decree on 16 September 1865. Salvador and his cousin were ranked after the reigning family. His adoptive mother, Empress Carlota, sent him to France, where he lived at Paris until 1867, when he moved to Hungary. After seeking the right to a pension as an heir to the Mexican throne, he was awarded one by the Emperor Franz Joseph, Emperor Maximilian's brother; Don Salvador regularly petitioned to have it increased.Casa Imperial, Don Salvador  Marriage  In Vienna, It√∫rbide became the friend of a young Hungarian aristocrat, Baron Gyula G√°sp√°r Mikos de Tar√≥dhaza who had just returned from a long trip through South America. It√∫rbide was invited to the Mikos family estate in Mikosdpuszta, where he was introduced to Baroness Gizella Mikos. On 21 June 1871, Don Salvador and Baroness Gizela were married at the Mikosdpuszta mansion. They had a daughter, Maria Josepha Sophia de Iturbide. Following the marriage the pair lived in Mikosdpuszta, but the owner of the estate, Baron J√°nos Mikos, sold the castle in 1881. It√∫rbide and his wife moved to Venice and lived in a palace, rented to Count Zeno. In this place, he became a close friend of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, the Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne.  Death  He was a member of the Order of the Grand Cross of Our Lady of Guadalupe and awarded with the Personal Order of Charles (the Duke of Madrid). While visiting Corsica, he became sick and died of a ruptured appendix.  Decree  The Emperor Maximilian of Habsburg decreed on September 16, 1865 Digital UANL Imperial Almanac the following: * Art 1 ¬∞. The title of \\"Princes of Iturbide\\" is awarded to Don Agust√≠n de Iturbide and Don Salvador de Iturbide, grandsons of the Emperor Agust√≠n de Iturbide, as well as his daughter Do√±a Josefa de Iturbide. * Art 2 ¬∞.

Born in Lincoln, England, in 1834, nothing is known of his ancestry or early life. In December 1850 he arrived in Western Australia on board the Mary, obtaining employment in the firm of George Shenton Sr. Between 1855 and 1857 he worked for Robert Habgood, before returning to Shenton's employment as manager of his Geraldton business. When Shenton died in 1867, Crowther purchased his business at Geraldton. Later, he purchased and ran the Greenough Hotel. Crowther became increasingly involved in Geraldton's public and political life from 1871, when he was first elected to the Geraldton Municipal Council. In 1872, he ran the Western Australian Legislative Council seat of Greenough election campaign for his friend George Shenton Jr, who was absent from the colony at the time. On the evening after the election Crowther held a supper and ball for Shenton's supporters. Although \\"treating the electors\\" was a common practice at the time, Shenton's opponent Henry Gray lodged a complaint alleging that Crowther had bribed the electorate. In July 1873, the Supreme Court upheld Gray's complaint, finding that Crowther's actions might have induced electors to vote for Shenton. No blame was attached to Shenton, but the election was declared void and a new by-election ordered for 29 June 1873. Shenton then declined to stand for election again, so Crowther resigned his seat on the local council and contested the Legislative Council seat himself, heavily defeating Gray. In 1875, Crowther joined Samuel Mitchell in an unsuccessful lead mine venture. That year he also returned to the Geraldton Municipal Council as its chairman. He resigned from the council in 1876, but served on it again in 1878 and 1879. In 1881 he became the first Mayor of Geraldton. He also acted as resident magistrate and chairman of Quarter Sessions for the district. He resigned as member for Greenough on 29 April 1887. When the Legislative Council became nominative on the advent of responsible government in December 1890, Crowther declined a nomination. He again declined a nomination in August 1893. He died, unmarried, at Geraldton on 17 March 1894.

He played college football at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School from 1912 to 1913 and Georgia Institute of Technology from 1917 to 1918 and with a number of professional clubs from 1919 to 1927. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1966 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1971. Early life Guyon was born on the White Earth Indian Reservation in White Earth, Minnesota. He received only a sixth-grade education from the American government. Guyon also spent time in Magdalena, New Mexico. Football career College Carlisle Guyon attended and played college football at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School from 1912 to 1913 under head coach Pop Warner. Sportswriters often tried to call him \\"Injun Joe\\" after the character in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but it never much caught on outside the press. 1912 Carlisle Indians The 1912 team posted a 12‚Äì1‚Äì1 record, scored 454 points, and was Jim Thorpe's greatest season. Guyon played on the team as left tackle. In the game against Army featuring the likes of future US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Leland Devore was ejected for manhandling Guyon. The 1913 team went 10‚Äì1‚Äì1, scoring 296 points. Guyon shifted to Thorpe's place at halfback and was honored by Walter Camp as a second-team All-American. Keewatin From 1914 to 1915, Guyon attended the Keewatin Academy in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, to regain college eligibility. Georgia Tech Guyon then attended and played football at Georgia Tech from 1917 to 1918 under head coach John Heisman. Guyon was used mainly as a halfback. His brother Charles \\"Wahoo\\" Guyon was the assistant coach. For his time spent playing at Georgia Tech, Guyon was a unanimous selection for an Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1869-1919 era. Fullback Judy Harlan said about Guyon, \\"Once in a while the Indian would come out in Joe, such as the nights Heisman gave us a white football and had us working out under the lights. That's when Guyon would give out the blood curdling war whoops.\\" =1917= Tech's 1917 backfield; left to right: Strupper, Harlan, Guyon, and Hill The 1917 team went 9‚Äì0, scored 491 points, was crowned national champion, and was for many years considered \\"the greatest the South ever produced.\\" Guyon played right halfback, where he was the team's power back and best passer. He was a unanimous All-Southern selection, and considered by some the South's best back. His first run from scrimmage for Tech was a 75-yard touchdown against Wake Forest. In a 63‚Äì0 rout of Washington & Lee, Guyon knocked a Washington & Lee player out of the game by \\"wearing an old horse collar shaped into a shoulder pad but reinforced with a little steel\\" according to Judy Harlan. Against Vanderbilt University he had arguably his greatest game, running 12 times for 344 yards in an 83‚Äì0 blowout. According to sportswriter Morgan Blake, \\"Guyon has been great in all games this year. But Saturday he was the superman\\". Against Tulane, each of the four members of the backfield eclipsed 100 yards rushing. \\"Strupper, Guyon, Hill, and Harlan form a backfield with no superiors and few equals in football history\\" wrote the Times-Picayune. He passed for two touchdowns and ran for one, passing 91 yards and running 112: \\"Guyon's passing was so accurate it suggest possibilities yet undeveloped in the Tech offense\\". In the large, 68‚Äì7 win over Auburn, Guyon once dove at its star Moon Ducote and missed, but Guyon gave chase from behind and tackled him at the 26-yard line. =1918= The 1918 team went 6‚Äì1, scoring 462. Guyon was used mainly as a fullback, though sometimes as a tackle. He was honored as a tackle on Frank G. Menke's first All-America team. Professional Guyon Guyon signed to play professional football with the Canton Bulldogs in 1919. After the NFL was organized in 1920, he played seven more seasons with the Washington Senators, Cleveland Indians, Oorang Indians, Rock Island Independents, Kansas City Cowboys, and the New York Giants. From 1919 to 1924, he teamed with another outstanding Indian halfback, Jim Thorpe. They parted ways late in the 1924 season when Guyon left the Independents to go to Kansas City. He stayed with the Cowboys in 1925 while Thorpe went to the Giants. Then in 1927, Guyon joined the Giants and helped lead the team to the 1927 NFL Championship. Coaching Guyon coached the Bulldogs of Union University in Jackson, Tennessee in 1919. He returned to Union in 1923 and coached all sports from 1923 to 1927. Union inducted Guyon into its sports hall of fame in 2008.https://www.uu.edu/events/homecoming/2008/AlumniEvents_2008.pdf Guyon coached the backfield of the 1920 Georgia Tech team. He also coached high school football at St. Xavier High School in Louisville, Kentucky from 1931 to 1933, with a 16‚Äì7‚Äì2 record. Baseball career Guyon was also a \\"minor league baseball star\\".http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/history/full- text/NH2004NebrIndians.pdf Player Guyon had previously hit over .340 three consecutive years for the Louisville Colonels in the American Association, which at AA, was at the highest classification of the era. His playing career as an outfielder extended from 1920 through 1936 with a break during his college coaching career. Coach Guyon was the head coach of the Clemson Tigers baseball team at Clemson University from 1928 to 1931. He managed the Anderson Electrics in the Palmetto League in 1931, the Asheville Tourists in 1932, and the Fieldale Towlers in 1936.

He was one of the fiercest opponents of King Henry IV of Germany during the Investiture Controversy. Life Hohensalzburg Fortress Of Gebhard's origins, all that is known for certain is that he was born in the German stem duchy of Swabia. Although he appeared in a 17th-century genealogy by Gabriel Bucelin as a scion of the comital House of Helfenstein, this lineage is entirely speculative. Gebhard assumedly studied in Paris, was ordained a priest at Salzburg in 1055 and became court chaplain to Emperor Henry III. Then a loyal supporter of the Salian dynasty, he also travelled as an ambassador to the Byzantine court at Constantinople and held the office of an Imperial chancellor between 1057 and 1059. On 30 July 1060 he was consecrated bishop of the Archdiocese of Salzburg. He reorganized the tithes paid by the Carantanian peasants and the parish system in Carinthia, where he in 1072 dissolved the double monastery of Gurk Abbey, founded by Saint Hemma in 1043, and replaced it by the suffragan Diocese of Gurk. Gebhard also established Admont Abbey in 1074, vested with Hemma's estates in the Carinthian March of Styria. Besides this, he had the fortresses Hohensalzburg, Hohenwerfen and Friesach built. Yet in 1075, Gebhard had backed the German king Henry IV struggling with the Great Saxon Revolt. In the following Investiture Controversy however, he was on the side of Pope Gregory VII. Like his friend Bishop Altmann of Passau he did not attend the 1076 Synod of Worms held by the king and instead allied with the oppositional princes at the diet of Trebur later in that year. Even after Henry's Walk to Canossa, Gebhard supported the election of antiking Rudolf of Rheinfelden in March 1077. As he was unwilling to be reconciled with the king, Henry IV expelled him from Salzburg. While his diocese was devastated by the king's forces, Gebhard spent nine years in Swabia and Saxony, trying to win the support of the bishops for the cause of Pope Gregory VII. Meanwhile in Salzburg, Berthold von Moosburg was installed as anti-bishop in 1085. Gebhard was not able to return to Salzburg until 1086, assisted by the support of Duke Welf I of Bavaria. Gebhard died at Hohenwerfen on 15 June 1088 and is buried in the church of Admont Abbey. His feast day is 15 June. He is shown as a bishop with a Greek cross and a unicorn. In 1629 a process of canonization was begun but delayed due to the Thirty Years' War and has never been concluded.

This includes nitrogen compounds, water, CO2, phosphates, sulphates, etc. Animals treat these compounds as excretes. Plants have chemical \\"machinery\\" which transforms some of them (primarily the nitrogen compounds) into useful substances. All the metabolic wastes are excreted in a form of water solutes through the excretory organs (nephridia, Malpighian tubules, kidneys), with the exception of CO2, which is excreted together with the water vapor throughout the lungs. The elimination of these compounds enables the chemical homeostasis of the organism. Nitrogen wastes The nitrogen compounds through which excess nitrogen is eliminated from organisms are called nitrogenous wastes () or nitrogen wastes. They are ammonia, urea, uric acid, and creatinine. All of these substances are produced from protein metabolism. In many animals, the urine is the main route of excretion for such wastes; in some, the feces is. Ammonotelism Ammonotelism is the excretion of ammonia and ammonium ions. Ammonia (NH3) forms with the oxidation of amino groups.(-NH2), which are removed from the proteins when they convert into carbohydrates. It is a very toxic substance to tissues and extremely soluble in water. Only one nitrogen atom is removed with it. A lot of water is needed for the excretion of ammonia, about 0.5 L of water is needed per 1 g of nitrogen to maintain ammonia levels in the excretory fluid below the level in body fluids to prevent toxicity. Thus, the marine organisms excrete ammonia directly into the water and are called ammonotelic. Ammonotelic animals include protozoans, crustaceans, platyhelminths, cnidarians, poriferans, echinoderms, and other aquatic invertebrates. Ureotelism The excretion of urea is called ureotelism. Land animals, mainly amphibians and mammals, convert ammonia into urea, a process which occurs in the liver and kidney. These animals are called ureotelic. Urea is a less toxic compound than ammonia; two nitrogen atoms are eliminated through it and less water is needed for its excretion. It requires 0.05 L of water to excrete 1 g of nitrogen, approximately only 10% of that required in ammonotelic organisms. Uricotelism Uricotelism is the excretion of excess nitrogen in the form of uric acid. Uricotelic animals include insects, birds and most reptiles. Though requiring more metabolic energy to make than urea, uric acid's low toxicity and low solubility in water allow it to be concentrated into small volume of pasty white suspension, compared to the liquid urine of mammals. Water and gases These compounds form during the catabolism of carbohydrates and lipids in condensation reactions, and in some other metabolic reactions of the amino acids. Oxygen is produced by plants and some bacteria in photosynthesis, while CO2 is a waste product of all animals and plants. Nitrogen gases are produced by denitrifying bacteria and as a waste product, and bacteria for decaying yield ammonia, as do most invertebrates and vertebrates. Water is the only liquid waste from animals and photosynthesizing plants.\\"excretion.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.

Solids Nitrates and nitrites are wastes produced by nitrifying bacteria, just as sulfur and sulfates are produced by the sulfur- reducing bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Insoluble iron waste can be made by iron bacteria by using soluble forms. In plants, resins, fats, waxes, and complex organic chemicals are exuded from plants, e.g., the latex from rubber trees and milkweeds. Solid waste products may be manufactured as organic pigments derived from breakdown of pigments like hemoglobin, and inorganic salts like carbonates, bicarbonates, and phosphate, whether in ionic or in molecular form, are excreted as solids.

Personal life and career Jouett was the son of Sallie Robards and Jack Jouett, a hero of the American Revolution. The elder Jouett sent his son to Transylvania University and encouraged him to study law, but Matthew spent much of his time painting. The frustrated father commented \\"I sent Matthew to college to make a gentleman of him, and he has turned out to be nothing but a damned sign painter.\\" Thomas Jefferson Jouett served as a volunteer officer of the 28th Kentucky Infantry in the War of 1812 and was among the survivors of the River Raisin Massacre. The company payroll of $6000 disappeared during the slaughter. Jouett restored the missing funds to the militia, based on his earnings as a painter. He also painted portraits of his fellow soldiers from memory, including Hart and Colonel Allen. Portrait of Catherine Cornelia PratherMatthew Harris Jouett married Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Henderson Allen of Lexington, Kentucky on May 25, 1812. They had nine children. One of their sons was James Edward Jouett, a naval officer. James served with Admiral David Farragut and was immortalized in Farragut's famous quote \\"Damn the torpedoes! Four bells! Captain Drayton go ahead! Jouett full speed!\\" Jouett was promoted to captain during the War of 1812. Afterwards, he studied portraiture and went to Boston to study with Gilbert Stuart in 1816. He painted in New Orleans from 1817 to 1827 during the winter season and was listed in the 1824 New Orleans Directory as a portrait painter working at 49 Canal Street. He was commissioned by the Kentucky legislature to paint a portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette. Jouett also painted Thomas Jefferson and the child Catherine Cornelia Prather. It wasn't until the 1893 Chicago World Fair, that his fame as a painter began. His paintings were greatly appreciated by the curators and the general public. His work is more collectible today than it was during his lifetime, and as such catches higher prices. Jouett became one of the most highly esteemed portrait painters in the United States, honored with a major centenary exhibition at the Speed Museum in his home state. Matthew Jouett is buried in Cave Hill Cemetery.

The ice stream is the subject of different glaciological studies, one of which is looking at subglacial lakes that researchers believe may be speeding the movement of the ice as they periodically fill and drain. Other researchers, also funded by the National Science Foundation, reported in the June 5, 2008 issue of the journal Nature that, from seismological and GPS data, they discovered the Whillans Ice Stream releases two bursts of seismic waves every day, each one equivalent to a magnitude 7 earthquake. The data show that the river of ice moves about a half-meter within approximately 30 minutes, remains still for 12 hours, then moves another half-meter, seemingly in phase with gravitational tides. Each time it moves, it emits seismic waves that are recorded at seismographs around Antarctica and even as far away as Australia, a distance of more than 6,400 kilometers. In 2007, an active subglacial water system consisting of several interconnected subglacial lakes was discovered under Whillans Ice Stream using repeat-track data from the ICESat satellite (Fricker and others, 2007). One of these active lakes, subglacial Lake Whillans, is the subject of a major drilling program funded by National Science Foundation (Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access (WISSARD)) which successfully reached the lake on January 28, 2013.

She wrote her first novel, Now In November, while living in her mother's attic in Webster Groves, Missouri. She remained on her farm in Webster Groves and completed Winter Orchard in 1935. She published four more books before marrying Grant G. Cannon, editor in chief of the Farm Quarterly, in 1942. The couple moved to Iowa City, where she taught at the University of Iowa for the next three years. They moved to Hamilton County, Ohio in 1947, where she published Wildwood. Johnson had three children: Terence, Ann, and Carol. The Cannons continued to move beyond the advancing urban sprawl of Cincinnati, finally settling on the wooded acreage in Clermont County, Ohio, which is the setting of The Inland Island.

Brunel built dockyards, the Great Western Railway (GWR), a series of steamships including the first propeller-driven transatlantic steamship, and numerous important bridges and tunnels. His designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering. Though Brunel's projects were not always successful, they often contained innovative solutions to long-standing engineering problems. During his career, Brunel achieved many engineering firsts, including assisting in the building of the first tunnel under a navigable river (the River Thames) and the development of the , the first propeller-driven, ocean-going, iron ship, which, when launched in 1843, was the largest ship ever built. On the GWR, Brunel set standards for a well-built railway, using careful surveys to minimise gradients and curves. This necessitated expensive construction techniques, new bridges, new viaducts, and the long Box Tunnel. One controversial feature was the wide gauge, a \\"broad gauge\\" of , instead of what was later to be known as \\"standard gauge\\" of . He astonished Britain by proposing to extend the GWR westward to North America by building steam-powered, iron-hulled ships. He designed and built three ships that revolutionised naval engineering: the (1838), the (1843), and the (1859). In 2002, Brunel was placed second in a BBC public poll to determine the \\"100 Greatest Britons\\". In 2006, the bicentenary of his birth, a major programme of events celebrated his life and work under the name Brunel 200.  Early life  Isambard Kingdom Brunel was born on 9 April 1806 in Britain Street, Portsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire, where his father was working on block-making machinery. He was named Isambard after his father, the French civil engineer Sir Marc Isambard Brunel, and Kingdom after his English mother, Sophia Kingdom. He had two elder sisters, Sophia, the eldest child, and Emma. The whole family moved to London in 1808 for his father's work. Brunel had a happy childhood, despite the family's constant money worries, with his father acting as his teacher during his early years. His father taught him drawing and observational techniques from the age of four, and Brunel had learned Euclidean geometry by eight. During this time, he also learned fluent French and the basic principles of engineering. He was encouraged to draw interesting buildings and identify any faults in their structure.Buchanan (2006), p. 18 When Brunel was eight, he was sent to Dr Morrell's boarding school in Hove, where he learned classics. His father, a Frenchman by birth, was determined that Brunel should have access to the high- quality education he had enjoyed in his youth in France; accordingly, at the age of 14, the younger Brunel was enrolled first at the University of Caen Normandy, then at Lyc√©e Henri-IV in Paris.Brunel, Isambard (1870), p. 5. When Brunel was 15, his father, who had accumulated debts of over ¬£5,000, was sent to a debtors' prison. After three months went by with no prospect of release, Marc Brunel let it be known that he was considering an offer from the Tsar of Russia. In August 1821, facing the prospect of losing a prominent engineer, the government relented and issued Marc ¬£5,000 to clear his debts in exchange for his promise to remain in Britain. When Brunel completed his studies at Henri-IV in 1822, his father had him presented as a candidate at the renowned engineering school √âcole Polytechnique, but as a foreigner he was deemed ineligible for entry. Brunel subsequently studied under the prominent master clockmaker and horologist Abraham-Louis Breguet, who praised Brunel's potential in letters to his father. In late 1822, having completed his apprenticeship, Brunel returned to England. Thames Tunnel The Thames Tunnel in 2005 Brunel worked for several years as an assistant engineer on the project to create a tunnel under London's River Thames between Rotherhithe and Wapping, with tunnellers driving a horizontal shaft from one side of the river to the other under the most difficult and dangerous conditions. The project was funded by the Thames Tunnel Company and Brunel's father, Marc, was the chief engineer. The American Naturalist said \\"It is stated also that the operations of the Teredo [Shipworm] suggested to Mr. Brunel his method of tunneling the Thames.\\"Stearnes, R.E.C. \\"Toredo, or Shipworm.\\" The American Naturalist, Vol. 20, No. 2 (Feb. 1886), p. 136. The composition of the riverbed at Rotherhithe was often little more than waterlogged sediment and loose gravel. An ingenious tunnelling shield designed by Marc Brunel helped protect workers from cave-ins, but two incidents of severe flooding halted work for long periods, killing several workers and badly injuring the younger Brunel. The latter incident, in 1828, killed the two most senior miners, and Brunel himself narrowly escaped death. He was seriously injured, and spent six months recuperating.Sources disagree about where Brunel convalesced; Buchanan (p. 30) says Brighton, while Dumpleton and Miller (p. 16) say Bristol and connect this to his subsequent work on the Clifton Suspension Bridge there. The event stopped work on the tunnel for several years. Though the Thames Tunnel was eventually completed during Marc Brunel's lifetime, his son had no further involvement with the tunnel proper, only using the abandoned works at Rotherhithe to further his abortive Gaz experiments. This was based on an idea of his father's, and was intended to develop into an engine that ran on power generated from alternately heating and cooling carbon dioxide made from ammonium carbonate and sulphuric acid. Despite interest from several parties (the Admiralty included) the experiments were judged by Brunel to be a failure on the grounds of fuel economy alone, and were discontinued after 1834. In 1865, the East London Railway Company purchased the Thames Tunnel for ¬£200,000, and four years later the first trains passed through it. Subsequently, the tunnel became part of the London Underground system, and remains in use today, originally as part of the East London Line now incorporated into the London Overground.Bagust, Harold, \\"The Greater Genius?\\", 2006, Ian Allan Publishing, , (pp. 97‚Äì100) Bridges The Clifton Suspension Bridge spans Avon Gorge, linking Clifton in Bristol to Leigh Woods in North Somerset Brunel is perhaps best remembered for designs for the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. The bridge was built to designs based on Brunel's, but with significant changes. Spanning over , and nominally above the River Avon, it had the longest span of any bridge in the world at the time of construction. Brunel submitted four designs to a committee headed by Thomas Telford, but Telford rejected all entries, proposing his own design instead. Vociferous opposition from the public forced the organising committee to hold a new competition, which was won by Brunel. Afterwards, Brunel wrote to his brother-in-law, the politician Benjamin Hawes: \\"Of all the wonderful feats I have performed, since I have been in this part of the world, I think yesterday I performed the most wonderful. I produced unanimity among 15 men who were all quarrelling about that most ticklish subject‚Äîtaste\\". The Maidenhead Railway Bridge, at the time the largest span for a brick arch bridge Work on the Clifton bridge started in 1831, but was suspended due to the Queen Square riots caused by the arrival of Sir Charles Wetherell in Clifton. The riots drove away investors, leaving no money for the project, and construction ceased. Brunel did not live to see the bridge finished, although his colleagues and admirers at the Institution of Civil Engineers felt it would be a fitting memorial, and started to raise new funds and to amend the design. Work recommenced in 1862 and was completed in 1864, five years after Brunel's death. In 2011, it was suggested, by historian and biographer Adrian Vaughan, that Brunel did not design the bridge, as eventually built, as the later changes to its design were substantial. His views reflected a sentiment stated fifty-two years earlier by Tom Rolt in his 1959 book Brunel. Re-engineering of suspension chains recovered from an earlier suspension bridge was one of many reasons given why Brunel's design could not be followed exactly. Hungerford Bridge, a suspension footbridge across the Thames near Charing Cross Station in London, was opened in May 1845. Its central span was , and its cost was ¬£106,000. It was replaced by a new railway bridge in 1859, and the suspension chains were used to complete the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The Clifton Suspension Bridge still stands, and over 4 million vehicles traverse it every year. Brunel designed many bridges for his railway projects, including the Royal Albert Bridge spanning the River Tamar at Saltash near Plymouth, Somerset Bridge (an unusual laminated timber-framed bridge near Bridgwater), the Windsor Railway Bridge, and the Maidenhead Railway Bridge over the Thames in Berkshire. This last was the flattest, widest brick arch bridge in the world and is still carrying main line trains to the west, even though today's trains are about ten times heavier than in Brunel's time. The Royal Albert Bridge spanning the river Tamar at Saltash Throughout his railway building career, but particularly on the South Devon and Cornwall Railways where economy was needed and there were many valleys to cross, Brunel made extensive use of wood for the construction of substantial viaducts; these have had to be replaced over the years as their primary material, Kyanised Baltic Pine, became uneconomical to obtain. Brunel designed the Royal Albert Bridge in 1855 for the Cornwall Railway, after Parliament rejected his original plan for a train ferry across the Hamoaze‚Äîthe estuary of the tidal Tamar, Tavy and Lynher. The bridge (of bowstring girder or tied arch construction) consists of two main spans of , above mean high spring tide, plus 17 much shorter approach spans. Opened by Prince Albert on 2 May 1859, it was completed in the year of Brunel's death. Several of Brunel's bridges over the Great Western Railway might be demolished because the line is to be electrified, and there is inadequate clearance for overhead wires. Buckinghamshire County Council is negotiating to have further options pursued, in order that all nine of the remaining historic bridges on the line can be saved. Brunel's last major undertaking was the unique Three Bridges, London. Work began in 1856, and was completed in 1859. The three bridges in question are a clever arrangement allowing the routes of the Grand Junction Canal, Great Western and Brentford Railway, and Windmill Lane to cross each other. Great Western Railway Paddington station, still a mainline station, was the London terminus of the Great Western Railway A broad-gauge train on mixed-gauge track In the early part of Brunel's life, the use of railways began to take off as a major means of transport for goods. This influenced Brunel's involvement in railway engineering, including railway bridge engineering. In 1833, before the Thames Tunnel was complete, Brunel was appointed chief engineer of the Great Western Railway, one of the wonders of Victorian Britain, running from London to Bristol and later Exeter. The company was founded at a public meeting in Bristol in 1833, and was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1835. It was Brunel's vision that passengers would be able to purchase one ticket at London Paddington and travel from London to New York, changing from the Great Western Railway to the Great Western steamship at the terminus in Neyland, West Wales. He surveyed the entire length of the route between London and Bristol himself, with the help of many including his Solicitor Jeremiah Osborne of Bristol Law Firm Osborne Clarke who on one occasion rowed Brunel down the River Avon himself to survey the bank of the river for the route. Brunel made two controversial decisions: to use a broad gauge of for the track, which he believed would offer superior running at high speeds; and to take a route that passed north of the Marlborough Downs‚Äîan area with no significant towns, though it offered potential connections to Oxford and Gloucester‚Äîand then to follow the Thames Valley into London. His decision to use broad gauge for the line was controversial in that almost all British railways to date had used standard gauge. Brunel said that this was nothing more than a carry-over from the mine railways that George Stephenson had worked on prior to making the world's first passenger railway. Brunel proved through both calculation and a series of trials that his broader gauge was the optimum size for providing both higher speedsPudney, John (1974). Brunel and His World. Thames and Hudson. . and a stable and comfortable ride to passengers. In addition the wider gauge allowed for larger goods wagons and thus greater freight capacity. Weston Junction Station, by Brunel Drawing on Brunel's experience with the Thames Tunnel, the Great Western contained a series of impressive achievements‚Äîsoaring viaducts such as the one in Ivybridge, specially designed stations, and vast tunnels including the Box Tunnel, which was the longest railway tunnel in the world at that time. There is an anecdote that the Box Tunnel may have been deliberately aligned so that the rising sun shines all the way through it on Brunel's birthday. The initial group of locomotives ordered by Brunel to his own specifications proved unsatisfactory, apart from the North Star locomotive, and 20-year-old Daniel Gooch (later Sir Daniel) was appointed as Superintendent of Locomotive Engines. Brunel and Gooch chose to locate their locomotive works at the village of Swindon, at the point where the gradual ascent from London turned into the steeper descent to the Avon valley at Bath. Brunel's achievements ignited the imagination of the technically minded Britons of the age, and he soon became quite notable in the country on the back of this interest. After Brunel's death the decision was taken that standard gauge should be used for all railways in the country. At the original Welsh terminus of the Great Western railway at Neyland, sections of the broad gauge rails are used as handrails at the quayside, and a number of information boards there depict various aspects of Brunel's life. There is also a larger than life bronze statue of him holding a steamship in one hand and a locomotive in the other. The statue has been replaced after an earlier theft. The present London Paddington station was designed by Brunel and opened in 1854. Examples of his designs for smaller stations on the Great Western and associated lines which survive in good condition include Mortimer, Charlbury and Bridgend (all Italianate) and Culham (Tudorbethan). Surviving examples of wooden train sheds in his style are at Frome and Kingswear. The great achievement that was the Great Western Railway has been immortalised at Swindon Steam Railway Museum and the Didcot Railway Centre. The Didcot Railway Centre is notable for having a reconstructed segment of track, as well as a very rare working steam locomotive in the same gauge. Parts of society viewed the railways more negatively. Some landowners felt the railways were a threat to amenities or property values and others requested tunnels on their land so the railway could not be seen. Brunel's \\"atmospheric caper\\" A reconstruction of Brunel's atmospheric railway, using a segment of the original piping at Didcot Railway Centre A section of the actual pipe in the Swindon Steam Railway Museum Though unsuccessful, another of Brunel's interesting use of technical innovations was the atmospheric railway, the extension of the Great Western Railway (GWR) southward from Exeter towards Plymouth, technically the South Devon Railway (SDR), though supported by the GWR. Instead of using locomotives, the trains were moved by Clegg and Samuda's patented system of atmospheric (vacuum) traction, whereby stationary pumps sucked air from a pipe placed in the centre of the track. The section from Exeter to Newton (now Newton Abbot) was completed on this principle, and trains ran at approximately .Dumpleton and Miller (2002), p. 22 Pumping stations with distinctive square chimneys were sited at two-mile intervals. Fifteen-inch (381 mm) pipes were used on the level portions, and pipes were intended for the steeper gradients. The technology required the use of leather flaps to seal the vacuum pipes. The natural oils were drawn out of the leather by the vacuum, making the leather vulnerable to water, rotting it and breaking the fibres when it froze during the winter of 1847. It had to be kept supple with tallow, which is attractive to rats. The flaps were eaten, and vacuum operation lasted less than a year, from 1847 (experimental service began in September; operations from February 1848) to 10 September 1848. Deterioration of the valve due to the reaction of tannin and iron oxide has been cited as the last straw that sank the project, as the continuous valve began to tear from its rivets over most of its length, and the estimated replacement cost of ¬£25,000 was considered prohibitive. The system never managed to prove itself. The accounts of the SDR for 1848 suggest that atmospheric traction cost 3s 1d (three shillings and one penny) per mile compared to 1s 4d/mile for conventional steam power (because of the many operating issues associated with the atmospheric, few of which were solved during its working life, the actual cost efficiency proved impossible to calculate). A number of South Devon Railway engine houses still stand, including that at Totnes (scheduled as a grade II listed monument in 2007) and at Starcross. A section of the pipe, without the leather covers, is preserved at the Didcot Railway Centre. In 2017, inventor Max Schlienger unveiled a working model of an updated atmospheric railroad at his vineyard in the Northern California town of Ukiah. Transatlantic shipping Maiden voyage of the in April 1838 alt=A crowd of people watch a large black and red ship with one funnel and six masts adorned with flags Brunel had proposed extending its transport network by boat from Bristol across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City before the Great Western Railway opened in 1835. The Great Western Steamship Company was formed by Thomas Guppy for that purpose. It was widely disputed whether it would be commercially viable for a ship powered purely by steam to make such long journeys. Technological developments in the early 1830s‚Äîincluding the invention of the surface condenser, which allowed boilers to run on salt water without stopping to be cleaned‚Äîmade longer journeys more possible, but it was generally thought that a ship would not be able to carry enough fuel for the trip and have room for a commercial cargo. Brunel applied the experimental evidence of Beaufoy and further developed the theory that the amount a ship could carry increased as the cube of its dimensions, whereas the amount of resistance a ship experienced from the water as it travelled only increased by a square of its dimensions. This would mean that moving a larger ship would take proportionately less fuel than a smaller ship. To test this theory, Brunel offered his services for free to the Great Western Steamship Company, which appointed him to its building committee and entrusted him with designing its first ship, the .Beckett (2006), pp. 171‚Äì73 shortly before launch in 1858 The Great Eastern in 1866 When it was built, the Great Western was the longest ship in the world at with a keel. The ship was constructed mainly from wood, but Brunel added bolts and iron diagonal reinforcements to maintain the keel's strength. In addition to its steam-powered paddle wheels, the ship carried four masts for sails. The Great Western embarked on her maiden voyage from Avonmouth, Bristol, to New York on 8 April 1838 with of coal, cargo and seven passengers on board. Brunel himself missed this initial crossing, having been injured during a fire aboard the ship as she was returning from fitting out in London. As the fire delayed the launch several days, the Great Western missed its opportunity to claim title as the first ship to cross the Atlantic under steam power alone. Even with a four-day head start, the competing arrived only one day earlier and its crew was forced to burn cabin furniture, spare yards and one mast for fuel. In contrast, the Great Western crossing of the Atlantic took 15 days and five hours, and the ship arrived at her destination with a third of its coal still remaining, demonstrating that Brunel's calculations were correct. The Great Western had proved the viability of commercial transatlantic steamship service, which led the Great Western Steamboat Company to use her in regular service between Bristol and New York from 1838 to 1846. She made 64 crossings, and was the first ship to hold the Blue Riband with a crossing time of 13 days westbound and 12 days 6 hours eastbound. The service was commercially successful enough for a sister ship to be required, which Brunel was asked to design. Brunel had become convinced of the superiority of propeller-driven ships over paddle wheels. After tests conducted aboard the propeller-driven steamship , he incorporated a large six-bladed propeller into his design for the , which was launched in 1843. Great Britain is considered the first modern ship, being built of metal rather than wood, powered by an engine rather than wind or oars, and driven by propeller rather than paddle wheel. She was the first iron-hulled, propeller-driven ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Her maiden voyage was made in August and September 1845, from Liverpool to New York. In 1846, she was run aground at Dundrum, County Down. She was salvaged and employed in the Australian service. She is currently fully preserved and open to the public in Bristol, UK. Brunel at the launch of the Great Eastern with John Scott Russell and Lord Derby In 1852 Brunel turned to a third ship, larger than her predecessors, intended for voyages to India and Australia. The (originally dubbed Leviathan) was cutting-edge technology for her time: almost long, fitted out with the most luxurious appointments, and capable of carrying over 4,000 passengers. Great Eastern was designed to cruise non-stop from London to Sydney and back (since engineers of the time mistakenly believed that Australia had no coal reserves), and she remained the largest ship built until the start of the 20th century. Like many of Brunel's ambitious projects, the ship soon ran over budget and behind schedule in the face of a series of technical problems. The ship has been portrayed as a white elephant, but it has been argued by David P. Billington that in this case Brunel's failure was principally one of economics‚Äîhis ships were simply years ahead of their time. His vision and engineering innovations made the building of large-scale, propeller-driven, all-metal steamships a practical reality, but the prevailing economic and industrial conditions meant that it would be several decades before transoceanic steamship travel emerged as a viable industry. Great Eastern was built at John Scott Russell's Napier Yard in London, and after two trial trips in 1859, set forth on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York on 17 June 1860. Though a failure at her original purpose of passenger travel, she eventually found a role as an oceanic telegraph cable-layer. Under Captain Sir James Anderson, the Great Eastern played a significant role in laying the first lasting transatlantic telegraph cable, which enabled telecommunication between Europe and North America. Renkioi Hospital Britain entered into the Crimean War during 1854 and an old Turkish barracks became the British Army Hospital in Scutari. Injured men contracted a variety of illnesses‚Äîincluding cholera, dysentery, typhoid and malaria‚Äîdue to poor conditions there, and Florence Nightingale sent a plea to The Times for the government to produce a solution. Brunel was working on the Great Eastern amongst other projects, but accepted the task in February 1855 of designing and building the War Office requirement of a temporary, pre- fabricated hospital that could be shipped to Crimea and erected there. In five months the team he had assembled designed, built, and shipped pre-fabricated wood and canvas buildings, providing them complete with advice on transportation and positioning of the facilities. Brunel had been working with Gloucester Docks-based William Eassie on the launching stage for the Great Eastern. Eassie had designed and built wooden prefabricated huts used in both the Australian gold rush, as well as by the British and French Armies in the Crimea. Using wood supplied by timber importers Price & Co., Eassie fabricated 18 of the 50-patient wards designed by Brunel, shipped directly via 16 ships from Gloucester Docks to the Dardanelles. The Renkioi Hospital was subsequently erected near Scutari Hospital, where Nightingale was based, in the malaria-free area of Renkioi.. Hospital Development Magazine. 10 November 2005. Retrieved 22 September 2009. His designs incorporated the necessities of hygiene: access to sanitation, ventilation, drainage, and even rudimentary temperature controls. They were feted as a great success, with some sources stating that of the approximately 1,300 patients treated in the hospital, there were only 50 deaths. In the Scutari hospital it replaced, deaths were said to be as many as 10 times this number. Nightingale referred to them as \\"those magnificent huts\\". The practice of building hospitals from pre- fabricated modules survives today, with hospitals such as the Bristol Royal Infirmary being created in this manner. Personal life On 10 June 1830 Brunel was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media- library/sites/library/documents/special-collections/brunel-collection.pdf Brunel married Mary Elizabeth Horsley (b. 1813) on 5 July 1836. She came from an accomplished musical and artistic family, being the eldest daughter of composer and organist William Horsley. They established a home at Duke Street, Westminster, in London. The Brunel family grave, Kensal Green Cemetery, London While performing a conjuring trick for the amusement of his children in 1843 Brunel accidentally inhaled a half-sovereign coin, which became lodged in his windpipe. A special pair of forceps failed to remove it, as did a machine devised by Brunel to shake it loose. At the suggestion of his father, Brunel was strapped to a board and turned upside-down, and the coin was jerked free. He recuperated at Teignmouth, and enjoyed the area so much that he purchased an estate at Watcombe in Torquay, Devon. Here he commissioned William Burn to design Brunel Manor and its gardens to be his country home. He never saw the house or gardens finished as he died before it was completed. Brunel, a heavy smoker, who had been diagnosed with Bright's disease (nephritis), suffered a stroke on 5 September 1859, just before the Great Eastern made her first voyage to New York. He died ten days later at the age of 53 and was buried, like his father, in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. He is commemorated at Westminster Abbey in a window on the south side of the nave. Brunel was survived by his wife, Mary, and three children: Isambard Brunel Junior (1837‚Äì1902), Henry Marc Brunel (1842‚Äì1903) and Florence Mary Brunel (1847‚Äì1876). Henry Marc later became a successful civil engineer. Legacy Temple in London A celebrated engineer in his era, Brunel remains revered today, as evidenced by numerous monuments to him. There are statues in London at Temple (pictured), Brunel University and Paddington station, and in Bristol, Plymouth, Swindon, Milford Haven and Saltash. A statue in Neyland in Pembrokeshire in Wales was stolen in August 2010. The topmast of the Great Eastern is used as a flagpole at the entrance to Anfield, Liverpool Football Club's ground. Contemporary locations bear Brunel's name, such as Brunel University in London, shopping centres in Swindon and also Bletchley, Milton Keynes, and a collection of streets in Exeter: Isambard Terrace, Kingdom Mews, and Brunel Close. A road, car park, and school in his home city of Portsmouth are also named in his honour, along with one of the city's largest public houses. There is an engineering lab building at the University of Plymouth named in his honour. A public poll conducted by the BBC in 2001 to select the 100 Greatest Britons, Brunel was placed second, behind Winston Churchill. Brunel's life and works have been depicted in numerous books, films and television programs. The 2003 book and BBC TV series Seven Wonders of the Industrial World included a dramatisation of the building of the Great Eastern. Many of Brunel's bridges are still in use. Brunel's first engineering project, the Thames Tunnel, is now part of the London Overground network. The Brunel Engine House at Rotherhithe, which once housed the steam engines that powered the tunnel pumps, now houses the Brunel Museum dedicated to the work and lives of Henry Marc and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Many of Brunel's original papers and designs are now held in the Brunel Institute alongside the in Bristol, and are freely available for researchers and visitors. Brunel is credited with turning the town of Swindon into one of the fastest growing towns in Europe during the 19th century. Brunel's choice to locate the Great Western Railway locomotive sheds there caused a need for housing for the workers, which in turn gave Brunel the impetus to build hospitals, churches and housing estates in what is known today as the 'Railway Village'. According to some sources, Brunel's addition of a Mechanics Institute for recreation and hospitals and clinics for his workers gave Aneurin Bevan the basis for the creation of the National Health Service. FGW HST 43003 power car GWR Castle Class steam locomotive no. 5069 was named Isambard Kingdom Brunel, after the engineer; and BR Western Region class 47 diesel locomotive no. D1662 (later 47484) was also named Isambard Kingdom Brunel. GWR's successor Great Western Railway has named both its old InterCity 125 power car 43003 and new InterCity Electric Train 800004 as Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The Royal Mint struck two ¬£2 coins in 2006 to \\"celebrate the 200th anniversary of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his achievements\\". The first depicts Brunel with a section of the Royal Albert Bridge and the second shows the roof of Paddington Station. In the same year the Post Office issued a set of six wide commemorative stamps (SG 2607-12) showing the Royal Albert Bridge, the Box Tunnel, Paddington Station, the Great Eastern, the Clifton Suspension Bridge, and the Maidenhead Bridge. The words \\"I.K. BRUNEL ENGINEER 1859\\" were fixed to either end of the Royal Albert Bridge to commemorate his death in 1859, the year the bridge opened. The words were later partly obscured by maintenance access ladders but were revealed again by Network Rail in 2006 to honour his centenary. Brunel was the subject of Great, a 1975 animated film directed by Bob Godfrey. It won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film at the 48th Academy Awards in March 1976. At the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, Brunel was portrayed by Kenneth Branagh in a segment showing the Industrial Revolution.

John Kirby Allen (1810 ‚Äì August 15, 1838), was a co- founder of the city of Houston and a former member of the Republic of Texas House of Representatives. He was born in Canaseraga Village, New York (the present day hamlet of Sullivan in the Town of Sullivan, New York). He never married. He died of congestive fever on August 15, 1838, and was buried at Founders Memorial Cemetery in Houston.  Early years  When he was seven years old, John took his first job, as a bellboy in a hotel in Orrville (present day DeWitt, New York). Three years later, he started working as a clerk in a retail shop. At sixteen, he formed a partnership with a friend operating a hat store at Chittenango, New York, where his brother, Augustus Chapman Allen, was professor of mathematics. In 1827, John cashed in his interest in the hat store and followed his brother to New York City, where they were investors in H. and H. Canfield Company until 1832. The brothers then moved to Texas.  In Texas  The Allen brothers arrived first in Galveston, Texas and then moved to the small town of Saint Augustine. In 1833, John Allen and his brother associated with a group of entrepreneurs in Nacogdoches and started operating a business as land speculators.  During the Texas Revolution  Instead of joining the army when the Texas Revolution started, John and his brother engaged in the business of keeping supply channels open. At their own expense they outfitted a ship, the Brutus, for the purpose of protecting the Texas coast and assisting troops and supplies from the United States to arrive safely in Texas. Nevertheless, some members of the Texas provisional government objected to the Allen brothers' activities, and there were rumors that they were engaged in privateering. In January 1836, they sold the Brutus to the Texas Navy, and it became only the second ship in the fledgling Texas navy. John and Augustus Chapman Allen continued to raise money and operate as receivers and dispensers of supplies and funds for the war effort without charge. In spite of the brothers' services, gossip and censure were aimed at the Allens because they were not in the armed services. In politics On August 30, 1836, John Kirby Allen's candidacy for Representative of Nacogdoches County to the first Congress of the Republic of Texas was announced in the Telegraph and Texas Register. He was elected in September, and officially began his term on October 3. There, he served on the president's staff with the rank of major. It was during this political service that John and his brother Augustus founded the city of Houston. He also continued to operate a shipping business during this time, along with his partner, James Pinckney Henderson. In Congress, John Allen successfully lobbied to have the newly founded city of Houston named as the capital of the Republic. This gave Houston the boost it needed to survive its first years of initial development. On April 13, 1838, Allen was elected to the board of directors to the Galveston City Company, which was a stock company chartered by the Republic of Texas to found the City of Galveston. Legacy John Kirby Allen's tombstone at Founders Memorial Cemetery Several Houston landmarks, including Allen Parkway, Allen Center as well as Allen's Landing Park, immortalize the name of the city's founders. He is buried at Founders Memorial Cemetery along with his mother and father as well as most of his siblings.Davis, Rod. \\"Houston's really good idea Bus tour celebrates communities that forged a city.\\" San Antonio Express-News.

Early life and stage career Born in Philadelphia, MacLean was of Scottish descent, a sixth generation American. He was educated at Northwestern University and Lewis Institute of Technology, in Chicago. Although he came from a Navy family and was slated for Annapolis, he chose a different career path.MacLean, Barbara Barondess. One Life is Not Enough. New York: Hippocrene Books, 1986. After working as a bond salesman, MacLean enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and later played juvenile leads in repertory theatre and performed as supporting characters in major stage productions such as Peter Pan starring Maude Adams. Film MacLean's first film was the 1914 production As Ye Sow with Alice Brady, followed by bit parts in Fuss and Feathers and in two Mary Pickford features, Captain Kidd, Jr. and Johanna Enlists. He went on to appear with Dorothy Gish in The Hun Within, and he co-starred with Doris May in the romantic comedy 23 1/2 Hours' Leave, which was a big hit. From 1922 to 1929 he starred in 14 other features for Paramount and First National, all maintaining the standard light romantic comedy formula that continued to prove successful for him. MacLean during his film career was often billed as \\"The Man With the Million Dollar Smile\\". In 1929 he was cast in his only \\"talkie\\", Divorce Made Easy; he then retired from acting. Producer and screenwriter In 1932, MacLean made his debut as a producer with Ladies of the Jury. He produced a total of eight films for Paramount, including Tillie and Gus starring W.C. Fields, Ladies Should Listen starring Cary Grant, and Two for Tonight. He retired from film production in 1937 but continued to work as a freelance writer for movies and television during the 1940s and 1950s. Personal life and death MacLean was married four times. He married actress Faith Cole while both were performing in stock theater. They divorced in 1930. MacLean married actress Lorraine Eddy on March 3, 1931. He met his fourth wife, Barbara Barondess, in a producer's office in April 1932, six years before they wed. At the time they were already aware of each others' work and recognized each other's voices. In her 1986 autobiography One Life is Not Enough, Barondess recalls, \\"There was something in this man's manner and speech that made an indelible impression on me.\\" She describes him as having a vaulted, almost regal presence: MacLean, at age 77, died in 1967 in his Beverly Hills home from the effects of a stroke. His gravesite is located at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

She is a frequent commentator on issues related to health, homelessness and affordable housing. She is currently a visiting practitioner at Ryerson University. Early life and education Born in Cobourg, Ontario but raised in Kingston, Ontario, she went to Toronto to work and study at the Toronto General Hospital, where she received a diploma in nursing, in 1972. In 1985, she received a Bachelor of Applied Arts in nursing, from Ryerson Polytechnic Institute. In 1992, she received her Master of Education in Sociology, from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE). She was married twice; with her last marriage, to former Metro Toronto Councillor Roger Hollander, ending in divorce in 1995. She has a daughter and three grandsons. Community work She came to public prominence as a \\"street nurse\\", a term coined in the early 1990s by a homeless man in the impoverished downtown Toronto area where she worked. She is noted for her work with the homeless and poor populations in Canada's largest city, Toronto. She is an activist for affordable housing, public health and social justice. In 1998, along with other social justice activists and academics, she co-founded the Toronto Disaster Relief Committee (TDRC). They brought public attention to homelessness declaring it to be a man-made disaster, which in their view, qualified as a social welfare disaster requiring the same kind of response that governments give to natural disasters. This human-disaster was the basis for the name of the group and many of its ideas. The TDRC and Crowe promoted the idea of a \\"One Percent Solution\\" to end homelessness. The one percent solution calls for each level of government to commit an additional one percent of their budget towards affordable, social housing. Electoral politics In January 2010, Crowe entered electoral politics, by offering to run for the Ontario New Democratic Party, as their candidate in the February 4, 2010 by-election in the provincial riding of Toronto Centre. At the ONDP's January 10, 2010 nomination meeting, her candidacy went uncontested. She faced Ontario Liberal Party's candidate, Glen Murray, and Pamela Taylor for the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. Crowe finished a strong second, doubling the NDP's vote totals by taking 33 percent of the popular vote. She ran a second time in the 2011 provincial general election but lost to incumbent Glen Murray. For many years she worked closely with former Toronto City Councillor and leader of the federal NDP Jack Layton. She wrote the foreword to his book Homelessness. How to End the National Crisis which he co- authored with Michael Shapcott.  Dying for a Home  Crowe's book, Dying for a Home: Homeless Activists Speak Out, is a first-hand account of Canadian homelessness and also discusses the practical steps needed to address the problem.  A Knapsack Full of Dreams: Memoirs of a Street Nurse  Crowe published her memoirs, A Knapsack Full of Dreams: Memoirs of a Street Nurse in 2019. In it, she reflects on her life as a street nurse and advocate for the homeless; the role characterized by some journalists of a \\"relentless accuser\\" advocating for policy change that addresses the causes of social injustice, rather than dealing simply with the symptoms.  Films  Crowe has been involved in multiple documentary films about homelessness: Home Safe Hamilton (2010), Development research with filmmaker Laura Sky, Skyworks Charitable Foundation.

Awards She received an International Nursing Ethics Award in 2003 in Amsterdam. She was also the recipient of the Economic Justice Fellowship Award, from the Atkinson Charitable Foundation, in 2004 which was twice renewed. She was named Person of the Year by the Toronto Sun (2000) and was named Toronto's Best Homelessness advocate by NOW Magazine (2005). In January 2018, Cathy was appointed as a Member of the Order of Canada.

Background and education Stern was born in London in 1844, the eldest son of Viscount David de Stern, the German-born senior partner of the merchant bank of Stern Brothers, and Sophia, daughter of Aaron Asher Goldsmid, brother of Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid. He was the elder brother of Sir Edward Stern and the first cousin of Lord Michelham. He was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and admitted to the Inner Temple in 1874. Career Pictured in Suffolk Celebrities, 1893 For some time Stern worked in his father's firm of Stern Brothers. He unsuccessfully contested the Middle Division of Surrey in 1880 and 1884, Tiverton in 1885 and Ipswich in 1886 but was finally elected as MP for Stowmarket in a by-election in 1891. On 19 July 1895 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Wandsworth, of Wandsworth in the County of London (he also held a Portuguese viscountcy by right of his father). His elevation to the peerage was a quid pro quo for donations he had made to Gladstone. The then Liberal Prime Minister Lord Rosebery was only willing to fulfill that promise (given his own commitment to Lords reform) after receiving a written request from Gladstone that he honour the deal.H.J. Hanahn, \\"The Sale of Honours in Late Victorian England\\" Victorian Studies Vol. 3, No. 3 (Mar., 1960), Indiana University Press: pp 284-285. He was a Justice of the Peace for Surrey and London and was awarded the rank of honorary colonel in the 4th volunteer battalion of the East Surrey Regiment. He served as vice-president of the London and Counties Radical Union. Personal life Lord Wandsworth died at his London home, 10 Great Stanhope Street, Mayfair, on 10 February 1912, when the barony became extinct. He left an estate of nearly ¬£1,555,985, most of which was bequeathed to charity, over a million being given to found the Lord Wandsworth Orphanage. In 1920 (after delays caused by World War I) the orphanage's trustees opened a preparatory school for boys and girls between 5 and 12 years old at Gosden House in Bramley, Surrey. Under the terms of Lord Wandsworth's will, preference was given to the children of agricultural labourers from his former constituency in the north-western or Stowmarket parliamentary division of Suffolk. Pupils would leave the school by the age of 13, the girls continuing their education in Guildford while the boys went on to the Lord Wandsworth Agricultural College in Long Sutton, Hampshire, which is now known as Lord Wandsworth College.

Encyclopedia of International Organized Crime. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2005. Media reports have credited them with wealth of up to ¬£200 million. Background Clerkenwell During the 1980s Terence \\"Terry\\" George Adams formed a syndicate with his brothers Thomas \\"Tommy\\" Sean Adams and Patrick \\"Patsy\\" Daniel John Adams as its financier and enforcer respectively. The brothers were born to Irish parents, part of a large family of 11 children who grew up in Barnsbury, Islington. The syndicate was based in Clerkenwell while Terry Adams, until his admission of money laundering in 2007, had lived in Barnsbury. The syndicate expanded over years to include other members of the Adams' family and close childhood friends. A number of the brothers' siblings are understood to have no involvement in crime. The gang is allegedly heavily involved in drug trafficking and extortion as well as the hijacking of gold bullion shipments and security fraud. They have been linked to 25 gangland murders of informants and rival criminals. In addition to developing alleged connections to Metropolitan Police officials, they were also stated to have had a British Conservative MP in their pocket at one point. The shooting of the then 68-year-old \\"Mad\\" Frankie Fraser, a former enforcer for The Richardson Gang, in July 1991 was said to have been ordered by the Adams family ‚Äî though Fraser said he had been targeted by rogue police. The family is believed to have connections with various criminal organisations, specifically with South American drug cartels. The BBC has asserted that their influence decreased from 2000 onwards. Police officers, speaking off-record to British newspapers, have said that the family has been credited with acts that they simply did not carry out and this could be true given the number of alleged key gang members killed or imprisoned. However the Metropolitan Police took the Adams' alleged crimes sufficiently seriously to consider the need to involve a CPS-lead team of detectives and the Security Service (MI5) in order to crack the Adams mafia-like organised crime cartel. Tommy Adams was imprisoned for his involvement in money laundering and a drugs plot that was described as not having been sanctioned by his brothers. During an 18-month bugging operation by MI5, Terry Adams was recorded speaking about his brother in very strident terms and suggesting that, in 1998 at least, relations between them were kept to a minimum. It has been stated that they have a criminal fortune of up to ¬£200 million. Before Tommy and Terry Adams were convicted in 1998 and 2007 respectively, the failure of the police to secure convictions against them had led to a belief that they had undermined the justice system to become untouchables. Police, Crown Prosecution Service staff and jurors were said to have been bribed and intimidated leading to not-guilty verdicts against members of the gang that were said to be wrong. The gang's alleged leader, Terry Adams, has been serving a prison sentence since February 2007, and two of his brothers are under surveillance by the Serious Organised Crime Agency and police in Spain, making other criminals reluctant to do business with them. It has been said that Terry Adams faces severe financial difficulties having been ordered, in May 2007, to repay ¬£4.7 million in legal aid and pay prosecution costs of ¬£800,000. Sean \\"Tommy\\" Adams gained high-profile public attention during a trial in 2004, when he was described as having attended a meeting in 2002 at the request of the former football international Kenny Dalglish. Dalglish was a major shareholder in Wilmslow-based sports agency Pro Active, a leading sports management firm headed up by local businessman Paul Stretford. Dalglish was reported to have hired Adams during a protracted deal to secure Pro Active's exclusive management rights to Manchester United, and England football, striker Wayne Rooney, in circumstances where another company claimed to represent Rooney. In February 2010 a 38-year-old man, claiming to be Terry Adams' nephew, was convicted in a case known as the jigsaw murder: the trial revealed that the man, Stephen Marshall, had disposed four bodies for the Adamses. He was sentenced to at least 36 years in prison. In 2014, Sean \\"Tommy\\" Adams and 13 other people believed to be affiliated with the Clerkenwell Crime Syndicate were arrested in a police operation codenamed \\"Octopod.\\" Designer watches, six shotguns and large sums of money were found in other addresses across the city, with a concentration in north London. The arrests were linked to conspiracy to assault, money laundering, fraud and revenue offences. At the time, in December 2014, of the death of a bankrupt businessman Scot Young, who had been involved in 2013 in a high-profile divorce case, media reports that flagged Young's involvement with Patrick Adams asserted that Tommy Adams and Michael Adams faced no charges after their arrest earlier in 2014. Personnel and members Terry Adams Terence George Adams (born 18 October 1954 in London) was described as having more recently \\"adopted an almost genteel persona, buying clothes in expensive fabrics and indulging his love of art and antiques\\" to appear legitimate. His downfall came with the assistance of MI5 and the Inland Revenue. MI5, in a unique inter-departmental collaboration the first of its kind after the Cold War ended, played a leading part in the electronic war against organised crime‚Äîand turned its sights on Adams's international criminal cartel. Police and MI5 set up a secret squad to dismantle the Adams organisation, directed from an anonymous Hertfordshire address inside a secret bunker sited somewhere on the busy Hoddesdon commuter belt into London. Some of the recordings made over a period of 18 months suggested that Adams had retired from front line involvement in crime in 1990. Police sources believe Adams knew he was being monitored and had \\"stage managed\\" many conversations for the benefit of his defence. He, for example, was allegedly caught on tape, in 1998, telling his adviser Solly Nahome that he did not want to be involved with a particular illegal deal, which would affect his legitimate business. The Inland Revenue was suspicious enough to ask Adams to explain how he had amassed his personal fortune including his ¬£2 million house and his collection of valuable antiques. Adams invented a range of unlikely occupations, including jeweller and public relations executive. Transcripts of the surveillance and investigations into several front companies Adams set up proved he was lying. He was arrested in April 2003 detectives found art and antiques valued at ¬£500,000, ¬£59,000 in cash and jewellery worth more than ¬£40,000 in his home. On 9 March 2007 at a hearing at the Old Bailey, Andrew Mitchell QC summed up the prosecution's case in saying, \\"It is suggested that Terry Adams was one of the country‚Äôs most feared and revered organised criminals. He comes with a pedigree, as one of a family whose name had a currency all of its own in the underworld. A hallmark of his career was the ability to keep his evidential distance from any of the violence and other crime from which he undoubtedly profited.\\" The former Scottish gangster Paul Ferris asserted that none of the brothers is primus inter pares (first among equals or in sole charge). On 18 May 2007 Adams was ordered to pay ¬£4.8 million in legal fees to three law firms who had initially represented him under the UK's free legal aid scheme. He was also required to pay ¬£800,000 in prosecution costs. He admitted a single specimen money-laundering offence on 7 February 2007, and was jailed for seven years; he was released on 24 June 2010, but was recalled to prison in August 2011 for breaching his licence. Also, on 21 May 2007, he was ordered to file reports of his income for the next ten years. Open case files remain untried on Operation Trinity records and rumour still exists that several further prosecutions may eventually come to trial. Adams was released from prison on 24 June 2010. In August 2011 he appeared before City of London Magistrates court charged with 8 breaches of his Financial Reporting Order imposed upon him in 2007. District Judge Quentin Purdy said he was \\"shrewd and calculating\\"...You wilfully and, in my judgment, arrogantly sought to frustrate the effect of a financial reporting order, well knowing that a significant confiscation order remains largely unpaid.\\" In July 2014 Adams appeared before a High Court judge in London where he claimed that he was penniless and living in a one bedroom apartment. Adams was ordered to pay ¬£650,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act. In March 2017 Adams lost his appeal against the order to pay ¬£700,000 under the Proceeds of Crime. Act. In November 2017 a district judge sitting in Weston-super-mare ordered Terry Adams to pay the remaining amount within 30 days or return to prison for at least 2.5 years. In December 2017 Adams repaid the entire confiscation order (around ¬£725,000) despite his repeated claims of poverty. He also attempted to gag the press to stop people knowing that he had repaid the confiscation rather than return to jail. A source close to the investigation said that he must have found nearly three-quarters of a million pounds \\"down the back of the sofa.\\" In February 2019, media reports suggested that Terry Adams and his wife were living in a housing association flat. Later that month Terry Adams paid back an additional ¬£50,000 to Westminster Magistrates Court despite claiming poverty to avoid returning to prison for non payment of court costs. Tommy Adams Thomas Sean Adams (born in 1958 in London) is allegedly financier for his brothers Terry and Patrick. A married father of four, he still has a home near the family's traditional Islington base, but was understood to be mainly living in Spain before he was jailed in 2017. Tommy Adams was charged with involvement in the handling of Brink's-MAT gold bullion but in 1985 was cleared of involvement in the laundering of the proceeds during a high-profile Old Bailey trial with co-defendant Kenneth Noye. Tommy Adams is suspected of establishing connections to other international criminal organisations including numerous Yardie gangs as well as gaining an $80 million credit line from Colombian drug cartels. In 1998, Adams was convicted of masterminding a ¬£8 million hashish smuggling operation into Britain for which he was jailed for seven years. At trial he was also ordered to pay an unprecedented ¬£6 million criminal assets embargo, or face an additional five years' imprisonment on top of his seven-year term. On appeal the criminal assets embargo was later reduced by appeal judges to ¬£1m largely due to the CPS not having sufficient material evidence, bank accounts or traceable assets to locate and verify Adams' criminal wealth. Adams' wife, Androulla, paid his ¬£1m criminal assets embargo in cash just two days before the CPS deadline. Tommy was further convicted of money laundering and sentenced to 7 years in 2017 after a number of significant cash seizures of criminal money where linked to him. Money from crime in Manchester was collected and sent to Tommy via trusted associates. Patsy Adams Patrick Daniel John Adams (born 2 February 1956 in London) gained an early reputation in London's underworld by using high-speed motorcycles in gangland murders and was a suspect in at least 25 organised-crime related deaths over a three-year period. He was sentenced to seven years in prison in the 1970s for an armed robbery. Although subordinate to Terry Adams, Patrick ‚Äî sometimes known as Patsy ‚Äî has participated in individual criminal activities. Most notably he is suspected of the 1991 murder attempt on Frankie Fraser; also, according to one account, he assaulted Fraser's son David Fraser with a knife, cutting off part of his ear during a drug deal. During the late 1990s, he was reported to spend much of his time in Spain. The Independent stated in 2001 that he was ‚Äúliving in exile in Spain in a walled villa bristling with security cameras a few miles south of Torremolinos‚Äù. Patrick Adams and his wife were wanted in connection with an attempted murder in Clerkenwell, London on 22 December 2013 and were arrested in Amsterdam on 7 August 2015. Adams admitted shooting Paul Tiernan but he was cleared of attempted murder after the victim refused to cooperate with police because he believed 'loyalty is everything' and said that being called a 'grass' hurt more than being shot. Adams admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent at Woolwich Crown Court and was sentenced to nine years in 2016. Police who searched Adams's flat in the days after the shooting found a handwritten note from Mr Tiernan, 54, which said 'I ain't no f****** grass' and urged his former friend to 'face me'. In an interview in 2020 Paul Tiernan stated that Adams was released from prison earlier in the year. Connections to other gangsters The Adams family have long been connected to the Brink's-Mat robbery and other individuals who helped sell the stolen gold, including Kenneth Noye.

Imagine a Chinese restaurant with an infinite number of circular tables, each with infinite capacity. Customer 1 sits at the first table. The next customer either sits at the same table as customer 1, or the next table. This continues, with each customer choosing to either sit at an occupied table with a probability proportional to the number of customers already there (i.e., they are more likely to sit at a table with many customers than few), or an unoccupied table. At time n, the n customers have been partitioned among m ‚â§ n tables (or blocks of the partition). The results of this process are exchangeable, meaning the order in which the customers sit does not affect the probability of the final distribution. This property greatly simplifies a number of problems in population genetics, linguistic analysis, and image recognition. David J. Aldous attributes the restaurant analogy to Jim Pitman and Lester Dubins in his 1983 book.  Formal definition  At any positive- integer time n, the value of the process is a partition Bn of the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n}, whose probability distribution is determined as follows. At time n = 1, the trivial partition { {1} } is obtained with probability 1. At time n + 1 the element n + 1 is either: # added to one of the blocks of the partition Bn, where each block is chosen with probability |b|/(n + 1) where |bis the size of the block (i.e. number of elements), or # added to the partition Bn as a new singleton block, with probability 1/(n + 1). The random partition so generated has some special properties. It is exchangeable in the sense that relabeling {1, ..., n} does not change the distribution of the partition, and it is consistent in the sense that the law of the partition of n ‚àí 1 obtained by removing the element n from the random partition at time n is the same as the law of the random partition at time n ‚àí 1\\\\. The probability assigned to any particular partition (ignoring the order in which customers sit around any particular table) is : \\\\Pr(B_n = B) = \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{b\\\\in B} (|b-1)!}{n!} where b is a block in the partition B and |bis the size of b. Distribution The Chinese restaurant table distribution (CRT) is the probability distribution on the number of tables in the Chinese restaurant process. It can be understood as the sum of n independent random variables, each with a different Bernoulli distribution: : \\\\begin{align} L & = \\\\sum_{n=1}^m b_n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] b_n & \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Bernoulli} \\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\theta {n-1+\\\\theta}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} The probability mass function of L is given by : f(\\\\ell) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\theta)}{\\\\Gamma(m+\\\\theta)} |s(m,\\\\ell)\\\\theta^\\\\ell where s denotes Stirling numbers of the first kind.  Generalization  This construction can be generalized to a model with two parameters, Œ∏ & Œ±, commonly called the discount and strength (or concentration) parameters. At time n + 1, the next customer to arrive finds |Boccupied tables and decides to sit at an empty table with probability : \\\\frac{\\\\theta + |B\\\\alpha}{n + \\\\theta}, or at an occupied table b of size |bwith probability : \\\\frac{|b- \\\\alpha}{n + \\\\theta}. In order for the construction to define a valid probability measure it is necessary to suppose that either Œ± < 0 and Œ∏ = \\\\- LŒ± for some L ‚àà {1, 2, ...}; or that 0 ‚â§ Œ± < 1 and Œ∏ > ‚àíŒ±. Under this model the probability assigned to any particular partition B of n, in terms of the Pochhammer k-symbol, is : \\\\Pr(B_n = B) = \\\\frac{(\\\\theta + \\\\alpha)_{|B|-1, \\\\alpha}}{(\\\\theta+1)_{n-1, 1}} \\\\prod_{b\\\\in B}(1-\\\\alpha)_{|b|-1, 1} where, by convention, (a)_{0,c} = 1, and for b > 0 : (a)_{b,c} = \\\\prod_{i=0}^{b-1}(a+ic) = \\\\begin{cases} a^b & \\\\text{if }c = 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dfrac{c^b\\\\,\\\\Gamma(a/c + b)}{\\\\Gamma(a/c)} & \\\\text{otherwise}. \\\\end{cases} Thus, for the case when \\\\theta > 0 the partition probability can be expressed in terms of the Gamma function as : \\\\Pr(B_n = B) =\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\theta)}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\theta+n)}\\\\dfrac{\\\\alpha^{|B|}\\\\,\\\\Gamma(\\\\theta/\\\\alpha + |B|) }{\\\\Gamma(\\\\theta/\\\\alpha)}\\\\prod_{b\\\\in B}\\\\dfrac{\\\\Gamma(|b|-\\\\alpha)}{\\\\Gamma(1-\\\\alpha)}. In the one-parameter case, where \\\\alpha is zero, this simplifies to : \\\\Pr(B_n = B) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\theta^{|B|}}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\theta+n)}\\\\prod_{b\\\\in B} \\\\Gamma(|b|). Or, when \\\\theta is zero, : \\\\Pr(B_n = B) =\\\\frac{\\\\alpha^{|B|-1}\\\\,\\\\Gamma(|B|) }\\\\prod_{b\\\\in B} \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(|b|-\\\\alpha)}{\\\\Gamma(1-\\\\alpha)}. As before, the probability assigned to any particular partition depends only on the block sizes, so as before the random partition is exchangeable in the sense described above. The consistency property still holds, as before, by construction. If Œ± = 0, the probability distribution of the random partition of the integer n thus generated is the Ewens distribution with parameter Œ∏, used in population genetics and the unified neutral theory of biodiversity. Animation of a Chinese restaurant process with scaling parameter \\\\theta=0.5,\\\\ \\\\alpha = 0. Tables are hidden once the customers of a table can not be displayed anymore; however, every table has infinitely many seats. (Recording of an interactive animation.)  Derivation  Here is one way to derive this partition probability. Let Ci be the random block into which the number i is added, for i = 1, 2, 3, ... . Then : \\\\Pr(C_i = c\\\\mid C_1,\\\\ldots,C_{i-1}) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{\\\\theta + |B\\\\alpha }{\\\\theta + i -1} & \\\\text{if }c \\\\in \\\\text{new block}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dfrac{|b- \\\\alpha }{\\\\theta + i - 1} & \\\\text{if }c\\\\in b; \\\\end{cases} The probability that Bn is any particular partition of the set { 1, ..., n } is the product of these probabilities as i runs from 1 to n. Now consider the size of block b: it increases by 1 each time we add one element into it. When the last element in block b is to be added in, the block size is (|b‚àí 1). For example, consider this sequence of choices: (generate a new block b)(join b)(join b)(join b). In the end, block b has 4 elements and the product of the numerators in the above equation gets Œ∏ ¬∑ 1 ¬∑ 2 ¬∑ 3\\\\. Following this logic, we obtain Pr(Bn = B) as above.  Expected number of tables  For the one parameter case, with Œ± = 0 and 0 < Œ∏ < ‚àû, the number of tables is distributed according to the chinese restaurant table distribution. The expected value of this random variable, given that there are n seated customers, isXinhua Zhang, \\"A Very Gentle Note on the Construction of Dirichlet Process\\", September 2008, The Australian National University, Canberra. Online: http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xzhang/pubDoc/notes/dirichlet_process.pdf : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\frac \\\\theta {\\\\theta+k-1} = \\\\theta \\\\cdot (\\\\Psi(\\\\theta+n) - \\\\Psi(\\\\theta)) \\\\end{align} where \\\\Psi(\\\\theta) is the digamma function. In the general case (Œ± > 0) the expected number of occupied tables is : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\theta+n+\\\\alpha)\\\\Gamma(\\\\theta+1)}{\\\\alpha \\\\Gamma(\\\\theta+n) \\\\Gamma(\\\\theta+\\\\alpha)} - \\\\frac \\\\theta \\\\alpha, \\\\end{align} however, note that the \\\\Gamma(\\\\cdot) function here is not the standard gamma function. The Indian buffet process It is possible to adapt the model such that each data point is no longer uniquely associated with a class (i.e., we are no longer constructing a partition), but may be associated with any combination of the classes. This strains the restaurant-tables analogy and so is instead likened to a process in which a series of diners samples from some subset of an infinite selection of dishes on offer at a buffet. The probability that a particular diner samples a particular dish is proportional to the popularity of the dish among diners so far, and in addition the diner may sample from the untested dishes. This has been named the Indian buffet process and can be used to infer latent features in data.Griffiths, T.L. and Ghahramani, Z. (2005) Infinite Latent Feature Models and the Indian Buffet Process. Gatsby Unit Technical Report GCNU-TR-2005-001.  Applications  The Chinese restaurant process is closely connected to Dirichlet processes and P√≥lya's urn scheme, and therefore useful in applications of Bayesian statistics including nonparametric Bayesian methods. The Generalized Chinese Restaurant Process is closely related to Pitman‚ÄìYor process.

Altervista Flora Italiana, Aldrovanda vesiculosa L. includes line drawing plus a European distribution map Description The waterwheel is a small, free floating and rootless aquatic plant, with a length of about , and whorls of about in diameter. At every the plant branches, sometimes forming offshoots. An average of 12 to 19 whorls spans the length of the plant, each with about 5 to 9 leaves, each up to long. The growth is faster than terrestrial carnivorous plants, sometimes growing about a day. In temperate regions the plant goes dormant in the winter, forming turions of about and sinking to the bottom. In tropical regions, the plant grows all year long without forming turions. The plant flourishes and produces seeds only in these warmer regions, with temperatures higher than , and produces only one flower, white or light pink, that arises above the surface. In temperate regions, the plant reproduces mostly via asexual means, producing inviable seeds or no flower at all. The leaf structure is very similar to the Dionaea (commonly known as the Venus flytrap), the main difference being air chambers present in the \\"stem\\". The traps, at the end of the leaf, contains up to 6 bristles, analog to the Dionaea teeths, that prevents debris from activating the trap. Each trap contains additional 60‚Äì80 smaller \\"teeth\\", and circa 30‚Äì40 trigger hairs inside. The speed of closing is about 0.01 to 0.02 seconds. Trap mechanism The trap mechanism is akin to that present in Dionaea - Darwin even named it \\"the miniature aquatic Dionaea\\". The mechanism by which the trap snaps shut involves a complex interaction between elasticity, turgor and growth. In the open, untripped state, the lobes are convex (bent outwards), but in the closed state, the lobes are concave (forming a cavity). It is the rapid flipping of this bistable state that closes the trap, but the mechanism by which this occurs is still poorly understood. When the trigger hairs are stimulated, an action potential (mostly involving calcium ions‚Äîsee calcium in biology) is generated, which propagates across the lobes and stimulates cells in the lobes and in the midrib between them. Extinct relatives The extinct species are known only from fossil pollen and seeds, with the exception of A. inopinata, which is also known from fossilised laminae. Aldrovanda was for a long time thought to be related to the Late Cretaceous form taxon Palaeoaldrovanda splendens, but research published in 2010 suggests that remains attributed to Palaeoaldrovanda actually represent fossilised insect eggs. Evolution The organ of carnivory in Aldrovanda is the snap trap. Snap traps are only found in one other carnivorous plant genus, Dionaea. The two genera have been shown to share a most recent common ancestor by analysis of combined nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences. When sequences of chloroplast DNA of Aldrovanda, Dionaea, and Drosera were analyzed alone, however, Aldrovanda and Drosera (sundews) were shown to share a most recent common ancestor. It has been proposed that this discrepancy between gene trees based on nuclear and cytoplasmic DNA analyses can be explained by chloroplast capture, as similar inconsistencies have been explained by this phenomenon.  Conservation  Aldrovanda vesiculosa is listed as ‚ÄúEndangered‚Äù on the IUCN Red List.

Practicums (student teaching) are common for education and social work majors. In some cases, the practicum may be a part-time student teaching placement that occurs the semester before a student's full-time student teaching placement. The process resembles an internship; however, a practicum focuses on observation over work experience. In the case of student teaching placements within the United States, students gain insight into the professional responsibilities of classroom teachers by working under the direct supervision of experienced, state-licensed educators. Student educators work directly with cooperating teachers to plan and implement effective lessons using a variety of teaching strategies and methods to provide differentiated instruction within classrooms and meet the needs of diverse students. To ensure the safety of students and faculty members, background checks are required and must be completed before any teaching candidate can begin their practicum experience.

She is one of the most significant artistes to emerge from the 1990s. A singer-songwriter par excellence, she is known to perform songs from the rich heritage of folk music in Bengal, besides her own compositions. She is also deeply regarded as one of the foremost music researchers in Kolkata and working across Bengal, the eastern Indian states and Bangladesh. Her essays have been published in both English and Bengali in journals, both international as well as regional. Her songs are usually considered to belong to the \\"modern\\" song type. One of her song, 'Ami Sunechi Sedin Tumi' ('‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶∂‡ßÅ‡¶®‡ßá‡¶õ‡¶ø ‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶® ‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶ø') enjoy great popularity in Bengali-speaking areas of India, Bangladesh and London. Works Moushumi Bhowmik formed a band named Parapar in 2002 with members from Kolkata and London. Their music is built around the voice of singer- songwriter Moushumi Bhowmik and draws its repertoire both from Moushumi's own compositions and the rich folk heritage of Bengal. The band aims to stress the continuity between diverse musical traditions‚Äì kirtan, bhatiyali, adhunik, the blues and both Indian and Western classical music‚Äì blending them into a subtle and distinctive musical language. They also draw upon folk material collected by Moushumi from West Bengal, Assam and Bangladesh. As of 2010, the lineup consists of Moushumi Bhowmik (Vocals), Oliver Weeks (Guitar), Ros Acton (Cello), Ben Hillyard (Bass), Derek Scurll (Drums) and Satyaki Banerjee (Dotara).

Stribling. He won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1933 for his novel The Store. Life Born March 4, 1881, in Clifton, Tennessee, a small town off the Tennessee River, Thomas Sigismund Stribling was the first child of lawyer Christopher Columbus Stribling and his wife, Amelia Ann (Waits) Stribling. Christopher Stribling had been a soldier in the Union Army, while the Waits family had fought in the Confederacy. T.S. Stribling would later say this resulted in his being a \\"doubter and a questioner\\" (Bain, 433). He would go on to use the stories of his parents, grandparents and extended family on both sides to create the realistic depth of his Southern Reconstruction novels. Stribling completed his high school education at the age of seventeen, at Huntingdon Southern Normal University in 1899, in the nearby town of Huntingdon, Tennessee. By this time Stribling was convinced that he was meant to be a writer, having already sold his first story at the age of 12 for five dollars; Stribling was ready to get started with his future in literature. With that in mind, Stribling became the editor of a small weekly newspaper called the Clifton News. Stribling was hoping to use the Clifton News as a launching pad for his writing career, unfortunately Stribling was only there for about a year before his parents convinced him to return to school and complete his education. In the fall of 1902, Stribling graduated from the Florence Normal School, what is now recognized as the University of North Alabama, in Florence, Alabama. There, Stribling was able to earn his teaching certification in one year. In 1903, Stribling moved to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to teach at the Tuscaloosa High School. He taught both mathematics and physical education. He actually only taught at the school for one year, having \\"no idea whatever of discipline\\" (Kunitz, 1359) before departing, preferring instead to continue his own education. In 1905, Stribling completed his law degree at the University of Alabama School of Law. Yet again he only used his newly earned education for a brief time, moving quickly from law office to law office: The Florence law office of George Jones, serving as clerk; the Florence law office of Governor Emmett O'Neal, where Stribling worked as a practicing lawyer; and law office of John Ashcraft, also as a practicing lawyer. Stribling went through three law offices in less than two years. It turns out that instead of working on clients' cases, Stribling was in fact using the office supplies, typewriter, and paid hours to perfect his writing craft. Under the advice of his fellow lawyers, Stribling gave up practicing law in 1907. Writing career The March 1927 Amazing Stories cover-featured a reprint of Stribling's \\"The Green Splotches\\" After moving to Nashville, Tennessee in 1907, Stribling picked up a job at the Taylor-Trotwood Magazine as a writer and salesman of ads and subscriptions and as \\"a sort of sublimated office boy.\\" (Kunitz, 1359) It was at the magazine that Stribling had two works of fiction published: The Imitator and The Thrall of the Green, both reflecting the social themes for which he would later become renowned. Repeating his pattern and encouraged by his small success, Stribling left the magazine in 1908. He then moved to New Orleans where he produced \\"Sunday-school stories at the phenomenal rate of seven per day; many of these stories were eventually published by denominational publishing houses.\\" (Martine, 73) Stribling went on to write many more Sunday-school stories as well as adventure stories for boys that were printed in various pulp magazines such as The American Boy, Holland's Magazine, The Youth's Companion, Adventure and Everybody's Magazine. These writings afforded Stribling to, for the first time, live off the profits of his creative ability. For Adventure, Stribling wrote detective stories featuring his psychologist sleuth Doctor Poggioli.DeAndrea, William. \\"Stribling, T(homas) S(igismund)\\" in Encyclopedia Mysteriosa. MacMillan, 1994 (p. 342). Stribling also wrote some science fiction stories with satirical undertones, such as \\"The Green Splotches\\" (1920), about aliens in South America, and \\"Mogglesby\\" (1930), featuring intelligent apes.Moskowitz, Sam. \\"T. S. Stribling, Subliminal Science-Fictionist\\". Fantasy Commentator, Winter 1989/1990 (pp. 230-243, 277-296). In 1917, The Cruise of the Dry Dock was published in a limited print run of 250 copies. This was Stribling's first effort at a novel. It most likely was heavily influenced by his boy-like adventure writings for his various pulp magazines. It was a World War I seaborne adventure story set in the German infested waters of the Sargasso Sea, where the American crew tries to escape capture and certain death by the hands of the evil enemy. \\"A potboiler, The Cruise of the Dry Dock is neither in its style nor its choice of subject matter particularly original or impressive.\\" (Martine, 73) Serialized in seven parts in Century Magazine, Birthright was collected into novel form in 1922. This is considered to be Stribling's first serious novel as well as being the work that introduces to the world his ability to reconstruct not only the landscape of the South, but the heartache as well. Birthright was highly praised by critics in both the black and white communities. Birthright is the story of a young African American (mulatto) man, Peter Siner, who returns home after completing his education at Harvard; he is hoping to effect some changes and to heal racial rifts in his small southern home town of Hooker's Bend, Tennessee. He fails to heal the social rift of the community because of the wide and dividing prejudices of both the white and black man. In defeat, Peter ends up moving to another small town just north of the Dixie Line. Birthright was a major departure from the pulp adventure stories for which Stribling was thus far characteristically known. Birthright is a serious social critique of not only the social practices of the South, but all of America‚Äîits social rules, taboos and even laws such as the Jim Crow laws or the Tennessee-initiated Segregation Seating Act for Railroad Cars in 1881, which paved the way for other states and the creation of other related laws. This novel also reflects historical populace movements such as \\"The Great Migration\\". World War I had broken out in Europe, and although America was not yet fighting in the war, the nation was supplying goods for the war; in response, the Northern manufacturers recruited Southern black workers to fill the demand for factory workers. \\"From 1910 to 1930 between 1.5 million and 2 million African Americans left the South for the industrial cities of the North.\\" (Encarta Encyclopedia 2003) It is from these times that the South, as well as America, is trying to heal the social fault; it may be this America that Peter Siner is supposed to embody. During the time that Stribling was writing his adventure stories for the various pulp magazines, he was also doing some world travel, going through Europe, Cuba and Venezuela. It was in Venezuela that Stribling formed the inspiration for the novels Fombombo (1923), Red Sand (1924), and Strange Moon (1929). All three are set in Venezuela, and all three focus on the different class levels of Venezuela, with a touch of a love and adventure thrown into the stories. All three are considered to be the lighter, \\"fun\\" reading of Stribling's works. Teeftallow (1926) and Brightmetal (1928) are both novels returning to what Stribling would eventually be well known for: the social satire of middle Tennessee. Both novels are set in middle Tennessee and even share some of the same characters. These novels approach the problems of the South through the eyes of the middle class and the poor of the local white people. Neither won any high critical praise, but both were well received by the reading community. The Vaiden Trilogy 1930 was a highly significant year for Stribling. It was the year he produced his eleventh novel, The Forge (1931), the first book of his trilogy following the Vaiden family. Further, the same year he married Lou Ella Kloss, a music teacher and hometown friend. Set in Florence, Alabama, this trilogy follows three generations of the Vaiden family. \\"Through not great literary art, Stribling's trilogy is, nevertheless, historically significant; for in The Forge, The Store, and Unfinished Cathedral, Stribling introduced a subject matter, themes, plot elements, and character types which parallel and at the same time anticipate those that William Faulkner, who owned copies of this trilogy, would treat in Absalom, Absalom! and in the Snopes trilogy.\\" (Martine, 76) These three novels represent the best of Stribling and his ability to call forth the Southern landscapes, as well as the Southern heartaches during the period of the Civil War restoration. The Forge follows the story of Miltiades Vaiden who served in the Civil War and has now returned to his homeland in hopes of picking up again his family's yeoman tradition and rebuilding the now destroyed south that he remembers with longing. Finding work, Vaiden soon also finds the woman that he wishes to marry, not out of love or even lust, but as a means to reach his dreams. The girl rejects him, instead choosing to marry a richer man with political ambitions. Vaiden does not miss a beat; he instead marries another girl, middle-class Ponny BeShears, who he does not find especially attractive, but she will gain a nice inheritance when her father passes away, which he hopes will be enough to move him into the middle-class. Stribling's most famous novel, the Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning The Store (1932), is the second book in The Vaiden Trilogy. Returning to the story of Miltiades Vaiden, several years have passed since the closing of The Forge. Where the first novel opened up at the beginning of the Civil War and ended with the abolition of slavery, The Store picks up with the South establishing a new economic order. Throughout the course of the novel, Vaiden cultivates a reputation for honesty and square dealing, as well as choosing opportune moments to lie and steal. His successes and failures in the arena of commerce contribute much to the dynamics of the storyline. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Vaiden long ago raped a young black girl working on his land, Gracie, whose father was Jimmie Vaiden, Miltiades' own father. Gracie became pregnant with a boy and named him Toussaint, never revealing the truth of his parentage to the boy or to Vaiden. Keeping her son with her and educating him over the course of his life has been beneficial to the young man, and Gracie quietly hopes that Toussaint, who appears to be white, will some day be able to travel north, pass as a white man, and marry a white woman. Toussaint's behavior and \\"uppity\\" attitude are a central point of tension throughout the story. The final book in the trilogy is The Unfinished Cathedral (1934). Again set in Florence, now in the 1920s and focusing still on the Vaiden family. President Hoover has enacted the Tennessee Valley Authority works in order to supply electricity to the nearby towns. This has caused a real estate boom in the small Alabama town, where the now well aged Vaiden wants to take full advantage of this boom. Anyone who can read already knows about the coming dam and the coming housing boom, so the people that have even a little money go after the people that are left out of the loop, the local blacks. The local whites offer these uneducated black people sums of money they can't refuse, or simply run them off their land, or find other means to cheat them out of their land. Repeating the cycle of his father, the younger Vaiden son has repeated his father's acts by raping the mulatto girl that works in their house‚Ä¶not knowing that the girl is actually his half sister, getting her pregnant with a son. The girl and her son run off north in hopes of finding something better for themselves. The boy then ends up in jail, where his Vaiden grandfather has to come rescue him. Meanwhile, the town pastor has also gotten caught up in the fever of all the materialism around town. This is reflected in his ignoring the spiritual needs of the townspeople and instead putting his focus on building a great cathedral. Stribling's last two novels are set far away from the rural south in New York City and in Washington, D.C. The Sound Wagon (1935), a political novel set in both cities, is a look at America's political system and ideals. Like The Vaiden Trilogy, the novel is a satire. The main character is a young lawyer named Henry Caridius who goes to Washington, D.C. in hopes of making great changes and fails, very similar to the plot of Birthright. These Bars of Flesh (1938), Stribling's last book, is set in New York City. This novel may have been a reaction to Stribling's own time teaching English at Columbia University in 1935. The novel is set in a NYC university with Andrew Barnett attending from Georgia hoping to attain his degree. Stribling takes a satiric look at campus politics, professor tenure and education, and the amount of the students' lack of awareness. After his last novel, Stribling continued to write mysteries for various magazines. These were eventually collected: The Best of Dr. Poggioli, 1934-1940 (1975). Stribling and his wife returned to his hometown of Clifton to live in 1959. During his final months, when he was in declining health, the couple stayed in Florence, where he died on July 8, 1965. He is buried in Clifton, and the town has turned the Striblings' home into a museum and library devoted to his life and career. His autobiography, Laughing Stock: The Posthumous Autobiography of T.S. Stribling, was compiled by Randy Cross, a doctoral student at the University of Mississippi in 1982. References *Bain, Robert, comp. and ed. Southern Writers: A Biographical Dictionary.

From the 1940 premiere of Gone with the Wind through the 1980s Star Wars episodes, the Chateau provided Rochester the very best in cinema. The Preservation Alliance of Minnesota calls the Chateau Theatre Minnesota's \\"last and best example of 'atmospheric theater.\\"' Its principal architecture is Art Deco, a design popularized first in Europe and later the U.S. (most famously in Hollywood and Miami) from the mid-1920s to the late 1930s. The original theatre mezzanine and inner lobby are gone; all that remains are the railings and doorways to the restrooms and lounge areas. Originally, the main theatre floor had raked seating; that is, with the rows farther from the stage rising toward the rear. The theatre originally had 1,487 red velvet seats, compared to today's \\"theaters,\\" which generally seat 200 at most. The original film projection booth sits above the second floor balcony, hidden behind the giant Barnes & Noble mural. Because of the theatre's historic nature and a desire not to disturb its decorative side walls ‚Äî which replicate an early French (Normandy) village ‚Äî the floor is attached only at the building's front and back walls while also supported by main floor pillars. The castle, with 40 balconies and turrets, resembles a 10th-century French castle (chateau). Originally passageways extended for actors to appear at the numerous windows and balconies. The theatre when it was a Barnes & Noble bookstore The theatre ceiling is still the same dark blue as the original. The constellations, which once twinkled as dramatic scenes gradually changed from day to night, are still visible although difficult to see because of the larger spotlights later installed by Barnes & Noble. In addition to a \\"moon machine,\\" also still present but no longer functioning is a cloud machine, once used to project shadows of clouds across the ceiling. The pipe organ playing for melodrama and silent movies was located on the west side of the current children's book section; organ pipes were housed in the castle gate. The proscenium arch at the top of the escalator rises above the Chateau Theatre's former stage, which measured across and along with the organ rose to audience eye level at the start of each performance. Along with multiple dressing rooms, backstage included metal stairs climbing five flights, with showers and toilets at every other level. In 1979 the \\"World Wide Friends of the Chateau\\" was formed and was instrumental in preserving the theatre from demolition. Although the theatre was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, it closed on October 2, 1983, with the 1934 movie classic It Happened One Night, starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. Following nearly eleven years of debate. negotiation, and ultimately $4 million of renovation, Barnes & Noble reopened the doors of the Chateau Theatre on July 1, 1994. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. On January 2, 2015, the Barnes & Noble inside the Chateau Theatre closed.

A followspot is any lighting instrument manually controlled by an operator during a performance. Generally a followspot will be a dedicated, large lighting instrument designed to pan and change size, beam width, and color easily by hand. Followspot controls *Choppers ‚Äì Cuts or shutters the top and bottom part of the beam. *Douser ‚Äì Controls intensity. *Iris ‚Äì Controls beam size. *Trombone ‚Äì Controls focal length. *Color frames ‚Äì Changes the color of the light. May also known as a boomerang and/or a color magazine. Color magazines contain the color gels, which are counted from the rear of the follow spot forward. Cueing The way the lead follow-spotter will cue you is by saying \\"Spot(s) 2 (and 3) on [actor/actress](s) in a frame 2 (sometimes it's more than one color at once) with a half douser.\\" It may seem confusing at first, but usually you will have a cue sheet in front of you so you know your cues and you get them right. Getting the cues right is one thing, but making sure you aim and shoot the follow spot in the right place is key too. Positioning & Cuing In professional Theatre, Auditoriums Arenas, Amphitheaters, Coliseums, Convention Centers, Performing Art Centers community and/or school theaters, Spot Ops may use a special tool called a Telrad. A Telrad is a cue alignment tool that came from Telescope's Finderscope. This tool device helps the Operator to align the follow spot, before any light leaves the follow spot (with the dowser closed in a pre-cue position) and/or for location reference during stage shots where the spotlight might become hard to see due to overall illumination of the stage, or when two spots lights are overlapping their respective assigned subjects. The operator when looking through a Telrad, will see multiple red ring circles (which can be dimmed to assist in low level lighting), this assists in aiming the follow spot. Especially for tight pick up cues where there is a high need for precision, with little stray light spilling over and onto the surrounds environment. Often times the placement location's distance and alignment of the Telrad's housing unit on the spotlight, in relation to the operator's eyes, will allow the rings to help align with the standard sizes of head shot, half body , full body shot. The spot light operator is able to use the device with both eyes open due to the Bindon aiming concept which the brain can impose the red reticle into the combined vision from both eyes. Prior to usage and availability of these Red dot sight style devices, various methods were and are still used. Such as using a small piece of pipe visually limit the area seen to small area and/or making homemade out of various stiff wire (sometimes spent carbon rods from use in Carbon-Arc older Follow Spotlights) to create a crosshair style sights, similar to ones seen on early anti-aircraft guns. There were also sets of magnets, and various other items attached, used to create a sight pattern to assist in aligning the spot light. Another earlier method and still in use is to use a dry erase board, Sheets of paper placed on the wall, colored or white electrical (or gaffer's) tape , that are then have the light leak shape drawn upon them with a label. Making the original outline traces of the light leaks when the spotlight was in the correct position and was set up during rehearsals . Which the placement of these marks are located behind and/or above the rear of the spotlight to use. During normal operation these small amounts of light that escape the Follow Spot housing, moving as the rear's position changes in reference to the front lenses, which the audience does not see, nor are distracted by them. When the small light leak is aligned inside their cue marks on the board, paper, or tape, the spotlight would be in the predetermined position aligned realitive to the pick up position. Allowing operator to pick up their intended cue more preciously, without having to ghost on (to slightly open the dowser to see the light on stage to confirm position, which can be disrupting to the audience and/or illuminate the stage when in blackout). These options aid the spotlight operator in finding their cue marks from distances far away from the stage. The usage of aiming devices for precision is used more in theatre style shows than in various musical Concerts in Arenas, Amphitheaters, Coliseums,etc. The various distances of Spot Light Location set up positioning based on the venue's size and the spot locations, may also effect the need for devices to assist in aiming.

Its main span is long, and the total length of the bridge is . The bridge was designed by Modjeski and Masters and was open to traffic on November 25, 1931. Tolls were collected from the opening of the bridge until 1945. The bridge was closed for rehabilitation in 2003 and 2004 after the William H. Harsha Bridge was completed. URS Corp. prepared the rehabilitation plans which consisted of a deck replacement, structural steel repairs, a new inspection walkway, and a new handrail on the main spans. The bridge was painted and returned to its original color, silver. It was rumored that the bridge was painted green during World War II to help 'disguise' it from air attacks. National Engineering and Contracting Company completed the construction and painting for the rehabilitation at a cost of $5.7 million. In July 2019, The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet ordered a 3-ton weight limit placed on the bridge after a routine inspection found significant safety hazards with the cable suspension system. In November 2019, the bridge was closed due to corrosion in the suspension cable connectors. The bridge is expected to be repaired and put back in service by April 15, 2020. As of May 21, 2020,The bridge remained closed after a inspection of the cable repairs determined that the bridge needed trust-proofing. On June 12, 2020, the bridged reopened for traffic with a 15-ton weight restriction after being closed for nearly 6-months so a short-term fix could be done to reduce stress on 19 damaged cables and rust coated.

Prisons =Alcatraz= Alcatraz is a real- life island prison in San Francisco Bay that was operational in 1859‚Äì1963. It held superhuman criminals in special section in the 1940s; the designation \\"the Alcatraz Annex\\" has been used in various Marvel handbooks to distinguish it from Alcatraz in general. First mentioned in Marvel Mystery Comics #26 (1941), when the android Human Torch's foe the Parrot was being transported there. Later seen in Human Torch #8 (1942), when the golden age Angel's foe the Python escaped. During the \\"Dark Reign\\" storyline, Alcatraz was occupied by H.A.M.M.E.R., who used it as a detention center for the mutants that the Dark Avengers apprehended. During the \\"AXIS\\" storyline, Iron Man used Alcatraz as the site of Stark Island. =Alamogordo= Alamogordo is a nuclear testing facility in New Mexico that held the Armageddon Man and perhaps others in suspended animation. First appeared in X-Men vol. 2 #12 (1992). =Big House= see Lang Memorial Penitentiary =Cage= Based on a remote island in international waters, the Cage is a prison that uses a special forcefield to deprive inmates of their superhuman powers. The Cage was home to four prison gangs: a group of Maggia loyalists, the Skulls (a white supremacist gang loyal to the Red Skull), the Brothers (a black prison gang), and the Cruisers (a cabal of sexual predators who preyed on the other inmates as best as they could). The Cage was later shut down and its role was replaced by the Raft. Mystique was imprisoned in The Cage for one day before she escaped in All-New X-Men #14. Created by writer Frank Tieri and artist Sean Chen in the pages of Wolverine #164 (2001). =Crossmore Prison= Crossmore Prison is Her (Britannic) Majesty's Ultimate Security Prison that was previously known as Crossmoor. Deadpool and Juggernaut were known inmates here. =Cube= The Cube is a prison for super-powered beings such as Hulk, Abomination, Absorbing Man, and Leader. Its location is undisclosed and only high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agents know of its existence. It has a special program where prisoners are brainwashed to become obedient soldiers. The Cube was created by writer Grant Morrison and artist J. G. Jones in Marvel Boy #6 (2000). When last seen in Civil War: Young Avengers & Runaways #4, Marvel Boy had taken control of the entire facility. During the Dark Reign storyline, the Cube served as the Thunderbolts' base of operations. Cube in other media In The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the Cube is a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison for gamma-powered supervillains like Leader, Abomination, Absorbing Man, Madman, the U-Foes, the Wrecking Crew, Bi-Beast, Radioactive Man, and Zzzax before a mysterious technological fault allowed them to escape. In the two-part episode \\"Gamma World\\", the Leader used the Cube as a staging ground to turn the world into gamma monsters before the Avengers defeated him. =Ice Box= The Ice Box is a Canadian maximum security prison. The Ice Box held a crime lord named Ivan the Terrible. The Ice Box first appeared in Maverick #8. It also appeared in the 2018 film Deadpool 2, housing mutant fugitives such as Deadpool, Rusty Collins, Black Tom Cassidy, and Juggernaut. =Lang Memorial Penitentiary= Also known as the Pym Experimental Prison #1 (and ironically dubbed \\"The Big House\\"), inmates in the Lang Memorial Penitentiary are shrunk down using Pym Particles for cheaper storage and easier control. It is also known as the Ant-Hill due to operators using versions of the Ant-Man helmet to influence ants to act as security within the prison. Known inmates of the facility were 8-Ball, Absorbing Man, Dragon Man, Electro, Figment, Grey Gargoyle, Mad Thinker, Mandrill, Rhino, Sandman, Scarecrow, Scorpion, Silencer, Southpaw, Titania, Tiger Shark, the U-Foes (Ironclad, Vapor, Vector, X-Ray), Vermin, Whirlwind, and the Wrecking Crew (Wrecker, Bulldozer, Piledriver, Thunderball). The Big House in other media The Big House appears in the animated series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. First introduced in the eponymous micro-series episode \\"The Big House\\" (later incorporated into the first-season episode, \\"The Man in the Ant Hill\\"), it is established as a miniaturized prison for superhuman criminals developed by Hank Pym for S.H.I.E.L.D., housed inside a single room on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Helicarrier and internally maintained by benign incarnations of Ultron. Some of its most notable inmates include the Mad Thinker, Whirlwind, Grey Gargoyle, and members of the Serpent Society. The placement within the Helicarrier proves disastrous in the series premiere, \\"Breakout\\", as a massive prison escape across several superhuman penitentiaries results in the Big House growing to full size, causing enough internal damage to cause the Helicarrier to crash. =Project Pegasus= Created in Marvel Two-in- One #42 (August, 1978) by writers Mark Gruenwald and Ralph Macchio, Project Pegasus (Potential Energy Group, Alternate Sources, United States) was originally intended to research alternative (and unusual) forms of energy. It was later used as a prison for super-powered individuals with energy-based powers. It was originally located in the Adirondack Mountains, New York. Several heroes have served terms working security at the facility, including the Thing and Quasar. At one time, it also served as a temporary home for the Squadron Supreme when they were exiled from their own universe. In the Ultimate Marvel reality, P.E.G.A.S.U.S. appeared in the series Ultimate Power.Ultimate Power #1 This Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S was located in Devil's Point, Wyoming. It was a S.H.I.E.L.D. program that served to store all objects of mysterious origin or unexplained power that United States authorities had accumulated over the years, in which every precaution was made to keep the objects safe. Originally, Project Pegasus was the center of \\"S.H.I.E.L.D.'s universe\\" (something that the recent directors of S.H.I.E.L.D., Carol Danvers and Nick Fury, were completely unaware of). It was later reduced to a storage house, but still kept some of the original facility which included an underground laboratory.Ultimate Comics: Doom #3 Project Pegasus was attacked two times by the Serpent Squad, who had come for the Serpent Crown that was stored there, and was protected by the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Iceman, and Rick Jones.Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man #8 P.E.G.A.S.U.S. also housed the Watcher Uatu after it was discovered by American personnel at Project Rebirth, until Uatu was \\"activated\\" and forewarned the Fantastic Four, Carol Danvers, and P.E.G.A.S.U.S.'s overseer, Wendell Vaughn, about an upcoming cataclysm before it disappeared.Ultimate Origin #5 Following the events of Ultimatum, Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. was put on alert in the wake of unexplained attacks on the Baxter Building and Roxxon Industries. P.E.G.A.S.U.S.'s personnel were aided by Captain Mahr-Vehl, but Mahr-Vehl was infected with an unknown virus and went berserk, attacking P.E.G.A.S.U.S. personnel. Mahr-Vehl was transported away by Rick Jones/Nova, but that left Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. vulnerable. It was invaded by the true instigator of the attacks, Reed Richards, who pilfered the facility's valuable possessions.Ultimate Comics: Doom #2Ultimate Comics: Mystery #3 Project Pegasus in other media * Project: Pegasus appears in Iron Man Armored Adventures, led by Russian scientist Anton Harchov. In this version, Project: Pegasus is an energy research facility located in New York City and is responsible for creating the Crimson Dynamo armor using Ivan Vanko as a pilot. It later becomes absorbed into Stark International under Obadiah Stane, who uses his head of security, O'Brien, to helm a new version of the Dynamo armor. * P.E.G.A.S.U.S. appears in media related to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ** In Captain Marvel, it is a joint venture between the United States Air Force and NASA housed at an Air Force base before S.H.I.E.L.D. took over the Air Force's position, to investigate phenomena beyond the range of conventional scientific understanding. Both major contributors provided scientific expertise to the project, and due to the highly sensitive nature of the research conducted there, S.H.I.E.L.D. also provided its security force. It is also where Dr. Wendy Lawson experimented on a new drive to help transport a group of refugee Skrulls. Project: P.E.G.A.S.U.S. played host to the Tesseract for many years. ** By the early 21st century and the events of Thor, S.H.I.E.L.D. had determined that it was an incredible source of energy, but found no way to tap it. This changed when S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury found Culver University Professor Erik Selvig, and brought him in to investigate the object. Upon seeing it, he was influenced by Loki to help them. ** As of The Avengers, Selvig came to a rudimentary understanding of the Tesseract's capabilities. Following an attack by Loki however, Project: P.E.G.A.S.U.S. was hastily evacuated, though the unrestrained energies released from Loki's escape erupted and consumed the Project: P.E.G.A.S.U.S. facility, leaving a vast crater in its wake. =The Raft= The Raft is a fictional prison facility for super-human criminals (predominantly supervillains) in the Marvel Universe. Created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist David Finch, it first appeared in The New Avengers #1 (2005) as the \\"Maximum-Maximum Security\\" wing of the Ryker's Island Maximum Security Penitentiary. The Raft is introduced as the setting of a large-scale prison break, with the New Avengers being concerned when their analysis of computer records shows that some of the Raft's inmates are listed as having been dead for years. One of the former guards notes that the prison developed various 'hierarchies', with prisoners congregating with those inmates who shared some aspect of their powers or nature, such as Crossfire forming a small gang consisting of himself, Controller, Corruptor, Mandrill and Mister Fear, due to the fact that all of them relied on manipulating the minds of others. The Raft is the setting of a multi-part story in Spider-Man's Tangled Web featuring Tombstone as a villain- protagonist. The Raft was later converted into Spider-Island Two by Otto Octavius (in Peter Parker's body) until it was destroyed by the Goblin King. The Raft in other media * The Raft appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, with known inmates including the likes of Graviton, Heinrich Zemo, Wendigo, and Purple Man. * The Raft appears as a level in Lego Marvel Super Heroes. Sabretooth and Mystique break in to start a prison riot and free Magneto, though the riot is contained by Iron Man, Hulk, and Wolverine, who capture Sabretooth while Magneto and Mystique escape. * The Raft appears in media connected to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ** In the 2016 film Captain America: Civil War, the Raft is first seen with Thaddeus Ross serving as a warden. Sam Wilson, Wanda Maximoff, Clint Barton and Scott Lang are remanded to the prison after helping Steve Rogers and the Winter Soldier evade capture, which was in violation of the Sokovia Accords.

After being taken to the area of Earth's Moon where the Skrulls had created the artificial atmosphere, the Kree used their strength and rudimentary Skrull technology to create a giant city, while the Cotati were taken to another barren world in a different solar system where they created a long-term sustainable ecosystem. Learning that the Cotati were going to win the contest, the enraged Kree first slaughtered the Cotati and then attacked and killed the Skrull delegation, stole their starship, and initiated the millennia-long conflict now known as the Kree-Skrull War, which would force the Skrulls to become a society of warriors.Avengers (vol. 1) #133 (March 1975) The Blue Area of the Moon was also the home of Uatu the Watcher and a brief location for Attilan. * Birj: The sixth moon of Marman (see above) and where Terrax is from. * Titan: The main moon of Saturn and technologically advanced home to the Titan Eternals.

While experiments have demonstrated the possibility of cellular memory there are currently no known means by which tissues other than the brain would be capable of storing memories. Modern usage of BM tends to frame it exclusively in the context of traumatic memory and ways in which the body responds to recall of a memory. In this regard, it has become relevant in treatment for PTSD.  Overview  Peter Levine calls BM implicit memory or more specifically procedural memory, things that the body is capable of doing automatically and not in one's consciousness. He clarifies 3 types of BM and frames his work in terms of traumatic memory consequence and resolution: #Learned motor actions - Action patterns that can be continuously modified over time by higher brain regions. #Emergency response - Hardwired instinctual behaviors (i.e., fight or flight response, etc...). #Attraction or repulsion - We are attracted to sources of nourishment and growth and repulsed from sources of injury or toxicity. Nicola Diamond elaborates on the opinion of philosopher Merleau-Ponty and asserts that BM is formed by doing. Whether practicing a bodily activity or forming a reaction to a traumatic memory. Edward Casey speaks of BM as, \\"memory intrinsic to the body, how we remember by and through the body\\", rather than what is remembered about the body. Thomas Fuchs defines 6 different types of BM: procedural, situational, intercorporeal, incorporative, pain, and traumatic memory. He notes that they are not strictly separable from one another but \\"derived from different dimensions of bodily experience. Michelle Summa further refines this definition as an implicit memory. A pre-thematic, operative consciousness of the past expressed through the body. Antonio Damasio calls these reactions to memories somatic markers or emotions that are expressed primarily as physical feelings. These memories are often associated with phantom pain in a part or parts of the body ‚Äì the body appearing to remember the past trauma. The idea of body memory is a belief frequently associated with the idea of repressed memories, in which memories of incest or sexual abuse can be retained and recovered through physical sensations. It may also be associated with phantom limb sensation but this is less common.  Skepticism  In 1993, Susan E. Smith, presented a paper relating the idea of \\"Survivor Psychology\\" at a false memory syndrome conference, stated about BM that, \\"body memories are thought to literally be emotional, kinesthetic, or chemical recordings stored at the cellular level and retrievable by returning to or recreating the chemical, emotional, or kinesthetic conditions under which the memory recordings are filed. She went on in the abstract of the paper, \\"one of the most commonly used theories to support the ideology of repressed memories or incest and sexual abuse amnesia is body memories.\\" and \\"The belief in these pseudoscientific concepts appears to be related to scientific illiteracy, gullibility, and a lack of critical thinking skills and reasoning abilities in both the mental health community and in society at large\\" A 2017 systematic review of cross-disciplinary research in body memory found that the available data neither largely support or refute the claim that memories are stored outside of the brain and more research is needed. In the Encyclopedia of Phenomenology Embree notes that, \\"To posit body memory is to open up a Pandora's Box\\", and links the idea to physical associations of memory rather than as a memory stored in a bodily manner.  Cellular memory  Cellular memory (CM) is a parallel hypothesis to BM positing that memories can be stored outside the brain in all cells. The idea that non-brain tissues can have memories is believed by some who have received organ transplants, though this is considered impossible. The author said the stories are intriguing though and may lead to some serious scientific investigation in the future. In his book TransplantNation Douglas Vincent suggests that atypical newfound memories, thoughts, emotions and preferences after an organ transplant are more suggestive of immunosuppressant drugs and the stress of surgery on perception than of legitimate memory transference. In other words, \\"as imaginary as a bad trip on LSD or other psychotropic drug.\\"  Flatworms  Biologists at Tufts University have been able to train flatworms despite the loss of the brain and head. This may show memory stored in other parts of the body in some animals. A worm reduced to 1/279th of the original can be regrown within a few weeks and be trained much quicker to head towards light and open space for food, an unnatural behavior for a flatworm. With each head removed training times appear reduced. This may just be a sign of epigenetics showing the appearance of memory. However, in the 1950s and 1960s James McConnell flatworm experiments measured how long it took to learn a maze. McConnell trained some to move around a maze and then chopped them up and fed them to untrained worms. The untrained group learned faster compared to a control that had not been fed trained worms. McConnell believed the experiment indicated cellular memory. The training involved stressing the worms with electric shock. This kind of stress releases persistent hormones and shows no evidence for memory transfer. Similar experiments with mice being trained and being fed to untrained mice showed improved learning. It was not a memory that was transferred but hormone enriched tissue.  Current usage and research  In epigenetics there are various mechanisms for cells to pass on \\"memories\\" of stressors to their progeny. Strategies include Msn2 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, changes in chromatin, partitioning of anti-stress factors, and damaged macromolecules between mother and daughter cells. In adaptive immunity there is a functional CM that enables the immune system to learn to react to pathogens through mechanisms such as cytoxic memory mediation in bone marrow, innate immune memory in stromal cells, fungal mediation of innate and inherited immunological response, and T and B-cell immune training. In this regard CM is essential for vaccine and immunity research.

The forest is chiefly in western and southern Lycoming County, with small portions in Clinton, Potter, Tioga, and Union Counties. As of July 1, 2005 the state forest lands in eastern Lycoming County, which had been part of Tiadaghton State Forest, became part of the new Loyalsock State Forest. The main office for district #12 is in South Williamsport, in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in the United States. There are plans to move it to the Pine Creek valley, perhaps to the village of Waterville. Tiadaghton is the Iroquois name for Pine Creek, but its meaning is unknown. History As the timber was exhausted and the land burned, many companies simply abandoned their holdings. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber companies and for a change in the philosophy of forest management. In 1895 Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. In 1897 the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation which authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations\\" and the first Pennsylvania state forest lands were acquired the following year. On July 13, 1898, the state bought a tract of land in Cummings Township for $72.99 ($ in terms). This was the first purchase for what became Tiadaghton State Forest, which surrounds the park. The state forest grew to by 1908, and over in 1933. Most of the major purchases for it were made between 1900 and 1935. 2005 Realignment Prior to the July 1, 2005 realignment of Pennsylvania State Forest Districts, Tiadaghton State Forest included all state forest lands in Lycoming County and encompassed . After realignment, the state forest tracts in eastern Lycoming County became part of the new Loyalsock State Forest. The District #12 office will also move from South Williamsport to Waterville, at the confluence of Little Pine Creek and Pine Creek, where the largest part of the forest is now located. The southern tracts are along Bald Eagle Mountain, North White Deer Ridge, South White Deer Ridge, and the White Deer Hole Creek watershed. As of 2009, the Tiadaghton State Forest covered , chiefly in Lycoming County with small tracts in Clinton, Potter, Tioga, and Union Counties.

Location theory addresses questions of what economic activities are located where and why. Location theory or microeconomic theory generally assumes that agents act in their own self- interest. Firms thus choose locations that maximize their profits and individuals choose locations that maximize their utility. Origins While others should get some credit for earlier work (e.g., Richard Cantillon, Etienne Bonnot de Condillac, David Hume, Sir James D. Steuart, and David Ricardo), it was not until the publication of Johann Heinrich von Th√ºnen's first volume of Der Isolierte Staat in 1826 that location theory can be said to have really gotten underway.Th√ºnen, Johann Heinrich von. 1783‚Äì1850. Der Isolierte Staat in Beziehung auf Landwirtschaft und National√∂konomie, oder Untersuchungen √ºber den Einfluss, den die Getreidepreise, der Reichtum des Bodens und die Abgaben auf den Ackerbau aus√ºben, Vol. 1,. and Der Isolierte Staat..., Vol II: Der Naturge√§sse Arbeitslohn und dessen Verh√§ltnis zum Zinsfuss und zur Landrente, Part 1 (Partial translation into English by Carla M. Wartenberg in 1966 as Isolated State. New York: Pergamon Press.) For more information, see Scott Crosier's Johann-Heinrich von Th√ºnen: Balancing Land- Use Allocation with Transport Cost .Dempsey, Bernard W. 1960. The Frontier Wage Chicago: Loyola University Press. In pages 187‚Äì367 Dempsey has translated von Th√ºnen 1863 piece Der Isolierte Staat, Vol II, Part 2 as The Isolated State in Relation to Agriculture and Political Economy, Vol. II: The Natural Wage and Its Relation to the Rate of Interest and to Economic Rent. Indeed, the prominent regional scientist Walter Isard has called von Th√ºnen \\"the father of location theorists.\\"Isard (1956, p. 27). In Der Isolierte Staat, von Th√ºnen notes that the costs of transporting goods consumes some of Ricardo's economic rent. He notes that because these transportation costs and, of course, economic rents, vary across goods, different land uses and use intensities will result with increased distance from the marketplace. However, the discussion was criticized since Johann Heinrich von Th√ºnen oversimplified the problem with his assumptions of, for example, isolated states or single cities.Richards, H. A. (1962). Transportation Costs and Plant Location: A Review of Principal Theories. Transportation Journal, 2(2), 19‚Äì24. Tord Palander (1935) wrote: Market area division of two competing firms.Google Books A German hegemony of sorts seems to have taken hold in location theory from the time of von Th√ºnen through to Walter Christaller's 1933 book Die Zentralen Orte in S≈±ddeutschland, which formulated much of what is now understood as central place theory. An especially notable contribution was made by Alfred Weber, who published √úber den Standort der Industrien in 1909.Weber, Alfred. 1929. (translated by Carl J. Friedrich from Weber's 1909 book). Theory of the Location of Industries. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. For more details see David Fearon's Alfred Weber: Theory of the Location of Industries, 1909 . Working from a model akin to a physical frame adapted from some ideas by Pierre Varignon (a Varignon frame), Weber applies freight rates of resources and finished goods, along with the finished good's production function, to develop an algorithm that identifies the optimal location for manufacturing plant. He also introduces distortions induced by labor and both agglomerative and deglomerative forces. Weber then discusses groupings of production units, anticipating August L√∂sch's market areas. Carl Wilhelm Friedrich Launhardt conceived much of that for which Alfred Weber received credit, prior to Weber's work. Moreover, his contributions are surprisingly more modern in their analytical content than are Weber's. This suggests that Launhardt was ahead of his time and not readily understood by many of his contemporaries. Whether Weber was familiar with Launhardt's publications remains unclear. Weber was most certainly influenced by others, most notably Wilhelm Roscher and Albert Sch√§ffle, who seem likely to have read Launhardt's work. Regardless, location theoretical thought blossomed only after Weber's book was published. Literature on site selection theory used to look until recent years at the various issues only from a national point of view. By large, there are no international reviews to be found in these publications. In the US, a country in which industrial site selection played a role very early on, resulting in a very early search for methodical approaches, Edgar M. Hoover was one of the leading pioneers in the field of site analysis. In his book ‚ÄúThe Location of Economic Activity‚Äù, Hoover compiled crucial criteria of industrial site selection as early as 1948 that still apply today. There were, however, some quite early attempts to combine theories of international trade with nationally oriented site theories in order to develop a site theory with an international perspective. One of these early authors was Ohlin (1952), followed by Sabathil (1969) , Moore (1978), Tesch (1980), and Goette (1994) . Nevertheless, even to this day, this situation has only changed to some extent. Even though since the 1990s it has no longer been only major corporations that expand abroad, and any foreign direct investment results in a site selection, there are still very few well- researched studies on this topic. A specifically international site selection theory is still not discernible. Many current and more recent publications either review site decisions made by individual corporations or analyze them as reference cases. Other publications focus on a cost-specific approach largely driven by site relocations in the context of cost structure optimization within major corporations. However, these publications only rarely and at best cursorily deal with issues of construction and real estate aspects. Theodor Sabathil‚Äôs 1969 dissertation is considered one of the early in-depth studies in the area of international site selection. Therein, Sabathil largely focused on country selection, which is part of the site selection process. In this context, Sabathil compiled a comprehensive catalogue of site factors and a theoretical approach to site selection; the latter does not go into great detail. Neither does Sabathil take any legal, natural, or cultural site factors into consideration. However, he discusses in particular company-specific framework conditions and psychological factors. Glatte, Thomas 2015. Location Strategies: Methods and their methodological limitations Journal for Engineering, Design and Technology, Volume 13, Issue 3, p. 435 - 462 The dissertation submitted in 1980 by Peter Tesch constitutes another milestone in the further development of international site theory. Tesch combines theories of international trade and investment with site theories. He is the first to include country-specific framework conditions in his analysis. The main basis for his comments on the various types of internationalization are location-specific competitive advantages. In this context, Tesch developed a catalogue of criteria for international site decisions grouped into three categories: ‚Ä¢ site factors affecting all company activities ‚Ä¢ availability and costs of the site factors impacting on the production factors ‚Ä¢ turnover-related site factors. Thomas Goette‚Äôs 1994 study tries to classify important international site factors and to structure the process of international site selection. Goette distinguishes between economic site conditions (sales potential, competitive conditions, infrastructure and transportation costs, labor, monetary conditions), political site conditions (tax legislation, environmental protection, institutional market entry barriers, support of business, political risks), cultural site conditions (differences in language, mentality, religion, and the lack of acceptancy of foreign companies), and geographical site conditions (climate, topography). This study again demonstrates that an attempt to cover all aspects will result in loss of quality as all factors were not or could not be taken into consideration. Goette also theorizes that, in particular, industrial site decisions within companies are usually once-off and division-related decision- making processes. Based on this, Goette assumes a relatively low learning curve, and hence little potential for improvement for subsequent projects. As one of the last major contributions, Thomas Glatte aimed to enhance and globalize the known systems in his book \\"International Production Site Selection\\" by providing a 10-staged selection process, suggesting selected methods for each selection stage and offering a comprehensive list of criteria for the practitioner.Glatte, Thomas 2013. Industrial Production Site Selection Expert Verlag, Renningen, Germany Other uses Location theory has also been used outside of economics, for example in conservation biology, where it can help to find areas that would be good to study, taking into account previous studies.

Reassigned species Seven species have been referred to this genus over the years, six of which have since been reassigned to other genera: *Palaeoscincus africanus, named by Robert Broom in 1910/1912, a partial jaw from the Tithonian-Valanginian-age Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Kirkwood Formation of South Africa, now known as the stegosaurid Paranthodon; *Palaeoscincus asper, \\"the rough one\\", a dubious tooth taxon from the late Campanian-age Upper Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, Canada, named by Lawrence Morris Lambe in 1902, based on a single tooth, specimen NMC 1349 now referred to Euoplocephalus;Coombs Jr., W.P. (1990). Teeth and taxonomy in ankylosaurs. In: Carpenter, K., and Currie, P.J. (eds.). Dinosaur Systematics: Approaches and Perspectives. Cambridge University Press:Cambridge, 269-279. *Palaeoscincus costatus, \\"the ribbed one\\", the type species named by Leidy in 1856, known from a single tooth, specimen ANSP 9263 found by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden near Fort Benton. It was the first ankylosaurian species to be named based on American material; it is now considered an ankylosaurian of unknown affinities. *Palaeoscincus latus, \\"the wide one\\" named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1892, from the late Maastrichtian-age Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation of Wyoming, also based on a single tooth, specimen YPM 4810 found in Niobrara County, Wyoming, now believed to have come from a pachycephalosaurid; *\\"P. magoder\\", a nomen nudum name from a faunal list by Karl (\\"Charles\\") L. Henning, the result of mistaking the German words mag oder for a specific name; *Palaeoscincus rugosidens, \\"rough tooth\\" named by Charles Whitney Gilmore in 1930, the best- known species, a skull and partial skeleton from the late Campanian-age Two Medicine Formation of Montana, now known as Edmontonia rugosidens, or a separate genus Chassternbergia. It was this species that was portrayed in most restorations of the genus. *Palaeoscincus tutus, a renaming of Euoplocephalus tutus by Edwin Hennig in 1915.Hennig, E., 1915, Stegosauria: Fossilium Catalogus I, Animalia pars 9, 16 pp Today, the type species P. costatus and thereby the genus is considered to be an indeterminate ankylosaurian,Carpenter, K.

The main offices are located in Renovo, Pennsylvania in Clinton County in the United States. The forest is located in western Clinton County and northern Centre County and contains of land. It also includes several tracts in Potter, Cameron County, and Lycoming Counties. Its forests are part of the Allegheny Highlands forests ecoregion. It was named for former Pennsylvania governor William C. Sproul (in office from 1919 to 1923). The first land for what became Sproul State Forest was purchased in 1898. This was also the first land purchased by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for what are now the twenty Pennsylvania State Forests, with over two million acres (810,000 ha) of forest. History The Sproul State Forest was named in memory of William C. Sproul, Governor of Pennsylvania from 1919 to 1923.http://www.stateparks.com/sproul.html Sproul State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system. Trails Hiking -- Two hiking trails systems designated as State Forest Trails are located within the Sproul State Forest. The Chuck Keiper Trail is a double looped system which includes trails in the Fish Dam Wild Area and Burns Run Wild Area. The Chuck Keiper Trail is marked with orange paint blazes. The Donut Hole Trail is approximately in length and connects with the Susquehannock Trail System. The trail traverses Kettle Creek Park and terminates at Hyner Run State Park. The Donut Hole Trail is marked with orange paint blazes. The Eagleton Mine Camp Trail, EMCT, is around a 20-mile loop that has an inter connector. The trail is marked in red. The map is found here http://www.clintoncountyinfo.com/eagletontrail.pdf There are numerous other foot trails which were originally built for fire access which provide good hiking into most parts of the Sproul State Forest. These trails are not marked or maintained. When hiking in the Sproul State forest persons should dress for the weather and use map and compass Equestrian Use -- An Equestrian Trail located near Kettle Creek State Park is a loop. The Eagleton Mine Camp Trail, a multi-use trail, offers a loop through several historical locations in the area. Additionally with the exception of designated hiking trails and municipal watersheds, horseback riders may utilized the old woods roads and State Forest Road system. Trail maps are available by contacting the Sproul district office. Mountain Biking -- All trails within the Sproul State Forest are open to mountain biking, with the exception of the Donut Hole Trail and the Chuck Keiper Trail. Most trails are kept clear over the summer, but some do become overgrown. It is recommended you contact the district office to find out which trails are better for riding. The Eagleton Mine Camp Trail offers excellent biking. Many sections are narrow, steep and rocky. The northern section is not as technical as the southern loop. Cross-country Skiing -- Hiking Bear Ski Trail is located on Hyner Mountain and traverses . The trail covers diverse terrain providing opportunities for both novice and experienced skiers. Bloody Skillet ATV area Snowmobiling -- Snowmobile Trails are available for use when snow conditions permit. The Hyner Mountain Trail system is marked and groomed. Also, many State Forest Roads are open for joint use of snowmobiles and licensed motorized vehicles. All Terrain Vehicles -- There is one area in the Sproul State Forest open to All Terrain Vehicles use. The area is located near the Huling Branch of Two Mile Run and consists of old woods roads, old coal mining roads, and unreclaimed surface mining areas. All the rest of Sproul State Forest is closed to All Terrain Vehicle use. Fishing and Hunting Fishing - There are over of freestone cold water streams within the Sproul State Forest. Included in this total are 12 streams where water quality and native trout populations are such that these streams are classified as Wilderness Trout Streams. Hunting - Black bear, whitetail dear, and wild turkey habitat is abundant, and these species are found in good numbers throughout the Sproul State forest. Other Recreation Hang Gliding - Hyner View State Park offers seasonal hang gliding opportunities for recreation. Hang gliders take off from the vista and sail out over the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. Prowl the Sproul - The Western Clinton's Sportsmen's Association hosts this yearly event, which draws many people of different skill levels. Participation in the events requires registration, and includes kayaking, hiking, a 10k run, biking, or guided hikes. Nature Observation - Because the Sproul State Forest is removed from densely populated areas, it is teeming with wildlife of all kinds. Bobcats, Black Bear, Coyotes, and White-Tailed Deer can be seen, and many varied species of migratory birds can be seen nesting here in the spring. The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation of Natural Resources considers parts of the Sproul State Forest \\"Important Bird Areas\\" for these migratory species. In addition to the wildlife, natural succession of forest growth is very clearly visible along PA Route 144 where a recent forest fire swept through some of the plateaus, and waterfalls are a common sight in many of the streams running through the forest.

She is portrayed by actress Cynthia Nixon. Nixon received an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. Character analysis Miranda Hobbes is a feisty career- minded red-headed lawyer with extremely cynical views on relationships and men. A 1990 Harvard Law School J.D. from the Philadelphia area, she is Carrie Bradshaw's confidante and voice of reason. In the early seasons she is portrayed as distrustful and resentful of men, but this image softens over the years, particularly after she becomes pregnant by her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Steve Brady, whom she eventually marries. The birth of her son, Brady Hobbes, brings up new issues for her Type A, workaholic personality, but she eventually finds a way to balance career, being single, and motherhood. Of the four women, she is the first to purchase an apartment (an indicator of her success), which she gives up when she moves into a Brooklyn townhouse in the final season to make room for her growing family. Sex and the City: The Movie  In the movie, Miranda is still married to Steve, and they are living in Brooklyn with their son Brady, who is now five years old. We learn that she is still employing Magda and that Steve's mother Mary is living in a nursing home, as she now suffers from advancing Alzheimer's. Miranda and Steve's relationship has become stale, with Miranda under pressure of her job and caring for Brady. After a shared laugh one night over Miranda having a milk moustache, the two have sex in a moment of newfound passion, but midway through Miranda tells Steve to hurry up because she has to get up early, which upsets him. At one of their coffee dates, Miranda tells the girls that she and Steve have not had sex in six months, and shortly afterwards Steve confesses he had sex with another woman one time out of frustration. Although Steve begs for forgiveness, Miranda insists on splitting up, and she moves to the Lower East Side. In a moment of shortsighted selfishness, she tells Big the night before his and Carrie's wedding that they are crazy to get married because it ruins everything, causing him to leave Carrie at the altar. Miranda wants to confess everything right after, but Charlotte convinces her it was not really her fault but Big's. The girls change the honeymoon trip into a vacation trip for themselves. Almost a (lonely) year passes by before Miranda confesses it on Valentine's Day to Carrie about her wrongdoing. Carrie berates Miranda for wanting forgiveness for her own mistake but refusing to forgive Steve. Miranda and Steve go to couples' therapy, during which they decide to meet on the Brooklyn Bridge in two weeks if they want to forgive and forget what happened and start over. Miranda starts contemplating her relationship with Steve by making a pro and cons list. She looks in the mirror and sees that she has a milk moustache. This makes her realize she wants to be with Steve after all and she hurries to the Brooklyn Bridge to reconcile with him. Sex and the City 2  In Sex and the City 2, Miranda is an overworked lawyer who barely has enough time to show up to her son's school activities. She feels that she's being taken advantage of at work, overlooked because she is a woman. When Steve suggests she quit her job, she is reluctant but does after she is overlooked‚Äîthen shushed‚Äîby her boss during a meeting. Although she has every intention of returning to work, Miranda revels in her free time and happily makes it to Brady's activities. As part of her break, she decides to accompany Samantha, Carrie and Charlotte to Abu Dhabi. While there, Miranda takes charge of the group's scheduling and learns an impressive amount of Arabic. She also sympathizes with Charlotte at her feeling inadequate, confessing that it's exhausting being a \\"good\\" mother. When she arrives home, after they're kicked out of the hotel, she looks for and finds a more self-fulfilling job. She is last seen at an outdoor staff meeting (having found a new position at another, more relaxed law firm) where she is obviously flourishing and appreciated. The Carrie Diaries The Carrie Diaries's showrunner Amy B. Harris revealed that if the show had been renewed for a third season, Miranda would have been introduced as Mouse's roommate at Harvard. This did not happen, as in May 2014, The CW canceled the series after two seasons. Relationships Skipper Johnston Skipper Johnston (Ben Weber) is a 27-year-old website developer with whom Miranda enters into a tentative relationship in the first season. Originally introduced by Carrie, Miranda finds Skipper young and immature, and is irritated by his romantic view of life and love, which contrasts sharply with her cynical outlook. Although they occasionally engage in an on-again, off-again sexual relationship, she never plans for him to become a serious interest. In contrast, Skipper is terribly smitten with Miranda from the start, even going so far as to break up with a girl in mid- intercourse when Miranda calls, as he believes it means that \\"the woman he loves most\\" wants to be with him. Horrified at learning this, Miranda suggests dating other people but Skipper, angered by Miranda's attitude, breaks it off and leaves. He is next seen when his latest girlfriend ends things with him and as this has happened a lot, Skipper is angry - attracting Miranda's attention again. Dr. Robert Leeds Dr. Robert Leeds (Blair Underwood) is a successful sports medicine doctor for the New York Knicks, whom Miranda meets while interviewing him with fellow members of her building's tenant board to occupy a vacant apartment. Upon Robert's arrival, Miranda is instantly charmed by him, and somewhat hijacks the interview in order to learn more about him. Robert is eventually approved to move in, and in time the two begin a short but lively romantic relationship. Despite Miranda and Robert's sparks of chemistry, Miranda cannot control her longing for her current on- again, off-again boyfriend, Steve Brady. Eventually, at her son's first birthday party, Miranda professes her love to Steve, and her relationship with Robert is ended off-screen. After a few awkward encounters, Robert overcomes his anger towards Miranda and Steve, and is last seen in the series with two scantily dressed women in his apartment. Steve Brady Steve Brady (David Eigenberg) and Miranda meet during the second season when Miranda is waiting for Carrie at the bar where Steve works. Although Miranda simply sees Steve as a one-night stand after they meet, Steve senses a strong connection, and he asks to see her again. Miranda refuses at first, but they become a couple after she realizes her strong attraction for Steve. The couple's difference in economic status creates tension in their relationship, and they eventually break up. However, they remain on friendly terms, often leading to a sexual relationship between the two. After Steve loses one of his testicles to cancer, Miranda sleeps with him to convince him that having one ball will not prevent women from having sex with him. This union results in her pregnancy. She initially decides to have an abortion without planning to inform Steve of her pregnancy. At the clinic, she changes her mind, and decides to keep the baby. Miranda tells Steve she is pregnant and will take on full responsibility, including raising the child and providing all the related finances, but Steve can visit whenever he wants and generally be a part of the baby's life. Steve later proposes to Miranda, which prompts her to yell at him that she doesn't want to marry him, to which Steve responds that he doesn't really want to marry her. Miranda gives birth to Brady Hobbes (an homage to their respective surnames), and the two try to raise him together as platonic partners, with difficulty. Miranda initially pretends that she doesn't love Steve, but when she attempts to admit her feelings for him, she discovers he is now seeing another woman, Debbie. Eventually, at Brady's first birthday party, Miranda ends up blurting out her love for Steve and, to her delight and surprise, Steve admits that he, too, loves Miranda, and that she is \\"the one.\\" They kiss, and within three weeks they are back together; they remain together for the rest of the series, eventually getting married in a simple ceremony with their closest friends and family in a community garden and purchasing a townhouse in Brooklyn for their growing family. In Sex and the City: The Movie, the pair go through a rough part whereby Steve cheats on Miranda. The couple split and then go through counselling and reunite at the end of the film.

Originally voiced by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara, Belle is the non-conforming daughter of an inventor, who yearns to abandon her predictable village life in return for adventure. When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast, Belle offers him her own freedom in exchange for her father's, and eventually learns to love the Beast despite his unsightly outward appearance. Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg commissioned Beauty and the Beast as an animated musical with a strong heroine and hired first-time screenwriter Linda Woolverton to write it. Basing her on the heroine of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont's 1756 fairy tale \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", Woolverton adapted Belle into a stronger and less passive character for the film. Inspired by the women's rights movement, Woolverton wanted Belle to be a unique Disney heroine different from The Little Mermaid's popular Ariel, and thus deliberately conceived the character as a feminist in an effort to avoid the criticism Disney had long been receiving due to the studio's reputation of depicting its female characters as victims. Belle's strength and love of reading was inspired by American actress Katharine Hepburn's performance as Jo March in the film Little Women (1933), while the writers instilled the adventure- seeking heroine with goals and aspirations beyond romance. However, the story artists and animators often contested Woolverton's liberated vision for the character. Animated by James Baxter and Mark Henn, the former of whom based the character's graceful gait on those of impressionist Edgar Degas' ballerinas, Belle's European facial features were inspired by those of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn. Several additional Hollywood actresses inspired Belle's appearance, including Natalie Wood, Elizabeth Taylor, and Grace Kelly. Belle has garnered widespread acclaim from film critics who appreciated the character's bravery, intelligence and independence. Reception towards her feminism, however, has been more mixed, with commentators accusing the character's actions of being romance-oriented. The fifth Disney Princess, Belle is often ranked among the franchise's best. Highly regarded as one of Disney's strongest examples of a feminist character, critics agree that Belle helped spearhead a generation of independent film heroines while changing the reputation of a Disney princess. Also one of Disney's most iconic characters, Belle was the only animated heroine nominated for the American Film Institute's greatest heroes in film ranking. The character also appears in the film's several sequels and spin-offs, as well as her own live-action television series. American actress Susan Egan originated the role of Belle in the Broadway musical adaptation of the film, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Emma Watson played a live-action version of the character in the 2017 live action adaptation of the original 1991 film. Development Conception and writing After the success of Walt Disney Productions' first feature-length animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), filmmaker Walt Disney himself made several attempts to adapt the fairy tale \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont into one of the studio's earliest animated feature films during the 1930s and 1950s. However, the project was continuously abandoned due to the fairy tale's \\"static\\" plot and main characters. The filmmaker was also concerned about the \\"unnecessary intensity\\" required to depict Belle's imprisonment. Inspired by the unprecedented success of The Little Mermaid (1989), Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg green-lit another attempt at adapting \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" under the direction of Richard Purdum. However, Katzenberg did not approve of Purdum's dark, somber version of the fairy tale, and ultimately ordered that it be restarted from scratch in favor of creating a Broadway-style musical film starring a strong heroine, more similar to The Little Mermaid. Opting instead for a \\"feminist twist\\" on the original story, largely in response to critics' negative reception to Ariel regarding her pursuit of Eric being her overall character, Katzenberg hired television writer Linda Woolverton, who had never written an animated film before, to write the film's screenplay. American actress Katharine Hepburn's performance as Jo March in the film Little Women (1933) served as screenwriter Linda Woolverton's inspiration for Belle's personality. Before Beauty and the Beast, Disney's tradition of depicting female characters as victims had already long been established. The fact that Belle was hardly depicted as a feminist in earlier versions of the film became a point of contention among the filmmakers. Despite the fact that Disney wanted Beauty and the Beast to resemble an old-fashioned film, the filmmakers envisioned Belle as \\"a woman that was ahead of her time\\". As the first woman in the history of Disney to write a feature-length animated film, Woolverton decided to explore Belle as an opportunity to create a female character who would ultimately be better received than Disney's previous animated heroines, specifically Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Woolverton was aware that the task would be particularly challenging due to the previous character's popularity, but fought relentlessly to make sure that she was creating \\"a new kind of Disney heroine.\\" Inspired by the women's rights movement Woolverton herself had experienced during the 1960s and 1970s, the screenwriter was determined to avoid creating another \\"insipid\\" Disney princess and decided to conceive Belle as a headstrong feminist. Woolverton strongly believed that contemporary audiences would not identify with Belle unless she was updated appropriately, and thus evolved the character into \\"a woman of the '90s\\". The screenwriter refused to watch Jean Cocteau's 1946 film adaptation of the fairy tale and chose to base Belle on American actress Katharine Hepburn's portrayal of Jo March in the 1933 film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's book Little Women instead, who she felt was \\"a real depiction of womanhood.\\" Similarly, story artist Brenda Chapman drew influence from Hepburn's on-screen bickering with actor Spencer Tracy during the scene in which Belle tends to the Beast's wounds. Animator Mark Henn observed that, unlike Ariel, Belle does not \\"fall in love at first sight\\"; instead \\"there's an actual relationship you see grow\\". In the original fairy tale, Belle has two selfish sisters who both have their own respective love interests, all of whom Woolverton omitted from the screenplay in favor of focusing solely on Belle's relationship with Gaston. At one point, Belle had a younger sister named Clarice and a cruel aunt named Marguerite, both of whom were discarded ‚Äì Clarice to emphasize Belle's loneliness, and Marguerite to be replaced by Gaston as the film's villain. Woolverton also eliminated the subplot of Belle asking her father for a rose. Despite constant \\"regressive\\" re-writes, Woolverton's overall vision for Belle generally remained intact. Beauty and the Beast's story department was predominantly male, a time during which few women were involved. Woolverton often found herself at odds and disagreeing with the more traditional story artists in regards to Belle's role in the film, but continued to be supported by Katzenberg and lyricist Howard Ashman. According to Woolverton, the story team challenged nearly every line of dialogue Woolverton suggested for the character. On one occasion, the story artists re-wrote what Woolverton had originally scripted as Belle using a map to indicate places to where she would like to travel to the character baking a cake. Arguing that the liberated Belle would not even know how to bake, Woolverton decided to compromise by having the character read a book instead, which was similarly debated because some filmmakers considered reading to be too passive an activity. To resolve this, Woolverton scripted Belle walk while reading, an activity in which Woolverton herself partook as a child. In Beaumont's fairy tale, Belle is essentially forced to replace her father as the Beast's prisoner. To make the character more independent, Woolverton re-wrote her so that she willingly ventures into the woods in search of her father, bravely confronts the Beast and ultimately trades her own freedom in return for Maurice's instead. During Gaston's climactic fight with the Beast, the character's line \\"Time to die!\\" was changed to \\"Belle is mine!\\" in order to return the focus of the story to Belle. Voice Disney had originally considered casting actress Jodi Benson, who famously voiced Ariel in The Little Mermaid, as Belle, but ultimately felt that she sounded \\"too American\\" and young, opting for a \\"more classical ... womanly\\" voice instead. Describing the character as \\"a woman that was ahead of her time,\\" the filmmakers wanted Belle to sound \\"more like a woman than a girl.\\" However, Benson voiced Belle in a few episodes of Disney's House of Mouse. Director Kirk Wise was particularly interested in casting an actress capable of \\"creat[ing] a character completely with her voice\\", envisioning a voice similar to that of American entertainer Judy Garland. American actress and singer Paige O'Hara was performing on Broadway when she first read about Disney's then-upcoming animated project Beauty and the Beast in an article in The New York Times. Upon discovering that the studio was holding auditions for the lead role of Belle and, at the behest of lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken, specifically recruiting Broadway performers, O'Hara immediately insisted that her agent get her an audition. Familiar with O'Hara's Broadway stint as Ellie May Chipley in the musical Show Boat; Ashman had already been eyeing O'Hara for the part. O'Hara auditioned for the role five times, competing against approximately 500 other actresses. First auditioning solely for casting director Albert Taveres, O'Hara's next two auditions simply required the actress to mail audio recordings of her voice to the studio in Los Angeles. Required to perform a song of her choice, O'Hara sang \\"Heaven Help My Heart\\" from the musical Chess. At her first legitimate audition, O'Hara spoke and sang in a higher register than her own in an effort to mimic Snow White from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but the filmmakers insisted that she use her own voice instead. In addition to Ashman and Menken, O'Hara's last few auditions were attended by directors Wise and Gary Trousdale, and producers Katzenberg and Don Hahn. O'Hara recalled that the songwriters would first close their eyes and listen to her before finally watching her perform. An hour after her fifth and final audition, O'Hara received a telephone call from Disney on her birthday informing her that she had been cast. The actress was fairly confident that the role was hers before she was officially cast, and credits the fact that Ashman enjoyed her performance on the cast recording of the musical Show Boat. O'Hara admitted, \\"I'm not usually confident about auditions ... but I just understood (Belle) so much.\\" Thirty years old at the time of her audition, O'Hara consequently imbued Belle's voice with a mature, \\"womanly quality\\" despite the character's young age. Woolverton appreciated the fact that O'Hara sounded more mature than traditional Disney heroines. Additionally, O'Hara identified with her character because they were both ostracized by their peers throughout their childhood because of their unconventional interests, explaining, \\"I was odd growing up myself. I mean, I was into musical theater and Gershwin and Rodgers and Hammerstein while people were going to Led Zeppelin concerts. So I understood that ... I wasn't the norm either. I was very focused on my career, on my performing all through my childhood and my teens ... I had a one-track mind, and I think that Belle was like that a lot.\\" O'Hara also shares Belle's interest in reading. Wise was pleased with the quality of O'Hara's voice, which reminded him of Garland. O'Hara initially found it challenging to control her speaking volume due to having been trained to project as a stage actress. O'Hara told The Guardian that to solve this she \\"softened and used the microphone.\\" As per the filmmakers' encouragement, the actress would occasionally ad-lib her own dialogue, none was included in the final film because it sounded \\"too modern\\". The animators would videotape O'Hara daily while she recorded to incorporate her \\"quirky\\" mannerisms, expressions and gestures into the character, among them her hair constantly falling into her eyes. O'Hara and American actor Robby Benson, who provides the voice of the Beast, asked Disney to allow the co-stars to record together as opposed to the traditional method of being isolated in a recording booth, to which the studio agreed despite its costliness. O'Hara credited the filmmaker's decision with developing both the film and Belle and the Beast's relationship. O'Hara and Benson became the first Disney voice actors to record together. In total, the recording process took over two years to complete. O'Hara had already been friends with co-star Richard White, who voices Gaston, for 15 years. Despite her successful stage career, O'Hara was virtually unknown to Hollywood audiences when she was cast in Beauty and the Beast; she was one of the last obscure actresses to be cast in a feature-length Disney animated film before the studio began casting better known talent in subsequent animated projects. Since the November 1991 release of Beauty and the Beast, O'Hara has returned to The Walt Disney Company on several occasions to voice Belle in a variety of media and merchandise, including its direct-to-video sequels Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas (1997), Belle's Magical World (1998) and Belle's Tales of Friendship (1999), as well as various video game releases such as the Kingdom Hearts series and several audio and video recordings associated with the Disney Princess franchise. Additionally, O'Hara was hired by Disney to perform the song \\"Belle\\" at the 64th Academy Awards in 1992. O'Hara has referred to the studio as her \\"main employer for 20 years\\". In 2011, O'Hara was officially replaced by actress Julie Nathanson, who first voiced Belle in the video game Kinect Disneyland Adventures (2011). O'Hara revealed to the Las Vegas Review-Journal that news of the replacement greatly upset her to the point of which she was willing to re-record much of Belle's dialogue in an attempt to prove to the company that she is still capable of voicing the character. However, O'Hara eventually admitted that she found the process quite difficult as a result of the way in which her voice has changed over the course of 20 years. O'Hara would eventually return as the voice of Belle in the 2018 film Ralph Breaks the Internet. Personality According to producer Don Hahn, Beaumont's Belle is an \\"incredibly passive\\" character, the personality of whom he likened to those of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, as well as American actress and animal rights activist Doris Day, describing them as women who are \\"capable, but filling a role that women might fill in the 1950s and 1960s.‚Äù The filmmakers painstakingly reworked Belle into a more three-dimensional character by providing her with goals and aspirations beyond romance and marriage, while expanding her passive role into that of a more inquisitive heroine. Determined to have Belle resemble \\"an unusual Disney heroine,\\" Woolverton deliberately molded her into an independent character who is not a princess, enjoys books and has little interest in marriage, and worked closely with Ashman to create a proactive heroine \\"who was a thinker and a reader and she wasn‚Äôt about what she looked like and she wasn‚Äôt a victim.\\" Although Belle being well-read is mentioned in the original fairy tale, it is hardly important to its plot. Thus, Belle's passion for reading was vastly expanded upon, borrowing from both the Little Woman character Jo March and Woolverton's own love of reading to further demonstrate the character's intelligence and open mind. Both Woolverton and O'Hara encouraged the filmmakers to emphasize the intelligent and book-loving aspects of Belle's personality. However, at times the animators struggled to fulfill Woolverton's vision. Originally, Belle was depicted constantly crying throughout her imprisonment; Woolverton resented this, arguing that the character was much more likely to be either searching for an escape or simply \\"be intrigued that she was living in an enchanted castle\\" than crying. \\"Once everybody realized she wasn‚Äôt going to be this typical Disney female, they would go to the extreme ... She became bitchy\\"; the screenwriter argued that Belle would be \\"too smart\\" to act this way. A few years older than The Little Mermaid's Ariel, Belles' love of reading makes the character more worldly and mature than her predecessor. Belle is believed by Henn to be \\"probably\\" the oldest of Disney's princesses, at 20 years of age. Design and animation Beauty and the Beast became the first animated film to fully credit each animator responsible for animating a specific character during the film's closing credits. Belle's supervising animators were James Baxter and Mark Henn. Belle was Henn's second Disney heroine, after he had previously contributed to animating Ariel. Henn was specifically assigned certain scenes to animate from the studio's Florida division. Having since animated Jasmine in Aladdin (1992), the title character in Mulan (1998) and Tiana in The Princess and the Frog (2009), Henn has established himself \\"as the go-to man behind many Disney princesses.\\" To demonstrate that the character is not perfect, Woolverton described \\"a little wisp of hair that keeps falling in her face,\\" which was the only direction she used to describe Belle's physical appearance. Wanting Belle to be significantly different and more European in appearance than Ariel, the animators drew her with fuller lips, narrower eyes and darker eyebrows, which were inspired by the facial features of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn. More statuesque than most Disney princesses, Belle's appearance was inspired by that of American actress Jennie Garth. The animators also used photographs of Hollywood actresses Natalie Wood, Elizabeth Taylor and Grace Kelly for reference. Baxter studied the art of French impressionist Edgar Degas, a painter known for his portraits of ballerinas, whose work inspired the animator to incorporate \\"graceful, swan-like movements\\" into Belle's performance. Belle's yellow ballgown was inspired by a similar costume Hepburn wore in the film Roman Holiday (1953). Hahn and a team of male filmmakers designed the ballgown while consuming pizza and alcohol. Originally, the marketing department ordered that Belles' dress be pink to cater to the female audience, but art director Brian McEntee convinced studio to make the dress gold in order to make her to distinguish her from other Disney Princess, specifically Aurora's from Sleeping Beauty (1959). Art director Brian McEntee suggested that Belle be the only character in her village to wear blue in order emphasize the fact that she is different and an outcast. The colors Belle wears also mimic her emotions, blue being associated with sadness and loneliness. Blue was also used to symbolize good, while Gaston's red represented evil. According to the Directory of World Cinema: American Hollywood by Lincoln Geraghty, Belle was inspired by actress Judy Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Julie Andrews' performance as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965). Actress and model Sherri Stoner served as the performance model for Belle, providing live-action reference for the animators as they drew the character. Belle's tendency to constantly brush her hair away from her face was also inspired by both Stoner and O'Hara. \\"I was constantly doing that and little quirky things that they would catch,\\" O'Hara told The Guardian. The animators also incorporated O'Hara's eyes, cheekbones and the way in which she raises her eyebrow into Belle's face. O'Hara felt that Belle originally looked \\"too perfect,\\" likening the character's appearance to actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon observed inconsistencies in Belle's appearance, writing, \\"The prettiest and liveliest Belle waltzes with Beast in his marble ballroom and weeps over his body before he's transformed into the Prince\\" while \\"The Belle who receives the library from Beast has wider-set eyes and a more prominent mouth than the noticeably slimmer Belle who sings 'Something There'\\". Characterization and themes Woolverton created Belle as part of \\"her self-directed mandate to move women and girls forward.\\" The Express-Times described the character as an intelligent young woman who \\"sings songs about reading and wanting to gain knowledge, rather than falling in love.\\" Woolverton credits Belle's knowledge and love of books with providing the character with a \\"point of view of her life and that doesn't necessarily involve a man getting her there.\\" One of the film's main themes, Belle is considered an outsider because her love of reading provides her with knowledge of the outside world as opposed to her \\"narrow-minded\\" village peers. Writing for Wired.com, Matt Blum dubbed Belle \\"the geekiest heroine of any Disney animated film\\", exemplified by an opening number that demonstrates just how much she does not fit in with her peers due to her intelligence and active imagination. Similarly, Boxoffice's Amy Nicholson coined the character \\"Disney's Smartest Heroine,\\" while Rob Burch of The Hollywood News observed that the character \\"comes across as arrogant at times\\" because she \\"spends much of the first act complaining.\\" In her book Sex, Love and Abuse: Discourses on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, author Sharon Hayes described Belle as \\"the quintessential beautiful young ingenue.\\" Comparing Belle's personality to that of the princess in the Brothers Grimm's fairy tale \\"The Frog Prince\\", The Meanings of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\": A Handbook author Jerry Griswold described the character as a similarly \\"feisty and outspoken\\" heroine. Writing for St. Francis Xavier University, Dawn Elizabeth England observed that Belle possesses equally as many traditionally feminine as she does masculine traits, citing her bravery, independence and assertiveness as masculine, and her sensitivity and fearfulness as feminine. According to Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in the Reagan Era author Susan Jeffords, \\"Belle's credentials as heroine are established ... when she is the only one of the town's single women not to swoon over Gaston,\\" while the character's love of reading is essentially manipulated \\"to mark her as better than the rest of the townspeople.\\" Writing for The Statesman, David O'Connor cited Belle's intelligence and bibliophilia as \\"in stark opposition to the insensitive and significantly dim-witted Gaston.\\" Critics continue to debate over whether Belle or the Beast is the film's protagonist. Susan Jeffords, author of Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in the Reagan Era, felt that although Belle appears to be the protagonist in Beaumont's original fairy tale, the character becomes \\"less the focus of the narrative\\" in Disney's adaptation and more of a \\"mechanism for solving the Beast's 'dilemma'.\\" In her article \\"The Tangled Evolution of the Disney Princess\\", Noelle Buffam felt that Belle arrived just in time when Disney's heroines were \\"in a dire need for some change,\\" awarding her \\"the red stamp of approval\\" for her intelligence and spirit. Analyzing ways in which Disney's heroines have evolved over time due to \\"the approach to the characterization of the princesses chang[ing]\\" as the characters gradually transformed from passive young women into heroines who \\"had ambitions and desires aside from finding true love,\\" critics often divide the Disney Princesses into three separate categories and rank Belle among the middle of the timeline, with Kit Steinkellner of HelloGiggles observing that the character improved upon \\"the Disney princess archetype\\" by simultaneously serving as both a \\"dreamer\\" and a \\"doer\\" in her film, as opposed to exclusively the former. Film historian Paula Sigman Lowery explained to the Daily Express that Belle's personality is a combination of Ariel's spirit and burgeoning independence, and Pocahontas' maturity, while Belle is \\"a little older [than Ariel] and a little further along in their journey towards independence.\\" About.com's David Nusair believes that Belle belongs to a category of Disney Princesses known as \\"The Lady Vanishes,\\" in which the heroines, in spite of being brave, outspoken and independent, nonetheless \\"are forced to behave passively as others help them achieve their respective goals.\\" Michelle Munro, writing for Durham College of Applied Arts and Technology, felt that even though Belle shares several traits with her more passive predecessors, the character introduced \\"new possibilities for princesses.\\" Girls in Capes wrote that Belle pioneered a generation of princesses who taught \\"about ambition, self-discovery and the pursuit of what we want.\\" Additionally, Belle remains Disney's first and only princess to have hazel eyes. Appearances Film and television Belle debuted in Beauty and the Beast (1991) as a beautiful bibliophile who, although praised by her fellow villagers for her unrivaled beauty, is at the same time ridiculed for her intelligence and non-conformity. Having grown weary of her uneventful provincial life, in which she is relentlessly romantically pursued by an arrogant hunter named Gaston, Belle longs for adventure. After her father's horse returns without its rider, she willingly ventures into the woods in search of her father. She persuades the Beast that she will trade her own freedom in return for her father's, since her father is ill in the dungeon, promising to remain with the Beast in his castle among his staff of enchanted objects forever. Belle's curiosity leads her to the forbidden west wing where she discovers an enchanted rose without realizing that it is tied to the Beast's fate; and the Beast's rage at her trespassing causes her to flee the castle on horseback. Belle is pursued by wolves in the woods but they are driven off by the Beast, afterwards Belle helps the injured Beast back to the castle and nurses him back to health. Although she initially dislikes her captor, Belle gradually learns to accept the Beast in spite of his appearance and eventually befriends him. Belle and the Beast's strong bond greatly envies Gaston to the point of which he storms the castle and mortally wounds the Beast, though Gaston falls to his own death in the process. However, Belle breaks down and confesses her love for the Beast just in time to break the spell under which he had been placed by an enchantress as punishment for his selfish ways, and the Beast ultimately transforms back into a handsome prince. In Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas (1997), Belle attempts to reignite the castle's waning spirit by reintroducing and celebrating Christmas, in spite of the Beast's strong resentment towards the holiday. Meanwhile, a solemn pipe organ named Forte grows determined to sabotage Belle and the Beast's burgeoning friendship because he longs to maintain his co-dependent relationship with his master. Tricked by Forte into retrieving a large Christmas tree from a frozen pond, Belle nearly drowns, only to be rescued by the Beast. The Beast, however, having been misinformed by Forte, wrongly accuses Belle of trying to escape again, and locks her in the dungeon as punishment. When the Beast finally discovers the truth, they forgive each other, and Belle helps him thwart Forte's plan to destroy the castle. Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World (1998), depicts Belle as she interacts with both the Beast and his enchanted servants in various segments, exploring themes such as forgiveness, friendship, cooperation and respect. In Belle's Tales of Friendship (1999), a spin-off of the film series, Belle owns a bookstore in which she teaches valuable lessons to children by reading and retelling well-known stories and fairy tales, narrating four Disney animated shorts: The Three Little Pigs (1933), Peter and the Wolf (1946), The Wise Little Hen (1934) and Morris the Midget Moose (1950). For the first time, Belle appears as both animated and live-action versions of herself, voiced and portrayed by actresses Paige O'Hara and Lyndsey McLeod, respectively. In the television series Sing Me a Story with Belle (1995‚Äì1996), Belle, in a role reprised by McLeod, owns her own music and bookshop, where she is visited by children to whom she tells and sings stories. Belle appeared in the animated television series Disney's House of Mouse and its direct-to- video films Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse and Mickey's House of Villains. In the television series, Belle is voiced by American actress and singer Jodi Benson, while O'Hara reprises her role in the film. A live-action version of Belle appears as a main character in the ABC television series Once Upon a Time, where she serves as the love interest of Rumplestiltskin (who is the show's version of the Beast). She is portrayed by Australian actress Emilie de Ravin. Another live-action version of the character appeared in the 2015 television film Descendants, where she was played by Keegan Connor Tracy and serves as the Queen of the United States of Auradon. The series Sofia the First included a cameo by Belle in a 2013 episode. British actress Amy Jackson who portrayed as Belle opposite Indian actor Vikram, who being portrayed as Beast for sequences in a dreamy song \\"Ennodu Nee Irundhal\\" in the 2015 Tamil language romantic thriller \\"I\\". The original prosthetic make-up for the characters were provided by Sean Foot (Shaun) and Davina Lamont and additional works were done by National Film Award winners‚ÄîChristien Tinsley and Dominie Till. Beauty and the Beast (2017 live action film) English actress Emma Watson portrays Belle in the 2017 live-action version of the film. In January 2015, Emma Watson announced that she would be portraying Belle in a live-action version of the film, which was released in 2017. Beauty and the Beast was the first of the Disney remakes in which an A-list actress portrays a Disney princess. As a feminist and model, Watson suggested several changes to the character in the live-action film. For the costume design, Watson rejected the traditional \\"big princess dress\\" and corset for the golden gown as that would have reduced her mobility, with the gown seen as crucial for marketing the film, while for the village scenes she requested boots instead of ballet slippers to give the character more ruggedness. Nonetheless Belle's attire in the live-action remake largely stays true to its animated predecessor. Thanks to Watson's influence, Belle is not only a bookworm but also an inventor like her father ‚Äì she uses her inventions for everyday chores such as laundry, which in turn provides her with time to pursue her passion for reading. It is also revealed that Belle's mother died of a disease plague during Belle's infancy, consequently Maurice is somewhat overprotective of Belle and does not allow her to leave the village. For instance, Maurice creates \\"music boxes playing tunes from faraway places, in a bid to sate her thirst for exploration\\", as he is unwilling to let Belle be adventurous due to her mother's death, although Belle harbors no hard feelings about this. Watson's portrayal of Belle won her the MTV Movie Award for Best Performance at the 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards and the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress ‚Äì Sci-Fi/Fantasy at the 2017 Teen Choice Awards. She also received nominations for the Empire Award for Best Actress, the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award for \\"Favorite Movie Actress\\" and the Saturn Award for Best Actress. Broadway musical Belle appeared in the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast. The role was originated by actress Susan Egan, who was initially reluctant to audition for Beauty and the Beast because she \\"thought it was a terrible idea for Disney to put a cartoon on Broadway.\\" However, her agent managed to convince her otherwise, and Egan ultimately turned down callbacks for roles in the musicals My Fair Lady, Carousel and Grease in favor of starring as Belle in Beauty and the Beast because she had always wanted to originate a Broadway role. Egan had never watched Beauty and the Beast prior to her audition, relying solely on \\"her own creative instincts\\" instead. Egan's performance earned her a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical at the 48th Tony Awards. A total of seventeen actresses have portrayed Belle in the Broadway musical, among them recording artists Debbie Gibson and Toni Braxton, The Sopranos' Jamie-Lynn Sigler, and Disney Channel alumnae Christy Carlson Romano and Anneliese van der Pol, the latter of whom became Broadway's final Belle when the show ended its thirteen-year-long run in 2007. Actress Sarah Litzsinger remains Broadway's longest-running Belle. A best-selling R&B; singer, Braxton made her Broadway debut when she was cast as Belle in 1998, turning down actress Halle Berry's role in the film Why Do Fools Fall In Love (1998). Braxton's desire to pursue an acting career stemmed from a series of conflicts with the singer's record label at the time, in turn making her the only African American to portray Belle in the show's history. Belle's ballad \\"A Change in Me\\" was written by songwriters Alan Menken and Tim Rice specifically for Braxton. However, the song was ultimately so well-received that it has been included in the musical ever since. During her tenure as Belle, Braxton was stalked by an \\"obsessed fan.\\" The stalker had reportedly \\"bombarded\\" Braxton with threatening e-mails and letters. Several measures were taken to ensure the singer's safety, including forcing Braxton to dress in full disguise when traveling to and from the theatre in addition to reducing her total number of weekly performances from eight to seven. The stalker was eventually arrested and charged with \\"aggravated harassment.\\" Miscellaneous Belle along with Beast and Chip appeared at the 64th Academy Awards as presenters for Best Animated Short Feature. She also makes a brief cameo appearance in Disney's 34th animated feature film The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) during the \\"Out There\\" musical sequence. She was featured as one of the seven Princesses of Heart in the Kingdom Hearts video game series. Belle was also the main character in various comic books based on the film, including one set during Belle's stay at the castle published by Marvel Comics, and a prequel set several years before the film distributed by Disney Comics. In the former, the storylines generally have the servants trying to coax Belle into doing something with the Beast, only for it to backfire and nearly ruin their friendship before they make up. In the latter serial, Belle ends up locked up in a cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she.The New Adventures of Beauty and the Beast, Issue 1; story 2: Bothered, Page 14. Disney Comics, 1993. \\"Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court!

Belle appears in a meet-and- greet attraction at Magic Kingdom's Fantasyland called Enchanted Tales with Belle. In season 18 of Dancing With the Stars, Danica McKellar played Belle while performing a Quickstep on a Disney themed episode. Ginger Zee and Edyta ≈öliwi≈Ñska also both portrayed Belle while performing a Foxtrot and Waltz respectively during the Disney night episode of the 22nd season of Dancing with the Stars. Emma Slater then played Belle while dancing a Foxtrot during the Disney theme night of the show's 24th season. Belle, alongside other Disney Princesses, appeared in the film Ralph Breaks the Internet, as was announced at the 2017 D23 Expo, with Paige O'Hara returning to the role after seven years. Reception Critical response Belle has garnered widespread acclaim from film critics several of whom voiced their preference for the character over her predecessor, Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post described Belle as a \\"compelling\\" character who is \\"more mature, more womanly and less blandly asexual\\" than Ariel, as well as \\"a more worldly girl\\", describing her as \\"a bookworm, with gumption and a mind of her own.\\" Similarly comparing Belle to Ariel, John Hartl of The Seattle Times wrote that, in Beauty and the Beast, \\"there's rarely a sense of deja vu, perhaps because the heroine is so different from 'Mermaid's' dependent Ariel, and her dilemma is more poignant,\\" while Boxoffice scribed, \\"Undoubtedly in response to criticism that the cute little 'Mermaid' Ariel was nothing more than a precocious sexpot, the idea-people behind this beauty‚Äîaptly named Belle ... chose to make her an icon of self-reliance and a voracious reader with a curiosity and love for everything around her.\\" Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail extolled Belle as a \\"smart, courageous ... 'take-charge kind of gal',\\" while crowning her the \\"main attraction of Beauty and the Beast.\\" Emma Cochrane of Empire hailed Belle as \\"a feminist heroine who [is] more rounded than previous Disney characters\\", while Paste's Annlee Ellingson similarly enjoyed the character's \\"feminist kick.\\" Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun wrote that \\"Belle ... is no passive fairy tale princess, but a real live girl, with a spunky personality and her own private agenda.\\" TV Guide wrote that \\"The familiar narrative is strengthened by the independent, self-assured character of Belle,\\" concluding, \\"Unlike Disney heroines from Snow White through Ariel, Belle is smart, knows what she wants, and doesn't spend her time pining away for the love of a handsome prince.\\" Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly praised Belle's heroism, dubbing her \\"the hero\\" of Beauty and the Beast, while Entertainment Weekly's Christian Blauvelt opined, \\"Unlike previous Disney heroines who needed to be rescued by a prince themselves, Belle not only saves the Beast's life, she saves his soul.\\" TLC's Vicki Arkoff received Belle as a \\"smart\\" and \\"sharp-tongued\\" heroine, crediting the character for \\"break[ing] Disney's passive-princess mold.\\" About.com's David Nusair described Belle as an \\"admirable\\" heroine. AllMovie's Don Kaye and Perry Seibert echoed each other's reviews of the character, with Kaye describing both Belle and the Beast as \\"three-dimensional ... complex individuals who defy stereotyping and change over the course of the story,\\" and Seibert calling Belle a \\"strong female character\\" who \\"sidesteps most of the clich√©s surrounding Disney heroines.\\" Common Sense Media hailed Belle as \\"one of Disney's smartest, most independent heroines.\\" Meanwhile, Belle's relationship with the Beast has also been met with positive reviews. About.com's David Nusair wrote that \\"the palpable chemistry between Belle and The Beast ensur[es] that Beauty and the Beast lives up to its reputation as one of the most memorable romances of all time.\\" Describing it as an \\"unconventional romance,\\" Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times opined, \\"The idea of a young woman learning to love a gentle heart hidden beneath a baleful exterior represented a major break with tradition.\\" Likewise, critics enjoyed O'Hara's performance. According to Variety, Belle was \\"magnificently voiced by O‚ÄôHara.\\" The Star-Ledger's Stephen Whitty enjoyed O'Hara's \\"pretty soprano.\\" John Hartl of The Seattle Times wrote, \\"O'Hara does a spirited job of investing the character with warmth, intuition and maturity,\\" while the Sun-Sentinel's Candice Russel felt that O'Hara \\"does a good job of creating Belle as intellectual, wisely feminine and disarmed by the stirrings of her heart.\\" According to the Young Writers Society, Belle remains the best- reviewed Disney Princess to-date. One of the character's few negative reviews was written by Ethan Alter of Television Without Pity, who opined: Emma Watson's portrayal as Belle in the 2017 film was generally well-received by critics. A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that Watson \\"perfectly embodies Belle‚Äôs compassion and intelligence.\\" The Washington Posts Ann Hornaday complimented Watson's performance, describing it as \\"alert and solemn\\" while noting her singing ability as \\"serviceable enough to get the job done\\". Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times also lauded Watson's performance writing that she \\"is all pluck and spunk and sass and smarts and fierce independence as Belle\\". Stephen Whitty of the New York Daily News described Watson's portrayal of Belle as \\"breakthrough\\". While Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph did not find Watson to be \\"a flawless Belle\\", he did overall say that \\"she‚Äôs good: that girl-next-door winsomeness and a sweet, clear singing voice see her through.\\" He also remarked her portrayal of Belle as \\"dazzles\\" and \\"ideal\\". For her performance as Belle, Watson won the MTV Movie Award for Best Performance as well as the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress ‚Äì Sci-Fi/Fantasy. She also received nominations for the Empire Award for Best Actress, the Saturn Award for Best Actress and the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Movie Actress. Feminist analysis Jezebel determined that Belle \\"is often held up as the standard of the 'feminist' Disney princess.\\" According to Tales, Then and Now: More Folktales as Literary Fictions for Young Adults author Anna E. Altmann, Disney heavily promoted Beauty and the Beast as \\"a feminist fairy tale\\" due to Belle's characterization and role in the film. In his book Hearing a Film, Seeing a Sermon: Preaching and Popular Movies, author Timothy B. Cargal agreed that the character indicated \\"Disney's ... continued efforts to reshape their heroines for a more feminist age.\\" According to Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia author Claudia Mitchell, Belle's feminism was influenced by third-wave feminism and the relatively new concept of girl power during the 1990s. Feminist critics have been generally mixed in their analyses of Belle, arguing over whether or not the character is in fact \\"feminist enough.\\" Although Beauty and the Beast was initially lauded upon release for starring a \\"forward thinking and feminist\\" heroine, critics tend to agree that, in spite of Belle's independence and resentment towards Gaston, Beauty and the Beast essentially remains a romance about a girl who finally \\"meets her ideal man.\\" Acknowledging that Belle \\"represented significant change from [her] sweet, mop-wielding predecessors,\\" Twilight and History author Nancy Reagin observed that \\"the end result of fulfillment through marriage has been maintained.\\" Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle cited Belle as an example of \\"pseudo- feminism\\" because she rejects one man, Gaston, in favor of another, a prince. While commending Belle for \\"seeing past the beast's appearance,\\" Judith Welikala of The Independent in the end accused the character of \\"melting back into the role of wife when he turns back into a handsome prince.\\" Fairy Tale author Andrew Teverson referred to Belle as Disney's attempt to address \\"feminist criticism of its representation of women in earlier films,\\" but ultimately criticized the character's curiosity for \\"extend[ing] only to romance,\\" additionally accusing her of being \\"a zealous individualist with a pathological hostility to common men and women.\\" Meanwhile, Stylist ranked Belle among the most feminist Disney characters, describing her as an \\"incredibly intelligent\\" woman who \\"doesn't stand for a man who considers her as just a piece of meat ... she wants someone who loves her for her mind too.\\" Acknowledging the character's \\"feminist longings,\\" Daniel Eagen, author of America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, cited Belle as Disney's \\"modern-day corrective to Snow White.\\" Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works author Phyllis Frus wrote that, initially, Beauty and the Beast does not seem \\"remotely feminist.\\" However, the author did acknowledge Belle as \\"an appealing character with a noticeable feminist streak,\\" but in the end criticized Disney's Consumer Products of reversing what the film had nearly accomplished by inducting the character into the Disney Princess franchise. In Refinery29's \\"Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses As Feminist Role Models,\\" author Vanessa Golembewski ranked the character eighth but described her personality and ambitions as \\"confusing.\\" Complex's Tara Aquino described Belle as \\"a kinda feminist ... who's well-read, self-sufficient, and with standards high enough that she doesn't fall for the town's brain-dead pretty boy.\\" Commentators have generally reacted more cynically towards Belle's relationship with the film's male characters, particularly the Beast, questioning its morality. Writing for the University of Central Florida, Faith Dickens felt that after Belle's introduction, the character becomes little more than \\"a vehicle for exploring the Beast's dilemmas,\\" while her initial pining for adventure is replaced by romance. Dickens went on to criticize the fact that while Belle appears to be \\"perfect the way she is,\\" the Beast \\"need[s] to be reformed.\\" Anna E. Altmann, author of Tales, Then and Now: More Folktales as Literary Fictions for Young Adults, disliked the fact that Belle appears to share a motherly relationship with both the Beast and Maurice. Altman also panned the fact that Belle's interest in reading appears to be limited to fairy tales, ultimately dismissing the character as little more than \\"a feisty North American version of\\" Beaumont's heroine. Orange Coast writer Henry A. Giroux felt that Belle serves as little more than \\"a prop for resolving the Beast's problems.\\" Sonia Saraiya of Nerve' ranked Belle the sixth most feminist Disney Princess, writing that, unlike Ariel, \\"Belle's sass doesn't come from teenage rebellion, but rather from intellectual acuity.\\" Saraiya commended Belle for resisting \\"her village's expectations of what her life should look like,\\" crediting her with being \\"the first princess to express some skepticism about married life.\\" While calling Belle's sacrifice \\"brave,\\" the author also labeled it \\"not much of a step for womankind,\\" in the end accusing her of falling \\"for a domineering man.\\" Similarly, Kit Steinkellner of HelloGiggles expressed concern over the \\"abusive undercurrents running through Belle and Beast‚Äôs relationship.\\" Meanwhile, Bustle's Mary Grace Garis also commended Belle's aspirations and love of reading, but criticized her relationship with the Beast, concluding, \\"Though the ‚Äô90s showed a move toward princesses wanting to buck conventions and free themselves from their fathers (or the town misogynist) the endgame is the still the same, elaborating, \\"When the movie ends, they‚Äôre still solidly with a man, their dreams of adventure abandoned. Therefore, the Disney renaissance is characterized more by theoretical want of adventure rather than a genuine pursuit.\\" Impact and legacy Deemed an \\"iconoclast\\" by Boxoffice, Belle continues to garner strong recognition for her role in Beauty and the Beast. Established as a cultural icon, the character holds the distinction of being Disney's first feminist princess. Commentators believe that the character's role in Beauty and the Beast as one of Disney's first strong female characters is responsible for changing the way in which women would be depicted in subsequent animated films. According to Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast, before Belle \\"being a Disney princess meant singing songs about how much you love combing your hair with a fork and giving away your voice if it meant you got to marry the guy with that dreamy chiseled jaw\\". The Los Angeles Times' Charles Solomon considers Belle to be among four Disney Princesses responsible for breaking \\"the bonds of convention.\\" About.com's David Nusair agreed that Belle successfully \\"updated the princess formula for an entirely new generation.\\" The Atlantic's Lindsay Lowe echoed Nusair's sentiment, citing Belle as the character responsible for ending Disney's \\"history of ... docile heroines.\\" The Daily Campus' Cathy Schmidt recognized Belle and Ariel as \\"the beginnings of the more modern Disney princesses.\\" Writing for Virgin Media, Limara Salt believes that the character \\"proved that audiences could fall in love with a brown-haired intellectual.\\" A survey conducted by Disney after the film's release determined that Belle's love of books inspired young women to read. Justin Humphreys of The Hook expressed, \\"Belle remains a most successful princess because people can relate\\" to her. Elina Bolokhova of Parenting believes that Belle's \\"bravery and independence helped redefine the meaning of a Disney princess.\\" According to Justine McGrath of Teen Vogue, Belle has \\"become one of the most popular classic Disney princesses of all time.\\" Commending her intelligence and lack of vanity, the character was placed at number one on E!'s ranking of the Disney Princesses, while Cosmopolitan ranked her fourth. In the magazine's \\"Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses\\", Seventeen ranked Belle fifth. Similarly, BuzzFeed also ranked the character fifth, praising her love of reading. A reader poll conducted by BuzzFeed also determined that Belle is the most popular Disney Princess, having garnered 18% of votes. A similar poll conducted by Comingsoon.net also ranked Belle as the best Disney Princess, with 17% of the vote. Belle is the fifth most successful Disney Princess in terms of box office revenue, with Beauty and the Beast having grossed over $350 million. However, Belle was the lowest-selling Disney Princess on eBay in 2013, with sales of less than $7,000 despite the fact that she is often cited as a customer favorite. Belle is considered to be among Disney's most beloved animated heroines, and has been called one of Disney's most beloved princesses. According to Scott Huver of People, the character's \\"popularity remains a force to be reckoned with\\" even 25 years after the film's release. Belle was the only animated heroine nominated for the American Film Institute's greatest heroes in film ranking; only eight women were included on the final list. CNN ranked Belle among \\"Merida and other animated heroines\\", a list recognizing some of Disney's greatest heroines. According to the Daily Mirror, Belle is Disney's second most iconic character, behind only Mickey and Minnie Mouse, describing her as a \\"portrait of bravery, teaching us to look beyond appearances and stand up for what we believe in.\\" Meanwhile, PopMatters ranked Belle Disney's second best hero. Considered to be both a sex symbol and fashion icon, Belle has garnered accolades for both her appearance and costumes. The character was ranked 64th on UGO's list of the most attractive female cartoon characters, while being ranked 14th on Complex's \\"25 Hottest Cartoon Women of All Time\\". E! ranked Belle the second best-dressed Disney Princess, crowning her \\"the most couture of all the Disney princesses.\\" Author Emily Popp went on to praise the character's ballgown for being \\"off the Oscar de la Renta runway,\\" while Vogue included it among the \\"Most Famous Dresses\\", with author Sarah Karmali dubbing it \\"One of the most instantly recognizable dresses in Disney history.\\" Revered as iconic, the dress is currently among the most famous in film history 25 years after its debut. Belle appeared on BuzzFeed's \\"Definitive Ranking Of 72 Disney Princess Outfits\\" four times, ranking the character's green, blue, pink and yellow dresses 51st, 37th, 31st and 15th, respectively. Similarly, Belle's blue, pink, yellow and green costumes were ranked 18th, 10th, ninth and fourth by Official Disney Blogs, whose author believes that the character's ballgown \\"went down in the history books.\\" Belle appeared on Stylist's list of the \\"Best beauty looks in Disney\\" twice, both for the character's hairstyles. Entertainment Weekly ranked Belle's hair fifth in the magazine's \\"Disney Princesses: Ranking Their Hairdos ‚Äì and Don'ts!\\" Belle helped establish Woolverton as a \\"legendary screenwriter\\"; the writer continues to be commended for her dedication to creating strong female characters; ever since Belle, the majority of Woolverton's female characters have been headstrong, independent women, namely Nala in The Lion King (1994), Mulan in Mulan (1998), Alice in Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Maleficent in Maleficent (2014). Susan Wloszczyna of Indiewire wrote that \\"Woolverton set a new standard for fully fleshed-out fairy-tale heroines ... with Belle\\", in turn paving the way for The Hunger Games' Katniss Everdeen, and Frozen's Anna and Elsa (2013). Woolverton remains protective of Belle, explaining, \\"[she] was my first-born child, so there‚Äôs a little bit of possessiveness, which really I had to let it go\\". Beauty and the Beast, Belle performs the film's opening number, \\"Belle\\", which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 64th Academy Awards in 1992. In 1998, O'Hara was nominated for an Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Female Performer in an Animated Feature Production for reprising her role as Belle in the second of Beauty and the Beast's three direct-to-video sequels, Belle's Magical World. To commemorate her work on Beauty and the Beast and various contributions to Disney, O'Hara was honored with a Disney Legends award on August 19, 2011. Disney hired Spanish actress Pen√©lope Cruz to pose as Belle in photographer Annie Leibovitz's Disney Dream Portrait Series, while actor Jeff Bridges posed as the Beast.

The screenplay is derived, in part, from a \\"kiss-and-tell\\" book, N√©lida by Marie d'Agoult (1848), about her affair with Liszt. Depicting the flamboyant Liszt as the first classical pop star, Lisztomania features contemporary rock star Roger Daltrey (of The Who) as Franz Liszt. The film was released the same year as Tommy, which also starred Daltrey and was directed by Russell. Rick Wakeman, from the progressive rock band Yes, composed the Lisztomania soundtrack, which included synthesiser arrangements of works by Liszt and Wagner. He also appears in the film as the Nordic god of thunder, Thor. Daltrey and Russell wrote the lyrics for the soundtrack, and Daltrey provided vocals. Of the other rock celebrities appearing in the film, Ringo Starr, drummer of The Beatles, appears as the Pope. The term \\"Lisztomania\\" was coined by the German romantic literary figure Heinrich Heine to describe the massive public response to Liszt's virtuosic piano performances. At these performances, there were allegedly screaming women, and the audience was sometimes limited to standing room only. This film was first to use the new Dolby Stereo sound system. Plot summary Rather than presenting a straightforward narrative, the film tells of Liszt's life through a series of surrealistic episodes blending fact and fantasy, and full of anachronistic elements. At the start of the film, Liszt is caught in bed with Marie d'Agoult by her husband the Count d'Agoult. The Count challenges Liszt to a fight with sabres but Marie begs the count to let her share Liszt's fate. The Count then orders his staff to trap Liszt and Marie into the body of a piano, nailing it shut, and then leaving it on railroad tracks. This 19th century steam engine on the Bluebell Railway was featured in the film The scene is then shown to be a flashback triggered by the camera flash of photographers backstage before one of Liszt's concerts. Richard Wagner appears and Liszt introduces him to his circle of colleagues including Gioachino Rossini, Hector Berlioz, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, and Hans von B√ºlow. Liszt then pays Wagner to allow him to perform a variation on a theme from Rienzi. At the concert, Wagner is put off by Liszt's crowd-pleasing showmanship at the expense of serious musicianship, which includes adding the melody of Chopsticks to his Rienzi variation. However the crowd, consisting entirely of young screaming girls, go wild at Liszt's performance, storming the stage. Liszt uses von B√ºlow to proposition potentially wealthy females in the audience during his performance. One of them is Princess Carolyn, who relays to Liszt her address in Russia. The next scene shows Marie's and Liszt's domestic life plagued by jealousy over his constant touring and his infidelities. At this point they have three children, the oldest being Cosima. Domestic life has also strained Liszt's creativity. Liszt prepares to depart to St. Petersburg to play for the Tsar. Marie threatens to abandon him if he decides to go. Liszt then suggests to Cosima that he would sell his soul to the Devil to be able to compose brilliant music again. As Liszt is leaving, Cosima consoles him that she will pray to God every day so that Liszt will meet the Devil and be able to sell his soul to him. In Russia, Liszt meets Princess Carolyn at her court. She begins to seduce him, offering him the ability to compose the brilliant music he wanted in exchange for total control of his life. In one of the most ostentatious scenes of the movie, Liszt then experiences a hallucination where the women of Princess Carolyn's court assail him but then become seduced by his music which strokes his libido and gives him a 10-foot erection. Carolyn sinisterly observes from afar as the women celebrate his giant erection with a chorus line. The women then drag Liszt and his erection to a guillotine in which Carolyn reveals that the bargain for Liszt's newfound musical prolificity is the forfeiture of his libertinism. The next scene shows Liszt in Dresden during the May Uprising, conflicted about not supporting his friends in the revolt and spending all his time isolated to compose music (it is also heavily implied that Marie and his two youngest children have been killed). Wagner, now a political criminal on the lam, reappears and asks Liszt for money so that he can escape the country with his family. As Liszt tends Wagner's wounds, Wagner secretly drugs Liszt, who passes out. Wagner then reveals himself to be a vampire with a mission to write music that will inspire a new German nationalism. He then proceeds to suck Liszt's blood and compose on the piano. Before departing, Wagner leaves him his latest political pamphlet, a Superman comic (a play on Friedrich Nietzsche's Superman). Liszt and Carolyn travel to the Vatican to get married after the Pope agrees to grant her a divorce from her husband. The wedding is ultimately voided by the intervention of her husband and the Tsar. Furious at the Pope's political impotence, Carolyn threatens to write an anthology on her disagreements with the Church (Causes int√©rieures de la faiblesse ext√©rieure de l'√âglise en 1870). Liszt then proposes that he will join the Church as an abbot. Liszt's life as an abbot is shown to be disobedient as he is caught in bed with a woman. The Pope then explains that Wagner has seduced Cosima as his wife and has begun to lead a devilish cult organised around his music. He tasks Liszt with travelling to Wagner's castle to exorcise him and return him to the Christian faith or else Liszt will be excommunicated and his music banned. Liszt travels to Wagner's castle, where he observes a secret ritual portraying a devilish Jew raping several blonde-haired Germanic nymphs. Wagner then appears with Cosima, dressed in Superman outfits, and sings how \\"the flowering youth of Germany was raped by 'the beast'\\" and that a \\"new messiah\\" will soon arrive to drive out the beast. At the conclusion of the song, Cosima marches the audience, composed entirely of children, out with a Nazi salute as they chant that they \\"will be the master race\\". Liszt confronts Wagner, who is unaware of what Liszt has seen, and inquires about his ambitions. Wagner confesses that he has been building a mechanical Viking Siegfried to rid the country of Jews. When Wagner awakens Siegfried with his music, the creature turns out to be crass and slow-witted. Liszt sneaks holy water into Wagner's drink but the water has no effect. Wagner then reveals himself to Liszt as a vampire and threatens to steal his music so that Wagner's Viking can live. Liszt rushes to the piano and plays music, exorcising Wagner and bringing him to near death. Cosima, witnessing Wagner's moribund state, imprisons Liszt and then resurrects Wagner in a Nazi ceremony as a Frankenstein-Hitler wielding a machine-gun guitar. Trapped, Liszt observes as Cosima leads the Wagner-Hitler to gun down the town's Jews, after which she kills Liszt by stabbing a needle through the heart of a voodoo doll made in his likeness. In Heaven, Liszt is reunited with the women he has romanced in his life and Cosima, though it is never explained how she got there after killing Liszt, who regret their behaviour towards him and each other and finally live in harmony. In the final episode, Liszt and the women decide to fly down to Earth in a spaceship to destroy Wagner-Hitler who has now ravaged Berlin in a fiery machine-gun frenzy. Once Wagner-Hitler is destroyed, Liszt sings that he has found \\"peace at last\\".

The Pueblo of Namb√© has existed since the 14th century and is a member of the Eight Northern Pueblos.\\"Nambe Pueblo\\". New Mexico, Land of Enchantment. New Mexico Tourism Department. Retrieved March 9, 2018. It was a primary cultural, economic, and religious center at the time of the arrival of Spanish colonists in the very early 17th century. The community of Nambe is separate from the pueblo. Namb√© was one of the Pueblos that organized and participated in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, trying to expel the Spanish from the area. Name Namb√© is the Spanish version of a similar-sounding Tewa word, which can be interpreted loosely as meaning \\"rounded earth.\\" The word \\"pueblo\\" stems from the Spanish word for \\"village.\\" Pueblo refers both to the Southwestern style architecture and the people themselves. Demographics The 2010 census found that 1,818 people lived in the CDP, while 568 people in the United States reported being exclusively Namb√©Census 2010 American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File (AIANSF) - Sample Data, Pueblo of Nambe alone (H46) and 723 people reported being Namb√© exclusively or in combination with another group.Census 2010 American Indian and Alaska Native Summary File (AIANSF) - Sample Data, Pueblo of Nambe alone or in any combination (H46) & (100-299) or (300, A01-Z99) or (400-999) Language The Namb√© language is a dialect of the Tewa language, also called Tano, which belongs to the Kiowa-Tanoan language family. History Origin and early history Scholars believe that all Pueblo peoples are descended from the Anasazi, possibly from the Mogoll√≥n, and other ancient peoples. In contemporary times, the people and their archaeological culture were referred to as Anasazi for historical purposes. The Navajo, who were not their descendants, called them by this term. Reflecting historic traditions, the term was used to mean \\"ancient enemies\\". Contemporary Puebloans do not want this term to be used. As the Ancestral Puebloans abandoned their canyon homeland due to social upheaval and climate change, they migrated to other areas. Eventually the Namb√© emerged as a culture in their new homeland in present-day New Mexico. European contact The Spanish conquistador Juan de O√±ate arrived with armed forces in the area in 1598. He forced Namb√© Pueblo, as was the case with other pueblos, to start paying him taxes with cotton, crops and labor. Catholic missionaries also came into the area, threatening native religious beliefs. They renamed pueblos with saints' names, and the first church was built in Namb√© Pueblo in the early 1600s. The Spanish introduced new foods to the native communities, including peaches, peppers and wheat. In 1620 a royal decree assigned civil offices to each Pueblo.

However, even the smallest species can inflict painful bites requiring stitches. In addition, a small child may be of a similar size to the prey of some of the crocodilian species incapable of preying on adult humans. It has been estimated that about 1,000 people are killed by crocodilians each year.CrocBITE, Worldwide Crocodilian Attack Database: About human-crocodile conflict. Charles Darwin University, Northern Territory, Australia. Species involved in attacks Makeshift barrier in Uganda to lessen the risk of Nile crocodile attacks The two species with the most well-known and documented reputation for preying on humans are the Nile crocodile and saltwater crocodile, and these are the perpetrators of the vast majority of both fatal and non-fatal crocodilian attacks. Each year, hundreds of deadly attacks are attributed to the Nile crocodile in Sub-Saharan Africa. Attacks by saltwater crocodiles often occur in Southeast Asia, Australia, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. Reviews indicate that at least half of all attacks by the Nile and saltwater crocodiles are fatal (in Australia, however, only about 25% of saltwater crocodile attacks are fatal). The mugger crocodile is also very dangerous to humans, killing several people in India every year and with a fatality rate (slightly less than half of all attacks are fatal) that is almost as high. Unlike the predatory attacks by Nile and saltwater crocodiles, victims of mugger crocodiles are often not eaten, indicating that many attacks by this species are territorial or defensive rather than predatory.Sideleau, B., and Britton A.R.C.

Background An accurate count of annual crocodile attacks on humans is difficult to obtain. Many of the areas in which humans and large crocodiles come into contact are remote, impoverished, or in areas of political unrest. Crocodile attacks are not always reported to local authorities, and some reports are difficult to verify. Nevertheless, some information does exist: for example, it was reported by CAMPFIRE in Zimbabwe that in the first ten months of the year in 2005 crocodiles were the number one cause of death in humans where wildlife was involved ‚Äì with the number of deaths cited as 13. Unlike other \\"man-eating\\" crocodiles, such as the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile lives in proximity to human populations, so contact is more frequent. Although most attacks are not reported, the Nile crocodile is estimated to kill hundreds (possibly thousands) of people each year, which is more than all other crocodilian species combined.Wood, The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. Sterling Pub Co Inc (1983), One study posited the number of attacks by Nile crocodiles per year as 275 to 745, of which 63% are fatal, as opposed to an estimated 30 attacks per year by saltwater crocodiles, of which 50% are fatal. In both species, the mean size of crocodiles involved in nonfatal attacks was about 3 m (9.8 ft) as opposed to a reported range of 2.5‚Äì5 m (8.2‚Äì16 ft) or larger for crocodiles responsible for fatal attacks. Since a majority of fatal attacks are believed to be predatory in nature, the Nile crocodile can be considered the most prolific predator of humans among wild animals. The most deaths in a single crocodile attack incident may have occurred during the Battle of Ramree Island, on February 19, 1945, in what is now Myanmar. Nine hundred soldiers of an Imperial Japanese Army unit, in an attempt to retreat from the Royal Navy and rejoin a larger battalion of the Japanese infantry, crossed through ten miles of mangrove swamps that contained saltwater crocodiles. Twenty Japanese soldiers were captured alive by the British, and almost five hundred are known to have escaped Ramree. Many of the remainder may have been eaten by the crocodiles, although since this incident took place during an active military conflict, it is impossible to know how many deaths can be directly attributed to the crocodiles instead of combat- related causes.Frank McLynn: The Burma Campaign: Disaster Into Triumph, 1942-45.

The Miners compete in the Men's NBL1 and play their home games at the Ballarat Sports and Events Centre. The team is affiliated with Ballarat Basketball Association, the major administrative basketball organisation in the region. For sponsorship reasons, they are known as the GMHBA Ballarat Miners. Their sister team, the Ballarat Rush, play in the Women's NBL1. Team history Background The Ballarat Basketball Association Inc. was incorporated in 1966 and then built its own freehold facility in 1969 on the corner of Grevillea Road and Dowling Street in Wendouree to later become known as the Ballarat Minerdome. Backed by a flourishing local basketball program and facilities at the forefront of regional basketball associations, it was announced in 1985 that Ballarat would lodge an application to join the South East Basketball League (SEBL). Basketball Ballarat formed a separate independent club to arrange the new venture and the Elite Teams department was established. The team chosen to represent Ballarat was called the Ballarat Miners and in 1986 the Miners were admitted into the SEBL. The Dynasty (1987‚Äì1996) Having entered the league in 1986, the Miners were immediately a force to be reckoned with. With Brian Goorjian at the helm, Ballarat reached the ultimate goal, with the South Conference Championship in 1987, only a year after their introduction. Goorjian departed at the end of the 1987 season and was replaced by Al Westover, who subsequently took the team to a Conference three-peat from 1989 to 1991, taking the South Conference for the first two years before following it up with the East Conference when moving across conferences in 1991. Westover was honoured with the inaugural Coach of the Year award in 1990 for his leadership with Ballarat throughout those three years. The Miners accomplishments continued after the departure of Westover at the end of 1991, with Eric Lowe taking the side to conference runners-up in 1992 before Brendan Joyce took over in 1993. In Joyce's first season, the Miners went through the regular season with a stellar record of 20‚Äì4, eventually losing the Conference Semi-final and finishing second overall. But the following two years they again achieved the ultimate success with two CBA National Championships with win/loss ratios of 18‚Äì4 and 19‚Äì3. Joyce went one better than Westover, collecting consecutive Coach of the Year awards for his leadership over 1994 and 1995. 1996 saw Paul Hotchin take over as head coach and with an array of stars in his line-up, he helped take them to another final, eventually losing to North West Tasmania after a regular season record of 16‚Äì6. With the introduction of the SEABL Most Valuable Player award, Eric Cooks made it his own, taking the prize in both 1989 and 1990. He was also included in the SEABL All-Star side in 1993, 1995 and 1996, and has an individual career winning percentage of over 75%. Cooks tops the SEABL All- time list for blocked shots, is fourth in total points, and second for total rebounds. Small forward Eric Hayes was a part of the 1994 All-Star team and has played more games than any other SEABL player. Hayes also sits second for All-time points scored, third for total rebounds and first for free throws attempted and made. During the four-year period with Hotchin and Joyce at the helm, Ballarat went 73‚Äì17 for the regular seasons, while also recording a 2‚Äì2 win-loss ratio in Conference Finals, and a 7‚Äì1 record for National Finals, to finish 82‚Äì20 in a period of dominance in the SEABL. This era saw the Ballarat Miners create one of the most successful dynasties in the history of Australian basketball. New era (2014‚Äìpresent) The Miners burst into the post-season in 2014 after an eight-year hiatus and again in 2015. Both matches were lost on the road, falling short of Dandenong each time in conference semi-finals. After missing the post-season in 2016, the Miners reached the SEABL South Conference final in 2017, marking their first conference final appearance in 16 years. In early 2020, the Miners and Rush teams moved their main competition games from the older Ballarat Minerdome to the new Ballarat Sports and Events Centre. Following the postponement of the 2020 NBL1 South season due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Miners withdrew from any involvement in the 2020 season.

The main offices are located in Wellsboro in Tioga County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The state forest was named for the Tioga tribe of the Seneca, a Native American people, whose homeland was in the region. The Seneca language word \\"Tioga\\" means 'the meeting of two rivers' in English. Prior to the July 1, 2005 realignment of Pennsylvania State Forest Districts, Tioga State Forest included almost all state forest lands in Tioga County and Bradford County, and encompassed . After realignment, the state forest tracts in Bradford County became part of the new Loyalsock State Forest. Currently, the forest is mostly located in Tioga County and only includes small areas within Bradford and Lycoming Counties. History Tioga State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and iron companies harvested the old-growth forests, clearcutting the forests and leaving behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system. Most of the land acquired by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was purchased from land holding and lumber companies. The lumber companies had stripped the land of vast stands of old growth Eastern hemlock and white pine during the lumber era that swept throughout the mountains of Pennsylvania during the mid-to-late 19th century. The harvested timber was floated down Pine Creek and its tributaries to the Susquehanna Boom on the West Branch Susquehanna River near Williamsport. The lumber companies left behind a land that was stripped of most of its trees and was scattered with tree stumps and the dried tops of trees that easily igniting causing wildfires that slowed the growth of the now thriving second growth forest of hardwoods. The establishment of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression by President Franklin D. Roosevelt was vital to the recovery of the forests of Tioga State Forest. Several CCC camps were scattered throughout Tioga State Forest. The young men of the CCC worked to clear the forest and streams of dried underbrush. They cleared roads and trails throughout the forest and built the recreation facilities found at Leonard Harrison and Colton Point State Parks along the Pennsylvania Grand Canyon. Birch trees in Tioga State Forest were used during the mid-20th century in the birch oil industry. Birch stills were built throughout the forest to produce the oil, which was used as an industrial lubricant. The last birch still in Tioga State Forest was shut down in 1972.

Early career Hans-Hermann Hupfeld was born on his parents' farm in Klein-Varchow, Mecklenburg, Germany. He obtained a degree in physics and worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut, Berlin Dahlem, from 1929 until 1932 with Prof. Otto Hahn and Prof. Lise Meitner. His research during that time resulted in the discovery of the so-called Meitner‚ÄìHupfeld effect. The Meitner-Hupfeld effect is an anomalously large scattering of Gamma rays by heavy elements. Later on, the Meitner‚ÄìHupfeld effect was explained by a broad theory from which evolved the Standard Model, a theory for explaining the structure of the atomic nucleus. The anomalous gamma-ray behavior was eventually ascribed to electron‚Äìpositron pair production and annihilation. Although Professor Meitner was recognized for her work, Hupfeld is usually ignored, and little or no account of his life exists. His name is misspelled as Heinz Hupfeld, instead of Hans-Hermann Hupfeld in publications from the early '30s. Later career Disgruntled by lack of recognition, Hupfeld left the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut in 1932 (now known as the Max Planck Society) in Berlin and went, because of Germany's bad economic situation at that time, to help in the construction of buildings using a sustainable earthen technology known as the \\"Dunne loam loaf\\" technique,See \\"Building with Earth: Design and Technology of a Sustainable Architecture, by Gernot Minke, page 74 pioneered in Europe by Pastor Gustav von Bodelschwingh, Ruhrgebiet, Germany. From there he went to the recently founded \\"Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst\\" (FAD) also created by v. Bodelschwingh, but was very suddenly incorporated by the Nazi regime into the \\"Reichsarbeitsdienst\\" (RAD) at Schloss Simmenau, High Silesia and Oppeln/OS (after World War II, known as Opole, Poland). From there he left to serve as a Reserve Officer until his death at the age of 36 during World War II in the Russian Caucasus. According to letters sent by the German army to his widow, he was killed on November 11, 1942, in Nisch Ssaniba, North Ossetia, Caucasus. There are a number of curious coincidences in his life with notable events in Physics: the Annus Mirabilis Papers and the 100th anniversary of his birthday coincided with the United Nations' World Year of Physics.

Part of the Laguna territory is included in the Albuquerque metropolitan area, chiefly around Laguna's Route 66 Resort and Casino. The name, Laguna, is Spanish (meaning \\"small lake\\") and derives from the lake on their reservation. This body of water was formed by an ancient dam that was constructed by the Laguna people. After the Pueblo Revolt of 1680‚Äì1696, the Mission San Jos√© de la Laguna was erected by the Spanish at the old pueblo (now Old Laguna) and finished around July 4, 1699. Geography Their reservation lies in parts of four counties: In descending order of included land area they are Cibola, Sandoval, Valencia and Bernalillo Counties. It includes the six villages of Encinal, Laguna, Mesita, Paguate, Paraje, and Seama. The reservation is west of the city of Albuquerque. The reservation consists of approximately .see \\"Welcome to the Pueblo of Laguna\\" The Laguna Pueblo (and the Acoma Pueblo) lie in the river basin of the Rio San Jose.

History  Grinding maize in Laguna Pueblo, c. 1900s Ceramic Laguna canteen The people of Laguna have a long history of residing in and farming along the Rio San Jos√© in west-central New Mexico. Laguna history begins long before the advent of written records in the Southwest. It is a common misconception that the Pueblo of Laguna began in 1699, at the time of the construction of the Mission. However, research of 1,449 archaeological sites and an anthropological analysis of the Laguna oral history have firmly proven that people have inhabited the area ranging from 6500 B.C. to the present.T.J. Ferguson and Barbara J. Mills, 2012, Supplemental Report: Archaeological Sites on the Laguna Indian Reservation. Unpublished paper on file at the Pueblo of Laguna Tribal Historic Preservation Office. The Acoma Pueblo and Pueblo of Laguna have many ties, including location, language and a shared high school. The Pueblo of Laguna has a well-established Tribal Law system. The Pueblo of Laguna has participated as a \\"Weed and Seed\\" tribe . This Department of Justice program studied the enforcement of law and effectiveness of social programs on Native American lands. The Irish surname Riley was adopted by many members of the Laguna tribe in the 1800s, for legal use in European-American culture, while they retained their Laguna names for tribal use. Education Primary and middle school education is provided by the Laguna Department of Education, which also operates Early Childhood program and adult education programs. The high school is shared with nearby Acoma Pueblo. Lagunas value intellectual activity and education, so a scholarship program has led to many well-educated Lagunas. Uranium mining on Pueblo of Laguna land has contributed to this scholarship program as well as to skilled labor learning among Laguna members. Lagunas and other Pueblos enjoy baseball. Like many Pueblos, the Laguna people are skilled in pottery. Language Laguna man and woman in traditional clothing Lagunas traditionally speak the Western variety of Keresan. Most Laguna elders do not speak English. Economy The Laguna Development Corporation; founded in 1998, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Pueblo of Laguna. Laguna Development is a federally chartered tribal corporation formed under Section 17 of the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act. The company develops and operates the tribe's retail-based outlets, including two travel centers, a supermarket, a convenience store, an RV park, an arcade, a Superette and three casinos on the Pueblo of Laguna reservation that spans Cibola County, Bernalillo, Valencia and Sandoval counties. Laguna Construction Company, a construction company owned by the Pueblo of Laguna, was one of the largest U.S. contractors in Iraq, with reconstruction contracts worth more than $300 million since 2004. In addition to its headquarters at the pueblo, Laguna Industries, Inc. maintains offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; San Antonio and Houston, Texas; Baghdad, Iraq, and Amman, Jordan. In 2007, Laguna Construction employed 75 people, most of whom belong to the pueblo. Several Laguna Pueblo businesses are along tourist and truck route corridors that attract New Mexico tourists, long- and short-haul truck drivers, and residents of nearby Albuquerque. Other Laguna Development businesses provide basic services to local tribal communities.

During his career Mason served as the Chairman and CEO of the Kelvinator Corporation (1928-1937), Chairman and CEO of the Nash-Kelvinator Corporation (1937-1954), and Chairman and CEO of American Motors Corporation (1954).  Early life and education Mason was born in Valley City, North Dakota. Mason received his education at the University of Michigan where he designed a specific course for engineering students that combined three years of engineering and a final year in business administration. Mason had worked for local garages in his youth and upon receiving his degree from Michigan, he accepted a position with Studebaker. Mason changed employers several times before entering military service during World War I. In 1921, Mason secured a position with Walter P. Chrysler at Maxwell-Chalmers, which Chrysler had reorganized and would use to develop Chrysler brand automobiles. From Maxwell- Chalmers, Mason went to Copeland Products of Detroit in 1926 before becoming the President of the Kelvinator Corporation, a leader in the emerging electric refrigeration industry. Under Mason, Kelvinator quadrupled its profits and became second only to General Motors Frigidaire product line in home refrigeration sales despite the effects of the Great Depression. Career  Nash Motors  When Charles W. Nash, founder of Nash Motors began looking for his successor, he turned to Mason upon the recommendation of Walter Chrysler. Mason initially rebuffed Nash‚Äôs offer; however when Nash asked what it would take to bring Mason over to Nash, Mason stated that he would not take the position if Kelvinator was not included in the deal. Nash saw merit in this idea; General Motors owned Frigidaire, Borg-Warner owned Norge Appliance, and Chrysler operated its own air conditioning division, Airtemp. Nash and Mason came to terms and the deal announced in November 1936. The two firms merged to form Nash-Kelvinator Corporation with Mason as its CEO. By 1940, Mason continued to grow Kelvinator‚Äôs market share and returned Nash to profitable status. Continuing Charles Nash's decades of success by building cars \\"embodying honest worth ... [at] a price level which held out possibilities of a very wide market.\\" Mason began exploring the possibilities of aerodynamics for automobile designs and used of wind tunnel tests during World War II. Nash‚Äôs Chief of engineering, Nils Erik Wahlberg, worked with Theodore (Ted) Ulrich in the development of Nash's all-new and radically styled 1949 Airflyte models. This was a comprehensive adoption of aerodynamic principles in a low-priced mass-produced post-war automobile. The Airflyte's design also extended its body over car's front wheels, and these enshrouded front wheels remained a Nash hallmark until 1957. Mason was a large and gregarious man, standing well more than six feet (183 cm) tall and weighing over . Despite his large physical size, he was fascinated with small cars, especially the concept of a small, inexpensive car and Nash‚Äôs marketing and strategic management. As a result, the automaker introduced three compact car lines: * Nash Rambler ‚Äì Mason‚Äôs vision for a small inexpensive compact car was changed in light of raw goods shortages, so Mason directed the car to emerge not as a stripped down economy car, but as an upmarket compact sedan- convertible. * Nash-Healey ‚Äì the first American sports car after the Great Depression and developed with partners in Great Britain and Italy. * Nash Metropolitan ‚Äì a subcompact car built in cooperation with Great Britain's Austin Motors. However, General Motors and Ford Motor Company were locked in a battle for market supremacy that started in 1945 when Ford's new president, Henry Ford II, had a burning desire to make his company number one again. By 1953, all of the independent automobile manufacturers were also feeling the after effects of Henry Ford‚Äôs plan to dump tens of thousands of vehicles into the market at discounted prices to try and wrestle the top automotive manufacturing title from GM. General Motors responded by doing the same. With the market flooded by inexpensive cars, Studebaker, Packard, Willys, Hudson, Kaiser Motors, and Nash were all unable to sell their vehicles at loss leader prices to keep up with Ford and GM. The \\"frantic 1953‚Äì54 Ford/GM price war\\" devastated the remaining \\"independent\\" automakers.  Legacy with AMC  The smaller automakers responded to their shrinking market shares by conducting formal and informal merger talks. Willys and Kaiser merged in 1953. Mason brought together Nash and the Hudson Motor Car Company to cut costs and strengthen their sales organizations to meet the intense competition from the Big Three. This merger occurred on May 1, 1954 to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). At the same time, he tried to bring Studebaker and Packard into AMC. He had informal discussions with James J. Nance of Packard to outline his strategic vision for competing with the Big Three. An agreement was reached for parts-sharing arrangements between AMC and Packard and the new Packard V8 engine and Packard's Ultramatic automatic transmission would be used in the 1955 Nash Ambassador and Hudson Hornet models. In July 1954, Packard acquired Studebaker. Within months after the formation of AMC, George Mason died on October 8, 1954, at age 63 of acute pancreatitis and pneumonia in Detroit, Michigan and was buried in White Chapel Memorial Cemetery. Mason's prot√©g√©, AMC Vice President George W. Romney, succeeded Mason as Chairman and CEO. One of Romney's first acts was to stop rumors that there were additional merger talks between AMC and Studebaker-Packard Corporation or any automakers. According to Mason's obituary in Time magazine, had AMC and Studebaker-Packard joined, it would have resulted in the second largest automaker in the world, behind General Motors.  Legacy in conservation  Following his death it was disclosed that Mason, a former president of Ducks Unlimited, had left a gift to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources consisting of land with of shoreline along the Au Sable River. The gift was contingent that the area be used as a permanent game preserve, that no part shall ever be sold by the state, and that no camping be allowed in the area for 25 years. The Michigan DNR has continued to uphold the no camping restriction within the Mason tract. In accordance with Mason's wishes, the tract remains free of all development with the exception of a simple log chapel that was constructed on the property by the Mason family in 1960.

Personal life Delgado, born on 14 May 1934, in Chin√°cota, Colombia, was the son of Rita Elisa Morales. He had a sister who resented him. In 1941 he saw his father commit suicide and held his mother responsible for this incident his entire life. He was said to have been an excellent student and studied medicine. A refugee in the streets of New York, he returned to Bogot√° after a fight with a thief. Delgado then lived by teaching private English lessons and was taking graduate studies at the Universidad Javeriana in Bogot√°. He was no longer able to develop friendships, for which he blamed his mother. As the years went by, he grew more and more resentful of her. U.S. Military Service According to the National Personnel Records Center, Delgado served with the U.S. Army from August 12, 1975 to August 11, 1978. He was honorably discharged as a Sergeant first class. According to these dates, it's impossible for him to have fought in Vietnam. Fellow soldier Art Fealey, claims to have met Delgado in the 5th infantry, 3rd battalion while in the Panama Canal Zone in 1975. He said Delgado was later stationed at the Army's medical center in El Paso, Texas until 1978. Killing spree Preparation On 3 December 1986, around noon, Delgado entered the Banco de Bogot√° to close his bank account and withdraw his entire deposits of $49,896.93. When the cashier handed him a round number of $49,896.50, Delgado insisted on receiving the remaining 43 cents. Either during the afternoon of the same day, or the next morning, Delgado bought a .32-caliber Smith & Wesson Model 31-1 revolver and 500 rounds of ammunition.La Masacre, Semana (January 5, 1987) Apartment buildings On 4 December at approximately 2:00 p.m., Delgado went to an apartment building at Calle 118 No. 40-11 and entered apartment 304, where Nora Becerra de Rinc√≥n lived together with her 14-year-old daughter Claudia Rinc√≥n, whom Delgado had given lessons in English, as well as her 11-year-old son Julio Eduardo, her mother, and a friend of the latter. Besides Nora Becerra and her daughter, nobody was at home at that time. Delgado gagged and handcuffed Nora Becerra and fatally stabbed her four times with a hunting knife on the couch in the living room. He also gagged Claudia Rinc√≥n, and bound her hands and feet, before stabbing her 22 times and leaving her dead on a bed. The bodies were found the next day by Julio Eduardo. At 4:00 p.m., Delgado was back at the apartment he shared with his mother at Carrera 7, Calle 52. Around 5:30 p.m., after a heated argument with her, he walked up behind Rita Delgado and killed her with a single stab to the back of the neck, afterwards wrapping her body in newspapers, sprinkling it with gasoline, and setting it on fire. Delgado then grabbed his revolver and a briefcase containing five boxes of ammunition and the knife, and ran through the apartment complex screaming \\"¬°Fuego! ¬°Fuego!\\" (Fire! Fire!). He went downstairs and rang at apartment 301, where students In√©s Gordi Galat and Nelsy Patricia Cort√©s were living, saying that he needed to call the fire department. As soon as they opened the door, Delgado killed both women with single shots to the head and then proceeded to apartment 302, where he did the same with Gloria Isabel Agudelo Le√≥n, who had been alarmed by the shooting and opened the door to investigate. Delgado then headed down to the first floor where he rang at apartment 101, again pretending that he needed to call the fire department. The apartment was occupied by four women, Mrs. Berta G√≥mez, who saved her life by jumping out into the courtyard, as well as students Matilde Roc√≠o Gonz√°lez, Mercedes Gamboa, and Mar√≠a Claudia Berm√∫dez Dur√°n, who were all shot. Gonz√°lez, who had already picked up the telephone receiver, and Gamboa both died at the scene, while Maria Berm√∫dez died a few hours later in Hospital San Jos√©. Outside the building, Delgado stared a couple of minutes at a poster, advertising a play of Bodas de Sangre at a local theater. Meanwhile, Mrs. Berta G√≥mez stopped a police patrol and asked them for help, though, seeing the fire on the fourth floor, the officers responded that this was more a case for the firefighters and therefore did not intervene. Delgado eventually left for house number 201 at Carrera 28A No. 51-31, where the Castro family was living, with whom he had been friends for five years. He arrived there about 15 minutes later in a rather agitated state. Against his habit of being a man of rather few words, Delgado talked incessantly, repeated sentences several times, and paced through the living room, declining any of Mrs. Castro's invitations to sit down. According to Clemencia de Castro, Delgado told her that he had come to say farewell, as he had bought a one way ticket and would go on a trip to the U.S., or China. At 6:45 p.m., Delgado left the Castros, assuring them that they would soon hear from him, and went to Pizzer√≠a Pozzetto, an Italian restaurant in the Chapinero district where he ate frequently, discarding the hunting knife on his way. By that time police and journalists were searching for the murderer throughout the city. Restaurant Pozzetto Delgado arrived at the restaurant at around 7:15 p.m., greeted the waiters and ordered half a bottle of red wine and spaghetti bolognese. The waiters noticed that during his meal Delgado went to the restroom several times. After finishing his meal Delgado began to read an American magazine, ordered two screwdriver cocktails, and paid his bill. After drinking a third vodka at around quarter past eight he sat down at the bar to have a fourth. Around 9:15 p.m., Delgado opened fire on the diners. Delgado shot a total of 32 people, twenty of them fatally.Instinto Asesino - La Masacre de Pozzetto, Discovery Channel His method was to corner his victim and shoot them at point-blank range in the forehead and then move on to the next victim. Delgado promised himself not to kill any children, but he accidentally killed a six-year-old girl sitting at an adjacent table when his revolver misfired. When police arrived ten minutes later, Delgado turned his attention to them, holding them off for one minute. He was apparently killed with a shot to the temple by a police officer. There is also a belief that Delgado committed suicide. After some time, police discovered with a comparison of the bullets that Delgado was shot by a police officer while he was reloading.

The book was very successful and received several international awards. Mendoza Zambrano met Delgado at the university in Bogot√° when he was a literature student, and he actually talked to Delgado just a couple of days before the massacre.

The single ‚ÄúElectrica Salsa‚Äù with OFF launched his career in 1986. Lovingly referred to as ‚ÄúPapa Sven‚Äù by his fans, Sven V√§th has made his mark in the music community by being one of Germany‚Äôs ‚Äúpop stars‚Äù in the nineties, running two famous night clubs in Germany, and starting his own company Cocoon, which encompasses a booking agency, record label, and a branch for events. He is recognized for cultivating the underground electronic music scene not just in Germany but in Ibiza as well, with his own night at Amnesia for eighteen years and after-parties at creative locations around the island. Sven V√§th is a major proponent of vinyl, using only two decks and a mixer for his extensive DJ sets, his longest set having been 30 hours. Biography Both of Sven V√§th‚Äôs parents were from East Germany. They escaped separately and met each other by chance in the West when they were very young, in a town near Frankfurt. The two of them married and had three sons, including Sven, while his father was still a painter. Young at heart, his parents would go dancing often and his father wished to open an English pub, which they did. The pub had a small dance floor, where Sven was introduced to a wide range of music, from rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll to disco. In the summer of 1980, V√§th went for the first time to Ibiza after hearing about it from the local scene in Frankfurt, where he was living at the time. Using his job seeker‚Äôs allowance money, V√§th hitchhiked from Barcelona and ended up spending three months on the island, sleeping on beach chairs and distributing flyers for clubs in order to get by. It was that summer he decided that he wanted to become a DJ, after becoming enchanted with Ibiza and his time there. When he returned to Germany, Sven‚Äôs mother asked if he would DJ at his parents' pub. Sven gladly acquiesced. He was 17 at the time. Career Only a year later, in 1982, Sven V√§th was asked to play a residency at the club Dorian Gray in Frankfurt am Main. It was there that he met Michael M√ºnzing and Luca Anziloti and got into music production. In 1985, the three came together as Off (Organisation for Fun) and produced the track ‚ÄúBad News‚Äù, which he brought with him to Ibiza and proffered it to Alfredo, Pippi, and Cesar ‚Äì Ibiza‚Äôs popular DJs at the time. The following year, in 1986, Off broke ground with their new record, ‚ÄúElectrica Salsa‚Äù from their debut album, Organisation For Fun. The track became such a hit across Europe that Sven found himself as a pop sensation performing with stars such as Vanessa Paradis and Axel Bauer at the age of 22. It sold one million copies. Off released a series of singles and a second album, Ask Yourself, in 1989. Their final single, \\"Move Your Body\\" was released in 1990. M√ºnzing and Anziloti moved on to their new project, Snap!. Omen At the age of 24 in 1988, V√§th opened the dance club ‚ÄúOmen‚Äù in Frankfurt with Michael M√ºnzing and Mattias Martinsohn. Previously, it was open under the name ‚ÄúVogue‚Äù and V√§th had been its resident there as well for a stint. The new club became one of the best clubs in Germany, as voted by Groove Magazine and is considered to be one of the birthplaces of techno in Germany. A short German film of twelve minutes documents how the club prepares for another night with scenes of people on the dance floor interviewed for their thoughts on Omen. Ten years later with a heavy heart, Sven decided to close the club in 1998. The closure came in part due to problems faced with landlords and city authorities. At its last party, there were so many partygoers that speakers were set up outside and people danced in the street. Police did not intervene the party except to block car traffic. Eye Q & Harthouse Records Mayday 2009 dortmund halle 1 Eye Q was started in 1991 with V√§th, Heinz Roth, and Matthias Hoffman, which released of two of V√§th‚Äôs best-known albums: Accident in Paradise (1992) (which Mixmag named one of the 50 best dance albums of all time) and The Harlequin, the Robot, and the Ballet-Dancer (1994). In 1992, Sven also started the label Harthouse Records, on which he recorded under the alias Barbarella. Separation from the two labels came in 1997, when Sven moved on to work on other projects. In 1998, the two labels declared bankruptcy. Virgin Sven V√§th signed a 3-album contract with major record label Virgin Records in 1998. He released Fusion (1998), Contact (2000), and Fire (2002). With the Fusion album, V√§th toured worldwide his sound of techno, electro, and trip hop. The album was also remixed by various artists and released in a special six-record vinyl edition. Virgin also released a compilation in 2000 of some of V√§th‚Äôs best work at Eye Q Records. Cocoon Cocoon began in 1996 as a series of parties that Sven would pour his savings into. The name came about after Sven saw La Fura dels Baus in 1994 in Berlin at the Tempodrom. The show featured props of hanging cocoons filled with water, which ultimately inspired the name for his next project representing metamorphosis and change. He toured with the concept throughout and Germany and even North America. Although the parties strained him monetarily and were not entirely successful, V√§th decided to reopen the project in 1999, this time by starting off with a booking agency. After the agency was established, the rest followed ‚Äì events and then the record label. The booking agency, established with the help of Talida Wagner, has sported many famous names amongst its roster such as Ricardo Villalobos, Matt John, Dubfire and Sven V√§th himself. Today it continues to provide bookings for artists such as Tobi Neumann, Onur √ñzer, Raresh, and many others. Cocoon Recordings has been the launchpad for many of today‚Äôs famous DJs‚Äô careers. Artists such as Martin Buttrich, Loco Dice, Roman Fl√ºgel, and Guy Gerber have all released tracks on Cocoon. Each year the record label releases a compilation named by a letter of the alphabet (i.e. Cocoon Compilation A) in order to showcase signed artist work. The goal of the label was to enable aspiring producers to have a platform to release their music on without having to refer to a major label. In 2013 the label celebrated its 100th release. Cocoon Ibiza Sven V√§th playing his Cocoon party in Ibiza at Amnesia club, September 2013 In the 1999 summer season in Ibiza, Mar T of Amnesia (nightclub) offered Sven to throw his Cocoon parties on the one day that Amnesia was closed ‚Äì Mondays. After a trial period of four parties, Cocoon parties continued for fourteen Mondays in 2000 and for the next thirteen years. The night has featured a spectacular array of the world‚Äôs best DJs in electronic music, with artists such as Cassy, Carl Craig, Josh Wink, Adam Beyer, and Ricardo Villalobos manning the decks. After each season, V√§th releases a mix called ‚ÄúThe Sound of the Season.‚Äù V√§th‚Äôs Monday parties at Amnesia fostered the underground sound of Ibiza at a time when trance and commercial music started dominating the island. Each year, Cocoon‚Äôs Ibiza team works on a new theme to create an exciting and different atmosphere for each season. Johannes Goller, long time friend of Sven‚Äôs, has led the team since the beginning in producing each successful season. Cocoon is also famous for throwing after-parties in various locations throughout Ibiza and Formentera that were often illegal, and sometimes closed down by the police. The Cocoon parties also cultivated ‚ÄúCocoon Heroes‚Äù (the theme for the 12th season) such as Richie Hawtin, Loco Dice, Dubfire, and Cassy alongside Sven, all of them gathering on Mondays to play long sets in the terrace and main room of the club. Cocoon Mondays at Amnesia continued strong until 2018. In 2018 Cocoon was moved to Pacha. Cocoon Frankfurt In 2004, V√§th opened the club ‚ÄúCocoon‚Äù in Frankfurt. Considered the successor for Sven‚Äôs endeavor at Omen, Cocoon club was also very popular. Techno, house, and trance acts were known to play there, some of the better-known being Richie Hawtin, Ricardo Villalobos, Armin van Buuren, and Above & Beyond. Some of the resident DJs included V√§th himself, DJ Karotte, Toni Rios, C-Rock, and Sidney Spaeth. The building contained two restaurants run by a celebrity chef, lounges, and interesting architecture featuring ‚Äúcocoon‚Äù niches for people to hang out in. In November 2012, Sven closed down Cocoon club due to bankruptcy. Personal life Family Sven V√§th has two children. He has a daughter who was born in 1989. Then in 1991, he met Nina Peter, a Viennese leather fashion accessories designer, during a private party in his own home in Ibiza. They married in Thailand with a Buddhist ceremony in 2008, and three years later, their son Tiga was born in Vienna on July 26, 2011. V√§th is good friends with the renowned Canadian DJ/producer Tiga and named his son after him. In 2012, V√§th and Peter separated. Sven has two brothers, one of whom is an art director and DJ, and the other a flower shop owner. Living V√§th spent his childhood near Frankfurt. As he grew older, he would spend his summers in Ibiza and the rest of the year in Frankfurt, in between world tours. Now, V√§th has a home in Ibiza, where he tends to spend six to eight months of the year, including the summer season for his Cocoon parties at Amnesia. In 2013, he decided to move to London to re-experience its culture, art, and parties. After many years of DJing and partying, V√§th believes in taking care of the mind and body. He learned discipline from Ayurveda, which he picked up when he lived in Goa where he met an Ayurvedic. As the constant long nights and traveling can be quite tiring, V√§th tries to live as healthy as possible. From October to January (off season) he strictly follows a regimen of Ayurvedic eating with no meats, sugars or alcohols. When his daughter was born, he ceased his use of cocaine and a few years later quit smoking as well. Vinyl A staunch supporter of vinyl, V√§th will only play music that has been released on vinyl in his sets. He mentions in the IMS 2013 interview, ‚ÄúI like to go to the record store and talk to people‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just enjoying it so much.‚Äù He often mentions as well that his most treasured belongings are his records. He says \\"a well-manufactured record, played with a good pick-up system on a good pre-amp/mixing console simply sounds better than any of its digital competitors. Vinyl is THE medium for everybody who sets high values on good sound.\\" He is one of the few top 30 DJs, according to Resident Advisor, to continue to use just turntables and mixers when they DJ, which he describes as his \\"instruments\\". When he heard that Technics were discontinuing manufacture of their renowned SL-1200 turntables he likened it to a pianist being told there would be no more grand pianos made.

Three singles were released from it, \\"Barely Breathing\\", \\"She Runs Away\\" and \\"Reasons for Living\\". The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on August 27, 1997, denoting sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States. Recording Sheik recorded around thirty songs for this album with the producer Rupert Hine while working out a deal with Atlantic (who took over his previous contract from Immortal Records), which left around 18 tracks unheard from these sessions. The only outtake from the album which saw the light, \\"View from the Other Side\\", was released as a B-side in 1997. Critical reception Kelly McCartney of AllMusic said the album is more than just the single \\"Barely Breathing\\", praising Sheik's songwriting for being \\"richly melodic and thoughtful\\" and Hine's production for giving the stories life throughout the track listing and multiple emotions that can be interpreted by the listeners, concluding that there is \\"something for everybody and a great record all around\\". James Hunter from Rolling Stone noted how Sheik's musicianship emulated UK acts like Talk Talk and The Smiths, concluding, \\"He may be enamored of antique pop, but Sheik is never merely retro. This [album] is a defiant debut ‚Äì beautiful and benevolent of spirit.\\" The Entertainment Weekly writer Steven Mirkin felt that Sheik's vocal performance was too restraint to allow for any \\"real emotional commitment\\" for the listeners to get out of the generic lyrics. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau dismissed Sheik as a second-rate \\"matinee idol\\" and \\"a whiner stupid enough to fall for the depressed wacko\\" and \\"stupid enough to blame it entirely on her\\", in reference to \\"Barely Breathing\\". Release The album was met with commercial success and was Gold-certified. It includes the Grammy-nominated hit single \\"Barely Breathing\\", which stayed on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for a record-breaking 55 (consecutive) weeks.

Stryker (October 30, 1924 ‚Äì March 24, 1945) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of the U.S. military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions in World War II. The Stryker combat vehicle is partially named after Stryker. Biography Born on October 30, 1924, in Portland, Oregon, Stryker enlisted in the Army in that city in July 1943.WWII Army Enlistment Records He served in Europe and became a private first class in Company E of the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 17th Airborne Division. During Operation Varsity on March 24, 1945, Stryker's company attacked a strongly defended building near Wesel, Germany. When a platoon tasked with making a frontal assault became pinned down by intense fire, Stryker voluntarily ran to the head of the unit, called for the soldiers to follow him, and charged the German position. He was killed by hostile fire from the building. His attack provided a diversion which allowed other elements of Company E to take the position, capturing over 200 soldiers and freeing three American airmen held as prisoners by the Germans. For these actions, Stryker was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor nine months later, on December 11, 1945. He was one of three people to earn the medal during Operation Varsity, the others being Private First Class George J. Peters and Technical Sergeant Clinton Hedrick. Aged 20 at his death, Stryker was buried at Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno, California.

The park is located in the Saint Paul Mountain Range on the western coast of the island of Palawan, about north of the city centre of Puerto Princesa, and contains the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River. It has been managed by the City Government of Puerto Princesa since 1992. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999, and voted as a New7Wonders of Nature in 2012. It also became a Ramsar Wetland Site in 2012.  Description  The Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park is a protected area of the Philippines located about north of the city centre of Puerto Princesa, Palawan. The river is also called 'Puerto Princesa Underground River'. The national park is located in the Saint Paul Mountain Range on the western coast of the island. It is bordered by St. Paul Bay to the north and the Babuyan River to the east. The City Government of Puerto Princesa has managed the National Park since 1992. The entrance to the subterranean river is a short hike or boat ride from the town Sabang.  Recent history  In 2010, a group of environmentalists and geologists discovered that the underground river has a second floor, which means that there are small waterfalls inside the cave. They also found a cave dome measuring above the underground river, rock formations, large bats, a deep water hole in the river, more river channels, and another deep cave, as well as marine creatures and more. Deeper areas of the underground river are almost impossible to explore due to oxygen deprivation. On November 11, 2011, Puerto Princesa Underground River was provisionally chosen as one of the New7Wonders of Nature. This selection was officially confirmed on January 28, 2012.  Geography  Rock formations at the national park The park has a limestone karst mountain landscape. St. Pauls Underground River Cave is more than long and contains an underground section of the Cabayugan River. The river winds through the cave before flowing directly into the West Philippine Sea and is navigable by boat up to from the sea. The cave includes major formations of stalactites and stalagmites, and several large chambers, including the Italian's Chamber with approximate 2.5 million square meters volume. It is one of the largest cave rooms in the world. The lower portion of the river up to from the sea, is subject to tidal influences. Until the 2007 discovery of an underground river in Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula, the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River was reputed to be the world's longest underground river. The area also represents a habitat for biodiversity conservation. The site contains a full mountain-to-the-sea ecosystem and has some of the most important forests in Asia. It was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site on December 4, 1999.  Flora  Flora at the national park The park has a range of forest formations representing eight of the thirteen forest types found in tropical Asia, namely forest over ultramafic soils, forest over limestone soils, montane forest, freshwater swamp forest, lowland evergreen tropical rainforest, riverine forest, beach forest, and mangrove forest. Researchers have identified more than 800 plant species from 300 genera and 100 families. These include at least 295 trees dominated by the dipterocarp species. In the lowland forest, large trees including the dao (Dracontomelon dao), ipil (Intsia bijuga), dita (Alstonia scholaris), amugis (Koordersiodendron pinnatum), and apitong (Dipterocarpus gracilis) are common. Beach forest species include bitaog (Calophyllum inophyllum), Pongamia pinnata, and Erynthia orientalis. Other plant species include almaciga (Agathis philippinensis), kamagong (Diospyros pulganensis) pandan (Pandanus sp.) anibong, and rattan (Calamus sp.).  Fauna  Bats hanging on the cave Birds comprise the largest group of vertebrates found in the park. Of the 252 bird species known to occur in Palawan, a total of 165 species of birds were recorded in the park. This represents 67% of the total birds and all of the 15 endemic bird species of Palawan. Notable species seen in the park are the blue-naped parrot (Tanygnathus lucionensis), Tabon scrub fowl (Megapodius cumunigii), hill myna (Gracula religiosa), Palawan hornbill (Anthracoceros marchei), white breasted sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster). There are also some 30 mammal species that have been recorded.Madulid, 1998 Most often observed in the forest canopy and along the shoreline feeding during low tide is the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis), the only primate found in the area. Other mammal species in the park are the Palawan bearded pig (Sus ahoenobarbus), bearcat (Arctictis binturong), Palawan stink badger (Mydaus marchei) and the Palawan porcupine (Hystrix pumila). 19 species of reptiles have been identified, eight of which are endemic. Common species in the area include large predators like the common reticulated python (Python reticulates, the monitor lizard (Varanus salvator) and the green crested lizard (Bronchocoela cristatella). Amphibian fauna include ten species. The Philippine woodland frog (Rana acanthi) is the most dominant and frequently encountered. One species, Barbourula busuangensis, endemic to Palawan was also observed in the area. Nine species of bat, two species of swiftlet and whip spider (Stygophrynus sp.) are found in the cave, and the sea cow (Dugong dugon) and the hawksbill sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) feed in the coastal area of the park.  International reception  Puerto Princesa Underground River was entered as the Philippine entry ‚Äì and topped the first round of voting ‚Äì in the New7Wonders of Nature competition. On July 29, 2011, after the second round of voting, it was declared 1 of 28 finalists. Mayor Edward S. Hagedorn extended his gratitude to all those who supported and voted for the PPUR. On November 11, 2011 it was provisionally chosen as one of the New7Wonders, together with the Amazon rainforest, Halong Bay, Iguazu Falls, Jeju Island, Komodo Island, and Table Mountain.Voting procedure for the New7Wonders of Nature at vote7.com On January 28, 2012, Malaca√±ang expressed elation on Saturday over the official inclusion of the Puerto Princesa Underground River (PPUR) in the world‚Äôs New Seven Wonders of Nature. \\"Confirmation that the Puerto Princesa Underground River is one of the New Seven Wonders of Nature is welcome news indeed. Throughout the competition, Filipinos from all walks of life have given time, energy, and resources to this campaign,\\" Presidential Spokesperson Edwin Lacierda said. Department of Tourism spokesman and Assistant Secretary Benito Bengzon Jr. said the underground estuary made it into the world‚Äôs New Seven Wonders of Nature after the validation process conducted by the New7Wonders Foundation last year. The voting was criticized, especially the Philippine voting. Nothing in the New7Wonders voting procedure prohibited repetitive voting, making the results subject to government and tourism industry campaigns to vote often for local sites with the financial incentive of increased tourism. Philippine President Benigno Simeon Aquino III, in his speech during the official proclamation launch of the Puerto Princesa Underground River as one of the 28 finalists, urged the country's 80 million cellphone subscribers to vote PPUR via text.\\"We send two billion text messages a day, all we need is one billion text votes for the Puerto Princesa Underground River so (we can accomplish) that in half a day,\\" the President said. \\"I urge everyone to vote to the maximum for the Puerto Princesa Underground River as one of the New Seven Wonders of Nature\\" he reiterated. \\"Aquino leads online voting for Puerto Princesa underground river\\", gmanews.tv On 30 June 2019, Puerto Princesa underground river was celebrated with a Google Doodle.

He was a charter inductee into both the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. A native of Mansfield, Ohio, Henry attended Washington & Jefferson College where he played at the tackle position from 1915 to 1919. He was selected as a consensus All-American in 1918 and again in 1919. He next played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) for the Canton Bulldogs (1920‚Äì1923, 1925‚Äì1926), New York Giants (1927), and Pottsville Maroons (1927‚Äì1928). He helped lead Canton to consecutive NFL championships in 1922 and 1923 and was selected as a first-team All-Pro four consecutive years from 1920 to 1923. He also served as head coach with Canton in 1926 and with Pottsville in 1928. In 1929, Henry returned to Washington & Jefferson as an assistant football coach. He became athletic director in 1932 and held that position until his death in 1952. He was also the head coach of the Washington & Jefferson football team in 1942 and 1945. Early life Henry was born in 1897 in Mansfield, Ohio. He was the only child of Ulysses Sherman Henry (1865-1938), an Ohio native who worked for 32 years as a guard in a reformatory, and Bertha Frank Henry, an immigrant from Germany.1910 U.S. Census entry for Ulyses S. Henry and family. Son Wilbur F., age 12, born in Ohio. Census Place: Mansfield Ward 3, Richland, Ohio; Roll: T624_1225; Page: 7A; Enumeration District: 0184; FHL microfilm: 1375238. Source Information: Ancestry.com. 1910 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Henry attended Mansfield Senior High School where he played football both as a lineman and fullback from 1911 to 1914. As the team captain and starting fullback in 1914, Henry was effective as a lead blocker and passer out of a single-wing offense and led the team to an 8-1 record. That year, he also returned a fumble 50 yards for a touchdown and scored three touchdowns in one game. College In 1915, Henry enrolled at Washington & Jefferson College located approximately 30 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. He played football for the Washington & Jefferson Presidents football team for five years from 1915 to 1919 (the 1918 season was not counted against Henry's four years of eligibility due to his military service). During Henry's time with Washington & Jefferson, the football team compiled a 31‚Äì10‚Äì1 record. Washington & Jefferson head coach Bob Folwell switched Henry in 1915 from a fullback to a tackle, the position he played for his entire college and professional career. The 1915 Washington & Jefferson football team compiled an 8‚Äì1‚Äì1 record, defeated Yale (which had won the national championship as recently as 1909) by a 17‚Äì0 score, and outscored all opponents, 219 to 45. Henry became known as one of the best punt blockers in the game while playing for Washington & Jefferson. Years later, he cited a blocked punt in 1916 as his greatest thrill as a player. Taking the ball off the punter's toe and running it back 40 yards for a touchdown, Henry recalled: \\"The ball plopped right against my stomach and never bounced as I threw my arms around it.\\" Henry was recognized by the Frank Menke Syndicate as a first-term All-American at tackle in 1917.Spalding's Football Guide In both 1918 and 1919, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American. In 1919, Pitt argued that Henry was ineligible to play a fifth year. A gentleman's agreement among all college teams generally allowed players whose 1918 seasons were cut short to play. In fact, Pitt played several other teams with similarly situated players without complaint. Henry agreed to sit out the game, and Pitt won, 7‚Äì6. Washington & Jefferson fans circulated flyers at the game that said, \\"Who Scared Pitt?\\" on the front with a mug shot and one word, \\"Henry\\", on the back. In his later years, Henry was not one to keep souvenirs, but he did keep the program from that game. In 1920, Pop Warner, who had coached against Henry at Pitt, selected Henry as one of the two tackles on his greatest collegiate eleven of all time and said: \\"Henry was the fastest and most aggressive big man I ever saw.\\" Henry also played basketball for W&J; and competed in weights events for the Washington & Jefferson track team. He also later played professional basketball for the Warren Trumbull Steels, Canton Sinclair Oils, and Dover All-Stars. Professional football Henry's small charm made from anthracite coal given to members of the 1928 Pottsville Maroons Canton Bulldogs (1920‚Äì1923) Upon graduating from college in 1920, Henry was 5 feet, 11 inches and weighed 235 pounds, but was \\"considered a fast man, able to do the hundred in close to 11 seconds.\\" He received offers to play professional football for the Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Tigers, Akron Pros, Hammond Pros, and Rock Island Independents. He signed with Canton in September 1920, saying he wished to play with Jim Thorpe. As a rookie, Henry participated in the first season of the new professional association that became the NFL. He played all 13 games for the 1920 Bulldogs team that compiled a 7‚Äì4‚Äì2 record. At the end of the 1920 season, Henry was selected as a first-team tackle on the All-Pro team selected by sportswriters Bruce Copeland (Rock Island Argus). In 1921, Henry again played every game for the Bulldogs team that compiled an 8‚Äì3‚Äì3 record. Henry was selected as a first-team All-Pro team compiled by the Buffalo Evening News. In 1922, Guy Chamberlin joined the Canton team as player, coach, and part owner and built the Bulldogs into one of the NFL's first powerhouse teams. The 1922 Bulldogs team included Pro Football Hall of Famers (Henry, Chamberlin, and Link Lyman), compiled a 10‚Äì0‚Äì2 record, shut out nine of twelve opponents, outscored all opponents 184 to 15, and won the 1922 NFL championship. The following year, the 1923 Canton Bulldogs with Henry and Chamberlin compiled another undefeated season (11‚Äì0‚Äì1), shut out eight of twelve opponents, outscored all opponents by a combined total of 246 to 19, and won its second consecutive NFL championship. Henry led the 1923 team with 58 points on nine field goals, 25 extra points, and a touchdown reception. On October 23, 1923, he set an NFL record with a 94-yard punt; his record stood until 1969. On November 11, 1923, with the Bulldogs trailing to Buffalo by a 3‚Äì0 score and a half minute left in the game, Henry blocked a Tommy Hughitt punt and then drop-kicked a field goal to preserve Canton's undefeated season. At the end of the 1923 season, Henry was selected by Collyer's Eye magazine, the Green Bay Press-Gazette, and the Canton Daily News as a first-team player on the 1923 All-Pro Team. Pottsville Maroons (1924) In August 1924, Cleveland jeweler Samuel Deutsch bought the Canton Bulldogs and moved the team to Cleveland where they became the Cleveland Bulldogs during the 1924 NFL season. Henry did not join the Bulldogs in Cleveland, instead playing for the 1924 Pottsville Maroons of the Anthracite League. (Pottsville in the 1920s was a city with a population of approximately 22,000 located 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia.) Henry led Pottsville to a 12‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and the Anthracite League championship and was named to the All-Anthracite team at the end of the 1924 season. Canton Bulldogs (1925‚Äì1926) In January 1925, Henry was reinstated to good standing with the NFL, having been subjected to sanctions the previous year when he refused to join the Bulldogs when the team moved to Cleveland. In the summer of 1925, Henry and four other Canton alumni (Link Lyman, Rudy Comstock, Ben Jones, and Harry Robb) bought the Cleveland Bulldogs for $3,500 and moved the team back to Canton.Old Leather, p. 59. Henry appeared in only six games for the 1925 Canton team, missing much of the season due to injury. The following year, he appeared in all 13 games and served as co-head coach with Harry Robb of the 1926 Canton team that compiled a 1‚Äì9‚Äì3 record. New York and Pottsville (1927‚Äì1928) Before the 1927 season, the NFL dropped 12 teams, including Canton. In September 1927, Henry signed to play with the New York Giants. He appeared in only four games for the Giants. In mid-October 1927, he was acquired by the Pottsville Maroons (for whom he had played in 1924) in a transaction with the Giants. He remained with Pottsville through the 1928 season. He also served as head coach of the 1928 Pottsville team that compiled a 2‚Äì8 record against NFL opponents. Honors and awards Henry received multiple honors and awards arising out of his accomplishments as a football player, including the following: * In November 1928, John Heisman selected Henry for \\"Heisman's Hundred in Hall of Football Fame\\". Heisman cited Henry's \\"extraordinary\\" speed and called Henry \\"[b]eyond all question . . . the greatest punt blocker the game has ever known.\\" * In November 1931, a jury consisting of many of football's leading figures, including Pop Warner, Robert Zuppke, Gil Dobie, Hugo Bezdek, and Bill Roper, was tasked with selecting \\"Football's Greatest Player.\\" Henry finished 16th in the voting. * In November 1939, Grantland Rice included Henry as one of two tackles and eleven players on the All-Time All-America team he selected for Collier's magazine. * In October 1951, Henry was inducted into the Helms Athletic Foundation's Professional Football Hall of Fame. He had previously been inducted into the Helms College Football Hall of Fame in 1949 and was the eighth player to be inducted into both the pro and college football hall of fame established by the Helms Foundation. * In November 1951, Henry was one of 52 inaugural inductees into the National Football Foundation's Football Hall of Fame (later renamed the College Football Hall of Fame). * In January 1963, Henry was selected as one of the 17 inaugural inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. * In August 1969, Henry was named to the NFL 1920s All-Decade Team. * In February 1971, Washington & Jefferson College dedicated its new multipurpose sports complex as the Henry Physical Education Center (later renamed Henry Memorial Center) in his honor. Coaching and administrative career In June 1929, Henry was hired by his alma mater W&J; as an advisory coach to the football team and head coach of the basketball and track teams. In the fall of 1929, Henry also coached W&J;'s freshman football team. He was promoted in July 1930 to assistant coach for W&J;'s varsity football team. Henry became the school's athletic director in April 1932 while retaining his duties as line coach for the football team. When Stu Holcomb resigned as W&J;'s head football coach in early 1942, Henry added the responsibility to his duties as athletic director. W&J; President Ralph Cooper Hutchinson said at the time: \\"At this time, when football, along with other college activities, faces a crisis due to war conditions, the college has turned to Director Henry to serve in the emergency.\\" W&J; withdrew from intercollegiate for the 1943 and 1944 seasons due to wartime conditions. When football resumed in 1945, Henry again served as the team's head coach. In January 1946, Henry stepped down as head coach with the hiring of Henry Leucht to take over those responsibilities. Henry continued to serve as W&J;'s athletic director until his death in 1952. Family and death Henry was married in September 1927 to Marie M. Floding of Canton, Ohio. He met his wife after he was hospitalized with a football injury, and she was assigned as his nurse. In his later years, Henry developed diabetes which limited his circulation. In January 1949, he had his right leg amputated to treat a gangrenous infection that developed in a toe. He died in 1952 at age 54 at his home in Washington, Pennsylvania. The cause of death was sepsis due to gangrene in his left foot and diabetes mellitus.Death certificate for Wilbur Frank Henry, dated February 9, 1952.

It extends from just north of the northeast corner of the city of Buffalo in a roughly northeast direction almost straight to just south of the north county line. The road is named Millersport Highway north of Eggert Road in Amherst for the community at its northern terminus. The section between its southern terminus at U.S. Route 62 (US 62) and the Eggert Road intersection is named Grover Cleveland Highway. While the construction of Interstate 990 (I-990) has diminished NY 263's importance as the major route for traffic from Buffalo to Lockport, traffic must continue on NY 263 past the northern terminus of I-990 to complete the trip to Lockport. Route description The south end of NY 263 is at Bailey Avenue (US 62), a short distance north of the Buffalo city line in Amherst. Like US 62, NY 263 in this area is a busy shopping strip for Eggertsville, the surrounding suburban neighborhood. This section is called the Grover Cleveland Highway after former Buffalo mayor, New York governor and US President Grover Cleveland. It soon crosses two of the northern Buffalo area's important arteries, Sheridan Drive (NY 324) and the Youngmann Expressway (I-290). NY 263 northbound after NY 324 in Amherst The stores that have been almost continuously lining the road abate shortly after the interstate when it makes its only deviation from its straight course, curving around the north campus of SUNY Buffalo, where it was relocated in the early 1970s. Past the campus and a nearby office park, the road narrows to two lanes in the small suburban hamlet of Getzville, where NY 270 heads due north as Campbell Boulevard. North of Getzville the road continues straight through the much less developed, and more wooded, lands of East Amherst. After several miles, I-990 reaches its current end when both roadways terminate at the west side of the highway. NY 263's reaches its northern terminus at Transit Road (NY 78) approximately a half mile south of the county line of Niagara County in an area called Millersport, which straddles the county line and gives the entire highway its name. History The junction of NY 270 and NY 263 in Amherst, shown here, was NY 263's original southern terminus. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the portion of what is now NY 263 south of Getzville was designated as part of NY 270. NY 263 was assigned by the following year; however, it initially followed a significantly different alignment than it does today. At the time, the route extended from NY 270 south of Getzville to NY 93 northwest of Akron by way of Millersport. West of Millersport, NY 263 utilized a short portion of its current alignment before taking a more northerly path along Hopkins Road and Tonawanda Creek Road. At Millersport, the route overlapped with NY 78 south to Wolcott Road, from where it continued northeast through Clarence on Wolcott and Goodrich Roads. The former alignment of NY 263 through the University of Buffalo campus in Amherst, with an old reference marker on the right-hand side At the north end of Goodrich Road, located on the southern bank of Tonawanda Creek, NY 263 curved to the east, following Tonawanda Creek Road once again to Salt Road. Here, NY 263 veered southward, continuing on Salt Road to Hunts Corners‚ÄìAkron Road. At this junction, it turned one final time to follow Hunts Corners‚ÄìAkron Road east to NY 93 near Akron. NY 263 was realigned to use Tonawanda Creek Road between NY 78 and Goodrich Road. It was altered again by the following year to continue south along Salt Road from Hunts Corners‚ÄìAkron Road to NY 5 in the hamlet of Clarence. Around the same time, NY 263 was realigned onto a newly constructed extension of Millersport Highway between Hopkins Road and Millersport. NY 263 was realigned to overlap with NY 78 north to NY 31 in Lockport. Its former alignment east of NY 78 became a realignment of NY 268. In the early 1940s, NY 263 was extended southwest to Buffalo over NY 270. Initially, NY 263 overlapped with NY 270 along Millersport Highway; however, the overlap was eliminated in the late 1940s after NY 270 was truncated to begin at NY 263 in Getzville. NY 263 was cut back to its current northern terminus in Millersport on January 1, 1962. The route was re-extended to Clarence , replacing NY 268; however, the extension was short-lived as NY 263 was pulled back to its junction with NY 78 by 1977.

By tradition, the Tewa people moved here from the north, perhaps from the San Luis Valley of southern Colorado, part of a great migration spanning into the Pueblo IV Era. Spanish colonial capital In March 1598, conquistador O√±ate traveled from north central M√©xico, accompanied by a caravan of Catholic missionaries, a thousand soldiers, colonists, and Tlaxcalan Mexican Indians. The expedition included cattle, sheep, goats, oxen and horses, and arrived at Yungeh ‚ÄîPlace of the Mockingbird‚Äîin present-day Ohkay Owingeh on July 11, 1598. The people who met him that day, it is written, were hospitable and offered Yuque Yunque pueblo as guest quarters to O√±ate and his party. On July 12, 1598, he baptized and renamed Caypa pueblo (present-day Ohkay Owingeh) San Juan de los Caballeros, after his patron saint John the Baptist. San Juan de los Caballeros became the first capital of the New Spain colony of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©jico. In local history, it is said the event united the two fragmented families of Caypa and Yuque Yunque. Since their arrival from earlier homelands in the northwest, the two pueblos had been divided by the river, split until the expedition party's arrival. When the community offered Yuque Yunque pueblo on the west bank to O√±ate, the two fragmented pueblos were made whole again at Caypa. The Spanish capital would be moved in 1610 to La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de As√≠s. Pop√© was a local man who rose to be one of the most regarded leaders of American Indian history. He would play a major role in the Pueblo revolt in 1680. The community was also formally known as the San Juan Indian Reservation.  Present day  Ohkay Owingeh is the headquarters of the Eight Northern Indian Pueblos Council, and the pueblo people are from the Tewa ethnic group of American Indians. It is one of the largest Tewa- speaking pueblos. \\"Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo\\". New Mexico, Land of Enchantment. New Mexico Tourism Department. Retrieved March 15, 2014. The annual Pueblo Feast Day is June 24. For all pueblos, the actual feast day includes a Catholic mass that is held in the morning. Because of historical relations with the Catholic Church, all pueblos have a church located near the center of the village. Most Pueblo people practice aspects of both the Catholic religion and Pueblo belief systems. The tribe owns the Ohkay Casino and the Oke-Oweenge Crafts Cooperative, which showcases redware pottery, weaving, painting, and other artwork from the eight northern pueblos.

It was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from 1981 to 1985, and collected into 18 tank≈çbon by Shueisha. The story follows the adventures of the three Kisugi sisters ‚Äî Hitomi, Rui and Ai, who are formidable art thieves trying to collect all the works belonging to their missing father. The manga was made into a televised anime series originally broadcast in 1983 to 1984 on Nippon TV, with a second season ending in 1985. It has also received two live-action adaptations; a TV movie in 1988 and a theatrical film in 1997. Cat's Eye is one of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jumps best-selling manga series of all time, with over 18 million copies sold. The anime has also aired in a number of countries outside Japan, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Philippines, and China. In 2007, ImaginAsian broadcast the first season of the first anime on ImaginAsian TV, and then gave the first half of the series its first North American home video release.

It was serialized until January 25, 2014, which comprises eight tank≈çbon volumes. Plot Hitomi Kisugi, along with her older sister Rui and her younger sister Ai, run a caf√© called \\"Cat's Eye\\" in Tokyo. The sisters lead a double life as a trio of highly skilled art thieves, stealing works of art which primarily belonged to their long-missing father, Michael Heinz, who was a famous art collector during the Nazi regime. Hitomi's fianc√© is Toshio Utsumi, a clumsy young police officer who is investigating the Cat's Eye case. Despite being a frequent visitor to the caf√© he is unaware of the double life of the girls. Hitomi regularly informs the police in advance about her next job using a signature \\"Cat's Eye\\" calling card, and then uses Toshio's research about the security surrounding the target to help plan the job. At the end of the series, Heinz leaves a note for his daughters stating that he cannot reveal himself yet because the mafia may kill him, but he may appear in five years' time. However, the \\"Heinz\\" turns out to be the sisters' treacherous uncle Cranaff, who betrayed Michael years earlier. After losing a final bet to the Cat's Eye, Cranaff decides to atone for his sin by setting fire to the museum, killing himself. Hitomi eventually admits to Toshio that she is part of Cat's Eye and flees before he can arrest her. Toshio vows to track her down, attempting to \\"arrest\\" Hitomi at the airport with a wedding ring. He resigns from the police force and travels to America to find Hitomi, but finds that she has lost her memory due to viral meningitis. Toshio spends time with her until her memories come back, and the two rekindle their relationship. Characters ; : https://www.soundcadencestudios.com/city-hunter-shinjuku- private-eyes.html :Hitomi is the main protagonist of the series. Second daughter of Michael Heinz, Hitomi is usually the one who actually commits the heists, and is hence uniquely referred to as the Cat's Eye. Like Rui, she is an accomplished athlete and well versed in a number of disciplines and skills ranging from horseback riding to safe cracking. She is a skilled gymnast and is able to perform complex acrobatic moves with ease and grace. She is able to escape most restraints and handcuffs with minimal effort, and it is inferred that she is ambidextrous as well as double jointed. She is a skilled martial artist with proficiency in a number of disciplines, most notably judo, boxing and karate, and also has degrees in kendo and aikido. Hitomi is very charming, clever, sweet, sisterly, loyal, cunning, flirtatious, caring and kind-hearted. :Like Rui, Hitomi is also able to disguise her appearance effortlessly and can speak several other languages. ; : https://www.soundcadencestudios.com/city- hunter-shinjuku-private-eyes.html :Rui is the second protagonist of the series. Hitomi's elegant and fashionable older sister, Rui is the leader and brain of the ‚ÄúCat's Eye‚Äù group and the one who usually outlines strategies and plans the heists. With model good looks, worldly sophistication, and a razor- sharp intelligence she is able to handle almost any situation. She is extremely athletic and proficient in a great number of activities and skills including car racing, hang gliding, parachuting, helicopter piloting, motorcycle riding, roller skating, skateboarding, martial arts, electronics, handguns and scuba diving. She is a skilled actress and is able to disguise her appearance effortlessly. She is also fluent in a number of languages including English, French and German; she can also read lips accurately. :Rui acts as the mother figure for her sisters and is very protective of them. She is the only sister who has any lasting memory of their parents. ; : https://www.soundcadencestudios.com/city-hunter-shinjuku-private-eyes.html :Ai is the third protagonist of the series. As baby sister of the trio, Ai has a spunky, tomboyish personality and demeanor, and has a genius-level I.Q. and is particularly adept in mechanics, computer programming and engineering. She has built a wide array of gadgets to help her sisters in their heists. A typical teenager, she seems to be preoccupied a lot and dreams of falling in love. Being a high school girl, she also has a pet tabby kitten called \\"Tiger\\". :While not as skilled as her sisters, Ai has none-the-less mastered a number of skills and is regularly the one who operates the get-away vehicles for the heists, including helicopters, gyrocopters, trucks, motorcycles, cars and mini-planes. Her greatest weakness lies in the fact she is physically the weakest of the three siblings (evident in the anime when she tried to suplex a wrestler, only to have the maneuver backfire on her), but in exchange, she is also the most agile. ; : :The male protagonist of the series, Toshio is the Hitomi's high school sweetheart. Toshio always dreamed of being a police detective even when in high school, and upon graduation from Academy was assigned to the District Police Station in the heart of Tokyo. While Toshio has wanted to marry Hitomi, he has vowed not to until he has captured the Cat's Eye (he has, however, made the first step and proposed to her). :While a bit clumsy, very gullible, unlucky and not very good at finding clues, his dogged determination and unyielding persistence has impressed his supervisors. He is, however, very stubborn and gets into verbal fights with his Chief constantly. Toshio doesn't carry a gun and prefers to use his wits and fists to contend with criminals. He has a weakness for beautiful women (especially blondes) and constantly makes Hitomi jealous. ; : :Toshio's demanding Section Chief, who oversees the Detective's Division of the Inunaki Precinct. Nothing really is known about him, even his full name is never disclosed. He is constantly at odds with Toshio over his handling of the Cat's Eye investigation, and scolds Toshio at every opportunity. ; : :A special investigator sent in from Tokyo Police HQ to assist in the Cat's Eye investigations. Asatani has a very shrewd intellect and has a very cunning personality, and is considered an elite officer of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. She is an expert markswoman (won the All-Japan Air Pistol Championships) and is proficient in several martial art forms, she's a 4th- degree black belt in karate and 2nd degree black belt in judo, making her more than a match for Hitomi. She is also quite a beauty, even being crowned a beauty queen during one of the Cat's Eye cases. She is one of the first person to suspect Hitomi as the true identity of Cat's Eye, but is never able to find definitive proof. Her main weakness is that she must wear prescription glasses all the time, as she is practically blind without them. :While never really elaborated in the TV series, in the manga she is said to have a secret crush on Toshio, much to the chagrin of Hitomi. ; :An artistic wunderkind in Germany during the 1930s, Heinz was so gifted that by age 10 he already began composing the beginnings of his impressive art collection, which contains not only elaborate paintings and lithographs but also one-of-a-kind jewelry, sculptures and metal works. Heinz's was even able to create exquisite musical instruments. As such Heinz's works were highly sought among art collectors and galleries and many would pay exorbitant amounts to own one of his works. :When the Nazi party began taking over Germany, Heinz fled the country for fear of political/artistic suppression. Traveling around the world, he eventually settled down in Japan, where he met and married a young Japanese woman. After the birth of their third daughter, Heinz travelled to the United States, where he disappeared under mysterious circumstances. His vast and priceless collection of art works were soon auctioned off and dispersed to art dealers around the world. Eventually, many pieces found their way to Japan in the hands of various private deals (many with criminal ties). In subsequent years, the collection were stolen piece by piece, regardless of heavy security, by a trio of thieves calling themselves \\"Cat's Eye\\", who were actually Heinz's grown-up daughters seeking clues to his whereabouts and hoping to get his attention to get him out of hiding. :Rui, Hitomi and Ai find that their father is in the U.S. and they go there to track him down. It is eventually revealed that Michael was actually betrayed and forced into exile by his jealous twin brother Cranaff („ÇØ„É©„Éä„ÉÉ„Éï), who then stole Michael's identity for profit with the syndicate. The revelation ends the sisters' hope of finding their father through recollecting his art work, and the Cat's Eye cease operations afterwards. ; : :Trusted friend and confidant to the three sisters, a very good friend of Heinz and his wife. Nagaishi provides detailed information for Cat's Eye's heists and also helps them acquire any hardware and/or other sophisticated equipment that they may need that Ai cannot provide. His background is a mystery but he may have been a member of the Armed Forces as he has some military expertise. ; : :A girl from Ai's school who took a picture of Hitomi while shooting photographs of the moon with a telelens. She later boasted to one of her friends that she had taken pictures of Cat's Eye, sending Ai (who overheard the conversation) panicking. Kasumi became determined to reveal Cat's Eye's true nature and planned to go to the place Cat's Eye's next target with her camera. She managed to get a good look at the backside of Cat's Eye and thought that Hitomi fits that picture very well, and became only more convinced when she sees Hitomi playing around with some punks in the park. Asatani has noticed this too and takes Kazumi into her confidence. With a story about her dad being away (that it is unsafe for a young girl to be alone at home), Kazumi infiltrates into the Kisugi's home and asks Ai to let her stay the night. However, the Kisugi sisters managed to cunningly circumvent Kazumi's suspicion by appearing that Hitomi was still at home during the Cat's Eye mission.  City Hunter Connection  In contrast to Angel Heart (which is set in alternate universe, despite sharing City Hunter characters), both Cat's Eye and City Hunter series are set in same universe. The titular City Hunter character, Ryo Saeba, is acquaintanced with them. He also has rivalry with them because he was helping police capture Cat's Eye. Despite their rivalry, they have great teamwork fighting against criminals. The sisters come to Ryo's rescue in City Hunter the Movie: Shinjuku Private Eyes when Ryo has trouble defeating his enemy. Media Manga Tsukasa Hojo's Cat's Eye was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from 1981 to 1985, with the chapters collected into 18 tank≈çbon by Shueisha.

No. 2268 is a June 10, 2003 decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in which the Court found that the common law definition of marriage, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman, violated section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Background The roots of the case began in December 2000 at the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto, when pastor Brent Hawkes began issuing banns of marriage\\"Gay pastor 'called to lead people to freedom' ; Puts same-sex marriages on political agenda\\". Toronto Star, December 17, 2000. in advance of performing wedding ceremonies for two same-sex couples ‚Äî Kevin Bourassa and Joe Varnell, and Anne and Elaine Vautour ‚Äî on January 14, 2001.\\"Same-sex couples preparing to tie knot: Weddings tomorrow\\". National Post, January 13, 2001. Because banns of marriage are accepted as a fully legal way to perform a marriage without the need for a city-issued marriage license, but marriages performed under either process require certification by the provincial registrar, the banns created a legal vacuum that would force a court case. Over the course of the year several other same-sex couples, among them Hedy Halpern and Colleen Rogers, and Michael Leshner and Michael Stark, joined the court challenge, which began hearings at the Ontario Superior Court in November 2001.\\"Same-sex marriage challenge begins\\". The Globe and Mail, November 6, 2001. Superior Court ruling On July 12, 2002, the Superior Court ruled that marriage rights must be extended to same-sex couples, but it suspended the ruling for a period of two years to permit the Legislative Assembly of Ontario time to comply with the ruling through the legislative process.\\"Gay activists rejoice as Ontario ruling paves way for same-sex marriages\\". Canadian Press, July 12, 2002. However, as the Constitution of Canada provides that the definition of marriage is under federal jurisdiction while only the implementation is left to the provinces,\\"Ontario weighs gay marriage options\\". Guelph Mercury, July 17, 2002. the decision left the situation unclear until the government of Jean Chr√©tien announced on July 29 that they would appeal.\\"Feds to appeal Ontario same-sex court ruling\\". CTV News, July 29, 2002. Court of Appeal The Ontario Court of Appeal handed down its ruling on June 10, 2003.\\"Appeals court declares same-sex marriage protected: Two Ontario men become legally married\\". Sudbury Star, June 11, 2003. The unanimous Court found that the exclusion of same-sex couples was a clear violation of the Charter and moreover did not constitute a \\"reasonable infringement\\" under section 1. In this respect the judgment followed much of what had been ruled elsewhere. The court also held that there was to be no suspension of the remedy as it applied to the general population, and that the new definition allowing same-sex couples to marry would take effect immediately. Results Leshner and Stark became the first gay couple to be issued a marriage license after the decision,\\"First same-sex wedding conducted after court win\\". Victoria Times-Colonist, June 11, 2003. while Bourassa and Varnell and the Vautours became the first legally recognized same-sex marriages overall since their marriages were deemed legal as of the date of the original ceremonies. A few months later, however, Bourassa and Varnell were denied entry to the United States when travelling to attend a human rights conference, because the United States Customs agent refused to accept the validity of their marriage.\\"Gay couple denied U.S. entry\\". Prince George Citizen, September 19, 2003. In the next two years following the decision, courts in seven of Canada's other nine provinces and one of its three territories also legalized same-sex marriage in their jurisdictions before the Parliament of Canada passed the Civil Marriage Act in 2005. The Globe and Mail, in choosing the \\"Nation Builders of the year,\\" selected the judges involved in the case, namely Chief Justice Roy McMurtry, Eileen Gillese and James MacPherson, while the Canadian edition of Time selected Stark and Leshner as its Canadian newsmakers of the year.\\"Gay couple named newsmaker\\".

He is best known for establishing the field of African-American art history and was influential in the African American Art movement.  Early life and education  Porter was born in Baltimore, Maryland on Dec 22, 1905. His father was an African Methodist Episcopal minister and his mother was a teacher. His brother John taught him to paint. He attended schools in Washington D.C. between 1918 and 1923, and later attended Howard University. Under the direction of James V. Herring, head of the Art Department at Howard University, Porter studied painting, drawing, and art history. Porter graduated from Howard University in 1926. He also studied for a degree at Teachers College, Columbia University. Harmon Foundation Collection Upon graduation, Porter accepted a position as instructor of painting and drawing at Howard University. He later became chairman of the art department, a position he held until his death in 1970. Porter attended The Art Institute of New York City. He later studied at the Art Students League of New York. Porter received a scholarship in 1935 from the Institute of International Education and was the recipient of a Rockefeller Foundation grant that allowed him to study art in Europe. He studied Baroque art at the Institute of Art and Archeology at the Sorbonne. He returned to the United States where he attended New York University, graduating in 1937 with a master's degree in art history. Porter's master's thesis, later the subject for his influential book, Modern Negro Art, focused on African-American art and artists. Career Porter taught at Howard University for more than forty years, together with artists such as James Lesesne Wells and Lois Mailou Jones. He headed the Art Department, and served as Director of the Art Gallery from 1953 through 1970. He published Modern Negro Art in 1943, the first comprehensive study in the United States of African-American art. Porter decisively placed African-American artists within the framework of American art. He was the first to recognize and document the significant contributions these artists made to the history of American art. With Porter's systematic approach, Modern Negro Art became and still is the foundation of African-American art history and for later texts. Porter's interest in nearly forgotten and often ignored artists of African descent was sparked by reading a brief article on African-American landscape artist Robert Scott Duncanson. Due to the account's brevity, Porter followed his curiosity to research Duncanson and other artists of African descent. Porter was the recipient of a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1945. He took a leave of absence from teaching and spent a year in Cuba from 1945 to 1946, studying art and culture in Cuba and Haiti. His thorough research on these countries and West Africa stimulated his creating courses at Howard in \\"Latin American Art\\" and \\"African Art and Architecture\\". In 1955, he was awarded a fellowship by the Belgium-American Art Seminar and studied Flemish and Dutch Art of the sixteenth thru the eighteenth century while in Belgium. With a grant from the newspaper, the Evening Star, Porter traveled to South Africa in 1963 to study West African architecture. He completed twenty-five paintings with South African themes during his time in the country. Porter's work was shown in many group exhibitions during his forty year career. In 1940 his work was displayed at the American Negro Exposition in Chicago, and in 1948, he mounted a one-man exhibition of his work with the Barnett-Aden Gallery in Washington, D.C. Personal life During his studies, Porter met Dorothy Burnett, a librarian at the Harlem branch of the New York Public Library, where he did research. On December 27, 1929, Porter and Burnett were married. They had one daughter, Constance Porter. They became professional as well as personal partners. Dorothy worked with Porter, providing bibliographic information critical to his investigations. Both worked at Howard University. Dorothy Porter was the director of Moorland Foundation, later known as the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center. She developed and catalogued information about African-American artists.  Honors and legacy  * Recipient of the Schomburg Portrait Prize, from the Harmon Foundation, for the painting entitled Woman Holding a Jug (1930). * Honored by President Lyndon Johnson, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the National Gallery of Art as one of America's most outstanding men of the arts.\\" * In 1990 Howard University founded an academic colloquium named in Porter's honor and has since held it annually. The Colloquium annually draws leading and emerging scholars in the field of study he helped establish. Presenters have included Porter students such as David Driskell and Tritobia Hayes Benjamin, along with other important scholars and artists, such as Lowery Stokes Sims, Richard A. Long, Richard Powell, Michael Harris, Judith Wilson, Samella Lewis, and Deborah Willis. On February 25, 2010 Swann Galleries auctioned an immense archive of research material amassed by Porter; it consisted of photographs, letters, exhibit catalogues, art books, flyers, and bibliographical data on important African-American artists. Acquired by Emory University, the papers include correspondence from virtually every major African-American artist from the 1920s forward: Romare Bearden, Lois Mailou Jones, Meta Fuller, Elizabeth Catlett, Hughie Lee-Smith, and many others.http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/stories/2011/11/research_marbl_aquires_papers_art_biggers_jones.html  References   External links  * Catalogue listing for Swann Galleries auction of Porter's Art History Reference archive *The art of James A.

NZNOG has existed as a legal entity in the form of the NZNOG Trust since 2009. NZNOG runs a yearly conference, during which workshops, tutorials and presentations on various topics of interest to the network operations community in New Zealand. It also provides an excellent opportunity to network with others in the industry - there is usually at least one evening which provides a catered dinner, as well as opportunity for BoF's. The ongoing success of the NZNOG Conference owes much to the enthusiastic support of its participants, being key staff of various New Zealand Internet service providers, IT companies and tertiary education institutions. As an example of the role NZNOG has had in the Internet world in New Zealand, it played a major part in the formation of the first of the vendor-neutral Peering Exchanges in New Zealand - such as the Wellington Internet Exchange (WIX) and the Auckland Peering Exchange (APE).

Standing at with 26 floors, the building occupies a footprint on the eastern periphery of Kennedy Plaza. The building has been vacant since April 2013. History Butler Exchange building Before the current building was erected, the site was the location of the six-story Butler Exchange building. Located at 55 Exchange Place and constructed in 1872, the land was purportedly deeded by the heirs of the original Samuel Butler. Due to address changes across the city, by 1913 it bore the address 123 Westminster. The 1872 building housed the Rhode Island Commercial School which was purchased and merged into Bryant & Stratton College in 1916, the forerunner of Bryant University. It housed many retail businesses such as Dodge and Camfield (importers and grocers), A. & L. Tirocchi Gowns, and the Waite Auto Supply Company. The Providence Ladies' Sanitary Gymnasium was also a tenant. That building was demolished in 1925, after a devastating fire, to make way for a new tower. Industrial Trust Company Commissioned in 1925 by the Industrial Trust Company (founded in 1886 by Samuel P. Colt), the current building was constructed during the inter-war boom period as the Industrial Trust Tower in 1927. Designed in the Art Deco style popular at the time, the building opened for tenants on October 1, 1928. It was renamed Fleet Bank Tower when Industrial Trust changed its name to Fleet Financial Group in 1982. It remained Fleet's headquarters until Fleet merged with Shawmut National Bank in 1995 and moved to Boston as FleetBoston Financial. FleetBoston Financial retained ownership of the building at that time. In 1998 FleetBoston Financial was acquired by Bank of America, and the building became the Bank of America Building. In 2008, shortly before the Great Recession in the United States, the building was purchased by High Rock Development of Massachusetts for $33.2 million. Bank of America was the building's sole tenant, and utilized about half the building. Bank of America invested $7 million in a new sprinkler and fire safety system. Vacancy In 2012, Bank of America, still the sole tenant, decided not to renew its lease. The bank vacated the building, leaving it empty. High Rock's request for public funds to redevelop the building was turned down. State taxpayers, still smarting from the controversial money-losing loan to 38 Studios in 2012, were in no mood to offer public funding or tax credits. In 2016, it was estimated that at least $115 million would be needed to rehabilitate the building. Bank of America litigation In 2013, High Rock sued Bank of America for millions of dollars, claiming that the bank had neglected upkeep of the building and left it in a deteriorating state. The building is pockmarked with gaps of missing limestone, and is surrounded by scaffolding to prevent injuries to passers-by. High Rock brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, claiming that the bank failed to meet its repair and replacement obligations under a long- term lease, rendering the building unleasable. High Rock sought up to $54 million in damages. The bank brought a counterclaim seeking recovery of monies spent removing furniture from the building after the lease expired. The counterclaim was subsequently dismissed by the court (Smith, J.),High Rock Westminster Street LLC v. Bank of America, N.A. Opinion and Order, United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, 6 August 2014. Retrieved 29 August 2017. and the case was scheduled for trial in May 2017. Shortly after jury empanelment, the bank settled the suit on confidential terms.Mooney, Tom. \\"Superman building lawsuit settled\\", The Providence Journal, 8 May 2017. Retrieved 29 August 2017. Architectural details Main doors Of steel-frame structure sheathed in Indiana limestone, with Deer Island granite at its base, the tower was advertised as ‚ÄúA Business Building for Building Business.‚Äù It has six wings stemming from a central tower. Though stepped buildings in New York City had been a common solution for Manhattan's strict 1916 zoning policies regarding adequate light and air, there were no such restrictions in Providence; nevertheless, New York architects Walker & Gillette chose to include the innovative symmetrical stepped massing, with the assistance of local architect George Frederick Hall. The base and the trim at the base's top were built to match the cornice height of existing adjacent (now gone) four-story buildings.Woodward, Wm McKenzie. Guide to Providence Architecture. 1st ed. United States: 2003. . p. 101. It was among the tallest buildings in New England when completed, and ranked third after its construction to the 1919 Travelers Tower (at 527 feet/161 m) in Hartford, Connecticut, Emporis.com, Travelers Tower, Hartford, CT and the 1915 expansion of the Custom House Tower (at 496 feet/151 m) in Boston. The majority of relief art is found on the cornice of the tower's base, where 22 frames depict scenes of Native American and Colonist interaction and stages of Industrialization alongside four seals, and four eagles. Dual street-level staircases rise at the east and west ends of a stately columned grand hall, which is three stories high and runs the length of the building; it contains large windows that overlook Kennedy Plaza and the Arcade Building. The balcony level of the grand hall contains the lobby and entrance to an intimate ballroom with marble fireplaces and brass chandeliers. The 26th floor hosted the executive office of Industrial Trust Company. The suite contains secretary staff common areas, dining room and offices. A stairway leads to the higher north-face 29th level private 'dining car' or Gondola room designed to resemble the gondola of an airship; the room contains a wine closet and dark leather details. A peregrine falcon nest box is located in the area. The 28th and 29th floors contain a gravity water-service system; two large tanks these levels feed the building. The 29th floor contains a lavatory for service to the Gondola rooms and adjoining balconies. In the basement is a vault, designed to house small and large items, supplied with storage areas for client possessions such as fine rugs. The vault has a 17-ton (15.5 tonne) door. The metal doors and trim were manufactured by Dalhstrom Metallic Door Company of Jamestown, New York. Some of the street-level doors possess relief art of eagles in brass. The original glass of the beacon was of green hue, and topped with a decorative globe, surrounded by a circle of stone eagles weighing 7.5 tons (6.8 tonnes). In 1932, it was damaged and repaired after a lightning strike. This architectural feature was removed in 1950 after one eagle fell to the street in 1930. Floors 5, 12, 14, 17, 18, 26 and 30 recede to form the building's distinctive profile. From nightfall until midnight, the building's peak is traditionally lit a bright blue with varying red and green at Christmas and Valentine's Day. The building has remained relatively unchanged over the years with the exception of the lobby, the upper windows and the two story turret tower and light beacon. Due to its vacant occupancy the exterior lights illuminating the superstructure are not lit. In 1973, the beacon tower was turned off for the first time since 1928 to conserve energy. Rehabilitation effort The building has remained relatively unchanged through the years. The latest update (2007) was tenant Bank of America's new fire suppression systems, which cost $7 million.Inside The Superman Building In 2011, speculation simmered that Bank of America, the building's last tenant, would move out at the end of its ten-year lease; which eventually led to the bank's 2012 announcement that it would vacate the space the coming year. In March 2013, Bank of America officially ceased operations at the building leaving it unoccupied. The Providence nighttime skyline was subsequently affected as the exterior nighttime lighting used to illuminate the upper structure was shut off, with the exception of the peak light. Subsequently, new owner High Rock Development - which purchased the building in 2008 for $33 Million - proposed to convert the building into mostly luxury apartments, involving $80 million in tax credits from the State. This plan was rejected and the State has applied to move some of their Health and Human Services offices into the now vacant property. High Rock Development has since offered a four-year plan that would require $40 million in new funding for the rehabilitation of the tower into a mix of uses that include retail, business and 285 residential units. The former and new financing proposals were met with mixed reaction with several individuals noting High Rock Development has $200 million available to put towards the rehab effort but has declined to do so.High Rock Development Closes $50 Million Fund, High Rock Fund I will be able to invest up to $200 million. An independent appraisal was completed in 2012, and in 2014 the Providence group Scotti and Associates used that appraisal to decide that the building had \\"no value.\\" In December 2017, Paolino Properties and Gilbane Development announced a plan that would involve demolishing the building and replacing it with a new 36-story building. This is one of several plans being pitched to Hasbro for a new headquarters in downtown Providence. In popular culture 111 Westminster Street is commonly referred to as the \\"Superman Building\\", due to its resemblance to the Daily Planet building in the Superman comic book. However, Superman co-creator Joe Shuster claims he drew his inspiration not from the Providence building (nor the also rumored AT&T; Huron Road Building in Cleveland, Ohio, where Shuster was living at the time), but rather from his home city of Toronto (such as the Commerce Court North and the Fairmont Royal York). The building shown in the television program, however, is the Los Angeles City Hall.CTV.ca: \\"Superman co-creator has humble Canadian roots\\". Accessed 25 July 2007.

Adstock is an important component of marketing-mix models. The term \\"adstock\\" was coined by Simon Broadbent.Broadbent, S. (1979) \\"One Way TV Advertisements Work\\", Journal of the Market Research Society Vol. 23 no.3. Adstock is a model of how response to advertising builds and decays in consumer markets. Advertising tries to expand consumption in two ways; it both reminds and teaches. It reminds in- the-market consumers in order to influence their immediate brand choice and teaches to increase brand awareness and salience, which makes it easier for future advertising to influence brand choice. Adstock is the mathematical manifestation of this behavioral process. The adstock theory hinges on the assumption that exposure to television advertising builds awareness in the minds of the consumers, influencing their purchase decision. Each new exposure to advertising builds awareness and this awareness will be higher if there have been recent exposures and lower if there have not been. In the absence of further exposures adstock eventually decays to negligible levels. Measuring and determining adstock, especially when developing a marketing-mix model is a key component of determining marketing effectiveness. There are two dimensions to advertising adstock: # decay or lagged effect. # saturation or diminishing returns effect.  Advertising lag: decay effect  The underlying theory of adstock is that the exposure to television advertising builds awareness in the consumer markets, resulting in sales. Each new exposure to advertising increases awareness to a new level. The decay effect of adstock eventually reduces awareness to its base level, unless or until this decay is reduced by new exposures. This decay effect can be mathematically modelled and is usually expressed in terms of the ‚Äòhalf-life‚Äô of the advertising. A ‚Äòtwo-week half- life‚Äô means that it takes two weeks for the awareness of an advertising to decay to half its present level. Every Ad copy is assumed to have a unique half-life. Some academic studies have suggested half-life range around 7‚Äì 12 weeks,Leone, R.P. (1995) ‚ÄúGeneralizing what is known about temporal aggregation and advertising carry-over‚Äù, Marketing Science, 14, G141-G150. while industry practitioners typically report half- lives between 2‚Äì5 weeks, with the average for Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Brands at 2.5 weeks. Adstock half-life can be estimated through a distributed lag model response with lags of the TV Gross Ratings Point (GRP) variable, using Least Squares.Fry, T.R.L., Broadbent, S. and Dixon, J.M. (2000), ‚ÄúEstimating Advertising Half-life and the Data Interval Bias‚Äù, Journal of Targeting, Measurement & Analysis in Marketing, 8, 314-334. Simple Decay-Effect Model: Below is a simple formulation of the basic Adstock model: A_t = T_t + \\\\lambda A_{t-1},\\\\;\\\\; t=1,...,n Where At is the Adstock at time t, Tt is the value of the advertising variable at time t, and Œª is the ‚Äòdecay‚Äô or lag weight parameter. Inclusion of the At-1 term imparts an infinite lag structure to this model, with the effect of the first Adstock term approaching 0, as t tends to ‚àû. This is a simple decay model, because it captures only the dynamic effect of advertising, not the diminishing returns effect.Joy, J. (2006). Understanding Advertising Adstock Transformation. Retrieved March 31, 2016, from https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/7683/4/MPRA_paper_7683.pdf  Advertising saturation: diminishing returns effect  Increasing the amount of advertising increases the percent of the audience reached by the advertising, hence increases demand, but a linear increase in the advertising exposure doesn‚Äôt have a similar linear effect on demand. Typically each incremental amount of advertising causes a progressively lesser effect on demand increase. This is advertising saturation. Saturation only occurs above a threshold level that can be determined by Adstock Analysis. File:Adstock2.png For e.g. for the ad copy in the above graph, saturation only kicks in above 110 GRPs per week. Adstock can be transformed to an appropriate nonlinear form like the logistic or negative exponential distribution, depending upon the type of diminishing returns or ‚Äòsaturation‚Äô effect the response function is believed to follow.  Campaign carry-over  The advertising carryover effect is a famous and debated effect of business marketing practices. Essentially, the carryover theory states that the positive benefits from advertising, especially increased sales, are not perfectly in step with advertising movements but rather delayed and spread out over time so that changes may not be noticeable immediately or measurable right after the advertising strategy has gone into effect.Lacoma, T. (n.d.) Problems With the Advertising Carryover Effect. Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://smallbusiness.chron.com/problems- advertising-carryover-effect-21824.html Carryover (measured from the end of a campaign) ranges between 3 weeks and 6 months. This establishes that consumer involvement has a noticeably positive impact on carry-over, as involved consumers have a better memory for commercials.Moorman, M., Willemsen, L. M., Neijens, P. C., & Smit, E. G. (2012). Program-involvement effects on commercial attention and recall of successive and embedded advertising. Journal of Advertising, 41(2), 25‚Äì37. Studies show long and expensive campaigns, result in competitive clutter, when several brands advertise simultaneously, competitive interference depreciates campaign accessibility and makes individuals forget the message more quickly.Norris, B. I. (2008). Pooling and dynamic of forgetting effects in multitheme advertising: tracking the advertising sales relationship with particle filters. Marketing Science, 27(4), 659‚Äì673. Observations show noticeable wear-out effects as carry-overs are shortened when brands air multiple campaigns and/or increase the size of their advertising budget. These results are noteworthy because it shows that advertising intensity, competitive interference and wear-out effects have impacts on advertising effectiveness.Aurier, P., Broz-Giroux, A. (2013). Modeling Advertising Impact at Campaign Level: Empirical Generalization Relative to Long-term Advertising Profit Contribution and its Antecedents. New York, NY : Springer Media. The negative impacts of campaign carryovers include: *Analysis Difficulty: A campaign carryover effect makes it very difficult to analyze the success of marketing campaign. Businesses have to choose a time period after the advertising to gauge the effects on sales by comparing it to a previous period. But if the effects are delayed, the business does not know when to start the period or how long to make it for the most accurate result. Market forces, price changes and other factors will change sales themselves if the company waits too long to make its analysis. *Advertising Problems: Advertising problems can be resolved if they are quickly dealt with. Some problems, however, can be subtle and if the carryover effect exists, the company may not even be aware of the problem until it is too late to fix it. If positive results are delayed, so are issues with advertising strategy that could otherwise be repaired. This leaves very little room for mistakes. *Changing Markets: Many types of advertising are based on rapidly changing markets. Trends can shift suddenly, problems can arise and create the need for marketing solutions, and other changes can make it necessary to update or replace advertising very quickly. But if the carryover effect exists, then the original gains that the advertising plan generated may not have occurred yet before it is changed, leading to an essential blindness when it comes to measuring ad effectiveness.Lacoma, T.

Best known today for his work on hay fever, he was one of the most respected doctors of his time, a social reformer, Harvard overseer, hospital president, and author in his long lifetime. Wyman was the son of Dr. Rufus Wyman, first director of the McLean Asylum, and Elizabeth Morrill. He and his brother Jeffries Wyman (later first curator of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard) graduated from Harvard in 1833 and received medical degrees in 1837. Soon thereafter he set up a medical practice in Cambridge which he continued for over 50 years. Another brother, Edward Wyman (1818 - 1899), was a prominent merchant and the captain of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts.Boston Evening Transcript, October 27, 1899, \\"Recent Deaths: Colonel Edward Wyman\\", p. 4 Medical Work Early in his career Wyman became interested in ventilation, and became an expert on the ventilation of sickrooms and public buildings. A paper on the subject won an award from the Massachusetts Medical Society, and he published a book on the subject in 1846. He also devised a method and device for removing excess fluid from the chest cavity (1850). During the Civil War he served on a Sanitary Committee that inspected army medical facilities, being considered too old and too busy of a doctor to send to the front lines. After the Civil War Wyman became interested in hay fever, which he and members of his family suffered from, and he conducted experiments that convinced him that ragweed was a cause of what he called \\"Autumnal Cattarh\\"; gathering data from correspondents, he published the first pollen maps of the United States so that sufferers could plan vacations in low pollen areas. In 1850, Wyman performed the first recorded thoracentesis, later described by Henry Ingersoll Bowditch after performing the procedure on one of Bowditch's patients the same year. Wyman lectured on medical subjects for many years, both at a private medical school which he and his brother Jeffries conducted in Boston and at Harvard, where he served as interim professor of anatomy 1853-1856. He took a special interest in the Harvard Medical School during his terms as a Harvard overseer (1875‚Äì1887). Corporal Punishment The whipping of a 16-year-old girl named Josephine Foster in a Cambridge school in 1866 gave Wyman a new cause. Convinced that it was harmful to use corporal punishment on young women and girls, Wyman led a petition drive, spoke and wrote on the subject, and ultimately served terms on the Cambridge School Board. He soon allied with others such as Bostonian John P. Ordway who wished to ban corporal punishment in the public schools for both sexes. Wyman testified at a hearing in 1868 on a bill to abolish all corporal punishment in public schools in Massachusetts - a bill which passed the lower house of the General Court, but failed in the Senate. (Corporal punishment in public schools was ultimately prohibited by law in Massachusetts in 1972.) His efforts did not lead to a long-standing ban on corporal punishment in Cambridge schools, but increased public awareness of it, and new reporting requirements probably reduced it considerably. Other Accomplishments Morrill Wyman also served as president of \\"Cambridge Hospital\\" (now Mount Auburn Hospital) during the construction of its first building; a building at the hospital now bears his name. After formally closing his practice in 1892 (although he continued to see devoted patients for many years after that), Wyman wrote an article and later a book on the life of Daniel Treadwell, inventor and Harvard professor, who had been a friend of Wyman's. During his long career as a physician, he treated many prominent patients, including Theodore Roosevelt, Charles Eliot, and Louis Agassiz. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Personal life Wyman married Elizabeth Aspinwall Pulsifer, the orphan daughter of a ship's captain, and they had four children. He was greatly saddened by the death of his brother Jeffries in 1872. His son Morrill Wyman Jr. wrote a short book on the lives of his father and grandfather; it was published privately not long before his own death in 1913.

There are two broad categories: tinner's snips, which are similar to common scissors, and compound-action snips, which use a compound leverage handle system to increase the mechanical advantage. Types 12\\" Gilbow tin snips. Made in England. Tinner snips Tinner's snips, also known as tinner snips or tin snips, are one of the most popular type of snips. They are defined by their long handles and short blades. They usually have extra wide jaws and are made of drop forged carbon steel. Depending on the size of the blade, tin snips can cut between 24 and 16 gauge cold rolled low-carbon tin. They can be ranged in length from long. There are two main types: straight- pattern and duckbill-pattern. Straight-pattern are best for straight cuts, but can handle gentle curves. Duckbill-pattern snips, also known as trojan-pattern snips, have blades that taper down from the pivot to the tip of the blades. The blade edges are also bevelled to more easily cut curves and circles or shapes. They are a lighter duty snip that can only cut up to 25 gauge mild steel. Other common blade patterns include the circle pattern or curved pattern and the hawk's-bill pattern. Circle pattern snips have a curved blade and are used to cut circles. Hawk's-bill snips are used to cut small radii on the inside and outside of a circle. The shape of the blades allow for sharp turns without buckling the sheet metal. A common use is cutting holes in pipes. Compound-action snips Right cutting and left-cutting compound- action snips, respectively; the green snips are an offset-pattern Straight- cutting compound-action snips Compound-action snips, also known as aviation snips, maille snips or sheet snips, are the most popular type of snips as they are able to exert a higher force compared to other types of snip of the same size, because of the design of their linkage. They were first developed to cut aluminum in the construction of aircraft, hence they are often referred to as aviation snips. They can handle aluminium up to 18 gauge, mild steel up to 24 gauge or stainless steel up to 26 gauge. There are three cutting styles for compound-action snips: straight cutting, left cutting, and right cutting. Straight cutting snips (generally have yellow colored soft grips) cut in a straight line and wide curves; left cutting snips (usually red) will cut straight and in a tight curve to the left; right cutting snips (usually green) will cut straight and in a tight curve to the right. These different cutting styles are necessary because metal is stiff and heavy and does not move out of the way readily when cutting around a curve. The respective styles move the material out of the way when cutting in the direction they are designed for. The blades are usually serrated to prevent material slippage. Tin snips In addition to the configurations outlined below, there are also upright and long cut configurations. The upright snip has the blades rotated 90¬∞ from the handles. This configuration is more ergonomic and commonly used in tight spaces. The long cut snip has long blades that make it easier to make long straight cuts. These snips are commonly used on vinyl or aluminium siding. Standard compound-action snips are designed for cutting steel or softer materials, although the occasional use on stainless steel is not detrimental. For cutting through tougher materials, such as inconel and titanium, special hard snips are available. They are similar in design to standard or offset aviation snips but have specially heat treated blades. These snips will have a different color handle to differentiate them from the other standard types. Pipe and duct snips Pipe and duct snips, also known as double cut snips, are a subtype of compound-action snip used to cut stove pipe and ducting lengthwise. The snips have a three-piece jaw that has two side blades that slide against a central blade. This creates a wide strip that curls up along the cut. A compound lever system is used to increase the mechanical advantage. Configuration The following types of snips are available in different configurations. The first is the angle of the blades to the handles. If the handles are inline with the blades then the combination is known as a straight snips; if the handles are at an angle then it is known as an offset configuration. This design allows for the material to flow away from the blades when making long cuts, which is easier and safer than straight cutting snips. The bulldog-pattern is a blade pattern that has longer handles to increase the mechanical advantage of the snips. In tinner's snips this means the handles are extra long. The compound-action bulldog-pattern, also known as a notch snips, has the ability to cut up to 16 gauge cold rolled sheet metal or multiple layers of sheet metal up to thick. Some snips have replaceable blades for when the blade becomes worn out. An added advantage to this is the ability to make the rest of the snips from a light weight material, usually aluminum. This helps to reduce fatigue.

It would be the last Dornier-designed aircraft to reach production before the company's collapse during the early 2000s. The 328JET was designed by Dornier in response to negative feedback from some customers on the marketability of turboprops against the more appealing turbofan engine. It was a relatively straightforward re-reengining of the existing 328, being originally designated as the 328-300 prior to being rebranded as the 328JET. During 1996, early on in the programme, the financially distressed Dornier company was acquired by the American aerospace firm Fairchild Aircraft; the resulting corporation, named Fairchild Dornier, continued development of the 328JET. On 20 January 1998, the first 328JET prototype conducted its maiden flight. While production of the 328 family was performed in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, sales activity was centred in San Antonio, Texas and support for Dornier's products was provided from both locations. At one stage, a stretched variant of the 328JET, commonly referred to as the 428JET, was under active development. However, amid intense competition in the international market for regional jets, Fairchild Dornier were unable to attain enough sales of the type to maintain production. During 2002, the final 328JET left the production line, while support for existing aircraft continues to be provided. While a prospective revival of the programme has been mooted on multiple occasions, nothing concrete has occurred as of 2019. Design and development Background During the early 1990s, German manufacturer Dornier had launched their turboprop-powered Dornier 328 onto the market. However, some prospective customers reported a negative perception of noise and reliability issues with turboprop engines, which motivated the company to study the manufacture of a turbofan-based variant, initially referred to as the 328-300. Market research had indicated that, provided that both the economics and performance of such an aircraft were competitive, this would have greater desirability amongst the market. According to Fairchild Dornier president Jim Robinson, such an arrangement had been examined early on in the 328's development process but had been rejected by then-parent company Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (DASA). Reportedly, producing a jet-powered version of the airliner had been greatly aided by the relatively conservative structural design of the 328.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\"Jet age dawns for 328.\\" Flight International, 11 February 1998. Relatively few design modifications between the two airliners were necessary.Henley, Peter. \\"Joining the jet set.\\" Flight International, 1 July 1999. By November 1996, according to Dornier vice-president for sales Andrew Jampoler, a feasibility study for the programme had been completed and the company was close to selecting an engine; options considered included the General Electric CFE738, Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306, and the LF507-1F, as well as a de-rated LF507-2 powerplant. By adopting one of these engines, a cruise speed of between 375kt (690km/h) and 390kt at 22,000ft (6,700m) could be achieved, noticeably higher than the original 328's current maximum speed of 335kt at the same altitude. Conservative projections anticipated the jet-powered airliner to consume roughly 30% more fuel than its turboprop-powered predecessor, although it was believed that this difference would be decreased by further refinements. Jampoler also stated that Dornier had forecast an in-service date of late 1998. Dornier ultimately opted for the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306/9 engine. During early February 1997, Dornier formally launched the 328JET programme. Original programme Pratt & Whitney Canada owned 328JET at Pearson International Airport During the mid-1990s, Dornier experienced considerable financial difficulties; these heavily contributed to the company's acquisition by the American aerospace firm Fairchild Aircraft, after which the organisation became Fairchild Dornier.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\"Fit for Europe's future.\\" Flight International, 8 April 1998. The new entity chose to continue with the programme, albeit rebranding the type as the 328JET. Even following the acquisition, considerable pressure remained on the programme's finances, extending through to its suppliers, leading to reorganisations and premature withdrawals from involvement.\\"Daewoo dumps Dornier 328 contract.\\" Flight International, 26 March 1997.\\"328 production switch.\\" Flight International, 4 June 1997. By the end of 1997, Dornier-Fairchild had cut its annual costs by $58 million, and anticipated exceeding its $115 million cost-cutting target within two years. Management shake-ups and other measures continued to be performed as part of efforts to reform the business.\\"Fairchild Dornier is shaken up with major management changes.\\" Flight International, 24 June 1998. In spite of internal pressures, senior figures remained upbeat about the prospects for the 328JET and the regional jet market.\\"Regional jets find a home.\\" Flight International, 7 May 1997. During June 1997, the first sales of the type were announced, French regional operator Proteus Airlines emerged as the launch customer as a result of a $70 million order for six aircraft, alongside orders from other customers.\\"328 JET sales kicked off by French order.\\" Flight International, 19 June 1997.\\"Fairchild Dornier wins 328Jet launch orders.\\" Flight International, 25 June 1997. It was hoped that the 328JET would have market appeal with those who found the 328 to not meet their preferences, in particular those customers based in the Middle East.\\"High hopes for 328JET sales in Mid-East market.\\" Flight International, . By the end of the year, Dornier had reportedly secured 17 firm orders and 15 options, while the company claimed it was negotiating two major orders for up to 180 aircraft with the aim of closing over the following three months. Dornier representatives believed that there was a viable market for up to 600 328JETs.Lopez, Ramon. \\"Survival of the fastest?\\" Flight International, 13 May 1998. According to Andrew Doyle of the aerospace periodical Flight International, the reenginging programme was being well-received, referring to it as a \\"a new lease of life\\".Doyle, Andrew. \\"Joining the jet age.\\" Flight International, 22 September 1999. By March 1997, reports emerged that Dornier was set to start converting the second 328 prototype into the first turbofan- powered 328JET prototype. During October 1997, as work was underway on building the first prototype, Dornier announced several improvements to the aircraft, including a higher cruise speed of 400kt that was achieved via a minor reduction of the trailing edge flaps.\\"328JET prepared for first flight.\\" Flight International, 15 October 1997. On 6 December 1997, the 328JET prototype rolled out at Dornier's facility outside Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, after which ground-based testing commenced immediately.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\"Fairchild rolls out first 328JET.\\" Flight International, 17 December 1997. On 20 January 1998, the prototype conducted its maiden flight; it was piloted by Meinhardt Feuersenger, hitherto chief test pilot of the turboprop 328, and Peter Weger. This initial flight over the Bavarian Alps attained a peak altitude of 25,000ft (7,600m) and lasted for almost 2 hours.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\"Fairchild Dornier flies 328JET.\\" Flight International, 28 January 1998. The flight test programme would involve a total of four prototypes. According to Dornier, performance figures gained from the flight testing phase had either met or exceeded their established expectations. Certification was delayed by four months to address issues with the 328JET's undercarriage, specifically involving the brakes and shock absorbers. During July 1999, type certification was granted by the European Joint Aviation Authorities, corresponding approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was received within the following weeks.\\"Fairchild 328JET receives European certification.\\" Flight International, 14 July 1999. Early on the 328JET programme, Dornier were already considering options for a stretched version of the aircraft, originally referred to as the 328-700. During 1998, following the first flight of the type, Fairchild-Dornier opted to pursue development of the stretched 428JET, a 44-seat version of the 328JET.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\"Early Launch in store for 428JET.\\" Flight International, 18 February 1998. Work proceeded to the point several customers had signed letters of intent to purchase the upcoming aircraft. Furthermore, Dornier had planned to conduct a comprehensive upgrade of the existing model, involving an avionics overhaul and possible re-winging to use a new swept wing, around the early 2000s. By 1998, a dedicated corporate-orientated version, branded Envoy 3, was also being promoted.\\"Fairchild Dornier reveals plans for corporate 328JET model.\\" Flight International, 24 September 1997.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"Fairchild Dornier creates new identity for corporate 328JET.\\" Flight International, 27 May 1998. However, a consequence of intense competition within the regional airliner market was multiple manufacturers making losses and terminating their programmes; Fairchild-Dornier were no exception to the industry-wide pressure.\\"Too big a crowd.\\" Flight International, 5 November 1997.O'Toole, Kevin. \\"Regional Revolution.\\" Flight International, 11 February 1998. The limited commercial performance of the 328JET had placed Fairchild-Dornier into a precarious financial position, the company ultimately being unable to continue the development of further models. As such, the 328JET became the last commercial aircraft to be produced by the former Dornier business prior to being rendered insolvent during 2002.  Post-Dornier developments  Following Dornier's insolvency, AvCraft Aviation of Virginia acquired the 328 program during March 2003. This acquisition included rights to the design itself, a total of 18 328JETs in various stages of assembly, and the development work on the 428JET. After the sale of these airplanes, AvCraft negotiated with its suppliers to resume production due to low profit expectations for its other projects. During 2004, the first of AvCraft's 328JET was delivered. ADAC 328JET air ambulance During 2005, AvCraft itself filed for bankruptcy. As a consequence, the firm was acquired by private equity investors and reformed as M7 Aerospace. During June 2006, 328 Support Services GmbH acquired the 328JET type certificate. However, this entity did not resume manufacturing of the type; instead, it opted to provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services to the 330 in-service fleet. During February 2015, US engineering company Sierra Nevada Corporation acquired 328 Support Services GmbH. Shortly thereafter, Sierra Nevada's owner, Turkish- American Engineer Fatih Ozmen, established a private corporation named √ñzjet Havacƒ±lƒ±k Teknolojileri A.≈û. at Technopark of Bilkent University, Ankara and signed a Memorandum of understanding with the Transportation Ministry of Turkey in order to manufacture the 328 at Ankara. In June 2015, the Turkish government launched the Turkish TR328 and TRJ328 regional aircraft project, a modernized 328/328JET, with either turboprops or jets. It could be followed by the larger TR628/TRJ-628. At one point, the first flight of a Turkish-built aircraft was anticipated to occur during 2019. However, During October 2017, Turkey announced that it was abandoning the programme as a consequence of escalating costs. Stating that they believe demand in the sub 40-seat market is still present for the type, Sierra Nevada Corporation and 328 Support Services GmbH began to seek out for other opportunities in order to revive the aircraft, hoping to follow through by the end of 2017 or early 2018.

The name comes from the combination of the genus names. Both diploid hybrids and allopolyploid hybrids are known and share this name. Early experimental crosses between species of these two genera had been sterile or nearly sterile, but large-scale experiments by Soviet agronomist Georgi Dmitrievich Karpechenko using Raphanus sativus and Brassica oleracea were remarkable because some of the plants produced hundreds of seeds. The second generation were allopolyploids, the result of gametes with doubled chromosome numbers. As Karpechenko realized, this process had created a new species, and it could justifiably be called a new genus, and proposed the name Raphanobrassica for them, but the earlier name Brassicoraphanus has priority. Plants of this parentage are now known as radicole. Two other fertile forms of Brassicoraphanus are known by the following informal names: * The Raparadish group are allopolyploid hybrids between Raphanus sativus and Brassica rapa, used as fodder crops * The Radicole group are allopolyploid hybrids between Raphanus sativus and Brassica oleracea, used as fodder crops * Raphanofortii is the allopolyploid hybrid between Brassica tournefortii and Raphanus caudatus Currently, it is thought that a great part of the flowering plants have some hybridization and polyploidization among their ancestors.

EQCA noted that Poochigian opposed every major LGBT bill, including: AB 1001 (prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation); AB 537 (protected LGBT children from harassment and violence in public schools); and AB 25 (established the most basic rights for same-sex domestic partners). Attorney General campaign (2006) In the 2006 California elections, Poochigian was defeated by Democrat Jerry Brown, the former governor of California and at the time, mayor of Oakland, for California Attorney General, receiving 38.2% of the vote, to Brown's 56.4%. Poochigian's campaign was characterized as one of the most aggressive and creative down-ballot races in 2006. The campaign was featured by The Wall Street JournalLovley, Erika (October 14, 2006) \\"Politicians Try Out MySpace\\". The Wall Street Journal, p. A4 and others for its use of emerging technology, such as MySpace, YouTube, and other online mediums, to reach out to voters and mobilize activists. One notable attack ad released by the Brown campaign voiced over by Peter Coyote stated that Poochigian had a 0% rating on the environment. The ad also made the claim that Poochigian flatly rejects \\"Sound Science\\" which caused confusion about what exactly \\"Sound Science\\" means. The National Journal's \\"Hotline\\" named the campaign one of the country's top 15 down-ballot races to watch. A post-election Los Angeles Times article stated: \\"[T]he famously collegial Poochigian, 57, proved reliably feisty, hitting Brown hard for Oakland's skyrocketing murder rate and a past littered with Moonbeam moments during his long-ago stint in Sacramento and lefty pronouncements while he was a talk radio host in the 1990s.\\"Bailey, Eric (November 8, 2006) \\"Brown Easily Wins Attorney General's Race\\". Los Angeles Times. Appellate Court Justice (2009) On August 20, 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger nominated Poochigian to become a justice of the California Court of Appeal, Fifth Appellate District. On September 24, 2009, Poochigian was unanimously confirmed to the court by California's Commission on Judicial Appointments, consisting in this case of Chief Justice Ronald M. George, Fifth District Presiding Justice James A. Ardaiz, and Attorney General Brown. At the confirmation hearing, Chief Justice George \\"ripped into the commission that rated [Poochigian] \\"not qualified\\" for the post,\\" noting that there was a \\"real problem in the process\\" used by the Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation, and strongly urging that there be \\"some revisions in the procedure.\\" Chief Justice George and Justice Ardaiz criticized the JNE commission for disregarding its own standards and the statutory standards that are supposed to govern its processes. Still, Poochigian's appointment was not without controversy. JNE Commission Chair Jonathan Wolf of San Francisco wrote to the Chief Justice that Poochigian ‚Äúis intelligent, diligent, and articulate...and is committed to public service‚Äù but continued that in the Commission's view \\"Poochigian‚Äôs legal background [did] not qualify him for the appellate bench.\\" In explaining the Commission's findings, Wolf continued, \\"he [Poochigian] had not practiced law for approximately 21 years and had not litigated a case in approximately the same amount of time. Moreover, he has no jury trials and no criminal law experience.\\" Among other groups, Poochigian's appointment was strongly opposed by the National Organization for Women and Equality California In a circulated letter opposing Mr. Poochigian's appointment, California National Organization for Women President Patricia Bellasalma wrote,\\"Mr. Poochigian‚Äôs long political history of being vehemently opposed to the rights of women, the LGBT community, workers and people of color in addition to having no credible legal experience qualifying him for the bench, as determined by the California State Bar, amplifies this travesty.‚Äù On April 8, 2005, as a California State Senator and assistant Republican leader, Judge Poochigian published an article in the San Diego Union-Tribune, entitled \\"Using the ADA to abuse the legal system\\" where he ridiculed the ADA requirements for basic accommodations for disability, such as grab bars around toilets and levers on doors and faucets, and referred to those requirements as \\"payday for shakedown artists.\\" References External links *Chuck Poochigian at MySpace Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:California state senators Category:Members of the California State Assembly Category:American people of Armenian descent Category:Ethnic Armenian politicians Category:California Republicans Category:Judges of the California Courts of Appeal Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American judges Category:Candidates in the 2006 United States elections ","title":"Chuck Poochigian"},{"id":"4484190","text":"Maison de la Champagne, SIege de CIVC Le Comit√© Interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne (CIVC) is an organisation grouping the actors of the Champagne production and trade - growers, cooperatives and merchants - under the direction of the government. It is charged with organizing and controlling the production, distribution, and promotion of the wines of Champagne as well as conducting research. Until 1990 it set the price of grapes and still intervenes to regulate the size of the harvest and to limit the production of wine in order to maintain market prices. One of the prominent activities of CIVC is to safeguard the name Champagne, which is a protected designation of origin as well as a very valuable trademark. CIVC is quick to resort to litigation at any non-authorized use of the Champagne name. CIVC also operates activities in other countries to educate consumers and to have national representation for the protection of the Champagne name. An example is the Champagne Bureau (formerly the Office of Champagne) in the United States.champagne.us: About us , accessed on December 7, 2009 History CIVC was established on April 13, 1941, while Germany was occupying Champagne and other parts of France during World War II. Since the occupation meant requisitions and strict control of trade, both by the occupational power and the Vichy regime, Champagne producers saw a need to present a unified front to the Germans. Robert-Jean de Vog√º√©, who was heading Mo√´t & Chandon, took the initiative and became the person who was appointed by CIVC to negotiate with the Germans.

The Hilbert spectrum (sometimes referred to as the Hilbert amplitude spectrum), named after David Hilbert, is a statistical tool that can help in distinguishing among a mixture of moving signals. The spectrum itself is decomposed into its component sources using independent component analysis. The separation of the combined effects of unidentified sources (blind signal separation) has applications in climatology, seismology, and biomedical imaging. Conceptual summary The Hilbert spectrum is computed by way of a 2-step process consisting of: * Preprocessing a signal separate it into intrinsic mode functions using a mathematical decomposition such as singular value decomposition (SVD); * Applying the Hilbert transform to the results of the above step to obtain the instantaneous frequency spectrum of each of the components. The Hilbert transform defines the imaginary part of the function to make it an analytic function (sometimes referred to as a progressive function), i.e. a function whose signal strength is zero for all frequency components less than zero. With the Hilbert transform, the singular vectors give instantaneous frequencies that are functions of time, so that the result is an energy distribution over time and frequency. The result is an ability to capture time-frequency localization to make the concept of instantaneous frequency and time relevant (the concept of instantaneous frequency is otherwise abstract or difficult to define for all but monocomponent signals).

The Marine Corps is commanded by a two- star marine general. As of August 2018, it has three divisions, each led by a one-star marine general: * Pasukan Marinir I / PASMAR I (Marine Force I) based in Sidoarjo. * Pasukan Marinir II / PASMAR II (Marine Force II) based in Jakarta. * Pasukan Marinir III / PASMAR III (Marine Force III) based in Sorong. The Marine Corps was initially formed as a special operations force for the Indonesian Navy (TNI-AL), then named Korps Komando abbreviated \\"KKO\\" (lit: \\"Commandos Corps\\"). The Marine Corps was actively involved in various confrontations and conflicts in Indonesia. The Marine Corps also maintains a joint Navy-Marine special operations unit, known as Detasemen Jala Mangkara or \\"DENJAKA\\" (Jala Mangkara Detachment) created on 1 December 1984, and draws operators from the KOPASKA (Navy's Frogman Commando Force) and Taifib (Marine's Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion). History Indonesian marine corps battling Permesta insurgents, 1950‚Äì1960s The forerunner of the Marine Corps was the Corps Mariniers(CM), which was formed on 15 November 1945 at Base IV of ALRI (the previous name of Indonesian Navy) in Tegal. The date was later commemorated as the birthday of the Marine Corps. The CM was originally intended to serve as 'training school' for Navy sailors to be able to fight in ground warfare in case of emergency. Most of its pioneer instructors were graduates of the sailing school. However, at least one of its instructors, Tatang Rusmaja, a former PETA member, actually had experience in ground warfare. Due to a lack of naval equipment or ships, the CM was forced to join guerrilla warfare in the jungles and mountains of Central Java. Marines were deployed several times along with the Army to fight the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and during this time, the commander of armed forces assigned the CM, which had combat experience as a ground unit, away from the Navy and transformed into a regiment within Diponegoro Division of Indonesian Army on 17 March 1948. On 9 October 1948, the Ministry of Defense acknowledged the need for an amphibious commando unit and issued Minister Decree No. A/565/1948 regarding the establishment of a naval infantry corps within the Navy named Korps Komando (KKO) or Naval Commando Corps. The first recruitment batch of this new commando unit arrived in 1949 and almost all of the first recruits were veterans of the CM in Tegal. Later on, the huge number of CM veterans in active duty within this formation would later justify the date of the Marine Corps Birthday, being set and held annually every 15 November in memory of its foundation. In 1950 the armored element was raised, the basis of the 1st Marine Cavalry Regiment, armed at first with equipment left behind by the Dutch. LVTs, circa 1960s. Location unknown Indonesian Navy Commandos (KKO Marines) occupying Langowan Airfield circa 1960s The KKO was active in various military operations in Indonesia. One of the largest amphibious military operations would have been Operation Jayawijaya in which thousands of marines were planned to land on Biak in 1963 as a part of the Trikora Campaign to take West Irian from Dutch control. The operation was aborted as a consequence of deals preceding the New York Agreement. That campaign saw massive rearmament of the Corps as per the national policies of guided democracy in the later years of the Sukarno presidency, part of the increasing military ties between Indonesia and the Warsaw Pact, wherein the former US-made equipment would be replaced by Russian-produced APCs and IFVs including the PT-76 Amphibious light tanks, BTR-50 APCs and BM-13 MRLs (Southeast Asia's first-ever MRL system in service). At the height of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, Harun Hj Mohd Said and Usman Ali (hereinafter known as Usman Harun), two members of the KKO were dispatched to Singapore using rubber boats. Their main task was to infiltrate and sabotage the interests of Malaysia and Singapore. In reality, this operation was only able to blow up the MacDonald House and cause civilian and non-military casualties. In that incident, 20 fruit shops around the hotel were heavily damaged, 24 sedan vehicles were destroyed, 30 people died, and 35 people suffered mild and serious injuries. This incident is known as the MacDonald House bombing. Usman Harun was unable to escape from Singapore and was eventually arrested and sentenced to death by the Singaporean government. On 15 November 1975 (the Corps' 30th anniversary), Chief of Staff of the Navy issued a decree Skept/1831/XI/1975, which restored the Corps' name to its former name Korps Marinir.\\"NEWS STORY: Riwayat Marinir yang Pernah Dipisahkan dari TNI AL\\" (Corps Mariniers/ CM is the same word but using old spelling system in Indonesian.) Following this, a massive reorganization plan was implemented, followed up with another in 1984. There was a plan in 1999 to expand the Marine Corps from its strength of 13,000 troops. Based on this plan, every Marine Base would have three combat brigades: the Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery and would be supported by one Combat Support Regiment and one Administration Support Regiment. The expansion would create three Kormar bases: Surabaya for Eastern area command, Jakarta for Central area command, and Rate Island in Lampung for Western area command. The 1st Marine Brigade and all combat support and service support elements were consolidated in 2001 to form the 1st Marine Forces East (Pasmar 1). In 2004, the 2nd Marine Forces West (Pasmar 2) was established on the basis of the Marine Independent Brigade, now including the 2nd and 3rd Marine Brigades plus additional combat support and service support units. All these were a result of a massive modernization and expansion program that still continues today. A 3rd division-sized unit would be raised in 2018 as part of the expansion. Following a reorganisation introduced in March 2001, the corps consisted of the 1st Marine Corps Group (1,3,5 Battalions, 1st combat support regiment, and 1st administrative support regiment) at Surabaya and the Independent Marine Corps Brigade (2,4,6, battalions) at Jakarta (JDW 11 April 2001). The 8th Bn was formed in January 2004 and the 9th Bn was due to be formed in April 2004. They were planned to be part of a new group that would include the 7th Bn and support elements. (JDW 18 February 2004, p. 18) The same Jane's Defence Weekly story (Robert Karniol, 'Indonesia Reinforces Marines') said the Marine Corps leadership is reported to have ambitions for the service to expand to at least two full divisions. However, it was reported that the army was opposed, 'perhaps reflecting its leadership's concern over influence.' History of the beret color and Corps emblem (Gold Anchor and Black Kris) In 1958, the color purple was used by the Marine Corps (when it was still called KKO-AL) in the form of a ribbon as security code to hold landing operations in Padang, West Sumatera during Operation 17 August (as a response to the PPRI/Permesta revolt by several Army officers). The purple beret was the first time used by the 1st Battalion KKO AL (1st Marine Battalion) in Operation Alugoro in Aceh in August 1961. Furthermore, the beret was equipped with emblems. Initially, the Marine Corps emblem was a red pentagon with the symbol of a golden tricorn hat and two crossed swords in the middle, the beret was pushed to the left where the emblem was located. In 1962, coinciding with the 17th anniversary of KKO-AL (old name of Indonesian Marines), there was a change in the emblem with the introduction of the Keris Samudera sword emblem surrounded by a ribbon with the words \\"Jalesu Bhumyamca Jayamahe\\" and there is a writing bearing \\"Commando Corps\\" underneath. In between the Corps and Commando writings, there was a printed 1945 number indicating the Marine Corps year of foundation and below the traditional sword, blue wavy lines reflecting the wide Indonesian seas. The emblem was rectangular. In 1968, another change was made to print \\"Yellow\\" strips on the outer rings of the rectangular emblem. In 1975, with the issuance of Naval chief of staff order No. / 1831 / XI / 1975 dated 14 November 1975, the name of the Naval Operations Commando Corps (KKO-AL) changed its name to the Marine Corps in accordance with the name of the Corps Mariniers since 1945, and the waves were thus replaced by a blue lotus, its petals symbolizing amphibious operations and with a silhouette map of Indonesia in black at the center, the emblem now being circular and the gold \\"Commando Corps\\" ribbon with the lettering in black changed to that of \\"Marine Corps\\". In 1976, the Chief of Staff of the Navy issued Decree No. Skep / 2084 / X / 1976 dated 20 October 1976, on the Change of the Marine Corps Emblem to comply with the earlier decree on the return to the former name of the corps. The change was to add the Anchor as the background of the emblem (to signify the Corps as a constituent service of the Indonesian Navy), the \\"Marine Corps\\" ribbon was partially modified and the number \\"1945\\" remained at the center as before. The emblem is mounted on a beret provided that the center of the emblem base is located just above the outer end of the left eye's forehead, and thus is pushed to the right. So the official Corps emblem officially began to be used exactly on the 31st Marine Corps Birthday Parade in Jakarta on 15 November 1976 when new colours were awarded to the Corps. *The Naval Commando Corps (KKO-AL) Emblem was used in 1960-1962, Based on the KKO-AL Commandant's order dated 4 January 1961 Skept Number: 02/KP/KKO/1961. *The Naval Commando Corps (KKO-AL) Emblem was used in 1962-1976, Based on the Commander-in-Chief's command dated 10 September 1962 Skept Number: 5030.6. *The Marine Corps Emblem was Used in 1976‚ÄìPresent, Based on Chief of Staff of the Navy order dated 20 October 1976 Skept Number: Skep/2084/X/ 1976  Symbolism of the Gold Anchor and Black Kris  * Black Saber Kris Samudera (Saber of the Ocean) - honors the naval heritage of the early Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms, the Christian Kingdom of Larantuka and later Islamic sultanates that form part of modern-day Indonesia * Relief map on the blue Lotus - The relief map of Indonesia on the blue lotus flower symbolizes the national responsibility of the Corps in the defense of Indonesia through amphibious sea and ground combat operations * Gold Anchor with Black Chain - acknowledges the naval tradition of the Marines and their continual service as a specialty branch and service within the Indonesian Navy * Marine Corps Motto \\"Jalesu Bhumyamca Jayamahe\\" (Glorious On The Land And Sea) - The Sanskrit motto of the Corps reflects its duty to help the nation win victories in amphibious and conventional ground, air and sea operations, the gold scrolls which hold the motto also remember the cultural heritage of the country it defends Organization Indonesian Marines in parade formation Marine Corps Headquarters in Central Jakarta Indonesian Marines Taifib snipers USMC Marines US, Indonesia Marines train together during RIMPAC Exercise 2014 The order of battle of the Indonesian Marine Corps consists of three divisions which are the \\"Pasmar 1\\" (Marine Force I), \\"Pasmar 2\\" (Marine Force II), \\"Pasmar 3\\" (Marine Force III), one brigade and a Special operations unit (Taifib). Each Marine division oversees the Marine Infantry Brigade, the Marine Combat Support Regiment, the Marine Artillery Regiment and the Marine Cavalry Regiment. The 4th Marine Infantry Brigade covers 4 Marine Infantry Battalions plus other support units. The Marine Corps also maintain a special operations unit which are the Marine's Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion (Taifib) and also the joint Navy-Marine's counter-terrorism unit the \\"Jala Mengkara Detachment\\" (Denjaka). Organizational Command Structure 480px As a component Principal Command of the Indonesian Navy, the Marine Corps is structured into the following in accordance with the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 66/ 2019: Marine Force Entrance to the Marine Force I (PASMAR 1) base in Jakarta The Marine Force (Pasukan Marinir/ Pasmar) is the Marine Corps Executive Command. Pasmar's main operational missions are to foster the strength and capability of operational preparedness as the Navy's amphibious force in the framework of projection of power to the land by sea, coastal defense operations on strategic islands and other combat operations in accordance with the policy of the Chief of Staff of the Navy, Marine Corps Commandant and Indonesian National Armed Forces Commander.

Nikodemus Balla from the Communication and Electronics Battalion, Marine Combat Support Regiment, 2nd Marine Force, troubleshoots and restores Internet connection at the Indonesia Peace and Security Center in Sentul, West Java As of August 2018, there are three marine forces, which are led by one-star marine general, which are as follows: # Marine Force I (Pasmar 1), covering central Indonesia. It was established based on the Navy Chief of Staff decree No. 08/III/2001 dated 12 March 2001. The base is located in Sidoarjo, East Java. # Marine Force II (Pasmar 2), covering western Indonesia. It was established based on the Navy Chief of Staff decree 03/II/2004, dated 13 February 2004. The base is located in Jakarta. The 4th Marine Infantry Brigade, based in Lampung province, reports to the Commandant General of the Pasmar 2. # Marine Force III (Pasmar 3), is the latest Marine Corps Executive Command, created as part of the massive Armed Forces-wide expansion and modernization programs of the national government. Pasmar 3 was established based on the Navy Chief of Staff decree No. Kep/450/V/2018 dated 5 May 2018. The force HQ is located in Sorong, West Papua, and this force serves the eastern provinces of the republic. 4th Marine Infantry Brigade The 4th Brigade is a marine infantry brigade without support units, located in Bandar Lampung, Lampung, whose commander reports to the commanding general of the 2nd Marine division (Pasmar 2). It was raised in 2004 as part of the expansion of the Corps. With 4 battalions rather than the three of other brigades, it is also its largest brigade. # Brigade HQ # 4 Marine Infantry Battalions # Brigade Combat Support Battalion Taifib Batalion Intai Amfibi or Taifib is the Marine Corps' Amphibious reconnaissance Battalion, it has capabilities in Special reconnaissance (SR) and also in Airborne (Para-Commando). They were officially formed on 18 March 1961 as marine commandos and was first deployed in Irian Jaya (Papua) during Operation Trikora in April 1962. Starting from November 1971 it was called as Batalyon Intai Amphibi/ Yon Taifib or Amphibious Recon Battalion. To become a Taifib personnel, a candidate is selected from the Marine Corps who has already fulfilled the thorough mental and physical requirements, and at least has served the corps for two years. The certification of amphibious reconnaissance is notoriously difficult that the passing rate of these candidates in each class is only ten percent. Two battalions of this special unit are today in service within the 1st and 2nd Marine Forces, with a third being planned for formation. Denjaka Jala Mangkara Detachment personnel Detasemen Jala Mangkara or Denjaka is the special operations and counter- terrorism forces of the Indonesian Navy. This is a combined detachment formed from selected personnel of the Navy's Underwater Special Frogmen Unit (Kopaska) and the Marine Corps' Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion (Taifib). According to the directory of the Chief of Staff of the Navy, Denjaka is a Marine Corps task force under the Indonesian Navy, with the commandant of the Marine Corps holding responsibilities for general training, while specific training falls under the responsibilities of the chief of Armed Forces Strategic Intelligence Agency. Operational command falls directly under the commander of the National Armed Forces. Marine Corps Training Command The Marine Corps Training Command (Komando Latih Marinir) located in Grati, Pasuruan, East Java oversees the following: *Special Forces Training Center (Pusat Latihan Pasukan Khussus - Puslatsus) *Amphibious Forces Training Center (Pusat Latihan Pasukan Pendarat - Puslatpasrat) trains Marines in: #Amphibious operations #Shooting Coordination Exercise #Personnel Embarkation and De- embarkation Exercise #Materialistic courses *Marine Combat Training Centers (Pusat Pelatihan Tempur Marinir): **03 - in Grati, Pasuruan **04 - in Purboyo, Malang **05 - in Baluran, Situbondo **06 - in Antralina, Sukabumi **07 - in Lampon, Banyuwangi **08 - in Teluk Ratai, Lampung *Amphibious Landings and Combat Readiness Training Center (Pusat Latihan Pendarat Amfibi & Kesiapan Tempur) Independent units * Marine Corps Hospital, located in Cilandak, Jakarta * Marine Corps Bases in Jakarta, Surabaya and Sorong Insignias and Badges Note: Indonesia is not a member of NATO, so there is not an official equivalence between the Indonesian military ranks and those defined by NATO. The displayed parallel is approximate and for illustration purposes only. In the Marine Corps, as part of the Indonesian Navy, the rank structure consists of officers known as in Indonesian as \\"Perwira\\", NCOs (\\"Bintara\\") and enlisted personnel (\\"Tamtama\\".) While the Marine Corps wears the blue shoulder boards (for officers and WOs) and blue stripes (for enlisted personnel) or blue/gold chevrons (for NCOs) as a component service of the Navy its ranks follow those of the Indonesian Army, with the exception of a five-star rank. The highest rank obtainable in the Marine Corps is Major General, as it is the rank of Commandant of the Marine Corps. However, it is possible to be promoted into higher rank if appointed into a position in Navy or National Armed Forces HQ that requires 3-star rank or higher. Only few people managed to obtain rank of Lieutenant General, one of most notable person is Lt Gen (KKO) Ali Sadikin. Also there is Lieutenant General R. Hartono, which prominently acts as Vice Chief of Staff of the Navy.

It was founded in 1974 by Howard Phillips, who led until 2012 when he retired due to his health. He was replaced by current chairman, Peter J. Thomas. Most of the organization's $3.8 million budget comes from the efforts of New Right fundraising gurus Richard Viguerie and Bruce Eberle. The organization produced a weekly conservative television program, Conservative Roundtable, which was hosted by Mr. Phillips until his retirement. Howard Phillips is also President of The Conservative Caucus Research, Analysis and Education Foundation (TCCF), a 501(c)3 tax- deductible organization. Issues of focus TCC promotes an uncompromisingly conservative line on a wide range of issues. The following are a few it has emphasized: Foreign/military Immigration TCC opposes illegal immigration and legislation characterized by TCC as an amnesty for illegal immigrants, such as S. 2611. The organization supports measures to secure the Mexican border, including a complete fence. North American Union TCC opposes the North American Union (NAU), which the TCC sees as the merging of the United States with Mexico and Canada. TCC also opposes the NAFTA Superhighway which it sees as facilitating smuggling, terrorist infiltration, and bypassing American port workers by using cheaper Mexican ports. TCC held a news conference on October 25, 2006 announcing formation of a coalition to oppose the NAU, which was featured by Lou Dobbs on CNN. The NAU is connected to the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP). TCC is a founder of the 'Coalition to Block the North American Union', and held a news conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in August 2007 at the time of the SPP summit in Montebello, Quebec with the leaders of the United States, Mexico and Canada. Participating were representatives of many United States organizations as well as Connie Fogal, the Leader of the Canadian Action Party. The news conference was covered by Fox, CTV, Reuters, the Wall Street Journal and other U.S. and Canadian media outlets. Trade TCC is opposed in principle to what is called excessive or unlimited free trade, seeing such policies as being dangerous to the economic well-being of the American middle class, the manufacturing sector, and of the United States as a whole. TCC also specifically opposes various trade treaties, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and others as being threats to US sovereignty. Cold War Throughout the Cold War, TCC took a strong anti- communist stance, favoring active U.S. involvement around the world to undermine or overthrow pro-Soviet governments and bolster anti-Soviet allies. TCC often voiced concerns that the U.S. and its allies had fallen behind the Eastern bloc in the arms race to a position of military inferiority, not merely quantitatively but qualitatively as well. China TCC sees the People's Republic of China as a major military threat to U.S. security and interests. It suspects China of seeking to gain strategic control of the Panama Canal through a front company, Hutchison Whampoa. It also opposes Permanent Normal Trade relations with China and China's membership in the World Trade Organization. Panama Canal TCC opposed the Panama Canal Treaties which transferred control of the Panama Canal from the U.S. to Panama. To this day, it lobbies to return a limited American military presence to protect the Canal due to its strategic importance in trade and defense. TCC also fears that the Canal is vulnerable to terrorism. United Nations TCC supports a U.S. withdrawal from the UN, perceiving the organization as having ambitions to be a world government hostile to US interests and sovereignty, and which routinely votes against American interests. Domestic Constitutionalism TCC supports strict constructionism and original intent when it comes to constitutional interpretation. In its view, the majority of federal agencies and activities are unconstitutional. Through its \\"Constitutional Education Program\\", TCC seeks to educate citizens on the Constitution and its importance in protecting the liberty of all Americans. TCC sponsors an annual 'Constitution Day' educational event on the anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution (September 17, 1789), which in 2006 was televised on C-SPAN. Health care A major focus of TCC activism in 2009 and 2010 was opposing President Obama's health care reform bills and any greater government involvement in health care. Following passage, TCC is campaigning for the repeal of the enacted reform bill. Washington, DC Congressional seat TCC opposes efforts to create a full voting seat in the House of Representatives for the District of Columbia, based upon the Constitutional provisions that only states can have Congressional representation, and the Founding Fathers' intention to keep the nation's capital a neutral territory where all states may meet without fear of undue influence. TCC also opposed efforts to make the city into a state. Taxes/IRS TCC favors abolishing the income tax and replacing it with a low revenue tariff. This would eliminate the need for the Internal Revenue Service. Social issues TCC is strongly anti-abortion and opposes gay marriage. It favors school prayer and championed former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore for his stance favoring the display of the Ten Commandments.

Cartoons Pugsley is depicted as a devious, young, brilliant boy in Charles Addams's original cartoons. He is often shown releasing sailboats in the park with other children, except his boats were more macabre in nature. TV shows Pugsley is the oldest child of Morticia and Gomez Addams. He is a young boy (his age is given as eight years old in the pilot episode but is changed to 10 years old in the second episode) who is almost always seen wearing a striped T-shirt and shorts. Originally unnamed (as were all of the family members), the character who was apparently the prototype for Pugsley first appeared in the Charles Addams cartoons in The New Yorker during the 1930s. In this first incarnation, he was portrayed as a deviant child with a vicious nature, shown committing deplorable acts with his sister. In all incarnations, he is overweight. In the television series, Pugsley usually eats over five pieces of cake at birthday parties. When the characters were given names for the television series, he was originally going to be called \\"Pubert\\" (a derivation of the word puberty, possibly a reflection of his age) but it was rejected as it sounded too sexual, and the name Pugsley was chosen instead. (The name Pubert was later used when Gomez and Morticia have a third child in the film Addams Family Values.) The Lurch Files' Addams Family Tree lists Pugsley's middle name as Pubert, probably as an homage to Charles Addams' original suggestion. In the American television series, Pugsley is played by child actor Ken Weatherwax. This incarnation of the character is more jovial and inventive; he displays outlandish engineering skills, including the invention of a disintegrator gun, an anti-gravity gun, and other devices. He and Gomez created a computer named Whizzo and a robot named Smiley (played by Robby the Robot). Pugsley and his younger sister Wednesday often play together, rarely exhibiting signs of sibling rivalry; they share an interest in spiders, dynamite, guillotines, and other dangerous \\"toys.\\" In an early episode, \\"Morticia and the Psychiatrist\\", the rest of the family is concerned that Pugsley is engaging in behavior they consider \\"odd\\": wearing a Boy Scout uniform, playing with a puppy, etc. When sent to a psychiatrist, Pugsley tells of boyhood incidents involving hangings, machine guns, and grenades, with no clue that others might find these accounts unusual. In most incarnations of the character, Pugsley had an unusual hobby of stealing road signs, which he used to adorn the walls and door of his bedroom. This may have evolved from an original Addams cartoon in which, rather than road signs, he would steal and decorate his room with cautionary signs, such as high voltage and shallow water signs, thus leading others into danger. He also has a pet octopus named Aristotle. In the 1970s, there was an animated series about the family, in which Pugsley was voiced by an actress Jodie Foster. Foster voiced that same character in an episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies. In the second animated series, Pugsley was voiced by Jeannie Elias. In the 1977 TV movie, Ken Weatherwax played a grown-up Pugsley, who has become a witch-doctor. In the interval between the original TV series and this movie, his parents have had two more children, who look just like the original Pugsley and Wednesday. He is known as Pericles Addams in Spanish- speaking countries and in Brazil (Portuguese) as \\"Feioso\\" (Ugly). The 1998 series The New Addams Family features Pugsley played by Vancouver native Brody Smith. He is essentially the same as the original 1960s incarnation; however, the influence of director John Bell's namesake Charlie 'Edge' Bell is undeniable. Also, he is portrayed as younger than Wednesday. Film versions Wednesday (left) and Pugsley in The Addams Family film (1991). In the film The Addams Family and its sequel, Addams Family Values, Pugsley is played by Jimmy Workman. He acts as an unwitting accomplice to his older sister, Wednesday, who makes attempts to inflict lethal harm upon him - although he has returned the favor on occasion. In The Addams Family, Pugsley and Wednesday open a lemonade stand, but their drinks are toxic, and cause Lurch to spit flames when he tries it. In Addams Family Values, Wednesday and Pugsley are sent to Camp Chippewa, a summer camp, where they are forced to participate in a Thanksgiving-themed play entitled A Turkey Called Brotherhood. Pugsley is cast as a dancing turkey, and leads the children in a chorus of \\"Eat Us\\"; He is later seen assisting Wednesday in overthrowing the camp counselors and setting fire to the grounds. In the film Addams Family Reunion, Pugsley (now played by Jerry Messing) behaves (for the most part) similarly to his previous two film incarnations. At the Addams Family's family reunion he falls for a young girl named Gina (played by Haylie Duff). According to Pugsley, his name means \\"stomach pump\\" in Bulgarian. In the Broadway musical The Addams Family, Pugsley is played by Adam Riegler as the younger sibling, around eleven years old, seven years younger than 18-year-old Wednesday (played by Krysta Rodriguez). In the national tour (2011-2012), Pugsley was played by Patrick D. Kennedy (u.s. Jason Testa). Ethan Wexler replaced Jason Testa in March 2012. Finn Wolfhard voices Pugsley in the 2019 animated movie. Javon ‚ÄúWanna‚Äù Walton will replace Wolfhard as the voice of Pugsley in the 2021 sequel.

The play is set in San Francisco, California, in the 1960s. Plot overview The story is a love triangle, mixed with politics. Andy and Norman are roommates and radicals who barely make a living working on their magazine, Fallout, which is dedicated to fighting \\"the system\\" in America. Sophie, a former Olympic swimmer, is an all- American Southern girl who moves into the apartment next door. What is love at first sight (or, as the play has it, first smell) for Norman is not reciprocated. Norman's obsession with Sophie causes Andy to hire her just to sustain the magazine's operation. Then Sophie falls for Andy, though they are at odds politically, threatening to destroy the magazine and the men's friendship. History and reception Simon said that he based the play on a \\"spirited political conversation he overheard between author Paddy Chayefsky and Rene Carpenter, the wife of astronaut Scott Carpenter.\\" While it features Simon's lively comic style‚Äîstill on display on Broadway in Barefoot in the Park and The Odd Couple when The Star-Spangled Girl debuted‚Äîit was not well received. Louis Botto and Robert Viagas called the play \\"a stultifying evening of vapidity...\\". Critic Walter Kerr's review in The New York Times determined, \\"Neil Simon, your friendly neighborhood gagman, hasn't had an idea for a play this season, but he's gone ahead and written one anyway.\\" In an interview, Simon said that The Star-Spangled Girl \\"was written 'from an emotional identity rather than personal identity...I knew this one didn't have the body of the others. I knew it never had a chance to be a powerful comedy....I didn't make it'\\". Production The Star-Spangled Girl opened on Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre on December 21, 1966 and closed on August 5, 1967 after 261 performances. The production was directed by playwright George Axelrod. The original cast featured Anthony Perkins as Andy, Richard Benjamin as Norman and Connie Stevens as Sophie. The scenic design was by Oliver Smith, the lighting was by Jean Rosenthal and the costumes were by Ann Roth. In an interview, Neil Simon was asked whether The Star-Spangled Girl would have been better with direction by Mike Nichols. Simon replied: \\"Yes. He would have given the actors a different attitude; we would have gone much more for reality than the superficial comedy that came out. That's not to knock George Axelrod....He couldn't do it because he was busy with 'Virginia Woolf' but it isn't true that he advised me not to do it; as a matter of fact he came to Philadelphia, and he liked it. He gave me some advice on it which helped.\\" Film The play was adapted into a movie in 1971. Jerry Paris directed and the screenplay was by Arnold Margolin and Jim Parker. The cast starred Tony Roberts as Andy, Todd Susman as Norman and Sandy Duncan as Amy (renamed from Sophie). According to tcm.com, \\"The film received almost universally poor notices.\\" The New York Times reviewer wrote: \\"Time and Hollywood have not done wonders for his exuberant but still essentially lightweight comedy....The uninspired adaptation of Simon's antic is a basically contrived affair that may get a share of chuckles but not many hearty laughs.\\" The movie also features Davy Jones singing \\"Girl,\\" which he also sang in an episode of the television series The Brady Bunch References External links *Internet Broadway Database Category:1966 plays Category:Broadway plays Category:American plays adapted into films Category:Plays by Neil Simon Category:Plays set in California Category:San Francisco in fiction ","title":"The Star-Spangled Girl"},{"id":"4484272","title":"LC Per√∫"},{"id":"4484276","text":"Stuart Moulthrop (born 1957 in Baltimore, Maryland, United States) is an innovator of electronic literature and hypertext fiction, both as a theoretician and as a writer.

She was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but eventually the family ended up in a small town in northeastern Pennsylvania. She graduated from the University of Scranton in 1982. Campbell Bartoletti began her career as an eighth-grade English teacher before deciding to pursue writing in earnest. Seeing her student write and create original work, she was inspired to create her own. In connection with her students, Susan said that \\"I felt immense satisfaction in watching my students grow as writers. I wanted to practice what I preached, so I joined a writers group and got serious about my own writing.\\" She sold her first short story in 1989. Three years later, in 1992, Campbell Bartoletti published her first picture book, Silver at Night. She held a rigid routine, waking early in the morning in order to write before she left to teach. In 1997, she turned to writing full-time. Since then, her works have received a number of awards, including the NCTE Orbis Pictus Award for Nonfiction, the SCBWI Golden Kite Award for Nonfiction, the Jane Addams Children's Book Award, and the Newbery Honor in 2006. She teaches writing classes at a number of MA and MFA programs, among them Spalding University in Louisville, Kentucky, and Hollins University in Roanoke, Virginia.

He was born in Asheville, North Carolina but raised in Washington, D.C.'s Maryland suburbs. He was an exceptionally bright child with parents who were able to afford a series of costly prep schools, and he attended Yale University. He returned to Maryland upon receiving his bachelor's degree and was diagnosed with schizophrenia following an LSD-induced psychotic episode. In the 1970s, he formed his own alternative rock band (including musicians such as tenor saxophonist Ron Holloway) and an ensemble titled Crying Out Loud. Mackenzie's group was ultimately billed as Root Boy Slim and the Sex Change Band and The Rootettes. The band cultivated a dedicated fan base, largely confined to the Washington metropolitan area. MacKenzie died in his sleep in his home in Orlando, Florida at age 48 and is buried in Fletcher, North Carolina. He was inducted into the Washington Area Music Association Hall of Fame in 2004. Background MacKenzie was an intelligent yet incorrigible youth, who was asked to leave several private D.C.-area prep schools, including Sidwell Friends School. He finally found his niche at Saint James School in Hagerstown, Maryland, a boarding school, where along with his studies, he played varsity football. He was accepted to and attended Yale University, majoring in African American studies, and graduated in 1967. He was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, where his fraternity brothers included future President George W. Bush. MacKenzie was a year older than Bush. While at Yale, MacKenzie formed a band with classmate and fraternity brother Bob Greenlee, who was captain of Yale's football team. The band was named Prince La La and the Midnight Creepers. MacKenzie's growing dislike of authority and inner inclination to play pranks and his love of shock value expanded. Band members wore ermine capes, silver lam√© hot pants and boasted that they were never invited for return engagements. The year after MacKenzie and Greenlee graduated, they returned to the DKE house during Yale's homecoming. Bush, who since their departure had become president of DKE, threw them out and banned them from the house. After graduation, MacKenzie drove an ice cream truck in Washington, D.C. One day he suffered a psychotic break after a particularly high dose of LSD, and he climbed over the White House fence. The United States Secret Service apprehended him as he ran up the White House lawn. He told the officers he was \\"looking for the center of universe.\\" They hauled him off to St. Elizabeths Hospital, the largest long-term mental hospital that serves Washington, D.C. That incident led to a diagnosis of schizophrenia, for which MacKenzie was medicated for the rest of his life. Sex Change Band Mackenzie adopted the stage name of Root Boy Slim, and formed a blues rock band, which he dubbed \\"Root Boy Slim and the Sex Change Band.\\" His backup singers were called the Rootettes. The band members were stridently different than most club fare. Root Boy was fat, had greasy hair, and almost always seemed to be in a drug- or alcohol-induced stupor. The band was a fixture in the mid-Atlantic blues/rock scene, and favored a mix of Memphis-style boogie rock/blues. Root Boy and company traveled the club circuit, until a self- produced recording caught the ear of some A&R; representatives at Warner Bros. Records. That song was called \\"Christmas At Kmart\\" and it landed the band a $250,000 contract with Warner Bros. That tune and the follow-up LP demonstrated Root and the band's penchant for writing tunes relating to pop- culture. Their most famous recording was \\"Boogie 'Til You Puke\\" from the debut album Root Boy Slim and the Sex Change Band with the Rootettes (Warner Bros. Records, 1978), which was produced by Gary Katz, best known as the producer of Steely Dan recordings from 1972 through 1980. The debut album also featured the songs \\"I Used To Be a Radical\\", \\"I'm Not Too Old For You\\", and \\"(You Broke My) Mood Ring.\\" Most of the songs were written by MacKenzie, guitarist Ernie Lancaster, and bassist Bob Greenlee. The lyrics often satirized society and mixed in autobiographical elements from MacKenzie's storied life. Warner mismarketed the LP, and the band found themselves without a label‚Äîbut not without having had a European tour, in which Root Boy became enamored with his forefathers' homeland: Scotland. The band also performed the song \\"Boogie 'Til You Puke\\" in the Party Doll Lounge on 42nd St in New York in Mr. Mike's Mondo Video (1979), a satire of the Italian produced exploitation \\"shockumentary\\" Mondo Cane (1962). The film was produced and directed by Michael O'Donoghue, the famed Saturday Night Live head writer, and also featured appearances from Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Laraine Newman, Gilda Radner, and Sid Vicious among others. During the same year, the band played a date at the Varsity Grill's Back Room in College Park, Maryland, which was one of the main bars popular with students at the University of Maryland, College Park. A riot broke out in the bar and outside on U.S. Route 1, which later led the College Park City Council to ban the band from future engagements in College Park. The ban was lifted in 1980, and Root Boy and crew triumphantly returned in a concert in the University's Ritchie Coliseum. Miles Copeland III's record label, Illegal Records was a spin-off from I.R.S. Records, and Copeland signed the band and they produced their second LP, ZOOM on I.R.S. in the U.S., with distribution on Illegal Records in the UK. Despite the use of strong marketing efforts, the LP was just as commercially unsuccessful as the previous one, with the band being dropped by the label. Despite their disappointment, Root Boy Slim And The Sex Change Band continued playing the bar circuit along the Atlantic Seaboard and released four more LPs: Dog Secrets on Congressional Records, Don't Let This Happen to You and Left for Dead for Kingsnake Records, and Root Six on Naked Language Records. Eventually, most of the original band members went their separate ways, reuniting mostly for recording projects. For nightclub performances, Root Boy was backed by a series of other bands, including Ron Holloway and Cryin' Out Loud, New Hope for the Criminally Insane, Capital Offense (featuring Wayne Tomlinson, Tommy Lepson, Tim Biery, Ron Holloway and Dominic Vigliotti), Barbecue Juiceheads, and the Humans. Root Boy Slim and the Sex Change Band's fifth anniversary took place in 1982 at the PsycheDelly in Bethesda, Maryland, and featured home movies of Root Boy, who wore an orange and white checkered 7-Eleven clerk's shirt and a white 10-gallon cowboy hat throughout the concert. The band's 10th anniversary concert took place at The Roxy, a club in downtown Washington. A line formed hours prior to that show and the club's three levels were standing room only. By the time the fourth set began, there were at least 25 musicians on the stage who had recorded or played clubs with Root Boy during his career. That show was also the debut of the \\"Rich White Republican,\\" a biting satiric attack on Republicans that prophesied the eventual election of George H.W. Bush to the White House. The band sold bumper stickers that read \\"Root Boy Slim owes me money.\\" Death On June 8, 1993, MacKenzie died in his sleep in his home in Orlando, Florida. After his death, the Washington Area Music Association held a memorial concert at The Bayou on K Street in Georgetown. Root Boy fans traveled from as far away as California to pay homage to \\"The Lenny Bruce of the Blues.\\" Slim's final resting place is in a grave beside his father's in Calvary Church Cemetery on Hendersonville Road in Fletcher, North Carolina, just south of Asheville. His grave is in the cemetery's northwest corner. Discography *Root Boy Slim and the Sex Change Band with the Rootettes (Warner Bros.

Cultural practices  Cherries of the Rio Grande are easy to grow, requiring relatively little maintenance for the growth of healthy, productive plants. Fruit size and quality depends to a large extent on proper nourishment and an adequate water supply at the time of fruit development. When first planted, they need a complete fertilizer in a 1-1-1 ratio, such as 6-6-6, that also contains magnesium. Start with no more than 1/4 pound at monthly or bi-monthly intervals, increasing the rates commensurate with growth. If iron deficiency in calcareous soils is a problem, this element should be applied as Sequestrene 138, injected or drenched into the soil when needed. Nutritional sprays to supply other minor elements should also be applied as needed. After the tree has matured, a fertilizer such as 8-3-9 with 5% MgO is more appropriate. The plants should be supplied with adequate water at all times but especially during bloom and fruit development. The cherry of the Rio Grande has fairly good drought tolerance. The cherry of the Rio Grande requires very little pruning to make an attractive tree and it is seldom pruned to make a hedge.  Blooming habits  In Florida, the cherry of the Rio Grande starts blooming in the first part of March. The flowering season lasts several months, occasionally until May. The flowers are white.  Fruiting habits  The fruit ripens on the bush 3 weeks after the blossom. It is red to deep purple about 1 inch diameter with a sweet cherry taste. The fruit can also be used for jelly, jam or juice.  Propagation  This species is generally propagated by seeds. Seeds usually germinate in less than a month, but can take 5 years to produce. The better selections can be veneer grafted, or reproduced by cuttings, although grafting has a low success rate.

Early life Mara, the son of Elizabeth (n√©e Harris) and John Mara, a policeman, of Irish descent, was born into poverty on New York City's Lower East Side. At the age of 13, he quit school in order to find work to support his mother. His first job was as an usher in a theater.Gottehrer. pg. 24 He then worked as a newsboy selling newspapers on the streets. This job brought him into contact with many of New York's bookmakers (or bookies). He soon became a runner for the bookies, earning five percent of the bets he collected and receiving tips from winners when he delivered their cash. By age 18, he was an established bookmaker himself. New York Giants Formation of the Giants In 1925, the NFL was in need of a franchise in a large city that could be used to showcase the league. NFL President Joseph Carr traveled to New York to offer boxing promoter Billy Gibson a franchise. Gibson had owned the New York Brickley Giants, the NFL's last attempt to put a team in New York. While Gibson turned the offer down, he referred Carr to his friend Tim Mara. While Mara did not know much about football, Mara's friend, Dr. Harry March, did. March, a former physician for the Canton Bulldogs of the pre-NFL \\"Ohio League\\" and the future author of the first professional football history book Pro Football: Its Ups and Downs, soon became the club's first secretary. This backing led Mara to purchase the NFL franchise for New York at a cost of $500‚Äìabout $7,124.97 in 2018. Mara and March even signed Jim Thorpe to play several half games in order to boost attendance. However many of the New York sports fans still took to college football and stayed away from the pro sport. During the Giants' first season, attendance was so poor that Mara lost over $40,000. To tap into New York's college football fans, Mara tried to sign ex-college football superstar Red Grange only to find that he already was a member of the Chicago Bears. However still looking for a way to cash in on Grange's popularity, Mara scheduled a game against the Bears to be played at the Polo Grounds. The gate receipts totalled $143,000 for that one game against Grange and the Bears, and Mara recovered all of his losses for the 1925 season. Battle with the AFL and first NFL Championship In 1926, Grange and his manager, C. C. Pyle, formed the first American Football League with a franchise in New York, the Yankees, to compete with the Giants. At the same time, Giants coach Bob Folwell and star tackle Century Milstead, left to join the AFL's Philadelphia Quakers. This led Mara to increase the salaries of all his players by $50 a game to prevent them from leaving the Giants, too. He also signed many players to full-season contracts. Mara suffered $60,000 in financial losses that season. However all but four of the AFL franchises finished the 1926 season. Mara then challenged the AFL champion Philadelphia Quakers to a game and they accepted. In the first inter-league post-season confrontation, the seventh-place Giants defeated the AFL's champion, 31-0. The AFL folded soon after. By now, Mara was now willing to admit the Yankees into the NFL, as the only survivor of the defunct AFL. He even allowed the team to play its home games at Yankee Stadium. However, Mara was able to dictate the Yankees' schedule. When the Giants were in the Polo Grounds, the Yankees were to be on the road. The next year, the Giants went 11-1-1 and won their first NFL championship. At the end of the 1928 season, Pyle turned his Yankees' franchise over to Mara. In 1929, Dan Blaine, the owner of the Staten Island Stapletons, applied for an NFL franchise. However, he first needed permission from Mara to set up his franchise, because Staten Island was within Mara's exclusive territory. But Mara actually had an extra franchise since the Yankees folded after the 1928 season, so the franchise again went back to Mara and he passed those franchise's rights on to Staten Island. Among his many business interests, Tim Mara was a bookmaker. Here he is pictured at the Jamaica Race Track in 1934 Takeover of the Wolverines In 1929, Mara was looking for a player who might approach Grange in fan appeal. He saw Benny Friedman of the Detroit Wolverines as the best option available. When he couldn't make a deal for Friedman, Mara simply bought the entire Detroit franchise for $10,000. For the next few years Mara had ultimate ownership of three NFL franchises; however, he never interfered with the management of any of the teams that operated under his leases. Great Depression era During the Great Depression in 1930, New York Mayor Jimmy Walker approached Mara about playing a charity exhibition game, which he quickly agreed to do. The Giants defeated the Notre Dame All-Stars, which included the legendary Four Horsemen. The Giants easily outscored Notre Dame, 21-0. As a result of the game, Mara and the Giants raised $115,153 for the New York City Unemployment Fund. Battles with other rival leagues In 1936 and 1937, Mara successfully battled for New York's pro football market against the Brooklyn Tigers and the New York Yankees of the second American Football League. He also successfully outlasted the New York Yankees of the third third American Football League. However, from 1946 to 1949, Mara engaged in an all-out war with the All-America Football Conference. Mara and the Giants were faced with two AAFC opponents in the New York City area, the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers. Again Mara fought hard for New York's pro football fanbase and eventually won. When the two leagues partially merged after the 1949 season, Mara demanded and got the best players from the combined New York- Brooklyn franchise that had operated in 1949. Legacy Mara died in 1959 at the age of 71. His vast contributions to the NFL were recognized with his 1963 election to the charter class of 17 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Family Mara left the Giants to his sons, Jack and Wellington Mara. Wellington is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame alongside his father. His grandson Timothy J. Mara later was part-owner of the Giants, his other grandson John Mara is currently the Giants' president and part owner. Only the Chicago Bears (owned by the Halas-McCaskey family since 1921) have been in the hands of one family longer than the Giants. Tim's great-granddaughters Rooney and Kate Mara are actresses.

Fleet Band Activities (FBA), formerly the Navy Music Program (NMP), is the central management office for nine active- duty fleet bands of the United States Navy. It is located at Naval Support Activity Mid-South in Millington, Tennessee. FBA has the responsibility of coordinating the assignment and distribution of personnel, equipment and funding to the worldwide activities of navy military bands. It also is responsible for managing the application and audition process for potential navy musicians. Personnel from the FBA work directly with the Bureau of Naval Personnel to meet our musician requirements for the fleet.  History of navy bands  The earliest pieces of military music in the United States Navy was the Shantyman's Song, which often helped in boosting the morale of sailors and developing a culture based on shipboard life. Later came trumpeters, drummers and fifers who were carried on the early frigates to sound calls, give general orders, and perform at funerals and other ceremonies. They eventually gained a role as a separate section of the crew on many Navy vessels. Shore-based bands in the 19th century led to the creation of the Naval Academy Band, which grew in importance during the American Civil War. Other band units afloat and ashore played a major role in promoting the morale of sailors and civilians alike. At the start of World War I many civilian musicians left their famous orchestras and joined the Navy as well as other services of the United States Armed Forces, using their trade to contribute to the war effort. MUS1, a 45-piece regimental band led notable by James Benton Parsons, was composed of the first blacks to serve in the modern Navy at rank higher than messman.At the end of World War II, Parsons went to law school and later became a United States federal judge. The first of a series of fleet music schools were established in 1903 in Virginia in an effort to improve the training and performance of navy bands.http://navymusicians.org/site/mobile?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnavymusicians.org%2FNavy_Music_History.html#2739 B-1 was replaced at Manana in October 1945 as its men mustered out and returned to the states by a 17-piece band that included future jazz great John Coltrane.Alex Albright, The Forgotten First: B-1 and the Integration of the Modern Navy.

Fleet Bands outside the continental U.S.   Pacific Fleet Band  The Pacific Fleet Band was formed coming out of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Prior to that, Navy Bands have been stationed in Hawaii either on ships home ported at Pearl Harbor, or attached to Navy shore installations at Pearl Harbor, Barbers Point and Waikiki. From 1959 to 1964, the Pacific Fleet Band operated from a building at Supply Base Pearl Harbor, just inside the Halawa Gate. It moved to its current facility in 1967. Since its establishment, it has traveled extensively in representing the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet, as well as the United States Pacific Fleet as a whole. It has performed at engagements in Pusan and Seoul, Guam, the Philippines and Okinawa.

Support Unit  The Repair Division was established to provide the material support in the operation of Fleet bands both afloat and ashore. It comprises professional Navy musicians and civilians who operate out of Millington, Tennessee. It is responsible for many administrative tasks, not in the least of which is the shipping and receiving of equipment to/from bands fleet-wide. It is also responsible for maintaining inventory in excess of 50,000 items.  School of Music  Located aboard the Naval Amphibious Base in Norfolk, Virginia, the Naval School of Music provides specialized training for selected personnel of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. It is also the first institution musicians attend following basic training. Graduates of the Navy School of Music go on to serve throughout the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps as members of the military bands of these three branches. In June 1935, the Navy School of Music was opened, operating in conjunction with the United States Navy Band until becoming an independent entity in 1942. Students enrolled at the School during this era graduated as complete ensembles‚Äîtransferring as a unit to serve aboard ships in the U.S. Fleet. Unit Band No. 22, for example, was deployed to USS Arizona‚Äîultimately to be counted among the first casualties during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. After more than a decade of operating as a Navy-specific institution, the School received group of 15 enlisted Marines and, following negotiations between Secretary of the Army Frank Pace and the Chief of Naval Personnel Admiral John W. Roper, Army students began being enrolled in January 1951. On 13 December 1951, the first women to graduate from the Naval School of Music received their diplomas.

Founded in 1551 near Barcelona, Spain, it is the oldest company in the country and one of the oldest wineries worldwide.  History  Gates leading to Codorn√≠u winery The Codorn√≠u family‚Äôs wine business goes back to the middle of the 16th century. A document of that period states that the family had several machines and implements relating to the wine industry. In 1659 Anna Codorn√≠u married Miquel Ravent√≥s and the families, each with a long wine tradition, were united. Years later, in 1872, Josep Ravent√≥s produced cava for the first time in Spain using the ‚Äútraditional method‚Äù and established a completely new industry in the Alt Pened√®s region. The Codorn√≠u cellars at Sant Sadurn√≠ d'Anoia were built on the orders of Manuel Ravent√≥s between the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century (1895-1915). He chose the renowned Catal√°n architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, to design the facility. At that time Codorn√≠u was producing about 100,000 bottles of cava per year, and the size of the new structure seemed overly grandiose. The location of the winery, then some distance from the road and the railway line, was also unusual for the time. Manuel Ravent√≥s, however, was insistent that the family winery should be close to the vineyard as he was aware that such proximity would be the key to improving the quality of the wines. Nowadays, Codorn√≠u continues to control the production process of all its cavas from vineyard planting to finished product. The winery has the most modern installations and the very latest equipment.‚Äù Awards and honors In 1976, the Codorn√≠u cellars at Sant Sadurn√≠ d'Anoia were declared a \\"National Monument of Historical and Artistic Interest\\" by King Juan Carlos I.

The band consists of US Navy career musicians. The band is required to blend tradition and change into a wide variety of musical styles. The Naval Academy Band is one of two Navy premier bands. The Washington DC Navy Band and the Academy Band is staffed based on auditions not limited to military personnel. Winners of the auditions are required to attend boot camp. Upon completion they are awarded the rank of E-6, Petty Officer First Class. They have been granted an exemption to wear the same uniform as a Chief Petty Officer to maintain a consistent appearance. The crest on their hats are a musician's lyre. Their career can be entirely at this one duty station. The Directors are the only officers and the only members who are subject to transfers. The band has been termed \\"the Chiefs Band\\" by midshipmen to distinguish it from the Naval Academy Drum and Bugle Corps, which is staffed by midshipmen. Performances The United States Naval Academy Band leads a column of Midshipmen on military parade before dignitaries on Worden Field, advances into Navy/Marine Corps Stadium for a contest in American football, escorts a fallen shipmate to his final resting place, or represents the Navy and Naval Academy on ‚ÄúMain Street, USA‚Äù in their Memorial Day celebration.

Acworth was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge. During the reign of Queen Mary, he travelled in France and Italy, where he studied civil law. In 1560, he was public orator at Cambridge; and, in the following year, was created doctor of laws. In 1562, he was admitted as an advocate in the Arches Court; and afterwards lived in the family of archbishop Parker, who gave him a prebend of North Muskham in Southwell. In 1567, he was vicar-general to Robert Horne, bishop of Winchester; and, in 1575, the archbishop of Canterbury permitted him to hold the rectory of Ellington, alias Wroughton, in the Diocese of Sarum, with any benefice. In 1576, he was appointed master of the faculties, and judge of the prerogative court, in Ireland, after he had been turned out of all the situations he held in England, because of his dissolute conduct. The date of his death is uncertain. Acworth wrote: Orationem encomiasticam in restitutione Buceri et Fagii, printed in Hist. Buceri, Argentor, 1562 (re Martin Bucer & Paul Fagius); the preface to Book II of Bucer's works, fol. Basil, 1577; De visibili Romanarchia, contra Nic. Sanderi Monarchiam, London, 1622. This was written while he lived with archbishop Parker, and probably at his instigation; Nicolas Sanderus had written Monarchia.

Its fossils have been found in the upper Two Medicine Formation in the present-day U.S. state of Montana, in Campanian age rock layers that have been dated to 74.3 million years ago.Ryan, M. J., Evans, D. C., Currie, P. J., Brown, C. M., & Brinkman, D. (2012). New leptoceratopsids from the Upper Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada. Cretaceous Research, 35: 69-80. Discovery and species Restoration Prenoceratops was first described by Brenda J. Chinnery in 2004. It is unusual in that it is the only basal neoceratopsian known from a bonebed. Prenoceratops species include P. pieganensis (type). Classification Prenoceratops belonged to the Ceratopsia (which name is derived from Ancient Greek, meaning 'horned face'), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks, which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period. It is closely related to Leptoceratops, which it antedates by several million years. It is characterized by a lower, more sloping head than that of Leptoceratops. Diet Prenoceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were \\"geographically limited on the landscape\\", and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. It would have used its sharp ceratopsian beak to bite off the leaves or needles.

Early life Robert George Brett was born on November 16, 1851 in Strathroy, Adelaide Township, Middlesex County, Canada West (Ontario), the eldest of four children to James Brett (b. 1821) and Catherine Mallon (b. 1825). Brett was well educated, attending Strathroy Grammar School and later the University of Toronto and attaining his medical degree. He completed his postgraduate work in New York City, Philadelphia and later in 1894, Vienna, Austria. He was married in 1873 to Louise T. Hungerford and had four children, all four of whom predeceased their parents (their eldest daughter, Genevieve, died as a four-month-old infant in October 1881 and is buried at Arkona). Medical career In 1874 he located in the small village of Arkona, Ontario, where he even served a term as village Reeve. Although it has been stated that Brett moved to Manitoba in 1880 he and his family were listed in the 1881 census in Arkona. In any case in the early 1880s he helped found the Manitoba Medical College and sat as a board member on the University of Manitoba. In 1883 he moved to Banff, District of Alberta. He worked as a physician at the Banff Sanitarium, which he founded. He later served as a senior surgeon in Banff at Brett Hospital. Brett was a strong proponent of standardized examination and licensing in the medical profession, and in 1909 proposed the four western provinces form a licensing body for medical practitioners in the West. Political career In 1888 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories as a member of the electoral district for Red Deer. His nomination had taken place without his knowledge while he was on a trip in central Canada. He became a de facto leader of the government as chairman of the Lieutenant- Governor's Advisory Council. Robert Brett had a rivalry with longtime member Frederick Haultain. Due to the limited role of the Advisory Council, Brett and other members tendered their resignations on October 29 and November 9, 1889. Brett was returned by acclimation in the 1891 Northwest Territories general election as the member for Banff and elected in 1894. In 1898 Robert Brett became the first Leader of the Official Opposition during a time in which the territorial legislature made a transition to party politics. In the 1898 Northwest Territories general election Brett was opposed by Arthur Sifton in Banff and lost the election by a small margin. Election day returns showed Sifton with a plurality of thirty-six votes, but by the time contested ballots were dealt with this had turned into a majority of two votes for Brett. Brett contested the results of the election on grounds of \\"irregularities\\" in accordance with Section 106 of The Territories Elections Ordinance. Judge Charles Rouleau of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories, in the jurisdiction of Northern Alberta, found in favour of Brett by two votes. Sifton appealed the decision, and a by-election was scheduled for June 27, 1899. Sifton ended up winning the seat by a comfortable margin. One oft- repeated anecdote from the campaign involved a campaign forum for which Brett was late. After giving his own speech, Sifton offered to give the still-absent Brett's speech as well, since he had heard it so many times. He did so, and when Brett eventually arrived to give a speech nearly identical to the one Sifton had given on his behalf he was puzzled by the audience's amusement. Brett unexpectedly dropped out of the 1902 election, a move that hurt the North-West Territories Liberal Party. When Alberta became a province in 1905 Brett ran in Banff for the Conservative Party but was defeated by Liberal candidate and future Speaker of the Legislative Assembly Charles W. Fisher. In 1909 he became president of the Alberta Conservative Party, and later contested the 1909 election for the Cochrane electoral district which replaced the Banff electoral district, losing again to Charles W. Fisher. During his time in the early 20th century he served on a number of boards in Alberta, including the Senate of the University of Alberta. Lieutenant governor of Alberta Robert Brett was appointed the second lieutenant governor of Alberta by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, Governor General, on October 20, 1915, on the advice of Prime Minister Robert Borden. Brett was re- appointed for a second term on December 16, 1920. In 1918, Premier Charles Stewart requested Brett retire Attorney General Charles Wilson Cross, who had refused to tender his resignation in hopes a compromise with the premier could be reached. After 12 days had passed without a response from Cross, Brett signed an order in council removing Charles Cross from his position, the first time in Alberta a lieutenant governor removed a cabinet member. Robert Brett's term as lieutenant governor ended upon his successor William Egbert's appointment on October 29, 1925. Later life Robert Brett died in Calgary on September 16, 1929; he was buried in the Banff Cemetery. Honours Brett received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Alberta in 1915. The City of Edmonton named Robert Brett Park in his honour. The Banff Curling Club, which Brett helped found in 1900, named the Brett Trophy in his honour. Mount Brett, a 2,984-metre mountain located southwest of Banff was named in his honour in 1916. References *Johnson, Margery.

The series deals with the daily life of a precocious, imaginative puppet character named Allegra, and featured live actors, puppets and animation √† la Sesame Street. The show was created by Jan Fleming, John Hoffman and Jim Jinkins, the latter of whom is also the creator of Doug. Two of the puppeteers, Kathryn Mullen and Anthony Asbury, would later work together on the PBS series Between the Lions as the performers of Lionel and Leona Lion. The series also spawned a series of music videos aired during interstitials that aired on Nick Jr. In the 2010s, the first season was released on iTunes and Amazon Video. However, the whole series was released for viewing on Noggin's paid-subscription service from its initial launch. But the second and third seasons of the show will also be released on iTunes and Amazon Video in January 2021. Synopsis The series follows Allegra through the daily triumphs, trials and tribulations of being a little girl. She and her big brother Rondo, along with her best friend Lindi (a yellow dog), a pesky blue neighborhood cat named Riff and a green boy named Poco all try to learn about the world around them with the help of their neighborhood friends. At the end of each episode, Allegra sits at her window and reflects on all the lessons she has learned. The series was music-based and included musically inspired characters named Lindi, Rondo, Riff, Poco, Reed, Miss Melody, Ellington, Encora, Sonata, Clef, Woofer, Aria, Tweeter, Flugie, Vi and of course, Allegra the title character's name herself. There were also segments that feature talking musical instruments that live on the wall of Reed's Music shop. Special character Daphne Dolphin also appears with her friend Salvatore Intieri later in the series. Over 100 original songs were created for the series, under the oversight of musical director Don Sebesky. The original decision to use the name Allegra for the show's protagonist occurred after creator/executive producer Jan Fleming attended a dinner party at the house of London-based academics and was introduced to their youngest daughter, Allegra. That evening, she remarked that it would be a great name for the little girl at the center of the project she was working on. Characters * Allegra (voiced by Kathryn Mullen) ‚Äì The title character of the series, a 4-year-old girl. She is just learning about the world outside of her home and is quite brave. She mostly encounters problems and is always relied on her friends to find a solution. She also is known for having curly doodle hair, which Rondo points out and hates the fact that he does. She is also the leader of the gang. * Rondo (voiced by Anthony Asbury) ‚Äì The older brother of Allegra. Although he often tries to act tough, he has a great deal of love and protection for his younger sister. It is mentioned that he is in the first grade by Allegra. In multiple episodes, Rondo usually walks upside down with his shoes on up. * Lindi (voiced by Pam Arciero) ‚Äì A yellow dog who is Allegra's best friend and lives with Reed. She is feisty and often acts as her voice of reason. She has a love for dance, especially ballet. * Riff (voiced by Martin P. Robinson) ‚Äì The pesky and grumpy neighborhood blue cat and Rondo's best friend and also a big brother type to him. Although he frequently takes advantage of Allegra's naivety, his favorite target is Mr. Cook. * Mr. Cook (voiced by Tim Lagasse) ‚Äì The town baker who is frequently the butt of Riff's antics. He is generally upbeat and always speaks in third person and also speaks broken english. * Poco (voiced by Anthony Asbury) ‚Äì Mr. Cook's nephew.

They may arise separately from the front of the aorta, immediately above the celiac artery, or by a common trunk, which may spring either from the aorta or from the celiac artery. Sometimes one is derived from the aorta, and the other from one of the renal arteries; they rarely arise as separate vessels from the aorta. They diverge from one another across the crura of the diaphragm, and then run obliquely upward and lateralward upon its under surface. * The left phrenic passes behind the esophagus, and runs forward on the left side of the esophageal hiatus. * The right phrenic passes behind the inferior vena cava, and along the right side of the foramen which transmits that vein. Near the back part of the central tendon each vessel divides into a medial and a lateral branch. * The medial branch curves forward, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the musculophrenic and pericardiacophrenic arteries. * The lateral branch passes toward the side of the thorax, and anastomoses with the lower intercostal arteries, and with the musculophrenic. The lateral branch of the right phrenic gives off a few vessels to the inferior vena cava; and the left one, some branches to the esophagus. Each vessel gives off superior suprarenal branches to the suprarenal gland of its own side. The spleen and the liver also receive a few twigs from the left and right vessels respectively.

It lived during the Campanian stage, about 75-72 million years ago. The name Platyceratops is derived from Greek, and means \\"flat horned face\\". Platyceratops is similar to Bagaceratops, although its skull is larger. It has been referred to the Bagaceratopidae or at least the Neoceratopsia. It is possibly a junior synonym of Bagaceratops. The type species is Platyceratops tatarinovi, described by Alifanov in 2003. Classification Platyceratops belonged to the Ceratopsia (the name is Greek for \\"horned face\\"), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks that thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period. The validity of Platyceratops remains in doubt. Both Platyceratops and Bagaceratops were found at the same locality, the Red Beds at Khermeen Tsav, which raises the possibility that they are in fact the same species. Diet Platyceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. See also * Timeline of ceratopsian research References * V. R. Alifanov. 2003.

(93 F.T.C. 618; full name In the Matter of Amway Corporation, Inc., et al.) is a 1979 ruling by the United States Federal Trade Commission concerning the business practices of Amway, a multi-level marketing (MLM) company. The FTC ruled that Amway was not an illegal pyramid scheme according strictly to the statutory definition of a pyramid scheme, but ordered Amway to cease price fixing and cease misrepresenting to its distributors (participants) the average participant's likelihood of financial security and material success. Complaint The FTC filed a complaint on March 25, 1975, alleging five counts of violating Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act:In the Matter of Amway Corporation, Inc., et al. (93 F.T.C. 618), from FTC website. Accessed 2016-03-08. *Count I of the complaint alleged that Amway engaged in resale price maintenance. *Count II alleged that Amway allocated customers among distributors and restricted the distributors' source of supply as well as the retail outlets through which they may resell; *Count III alleged that Amway restricted the distributors' advertising. *Count IV alleged that Amway misrepresented that substantial income may be obtained from geometrical increases in the number of distributors in the chain recruiting operation of the Amway distribution plan. *Count V alleged that Amway misrepresented the profitability of a distributorship and the potential for recruiting new distributors and failed to disclose the substantial business expense involved and the high turnover of distributors. Oral arguments were heard on June 6, 1978.93 F.T.C. 618: page 631 Results The FTC stated Amway was not an illegal pyramid scheme since the Amway system is based on retail sales to consumers. Amway has avoided the abuses of pyramid schemes by: *not requiring an entry (\\"headhunting\\") fee;93 F.T.C. 618: Opinion, page 716 *making product sales a precondition to receiving the performance bonus;93 F.T.C. 618: Initial Decision, page 646 *requiring the buying back of excessive inventory; and *requiring that products be sold to retail consumers. The administrative law judge also found that \\"Amway is not in business to sell distributorships and is not a pyramid distribution scheme.\\"93 F.T.C. 618: Initial Decision, page 700 In the opinion section of the ruling, Commissioner Robert Pitofsky stated: The administrative law judge found, and the FTC opinion agreed, that Amway engaged in: * resale price maintenance, through explicit agreements on wholesale prices and through practices \\"designed to insure adherence\\" to its suggested retail prices even though former explicit agreements on retail prices had been discontinued;93 F.T.C. 618: Opinion, pages 717-718 and * misleading sales and earning claims.93 F.T.C. 618: Opinion, page 735 In the Final Order, issued on May 8, 1979, Amway and its representatives were ordered to: * cease allocating customers among their distributors; * cease retail price fixing;93 F.T.C. 618: Final Order, pages 736-737 * print a specific disclaimer on any suggested retail price list; and * cease misrepresenting profits, earnings, or sales; and stop implying other than average results, unless the average results or the percentage of distributors actually reaching those figures is also conspicuously disclosed.93 F.T.C. 618: Final Order, pages 736-738 Later actions In 1986, Amway agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty in a consent decree for violating the 1979 ruling, after Amway placed ads that represented higher- than-average distributor earnings without stating the actual average results or percentage of distributors who actually met the represented claims.
