The work is based on poetry by John Donne and Emily Dickinson and is regarded as one of the key compositions of Adams' \\"minimalist\\" period. The work was premiered by the San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Symphony Chorus, with conductor Edo de Waart, on 15 April 1981, and subsequently recorded it. The UK premiere was on 13 October 1987 at Birmingham Town Hall, with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO) conducted by Simon Rattle. Rattle and the CBSO gave the London premiere on 28 July 1990 at The Proms.  Music  Each movement is a setting of an entire poem: \\"Because I could not stop for Death\\" ends with an orchestral interlude that segues into \\"Wild Nights\\" without a pause. A typical performance takes about 35 minutes. Timothy Johnson has discussed various aspects of the harmonic language of Harmonium in detail. K. Robert Schwarz has noted the influence of the musical techniques of Steve Reich on Harmonium, and also has commented on the less schematic and more \\"intuitive\\" manner of Adams' composition in the work. Harmonium and The Chairman Dances (another work by Adams) were featured in the Civilization IV soundtrack.

History Early history The Frythe was part of the property of Holywell Priory, Shoreditch, and in 1523 William Wilshere obtained a sixty- year lease of the Frythe from the priory. As a result of the dissolution of the monasteries, in 1539 the property was granted to Sir John Gostwick and Joan his wife. Within ten years, Wilshere had purchased The Frythe from Gostwick's heirs, and the property remained in the possession of the Wilshere family for several centuries. The present \\"Gothic revival\\" mansion was built in 1846 for William Wilshere (MP for Great Yarmouth from 1837 to 1846). The architects were Thomas Smith and Edward Blore. After William Wilshere's death in 1867 the house was enlarged by his brother Charles Willes Wilshere who inherited it. In 1908 on Charles Wilshere's death, it passed on to his three unmarried daughters until the last one died in 1934. The estate passed to a great-nephew, Captain Gerald Maunsell Gamul Farmer, of a landed gentry family of Nonsuch, Surrey, who adopted the surname of Wilshere,Burke's Landed Gentry 17th edition, ed. L. G. Pine, 1952, pp. 811, 2745 and ran the house as \\"The Frythe Residential and Private Hotel\\". SOE Station IX Weapon developed by Station IX 'The Frythe' was commandeered in August 1939 by the British Military Intelligence. During the Second World War it became a secret British Special Operations Executive factory known as Station IX making commando equipment. Secret research included military vehicles and equipment, explosives and technical sabotage, camouflage, biological and chemical warfare. In the grounds of The Frythe small cabins and barracks functioned as laboratories and workshops. Research facility The Frythe was for many years a commercial research facility, operated by ICI from 1946, by Unilever from 1963 and by Smith, Kline & French from 1977. Unilever From 1946 to 1963 the site was shared by ICI with Unilever. New buildings were built by Unilever in the 1960s, with a contract for ¬£400,000 in 1964 to Taylor Woodrow. Research was conducted on edible oils, margarine, ice cream, and frozen foods in the 1960s. Techniques included molecular biophysics, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), mass spectrometry, ESR spectroscopy (electron paramagnetic resonance), and infrared spectroscopy. GSK Cimetidine, discovered at The Frythe Smith, Kline & French discovered Tagamet (Cimetidine) at The Frythe in 1971, which treats peptic ulcers by Sir James Black FRS and C. Robin Ganellin FRS with research on H2 antagonist. Residential Accommodation The Frythe site was closed by GlaxoSmithKline and sold to a property development company on 19 December 2010. In 2017 the conversion of the property into flats was still underway.

Causes Hyperpigmentation can be caused by sun damage, inflammation, or other skin injuries, including those related to acne vulgaris.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . People with darker skin tones are more prone to hyperpigmentation, especially with excess sun exposure. Many forms of hyperpigmentation are caused by an excess production of melanin. Hyperpigmentation can be diffuse or focal, affecting such areas as the face and the back of the hands. Melanin is produced by melanocytes at the lower layer of the epidermis. Melanin is a class of pigment responsible for producing colour in the body in places such as the eyes, skin, and hair. As the body ages, melanocyte distribution becomes less diffuse and its regulation less controlled by the body. UV light stimulates melanocyte activity, and where concentration of the cells is greater, hyperpigmentation occurs. Another form of hyperpigmentation is post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. These are dark and discoloured spots that appear on the skin following acne that has healed.Hyperpigmentation on Face (Acne Scars) Hyperpigmentation, Dark Spots, Acne Scars, Meladerm\\". Hyperpigmentation is associated with a number of diseases or conditions, including the following: *Addison's disease and other sources of adrenal insufficiency, in which hormones that stimulate melanin synthesis, such as melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), are frequently elevated. *Cushing's disease or other excessive adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production, because MSH production is a byproduct of ACTH synthesis from proopiomelanocortin (POMC). *Acanthosis nigricans‚Äîhyperpigmentation of intertriginous areas associated with insulin resistance. *Melasma, also known as 'chloasma' or the ‚Äúmask of pregnancy,‚Äù when it occurs in pregnant women.‚Äî It is a common skin problem that causes dark discolored patchy hyperpigmentation. It typically occurs on the face and is symmetrical, with matching marks on both sides of the face. The condition is much more common in women than men, though men can get it too. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 90 percent of people who develop melasma are women. *Acne scarring from post-inflammatary hyperpigmentation *Linea nigra‚Äîa hyperpigmented line found on the abdomen during pregnancy. *Peutz‚ÄìJeghers syndrome‚Äîan autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hyperpigmented macules on the lips and oral mucosa and gastrointestinal polyps. *Exposure to certain chemicals such as salicylic acid, bleomycin, and cisplatin. *Smoker's melanosis *Coeliac disease *Cronkhite‚ÄìCanada syndrome *Porphyria *Tinea fungal infections such as ringworm *Haemochromatosis‚Äîa common but debilitating genetic disorder characterized by the chronic accumulation of iron in the body. *Mercury poisoning‚Äîparticularly cases of cutaneous exposure resulting from the topical application of mercurial ointments or skin-whitening creams. *Aromatase deficiency *Nelson's syndrome *Graves' disease *Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SOID) *As a result of tinea cruris. Hyperpigmentation can sometimes be induced by dermatological laser procedures. Diagnosis * A physical examination including, Wood's lamp examination and a detailed history, usually sufficient for diagnosis. * Skin examination. * Viewing medical history. Treatment There are a wide range of depigmenting treatments used for hyperpigmentation conditions, and responses to most are variable. Most often treatment of hyperpigmentation caused by melanin overproduction (such as melasma, acne scarring, liver spots) includes the use of topical depigmenting agents, which vary in their efficacy and safety, as well as in prescription rules. Several are prescription only in the US, especially in high doses, such as hydroquinone, azelaic acid, and koijic acid. Some are available without prescription, such as niacinamide, or cysteamine hydrochloride. Hydroquinone was the most commonly prescribed hyperpigmentation treatment before the long-term safety concerns were raised, and the use of it became more regulated in several countries and discouraged in general by WHO. For the US only 2% is at present sold over-the-counter, and 4% needs prescription. In the EU hydroquinone was banned from cosmetic applications. Oral medication with procyanidin plus vitamins A, C, and E also shows promise as safe and effective for epidermal melasma. In an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 56 Filipino women, treatment was associated with significant improvements in the left and right malar regions, and was safe and well tolerated.. Other treatments that do not involve topical agents are also available, including fraction lasers and dermabrasion.

She was perhaps best known as the estranged wife of silent film star Rudolph Valentino. Early life and career Jean Acker was born Harriet Ackers on October 23, 1893 in Trenton, New Jersey. Her father was Joseph Ackers, said to be of Cherokee descent. Her mother Margaret (unconfirmed) was Irish. In the 1900 census, Harriet is with Joseph and her grandparents, but no wife of Joseph is listed. In fact, he is reported to be single. Growing up on a farm, she became an expert horsewoman. She attended the St. Mary's Seminary in Springfield, New Jersey, for a time. Sometime prior to 1907, the family moved to Lewistown, Pennsylvania. In the 1907 Lewistown Directory, Joseph is listed with a wife by the name of Eleanor. When he married Eleanor is not yet known, but it was after 1900 and before the family moved to Lewistown. They were divorced in 1912. Six years later, Joseph married Virginia Erb in Lewistown. He managed the Casino Bowling Alley and The Ritz restaurant, and later owned the Boston Shoe Store on Valley Street. He also managed several bowling alleys in the Philadelphia area, and it may have been that during these visits Jean was \\"bitten by the acting bug.\\" She performed in vaudeville until she moved to California in 1919.Leider, Emily W. Dark Lover: The Life and Death of Rudolph Valentino. New York City, Farrar Straus Giroux, 2003. . p. 100. After arriving in Hollywood, Acker became the protegee and lover of Alla Nazimova, an actress whose clout and contacts enabled Acker to negotiate a $200 per week contract with a movie studio. Acker appeared in numerous films during the 1910s and 1920s, but by the early 1930s, she began appearing in small, mostly uncredited film roles. She made her last on-screen appearance in the 1955 film How to Be Very, Very Popular, opposite Betty Grable. Marriage to Valentino Acker in 1923 After meeting and befriending the then-struggling actor Rudolph Valentino at a party, they entered a two-month courtship and married on November 6, 1919. Acker quickly had regrets and locked him out of their hotel bedroom on their wedding night. The marriage was reportedly never consummated. After filing for divorce, Valentino did not wait the requisite period for it to be finalized before marrying his second wife, Natacha Rambova, in Mexico, and he was charged with bigamy when the couple returned to the United States. Acker then sued Valentino for the legal right to call herself Mrs. Rudolph Valentino. Valentino remained angry with her for several years, but they mended their friendship before his death in 1926. Acker wrote a popular song about him soon after he died called \\"We Will Meet at the End of the Trail\\". Acker had an affair with the actress Alla Nazimova. Nazimova included Acker in what was dubbed the sewing circles, a group of actresses who were forced to conceal the fact that they were lesbian or bisexual, thus living secret lives. Another of her female lovers was Grace Darmond, with whom she was involved during her relationship with Valentino. In the 1977 film Valentino a character loosely based on Acker is played by Carol Kane. In the credits, the character is simply called Starlet. Later life and death After divorcing Valentino in 1923, Acker was engaged to Marquis Luis de Bezan y Sandoval of Spain. Then, she was in the news over her relationship with Rahmin Bey. In 1930, after she lost her fortune in the 1929 stock market crash, she sued William Delahanty, claiming that he agreed to pay her $18,400 per year if she gave up her film career. The married politician denied that he made such a promise but admitted that he spent thousands of dollars on Acker. Acker met Chloe Carter (June 21, 1903 - October 28, 1993), a former Ziegfeld Follies girl, who was the first wife of film composer Harry Ruby. Acker remained with Carter for the rest of her life. The couple owned an apartment building together in Beverly Hills. Acker died of natural causes in 1978 at the age of 84, and is buried next to Carter in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.Wilson, Scott.

Her face dominates an outdoor mural titled \\"Mifflin County Movie History\\" and is located on Monument Square in Downtown Lewistown.

The lake's outflow is the Arnold River, a tributary of the Grey River. The lake lies 31 kilometres to the southeast of Greymouth. The main settlement close to the lake is Moana, on the northern shore. Located several kilometres inland from the coast road (), it is less frequently visited by tourists than many of the West Coast's scenic highlights, but it is becoming increasingly popular, in part due to its reputation for fishing. Lake Brunner was named by John Rochfort for the 19th century explorer Thomas Brunner. The MƒÅori name for the lake, Kotuku moana, means \\"Sea of herons\\". The New Zealand freshwater mussel (Hyridella menziesi) is found in the lake. By 1976 twenty percent of the catchment of the lake was farmed and there was a population of 84 at the settlement of Moana. Water quality The waters of Lake Brunner have been monitored since the 1990s and it shows that the water quality of the lake is declining. By 2010 all the measured determinates for water quality were trending up but it was still considered to have good water quality. The poorest water quality is at Cashmere Bay, next to Moana. The West Coast Regional Council 2007 Proposed Water Management Plan is to have the water quality maintained or improved.

It involves the adhesion of the visceral and the costal pleura. The mediastinal pleura is spared.  Uses  Pleurodesis is performed to prevent recurrence of pneumothorax or recurrent pleural effusion. It can be done chemically or surgically. It is generally avoided in patients with cystic fibrosis, if possible, because lung transplantation becomes more difficult following this procedure. Previous pneumothorax with or without pleurodesis is not a contraindication to subsequent lung transplantation.  Chemical  Chemicals such as bleomycin, tetracycline (e.g., minocycline), povidone-iodine, or a slurry of talc can be introduced into the pleural space through a chest drain. The instilled chemicals cause irritation between the parietal and the visceral layers of the pleura which closes off the space between them and prevents further fluid from accumulating. Pharmacy-prepared chemicals for pleurodesis should be clearly labeled \\"NOT FOR IV ADMINISTRATION\\" to avoid potentially fatal wrong-site medication errors. Povidone iodine is equally effective and safe as talc, and may be preferred because of easy availability and low cost. Chemical pleurodesis is a painful procedure, and so patients are often premedicated with a sedative and analgesics. A local anesthetic may be instilled into the pleural space, or an epidural catheter may be placed for anesthesia.  Surgical  Surgical pleurodesis may be performed via thoracotomy or thoracoscopy. This involves mechanically irritating the parietal pleura, often with a rough pad. Moreover, surgical removal of parietal pleura is an effective way of achieving stable pleurodesis. Alternatively, tunneled pleural catheters (TPCs) may be placed in an outpatient setting and often result in auto-pleurodesis, whereby portable vacuum bottles are used to evacuate the pleural fluid. Routine evacuation keeps the pleura together, resulting in physical agitation by the catheter, which slowly causes the pleura to scar together. This method, though the minimally invasive and minimal cost solution, takes an average of about 30 days to achieve pleurodesis and is therefore the slowest means of achieving pleurodesis among other modalities. Sterile talc powder, administered intrapleurally via a chest tube, is indicated as a sclerosing agent to decrease the recurrence of malignant pleural effusions in symptomatic patients.

Typical examples include premedicating with a sedative or analgesic before surgery; using prophylactic (preventive) antibiotics before surgery; and using antiemetics or antihistamines before chemotherapy. Premedication before chemotherapy for cancer often consists of drug regimens (usually 2 or more drugs, e.g. dexamethasone, diphenhydramine and omeprazole) given to a patient minutes to hours before the chemotherapy to avert side effects or hypersensitivity reactions (i.e. allergic reactions). Melatonin has been found to be effective as a premedication in both adults and children due to its pharmacological properties of hypnotic, antinociceptive and anticonvulsant which produce effective anxiolosis and sedation. Unlike midazolam melatonin does not impair psychomotor skills or adversely affect the quality of recovery. It has a faster recovery time compared to midazolam and has a reduced incidence of post-operative excitement and results in a reduction in dose required of propofol and thiopental. Midazolam is effective in children in reducing anxiety associated with separation from parents and induction of anesthesia. Sufentanil is also sometimes used as a premedication. Clonidine is becoming increasingly popular as a premedication for children. One drawback of clonidine is that it can take up to 45 minutes to take full effect. In children, clonidine has been found to be equal to and possibly superior to benzodiazepines as a premedication. It has a more favourable side effect profile. It also reduces the need for an induction agent. It improves post- operative pain relief, is better at inducing sedation at induction, reduces agitated emergence, reduces shivering and post-operative nausea and vomiting and reduces post-operative delirium associated with sevoflurane anaesthesia. Benzodiazepines such as midazolam are more commonly used due largely to a lack of a marketing effort by the pharmaceutical companies. As a result, clonidine is becoming increasingly popular with anesthesiologists. Dexmedetomidine and atypical antipsychotic agents are other premedications which are used particularly in very uncooperative children. Non-drug interventions for children include playing relaxing music, massages, reducing noise and controlling light to maintain the sleep wake cycle. Other non-pharmacological options for children who refuse or cannot tolerate premedication include clown doctors; low sensory stimulation and hand-held video games may also help reduce anxiety during induction of general anesthesia.

It is used to remove air (pneumothorax), fluid (pleural effusion, blood, chyle), or pus (empyema) from the intrathoracic space. It is also known as a B√ºlau drain or an intercostal catheter. The concept of chest drainage was first advocated by Hippocrates when he described the treatment of empyema by means of incision, cautery, and insertion of metal tubes. However, the technique was not widely used until the influenza epidemic of 1918 to drain post-pneumonic empyema, which was first documented by Dr. C. Pope, on \\"Joel\\", a 22-month-old infant. The use of chest tubes in postoperative thoracic care was reported in 1922, and they were regularly used post-thoracotomy in World War II, though they were not routinely used for emergency tube thoracostomy following acute trauma until the Korean War. Medical uses Left-sided pneumothorax (right side of image) on CT scan of the chest with chest tube in place. *Pneumothorax: accumulation of air or gas in the pleural space *Pleural effusion: accumulation of fluid in the pleural space **Chylothorax: a collection of lymphatic fluid in the pleural space **Empyema: a pyogenic infection of the pleural space **Hemothorax: accumulation of blood in the pleural space **Hydrothorax: accumulation of serous fluid in the pleural space Contraindications Contraindications to chest tube placement include refractory coagulopathy and presence of a diaphragmatic hernia, as well as hepatic hydrothorax. Additional contraindications include scarring in the pleural space (adhesions). Complications The most common complication of a chest tube is chest tube clogging. Chest tube clogging is widely recognized in published surveys of surgeons and nurses. In one study, 100% had seen chest tube clogging, and a majority had seen adverse patient outcomes from chest tube clogging. In a prospective observational study, over 36% of patients had chest tube clogging after heart surgery. Chest tube clogging can lead to retained blood around the heart and lungs that can contribute to complications and increase mortality. If a chest tube clogs when the patient is still bleeding they can become hypotensive from tamponade, or develop a large hemothorax. If there is not enough to cause a mechanical compression of the heart or lungs, the resulting inflammatory response to the retained blood can lead to pleural and pericardial effusions and contribute to the triggering of postoperative atrial fibrillation in susceptible individuals. A common complication after thoracic surgery that arises within 30‚Äì50% of patients are air leaks. If a chest tube clogs when there is an airleak the patient will develop a pneumothorax. This can be life threatening. Here, digital chest drainage systems can provide real time information as they monitor intra-pleural pressure and air leak flow, constantly. Keeping vigilant about chest tube clogging is imperative for the team taking care of the patient in the early postoperative period. Major insertion complications include hemorrhage, infection, and reexpansion pulmonary edema. Injury to the liver, spleen or diaphragm is possible if the tube is placed inferior to the pleural cavity. Injuries to the thoracic aorta and heart can also occur. When chest tubes are placed due to either blunt or penetrating trauma, antibiotics decrease the risks of infectious complications. Minor complications include a subcutaneous hematoma or seroma, anxiety, shortness of breath, and cough (after removing large volume of fluid). In most cases, the chest tube related pain goes away after the chest tube is removed, however, chronic pain related to chest tube induced scarring of the intercostal space is not uncommon. Subcutaneous emphysema indicates backpressure created by undrained air, often caused by a clogged chest tube or insufficient negative pressure. If a patient has subcutaneous emphysema, it is likely their chest tube is not draining and consideration should be given if it should be unclogged or another tube should be placed so that the air leaking from the lung can be adequately drained. Device Characteristics thumb|right|Size of chest tube: Adult male = 28‚Äì32 Fr Pp Adult female = 28 Fr Child = 18 Fr Newborn = 12‚Äì14 Fr Chest tube drainage holes Chest tubes are commonly made from clear plastics like PVC and soft silicone. Chest tubes are made in a range of sizes measured by their external diameter from 6 Fr to 40 Fr. Chest tubes, like most catheters, are measured in French catheter scale. For adults, 20 Fr to 40 Fr (6.7 to 13.3mm external diameter) are commonly used, and 6 Fr to 26 Fr for children. Conventional chest tubes feature multiple drainage fenestrations in the section of the tube which resides inside the patient, as well as distance markers along the length of the tube, and a radiopaque stripe which outlines the first drainage hole. Chest tubes are also provided in right angle, trocar, flared, and tapered configurations for different drainage needs. As well, some chest tubes are coated with heparin to help prevent thrombus formation, though the effect of this is disputed. Chest tube have an end hole (proximal, toward the patient) and a series of side holes. The number of side holes is generally 6 on most chest tubes. The length of tube that has side holes is the effective drainage length (EDL). In chest tubes designed for pediatric heart surgery, the EDL is shorter, generally by only having 4 side holes. Channel style chest drains, also called Blake drains, are so-called silastic drains made of silicone and feature open flutes that reside inside the patient. Drainage is thought to be achieved by capillary action, allowing the fluids to travel through the open grooves into a closed cross section, which contains the fluid and allows it to be suctioned through the tube. Though these chest tubes are more expensive than conventional ones, they are theoretically less painful. Chest drainage system Portable electronic system Chest tube drainage system diagram, with parts labeled in A chest drainage system is typically used to collect chest drainage (air, blood, effusions). Most commonly, drainage systems use three chambers which are based on the three-bottle system. The first chamber allows fluid that is drained from the chest to be collected. The second chamber functions as a \\"water seal\\", which acts as a one way valve allowing gas to escape, but not reenter the chest. Air bubbling through the water seal chamber is usual when the patient coughs or exhales but may indicate, if continual, a pleural or system leak that should be evaluated critically. It can also indicate a leak of air from the lung. The third chamber is the suction control chamber. The height of the water in this chamber regulates the negative pressure applied to the system. A gentle bubbling through the water column minimizes evaporation of the fluid and indicates that the suction is being regulated to the height of the water column. In this way, increased wall suction does not increase the negative pressure of the system. Newer drainage systems eliminate the water seal using a mechanical check-valve, and some also use a mechanical regulator to regulate the suction pressure. Systems which employ both these are dubbed \\"dry\\" systems, whereas systems that retain the water seal but use a mechanical regulator are called \\"wet-dry\\" systems. Systems which use a water seal and water column regulator are called \\"wet\\" systems. Dry systems are advantageous as tip-overs of wet systems can spill and mix with blood, mandating the replacement of the system. Even newer systems are smaller and more ambulatory so the patient can be sent home for drainage if indicated. More recently digital or electronic chest drainage systems have been introduced. An onboard motor is used as vacuum source along with an integrated suction control canister and water seal. These systems monitor the patient and will alert if the measured data are out of range. Due to the digital control of the negative pressure, the system is able to objectively quantify the presence of a pleural or system leak. Digital drainage systems allow clinicians to mobilize patients early, even for those on continuous suction, which is difficult to accomplish with the traditional water-seal system under suction. Recently published clinical data indicates, that application of such systems can also lead to a reduction in complications. Technique Tube thoracostomy The insertion technique for emergency pleural drainage is described in detail in an article of the NEJM. The free end of the tube is usually attached to an underwater seal, below the level of the chest. This allows the air or fluid to escape from the pleural space, and prevents anything returning to the chest. Alternatively, the tube can be attached to a flutter valve. This allows patients with pneumothorax to remain more mobile. British Thoracic Society recommends the tube is inserted in an area described as the \\"safe zone\\", a region bordered by: the lateral border of pectoralis major, a horizontal line inferior to the axilla, the anterior border of latissimus dorsi and a horizontal line superior to the nipple. More specifically, the tube is inserted into the 5th intercostal space slightly anterior to the mid axillary line. Chest tubes are usually inserted under local anesthesia. The skin over the area of insertion is first cleansed with antiseptic solution, such as iodine, before sterile drapes are placed around the area. The local anesthetic is injected into the skin and down to the muscle, and after the area is numb a small incision is made in the skin and a passage made through the skin and muscle into the chest. The tube is placed through this passage. If necessary, patients may be given additional analgesics for the procedure. Once the tube is in place it is sutured to the skin to prevent it falling out and a dressing applied to the area. Once the drain is in place, a chest radiograph will be taken to check the location of the drain. The tube stays in for as long as there is air or fluid to be removed, or risk of air gathering. Chest tubes can also be placed using a trocar, which is a pointed metallic bar used to guide the tube through the chest wall. This method is less popular due to an increased risk of iatrogenic lung injury. Placement using the Seldinger technique, in which a blunt guidewire is passed through a needle (over which the chest tube is then inserted) has been described. Protocols to maintain chest tube patency by preventing chest tube clogging are necessary. Postoperative drainage The placement technique for postoperative drainage (e.g. cardiac surgery) differs from the technique used for emergency situations. At the completion of open cardiac procedures, chest tubes are placed through separate stab incisions, typically near the inferior aspect of the sternotomy incision. In some instances multiple drains may be used to evacuate the mediastinal, pericardial, and pleural spaces. The drainage holes are placed inside the patient and the chest tube is passed out through the incision. Once the tube is in place, it is sutured to the skin to prevent movement. The chest tube is then connected to the drainage canister using additional tubing and connectors and connected to a suction source, typically regulated to -20 cm of water. Dressings After suturing, dressings are applied for hygienical reasons covering the wound. First, a y-slit compress is used around the tube. Second, a compress (10 x 10 cm) is placed on top and finally an adhesive plaster is added in a way that tension is avoided. A bridle rein is recommended to fix the tube to the skin. This tape bridge will prevent the tube from moving backwards and the possibility to cause clogging. It also prevents pain as it reduces tension on the fixation stitch. Alternatively, a large adhesive plaster that functions like a tape bridge may be used. Chest tube management Chest tubes should be kept free of dependent loops, kinks, and obstructions which may prevent drainage. In general, chest tubes are not clamped except during insertion, removal, or when diagnosing air leaks. Manual manipulation, often called milking, stripping, fan folding, or tapping, of chest tubes is commonly performed to clear chest tube obstructions. No conclusive evidence has demonstrated that any of these techniques are more effective than the others, and no method has shown to improve chest tube drainage. Furthermore, chest tube manipulation has proved to increase negative pressure, which may be detrimental, and painful to the patient. For these reasons, many hospitals do not allow these types of manual tube manipulations. One option is active chest tube clearance without breaking the sterile field. According to a consensus of multiple experts in cardiac surgery, anesthesia and critical care in 2019 the ERAS Guidelines for Perioperative Care recommends active clearance of chest tubes to prevent retained blood and other complications. This was given an IB-NR rating, meaning, it should routinely be performed. Makeshift efforts such as open chest tube clearing that involves breaking the sterile environment separating the chest tube from the drainage canister tubing to suction it out should not be performed (Class III, A). Chest tube side of placement In December 2018 the European Respiratory Journal published correspondences that raise the possibility of improving mobility as well as patient outcomes by placing a chest tube more optimally.

A Galois group G associated to a field extension L/K acts in a natural way on some abelian groups, for example those constructed directly from L, but also through other Galois representations that may be derived by more abstract means. Galois cohomology accounts for the way in which taking Galois-invariant elements fails to be an exact functor.  History  The current theory of Galois cohomology came together around 1950, when it was realised that the Galois cohomology of ideal class groups in algebraic number theory was one way to formulate class field theory, at the time it was in the process of ridding itself of connections to L-functions. Galois cohomology makes no assumption that Galois groups are abelian groups, so that this was a non-abelian theory. It was formulated abstractly as a theory of class formations. Two developments of the 1960s turned the position around. Firstly, Galois cohomology appeared as the foundational layer of √©tale cohomology theory (roughly speaking, the theory as it applies to zero-dimensional schemes). Secondly, non-abelian class field theory was launched as part of the Langlands philosophy. The earliest results identifiable as Galois cohomology had been known long before, in algebraic number theory and the arithmetic of elliptic curves. The normal basis theorem implies that the first cohomology group of the additive group of L will vanish; this is a result on general field extensions, but was known in some form to Richard Dedekind. The corresponding result for the multiplicative group is known as Hilbert's Theorem 90, and was known before 1900. Kummer theory was another such early part of the theory, giving a description of the connecting homomorphism coming from the m-th power map. In fact for a while the multiplicative case of a 1-cocycle for groups that are not necessarily cyclic was formulated as the solubility of Noether's equations, named for Emmy Noether; they appear under this name in Emil Artin's treatment of Galois theory, and may have been folklore in the 1920s. The case of 2-cocycles for the multiplicative group is that of the Brauer group, and the implications seem to have been well known to algebraists of the 1930s. In another direction, that of torsors, these were already implicit in the infinite descent arguments of Fermat for elliptic curves. Numerous direct calculations were done, and the proof of the Mordell‚ÄìWeil theorem had to proceed by some surrogate of a finiteness proof for a particular H1 group. The 'twisted' nature of objects over fields that are not algebraically closed, which are not isomorphic but become so over the algebraic closure, was also known in many cases linked to other algebraic groups (such as quadratic forms, simple algebras, Severi‚ÄìBrauer varieties), in the 1930s, before the general theory arrived. The needs of number theory were in particular expressed by the requirement to have control of a local-global principle for Galois cohomology. This was formulated by means of results in class field theory, such as Hasse's norm theorem. In the case of elliptic curves it led to the key definition of the Tate‚ÄìShafarevich group in the Selmer group, which is the obstruction to the success of a local-global principle. Despite its great importance, for example in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, it proved very difficult to get any control of it, until results of Karl Rubin gave a way to show in some cases it was finite (a result generally believed, since its conjectural order was predicted by an L-function formula). The other major development of the theory, also involving John Tate was the Tate‚ÄìPoitou duality result. Technically speaking, G may be a profinite group, in which case the definitions need to be adjusted to allow only continuous cochains.

The purpose of a thoracotomy is the first step used to facilitate thoracic surgeries including lobectomy or pneumonectomy for lung cancer or to gain thoracic access in major trauma. Approaches There are many different surgical approaches to performing a thoracotomy. Some common forms of thoracotomies include: * Median sternotomy provides wide access to the mediastinum and is the incision of choice for most open-heart surgery and access to the anterior mediastinum * Posterolateral thoracotomy is an incision through an intercostal space on the back, and is often widened with rib spreaders. It is a very common approach for operations on the lung or posterior mediastinum, including the esophagus. When performed over the fifth intercostal space, it allows optimal access to the pulmonary hilum (pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein) and therefore is considered the approach of choice for pulmonary resection (pneumonectomy and lobectomy). * Anterolateral thoracotomy is performed upon the anterior chest wall; left anterolateral thoracotomy is the incision of choice for open chest massage, a critical maneuver in the management of traumatic cardiac arrest. Anterolateral thoracotomy, like most surgical incisions, requires the use of tissue retractors‚Äîin this case, a \\"rib spreader\\" such as the Tuffier retractor. * Bilateral anterolateral thoracotomy combined with transverse sternotomy results in the \\"clamshell\\" incision * The Ashrafian or Aztec thoracotomy was devised to give rapid access to the heart and pericardium through an incision that consists of an anterior thoracic incision followed in a vertical direction along the costo-chondral (rib-cartilage) junction. Upon completion of the surgical procedure, the chest is closed. One or more chest tubes‚Äîwith one end inside the opened pleural cavity and the other submerged under saline solution inside a sealed container, forming an airtight drainage system‚Äîare necessary to remove air and fluid from the pleural cavity, preventing the development of pneumothorax or hemothorax. Complications In addition to pneumothorax, complications from thoracotomy include air leaks, infection, bleeding and respiratory failure. Postoperative pain is universal and intense, generally requiring the use of opioid analgesics for moderation, as well as interfering with the recovery of respiratory function. Paraplegia complicating thoracotomy is rare but catastrophic. In nearly all cases a chest tube, or more than one chest tube is placed. These tubes are used to drain air and fluid until the patient heals enough to take them out (usually a few days). Complications such as pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, or subcutaneous emphysema can occur if these chest tubes become clogged. Furthermore, complications such as pleural effusion or hemothorax can occur if the chest tubes fail to drain the fluid around the lung in the pleural space after a thoracotomy. Clinicians should be on the look out for chest tube clogging as these tubes have a tendency to become occluded with fibrinous material or clot in the post operative period, and when this happens, complications ensue. In the long term, post-operative chronic pain can develop, known as thoracotomy pain syndrome, and may last from a few years to a lifetime. Treatment to aid pain relief for this condition includes intra-thoracic nerve blocks/opiates and epidurals, although results vary from person to person and are dependent on numerous factors. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there is moderate-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing persistent postoperative pain after three to 18 months after thoracotomy. VATS Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a less invasive alternative to thoracotomy in selected cases, much like laparoscopic surgery. Like laparoscopic surgery, its applications are rapidly expanding. Robotic surgery is a new but rapidly growing alternative that uses advanced technology with proven advantages. Post-thoracotomy pain Thoracic epidural analgesia or paravertebral blockade have shown to be the most effective methods for post-thoracotomy pain control. However, contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia include hypovolemia, shock, increase in ICP, coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia, sepsis, or infection at puncture site. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation has also shown to be useful in the management of post-thoracotomy pain. Specifically, it has been found to be a good adjunct in the management of moderate to severe post-thoracotomy pain and effective as a lone modality in mild post-thoracotomy pain (e.g. after video-assisted thoracoscopy).Ferreira, FC, et al.

He has been a Member of Magnum Photos since 1954.  Early life  Erwitt was born in Paris, France, to Jewish-Russian immigrant parents, who soon moved to Italy. In 1939, when he was ten, his family migrated to the United States. He studied photography and filmmaking at Los Angeles City College and the New School for Social Research, finishing his education in 1950. In 1951 he was drafted into the Army, and discharged in 1953.  Photography career  Vienna 2012 Erwitt served as a photographer's assistant in the 1950s in the United States Army while stationed in France and Germany. He was influenced by meeting the famous photographers Edward Steichen, Robert Capa and Roy Stryker. Stryker, the former Director of the Farm Security Administration's photography department, hired Erwitt to work on a photography project for the Standard Oil Company. He then began a freelance photographer career and produced work for Collier's, Look, Life and Holiday. Erwitt was invited to become a member of Magnum Photos by the founder Robert Capa. One of the subjects Erwitt has frequently photographed in his career is dogs: they have been the subject of five of his books, Son of Bitch (1974), To the Dogs (1992), Dog Dogs (1998), Woof (2005), and Elliott Erwitt's Dogs (2008). Erwitt has created an alter ego, the beret-wearing and pretentious \\"Andr√© S. Solidor\\" (which abbreviates to \\"ass\\") ‚Äî \\"a contemporary artist, from one of the French colonies in the Caribbean, I forget which one\\" ‚Äî to \\"satirise the kooky excesses of contemporary photography.\\" His work was published in a book, The Art of Andr√© S. Solidor (2009), and exhibited in 2011 at the Paul Smith Gallery in London. Erwitt was awarded the Royal Photographic Society's Centenary Medal and an honorary fellowship (HonFRPS) in 2002 in recognition of a sustained, significant contribution to the art of photography.Royal Photographic Society's Centenary Award and the International Center for Photography's Infinity Award, Lifetime Achievement category, in 2011.  Filmmaking career  Since the 1970s, he has devoted much of his energy toward movies. His feature films, television commercials, and documentary films include Arthur Penn: the Director (1970), Beauty Knows No Pain (1971), Red, White and Bluegrass (1973) and the prize-winning Glassmakers of Herat, Afghanistan (1977). He was, as well, credited as camera operator for Gimme Shelter (1970), still photographer for Bob Dylan: No Direction Home (2005), and provided addition photography for Get Yer Ya Ya's Out (2009). A collection of Erwitt's films were screened in 2011 as part of the DocNYC Festival's special event \\"An Evening with Elliott Erwitt\\".

Amongst others, he played with Hellas Verona in Italy, helping the club to the only major title of its history, the 1985 Serie A. Additionally, Elkj√¶r scored nearly 40 goals for the Danish national team in 11 years, being a leading figure for the Danish side under coach Sepp Piontek that played at the Euro 1984 and the 1986 World Cup (a first-ever appearance), often hailed as the golden generation of Danish football by their countrymen. Elkj√¶r won the Bronze Ball award at the latter competition. Widely regarded as one of the best forwards of the 1980s, Elkj√¶r finished second in the Ballon d'Or awards in 1985, having been placed third the previous year, and going on to finish fourth in 1986. In Verona he is still remembered fondly, having earned the persisting nickname \\"Il sindaco\\" (the mayor) during his stint for the club. To this day, at least a few hundred voters in the city continue to write his name on their ballots at the mayoral elections. Renowned for his goal-scoring abilities and persona, he also remains one of the most popular athletes in his native Denmark. Club career Germany/Belgium Born 11 September 1957, in Copenhagen, Elkj√¶r's career started with Vanl√∏se IF in 1976, where he stayed for just one season, playing 15 games and scoring seven goals. He then joined 1. FC K√∂ln in Germany, at the time one of Europe's leading clubs. With the team, he won the 1978 domestic Cup (his entire campaign consisted of nine minutes in the final, against Hertha BSC), but never got on with the manager or the harsh, disciplined atmosphere of a German dressing room,Lundberg (1988), p.91 and eventually left. One falling out with the coach Hennes Weisweiler earned a legendary status in Denmark: Weisweiler approached Elkj√¶r and said that he had been informed that the player had spent the night at a nightclub in the company of a bottle of whiskey and a lady, and wanted to know if that was true. Elkj√¶r replied that it was a lie, in fact it was a bottle of vodka and two ladies.Per H√∏yer Hansen: \\"Det' H√∏yer\\" In February 1978, Elkj√¶r moved to K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen in Belgium where he stayed for five years, the longest spell at any club during his entire career. There, he earned two nicknames: Chefen fra Lokeren (Lit: The Boss from Lokeren) and Den Gale Mand fra Lokeren (Lit: The Crazy Man from Lokeren), surpassing the 100-goal mark in official matches (98 in the Belgian First Division alone). Verona Twenty-seven-year-old Elkj√¶r signed for Hellas Verona F.C. in Italy in the summer of 1984 and, in his first season with the team, he played an instrumental role as it won the Serie A title, the scudetto, for the first time in its history; he aided to that conquest with a solo left-flank run against Juventus FC (a 2‚Äì0 home win), where he lost his right boot, kept on running with the ball and ended up shooting home with his bootless right foot. In 1984, Elkj√¶r finished third and in 1985 second in the European Footballer of the Year awards, both times surpassed by Michel Platini, who played for Juventus. During his four-year spell at Verona, he never scored ten league goals in a season, but never netted fewer than seven goals, for a total of 48 official ones. Return to Denmark/Retirement In 1988, Elkj√¶r made a comeback in Danish football with Vejle BK. He came to the club as the biggest star in the country, and attracted great crowds to the club's matches. Aged already 31, he suffered a number of injuries while at Vejle, and had a hard time living up to the high expectations of the crowds, eventually retiring two years later, having only appeared a total of 26 matches combined. International career While playing youth football for Frederiksberg Boldklub, Elkj√¶r made his debut for the Danish under-19 national team, in October 1975. He played a total 11 games and scored six goals for the under-19 national team, including three in three games at the 1975 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. Elkj√¶r made his debut for the under-21s in June 1976, scoring nine times in as many games; this included three goals in the quarter-finals of the 1978 European Under-21 Championship against Bulgaria, though Denmark were eliminated on the away goals rule. On 22 June 1977, aged 19 years and 284 days, Elkj√¶r made his debut for the senior national team, scoring both goals in a 2‚Äì1 win against Finland. He played a prominent role in UEFA Euro 1984, scoring two goals in four games, which helped pave the way for his move to Italian football.Lundberg (1988), p.136 During the tournament, Denmark played attractive attacking football, but went out at the semi-final stage, losing to Spain on penalties. Elkj√¶r missed Denmark's last penalty kick attempt, sending the ball high over the goal. Elkj√¶r also represented Denmark at the 1986 FIFA World Cup as Denmark had qualified for that competition for the first time, eventually progressing from the group stage as winners, only to be once again knocked out by Spain. During the tournament, he scored four goals, including a hat-trick against Uruguay, being named the most dynamic and powerful striker of the tournament, and winning the Bronze Ball award as the third best player. Euro 1988 was Elkj√¶r's last tournament participation for him. On 14 June 1988, he played the last game for his country, aged 30 years and 277 days, as Denmark lost 0‚Äì2 to West Germany, finishing with three group stage defeats. In total, he played 69 international games, and scored 38 goals. Playing style Elkj√¶r is regarded as one of Denmark's all-time greatest forwards. A notorious smoker, his playing style was however not short of breath, being dominated by a rock-like determination. He never seemed to give up on a lost ball ‚Äì from time to time resulting in a goal. His style was an unorthodox combination of physical confrontationsLundberg (1988), p.109 and great dribbling abilities. Described as \\"powerful and dynamic\\", Elkj√¶r could hardly be stopped when going on his own, one of his trademarks. His aggression was matched by few, and whenever he would receive the ball with his back to the goal he would immediately turn with the ball and attempt to head for goal. Elkj√¶r's aggressive style of play was well combined with the calmness and vision of the younger Michael Laudrup when they played side by side on the national team, and they were named the \\"most effective\\" attacking duo of the 1986 World Cup. Retirement After his retirement from playing, Elkj√¶r took on the job as head coach of Silkeborg IF in the Danish Superliga in 1995. In December 1996, he left the club to head TV sports channel TVS, a newly formed corporation between national TV stations DR and TV2, the Danish Football Association and telecompany Tele Danmark. The station was not a success, and was closed within a year of its opening. Additionally, he worked as a UEFA Champions League pundit at Danish TV3+, alongside Brian Laudrup and host Peter Gr√∏nborg. In October 2019 he had an operation to remove a gallstone in Belgium. Honours Club ;1.

While the Veerashaiva- tradition incorporates Vedic elements, the origin of panchacharyas has been explained in Sivagamas, especially in Svayambhuva Agama, Suprabhedagama and Viragama.

Sant Tukaram Maharaj is best known for his devotional poetry called Abhanga and community-oriented worship with spiritual songs known as kirtans.Anna Schultz (2012), Singing a Hindu Nation: Marathi Devotional Performance and Nationalism, Oxford University Press, , page 26 His poetry was devoted to Vitthala or Vithoba. Tukaram was born in modern day Maharastra state of India. His complete name was Tukaram Bolhoba Ambile. The year of birth and death of sant Tukaram has been a subject of research and dispute among 20th-century scholars.RD Ranade (1994), Tukaram, State University of New York Press, , pages 1-7Richard M. Eaton (2005), A Social History of the Deccan, 1300‚Äì1761: Eight Indian Lives, Cambridge University Press, , pages 129-130 He was either born in the year 1598 or 1608 in a village named Dehu, near Pune in Maharashtra, India. Sant Tukaram was born to Kanakar and Bolhoba More and scholars consider his family to belong to the Kunbi caste. Tukaram's family owned a retailing and money-lending business as well as were engaged in agriculture and trade. His parents were devotees of Vithoba, an avatar of Hindu deity Vishnu (Vaishnavas). Both his parents died when Tukaram was a teenager. Sant Tukaram's first wife was Rakhama Bai, and they had a son named Santu.RD Ranade (1994), Saint Tukaram, State University of New York Press, , pages 7-9 However, both his son and wife starved to death in the famine of 1630‚Äì1632.SG Tulpule (1992), Devotional Literature in South Asia (Editor: RS McGregor), Cambridge University Press, , pages 150-152 The deaths and widespread poverty had a profound effect on Tukaram, who became contemplative, meditating on the hills of Sahyadri range (Western Ghats) and later wrote he \\"had discussions with my own self\\". Tukaram married again, and his second wife was Avalai Jija Bai. He spent most of his later years in devotional worship, community kirtans (group prayers with singing) and composing Abhanga poetry. id=ZOWIAwAAQBAJ&pg;=PP6|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1687-8|pages=9‚Äì11|date=January 1994}}Eleanor Zelliot (1976), Hinduism: New Essays in the History of Religions (Editor: Bardwell L Smith), Brill Academic, , pages 154-156 In his work of Abhangas, Tukarama repeatedly refers to four other persons who had a primary influence on his spiritual development, namely the earlier Bhakti Sants Namdev, Dnyaneshwar, Kabir and Eknath.RD Ranade (1994), Tukaram, State University of New York Press, , pages 10-12 According to some scholars, Tukaram met Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ‚Äì a leader who challenged the Mughal Empire and founded the Maratha kingdom;(Hindvi Swarajya) Their continued interaction is the subject of legends.Justin Edwards Abbott (2000), Life of Tukaram, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 320SG Tulpule (1992), Devotional Literature in South Asia (Editor: RS McGregor), Cambridge University Press, , pages 158-163 Eleanor Zelliot states that Bhakti movement poets including Tukaram were influential in Shivaji's rise to power. Tukaram disappeared (not died) in 1649 or 1650.RD Ranade (1994), Tukaram, State University of New York Press, , pages 1-2 Important Places associated with Tukaramji in Dehu that exist today are: *Tukaram Maharaj Janm Sthan Temple, Dehu ‚Äì place where Tukaramji was born, around which a temple was built later *Sant Tukaram Vaikunthstan Temple, Dehu ‚Äì from where Tukaramji ascended to Vaikunth in his mortal form; there is a nice ghat behind this temple along the Indrayani river *Sant Tukaram Maharaj Gatha Mandir, Dehu ‚Äì modern structure; massive building housing a big statue of Tukaram; In the Gatha temple, about 4,000 abhangs (verses) created by Tukaram maharaj were carved on the walls.  Literary works  Sant Tukaram composed Abhanga poetry, a Marathi genre of literature which is metrical (traditionally the ovi meter), simple, direct, and it fuses folk stories with deeper spiritual themes. Tukaram's work is known for informal verses of rapturous abandon in folksy style, composed in vernacular language, in contrast to his predecessors such as Dnyandeva or Namdev known for combining similar depth of thought with a grace of style. In one of his poems, Tukaram self-effacingly described himself as a \\"fool, confused, lost, liking solitude because I am wearied of the world, worshipping Vitthal (Vishnu) just like my ancestors were doing but I lack their faith and devotion, and there is nothing holy about me\\".SG Tulpule (1992), Devotional Literature in South Asia (Editor: RS McGregor), Cambridge University Press, , pages 149-150 Tukaram Gatha is a Marathi language compilation of his works, likely composed between 1632 and 1650.Mohan Lal (1993), Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay to Zorgot, Sahitya Akademi, South Asia Books, , pages 4404-4405 Also called Abhanga Gatha, the Indian tradition believes it includes some 4,500 abhangas, but modern scholars have questioned the authenticity of most of them. The poems considered authentic cover a wide range of human emotions and life experiences, some autobiographical, and places them in a spiritual context. He includes a discussion about the conflict between Pravritti ‚Äì having passion for life, family, business, and Nivritti ‚Äì the desire to renounce, leave everything behind for individual liberation, moksha. Ranade states there are four major collations of Tukaram's Abhanga Gathas.RD Ranade (1994), Tukaram, State University of New York Press, , pages 19-22  Authenticity  Numerous inconsistent manuscripts of Tukaram Gatha are known, and scholars doubt that most of the poems attributed to Tukaram are authentic. Of all manuscripts so far discovered, four are most studied and labelled as: the Dehu MS, the Kadusa MS, the Talegeon MS and the Pandharpur MS. Of these, the Dehu MS is most referred to because Indian tradition asserts that it is based on the writing of Tukaram's son Mahadeva, but there is no historical evidence that this is true.The Life and Teaching of Tukaram J Nelson Fraser, and JF Edwards, Probsthain, Christian Literature Society, pages 119-124 The first compilation of Tukaram poems were published, in modern format, by Indu Prakash publishers in 1869, subsidized by the British colonial government's Bombay Presidency. The 1869 edition noted, \\"some of the [as received] manuscripts on which the compilation relied, had been 'corrected', 'further corrected' and 'arranged'.\\" This doctoring and rewriting over about 200 years, after Tukaram's death, has raised questions whether modern compilation of Tukaram's poems faithfully represent what Tukaram actually thought and said, and the historicity of the document. The known manuscripts are jumbled, randomly scattered collections, without chronological sequence, and each contain some poems that are not found in all other known manuscripts.Dilip Chitre (1991), Says Tuka: Selected Poetry of Tukaram, Penguin,  Philosophy and practices  Early 20th-century scholars on Tukaram considered his teachings to be Vedanta-based but lacking a systematic theme. Edwards wrote, Late 20th-century scholarship of Tukaram, and translations of his Abhanga poem, affirm his pantheistic Vedantic view. Tukaram's Abhanga 2877, as translated by Shri Gurudev Ranade of Nimbal states, for example, \\"The Vedanta has said that the whole universe is filled by God. All sciences have proclaimed that God has filled the whole world. The Puranas have unmistakably taught the universal immanence of God. The sants have told us that the world is filled by God. Tuka indeed is playing in the world uncontaminated by it like the Sun which stands absolutely transcendent\\".RD Ranade (1994), Tukaram, State University of New York Press, , pages 192-197 Scholars note the often discussed controversy, particularly among Marathi people, whether Tukaram subscribed to the monistic Vedanta philosophy of Adi Shankara.R G Bhandarkar (2014), Vaisnavism, Saivism and Minor Religious Systems, Routledge, , pages 98-99Charles Eliot (1998), Hinduism and Buddhism: An Historical Sketch, Volume 2, Routledge, , page 258, Quote: \\"Maratha critics have discussed whether Tukaram followed the monistic philosophy of Sankara or more, and it must be confessed that his utterances are contradictory.\\" Bhandarkar notes that Abhanga 300, 1992 and 2482 attributed to Tukaram are in style and philosophy of Adi Shankara: However, scholars also note that other Abhangas attributed to Tukaram criticize monism, and favor dualistic Vedanta philosophy of the Indian philosophers Madhvacharya and Ramanuja. In Abhanga 1471, according to Bhandarkar's translation, Tukaram says, \\"When monism is expounded without faith and love, the expounder as well as the hearer are troubled and afflicted. He who calls himself Brahma and goes on in his usual way, should not be spoken to and is a buffoon. The shameless one who speaks heresy in opposition to the Vedas is an object of scorn among holy men.\\" The controversy about Tukaram's true philosophical positions has been complicated by questions of authenticity of poems attributed to him, discovery of manuscripts with vastly different number of his Abhang poems, and that Tukaram did not write the poems himself, they were written down much later, by others from memory.The Life and Teaching of Tukaram J Nelson Fraser, and JF Edwards, Probsthain, Christian Literature Society, pages 119-123, 218-221 Tukaram denounced mechanical rites, rituals, sacrifices, vows and instead encouraged direct form of bhakti (devotion).David Lorenzen (2006), Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History, Yoda Press, , page 130  Kirtan  Tukaram encouraged kirtan as a music imbued, community-oriented group singing and dancing form of bhakti. He considered kirtan not just a means to learn about Bhakti, but Bhakti itself. The greatest merit in kirtan, according to Tukaram, is it being not only a spiritual path for the devotee, it helps create a spiritual path for others.Anna Schultz (2012), Singing a Hindu Nation: Marathi Devotional Performance and Nationalism, Oxford University Press, , pages 25-28  Social reforms  Tukaram accepted disciples and devotees without discriminating gender. One of his celebrated devotees was Bahina Bai, a Brahmin woman, who faced anger and abuse of her husband when she chose Bhakti marga and Tukaram as her guru.Anne Feldhaus (1982), BahinƒÅBƒÅƒ´: Wife and Saint, Journal of American Academy of Religion, Volume L, Issue 4, pages 591-604 Tukaram taught, states Ranade, that \\"pride of caste never made any man holy\\", \\"the Vedas and Shastras have said that for the service of God, castes do not matter\\", \\"castes do not matter, it is God's name that matters\\", and \\"an outcast who loves the Name of God is verily a Brahmin; in him have tranquility, forbearance, compassion and courage made their home\\".RD Ranade (1994), Tukaram, State University of New York Press, , pages 154-156 However, early 20th century scholars questioned whether Tukaram himself observed caste when his daughters from his second wife married men of their own caste. Fraser and Edwards, in their 1921 review of Tukaram, stated that this is not necessarily so, because people in the West too generally prefer relatives to marry those of their own economic and social strata.The Life and Teaching of Tukaram J Nelson Fraser, and JF Edwards, Probsthain, Christian Literature Society, pages 163, 54-55 David Lorenzen states that the acceptance, efforts and reform role of Tukaram in the Varakari-sampraday follows the diverse caste and gender distributions found in Bhakti movements across India. Tukaram, of Shudra varna, was one of the nine non-Brahmins, of the twenty one considered sant in Varakari-sampraday tradition. The rest include ten Brahmins and two whose caste origins are unknown. Of the twenty one, four women are celebrated as sant, born in two Brahmin and two non-Brahmin families. Tukaram's effort at social reforms within Varakari-sampraday must be viewed in this historical context and as part of the overall movement, states Lorenzen.David Lorenzen (2006), Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History, Yoda Press, , pages 127-128  Legacy  Gatha temple in Dehu, near Pune Maharashtra, is one of two local temples that mark the legacy of Tukaram. His poetry is carved on its wall.Gatha Temple, National Geographic (2014) Tukaram was a devotee of Vitthala or Vithoba, an avatar of God Vishnu, synchronous with Krishna but with regional style and features. Tukaram's literary works, along with those of sants Dnyandev, Namdev and Eknath, states Mohan Lal, are credited to have propelled Varkari tradition into pan-Indian Bhakti literature.Mohan Lal (1993), Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay to Zorgot, Sahitya Akademi, South Asia Books, , page 4403 According to Richard Eaton, from early 14th- century when Maharashtra region came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate, down to the 17th-century, the legacy of Tukaram and his poet-predecessors, \\"gave voice to a deep-rooted collective identity among Marathi- speakers\\".Richard M. Eaton (2005), A Social History of the Deccan, 1300‚Äì1761: Eight Indian Lives, Cambridge University Press, , pages 138-141 Dilip Chitre summarizes the legacy of Tukaram and Bhakti movement sants, during this period of Hindu-Muslim wars, as transforming \\"language of shared religion, and religion a shared language. It is they who helped to bind the Marathas together against the Mughals on the basis not of any religious ideology but of a territorial cultural identity\\".Dilip Chitre (1991), Says Tuka: Selected Poetry of Tukaram, Penguin, , pages xvi-xvii Mahatma Gandhi, in early 20th century, while under arrest in Yerwada Central Jail by the British colonial government for his non-violent movement, read and translated Tukaram's poetry along with Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita and poems by other Bhakti movement poet- sants.MK Gandhi (1930), Songs from prison: translations of Indian Lyrics made in Jail, (Adapted and formatted by John Hoyland, 1934), New York : Macmillan, Sant Tukaram also had a profound influence on K. B. Hedgewar as the former's quotes often found their way on the latter's letterhead. One such letter dated April 6th 1940 bore the quote \\"Daya tiche nanwa bhutanche palan, aanik nirdalan kantkache\\", meaning compassion is not only the welfare of all living beings, but also includes protecting them from harm‚Äôs way.  Films and popular literature  Tukaram leaves for Vaikuntha, Supreme Abode of God Vishnu. *Sant Tukaram (1936) ‚Äì this movie on Tukaram was screened open-air for a year, to packed audiences in Mumbai, and numerous rural people would walk very long distances to see it.Prem Choudhary (2000), Colonial India and the Making of Empire Cinema, Manchester University Press, , page 155 *Santa Tukaram (1963) in Kannada *Sant Tukaram (1965) in Hindi *Bhakta Tukaram (1973) in Telugu *Tukaram (2012) in Marathi Tukaram's life was the subject of 68th issue of Amar Chitra Katha, India's largest comic book series.Lawrence Babb and Susan Wadley (1998), Media and the Transformation of Religion in South Asia, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 131 Government of India Issued 100 rupees Silver commemorative coin in 2002.100 rupees coin of 2002 ‚Äì Sant Tukaram, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiTy99JkIUU  Books and translations of Sant Tukaram  The 18th-century biographer Mahipati, in his four volume compilation of the lives of many Bhakti movement sants, included Tukaram.

The first machine came into service in 1964 and the last of 29 machines was decommissioned in 1980 at the National Physical Laboratory. The KDF9 was designed for, and used almost entirely in, the mathematical and scientific processing fields in 1967, nine were in use in UK universities and technical colleges. The KDF8, developed in parallel, was aimed at commercial processing workloads. The KDF9 was an early example of a machine that directly supported multiprogramming, using offsets into its core memory to separate the programs into distinct virtual address spaces. Several operating systems were developed for the platform, including some that provided fully interactive use through PDP-8 machines acting as smart terminal servers. A number of compilers were available, notably both checkout and globally optimizing compilers for Algol 60. Architecture The logic circuits of the KDF9 were entirely solid-state. The KDF9 used transformer-coupled diode‚Äìtransistor logic, built from germanium diodes, about 20,000 transistors, and about 2,000 toroid pulse transformers (magnetic amplifiers).\\"The KDF9 Computer - 30 Years On\\" They ran on a 1 MHz clock that delivered two pulses of 250 ns separated by 500 ns, in each clock cycle. The maximum configuration incorporated 32K words of 48-bit core storage (192K bytes) with a cycle time of 6 microseconds. Each word could hold a 48-bit integer or floating-point number, two 24-bit integer or floating-point numbers, six 8-bit instruction syllables, or eight 6-bit characters. There was also provision for efficient handling of double-word (96-bit) numbers in both integer and floating point formats. However, there was no facility for byte or character addressing, so that non-numerical work suffered by comparison. Its standard character set was a version of the Friden Flexowriter paper tape code that was oriented to Algol 60, and included unusual characters such as the Algol subscript 10. However, each other I/O device type implemented its own subset of that. Not every character that could be read from paper tape could be successfully printed, for example. Registers The CPU architecture featured three register sets. The Nest was a 16-deep pushdown stack of arithmetic registers, The SJNS (Subroutine Jump Nesting Store) was a similar stack of return addresses. The Q Store was a set of 16 index registers, each of 48 bits divided into Counter (C), Increment (I) and Modifier (M) parts of 16 bits each. Flags on a memory-reference instruction specified whether the address should be modified by the M part of a Q Store, and, if so, whether the C part should be decremented by 1 and the M part incremented by the contents of the I part. This made the coding of counting loops very efficient. Three additional Nest levels and one additional SJNS level were reserved to Director, the Operating System, allowing short-path interrupts to be handled without explicit register saving and restoring. As a result, the interrupt overhead was only 3 clock cycles. Instruction set Instructions were of 1, 2 or 3 syllables. Most arithmetic took place at the top of the Nest and used zero-address, 1-syllable instructions, although address arithmetic and index updating were handled separately in the Q store. Q Store handling, and some memory reference instructions used 2 syllables. Memory reference instructions with a 16-bit address offset, most jump instructions, and 16-bit literal load instructions, all used 3 syllables. Dense instruction coding, and intensive use of the register sets, meant that relatively few store accesses were needed for common scientific codes, such as scalar product and polynomial inner loops. This did much to offset the relatively slow core cycle time, giving the KDF9 about a third of the speed of its much more famous, but 8 times more expensive and much less commercially successful contemporary, the Manchester/Ferranti Atlas Computer. Multiprogramming (timesharing) The KDF9 was one of the earliest fully hardware-secured multiprogramming systems. Up to four programs could be run at once under the control of its elegantly simple operating system, the Timesharing Director, each being confined to its own core area by BA (Base Address) and NOL (Number of Locations) registers. Each program had its own sets of stack and Q store registers, which were activated when that program was dispatched, so that context switching was very efficient. Each program could drive hardware I/O devices directly, but was limited by hardware checks to those that the Director had allocated to it. Any attempt to use an unallocated device caused an error interrupt. A similar interrupt resulted from overfilling (or over-emptying) the Nest or SJNS, or attempting to access storage at an address above that given in the NOL register. Somewhat different was the Lock-Out interrupt, which resulted from trying to access an area of store that was currently being used by an I/O device, so that there was hardware mutual exclusion of access to DMA buffers. When a program blocked on a Lock-Out, or by voluntarily waiting for an I/O transfer to terminate, it was interrupted and Director switched to the program of highest priority that was not itself blocked. When a Lock-Out cleared, or an awaited transfer terminated, and the responsible program was of higher priority than the program currently running, the I/O Control (IOC) unit interrupted to allow an immediate context switch. IOC also made provision to avoid priority inversion, in which a program of high priority waits for a device made busy by a program of lower priority, requesting a distinct interrupt in that case. Later operating systems, including Eldon 2 at the University of Leeds, and COTAN, developed by UKAEA Culham Laboratories with the collaboration of Glasgow University, were fully interactive multi-access systems, with PDP-8 front ends to handle the terminals. The Kidsgrove and Whetstone Algol 60 compilers were among the first of their class. The Kidsgrove compiler stressed optimization; the Whetstone compiler produced an interpretive object code aimed at debugging. It was by instrumenting the latter that Brian Wichmann obtained the statistics on program behaviour that led to the Whetstone benchmark for scientific computation,Curnow, H. J. and Wichman, B. A. \\"A Synthetic Benchmark\\" Computer Journal, Volume 19, Issue 1, February 1976., pp. 43‚Äì49. which inspired in turn the Dhrystone benchmark for non-numerical workloads. Reminiscence Machine code orders were written in a form of octal officially named syllabic octal (also known as 'slob-octal' or 'slob' notation,). It represented 8 bits with three octal digits but the first digit represented only the two most-significant bits, whilst the others the remaining two groups of three bits each. Although the word 'byte' had been coined by the designers of the IBM 7030 Stretch for a group of eight bits, it was not yet well known, and English Electric used the word 'syllable' for what is now called a byte. Within English Electric, its predecessor, DEUCE, had a well-used matrix scheme based on GIP (General Interpretive Programme). The unreliability of valve machines led to the inclusion of a sum-check mechanism to detect errors in matrix operations. The scheme used block floating-point using fixed-point arithmetic hardware, in which the sum-checks were precise. However, when the corresponding scheme was implemented on KDF9, it used floating point, a new concept that had only limited mathematical analysis. It quickly became clear that sum checks were no longer precise and a project was established in an attempt to provide a usable check. (In floating point (A + B) + C is not necessarily the same as A + (B + C) i.e. the + operation is not associative.) Before long, however, it was recognized that error rates with transistor machines was not an issue; they either worked correctly or didn‚Äôt work at all. Consequently, the idea of sum checks was abandoned. The initial matrix package proved a very useful system testing tool as it was able to generate lengthy performance checks well before more formal test packages which were subsequently developed. KDF9 was developed as project KD9 (Kidsgrove Development 9) and that the 'F' in its designation was contributed by the then Chairman after a long and tedious discussion on what to name the machine at launch‚Äî\\"I don‚Äôt care if you call it the F‚Äî\\". See also KDF8 for the parallel development and use of a commercially oriented computer.) The Egdon operating system was so named because one was going to UKAEA Winfrith: in Thomas Hardy's book The Return of the Native Winfrith Heath is called Egdon Heath. Their Fortran was called Egtran. Eldon was so named because Leeds University's computer was located in a converted Eldon chapel. Physical The machine weighed more than .

In 2001 during the African Renaissance festival, his name was engraved on the entrance of the City Hall in Durban alongside those of Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Miriam Makeba and other heroes of the liberation struggle. As a librettist, Ngema has written the musical soundtrack for Sarafina - the movie and produced the movie's soundtrack alongside Quincy Jones. He has composed several music albums, including the famous and locally loved album Stimela SaseZola. Ngema has written and arranged numerous songs as well as arranged music for artists such as Michael Bolton. He was also one of the vocal arrangers for The Lion King, Disney's animated film. For this, Ngema received a multi-platinum award for sales in excess of 6 million copies. He subsequently won a Grammy Award for the movie adaptation. \\"Woza My Fohloza\\", the new millennium song, and several albums of his musicals are on Ngema's librettist list. In 1997, Ngema was appointed as a visiting lecturer at the University of Zululand to teach his unique artistic technique and subsequently produced the first CD released by the university's music department. In 2003 he was appointed as Artistic Director for the 2003 Cricket World Cup and in 2004 appointed as one of the organisers of the 10th Anniversary Celebrations of South Africa's democracy. He has been entrusted by the KZN Department of Arts, Sports and Recreation for establishing and managing the recording studio and record company, The KZN Music House managed by his company Committed Artists. Several books and academic work have been written about Mbongeni Ngema and his celebrated works, including Nothing Except Ourselves by Laura Jones (USA), The Best of Mbongeni Ngema, The man and his music by Isabel Cooke (RSA), An investigation into the creation and interpretation in Mbongeni Ngema‚Äôs intra-cultural Theatre ‚Äì N. O. Sabelo (UKZN Thesis). Ngema has tapped into his own richly-nurtured background of traditional story-telling, learned as a small child from his great- grandmother, to create his spell-binding one-man show, which melds memories of his childhood, spent in the heart of Zululand, with the wealth of his heritage, bringing vividly to life the historic panoply of the Zulu nation. The Zulu continues its triumphant tours of South Africa, filling theatres around the country, and is set to soon tour abroad. Ngema prides himself on being from the lineage of the warriors Mbandama and Sigcwelegcwele kaMhlekehleke of the Ngema clan who led the Ingoba Makhosi regiment, a pivotal regiment that defeated the British armies at the Battle of Isandlwana in the Anglo-Zulu war, on 22 January 1879. To add to the growing list of accolades, Ngema has recently been conferred with an honorary doctorate from the Good Shepherd College of Religion, Culture and skills training. This prestige was in honour and recognition of Ngema's service to South African music and on- going impact in the arts sector. Ngema was recently the recipient of a prestigious Life Time Achievement Award, presented to him at the Naledi Awards ceremony held in Johannesburg in 2014. Featuring Mbongeni Ngema has participated in a song called \\"Take This Song\\", recorded with the reggae band Third World.Third World - Take This Song, AllMusic. Mbongeni Ngema released Freedom is Coming Tomorrow (Remix) with Emtee, Saudi, Gigi Lamayne, Tamarsha, Reason, Blaklez & DJ Machaba Third World.Mbongeni Ngema released Freedom is Coming Tomorrow (Remix) with Emtee, Saudi, Gigi Lamayne, Tamarsha, Reason, Blaklez & DJ Machaba, Mzansimp3.  Controversies  Ngema composed a song called \\" Amandiya\\" which was critical of how the Indian people of KwaZulu Natal were treating its employees and paying them a pittance. This song was banned by the high court in South Africa and later an age restriction of 18 was allowed for the song to be in circulation again. Productions * Asinamali (1987) * Sarafina!

Four\\". The attack was captured on video by a news helicopter, and broadcast live on U.S. national television. Four other Black L.A. residents who had been witnessing the attack on live television came to Denny's aid, placing him back in his truck, in which one of the rescuers drove him to the hospital. Denny suffered a fractured skull and impairment of his speech and ability to walk, for which he underwent years of rehabilitative therapy. After unsuccessfully suing the City of Los Angeles, Denny moved to Arizona, where he worked as an independent boat mechanic and has mostly avoided media contact. Background On March 3, 1991, an amateur video recording showed motorist Rodney King being badly beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers during an arrest. The outrage resulting from the acquittal of these police officers was the principal cause of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Born in 1953 in Lansing, Michigan, Reginald Oliver Denny was a 39-year-old truck driver at the time of the attack. His parents moved to Sylmar, Los Angeles, when he was a child. Denny divorced from his first wife in 1986. Attack In what has been called an \\"iconic image\\" of the L.A. uprising, video footage from the Los Angeles News Service helicopter showed Denny being pulled from his truck and beaten with fists, kicked, and struck with a cinder block during the first day of rioting. Timothy Goldman, a local resident who was filming on the ground at the corner of Florence and Normandie Avenues, captured a part of the scene. The attack has been described as a hate crime in which Denny, a White man, was targeted for his race in response to police brutality against King and the belief that the criminal justice system had failed to protect King‚Äôs civil rights.Damian Williams throwing a cinder block at Denny's head, then executing a football- style victory. On April 29, 1992, at 5:39 pm, Denny loaded his red dump truck with of sand and began driving to a plant in Inglewood, where the sand was due. He left the Santa Monica Freeway and took a familiar shortcut across Florence Avenue to get to his destination. He was listening to the radio, \\"probably KKLA, a Christian channel,\\" Denny said, \\"or country station KZLA.\\" At 6:46 pm, after he entered the intersection at Normandie, rioters threw rocks at his windows, and he heard people shouting for him to stop, forcing him to do so in the middle of the street. Antoine Miller climbed up and opened the truck door, giving an unidentified man the chance to pull Denny out and throw him on the ground. Henry Watson stood on Denny's neck to hold him down as a group of men surrounded him and Anthony Brown kicked him in the abdomen. As Watson walked away, two other unidentified men joined in the attack: one hurled a five-pound oxygenator stolen from Larry Tarvin's truck at Denny's head, and the other kicked him and hit him with a claw hammer. News footage showed Damian Williams throwing a cinder block at Denny's head, then doing a football-style victory dance in the road and flashing gang signs at the Los Angeles News Service helicopter of Robert Tur and Marika Gerrard. After the beating ended, some men threw beer bottles at the unconscious body and a man searched Denny's back pockets, taking his wallet. Tur and Gerrard reported that there was no police presence in the area. Four Black residents of South Central Los Angeles, Bobby Green Jr., Lei Yuille, Titus Murphy, and Terri Barnett, who had been watching the events on television, came to Denny's aid. Green, also a truck driver, boarded Denny's truck and took over at the wheel and drove him to the Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood. Paramedics who attended to Denny said he suffered major trauma and came very close to dying. Soon after Green took him to the hospital, Denny suffered a seizure. His skull was fractured in 91 places and pushed into his brain. His left eye was so badly dislocated that it would have fallen into his sinus cavity had the surgeons not replaced the crushed bone with a piece of plastic. A permanent crater remains in his forehead despite efforts to correct it. The \\"L.A. Four\\" The \\"L.A. Four\\" was a nickname given to the first four men charged with the attack on Denny: Damian Williams, Henry Watson, Antoine Miller, and Gary Williams. Considered the most high-profile member of the four, Damian Monroe Williams (born March 17, 1973), nicknamed \\"Football\\", was a 19-year-old former high-school football star. Williams was identified on the video recording thanks to a large tattoo on his left arm related to the Crips street gang. He was mentioned in news reports and court records as a member of the 71 Hustlers, an affiliation of the Eight Trey Gangster Crips. Williams had several juvenile arrests but no convictions. His friends recalled him as being generous to children and devoted to caring for an older brother who had been beaten in a robbery. Williams faced the most serious charges of the four, and was eventually convicted of four misdemeanors and simple mayhem. He was paroled after serving four years of his 10-year sentence. After his release, he was arrested and convicted for his role in the 2000 murder of a drug dealer, and sentenced to 46 years in prison. Henry Keith Watson was a 27-year- old former US Marine and an ex-convict who had served time for armed robbery. After his release from prison, he married, had a daughter, and was working two jobs at the time of the incident. Antoine Eugene Miller (May 5, 1972 ‚Äì February 8, 2004) was a 19-year-old who lived with Damian Williams' family. Miller's mother was not able to care for him, so as a child, Miller was sent to live with his grandmother. When he was 12, his grandmother killed his grandfather during an argument and was convicted of his murder, leaving Miller homeless. Miller had previously been arrested for misdemeanor drug charges, joyriding, and failing to appear in court. Miller was shot and killed at age 31 in a Hollywood nightclub in February 2004. Gary Anthony Williams was a 33-year-old man described as a \\"drifter\\" and a \\"hustler\\" who begged at a local gas station. Although he claimed to work there, his arrest record listed him as unemployed. Trials On May 12, outgoing Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates started a search for three of Denny's attackers, who were identified from the video of the beating. Gates himself arrested Damian Williams, while other officers arrested Henry Watson and Antoine Miller. Soon afterward, Gary Williams gave himself up to the police. The four arrested men were suspected to be part of the 83 Gangster Crips. Judge John W. Ouderkirk granted Miller a separate trial on the grounds that the strong evidence against Watson and Damian Williams could harm his case; Miller was sentenced to 17 months in jail and 27 months on probation. Gary Williams was sentenced to three years in jail for attempting to rob Denny and assaulting another man. Edi M.O. Faal was Damian Williams' defense attorney, and Earl C. Broadly was Henry Watson's. On July 28, 1993, Watson's and Williams' trial began. The two were charged with the assault of Denny as well as five other motorists and two firefighters who were driving past the intersection of Florence and Normandie shortly after the start of the Los Angeles riots on April 29. At the trial, Denny faced his attackers for the first time since they had assaulted him. On August 12, 1993, a jury of five Whites, three Blacks, three Latinos, and one Asian was chosen. On August 19, Deputy District Attorney Lawrence Morrison delivered the opening statement and a week later, the videotape of the beating was shown. The doctors who treated Denny testified, describing his wounds and their efforts to repair them. Next to testify were witnesses of the beating and Denny's rescuers. The prosecution rested on September 17, 1993. The defense began pleading on September 20, making a case for unpremeditated assault, with Faal challenging the video evidence and portraying Williams as a victim of poverty and racism. In the closing arguments, the defense attorneys claimed that Williams and Watson were being used as scapegoats for the L.A. riots. The prosecution counter-argued that the two had knowingly tried to kill Denny and were not victims. Williams' lawyers successfully argued that he had not intended to kill Denny; he was found not guilty of attempted murder, assault, and aggravated mayhem, and convicted of four misdemeanors and simple mayhem, while Watson was convicted of a single misdemeanor assault charge. During a break in the trial, Denny approached Williams' mother, Georgiana, and hugged her. Watson was given credit for time served and was sentenced to three years' probation for the assaults of Denny and truck driver Larry Tarvin. Williams was denied bail and sentenced to a maximum of ten years for the assaults of Denny and four other people on December 7, 1993. Aftermath Denny sought to soothe the racial tensions of the uprising in which he was attacked, reminding reporters that most of his rescuers were Black, as were the doctors who treated him. He became friends with the four persons that saved him, and Green was hired by Denny's employer Transit Mixed. Denny also sought to make peace with his attackers' families, saying that Watson had \\"been through quite enough\\" having been jailed for 17 months awaiting trial. Watson later apologized to Denny during an appearance on the Phil Donahue Show, where the pair shook hands. As a result of the injuries he suffered during the attacks, Denny had to undergo years of rehabilitative therapy, and his speech and ability to walk were also damaged. During his recovery, he received over 27,000 get-well cards from supportive members of the community. After unsuccessfully suing the city of Los Angeles, Denny moved to Arizona, near Lake Havasu, to work as an independent boat motor mechanic. Denny has largely avoided the media and rarely spoken publicly about his ordeal. In 1997, Damian Williams was released from prison early for good behavior, but in 2003, he was sentenced to 46 years to life in prison for the 2000 murder of drug dealer Grover Tinner. As of 2017, he is incarcerated at Centinela State Prison. Watson was re-arrested and sentenced to three years for a narcotics conviction, and after his release, owned and operated a limousine service in Los Angeles. On February 1, 2004, Antoine Miller was shot outside of a Hollywood nightclub during an altercation and died in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on February 8 at the age of 31. Gary Williams, Henry Watson, and Damian Williams gave interviews about the riots for the 2017 documentary Let It Fall: Los Angeles 1982‚Äì1992. Related litigation The best available footage of Denny's beating on April 29, 1992, was filmed by Marika Tur from a helicopter piloted by her then-spouse, reporter Robert Tur. Together, they operated a company called Los Angeles News Service (LANS). In the rush to cover the riots as they developed, dozens of television networks and stations around the world simply copied and aired the LANS footage without permission. LANS sued nearly all of them in federal court for copyright infringement; at least one of these lawsuits was successful. The last case was finally settled in 2004. Only a handful of stations, mostly in California, already had preexisting agreements with LANS or waited to negotiate agreements before airing the footage, and thus were not sued. In July 2006, LANS sued the site YouTube in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, for copyright infringement. LANS alleged in the lawsuit that, in the space of one week, a version of the video uploaded by a YouTube user was viewed over 1,000 times via the site. They argued this hurt their ability to license the video. YouTube requested summary judgment based on DMCA safe harbor, which was denied. LANS voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice, planning to join a class action against YouTube in New York. YouTube appealed both the dismissal and the summary judgment ruling. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal.

It was known by different regional names and fell under different forms of tax assessment. England The carucate was named for the carruca heavy plough that began to appear in England in the 9th century, It was also known as a ploughland or plough (, \\"plough's land\\") in the Danelaw usually but not always excluded the land's suitability for winter vegetables and desirability to remain fallow in crop rotation. The tax levied on each carucate came to be known as \\"carucage\\". Though a carucate might nominally be regarded as an area of 120 acres (49 hectares), and can usefully be equated to certain definitions of the hide, its variation over time and depending on soil and fertility makes its actual figure wildly variable.See e.g. Stenton, F.M., 'Introduction', in Foster, C.W. & Longley, T. (eds.), The Lincolnshire Domesday and the Lindsey Survey, Lincoln Record Society, XIX, 1924, especially pp. ix-xix. The Danelaw carucates were subdivided into eighths: oxgangs or bovates based on the area a single ox could till in a year. In the rest of England, the land was reckoned in hides which were divided into four yardlands, later known as virgates. Scotland A ploughgate was the Scottish equivalent in the south and east of the country. Even more so than in England, the variable land quality in Scotland led to ploughgates of varying sizes, although the area was notionally understood as 100 Scots acres. Many sources say that four ploughgates made up a daugh, but in other places it would have appeared to have been the equivalent of one daugh exactly. As in the Danelaw, ploughgates were subdivided into oxgangs, again usually by eighths.

The brown basilisk has large hind feet with flaps of skin between each toe. The fact that they move quickly across the water, aided by their web-like feet, gives them the appearance of \\"walking on water\\". Description The male brown basilisk can reach in total length (including tail), but the female is somewhat smaller. It has a three-part dorsal crest on the head, along the back, and along the tail. Coloration is brown or olive brown with black crossbands. The crossbands are usually only on the flanks and on the dorsal crest. There is also a white stripe, which extends from the eyes to the rear legs. The male has a larger crest than the female. The brown basilisk weighs . It has long toes with sharp claws. Etymology and taxonomy The brown basilisk's generic name Basiliscus is taken from the creature of Greek mythology made up of parts of a rooster, snake, and lion that could turn a man to stone by its gaze: the basilisk. This name derives from the Greek basil√≠skos (Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøœÇ) meaning \\"little king\\". This generic name was given in Carl Linnaeus' 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Running on water Costa Rica Smaller brown basilisks can run about on the water without sinking. Young brown basilisks can usually run farther than older ones. If the animal faces danger, it starts to run very fast on the surface of a river or a lake. Then the flaps on its hind feet are opened and thus more surface area is provided for it to run on water. Behavior Basiliscus vittatus is in the same infraorder as the family Iguanidae. Like most reptiles, the brown basilisk is active during the day. Its outstanding camouflage allows it to remain motionless and very hard to detect. The maximum lifespan of the brown basilisk is probably around 7‚Äì8 years. In the wild, most die much sooner. Reproduction Female brown basilisks lay about 2‚Äì18 eggs, five to eight times a year. Eggs hatch after about three months and the babies weigh about .

The log may be based either on visual inspection of samples brought to the surface (geological logs) or on physical measurements made by instruments lowered into the hole (geophysical logs). Some types of geophysical well logs can be done during any phase of a well's history: drilling, completing, producing, or abandoning. Well logging is performed in boreholes drilled for the oil and gas, groundwater, mineral and geothermal exploration, as well as part of environmental and geotechnical studies. Wireline logging Wireline log consisting of caliper, density and resistivity logs Wireline log consisting of a complete set of logs The oil and gas industry uses wireline logging to obtain a continuous record of a formation's rock properties. Wireline logging can be defined as being \\"The acquisition and analysis of geophysical data performed as a function of well bore depth, together with the provision of related services.\\" Note that \\"wireline logging\\" and \\"mud logging\\" are not the same, yet are closely linked through the integration of the data sets. The measurements are made referenced to \\"TAH\\" - True Along Hole depth: these and the associated analysis can then be used to infer further properties, such as hydrocarbon saturation and formation pressure, and to make further drilling and production decisions. Wireline logging is performed by lowering a 'logging tool' - or a string of one or more instruments - on the end of a wireline into an oil well (or borehole) and recording petrophysical properties using a variety of sensors. Logging tools developed over the years measure the natural gamma ray, electrical, acoustic, stimulated radioactive responses, electromagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance, pressure and other properties of the rocks and their contained fluids. For this article, they are broadly broken down by the main property that they respond to. The data itself is recorded either at surface (real-time mode), or in the hole (memory mode) to an electronic data format and then either a printed record or electronic presentation called a \\"well log\\" is provided to the client, along with an electronic copy of the raw data. Well logging operations can either be performed during the drilling process (see Logging While Drilling), to provide real-time information about the formations being penetrated by the borehole, or once the well has reached Total Depth and the whole depth of the borehole can be logged. Real-time data is recorded directly against measured cable depth. Memory data is recorded against time, and then depth data is simultaneously measured against time. The two data sets are then merged using the common time base to create an instrument response versus depth log. Memory recorded depth can also be corrected in exactly the same way as real-time corrections are made, so there should be no difference in the attainable TAH accuracy. The measured cable depth can be derived from a number of different measurements, but is usually either recorded based on a calibrated wheel counter, or (more accurately) using magnetic marks which provide calibrated increments of cable length. The measurements made must then be corrected for elastic stretch and temperature.Harald Bolt, Wireline Depth Determination, Rev 3.3, Apr 2012, available via Society of Professional Well Log Analysts web site, www.spwla.org There are many types of wireline logs and they can be categorized either by their function or by the technology that they use. \\"Open hole logs\\" are run before the oil or gas well is lined with pipe or cased. \\"Cased hole logs\\" are run after the well is lined with casing or production pipe. Wireline logs can be divided into broad categories based on the physical properties measured. History Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger, who founded Schlumberger Limited in 1926, are considered the inventors of electric well logging. Conrad developed the Schlumberger array, which was a technique for prospecting for metal ore deposits, and the brothers adapted that surface technique to subsurface applications. On September 5, 1927, a crew working for Schlumberger lowered an electric sonde or tool down a well in Pechelbronn, Alsace, France creating the first well log. In modern terms, the first log was a resistivity log that could be described as 3.5-meter upside-down lateral log. In 1931, Henri George Doll and G. Dechatre, working for Schlumberger, discovered that the galvanometer wiggled even when no current was being passed through the logging cables down in the well. This led to the discovery of the spontaneous potential (SP) which was as important as the ability to measure resistivity. The SP effect was produced naturally by the borehole mud at the boundaries of permeable beds. By simultaneously recording SP and resistivity, loggers could distinguish between permeable oil-bearing beds and impermeable nonproducing beds. In 1940, Schlumberger invented the spontaneous potential dipmeter; this instrument allowed the calculation of the dip and direction of the dip of a layer. The basic dipmeter was later enhanced by the resistivity dipmeter (1947) and the continuous resistivity dipmeter (1952). Oil-based mud (OBM) was first used in Rangely Field, Colorado in 1948. Normal electric logs require a conductive or water-based mud, but OBMs are nonconductive. The solution to this problem was the induction log, developed in the late 1940s. The introduction of the transistor and integrated circuits in the 1960s made electric logs vastly more reliable. Computerization allowed much faster log processing, and dramatically expanded log data-gathering capacity. The 1970s brought more logs and computers. These included combo type logs where resistivity logs and porosity logs were recorded in one pass in the borehole. The two types of porosity logs (acoustic logs and nuclear logs) date originally from the 1940s. Sonic logs grew out of technology developed during World War II. Nuclear logging has supplemented acoustic logging, but acoustic or sonic logs are still run on some combination logging tools. Nuclear logging was initially developed to measure the natural gamma radiation emitted by underground formations. However, the industry quickly moved to logs that actively bombard rocks with nuclear particles. The gamma ray log, measuring the natural radioactivity, was introduced by Well Surveys Inc. in 1939, and the WSI neutron log came in 1941. The gamma ray log is particularly useful as shale beds which often provide a relatively low permeability cap over hydrocarbon reservoirs usually display a higher level of gamma radiation. These logs were important because they can be used in cased wells (wells with production casing). WSI quickly became part of Lane-Wells. During World War II, the US Government gave a near wartime monopoly on open-hole logging to Schlumberger, and a monopoly on cased-hole logging to Lane-Wells.Now a division of Baker Hughes Nuclear logs continued to evolve after the war. After the discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance by Bloch and Purcell in 1946, the nuclear magnetic resonance log using the Earth's field was developed in the early 1950s by Chevron and Schlumberger. Nicolaas Bloembergen filed the Schlumberger patent in 1966. The NMR log was a scientific success but an engineering failure. More recent engineering developments by NUMAR (a subsidiary of Halliburton) in the 1990s has resulted in continuous NMR logging technology which is now applied in the oil and gas, water and metal exploration industry. Many modern oil and gas wells are drilled directionally. At first, loggers had to run their tools somehow attached to the drill pipe if the well was not vertical. Modern techniques now permit continuous information at the surface. This is known as logging while drilling (LWD) or measurement- while-drilling (MWD). MWD logs use mud pulse technology to transmit data from the tools on the bottom of the drillstring to the processors at the surface. Electrical logs Resistivity log Resistivity logging measures the subsurface electrical resistivity, which is the ability to impede the flow of electric current. This helps to differentiate between formations filled with salty waters (good conductors of electricity) and those filled with hydrocarbons (poor conductors of electricity). Resistivity and porosity measurements are used to calculate water saturation. Resistivity is expressed in ohms or ohms/meter, and is frequently charted on a logarithm scale versus depth because of the large range of resistivity. The distance from the borehole penetrated by the current varies with the tool, from a few centimeters to one meter. Borehole Imaging The term \\"borehole imaging\\" refers to those logging and data-processing methods that are used to produce centimeter-scale images of the borehole wall and the rocks that make it up. The context is, therefore, that of open hole, but some of the tools are closely related to their cased-hole equivalents. Borehole imaging has been one of the most rapidly advancing technologies in wireline well logging. The applications range from detailed reservoir description through reservoir performance to enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. Specific applications are fracture identification Taherdangkoo, R., & Abdideh, M. (2016). Application of wavelet transform to detect fractured zones using conventional well logs data (Case study: Southwest of Iran). International Journal of Petroleum Engineering, 2(2), 125-139., analysis of small-scale sedimentological features, evaluation of net pay in thinly bedded formations, and the identification of breakouts (irregularities in the borehole wall that are aligned with the minimum horizontal stress and appear where stresses around the wellbore exceed the compressive strength of the rock).http://petrowiki.org/Borehole_imaging The subject area can be classified into four parts: # Optical imaging # Acoustic imaging # Electrical imaging # Methods that draw on both acoustic and electrical imaging techniques using the same logging tool Porosity logs Porosity logs measure the fraction or percentage of pore volume in a volume of rock. Most porosity logs use either acoustic or nuclear technology. Acoustic logs measure characteristics of sound waves propagated through the well-bore environment. Nuclear logs utilize nuclear reactions that take place in the downhole logging instrument or in the formation. Nuclear logs include density logs and neutron logs, as well as gamma ray logs which are used for correlation. The basic principle behind the use of nuclear technology is that a neutron source placed near the formation whose porosity is being measured will result in neutrons being scattered by the hydrogen atoms, largely those present in the formation fluid. Since there is little difference in the neutrons scattered by hydrocarbons or water, the porosity measured gives a figure close to the true physical porosity whereas the figure obtained from electrical resistivity measurements is that due to the conductive formation fluid. The difference between neutron porosity and electrical porosity measurements therefore indicates the presence of hydrocarbons in the formation fluid. Density The density log measures the bulk density of a formation by bombarding it with a radioactive source and measuring the resulting gamma ray count after the effects of Compton Scattering and Photoelectric absorption. This bulk density can then be used to determine porosity. Neutron porosity The neutron porosity log works by bombarding a formation with high energy epithermal neutrons that lose energy through elastic scattering to near thermal levels before being absorbed by the nuclei of the formation atoms. Depending on the particular type of neutron logging tool, either the gamma ray of capture, scattered thermal neutrons or scattered, higher energy epithermal neutrons are detected.Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary The neutron porosity log is predominantly sensitive to the quantity of hydrogen atoms in a particular formation, which generally corresponds to rock porosity. Boron is known to cause anomalously low neutron tool count rates due to it having a high capture cross section for thermal neutron absorption. An increase in hydrogen concentration in clay minerals has a similar effect on the count rate. Sonic A sonic log provides a formation interval transit time, which typically a function of lithology and rock texture but particularly porosity. The logging tool consists of a piezoelectric transmitter and receiver and the time taken to for the sound wave to travel the fixed distance between the two is recorded as an interval transit time. Lithology logs Gamma ray A log of the natural radioactivity of the formation along the borehole, measured in API units, particularly useful for distinguishing between sands and shales in a siliclastic environment. This is because sandstones are usually nonradioactive quartz, whereas shales are naturally radioactive due to potassium isotopes in clays, and adsorbed uranium and thorium. In some rocks, and in particular in carbonate rocks, the contribution from uranium can be large and erratic, and can cause the carbonate to be mistaken for a shale. In this case, the carbonate gamma ray is a better indicator of shaliness. The carbonate gamma ray log is a gamma ray log from which the uranium contribution has been subtracted. Self/spontaneous potential The Spontaneous Potential (SP) log measures the natural or spontaneous potential difference between the borehole and the surface, without any applied current. It was one of the first wireline logs to be developed, found when a single potential electrode was lowered into a well and a potential was measured relative to a fixed reference electrode at the surface. The most useful component of this potential difference is the electrochemical potential because it can cause a significant deflection in the SP response opposite permeable beds. The magnitude of this deflection depends mainly on the salinity contrast between the drilling mud and the formation water, and the clay content of the permeable bed. Therefore, the SP log is commonly used to detect permeable beds and to estimate clay content and formation water salinity. The SP log can be used to distinguish between impermeable shale and permeable shale and porous sands. Miscellaneous Caliper A tool that measures the diameter of the borehole, using either 2 or 4 arms. It can be used to detect regions where the borehole walls are compromised and the well logs may be less reliable. Nuclear magnetic resonance Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging uses the NMR response of a formation to directly determine its porosity and permeability, providing a continuous record along the length of the borehole.Gluyas, J. & Swarbrick, R. (2004) Petroleum Geoscience. Publ. Blackwell PublishingNuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ‚Äì Technology of the 21st century. Kenyon, Kleinberg, Straley, Gubelin, and Morris. Oilfield Review. http://eps.mcgill.ca/~courses/c550/Literature/NMR-21st-century.pdf The chief application of the NMR tool is to determine moveable fluid volume (BVM) of a rock. This is the pore space excluding clay bound water (CBW) and irreducible water (BVI). Neither of these are moveable in the NMR sense, so these volumes are not easily observed on older logs. On modern tools, both CBW and BVI can often be seen in the signal response after transforming the relaxation curve to the porosity domain. Note that some of the moveable fluids (BVM) in the NMR sense are not actually moveable in the oilfield sense of the word. Residual oil and gas, heavy oil, and bitumen may appear moveable to the NMR precession measurement, but these will not necessarily flow into a well bore.https://www.spec2000.net/07-nmrlog.htm Spectral noise logging Spectral noise logging (SNL) is an acoustic noise measuring technique used in oil and gas wells for well integrity analysis, identification of production and injection intervals and hydrodynamic characterisation of the reservoir. SNL records acoustic noise generated by fluid or gas flow through the reservoir or leaks in downhole well components. Noise logging tools have been used in the petroleum industry for several decades. As far back as 1955, an acoustic detector was proposed for use in well integrity analysis to identify casing holes.Enright, R.J. 1955. Sleuth for Down-Hole Leaks, Oil & Gas J.:78-79 Over many years, downhole noise logging tools proved effective in inflow and injectivity profiling of operating wells,Britt E.L. 1976.

Characterizing Sound Generated by Multiphase Flow, SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition held in Houston, Texas Robinson (1974) described how noise logging can be used to determine effective reservoir thickness.Robinson W.S. 1974. Field Results From the Noise-Logging Technique, 49th Annual Fall Meeting of the SPE of AIME in Houston, Texas  Logging while drilling  In the 1970s, a new approach to wireline logging was introduced in the form of logging while drilling (LWD). This technique provides similar well information to conventional wireline logging but instead of sensors being lowered into the well at the end of wireline cable, the sensors are integrated into the drill string and the measurements are made in real-time, whilst the well is being drilled. This allows drilling engineers and geologists to quickly obtain information such as porosity, resistivity, hole direction and weight-on-bit and they can use this information to make immediate decisions about the future of the well and the direction of drilling.Rigzone How Does Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) Work? In LWD, measured data is transmitted to the surface in real time via pressure pulses in the well's mud fluid column. This mud telemetry method provides a bandwidth of less than 10 bits per second, although, as drilling through rock is a fairly slow process, data compression techniques mean that this is an ample bandwidth for real-time delivery of information. A higher sample rate of data is recorded into memory and retrieved when the drillstring is withdrawn at bit changes. High-definition downhole and subsurface information is available through networked or wired drillpipe that deliver memory quality data in real time. Corrosion well logging Throughout the life of the wells, integrity controles of the steel and cemented column (casing and tubing) are performed using calipers and thickness gauges. These advanced technical methods use non destructive technologies as ultrasonic, electromagnetic and magnetic transducers.St√©phane Sainson, Les diagraphies de corrosion. Ed. Lavoisier, 548 p., 2010 Memory log This method of data acquisition involves recording the sensor data into a down hole memory, rather than transmitting \\"Real Time\\" to surface. There are some advantages and disadvantages to this memory option. *The tools can be conveyed into wells where the trajectory is deviated or extended beyond the reach of conventional Electric Wireline cables. This can involve a combination of weight to strength ratio of the electric cable over this extended reach. In such cases the memory tools can be conveyed on Pipe or Coil Tubing. *The type of sensors are limited in comparison to those used on Electric Line, and tend to be focussed on the cased hole, production stage of the well. Although there are now developed some memory \\"Open Hole\\" compact formation evaluation tool combinations. These tools can be deployed and carried downhole concealed internally in drill pipe to protect them from damage while running in the hole, and then \\"Pumped\\" out the end at depth to initiate logging. Other basic open hole formation evaluation memory tools are available for use in \\"Commodity\\" markets on slickline to reduce costs and operating time. *In cased hole operation there is normally a \\"Slick Line\\" intervention unit. This uses a solid mechanical wire (0.072 - 0.125 inches in OD), to manipulate or otherwise carry out operations in the well bore completion system. Memory operations are often carried out on this Slickline conveyance in preference to mobilizing a full service Electric Wireline unit. *Since the results are not known until returned to surface, any realtime well dynamic changes cannot be monitored real time. This limits the ability to modify or change the well down hole production conditions accurately during the memory logging by changing the surface production rates. Something that is often done in Electric Line operations. *Failure during recording is not known until the memory tools are retrieved. This loss of data can be a major issue on large offshore (expensive) locations. On land locations (e.g. South Texas, US) where there is what is called a \\"Commodity\\" Oil service sector, where logging often is without the rig infrastructure. this is less problematic, and logs are often run again without issue. Coring An example of a granite core Coring is the process of obtaining an actual sample of a rock formation from the borehole. There are two main types of coring: 'full coring', in which a sample of rock is obtained using a specialised drill-bit as the borehole is first penetrating the formation and 'sidewall coring', in which multiple samples are obtained from the side of the borehole after it has penetrated through a formation. The main advantage of sidewall coring over full coring are that it is cheaper (drilling doesn't have to be stopped) and multiple samples can be easily acquired, with the main disadvantages being that there can be uncertainty in the depth at which the sample was acquired and the tool can fail to acquire the sample.Halliburton. Sidewall Coring Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary. Core Mudlogging Mud logs are well logs prepared by describing rock or soil cuttings brought to the surface by mud circulating in the borehole. In the oil industry they are usually prepared by a mud logging company contracted by the operating company. One parameter a typical mud log displays is the formation gas (gas units or ppm). \\"The gas recorder usually is scaled in terms of arbitrary gas units, which are defined differently by the various gas-detector manufactures. In practice, significance is placed only on relative changes in the gas concentrations detected.\\" The current oil industry standard mud log normally includes real-time drilling parameters such as rate of penetration (ROP), lithology, gas hydrocarbons, flow line temperature (temperature of the drilling fluid) and chlorides but may also include mud weight, estimated pore pressure and corrected d-exponent (corrected drilling exponent) for a pressure pack log. Other information that is normally notated on a mud log include directional data (deviation surveys), weight on bit, rotary speed, pump pressure, pump rate, viscosity, drill bit info, casing shoe depths, formation tops, mud pump info, to name just a few. Information use In the oil industry, the well and mud logs are usually transferred in 'real time' to the operating company, which uses these logs to make operational decisions about the well, to correlate formation depths with surrounding wells, and to make interpretations about the quantity and quality of hydrocarbons present. Specialists involved in well log interpretation are called log analysts.

This particular one is a stand-alone model. A carport is a covered structure used to offer limited protection to vehicles, primarily cars, from rain and snow. The structure can either be free standing or attached to a wall. Unlike most structures, a carport does not have four walls, and usually has one or two. Carports offer less protection than garages but allow for more ventilation. In particular, a carport prevents frost on the windshield. A \\"mobile\\" and/or \\"enclosed\\" carport has the same purpose as a standard carport. However, it may be removed/relocated and is typically framed with tubular steel and may have canvas or vinyl type covering which encloses the complete frame, including walls. It may have an accessible front entry or open entryway not typically attached to any structure or fastened in place by permanent means put held in place by stakes. It is differentiated from a tent by its main purpose: to house vehicles and/or motorized equipment(a tent is to shelter people). History The term carport comes from the French term porte-coch√®re, referring to a covered portal. Renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright coined the term when he used a carport in the first of his \\"Usonian\\" home designs: the house of Herbert Jacobs, built in 1936 in Madison, Wisconsin. Quoting from the Carport Integrity Policy for the Arizona State Historic Preservation Office: > As early as 1909, carports were used by the Prairie School architect Walter > Burley Griffin in his design for the Sloane House in Elmhurst, Illinois > (Gebhard, 1991: 110). By 1913, carports were also being employed by other > Prairie School architects such as the Minneapolis firm of Purcell, Feick & > Elmslie in their design for a residence at Lockwood Lake, Wisconsin. In this > instance, the carport was termed an \\"Auto Space\\" (Gebhard, 1991: 110). The > late architectural historian David Gebhard suggested that the term \\"carport\\" > originated from the feature‚Äôs use in 1930s Streamline Moderne residences > (Gebhard, 1991: 107). This term, which entered popular jargon in 1939, > stemmed from the visual connection between these streamlined residences and > nautical imagery. In the 1930s through the 1950s, carports were also being > used by Frank Lloyd Wright in his Usonian Houses, an idea that he may have > gotten from Griffin, a former associate. The W. B. Sloane House in Elmhurst, Illinois, in 1910, is credited as being the first known home designed with a carport. In describing the carport to Mr. Jacob, architect Wright said, \\"A car is not a horse, and it doesn't need a barn.\\" He then added, \\"Cars are built well enough now so that they do not require elaborate shelter.\\" Cars prior to this time were not completely water tight; the era of robotic-assembly, advanced materials, and perfect closure lines was still 50 years in the future. The carport was therefore a cheap and effective device for protecting a car. Mr. Jacobs added: \\"Our cheap second- hand car had stood out all winter at the curb, often in weather far below zero (Fahrenheit). A carport was a downright luxury for it.\\"  Modern carports  Modern carports are typically made of metal (steel, tin, or aluminum) and are modular in style in the US, while remaining flat-roofed permanent structures in much of the rest of the world. The carport is considered to be an economical method of protecting cars from the weather and sun damage. The metal carports in USA can be divided into Regular, Boxed-Eave, and Vertical roof styles. They differ in the sturdiness and how the roof panels are oriented. The carport and shadeport industry has modernized quite a lot over time. It is no longer just a roof covering for a car or vehicle but has extended itself to leisure uses such as awnings for a patio at home or a more modern designer shade sail.

Basarab II ruled during a turbulent time in Wallachia, now part of present-day Romania, with his rule falling between that of the father and son rule of Vlad Dracul and Mircea II. His reign was extremely short, as during that period only the strongest could retain their hold on the region for any great length of time. He took over as ruler in August 1442, holding on to it only until the Autumn of 1443, when Vlad Dracul forced him out. During that time, the power of the Ottoman Empire became stronger with each year, making them a constant threat to independent Wallachia. Anyone who ruled Wallachia had not only the Ottomans to deal with, but the internal conflicts of their own people. Politics had to be juggled between maintaining good relations with the Hungarian Kingdom, who were often needed as powerful allies against the invasions of the Ottomans, as well as maintaining at least semi-friendly relations with the Ottomans themselves. In 1442, Hungarian hero John Hunyadi defeated the Ottomans in battle, and placed Basarab II in power, forcing Vlad Dracul and his family to flee. However, the following year Vlad Dracul regained the throne with Ottoman support, based on a new treaty that had the conditions that he make the usual annual tribute, in addition to sending Wallachian boys each year to be trained for service in the Ottoman army. To further show his loyalty, he sent to the Sultan two of his sons, Vlad »öepe»ô and Radu cel Frumos, as hostages. The elder of the two boys would go on to become the inspiration for the novel Dracula, by Bram Stoker. Basarab II was not killed by Vlad Dracul when the latter restored his rule, however he would be buried alive during the second reign of Vlad Tepes.

They were part of the coal forest flora. They sometimes reached heights of , and the trunks were often over in diameter. They thrived during the Carboniferous Period (about 359.2 ¬± 2.5 Mya (million years ago) and were found until the Late Triassic, about 205 Mya) before going extinct. Sometimes erroneously called \\"giant club mosses\\", the genus was actually more closely related to modern quillworts than to modern club mosses.  Etymology  The name Lepidodendron comes from the Greek ŒªŒµœÄŒØœÇ ', scale, and Œ¥Œ≠ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøŒΩ dendron, tree.  Description and biology  Artist's impression of Lepidodendron Lepidodendron species were comparable in size to modern trees. The plants had tapering trunks as wide as at their base that rose to about and even , arising from an underground system of horizontally spreading branches that were covered with many rootlets. Though the height of the trees make the plants similar to modern trees, the constant dichotomy of branches created a habit that contrasts with that of modern trees. At the ends of branches were oval-shaped cones that had a similar shape to modern cones of a spruce or fir. The stem of the trees had a unifacial vascular cambium, contrasting with the bifacial vascular cambium of modern trees. Though the bifacial cambium of modern trees produces both secondary phloem and xylem, the unifacial cambium of Lepidodendron trees produced only secondary xylem. As the trees aged, the wood produced by the unifacial cambium decreased towards the top of the plant such that terminal twigs resembled young Lepidodendron stems. The stems and branches of the trees contained little wood as compared to modern trees, with the majority of mature stems consisting of a massive cortical meristem. The near uniform growth of this cortical tissue indicates no difference in growth during changing seasons, and the absence of dormant buds further indicates the lack of seasonality in Lepidodendron species. The outermost cortex of oldest stems developed into the bark-like lycopodiopsid periderm. The bark of the trees was somewhat similar to that of Picea species, as leaf scars formed peg- like projections that stretched and tore as the bark stretched. To resist the bending force of wind, Lepidodendron trees depended on their outer bark rather than their vascular tissues, as compared to modern trees that rely mostly on their central mass of wood. The leaves of the trees were needle-like and were densely spiraled about young shoots, each possessing only a single vein. The leaves were similar to those of a fir in some species and similar to those of Pinus roxburghii in others, though in general the leaves of Lepidodendron species are indistinguishable from those of Sigillaria species. The decurrent leaves formed a cylindrical shell around branches. The leaves were only present on thin and young branches, indicating that though the trees were evergreen they did not retain their needles for as long as modern conifers. The leaf-cushions were fusiform and elongated, growing at most to a length of and a width of . The middle of leaf-cushions were smooth, where leaf scars were created when an abscission layer cut a leaf from its base. Each leaf scar was composed of a central circular or triangular scar and two lateral scars that were smaller and oval-shaped. This central scar marks where the main vascular bundle of the leaf connected to the vascular system of the stem. This xylem bundle was composed only of primary trachea. The two outer scars mark the forked branches of a strand of vascular tissue that passed from the cortex of the stem into the leaf. This forked strand is sometimes referred to as the \\"parichnos\\". Surrounding this strand were parenchyma cells and occasionally thick-walled elements. Surrounding both conducting tissues was a broad sheath of transfusion tracheids. Below the leaf scar the leaf-cushion tapered to a basal position. In this tapering area circular impressions with fine pits were present. These impressions were continuous with the parichnos scars near the top of the tapering portion. This is because the impressions are formed by aerenchyma tissue that developed in closely with the parichnos. Above the leaf scar was a deep triangular impression known as the \\"ligular pit\\" for its similarities to the ligule of Isoetes. In some leaf-cushions a second depression was present above the ligular pit. Though its purpose is unclear, it has been suggested that the depression may mark the position of a sporangium. As the branch of a Lepidodendron tree grew the leaf-cushion only grew to a certain extent, past which the leaf-cushion stretched. This stretching widened the groove that separated the leaf-cushions, creating a broad, flat channel. Hyphae are occasionally present in the tissues of Lepidodendron trees, indicating a susceptibility to fungal parasites. Different fossil genera have been described to name the various levels of decay in Lepidodendron bark fossils. The name Bergeria describes stems that have lost their epidermises, Aspidiariu is used when cushions have been removed by deep decay, and Knorria is used when the leaf cushions and the majority of cortical tissues has decayed, with a shallow \\"fluted\\" surface remaining. However, it has been suggested that these are more likely growth forms than preserved bark types, as entire fossilized trunks have been discovered with dissimilar forms; if decay is assumed to be constant throughout the trunk, then different forms indicate growth rather than levels of decay. It is likely that the trunk of Lepidodendron trees were subject to the growth forms Knorria, Aspidiaria, and Bergeria progressing up the trunk, respectively. Reproduction Lepidodendron species had a life cycle of 10 to 15 years composed of a growth cycle, in which the trees grew to a predetermined height, and a subsequent reproductive cycle, in which the trees produced reproductive organs, after which the trees died, similar to the life cycle of a Mauna Kea silversword. Rather than reproduce with seeds, Lepidodendron trees reproduced with spores. The spores were stored in sporangia situated on fertile stems that grew on or near the main trunk. The fertile stems grew together in cone-like structures that clustered at the tips of branches. Distribution The lack of growth rings and of dormant buds indicate no seasonal growth patterns and modern plants with similar characteristics tend to grow in tropical conditions, but Lepidodendron species were distributed throughout subtropical conditions. The trees inhabited an extensive area compared to tropical flora of the same time period, with trees growing as far north as Spitsbergen and as far south as South America, in a latitudinal range of 120¬∞.  Decline and extinction  By the Mesozoic era, the giant lycopsids had died out and were replaced by conifers as well as smaller quillworts. This may have been the result of competition from the emerging woody gymnosperms. Lepidodendron is one of the more common plant fossils found in Pennsylvanian-age (Late Carboniferous) rocks. They are closely related to other extinct lycopsid genera, Sigillaria and Lepidendropsis.  In popular culture  In the 19th century, due to the reptilian look of the diamond-shaped leaf scar pattern, petrified trunks of Lepidodendron were frequently exhibited at fairgrounds by amateurs as giant fossil lizards or snakes. Inversely, the fossil of a temnospondyl amphibian collected in a Triassic formation in Tasmania was described in 1885 as the cone of an ancient plant, with affinities to this genus, as Lepidostrobus muelleri.

It is certain, however, that he did not send any troops in aid and as a result, John Hunyadi took back the Transylvanian possessions of FƒÉgƒÉra»ô and Amla»ô on 23 April 1452. Vladislav retaliated by embargoing all Wallachian trade to Brasov county, then part of Hunyadi's Transylvania. However, on 15 November 1455, after Hunyadi informed the people of Brasov that the embargo would be lifted, Vladislav seized back Transylvanian possessions, and attacked the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô fortress and in the process burns a few Saxon villages. In response, Hunyadi gives Vlad III; a son of the rival DrƒÉcule»ôti house of Basarab (the future Vlad the Impaler) military support and, with the help of the Saxons whose villages were burned down, disposed Vladislav II. Death On July 22, 1456, Vlad II Dracul's son Vlad III Dracula led a small army of mercenaries into Wallachia, when they were intercepted by Vladislav and his men near Targsor. The commanders agreed to settle the dispute in single combat, so Vladislav and Dracula engaged in hand-to-hand combat in front of their hosts until Vlad Dracula struck a killing blow to Wallachia's Voivode. Vladislav was not buried at the Snagov Monastery which he founded, instead, he was buried at the Dealu Monastery. His gravestone is marked \\"August 22, 1456\\", however, that was the date of the engraving and not the date of his passing. By August 22 Vlad III had already replaced Vladislav on the throne of Wallachia. Legacy Vladislav founded the Snagov Monastery in 1453 where a wooden sculpted door was preserved to this day and it is exhibited at the Religious Art Museum of Bucharest. At Mount Athos in 1450, Vladislav gave Koutloumousiou Monastery a charter and gave a gift of 10000 Ak√ßet to the St. Elijah Skit.

Acting career An only child, Hamilton was born in Lynn, Massachusetts. His show business career began when he secured a job as a shirt model in magazine ads, similar to fellow silent film performer Reed Howes, who was known in advertisements as \\"The Arrow Collar Man\\".Barry Monush. Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the Silent Era to 1965, p. 308 After this, he became interested in acting and joined several stock companies where he gained experience and training as an actor in professional stage productions. This allowed him to secure his first film role in 1918 in Vitagraph's The Beloved Impostor, however, he obtained his big break from D. W. Griffith in The White Rose (1923). In 1924, he traveled to Germany with Griffith and made a film about the incredibly harsh living conditions in post-World War I Germany, Isn't Life Wonderful. While filming America in 1924, a soldier's arm was blown off. As fellow actor Charles Emmett Mack recalls, \\"Neil Hamilton and I went to neighboring towns and raised a fund for him‚ÄîI doing a song and dance and Neil collecting a coin.\\" Hamilton was signed by Paramount Pictures in the mid-1920s and became one of their leading men. He often appeared opposite star Bebe Daniels. In 1926, he played one of Ronald Colman's brothers in Paramount's original silent version of Beau Geste. In 1926, Hamilton played Nick Carraway in the first production of The Great Gatsby, now a lost film. He starred in John Ford's Mother Machree with Victor McLaglen, and with John Wayne in an early bit role before he was well known, the title of which would coincidentally become sidekick Chief O'Hara's catchphrase in the Batman television show nearly four decades later. He was steadily employed in supporting roles and worked for just about every studio in Hollywood. Hamilton in Stars of the Photoplay, 1924 He made the transition to sound pictures at the end of the 1920s and continued appearing in noteworthy productions. In 1930, he appeared in the original production of The Dawn Patrol (retitled \\"Flight Commander\\" after its remake), playing the squadron commander, a role played by Basil Rathbone in the 1938 remake. Hamilton was billed above newcomer Clark Gable in the 1931 Joan Crawford vehicle Laughing Sinners, in which he plays a cad who deserts Crawford's brokenhearted character. He originated the role of milksop Harry Holt, Jane's fiance, in the 1932 film Tarzan the Ape Man, and he actually received top billing in the film. Hamilton reprised the role in the 1934 pre-Code sequel, Tarzan and His Mate, at Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer. He appeared in 268 films, both silents and talkies, and made five films in England in 1936 and 1937. \\"A\\"-level work in Hollywood dried up for Hamilton by the 1940s, and he was reduced to working in serials, \\"B\\" films, and other low-budget projects. He starred as the villain in King of the Texas Rangers, one of the most successful movie serials of all time for Republic Pictures in 1941. In Since You Went Away, a 1944 epic about life on the home front in World War II, Hamilton is seen only in still photographs as a serviceman away at war. His family's travails during his absence are the center of the movie. Hamilton reportedly shot scenes for the movie before filmmakers decided to keep his character off-screen. He appeared in the 1944 film noir classic When Strangers Marry with Robert Mitchum. In a 1970s book interview for Whatever Happened To ..., Hamilton said he had been banned from A level work for insulting a studio executive. A Roman Catholic, Hamilton said that his faith got him through the difficult period of late 1942 to early 1944, when he could not obtain film employment and was down on his luck financially. When television came along, Hamilton hosted Hollywood Screen Test (1948-1953), co-starred in the short-lived sitcom That Wonderful Guy with Jack Lemmon (1949‚Äì50), at the same time as Hollywood Screen Test, and did guest shots on numerous series of the 1950s and 1960s such as seven episodes of Perry Mason, five episodes of 77 Sunset Strip, as well as Maverick, The Real McCoys, Mister Ed, Bachelor Father, The Outer Limits, and The Cara Williams Show. During the late 1940s and early 1950s Hamilton performed on Broadway in such shows as Many Happy Returns (1945), The Men We Marry (1948), To Be Continued (1952), and Late Love (1953‚Äì54). In 1960, actor Richard Cromwell was seeking a comeback of sorts in 20th Century Fox's planned production of The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come but Cromwell died of complications from liver cancer. Producer Maury Dexter quickly signed Hamilton to replace Cromwell in the film, which co-starred Jimmie Rodgers and Chill Wills. During the 1960s, Hamilton appeared in three Jerry Lewis films: The Patsy, The Family Jewels, and Which Way to the Front?

Twenty-four villeins and fourteen smallholders had land for fifteen ploughs. There were also one and a half square leagues of pasture and a small amount of woodland. The income of the manor was ¬£6 sterling.Thorn, C. et al. (1979) Cornwall. Chichester: Phillimore; entry 1,10Open Domesday Online: Callington, accessed December 2017. In 1601 Robert Rolle (died 1633) purchased the manor of Callington, thereby gaining the pocket borough seat of Callington in Parliament,Hunneyball (2010) which in future served to promote the careers of many Rolles. He nominated to this seat his brother William Rolle (died 1652) in 1604 and 1614, his son Sir Henry Rolle (1589‚Äì1656), of Shapwick, in 1620 and 1624, his son- in-law Thomas Wise (died March 1641) of Sydenham in Devon, in 1625, and another son John Rolle (1598‚Äì1648), In the 19th century, Callington was one of the most important mining areas in Great Britain. Deposits of silver were found nearby in Silver Valley. Today, the area is marked by mining remains, but there are no active mines. Granite is still quarried on Hingston Down. The former Callington constituency, a rotten borough, elected two members to the unreformed House of Commons but was abolished by the Reform Act 1832. The town is now in the South East Cornwall constituency. St Mary's Church was originally a chapel of ease to South Hill; it was consecrated in 1438 and then had two aisles and a buttressed tower; a second north aisle was added in 1882. Unusually for Cornwall there is a clerestory; the wagon roofs are old. The parish church contains the fine brass of Nicholas Assheton and his wife, 1466.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed. Penguin Books; pp. 48-49Dunkin, E. (1882) Monumental Brasses. London, Spottiswoode; pp. 16-18, pl. XV In the churchyard there is a Gothic lantern cross. It was first mentioned by the historian William Borlase in 1752. Each of the four faces of the cross head features a carved figure beneath an ogee arch. The heads of these figures have been chiselled off, no doubt in the Commonwealth period.Langdon, A. G. (2005) Stone Crosses in East Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 26 Governance Callington is one of a small number of towns to continue to appoint a Portreeve; originally a medieval revenue officer and now an honorary title given to the chairman of the town council. Callington Town Council has twelve members and covers the civil parish of Callington. At the Council elections in 2013 only ten candidates stood, eight Independents and two Mebyon Kernow Councillors. The current portreeve of the town is Suzan Tolman. Development In recent years, the town has seen much residential development with more, including social housing, planned for the next few years. The neighbouring village of Kelly Bray has almost doubled in size in recent years with houses still being built in the area. A housing estate named Meadowbrook is in the process of being built. Twinning Callington is twinned with Guipavas in Brittany, France, and Barsb√ºttel near Hamburg in Germany. It also has unofficial friendship links with Keila in Estonia and a suburb of M√°laga, Spain. Sport Callington has both football and cricket teams. Callington Town Football Club (established 1989) has four adult teams playing in the South West Peninsula League, East Cornwall League, Duchy League and South West Regional Women's Football League. They all play at Marshfield Parc, which backs onto Callington Community College. Callington Cricket Club has three teams playing in the Cornwall Cricket League and play their games at Moores Park. Callington Badminton Club plays on a Friday from 1900hrs till 2200hrs at the Community College sports hall. They play in the Plymouth & District league and run two men's teams, a Ladies team and a mixed/medley team. The club is open to all ages and abilities so everyone is welcome.

The 15th century was a very volatile time in Wallachia, with the throne passing first from one then to another of the many Princes and family members of both Branches of the House of Basarab that desired it, and soon enough (i.e. July 1481) Basarab IV was again Voivode of Wallachia, with Ottoman support. ≈ûtefan made a last attempt to secure his influence in Wallachia the next summer. and within the year Basarab lost the throne again. Although Vlad IV was restored, he was soon forced to accept the Sultan's suzerainty.  Death  Basarab IV was killed during the clashes around Mar-Jul of 1482, perhaps due to a conspiracy led by the boyars of Wallachia. Others however suggest he died in battle by ≈ûtefan III during ≈ûtefan III's invasion that year. Later on Neagoe Craiovescu who had acceded to the throne of Wallachia under the name Neagoe Basarab had claimed that Basarab IV was his father by having had an affair with his mom Neaga, then married with grand boyar P√¢rvu Craiovescu.

The AMF brand continues in use by the following companies: * In the United States and Mexico, for the AMF Bowling centers owned or operated by Bowlero Corporation. * In the United Kingdom, for the AMF bowling centres owned by Hollywood Bowl Group. * Worldwide, for bowling equipment manufactured and marketed by QubicaAMF Worldwide. The bowling centers are ten- pin bowling centers where bowling may be purchased per game, per hour, or as part of a birthday party or corporate event package. Many locations support bowling leagues. Because many of the AMF-branded bowling centers were acquired from other parties, some centers use by bowling equipment manufactured or distributed by other companies such as Brunswick Bowling & Billiards instead of AMF-branded equipment. History The American Machine and Foundry (known after 1970 as AMF, Inc.) moved into the bowling business after World War II, when AMF automated bowling equipment and bowling centers became profitable business ventures, and in subsequent years into many other manufacturing businesses. Aging production facilities and increasing quality control problems in some product lines caused sales declines in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The company's vast diversified output proved difficult to efficiently manage, and the company began to experience losses. Bowling remained quite profitable, however, so the company began a campaign of expansion in this area, spending nearly $100 million on acquisitions of bowling centers in 1984 and 1985. In 1985, corporate raider Irwin L. Jacobs's Minstar, Inc. bought AMF Inc. and began to sell its various business divisions. Commonwealth Venture Partners, a group of private investors in Richmond, Virginia, paid $225 million in 1985 to purchase the bowling center and bowling products divisions, forming AMF Bowling Companies, Inc. (later known as AMF Bowling Worldwide). In 1996 Goldman Sachs paid $1.4 billion to buy the company from Commonwealth Ventures. AMF Bowling went public with its listing on the New York Stock Exchange in November 1997. In 1998 its stock price plummeted as losses mounted, so expansion plans were put on hold. In 1999 the decision was made to downsize. By 2000 the company was more than $1 billion in debt and was delisted. AMF Bowling entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the first time in April 2001, stating that it had ‚Äúoverextended itself by acquiring 260 additional bowling centers that it had struggled to manage,‚Äù and that the demand for bowling products had decreased. Private equity firm Code Hennessy & Simmons bought the company in 2004 for $670 million to bring it out of bankruptcy. The transaction was financed in part by a $254 million sale and lease-back of 186 bowling centers to iStar Financial. Shortly after, the company began shedding its ‚Äúnon-core, foreign assets‚Äù to focus on improving the operations of its remaining centers. Fred Hipp, the former California Pizza Kitchen top executive who became President and CEO in 2004, said the strategy would now be to ‚Äúbring as much focus as possible to the management of our core U.S. center and bowling products businesses.\\" In 2005, AMF Bowling's products division and Italian-based Qubica Worldwide formed a 50/50 joint venture, QubicaAMF Worldwide. AMF Bowling went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in November 2012. In its filing the company cited the challenge of adjusting to ‚Äúthe marked shift in the average bowling customer‚Äù. In 2013, AMF Bowling was brought out of bankruptcy through its merger with Strike Holdings LLC (doing business as the bowling center operator Bowlmor Lanes), bringing all remaining bowling centers and the 50% interest in the QubicaAMF joint venture under the control of Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation). Bowlmor AMF sold its QubicaAMF joint venture interest to Qubica in 2014. Bowling centers A typical US AMF-branded bowling center that uses AMF pinsetters At the formation of AMF Bowling in 1986, Commonwealth Ventures acquired the 110 AMF-owned bowling centers in the United States and abroad, as well as the 22 centers owned by one of the partners in Commonwealth Ventures, Major League Bowling Corp. Commonwealth then spent nearly $500 million revitalizing the bowling center business with a focus on expanding the appeal of bowling to league and casual bowlers. In 1991 the company hired former PepsiCo executive Mark Willoughby to head the bowling center business. Willoughby set out to make AMF Bowling the ‚ÄúMcDonald's of bowling‚Äù. The company became the largest owner of bowling centers in the US in 1995 with the acquisition of Fair Lanes, Inc., which the year before had been through a leveraged buyout, filed for bankruptcy, and then emerged from it as it struggled to get the cash needed to renovate its centers. The addition of Fair Lanes's 106 bowling centers brought AMF Bowling‚Äôs total to 205 centers in the US and 79 overseas. When Goldman Sachs acquired the company in 1996, its strategy was to clean up purchased properties and create a national chain of amusement complexes. That year, the company bought Bowling Corporation of America from closely held Charan Industries, adding 50 more bowling centers. In that same year it purchased 43 centers from American Recreation Centers. In 1997, the company acquired 15 centers from Conbow Corporation. By the start of 1999, AMF Bowling operated 421 centers in the United States, 46 in Australia, 37 in the United Kingdom, and 41 in eight other countries. After emerging from bankruptcy in 2005, the company sold its centers in Australia and the United Kingdom in 2004 and 2005. When it entered bankruptcy for the second time in 2012, the company observed, ‚ÄúIn the 1960s and 70s‚Ä¶ the typical bowler was a blue collar factory worker who belonged to one or more bowling leagues. Today‚Äôs typical bowler comes from a broader swath of the middle-class, and is unlikely to bowl in a league. Non-league bowlers bowl less often. And when they do bowl, they expect nicer amenities ‚Äì automatic scoring, a variety of food and beverage options, and more attractive facilities.‚Äù As evidence of the shift, the company noted that, ‚Äúaccording to the United States Bowling Congress, in 1998 the nation‚Äôs three largest league bowling organizations had over 4.1 million members. Just a decade later, membership had declined by 36% to 2.6 million.‚Äù To respond to the change in the average bowling customer, AMF constructed nine upscale 300 Centers with ‚Äúhigh-end bars and lounges designed with a modern d√©cor‚Äù that drew ‚Äúsignificant business through group events.‚Äù However, the Great Recession of 2008 eroded AMF's ability to maintain and enhance its 262 existing US bowling centers and meant that people were bowling less often. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, AMF owned 27 bowling centers, leased 186 bowling centers through agreements with iStar Financial, and leased 57 under agreements with various other parties. The 2013 merger brought the remaining US and Mexico centers under the control of a new entity, Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation), making it the world's largest owner and operator of bowling centers in the United States. In the three years prior to the reorganization, AMF Bowling had closed nine owned US centers and 33 leased US centers due to \\"declining operating performance, unattractive options to renew leases, or an attractive sales opportunity.\\" That left 257 AMF bowling centers in the United States and eight in Mexico passing to Bowlmor AMF at the time of the reorganization. Bowling equipment The American Machine and Foundry Pinspotter, developed in 1951 and first marketed in 1952, was one of the first fully automated pinsetters used in quantity in the bowling industry. When Commonwealth Ventures acquired the bowling center and bowling equipment divisions of AMF, Inc. to form AMF Bowling in 1985, its new company was already a major manufacturer of pinsetters, bowling pins, bowling balls, ball returns, lane surfaces, automatic scoring equipment, and other bowling equipment. In 2005, AMF Bowling's equipment division and Italian-based Qubica Worldwide formed a 50/50 joint venture, QubicaAMF Worldwide. The partnership combined Qubica's expertise in automatic scoring technology and AMF Bowling's technology in lane equipment and pinsetters. In 2007, a new company, 900 Global, purchased the rights to sell bowling balls with the AMF logo. In February 2014, the principals of bowling ball manufacturer Storm Products, Inc. made a significant investment in 900 Global. With AMF Bowling's exit from bankruptcy in 2013, the 50% interest in the QubicaAMF joint venture was brought under the control of Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation). In December 2014, the Qubica original founders acquired the 50% interest held by Bowlmor AMF (Bowlero), bringing the manufacturing and marketing of AMF-branded bowling equipment under the full control of QubicaAMF Worldwide.

History  Forms have existed for a significant amount of time, with historians of law having discovered preprinted legal forms from the early 19th century that greatly simplified the task of drafting complaints and various other legal pleadings.  Advantages  Advantages of forms include the following: * One has to write less (while the printing is almost universally done in some automatic way) * One is told or reminded what information has to be supplied * There is uniformity, for convenience in processing * Information is collected in writing and so can be reexamined later (the form can also include a signature field to allow someone to take responsibility for the accuracy of the information provided). * Simpler tasks, such as collecting or distributing data, can be separated in the workflow from more skilled processes, such as making decisions. Issuing and processing the forms may then be done by less skilled staff, or by a computer. The de-skilled task becomes issuing or completing the appropriate form for the circumstances, and then passing it on to the next step in the workflow.

Cornish Language Partnership. at 334 metres high, dominates the area between Callington and the River Tamar in southeast Cornwall, England, UK. The word 'Kit' comes from Old English for kite, a reference to birds of prey (and not specifically the red kite). Buzzards and sparrowhawks can still be seen on the hill. It is one of five Marilyn hills in Cornwall, the four others are Watch Croft, Brown Willy, Carnmenellis and Hensbarrow Beacon. Geography Kit Hill Country Park (which includes the hill and surrounding areas), was given to the people of Cornwall in 1985 to mark the birth of Prince William, by his father, the Duke of Cornwall (Prince Charles). It is managed by Cornwall Council,Exploring Cornish Mines - Vol. 4. and consists of some 400 acres (152 hectares), making it the most dominant landscape feature in East Cornwall. Kit Hill is the highest point in the Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The hill was formed in the same way as nearby Bodmin Moor by the intrusion of magma into overlying sedimentary rocks. This caused the formation of many mineral deposits that were mined extensively in the 18th and early 19th centuries. As the highest point of Hingston Down, Kit Hill is probably the best viewpoint in the southeast of Cornwall, with views of the Tamar valley, Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor. Kit Hill Country Park has a high wildlife population including deer and badgers, rabbits, rare moths and butterflies. On the summit of Kit Hill is an artificial fort (a Civil War redoubt) and a folly built by Sir John Call of Whiteford, Stoke Climsland, built in the style of a low-walled Saxon castle. History The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that in 835 (corrected by scholars to 838 AD) Egbert king of the West Saxons defeated an army of Vikings and Cornish at Hengestdun = \\"Stallion Hill\\", which is usually interpreted as being at Hingston Down.See, for example: Other notable artifacts on Kit Hill include Neolithic and Bronze Age barrows. The area around these is maintained by a ranger and volunteers, who also generally keep the vegetation on the hill under control. Mining The Country Park is steeped in mining history. Metals extracted included tin, silver, copper and tungsten. The main mines were: * Kit Hill Summit Mines (which included a windmill near the present stack). These mines and shafts started about 1826: Kit Hill United closed in 1864. * East Kit Hill Mine was worked from 1855 to 1909. * Hingston Down mine (which worked westwards towards Kit Hill). This was a very early mine, and evidence shows it may have started in the 17th century: it closed in 1885. * South Kit Hill Mine was worked from 1856 to 1884. Atomic Energy Authority In 1877 a company called Kit Hill Tunnel Ltd began work on both the south and north sides of the hill to create a tunnel which would be long. The southern portal was at Silver Hill, and that at the north was near a small mine called Excelsior. However, due to the toughness of the underlying bedrock, progress was costly and slow, and ceased about a year later. In 1881 a new company named Kit Hill Great Consols took over the setts of Kit Hill United and Excelsior mine. They deepened the North Engine Shaft to 112 fathoms and lengthened the tunnel running south to meet it. However, this too was proving too costly, and wound up in 1885, before it was half-way complete. Several later attempts were made to extend the Excelsior Tunnel, but by 1938, it was still only long. However, in 1959 the Atomic Energy Authority took over operations, and used the tunnel for underground explosions.Barton, Denys Bradford (1964) The Mines & Mineral Railways of East Cornwall & West Devon. Truro: D. Bradford Barton Ltd.

The charge sizes were chosen so that if the decoupling worked as predicted, the seismic signals would be similar in intensity. Railways Construction of The Tamar, Kit Hill & Callington Railway started in 1864. The name was later changed to the East Cornwall Mineral Railway, and the line opened in 1872. Seven and a half miles long, it ran from Calstock's river frontage, past Kelly Quay & Drakewalls and the Gunnislake quarries, along the northern flank of Hingston Down to below Kit Hill at Kelly Bray, where an inclined tramway connected with it. It amalgamated with the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway crossing the Tamar above Calstock and onto the junction at Bere Alston. The Gunnislake to Bere Alston section still survives as part of the Tamar Valley Line. Some remnants, mainly the granite blocks, of the line can be found on the northern slopes of the Country Park site.

This collection of linked short stories is a prequel: it was written immediately after the success of The Prisoner of Zenda and was published in 1896, but is set in the 1730s, well over a century before the events of Zenda and its sequel, Rupert of Hentzau. The stories deal with the love life of Princess Osra, younger sister of Rudolf III, the shared ancestor of Rudolf Rassendyll, the English gentleman who acts as political decoy in The Prisoner of Zenda, and Rudolph V of the House of Elphberg, the absolute monarch of that Germanic kingdom. Literary scholar Shoshana Milgram Knapp has observed that Hope's stories in the volume are both analytic of and acclamatory toward the inspiration of romantic love: > \\"Osra‚Äôs physical beauty is a metaphor for spiritual beauty. Her name, the > feminine form of \\"Osric,\\" is not an invention, but it is sufficiently > unusual to suggest that the character is herself extraordinary, separated > from life‚Äôs routine.

The third law is also more generally stated as: \\"To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.\\"This translation of the third law and the commentary following it can be found in the \\"Principia\\" on page 20 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation. The attribution of which of the two forces is the action and which is the reaction is arbitrary. Either of the two can be considered the action, while the other is its associated reaction. Examples Interaction with ground When something is exerting force on the ground, the ground will push back with equal force in the opposite direction. In certain fields of applied physics, such as biomechanics, this force by the ground is called 'ground reaction force'; the force by the object on the ground is viewed as the 'action'. When someone wants to jump, he or she exerts additional downward force on the ground ('action'). Simultaneously, the ground exerts upward force on the person ('reaction'). If this upward force is greater than the person's weight, this will result in upward acceleration. When these forces are perpendicular to the ground, they are also called a normal force. Likewise, the spinning wheels of a vehicle attempt to slide backward across the ground. If the ground is not too slippery, this results in a pair of friction forces: the 'action' by the wheel on the ground in backward direction, and the 'reaction' by the ground on the wheel in forward direction. This forward force propels the vehicle. Gravitational forces Two bodies similar to the Sun and Earth, i.e. with an extreme difference in mass ‚Äì the red X marks the barycenter The Earth, among other planets, orbits the Sun because the Sun exerts a gravitational pull that acts as a centripetal force, holding the Earth to it, which would otherwise go shooting off into space. If the Sun's pull is considered an action, then Earth simultaneously exerts a reaction as a gravitational pull on the Sun. Earth's pull has the same amplitude as the Sun but in the opposite direction. Since the Sun's mass is so much larger than Earth's, the Sun does not generally appear to react to the pull of Earth, but in fact it does, as demonstrated in the animation (not to precise scale). A correct way of describing the combined motion of both objects (ignoring all other celestial bodies for the moment) is to say that they both orbit around the center of mass, referred to in astronomy as the barycenter, of the combined system. Supported mass Any mass on earth is pulled down by the gravitational force of the earth; this force is also called its weight. The corresponding 'reaction' is the gravitational force that mass exerts on the planet. If the object is supported so that it remains at rest, for instance by a cable from which it is hanging, or by a surface underneath, or by a liquid on which it is floating, there is also a support force in upward direction (tension force, normal force, buoyant force, respectively). This support force is an 'equal and opposite' force; we know this not because of Newton's third law, but because the object remains at rest, so that the forces must be balanced. To this support force there is also a 'reaction': the object pulls down on the supporting cable, or pushes down on the supporting surface or liquid. In this case, there are therefore four forces of equal magnitude: * F1. gravitational force by earth on object (downward) * F2. gravitational force by object on earth (upward) * F3. force by support on object (upward) * F4. force by object on support (downward) Forces F1 and F2 are equal due of Newton's third law; the same is true for forces F3 and F4. Forces F1 and F3 are equal if and only if the object is in equilibrium, and no other forces are applied. (This has nothing to do with Newton's third law.) Mass on a spring If a mass is hanging from a spring, the same considerations apply as before. However, if this system is then perturbed (e.g., the mass is given a slight kick upwards or downwards, say), the mass starts to oscillate up and down. Because of these accelerations (and subsequent decelerations), we conclude from Newton's second law that a net force is responsible for the observed change in velocity. The gravitational force pulling down on the mass is no longer equal to the upward elastic force of the spring. In the terminology of the previous section, F1 and F3 are no longer equal. However, it is still true that F1 = F2 and F3 = F4, as this is required by Newton's third law. Causal misinterpretation The terms 'action' and 'reaction' have the misleading suggestion of causality, as if the 'action' is the cause and 'reaction' is the effect. It is therefore easy to think of the second force as being there because of the first, and even happening some time after the first. This is incorrect; the forces are perfectly simultaneous, and are there for the same reason. When the forces are caused by a person's volition (e.g. a soccer player kicks a ball), this volitional cause often leads to an asymmetric interpretation, where the force by the player on the ball is considered the 'action' and the force by the ball on the player, the 'reaction'. But physically, the situation is symmetric. The forces on ball and player are both explained by their nearness, which results in a pair of contact forces (ultimately due to electric repulsion). That this nearness is caused by a decision of the player has no bearing on the physical analysis. As far as the physics is concerned, the labels 'action' and 'reaction' can be flipped. 'Equal and opposite' One problem frequently observed by physics educators is that students tend to apply Newton's third law to pairs of 'equal and opposite' forces acting on the same object. This is incorrect; the third law refers to forces on two different objects. For example, a book lying on a table is subject to a downward gravitational force (exerted by the earth) and to an upward normal force by the table. Since the book is not accelerating, these forces must be exactly balanced, according to Newton's First or Second law. They are therefore 'equal and opposite'. However, these forces are not always equally strong; they will be different if the book is pushed down by a third force, or if the table is slanted, or if the table-and-book system is in an accelerating elevator. The case of three or more forces is covered by considering the sum of all forces. A possible cause of this problem is that the third law is often stated in an abbreviated form: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, without the details, namely that these forces act on two different objects. Moreover, there is a causal connection between the weight of something and the normal force: if an object had no weight, it would not experience support force from the table, and the weight dictates how strong the support force will be. This causal relationship is not due to the third law but to other physical relations in the system. Centripetal and centrifugal force Another common mistake is to state that \\"the centrifugal force that an object experiences is the reaction to the centripetal force on that object.\\" If an object were simultaneously subject to both a centripetal force and an equal and opposite centrifugal force, the resultant force would vanish and the object could not experience a circular motion. The centrifugal force is sometimes called a fictitious force or pseudo force, to underscore the fact that such a force only appears when calculations or measurements are conducted in non-inertial reference frames.

Both models were sold for a short time before the R was discontinued for model/fiscal year 1908. The S roadster, like the R, had fenders attached to running boards, and a mechanical oiler. Differences from the R included Model N-style 28-inch tires and the pointed trunk. The Model S Roadster was based on the same chassis as models N, R, and S runabout before it. Making its appearance during Ford fiscal/model year 1908, the S Roadster had an enclosed cowl, full fenders and fender aprons, and a third \\"rumble\\" seat.

Abd el-Krim defeated the Spanish many times and drove them back to a few coastal outposts. He wanted to create a stable state for the Berbers to shield them from the long years of fighting. Abd el-Krim sent diplomatic representatives to London and Paris to try to establish diplomatic relations with Europe. In late 1925, the French and Spanish created a joint task force of half a million men supported by tanks and aircraft.

His father Vlad Dracul had previously held the throne, as had his brothers Mircea II and Radu the Handsome, and lastly Vlad III Dracula. The 15th century was a very volatile time in Wallachia, with the throne passing first from one then to another of the many princes that desired it. Both of his younger brothers, Vlad III and Radu, had been hostages for a number of years to the Ottoman Sultan, having been offered up to the Ottoman court by their own father, Vlad Dracul, in exchange for the Ottoman's support of Vlad Dracul regaining his throne. His father had first gained the throne following the death of Vlad the Monk's uncle. Both his brothers Mircea II and Vlad III were able military commanders in the field, and both saw success in battle against the Ottomans. In 1447, his brother Mircea II and his father were both captured and brutally killed. Following this, Vlad III was placed on the throne by the Ottomans, but was forced off shortly thereafter by forces supported by John Hunyadi. This would begin a long quest by Vlad III to gain the throne, which he would do two more times. His longest time on the throne would be from 1456 to 1462, this being his reign of terror for which he would become best known, and which would lead to him being the inspiration for the novel Dracula, by Bram Stoker. His brother Radu gained the throne due to the fact that he was the second in the line of succession, losing it several times to Basarab LaiotƒÉ cel BƒÉtr√¢n. Radu died in January 1475, as the result of a long bout with syphilis,Florescu, Radu R. & McNally, Raymond T. (1989). Dracula, prince of many faces: his life and his times.

Vlad III was killed in battle during December 1476, after which Basarab LaiotƒÉ cel BƒÉtr√¢n was restored to the throne, only to be pushed off by Basarab »öepelu»ô cel T√¢nƒÉr in November 1477. Vlad the Monk was a contender to his brother's throne as ruler of the principality of Wallachia for many years, but he took no active part in fighting for the throne until near the end of Vlad III's lifetime. In 1481, the same year Mehmed II died, conflict between his two surviving sons, Bayezid II and Cem, erupted into open conflict. Vlad was now placed on the throne by »òtefan III of Moldavia, who had invaded Wallachia that June and routed Basarab IV at R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea. Soon enough Basarab IV was again Voivode of Wallachia, with Ottoman support. »òtefan made a last attempt to secure his influence in Wallachia, and within the year Basarab lost the throne again, after which he would reign until 1495. Although Vlad IV was restored, he was soon forced to accept the Sultan's suzerainty. In 1495, he helped build St. Nicholas Church, in Bra»ôov, Transylvania. There is nothing historically that suggests his death that same year was anything other than natural. His fairly long reign by comparison to those before him was due in part to his having the support of »òtefan III of Moldavia. He was succeeded by his son, Radu cel Mare, who would reign until 1508, when he was ousted by his first cousin Mihnea cel RƒÉu, son of Vlad the Impaler.

Gene Kelly had a special affection for her and included her in each of his films following her role in An American in Paris. Early life Blake was born in Kinsley in Edwards County, south-central Kansas, to Albert Cummings and the former Alice Stone. Her father was a Methodist circuit rider who discouraged her from becoming an actress, thus she did not enter acting until later in life, despite her family's relocation from Kansas to Southern California. During World War II, Blake and her husband James Lincoln Blake worked in Utah on construction of the detonator for the atomic bomb and performed such jobs as testing equipment destined for the Manhattan Project. The couple received a citation for their work from the U.S. government.Office of Scientific Research and Development website; accessed May 6, 2014. Blake was a first cousin of actor Milburn Stone (her mother and his father were brother and sister), who played the role of Doc Adams on Gunsmoke Western series. She did not begin to study acting until she was 50 years old, when she enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse and took advantage of whatever influence or contacts Milburn Stone had to land acting roles. In the middle 1950s, Blake appeared on Rod Cameron's City Detective and in Ray Milland's sitcom Meet Mr. McNutley, renamed in the second season as The Ray Milland Show. Blake appeared in four episodes of the NBC sitcom It's a Great Life (1954‚Äì1956) and twice on CBS's December Bride, with Spring Byington. Acting career Blake portrayed gushy gossip columnist Dora Bailey in Singin' in the Rain (1952) and was a model for one of the fairies in Walt Disney's animated version of Sleeping Beauty (1959). She appeared as Mrs. Porter, a babysitter, in the 1959 pilot of CBS's Dennis the Menace. About this time, she was cast in a guest-starring role in the sitcoms Guestward, Ho!, with Joanne Dru on ABC, and Angel, with Annie Farg√© on CBS. In 1961, she guest-starred in the episode \\"A View of Murder\\" of the syndicated crime drama The Brothers Brannagan. Blake's Flora MacMichael was a romantic foil to Walter Brennan's Grandpa Amos McCoy on The Real McCoys, a sitcom about a mountain family that relocated to Southern California. Before her role on Batman, she had a recurring role on The Jack Benny Program as the president of the Jack Benny Fan Club - Pasadena Chapter. She played Millie Brinkerhoff in the episode \\"Instant Wedding\\" in the 1963 NBC military drama The Lieutenant starring Gary Lockwood in the title role, and Larry Mondello's mother on Leave It to Beaver. Blake appeared in the pilot episode of The Addams Family (broadcast in the U.S in September 1964) as Miss Comstock, an official from the Addams' children's school. Blake also appeared in a memorable episode of I Love Lucy in 1957 with George Reeves guest- starring as Superman and in an earlier episode in 1954 as store clerk Mrs. Mulford. She played the mother of Joey Barnes on The Joey Bishop Show from 1961 to 1964. At one point, the producers of Batman wanted to fire Blake for unknown reasons. Adam West, with whom she had become friends, stood up for her and she kept her job. The next day, he found a freshly baked cake in his dressing room. Declining health and death Declining health caused Blake's role as Aunt Harriet to be reduced, and with the introduction of Batgirl in the third and final season of Batman, she appeared in only two episodes that season in a guest role. Shortly before her death, she appeared as Mrs. Hardy in the episode \\"The Con Man\\" of the CBS sitcom The Doris Day Show. Blake was admitted to Huntington Memorial Hospital where she died at age 69, the result of a heart attack. She was interred beside her mother in the family plot at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery.* Filmography *Two Sisters from Boston (1946) as Opera Chorus Member (uncredited) *Adam's Rib (1949) as Mrs. Bonner, Adam's Mother (uncredited) *A Life of Her Own (1950) as Regent Studios' Wardrobe Woman (uncredited) *Between Midnight and Dawn (1950) as Mrs. Mallory *M (1951) as Police Station Witness (uncredited) *The Prowler (1951) as Martha Gilvray *No Questions Asked (1951) as Mrs. Brent, Ellen's Landlady (uncredited) *Queen for a Day (1951) as Mrs. Kimpel, High Diver segment *An American in Paris (1951) as Edna Mae Bestram (uncredited) *Rhubarb (1951) as Mrs. Emily Thompson (uncredited) *Little Egypt (1951) *A Millionaire for Christy (1951) as Mrs. Rapello (scenes deleted) *Finders Keepers (1952) *Singin' in the Rain (1952) as Dora Bailey (uncredited) *Skirts Ahoy!

The drums are single headed (cow skin), with an elongated goblet or roughly conical shape, usually placed on a single stand, and most commonly played in sets of three to four. Until the last few decades the Bougarabou was played only one at a time, usually with one hand and a stick, but in the last generation or two (since the 1940s), possibly influenced from congueros in the western hemisphere, players play multiple drum setups. The drum is originally from the Jola (J√≥ola) people in the south of Senegal, the Casamance and the Gambia, the J√≥ola Buluf, the J√≥ola Fogny and the J√≥ola Kalunai. The Jola call a single drum B√∫garabu (the a is pronounced like in _a_ bout) or B√∫garab. As -ab or -abu represents the article, also B√∫gaar, the indefinite denotation, is used synonymously in everyday life whereas the Plural W√∫garaw is nearly not used. The drumset is played by a single drummer, unlike many African tribal situations. The drummer also wears a series of metal bracelets called Siwangas in Buluf and Fogny dialect that contribute to the sound. The audience and the dancers form a circle and clap, often with wooden chunks (size 25‚Äì30 cm) of palm peduncles, and sing with the music, but it is unique in that a single drummer traditionally provides the drumming. There are also some groups using a set of three or four drums and some more drums like djembe or other small Jola drums. They are normally played with only the hands in a standing position. They have a full, deep, rich sound which can be heard for miles and is effective at all dynamic levels. They produce a kind of bass melody in the total rhythm. In other modern drumming situations, they are often used to back up djembes and tammas in a percussion group.

As a wing of the Italian Blackshirts (MVSN), the militia initially consisted of Italian colonists in Albania but later Albanian volunteers were also enlisted. It was headquartered in Tirana. History The Albanian Fascist Militia (MFSH) was formed by Decree no. 91, dated 18.9.1939 of the deputy general and was part of the National Security Volunteer Militia headed by Commander General Mussolini. The militia was tasked with maintaining internal order at the request of the prime minister. Its recruitment was voluntary for all persons who met the requirements for membership within the Fascist Party. The officers were appointed by the General Command of the Voluntary National Security Militia, following the proposal of the Commander of the Albanian Fascist Militia (MFSH), after the Secretary of the Fascist Party was consulted.

In Homer, Deiphobos advances \\"·ΩëœÄŒ±œÉœÄŒØŒ¥ŒπŒ±\\" or under cover of his shield.Iliad. Book 13, line 158 By the time of Herodotus (426 BC), the word had come to mean a high status soldier as is strongly suggested by Herodotus in one of the earliest known uses: \\"Now the horse which Artybius rode was trained to fight with infantrymen by rearing up. Hearing this, Onesilus said to his hypaspist, a Carian of great renown in war and a valiant man...\\"Herodotus, Histories, 5.111 A similar usage occurs in Euripides's play \\"Rhesus\\"Euripides. Rhesus, line 2 and another in his \\"Phoenissae\\". Xenophon was deserted by his horse in a particularly sticky situation.Xenophon, Anabasis. 4.2.20 A hypaspist would differ from a skeuophoros in most cases because the \\"shield bearer\\" is a free warrior and the \\"baggage carrier\\" was probably usually a slave. The word may have had Homeric and heroic connotations that led Philip II of Macedon to use it for an elite military unit. This unit, known as the Hypaspistai, or hypaspists, was probably armed like hoplitesMacedonian Warrior Alexander's elite infantryman, page 41, ,2006 rather than as phalangites (pikemen) in Philip's Macedonian army. In battle, they were probably armed with the Greek aspis shield, spolas or linothorax body-armor, Hoplite's helmet, greaves, dory spear and a xiphos or kopis sword (though their equipment was likely more ornate than main-line soldiers). In set piece battles, the Macedonian Hypaspists were positioned on the flanks of the phalangite's phalanx; in turn, their own flanks were protected by light infantry and cavalry. Their job was to guard the flanks of the large and unwieldy pike phalanx. The armored Phalangites with their 18‚Äì22 ft. sarissas were not particularly agile or able to turn quickly, so hypaspists would prevent attacks on the vulnerable sides of the formation. Their role was vital to the success of Philip's tactics because the Macedonian Phalanx was all but invulnerable from the front, and was, with five layers of iron spikes moving in unison, used as the anvil in a hammer and anvil tactic, where the Companion cavalry was the hammer that smashed the enemy against an anvil of thousands of iron spikes. As such an important yet vulnerable part of the Macedonian Army, it needed protection for its main vulnerability, the flanks. The protection/remedy for this vulnerability was the Hypaspists, who were able to conduct maneuvers and use tactics, which, owing to their hoplite panoply of weapons and armor, would have been impossible (or at least much less effective) if performed by the Phalangites. It is worth noting that all the references to a unit called \\"Hypaspists\\" are much later than the period of Philip, and modern historians have to assume that later sources, like Diodorus SiculusDiodorus Siculus. Book 19.40 (1st century BC) and Arrian,Arrian's Anabasis. Book 2, line 4 and following had access to earlier records. Arrian's phrase tous kouphotatous te kai ama euoplotatous The Campaigns of Alexander. Book IV, 28, viii) has frequently been rendered as 'lightest armed', although Brunt The Campaigns of Alexander. Appendix XIX, paragraph 9 concedes it is more properly translated as 'nimblest' or 'most agile'. There has been a great deal of speculation by military historians ever since the late Hellenistic period about the elite units of Philip's army. The hypaspists may have been raised from the whole kingdom rather than on a cantonal basis; if so, they were the King's Army rather than the army of the kingdom. In the Hellenistic period, hypaspists apparently continued to exist, albeit in different capacities and under different names. The name lived on in the Seleucid, Ptolemaic and Antigonid kingdoms, yet they were now seen as royal bodyguards and military administrators. Polybius mentions a hypaspist being sent by Philip V of Macedon, after his defeat at the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197 BC, to Larissa to burn state papers.Polybius. XVIII.33.1-7 The actual fighting unit of hypaspists seems to have lived on in Macedonia as the corps of 'Peltasts', whose status, equipment and role seems to have been almost exactly the same as that of the hypaspist under Philip.Polybius. V.26.8 Originally consisting of 3,000 men, by the Third Macedonian War there were 5,000, most likely to accommodate their elite formation, the Agema.Polybius.

Thomas attended Kingston Technical School and he then took a course in journalism at South-West Essex Technical College in Walthamstow. Leslie Thomas Daily Telegraph Obituary Retrieved 7 May 2014 In 1949 he was called up for National Service and embarked on a two-year tour of duty in Singapore with the Royal Army Pay Corps. While there he was briefly involved with the military action against communist rebels in the Malayan emergency. He also began to write short articles for publication in English newspapers. Career Upon his return to England in 1951, Thomas resumed his work for the local newspaper group in north London where he had worked before his National Service, but within five years he was working for the Exchange Telegraph news agency, now Extel, and eventually with the London Evening News newspaper, first as a sub- editor, later as a reporter. He stayed with the Evening News until 1965, when he embarked full-time on his writing career. In 1984, Thomas published In My Wildest Dreams recounting his childhood in South Wales, his days in Doctor Barnardo's homes in London, his National Service in the Far East, and his career in journalism. His novels about 1950s British National Service such as The Virgin Soldiers spawned two film versions, in 1969 and 1977, while his Tropic of Ruislip and Dangerous Davies, The Last Detective have been adapted for television (the former as Tropic in 1979 and the latter having also spawned a film version, in 1981 and a TV series in 2003 with Peter Davison). He was a subject of the television programme This Is Your Life in 1979 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. His experiences as a British Army conscript in the Far East during the height of the Malayan emergency were recalled when he appeared in the BBC Radio 2 documentary Caught In The Draft in 1985. He joined ex-RAF national serviceman Bob Monkhouse and BBC Radio 2 drivetime presenter John Dunn in a programme filled with reminiscences about their years in uniform. He was also featured in the short-lived BBC One show Time of My Life in 1983. The show was presented by Noel Edmonds and Thomas was reunited with National Service colleague Reg Wilcock for the first time in 32 years. They duetted on \\"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\\", a song they used to sing frequently at the Liberty Club in Singapore. Thomas was the subject of the first edition of BBC Wales' series Great Welsh Writers, broadcast on BBC One Wales on 25 February 2013.

With DUNDi peered nodes share dialplan information with each other. The protocol does not actually carry any calls, but rather provides addressing information. Peers in a DUNDi cluster query other peers for a telephone number to which a call is requested by a user. The result of the query is a dial string for the Asterisk application Dial. The protocol was invented by Mark Spencer, the author of Asterisk. Peers Asterisk PBX systems that use DUNDi are peered as a cooperating system of DUNDi nodes, each having certain configuration to access a DUNDI instance on at least one other node. In the DUNDi configuration one can limit the number of consecutive lookups between peers by setting the TTL. * A TTL of 1 means you only can ask the peers you know and they cannot ask further. * A TTL of n means that the peer you ask for a lookup can redirect your lookup to the peers it knows, only with a TTL of n-1.  Advertising extensions  Each DUNDi peer can advertise its own extensions and their context. E.g. if you can connect some local E.164 number(s), you can advertise these. DUNDi configuration assigns a priority weight to each advertised extension. Low values represent a high priority and must be chosen first when more than one answer is received from a lookup.  Example In the Asterisk CLI one can do a lookup by hand to test if a DUNDi configuration works. asterisk1*CLI> dundi lookup 301@priv bypass 1\\\\. 0 IAX2/priv:ByWFbOGKgGmZbM43BJHSZw@192.168.1.2/301 (EXISTS) from 00:0c:29:d2:d8:ec, expires in 3600 s DUNDi lookup completed in 113 ms The above DUNDi lookup tells the PBX to ask the known peers if they know how to reach extension 301 in the \\"priv\\" network. The answer consists of 6 parts: * The used protocol to communicate is IAX2. * The context-name is \\"priv\\". * The secret key of the PBX, which can redirect you to extension 301 is ByW[...]HSZw (this changes periodically) * The address of this PBX is 192.168.1.2 (or some domainname, should be reachable by the calling party) * The extension to call is 301 (this can be different from what you asked for, e.g. when calls from the outside are not allowed directly to an internal extension) * \\"EXISTS\\" tells us the PBX is advertising this number. It is possible the PBX advertises a lot more extensions than really are connected, so it is no guarantee the extension can be reached. In order to prevent the network from overloading and at the same time keep the responses as quick as possible, the involved peers will cache the lookups they see. Because the used keys may become invalid after some period, each lookup has some expiry date. This defaults to one hour. When no context is given with a lookup, DUNDi defaults to the E.164 context. This means you are looking for normal (international) phone-numbers, like 0031201234567 (some bogus number in Amsterdam, The Netherlands) In order to do so, you have to peer with at least one other peer in the E164 trust group.

History The Company was set up with less than ¬£5,000, given to Richardson by his father in 1860. This was enough for him to found the Neptune Shipyard at Wallsend. Its first ship, a paddle steamer called Victoria, was launched on the River Tyne that summer. She was commissioned to carry passengers, carts and livestock between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, and is thought to have cost around ¬£700. At least part of Wigham Richardson's success in the latter part of the 19th century was through the surge in demand for passenger ships, taking emigrants to the New World. In 1903, Wigham Richardson merged with Swan and Hunter specifically to bid for the prestigious contract to build the . Their bid was successful, and she went on to capture the Blue Riband for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic - a record she held for two decades. Even today, she is the largest liner ever built on the Tyne. The company flourished, and between 1906 and 1912, no other company in the world could match it in terms of the tonnage of shipping produced. In 1907, for example, 15% of the world's shipping, in tonnage terms, was built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson. Wigham Richardson's ships Ships built by Wigham Richardson's Neptune Yard, prior to the merger with Swan Hunter included: *Potosi - POTOSI (2) was built in 1900 by Wigham Richardson & Co. at Newcastle with a tonnage of 5300grt, a length of 400 ft 6in, a beam of 50 ft and a service speed of 13 knots. Although built for the Valparaiso service, due to lack of trade, she was sold immediately on completion to the Russian Volunteer Fleet and renamed Kazan. In 1904 she was captured by the Japanese Navy Department and renamed Kasato Maru.It sailed to Brazil, bringing immigrants to the booming coffee plantations, She was acquired by Osaka Shosen K. K. in 1918 who retained her name but later amended it to Kasado Maru.She was converted to a freighter in WW2. In August 1945 she was bombed by the Russians in the Bering Sea. *Bathori - A single screw steam schooner, long, built in 1892 for Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Co. She flew the Austro-Hungarian flag. *Castelbank (later renamed Aidar) - Built in 1883 for G Tweedy & Co of Liverpool, and sank in 1896 following a boiler failure in the Mediterranean. Aidar was owned at the time by London Steamers and was carrying a cargo of grain and oil cakes between Odessa and Marseilles. The crew were rescued by a steamship called Staffordshire. *SS Clearwater (later renamed Ingalls and Yosemite) - A steamer built in 1894 and acquired by the US War Department in 1899. She was renamed Ingalls and used as an army transport ship until 1910 when she was transferred to the Navy. Renamed Yosemite, she remained in reserve before being decommissioned and scrapped in 1912. *CS Colonia - Built in 1902, at over long, Colonia was the largest cable-laying ship in the world until 1926. She was responsible for laying a cable from Sennen Cove, Cornwall, to Bay Roberts, Newfoundland, and from there to New York City. The cable was reportedly around in length, and weighed 13,500 tons. *Dryburgh Abbey - Built in 1881, 2311 tons, Cargo ship, renamed Kut Sang, Kichisho Maru, Kissho Maru, sank after collision in 1923. *SS Elisabeth Rickmer - Built in 1896 for Norddeutscher Lloyd, of Bremen, Germany, she was long. *Europa - Built in 1884 for the Lavarello Line of Italy, this single screw passenger ship was capable of and offered accommodation for 75 in first class, 52 in second class and 750 in third. She ran between Genoa and South America, for several different owners, until being scrapped in 1893. *Hannover - One of the larger passenger ships of her day, Hannover was built in 1899 for North German Lloyd of Bremen. She had a single funnel, twin screws and was almost long. Hannover had room for 120 people in second class and 1,850 in third class and made regular crossings between Germany and the United States and Canada until the outbreak of the First World War. She was then laid up at Bremen and surrendered to Britain in 1919. Two years later she was resold to North German Lloyd and refitted before resuming crossings between Bremen and New York. She was scrapped in 1932. *Malang - A steel cargo ship, built in 1898. After serving as a merchant ship in the Atlantic, she was acquired by the US Navy, in 1918, when she was fitted with two guns. She carried a crew of 62 and travelled at up to . She was decommissioned in 1919, and was returned to her owner, Rotterdamsche Lloyd. *Port Fairy (later renamed Dona Maria and Italian) - Launched in 1887 as Port Fairy, she was renamed Dona Maria by her first owners, the Anglo-Australasian Steam Navigation Co of Newcastle. She offered accommodation for 50 first class and 700 third class passengers. After her maiden voyage to Australia in 1888, she was sold to the Andresen Line. Until 1903, she sailed between Lisbon and New York via the Azores. In 1907 she was sold to the Booth Line of Liverpool, and renamed Port Fairy, before being sold to Ellerman Lines in 1909, and renamed Italian. She was scrapped in 1913. *Portia - A single screw schooner, built in 1885, long and across the beam. She was owned by CT Bowring & Co and registered at Liverpool. *Sikh (later renamed Regina Elena, Georgia, and Shinsei Maru) - Sikh was built in 1889 for the Mogul Line, and was a single mast, single screw passenger ship, with accommodation for 25 second class and 1,100 third class passengers.

In 1904 she was sold to Unione Austriaca, renamed Georgia, and second class accommodation was upgraded to first class. Three years later, she was sold to Japanese owners and renamed Shinsei Maru. She was sunk by US aircraft in 1945 close to Taiwan. *Silvia - An iron single screw schooner, built in 1885, which was unusual in that she was fitted with electric lights. She was owned by New York, Newfoundland & Halifax Steam Ships Co and registered at Liverpool. *St Olaf - Built in 1871 for the Norse American Line, with accommodation for 30 first class and 500 third class passengers.

GENUKI website: Gwennap. Retrieved may 2010 Toponymy The derivation of the modern form of the name Carharrack is uncertain. Craig Wetherhill Wetherhill, Craig (2005), Place Names in Cornwall and Scilly, Wessex Books suggests it is a corruption of the Cornish ker/cayr Ardhek meaning Arthroc's fort. Eric Rabjohns, a locally based local- historian, while acknowledging this possibility, also advances another two contenders.Rabjohn, Eric & May, Barrie (Eds.) (2003), The Book of Carharrack - Born of the Mines Halsgrove, Tiverton The first is that the name refers to a dwelling of religious purpose, a meeting place for travellers, originating from Carharrack's proximity to the pilgrimage trail between Canterbury and St Michael's Mount, which is known to have passed through the nearby villages of St Day to the north and Lanner to the south. The final option, again based on a corruption of the Cornish, this time of Car (or Caer) Harrack meaning a camp, enclosure, or settlement near the rock or Carn, presumably referring to the mass of Carn Marth whose granite bulk overshadows the village. Each derivative has a degree of evidence to support it. History Earliest references to the area appear around 1290, but references to dwellings on the current site only date from the 1700s. Boom years for the village were in the first half of the nineteenth century, with the expansion of the local mines which at peak employed several thousand people: Carharrack was the closest settlement and provided plenty of space for building. By the 1860s the copper industry in Cornwall was in decline and many residents emigrated in search of work. A Wesleyan Methodist Chapel was opened in 1815. The grade II* listed building was altered in the late 19th and early 20th-century and is now a methodist church. Carharrack church was opened on 20 February 1884 by Canon Phillpotts of Porthgwidden. It was built by Messrs Williams and Moyle for ¬£600 and holds nearly 200 people. The eastern window is a memorial to Miss Rogers of Trevarthian. During the latter part of the twentieth century the village suffered a progressive loss both of local employment and local facilities and although there have been various new housing developments around the village it now functions more as a dormitory village.

The site of the Consolidated Mines, formed in 1782 by the amalgamation of Carharrack Mine and several other local tin and copper mines, is immediately east of the village. The mines were served by the Redruth and Chasewater Railway (an early narrow gauge line) which connected them to quays at Devoran on Cornwall's south coast. The railway closed in 1915 and its course is now a long-distance footpath and cycleway, one of Cornwall's Mineral Tramway Trails. Carharrack is the type locality for the copper-arsenate mineral Olivenite, a crystalline lustrous rock which often has a green or olive hue.

Patent USX558111 showing character selection lever in position on a letter ready to be depressed to make a typed imprint. The typographer was an early typewriter. It was a mechanical innovation created by William Austin Burt. The mechanism was operated by hand to provide a printed ink impression on paper. Burt was a government surveyor and needed to get official correspondence done quickly. He observed office workers overwhelmed with laborious tasks of handwriting lengthy official documents that took a long time. Burt had a mechanical background so was inspired to make a machine that would speed up secretarial work. A friend of his in the newspaper business furnished typeface letters from a printing press for his experimental mechanism. Burt had two versions of his mechanical apparatus. The first was built in a wooden box that could be carried by hand. The second was a large advanced model that was mounted on four legs. The first working model provided by Burt for his 1829 patent was destroyed in the 1836 Patent Office fire. Although his typographer, as his innovation was first known by, could print neat documents the mechanism was slow as each letter had to be done by hand. His invention ultimately did not accomplish the goal of speeding up office work as he had intended.  History  Burt conceived the idea of a typing device when he observed office workers overwhelmed with the task of creating official documents in triplicate by hand. He reasoned that a printing machine could relieve many hours of the tedious task by automation. In the 1820s in his blacksmith shop he commenced the development of such an apparatus. His \\"typographer\\" constructed to the point of being able to print out a neat letter was patented as number 259 on July 23, 1829. United States Patent Office documents describe Burt's American machine as \\"the actual construction of a type writing machine for the first time in any country\\". It was the first practical typewriting machine ever made in America, although Pellegrino Turri had made one in Italy in 1808. The patent gave Burt the full exclusive rights to his new typewriter machine for 14 years, including vending or selling to others any or all of these rights as he saw fit, signed by President Andrew Jackson. All \\"type writing\\" machines, those that used letters of typeface, were generally given the name \\"typographer\\" from Burt's 1829 patent until 1874 by subsequent inventors who improved on Burt's machine. The concept ultimately came to be called a \\"type- writer\\" in 1874.Baron, p. 201 The word stayed hyphenated until the 1880s. William Ozmun Wyckoff, president of the New York State Shorthand Reporters' Association in 1886, and founder of the Remington Typewriter Company, publicized the unhyphenated name \\"typewriter\\". It became very well known, and the public finally accepted this as one word by 1919. Eventually, Burt's typographer was called a typewriter. In 1714, the British patent office issued a patent to English engineer Henry Mill for a typewriter; however, he never built it.Kane, item 3585 This first record of an initial attempt gave Mills time (14 years) to develop a model or at least a description of his \\"artificial machine\\"; however, the secret of how to make such a machine, if there ever was one, died with him. There is no record that it ever existed. There hasn't even been found a trace of any drawings or specifications. Christopher Latham Sholes is given credit for inventing the first \\"practical\\" typewriter. He was in fact the fifty-second person or possibly the 112th to reinvent a \\"type-writing\\" machine ‚Äì which he called a type-writer.Baron, p. 200 Some of the \\"type-writing\\" machines invented between Burt's 1829 patented machine and Sholes' 1867 type-writer are \\"The Projean Machine\\" (1833), \\"The Thurber Machine\\" (1843), \\"The Foucault Machine\\" (1843), \\"O. T. Eddy's machine\\" (1850), \\"The Fairbanks machine\\" (1850), \\"J. M. Jones' machine\\" (1850), \\"William Hughes' machine\\" (1851), John M. Jones \\"mechanical Typographer\\" (1852), \\"Thomas' typograph\\" (1854), \\"The Beach typewriter\\" (1856), \\"The Francis Typewriter\\" (1857), \\"The Hansen Machine\\" (1865), \\"The Livermore Printing Device\\" (1863), \\"Peeler Writing Machine\\" (1866), and \\"The Sholes and Glidden Typewriter\\" (1867) invented by three men (C. Latham Sholes, Samuel W. Soule, Carlos Glidden). Thomas Edison is even given credit for an electrified version in 1872. The Board of Electors at the National Shorthand Association of Detroit recognized Burt as a leader among typewriter inventors and one that ensured world-wide recognition of priority of American inventors in the typewriter field. French authors Henri Dupont and C. Senechal described Burt's typographer in great detail in their 1906 book Patent Burt demonstrating his typographer writer striking the lever hammer down to make a typed impression of letter selected The machine was a rectangular wooden box wide, high, and long. It mechanically worked by depressing a rotating lever so that an inked letter made contact with paper. A gauge that was designed in a circular clockwise fashion on the front of the box indicated the number of lines typed on the blank piece of paper that was up to 15 inches in length. The paper was attached to a velvet-like material belt. The belt rotated when the impression lever was depressed. The patent describes Burt's machine as having a set of typeface characters that were arranged on the under side of a set of parts that had a lever pivoted to swing vertically and horizontally. The desired typeface character is brought to the printing point by moving this lever horizontally to a position over the same character in the index, and the impression on the paper is made by then depressing the lever. Different styles of typeface characters could be used. They were arranged in two rows on a lever. The rows of typeface characters could be shifted on the lever to bring either one to the printing point. The paper was carried in an endless band that traveled crosswise of the machine and the band was moved for letter space by the impression lever every time the lever is depressed to print. The line space was made by shifting the frame carrying the printing mechanism toward the front or rear of the machine, with the paper remaining stationary. Ink- pads were located at each side of the impression point, and all the typeface characters, except the one in the printing position, were inked every time the impression lever was depressed. Upper and lower case typeface letters could be used. A dial was provided that indicated the length of paper (inches) which had passed the printing point in printing each line. The operator knew the width of the paper being used each time. There was a stop printing indicator for end of the line. Four classes of typewriters had been recognized by the U. S. Patent Office. The first was an index-wheel machine, like that patented by Burt on July 23, 1829. The second was the bar-machine first patented by John B. Fairbanks on September 17, 1850. The third was the plate-machine first patented by Oliver T. Eddy on November 12, 1850. The fourth was the key-wheel machine first patented by John Pratt on August 11, 1868. A complete working model of Burt's \\"typographer\\" was in the model room of the Patent Office from the time of the patent until the Patent Office fire of December 15, 1836. The fire destroyed all the patents and patent models issued from 1790. A competent mechanic can build a working replica of Burt's typographer from his patent description and drawings. Austin Burt, the great grandson of Burt, built a working model in 1892 for the World's Columbian Exposition working from a parchment copy of the original patent (No. 5581X). The reason Burt built the machine was to speed up his work in official correspondence as a government surveyor. John Pitts Sheldon of the Detroit Free Press, Burt's newspaper editor friend, furnished the typeface letters from the newspaper company in May 1829 for Burt's first typographer to be able to type the first letter ever written on it. The letter was to future president Martin Van Buren then Secretary of State. Two months later it received an official patent as one of the most unique and useful inventions of the time. It was the first patent for a type writing machine. Burt built in 1830 a second improved typographer typewriter that resembled a pinball machine because four tapered legs for standing were added to it. Sheldon had taken Burt's \\"moddle\\" to the Patent Office in Washington, D.C. on March 9 of that year according to a typewritten letter to his wife of March 13, 1830. The typeface letters for this Patent Office model was obtained from a Mr. White of New York, a typeface founder. Even though a neat-looking letter could be typed on Burt's \\"typographer\\", the basic goal to speed up correspondence was not accomplished, as his machine was very slow in typing. Because of this, the machine could not get marketed. Burt lost interest in it and sold his rights to one Cyrus Spalding for $75 on March 17, 1830 with suggested improvements. Ultimately he did not have any further luck in marketing the typewriter.Michigan History Magazine, article: \\"Willian Austin Burt\\", January 1922 The typographer was so far ahead of its time it found no market.

It lies on the east bank of the Carrick Roads, a large waterway created after the Ice Age from an ancient valley which flooded as the melt waters caused the sea level to rise dramatically. The immense natural harbour created is often claimed to be the third largest in the world. It was once a busy fishing port, but the trade declined during the 20th century and it now serves as a popular tourist location, with many properties in the village functioning as holiday accommodation. The village is in the civil parish of St Just in Roseland. History and geography The village takes its name from the Celtic saint Saint Maudez (Mawe), who may have come from Ireland but is mainly venerated in Brittany.Into Cornwall, St Mawes, Information about St MawesDoble, G. H. (1964) The Saints of Cornwall: part 3.

It was disfranchised in 1832. The town was described, in 1880, by an anonymous writer, > ... as a quiet little fishing village, and consists of a long straggling > street, fronting the water; it has, however a good pier, which was erected > in 1854; and a sea-wall, with a parapet was built not long ago, along the > centre front of the town. St Mawes Castle is a well-preserved coastal fortress from the time of Henry VIII, built to counter the invasion threat from the Continent. Charles Henderson, writing in 1925, says of St Mawes, \\"an ancient fishing town which in late years has assumed the different and more sophisticated character of a watering place\\". The seal of St Mawes was Az. a bend lozengy Or between a tower in the sinister chief Arg. and a ship with three masts the sail furled in the dexter base of the second, with the legend \\"Commune Sigillum Burgi de St. Mawes al Mauditt. Just outside the town is a closed British Leyland garage on Polvarth Road which retains the British Leyland logo on a hoarding outside. St Mawes lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Royal family St Mawes harbour There have been frequent private visits to St Mawes by members of the Royal Family including HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, HRH Princess Margaret and more recently the Duke (Prince Charles) and Duchess of Cornwall who ended their stay in July 2008 by naming the new St Mawes ferry The Duchess of Cornwall. HM The Queen visited St Mawes in 1977 during her Silver Jubilee Tour. In June 2002 for The Queen's Golden Jubilee and, with a brand new cast in June 2012 for the Diamond Jubilee, The Queen's Coronation was re-enacted in great detail by the young people of the village in a ceremony entitled \\"The Children's Coronation\\". Church history The church of St Mawes The name of the town comes from Saint Maudez, a Breton saint, and there was a chapel here dedicated to him with his holy well nearby. Its existence in 1427 is mentioned in George Oliver's Monasticon and it remained in use until the reign of Elizabeth I when it was abandoned. From that time until ca 1838 there was no chapel for the townspeople until a private chapel built in 1807 by the Marquis of Buckingham was licensed by the Bishop. This was on a different site and was rebuilt in 1881. St Mawes continued however to be in the parish of St Just in Roseland.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 115-16 St Mawes' Church, St Mawes was opened in 1884. There is also a Methodist church. It was built in the first half of the 19th century and is a Grade II listed building. Demographics According to 2011 UK census data, 714 people lived in St Mawes. 91% of residents were born in UK and the most common religion stated was Christian (74.8%). Cultural associations The Square, St Mawes The Agatha Christie film Murder Ahoy was filmed here, as was the 1964 film Crooks in Cloisters.

As of the 2010 census, the Interlochen census-designated place (CDP) had a population of 583. The community is noted for the internationally renowned Interlochen Center for the Arts. This summer art camp and year-long artist residency draws young artists from around the world, and perfects their skills in visual arts, music, dance, acting, writing, and film. History Interlochen takes its name from the Latin \\"inter\\", meaning \\"between\\", and the Scottish Gaelic \\"lochen\\", meaning lakes. Before the arrival of European settlers, members of the Odawa people lived between the lakes they called Wahbekaness and Wahbekanetta (now named Duck Lake and Green Lake, respectively). Beginning in the late 19th century, European settlers began logging and fishing industries in the area, and founded the small village of Wylie, one mile south of present-day Interlochen. Because of logging, the Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad (owned by the Buckley and Douglas Lumber Company of Manistee) extended its line north from Nessen City and arrived between the lakes in the fall of 1889. Similarly, the Chicago and West Michigan Railway extended its line north from Baldwin on its way to Traverse City in 1890. The two lines crossed in current-day downtown Interlochen where a depot and interlocking tower were located. The original townsite, however, was platted just south of the depot along either side of the M&NE; rail line in late 1889 or early 1890, with the business district centering on the now-former M-137 and Riley Rd/10th Street. As the lumber industry grew, the area became more deforested. However, it was predicted from the beginning that the area would become a popular summer resort, and so Buckley and Douglas set aside 186 acres of virgin pines between Duck and Green lakes for preservation. The result was Pine Park, a public retreat boasting virgin forests and pristine lakes. A small railroad depot named Pine Park Station was built. Visitors began flocking to the region during the warmer months to camp, fish, boat, and escape the heat of the crowded cities. Piggybacking on the vacation boom, local businessman Willis Pennington purchased land adjacent to Pine Park on the banks of Green Lake and opened the Pennington Hotel in 1909. In the mid-1910s, local representatives became worried that Pine Park would soon be logged off and so they lobbied the Michigan Legislature for help. The state ultimately allocated $60,000 in 1917 to purchase the property, and the newly acquired parkland was dedicated as The Pines, later renamed Interlochen State Park, the first state park organized by the state of Michigan (Mackinac Island was originally a national park before becoming Michigan's first state park in 1895). In 1928, the National High School Orchestra Camp was founded at Interlochen and evolved to become Interlochen Center for the Arts, which includes a summer camp as well as a fine arts boarding high school and public radio station. The camp has expanded to both sides of Karlin Road (previously designated as a highway, M-137, in 1930 but decommissioned in 2020,), and enveloped the entire village of Wylie. By the late 20th century, the railroads that brought students, vacationers, and lumber through Interlochen, had been removed. The north-south M&NE; railroad was removed in 1934, and the west-east C&WM; railroad (Pere Marquette Railway after 1899) removed in 1982. The area remains a popular vacation spot, with hiking, fishing, camping, boating, swimming, cross country skiing, and snowmobiling the most popular activities. Geography As the name suggests, Interlochen is situated between the two lakes of the original Odawa settlement. It is southwest of Traverse City at , and sits at an elevation of above sea level. The ZIP Code is 49643. Climate Interlochen lies close to the 45th parallel north, approximately halfway between the equator and the north pole. It, therefore, experiences typical Northern Michigan weather: very cold in the winter, and very warm in the summer. Interlochen is close enough to Lake Michigan that it experiences heavy lake-effect snow, but not close enough to be cooled by the Great Lake's breeze, furthering the extremes of the winter and summer seasons. However, other lake-effect precipitation in the summer is also present, causing lush greenery and magnificent thunderstorms, and making Interlochen picturesque in the summer as well as in the winter. Demographics According to the census of 2010, there were 583 people, 240 households, and 142 families residing in the Interlochen CDP. The population density was 470.0 people per square mile (181.5/km). There were 277 housing units at an average density of 223.3 per square mile (86.2/km). As of the 2010 census, the racial makeup of the CDP was 52.2% White, 43.2% Native American, 0.5% African-American or Black, 0.2% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.2% some other race, and 1.7% from two or more races. 1.9% of the population were Hispanic or Latino, who can be of any race. In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 25.4% under the age of 18, 8.9% from 18 to 24, 33.3% from 25 to 44, 24.0% from 45 to 64, and 8.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.3 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.6 males. Government The Village of Interlochen is an unincorporated community and does not have its own local government, but is governed locally by Green Lake Township. The township offices are located in Interlochen. Some governmental services are also provided by the county. Media Interlochen is home to 88.7 WIAA, which is run by the Interlochen Center for the Arts and operates as Northern Michigan's National Public Radio affiliate. Transportation Lake DuBonnet, just northwest of Interlochen  Highway  * runs along the northern edge of Interlochen. The highway mainly parallels the Lake Michigan shore, and runs for in a northerly direction from the Indiana-Michigan state line southwest of Niles to its terminus at I-75 south of Mackinaw City. Public transportation Interlochen is served by Traverse City's public transportation system, the Bay Area Transportation Authority (BATA) which serves most of the Grand Traverse region with dial-a-ride services. BATA debuted its first hybrid bus in December 2005. BATA recently completed a bus transfer terminal on Hall Street in Traverse City, which opened July 21, 2006. The terminal is used to transfer riders to different buses on different routes. BATA also links riders to the Greyhound terminal for regional and long-distance travel. Given the long dirt and gravel roads that cover much of Interlochen and its surrounding area, in 2011, BATA began an experimental transit program consisting of rentable skateboards, scooters, bicycles and cross country skis (only available during the winter seasons). The program is largely targeted at the area's sizeable student population. General aviation Green Lake Airport (Y88) is located three miles south of Interlochen.

Although neighboring √âvry is the official seat of the Arrondissement of √âvry, the sub-prefecture building and administration are located inside the commune of Corbeil- Essonnes. History Traces of human presence in the area date to the Palaeolithic and Neolithic ages; later it was a Gallo-Roman settlement on the main road from Paris to Sens. The name Corbeil is derived from the Latin Corbulium, from the Gaulish cor beel, meaning \\"holy house\\". Since the time of Aymon, comte de Corbeil (died 957), to the 12th century it was the chief town of a powerful county, which passed to Mauger, son of Richard I of Normandy. William de Corbeil (died 1136) became archbishop of Canterbury, but nothing is known for certain about his parentage. The Gothic church was built in the tenth century and rebuilt in the fifteenth century. Before the expulsion of the Jews Corbeil had a flourishing Jewish community, which numbered thirteenth-century scholars Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil and Perez ben Elijah. Peter of Corbeil (died 1222) was the teacher of Lotario de' Conti, who became pope as Innocent III. Representatives of the king of France signed two treaties of Corbeil in the town, the Treaty of Corbeil (1258) between France and Aragon and the Treaty of Corbeil (1326) between France and Scotland. Corbeil was besieged by the Duke of Burgundy in 1418. The Protestants of France attacked it in 1562 amidst the religious war called the First Civil War. In 1590 General Alessandro Farnese, who had come to the assistance of the Catholics in France, fought at Corbeil. The composer Camille Saint-Sa√´ns lived in Corbeil for some years of his youth. The commune of Corbeil-Essonnes was created on 10 August 1951 by the merger of the commune of Corbeil with the commune of Essonnes. The commune town hall (mairie) is located in Corbeil. Inhabitants of Corbeil-Essonnes are known as Corbeil-Essonnois. Economy In the 19th century, Corbeil-Essonnes was a centre of the flour-milling industry. Essonnes also had notable papermills. Today, X-Fab France SAS is headquartered here and operates a semiconductor fabrication plant. The site includes 25000 square meters of cleanrooms and a design center. The fab had been founded by IBM in 1964. In 1999 it was transferred into a joint venture between IBM and Infineon, operating under the name Altis Semiconductor(fr). In 2010 it was sold to Yazid Sabeg for one symbolic Euro. X-Fab acquired the assets of insolvent Altis in 2016. Transport Corbeil-Essonnes is served by Corbeil- Essonnes station which is an interchange station on Paris RER line D and on the Transilien Paris ‚Äì Lyon suburban rail line. Corbeil-Essonnes is also served by Essonnes-Robinson station on the Transilien Paris - Lyon suburban rail line and by Moulin-Galant station on Paris RER line D. The town is crossed by the EuroVelo 3 track. Education There are about 40 schools in Corbeil-Essonnes.\\"Annuaire : R√©sultats de recherche -> Corbeil-Essonnes.\\" French Ministry of Education.

The main community, which includes a school, is Oak Valley. Maralinga was the site, measuring about in area, of the British nuclear tests in the mid-1950s. In January 1985 native title was granted to the Maralinga Tjuaruta people over some land, but around the same time, the McClelland Royal Commission identified significant residual nuclear contamination at some sites. Under an agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and Australia, efforts were made to clean up the site before the Maralinga people resettled on the land in 1995. There are still concerns that some of the ground is still contaminated, despite two attempts at cleanup. History Nuclear tests and cleanup Maralinga was the scene of UK nuclear testing and was contaminated with radioactive waste in the 1950s and early 1960s. Maralinga was surveyed by Len Beadell in the early 1950s, and followed the survey of Emu Field, which was further north and where the first two tests were conducted. On 27 September 1956, Operation Buffalo commenced at Maralinga, as Emu Field was found to be too remote a site. The operation consisted of the testing of four fission bombs. Two were exploded from towers; one at ground level and one was released by a Royal Air Force Vickers Valiant bomber from a height of 30,000 ft (9,144 m). This was the first launching of a British atomic weapon from an aircraft.Operation Buffalo Operation Antler followed in 1957. Antler was designed to test the triggering mechanisms of the weapons. Three tests began in September. The first two tests were conducted from towers; the last was suspended from balloons. Yields from the weapons were 1 kiloton, 6 kilotons and 25 kilotons respectively. Participants in the test programme were prohibited from disclosing details of its undertakings. Risking incarceration, nuclear veteran Avon Hudson became a whistle-blower and spoke out to the media in the 1970s. His disclosures helped pave the way towards a public inquiry into the tests and their legacy. The McClelland Royal Commission of 1984‚Äì1985 identified significant residual contamination at some sites. British and Australian servicemen were purposely exposed to fallout from the blasts, to study radiological effects. The local Aboriginal people have claimed they were poisoned by the tests and, in 1994, the Australian Government reached a compensation settlement with Maralinga Tjarutja of $13.5 million in settlement of all claims in relation to the nuclear testing. Previously many of these facts were kept from the public. 1985 native title handback In January 1985, the land was handed over to the traditional owners, the Aboriginal people of the area (A·πâangu) who are a southern branch of the Pitjantjatjara people, under the Maralinga Tjarutja Land Rights Act 1984. They were granted freehold title, and the right to developmental funds from the State and Federal governments. They completed a move back into Oak Valley in March 1985,} a new community approximately NNW of the original township of Maralinga. Under an agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and Australia in 1995, efforts were made to clean up the site, being completed in 1995. Tonnes of soil and debris contaminated with plutonium and uranium were buried in two trenches about deep. The effectiveness of the cleanup has been disputed on a number of occasions. In 2003 South Australian Premier Mike Rann and Education Minister Trish White opened a new school at Oak Valley, replacing what had been described as the \\"worst school in Australia\\". Contamination fears Despite the governments of Australia and the UK paying for two decontamination programmes, concerns have been expressed that some areas of the Maralinga test sites are still contaminated 10 years after being declared \\"clean\\", as late as 2011.\\"Maralinga finally cleaned up\\", 7.30 Report, ABC TV, broadcast 1 March 2000\\"Maralinga: The Fall Out Continues\\", Background Briefing, ABC Radio National, broadcast 16 April 2000Parkinson, A., (2007), Maralinga: Australia's Nuclear Waste Cover-up, ABC Books, Sydney, Jim Green, \\"Nuclear waste and indigenous rights\\", Perspective, ABC Radio National, broadcast 7 February 2008, accessed 9 March 2008Philip Dorling. \\"Ten years after the all-clear, Maralinga is still toxic\\", Sydney Morning Herald 12 November 2011, accessed 12 Nov 2011 Climate *Temperature from 6.5 ¬∞C in winter to 44.7 ¬∞C in summer; overnight minimum of -3 C in winter. *Rainfall average 0.75 mm ‚Äì 1.25 mm Documentary film Maralinga Tjarutja, a May 2020 television documentary film directed by Larissa Behrendt and made by Blackfella Films for ABC Television, tells the story of the people of Maralinga. It was deliberately broadcast around the same time that the drama series Operation Buffalo was on, to give voice to the Indigenous people of the area and show how it disrupted their lives. Screenhub gave it 4.5 stars, calling it an \\"excellent documentary\\". The film shows the resilience of the Maralinga Tjarutja people, in which the elders \\"reveal a perspective of deep time and an understanding of place that generates respect for the sacredness of both\\", their ancestors having lived in the area for millennia. Despite the callous disregard for their occupation of the land shown by the British and Australians involved in the testing, the people have continued to fight for their rights to look after the contaminated land.

They are currently going through a starburst phase, in which the collision of clouds of gas and dust, with entangled magnetic fields, causes rapid star formation. They were discovered by William Herschel in 1785. General information Ground-based visible light image of the Antennae Galaxies NGC 4038 and NGC 4039 by the Liverpool Telescope The Antennae Galaxies are undergoing a galactic collision. Located in the NGC 4038 group with five other galaxies, these two galaxies are known as the Antennae Galaxies because the two long tails of stars, gas and dust ejected from the galaxies as a result of the collision resemble an insect's antennae. The nuclei of the two galaxies are joining to become one giant galaxy. Most galaxies probably undergo at least one significant collision in their lifetimes. This is likely the future of our Milky Way when it collides with the Andromeda Galaxy. Five supernovae have been discovered in NGC 4038: SN 1921A, SN 1974E, SN 2004GT, SN 2007sr and SN 2013dk. A recent study finds that these interacting galaxies are less remote from the Milky Way than previously thought‚Äîat 45 million light-years instead of 65 million light-years. They are located 0.25¬∞ north of 31 Crateris and 3.25¬∞ southwest of Gamma Corvi. The Antennae galaxies also contain a relatively young collection of massive globular clusters that were possibly formed as a result of the collision between the two galaxies. The young age of these clusters is in contrast to the average age of most known globular clusters, around 12 billion years old, with the formation of the globulars likely originating from shockwaves, generated by the collision of the galaxies, compressing large, massive molecular clouds. The densest regions of the collapsing and compressing clouds are believed to be the birthplace of the clusters. Timeline About 1.2 billion years ago, the Antennae were two separate galaxies. NGC 4038 was a barred spiral galaxy and NGC 4039 was a spiral galaxy. Before the galaxies collided, NGC 4039 was larger than NGC 4038. 900 million years ago, the Antennae began to approach one another, looking similar to NGC 2207 and IC 2163. 600 million years ago, the Antennae passed through each other, looking like the Mice Galaxies. 300 million years ago, the Antennae's stars began to be released from both galaxies. Today the two streamers of ejected stars extend far beyond the original galaxies, resulting in the antennae shape. Within 400 million years, the Antennae's nuclei will collide and become a single core with stars, gas, and dust around it. Observations and simulations of colliding galaxies suggest that the Antennae Galaxies will eventually form an elliptical galaxy. X-ray source Areas containing large amounts of neon, magnesium, and silicon were found when the Chandra X-ray Observatory analyzed the Antennae Galaxies. These elements are necessary in order for planets that may contain life (as we know it) to form. The clouds imaged contain 16 times as much magnesium and 24 times as much silicon as the Sun.

They were originally best known for minor contributions to early fictional narrative film and Boer War dramatisation films, but the discovery in 1994 of a hoard of film negatives led to restoration of the Mitchell & Kenyon Collection, the largest surviving collection of early non-fiction actuality films in the world. This collection provides a fresh view of Edwardian era Britain and is an important resource for historians.see \\"The Lost World Of Mitchell and Kenyon - Episode 1 - 4/6\\" Background  Following on from the first motion picture, made in October 1888 by Louis Le Prince in the United Kingdom, the first showing to a paying audience was by Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re of France, in Paris in 1895 and in London the following year, featuring La sortie des usines Lumi√®re showing workers leaving their factory gates in Lyon. Others in France and Britain soon made films, some in \\"the factory-gate film\\" genre, and when Mitchell & Kenyon came together they found themselves ideally placed in the heart of the industrial North of England. People were excited at the opportunity of seeing themselves on film, and there were commercial opportunities for short films featuring as many local people as possible. \\"We take them and make them.\\"  Sagar Mitchell and James Kenyon founded the firm of Mitchell & Kenyon in 1897. Under the trade name of Norden, the company was one of the largest film producers in the United Kingdom in the 1900s, with the slogans of \\"Local Films For Local People\\" and \\"We take them and make them\\", they operated initially from their respective business premises at 40 Northgate and 21 King Street, Blackburn. The first reported showing of a Mitchell & Kenyon film was a film of Blackburn Market, shown at 40 Northgate, in Blackburn, on 27 November 1897. The company produced films either on their own initiative or as commissioned by local businesses. In April 1899 the travelling showman George Green commissioned them to film workers leaving factories, to be shown at the Easter fair, thus beginning the showing of their films by a network of showmen. 1902 Street scene in Wigan: Includes a broadside poster for Fred Karno's company and an \\"Animated Photo\\" show Three Norden fiction films released in September 1899 ‚Äì The Tramp's Surprise, The Tramps and the Artist, and Kidnapping by Indians ‚Äì brought them to national attention. The success of their early films encouraged Mitchell to give up his shop and in September 1901 Mitchell & Kenyon moved into premises in Clayton Street, Blackburn, to concentrate on film production. Fiction production was not as extensive as their production of \\"topicals\\", but by 1903 the company had an outdoor studio at its premises at 22 Clayton Street, Blackburn, which was used in addition to outside locations. The Cinema Museum in London currently preserves 65 Norden fiction films. The showmen became self-publicising travelling cinematograph operators. Films taken during the day were shown on the same evening in fairground tents or local meeting halls and music halls with slogans like \\"see yourselves as others see you\\". Dramas took a while to catch on and the non-fiction actuality films were more popular. A typical two-hour programme would show drama, comedy, live actors and then the main attraction, local \\"topicals\\", with a brass band and the showman's commentary during the silent films, plus occasional sound effects from guns and members of the audience paid to scream and faint to add to the excitement. Topicals As well as workers streaming out of factory gates, Mitchell & Kenyon filmed street scenes, parades, marches, walking out on Sunday and the fairgrounds. Charmingly, as the crowds pass by there are usually a few who come up and stare or wave at the camera, in a way that nowadays annoys news presenters. The street scenes are busy with pedestrians wandering across in front of the slow horse-drawn carts and trams, some horse- drawn as well as the new electric trams, and Mitchell & Kenyon added variety by filming from moving trams. Bicycles abound, and they also showed the novel rarity, a motor car. Warships and steamboats are shown, and at the Liverpool docks emigrants are shown boarding ships such as the Cunarder bound for Boston, the films having been developed on the same day for relatives to see that night. Workers now had one week's holiday each year, albeit unpaid, and films were made in the thriving holiday resorts including Blackpool and Morecambe Bay. Leisure activities shown include boating on rivers, promenading in pleasure gardens and rolling Easter eggs. The parades and processions include carnivals with participants blacking up and doing 'golliwog' dance routines, and men dressed as both Dutch men and women doing a clog dance. Others show religious processions, carnival processions, charity parades and marches, and Temperance parades featuring their children's section, The Band of Hope. Military marches and parades were featured, as well as marches by the Boys' Brigade and the Church Lads' Brigade. News and re-enactments  The outbreak of the Boer War in South Africa in October 1899 brought new business opportunities to the company ‚Äì it turned its attention to the production of war films. Troops were shown marching off to join the war or coming back from the front, past flag waving spectators. Crowds were shown greeting war heroes, in particular Private Charles Ward of Leeds, the last man to receive the Victoria Cross from Queen Victoria herself, being interviewed by Ralph Pringle. Fictionalised scenes from the South African war and the Boxer Rebellion were filmed in the countryside around Blackburn. These are described as fakes, but the audiences may well have accepted them as dramatic re- enactments. Screenings were enlivened by smoke bombs and guns being fired. Mitchell & Kenyon's most innovative film was The Arrest of Goudie in 1901, which is arguably the world's first filmed crime reconstruction ‚Äì the film incorporates the actual crime locations and depicts the arrest of Thomas Goudie, a Bank of Liverpool employee who embezzled ¬£170,000 while involved in a gambling ring. The film was shown at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Liverpool only three days after Goudie's arrest. Goudie was subsequently jailed for ten years. A full detailed history of this film by Vanessa Toulmin can be found in \\"An Early Film Crime Rediscovered: Mitchell & Kenyon‚Äôs Arrest of Goudie (1901)\\", in Film History volume 16, no 1 (2004): 37‚Äì53. Sports The recent introduction of Saturday afternoons off work had made sporting events into popular mass entertainment. Mitchell & Kenyon filmed these events, taking care to get as many spectators in as possible as well as showing some of the action. They took the first known film of the newly renamed Manchester United, at the match they played on 6 December 1902 against Burnley ‚Äì the film was to have been shown that evening at the Burnley Mechanics' Institute, but the showing was cancelled as Burnley lost 2‚Äì0, and the film was never shown until its recent rediscovery. A match between Sheffield United and Bury in September 1902 featured William \\"Fatty\\" Foulke, one of the most famous players of his day who also played for Bradford City and Chelsea. They also filmed possibly the first football injury to be captured on film, when an Irish striker struck the goalpost in the Wales versus Ireland international match at Wrexham in 1906. For further details see Vanessa Toulmin, \\"Edwardian Sport on Film\\", International Journal of Sport in History, volume 26, no. 2 (2006). Rugby league and cricket matches were also featured, and when A.D. Thomas, who styled himself \\"the picture king, the mastermind of the world\\", heard of a cricketing scandal where the respected Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold was repeatedly no-balled by the umpire, Jim Phillips, he promptly commissioned a filmed re-enactment of Mold's bowling to prove that his technique was valid ‚Äì the first action replay, which was a popular success. Other films featured rowing events, horse trotting, athletics, cycle races and motor tricycle races. Comedy  As early as 1900 some fiction films included slapstick comedy with blundering policemen, in anticipation of the Keystone Kops and Charlie Chaplin more than a decade later. Diving Lucy of 1903 showed a lady's legs sticking up out of a pond in Blackburn's Queen's Park, and rescuers setting up a plank which a tubby policeman goes out on only to find it a hoax, at which the others let go and he falls in the water. It was an international success, in France and the U.S. where it was billed as \\"the hit British comedy of the year\\". To enliven some street scenes the showmen arranged for mock fights or hosing down a spectator, and slapstick was added to park scenes with male actors dressed as women falling off a donkey or in the water from a boat, revealing their petticoats under the long skirts of the time. Decline In May 1907 Sagar Mitchell resumed possession of his original business, S. & J. Mitchell, at 40 Northgate, Blackburn. The volume of film production seems to have tailed off from this date, and from 1909 was increasingly restricted to local events. By the mid-1900s the taste of audiences for seeing themselves was fading, and more structured films were coming into vogue and the company concentrated on their fictional output. The last surviving film dates from 1913. Mitchell was joined in his business by his son John in 1921. His partnership with Kenyon was formally dissolved around 1922 and Kenyon died in 1925. Mitchell carefully stored the film negatives away in the basement of his shop. He lived to the age of 85, and died on 2 October 1952. John continued to run the business until he retired in 1960. Discovery and restoration of the Collection In 1994 during demolition work in what had been Mercers toy shop in Northgate, Blackburn, two workmen were clearing out the basement when they found three metal drums like milk churns, and looked inside to see hundreds of small spools of film. On their way to the Lethbridges Scrap Metal Processors was Magic Moments Video which did cine to video transfers, and the workmen dragged in a churn and asked the proprietor, Nigel Garth Gregory, if the films were of any value. Knowing of local businessman and historian Peter Worden's interest in cinematography, Gregory phoned Worden and offered to arrange for the drums to be delivered to him. Following delivery Worden examined the rolls and realised that the film stock was highly volatile and stored the rolls in a chest freezer in his garage until their transfer to the British Film Institute in July 2000.

Worden, along with another local historian, Robin Whalley, researched the films and provided an invaluable introduction to the firm and their films in an article published as \\"Forgotten Firm\\" in Film History, volume 10, no. 1, 1998 (). The Peter Worden Collection of Mitchell & Kenyon Films has now been preserved by staff at the British Film Institute's National Film and Television Archive, carefully storing the dangerously flammable 35 mm nitrate negatives in rooms that are constructed with water tanks suspended above a glass ceiling so that if the stock should ignite, the resulting fire will cause the glass ceiling to fail and enable the suspended tanks of water to extinguish the fire. Painstaking film preservation techniques were used to produce remarkably clean and scratch-free positives, adjusting the speed to smooth out the variations in these hand-cranked films. The results are fresh and natural, offering an unparalleled social record of early 20th century British life. The University of Sheffield's National Fairground Archive and the British Film Institute were awarded a three-year research grant by the Arts and Humanities Research Board to research, catalogue, identify and contextualise the 800-plus films. This has culminated in a collection of essays The Lost World of Mitchell and Kenyon: Edwardian Britain on Film, edited by Vanessa Toulmin, Simon Popple and Patrick Russell and published by the BFI in October 2004 (, paperback, , hardback) and over 15 articles. The major catalogue and interpretation of the Collection has been published by the British Film Institute titled Electric Edwardians: The Story of the Mitchell & Kenyon Collection (London: BFI, 2006), by Vanessa Toulmin; it contains over 431 stills from the collection, an array of handbills and posters from the National Fairground Archive and 100,000 words of text and filmographic references. Also available is a companion DVD titled The Electric Edwardians with two hours of highlights from the Collection with extras on the archiving of the films, an essay by film historian Tom Gunning and an interview with the lead researcher on the Collection, Vanessa Toulmin. Other DVD releases include Mitchell & Kenyon in Ireland and Edwardian Sport on Film, though only available in Region 2. A prime-time three-part series The Lost World of Mitchell & Kenyon was shown on the BBC in January 2005 with enthusiastic commentary by historian Dan Cruickshank and interviews with descendants of people shown in the films, and is available on DVD from the BBC or the BFI. In 2014 The Life and Times of Mitchell and Kenyon was produced at The Dukes, Lancaster and the Oldham Coliseum, starring Gareth Cassidy, Liam Gerrard and Christopher Wright; with video elements by imitating the dog. The BFI and the NFA have toured the Collection extensively presenting over 100 shows throughout the North of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales and proving once again that local films for local people are as popular today as they were a century ago. Vanessa Toulmin of the National Fairground Archive has also presented specialist feature shows on the history of Rugby League with Professor Tony Collins, seaside entertainment with John Walton, and football history with Dave Russell. In May 2011, the Collection was inscribed in UNESCO's UK Memory of the World Register.\\"2011 UK Memory of the World Register \\", United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO, 2011.

Career Haberly was born in Ellsworth, Iowa, on December 9, 1896, and raised in Iowa and Oregon. After studying at Reed College and Harvard, Haberly was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study Law at Trinity College, Oxford. However, he became interested in fine printing while in England and began to print and bind books under his own imprint, the Seven Acres Press. He was named controller of the Gregynog Press, a well-known private press in Wales, in 1933, but his tenure with the press was brief and, by most accounts, less than satisfactory to all concerned. While with the press he commissioned a typeface, variously known as Paradiso, Gregynog, Gwendoline or Foligno; when he left he was presented with a supply of the type, which he later used, after returning to the United States, in the production of a number of hand-printed limited editions for which he served as author, illustrator, printer, and binder. In addition to his poetic work and \\"bookbuilding\\" activities, Haberly wrote a biography of George Catlin entitled Pursuit of the Horizon, and translated portions of Pliny's Natural History, and also wrote an account of his life as a printer in the United Kingdom.Haberly, Loyd.

But the death of Venantius, occurring suddenly at Methone, Achaia, prevented the pious travellers from going further. They returned to Gaul through Italy, and, after having stopped at Rome, Honoratus went on into Provence. Encouraged by Leontius of Fr√©jus, he took up his abode on the wild L√©rins Island today called the √éle Saint-Honorat, with the intention of living there in solitude.Clugnet, L√©on. \\"St. Honoratus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 17 Jul. 2013 Lerins Numerous disciples soon gathered around Honoratus, including Lupus of Troyes, Eucherius of Lyon, and Hilary of Arles. Thus was founded the Monastery of L√©rins, which has enjoyed so great a celebrity status and which was, during the 5th and 6th centuries, a nursery for illustrious bishops and remarkable ecclesiastical writers. His Rule of Life was chiefly borrowed from that of St. Pachomius. It is believed St. Patrick trained there for his missionary work in Ireland. Archbishop of Arles Honoratus's reputation for sanctity throughout the southeastern portion of Gaul was such that in 426 after the assassination of Patroclus, Archbishop of Arles, he was summoned from his solitude to succeed to the government of the diocese, which the Arian and Manichaean beliefs had greatly disturbed. He appears to have succeeded in re- establishing order and orthodoxy, while still continuing to direct from afar the monks of L√©rins. He died in the arms of Hilary, one of his disciples and probably a relative, who was to succeed him in the See of Arles. Hilary wrote the Sermo de Vita Sancti Honorati probably around 430. Honoratus' various writings have not been preserved, nor has the Rule which he gave to the solitaries of L√©rins. John Cassian, who had visited his monastery, dedicated to him several of his \\"Conferences\\". Saint Honorat d'Arles La Vida de Sant Honorat In the Middle Ages, Honaratus was the object of a pilgrimage in the Arles region, especially around L√©rins Abbey, because of the writings in Occitan of Raymond F√©raud (or Raimon Feraud), a monk who composed a hagiographical life for him around 1300 in Roquesteron.Un Dragon r√©appara√Æt en Proven√ße...

History  There is evidence that three different cultures of people have lived in this area since 10,500 BC, especially on Skegemog Point in Lake Skegemog and Elk Lake. Records show that a branch of the Algonquin people, known as the Mascoutin, lived in the area until around 1630s. The Ottawa and Chippewa peoples came in after this, until the early 1800s, when white settlers moved in, calling their new settlement Dunbar.

Biography  Pazienza was born in San Benedetto del Tronto, province of Ascoli Piceno (Marche), in 1956. Growing up in his father's town of San Severo, in Apulia, he enrolled in 1973 at the DAMS (Dipartimento di Arte, Musica e Spettacolo; Department of Arts, Music and Entertainment) of the University in Bologna.  Career  He made his debut in the spring of 1977 in the magazine Alteralter with his first comic story, \\"Le straordinarie avventure di Pentothal\\" (Pentothal's extraordinary adventures), the surrealistic and psychedelic story of an alter ego named after a sedative (Penthothal). He later participated to such editorial experiences as Cannibale, Il Male and Frigidaire, where he created hundreds of comics with his unique and unmatched style, grown out of American underground comics (as represented by visionaries like Rick Griffin and Victor Moscoso), Italian Renaissance art and Walt Disney comics. He was especially fond of the character of Goofy, which he appropriated for a humorous spoof on Italian hippiedom of the 1970s entitled Perch√© Pippo sembra uno sballato (\\"Why Goofy Looks Like a Pothead\\"), and a later, unfinished story entitled La leggenda di Italianino Liberatore (\\"The Legend of Italianino Liberatore\\", referring to his old friend Tanino Liberatore); he also said in an interview that Carl Barks, the creator of Uncle Scrooge, Magica De Spell and other characters of the Duck family, was a model for his art. Pazienza quickly developed an extremely personal body of work, alternating between playful comic cartooning ‚Äì at times politically charged, at times simply nonsensical ‚Äì and much more elaborate, dark, disturbing graphic novels, often dealing with drugs and wanton violence, with a liberal scattering of black humor throughout. In 1980 he created the character Zanardi and collaborated with the magazines Corto Maltese and Comic Art while also producing movie and theater posters, scene designs, record covers and advertising. He was extremely prolific through the 80s, penning hundreds of single-panel cartoons as well as longer, intricate stories usually centered on Zanardi. If Pentothal was emblematic of the Bologna of 1977 (with the political activism and the trend of psychedelic drugs), Zanardi is a creature of the cynical and non-committed 1980s. Pompeo, his last graphic novel depicting the gradual downfall of a heroin addict (a largely autobiographical character) up to his eventual suicide, is generally considered his masterwork; the post-face to this work testifies that Pazienza tried to start a new life and, for a while, quit drugs.  Memory  Andrea Pazienza died at age 32 in Montepulciano, from an overdose of heroin.Gino Moliterno, ed., Encyclopedia of Contemporary Italian Culture He is buried in cemetery of San Severo. In his memory in Cremona, the non profit association \\"Centro Fumetto Andrea Pazienza\\" was created to help young cartoonists develop their skills. In 2011, Andrea Pazienza was chosen by Italians #1 at the 150 Italians list which was dedicated to the 150 anniversary of the unification of Italy.150 Italiani ‚Äî Un progetto a cura di Fabriano boutique (2011)  Selected works  * Aficionados * Andrea Pazienza (1981) * Le straordinarie avventure di Pentothal (\\"The Extraordinary Adventures of Pentothal\\", 1982) where he describes with an incredible mix of realism and dream sequences the existential problems of the youth of the 1970s * Milo Manara e Andrea Pazienza (\\"Milo Manara and Andrea Pazienza\\", 1982) * Zanardi (1983) * Perch√© Pippo sembra uno sballato (\\"Why Goofy Looks Like A Pothead\\", 1983) * Pertini (1983), an homage to the (former) President of the Italian Republic Alessandro Pertini * Glamour Book (1984) * Tormenta (\\"Blizzard\\", 1985) * Cattive Compagnie (\\"Bad companies\\", 1985) * Glamour Book 2 (1987) * Pazeroticus (1987) * Zanardi e altre storie (\\"Zanardi and Other Stories\\", 1987) * Pompeo (1987), Pazienza's testament and autobiographical book.

The 80th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League champion Baltimore Orioles and the National League champion Philadelphia Phillies. The Orioles won, four games to one. \\"The I-95 Series\\", like the World Series two years later, also took its nickname from the interstate that the teams and fans traveled on, Interstate 95 in this case. This was the last World Series that Bowie Kuhn presided over as commissioner. This is Baltimore's most recent World Series championship, and also their most recent appearance in a World Series. This was the first World Series since 1956 in which the teams did not use air travel, as Baltimore and Philadelphia are approximately apart. It was the Phillies‚Äô second World Series appearance in four years. It would be 10 years before they would appear in the Fall Classic again and 25 years before they would win another. Preview Baltimore Orioles The Orioles were led by first-year manager Joe Altobelli, who succeeded Earl Weaver; Weaver retired to the broadcast booth after a 16-year managerial run from 1968 to 1982. Altobelli inherited a lineup led by first baseman Eddie Murray (.306 BA, 33 HR, 111 RBI), who finished second in the 1983 MVP voting, and shortstop Cal Ripken, Jr. (.318 BA, 27 HR, 102 RBI), who out-pointed Murray, 322‚Äì290, and won the 1983 MVP. Veteran outfielder Ken Singleton settled into the DH role, while the rest of the team was a corps of platoon players. The Orioles finished first in the AL in team home runs (168); first in OBP (.340); and second in runs, doubles, and walks. After winning 15 games in 1982, 37-year- old pitcher Jim Palmer started only 11 games in 1983, winning five and losing four. He won one game in this World Series and would be released by the O's at the beginning of 1984 after struggling early, retiring shortly afterwards. A younger staff headed by 18-game winner Scott McGregor (18‚Äì7, 3.18 ERA) and 25-year-old Mike Boddicker (16‚Äì8, 2.77) were flanked by 21-year-old Storm Davis (13‚Äì7, 3.59) and veteran Mike Flanagan (12‚Äì4, 3.30). Reliever Tippy Martinez posted a career high with 21 saves, while Sammy Stewart added nine wins out of the bullpen as the O's pitching led the AL in shutouts (15) and was second in wins (98) and ERA (3.63). The Orioles won the American League East by six games over the Detroit Tigers. They then defeated the Chicago White Sox, three games to one, in the American League Championship Series. Philadelphia Phillies The average age of the players on the Phillies' roster was 32 years. They were aptly nicknamed the \\"Wheeze Kids,\\" a contrast to the 1950 Phillies team whose average age of 26 years earned them the moniker \\"Whiz Kids.\\" Sports writers in Philadelphia joked at the time that this older team emphasized the veteran in their home ballpark, Veterans Stadium. The Phillies were trying to win Philadelphia its second World Title of the year as the Philadelphia 76ers had won the NBA Title back in June, as well as their second championship in four seasons ‚Äî having won the 1980 World Series. Joining 42-year-old first baseman Pete Rose were his Cincinnati Reds teammates from the \\"Big Red Machine\\" era, first baseman Tony P√©rez (age 41) and second baseman Joe Morgan (age 39). The team was led offensively by 33-year-old Mike Schmidt, who would have another MVP-type year with 40 home runs and 109 RBIs. No other teammate would hit over 16 home runs (Morgan) or drive in over 64 runs (catcher Bo D√≠az). Although veteran pitcher Steve Carlton won his 300th major league game during the regular season, he actually had a mediocre year at 15‚Äì16 ‚Äî his first losing season since 1973 when his record was 13‚Äì20. In his first full season with Philadelphia, John Denny would win the Cy Young Award with a league leading 19‚Äì6 record, and a 2.37 ERA, winning 13 of his last 14 decisions. Closer Al Holland would finish second in the league with 25 saves and win the NL Rolaids Relief Award. A pair of relief pitchers, 40-year-old Ron Reed and 38-year-old Tug McGraw, were on the active roster but McGraw would not see any World Series action. The Phillies outpaced their intrastate rivals, the Pittsburgh Pirates, by six games to win their fifth National League East division title in eight years. This was followed by a three-games-to-one victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series. It was only the fourth league championship for the Phillies in franchise history.team history Summary Matchups Game 1 John Denver, whose \\"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\\" was played at the seventh-inning stretch of each Orioles home game, sang the National Anthem. Phillies starter John Denny gave up a first-inning homer to Jim Dwyer, but that would be it for the Orioles as 40-year-old Joe Morgan tied it with a home run in the sixth off Scott McGregor. Morgan became the second-oldest man to hit a home run in the World Series (Enos Slaughter was just a few months older than Morgan when he hit one for the New York Yankees in the 1956 World Series). Garry Maddox led off the eighth with a home run off McGregor for the final margin. Denny got the win with relief help from ace Al Holland. The top of the seventh inning of Game 1 was delayed due to Howard Cosell's (in what would be his last World Series assignment; he was removed by ABC before the next World Series the network carried in 1985) interview with President Reagan on ABC. Some observers (such as author and journalist George Will) believe that the delay ultimately made McGregor cold to the point of him giving up the home run to Maddox. McGregor would eventually redeem himself as he was the winning pitcher (in a complete game) in the clinching Game 5. Ronald Reagan's visit marked the 12th time that a Chief Executive had attended a World Series game. The Orioles' loss in Game 1 marked the first time in six World Series that they had lost the first game. Game 2 Boddicker went the distance, striking out six and walking no one. He allowed only three hits and one run, a fourth-inning sacrifice fly by Joe Lefebvre. The O's got their runs in the fifth on a John Lowenstein homer, a Rick Dempsey RBI double, and a sacrifice fly by Boddicker, helping his own cause. Cal Ripken added an RBI single in the seventh. When the Phillies benched Pete Rose in favor of Tony P√©rez in Game 3, it ended a streak in which Rose played every inning of his 59 previous postseason games. It also marked the last time that a World Series game would be played at Memorial Stadium (1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979 and 1983). Game 3 Steve Carlton became the first 300-game winner to pitch in a World Series in 55 years (Grover Cleveland Alexander was the last). Carlton shut out the Orioles through five innings, buoyed by homers from Gary Matthews and Joe Morgan. The Orioles cut the lead to one in the sixth on a homer by Dan Ford. In the bottom of the sixth, the Phillies had two on and two outs with Carlton coming up to bat. Phillie manager Paul Owens went to the on-deck circle to chat with Carlton about staying in the game. Carlton said he was fine, but struck out for the final out. Carlton looked to be cruising with two outs in the seventh, but Rick Dempsey belted a double and went to third on a wild pitch. Benny Ayala pinch-hit and singled home Dempsey to tie it. Al Holland relieved Carlton to try to close out the inning, but John Shelby singled Ayala to put runners at first and second. Ayala scored the go-ahead run from second on an error by shortstop Iv√°n DeJes√∫s on a ball hit by Ford. Long-time Oriole pitching hero Jim Palmer got the win in relief as he, Sammy Stewart, and Tippy Martinez pitched six shutout innings in relief of Mike Flanagan. This win by Palmer, along with his first World Series win in 1966, marks the longest span (17 years) over World Series wins for an individual pitcher in major league history. Jim Palmer's win in Game 3 made him the only pitcher to win a World Series game in three different decades. Palmer is also, the only man to have played with the Orioles in each of their World Series appearances (, , , , , and 1983). With Palmer and Carlton earning the decisions, this was the last World Series game in which both the winning and losing pitcher were in the Hall of Fame until 1992. It was the first World Series game in which three Cy Young Award winners, Carlton, Palmer and Orioles' starter Mike Flanagan, pitched. This would not happen again until Game 1 of the 2012 Series, when Barry Zito, Tim Lincecum and Justin Verlander appeared. Game 4 Rich Dauer broke a scoreless tie by singling in two runs in the fourth off John Denny. The Phillies came back in the fourth off Storm Davis with an RBI double by Joe Lefebvre and took the lead in the fifth on an RBI single by Denny and an RBI double by Pete Rose. In the top of the sixth with one out, John Lowenstein singled and Dauer doubled him to third. O's manager Joe Altobelli then sent Joe Nolan, the first of four consecutive pinch-hitters, to the plate. Phils reliever Willie Hern√°ndez walked Nolan to load the bases. The next pinch-hitter, Ken Singleton, walked as well to force in Lowenstein with the tying run. Finally, John Shelby, hitting for Storm Davis, hit a sacrifice fly to put the O's ahead 4‚Äì3. The Orioles added an insurance run in the seventh on an RBI single by Dauer, who would collect three hits and three RBIs. The Phillies would get no closer than a single run in the ninth, as Tippy Martinez got his second save of the series. The crowd of 66,947 in Veterans Stadium was the biggest for the World Series since Game 3 in New York in 1964. This is the last World Series game with a scheduled daytime start played under sunny skies. Game 4 of the 1984 World Series was played under overcast skies at Tiger Stadium, and game 6 of the 1987 World Series (last World Series game with a daytime start) was played indoors at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Game 5 Throughout this series, both teams' big gun hitters had been held in check. Mike Schmidt was 1 for 16, while Eddie Murray was 2 for 16. In this game, however, Murray snapped out of it by belting two home runs and driving in three runs. Rick Dempsey, who would be named MVP, also homered and doubled and scored two runs. Scott McGregor pitched a complete game, five-hit shutout to give the Orioles the championship. It was Cal Ripken, Jr. who made the final putout of the series. The Phillies finished this Series with a team batting average of .195, with no one having a worse Series than Schmidt, going a paltry 1 for 20 (.050 batting average) and overall the lowest average for a World Series team since the 1974 Oakland Athletics. The winning Orioles hit only .213 in the series. The Philadelphia Eagles were originally scheduled to play the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday, October 16, at Veterans Stadium. Because of the scheduling conflict, the Eagles and the Cowboys, who were scheduled for two games against each other because they were in the same division, played on that day on the Cowboys' field, Texas Stadium. (Their other game had been scheduled for November 6 at Texas Stadium, and that game was played at Veterans Stadium.) Composite box 1983 World Series (4‚Äì1): Baltimore Orioles (A.L.) over Philadelphia Phillies (N.L.) Aftermath Pitcher Larry Andersen was the only person to play for the Phillies in the 1983 World Series and the 1993 World Series against Toronto. Also, this series proved to be Cal Ripken's only World Series appearance even though the Orioles shortstop would become baseball's iron-man as he would surpass Lou Gehrig by playing in his 2,131st consecutive game on September 6, 1995. Ripken would also make it back to the postseason in both the 1996 and 1997 seasons only reaching the ALCS each time. Teammate Eddie Murray would reach the World Series again but the 1995 Cleveland Indians would lose in six games. Storm Davis, John Shelby, and series MVP Rick Dempsey would reach the 1988 World Series, Davis with the Oakland Athletics and Shelby and Dempsey with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Baltimore became the first visiting team to win Games 3, 4 and 5 since , when the New York Yankees did so vs. the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field. This has occurred twice since 1983. One was , when the Yankees again did it, this time against the Atlanta Braves in the final three games played at Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium. The other was , when the Houston Astros did it against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park, although the Astros became the first team to lose a World Series after winning games 3, 4 and 5 on the road, dropping games 6 and 7 at Minute Maid Park. By comparison, the home team has swept Games 3-5 12 times since .

The band comprised vocalist/rhythm guitarist Paul Draper, bassist Stove King, lead guitarist/backing vocalist Dominic Chad, and drummer Andie Rathbone. It was announced in May 2003 that the band had split up earlier that year, whilst in the process of recording their fourth album, and some of their archival recording of the album later released on their final album, Kleptomania (2004). History Formation Paul Draper and Stove King met in the early 1990s, whilst working in the printing industry as photo retouchers for rival companies situated opposite each other on the same industrial park in Little Stanney on the outskirts of Chester. Through their shared love of David Bowie and 1980s new wave bands including Duran Duran and ABC they started socialising together at weekends, going to gigs in Liverpool and playing along to drum loops together in their bedrooms with the desire of forming a band together.Reid, Pat, Burning Ambition - Mansun's Stove, web.archive.org. Retrieved August 2011 Whilst King was a relative newcomer to playing bass, Draper had previously formed and fronted the electronic duo Grind whilst studying at Thames Polytechnic (now University of Greenwich), with programmer- keyboard player Steve Heaton, and were often accompanied live by school friend Carlton Hibbert on drums. Grind released one 12\\" single in 1991 on the small \\"Whats in It For Me Records\\" label and gigged around London at venues such as The Rock Garden and The Brain and also supported Beverley Craven at the Mean Fiddler. Following the split of Grind, Draper, funded by a grant from The Prince's Trust, set up a music company called \\"Ambiance Productions\\" producing relaxation tapes to be sold in \\"hippie shops\\" across the north west of England. In early 1995 Draper and King enlisted Maidstone expat Dominic Chad, who was the bar manager at the Fat Cat pub on Watergate Street in Chester opposite the office where Draper would go and see former Grind member Steve Heaton. Chad had previously played with \\"Floating Bear\\" formed whilst at Bangor University in 1990, where he had been studying French and Russian but was kicked off the course due to lack of effort. Chad would later admit that his routine during university was \\"get up at three, go down to the union bar at four and stay there until it shut\\". With the aid of a drum machine, the trio began rehearsing at Crash Rehearsal Studios in Liverpool, where the band were quickly discovered by passing A&R; scouts Mark Lewis and Alan Wills (who later went on to form Deltasonic Records) who were there to see Cast and overheard the band through their rehearsal room door. The band were offered a publishing contract with Polygram Music Publishing four days after reluctantly handing over a demo tape of 4 songs that cost ¬£150 to record featuring \\"Take It Easy Chicken\\", \\"Skin Up Pin Up\\", \\"Moronica\\" and \\"She Makes My Nose Bleed\\". Early days (1995‚Äì96) The band were initially called Grey Lantern, after Draper's DC Comics influenced alter ego which he created to help overcome his nervousness on stage, but soon changed their name to \\"Manson\\", after the cult leader Charles Manson. The band's self-financed debut release \\"Take It Easy Chicken\\" in September 1995 on their own \\"Sci-Fi Hi-Fi Recordings\\" label soon attracted the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq and John Peel and the band found themselves, despite not having played a single gig and later admitting that they couldn't play together as a band very well at the time, at the centre of a record label bidding war. This resulted in the band signing to Parlophone, with whom they released the follow up single \\"Skin Up Pin Up / Flourella\\" in November 1995 on sublabel Regal Recordings, although this time under the new moniker \\"Mansun\\" as they were forced to change the spelling due to threatened legal action from the Charles Manson Estate. The band gave several false accounts of this at the time, one being that they were named after The Verve B-side \\"A Man Called Sun\\", and that \\"Manson\\" was simply a spelling mistake which accidentally went through to production. It was later reported that Charles Manson had started spelling his name with a \\"u\\", to which Draper joked that they should sue him in return. Following the release of \\"Skin Up Pin Up / Flourella\\", the band were moved up to the main Parlophone label and released several EPs, including an expanded re-release of the debut single. The first lineup of the band alongside Draper, King and Chad had featured former Grind drummer Carlton Hibbert and drum machine programmer Mark Swinnerton. Following five months of touring, starting with the band's first gig in August 1995 at The Lomax in Liverpool and support gigs with Heavy Stereo and The Charlatans, Swinnerton left the band in January 1996. As a four piece, the band continued touring including support gigs with Cast, Audioweb and Shed Seven until Hibbert was sacked from the band in May 1996 following a series of rows with an inebriated Chad that resulted in a bizarre incident that involved a pineapple being thrown at Chad's face in Cambridge, where the band were supporting Shed Seven. Throughout the early days of the band, Chad was involved in a string of violent alcohol fueled incidents. These included punching his own reflection in a hotel mirror, being thrown out of a pub after attempting to drop kick the bar, throwing pint glasses out of a window in Sheffield, getting himself banned along with the rest of the band from every outlet of the now defunct roadside restaurant chain Happy Eater, all Hard Rock Cafes worldwide and every Holiday Inn hotel in the UK after drop kicking a statue of the Venus de Milo. Ex-Kinky Machine drummer Julian Fenton was temporarily drafted in for gigs and featured in the promo videos for \\"Take It Easy Chicken\\" and \\"Stripper Vicar\\". In August 1996 Andie Rathbone joined, a well known drummer in Chester who had been playing regularly with several bands including DNA Cowboys, The Wandering Quatrains and Jonti. Having auditioned several drummers without success, the band took a break at a local pub where \\"there was the best rock drummer we'd ever seen, playing with this really dodgy band\\", but the drummer, who was also working as an Audi car salesman at the time, initially rejected the bands pleas to join the band, as he thought the band played \\"Britpop shite\\". He changed his mind after King played him a demo of one of the band's latest songs, \\"Wide Open Space\\". Rathbone's first gig with the band was performing \\"Stripper Vicar\\" live on TFI Friday, having missed the previous nights gig in Brighton due to getting a train to Bristol Temple Meads by mistake and having to check the gig guide in the NME to find out where the gig was. Attack of the Grey Lantern (1997) February 1997 saw the release of the band's critically acclaimed debut album Attack of the Grey Lantern. Although the band had finished recording most of the album prior to Rathbone joining, they went back into the studio to record new songs \\"Taxloss\\" and \\"Mansun's Only Love Song\\" and re-record several drum tracks. The album appeared to contain a conceptual storyline, which Draper referred to as \\"small town weirdo observations\\" and was influenced by comedies The Goon Show and Monty Python, whilst ending with a hidden track, \\"An Open Letter to the Lyrical Trainspotter\\", proclaiming (reportedly sarcastically) that \\"the lyrics aren't supposed to mean that much\\". The album knocked labelmates Blur's self-titled album from the top spot of the UK album chart after only being released the week before. During the early days of the band, Mansun were noted and sometimes derided for their constantly changing fashion styles. Such styles ranged from punk, new romantic, baggy \\"Madchester\\" clothes, army fatigues, A Clockwork Orange style boiler suits and even women's clothing. Draper admitted that it was \\"probably overenthusiasm, seeing people like Bowie's different guises and thinking, 'Great! Let's try that.'\\" Six (1998‚Äì99) Following the release of the standalone \\"Closed for Business\\" EP in October 1997, the band found themselves short of songs going into the studio sessions at Olympic Studios for second album Six. Suffering from writer's block, Draper took inspiration from books Chad had taken out with him on tour, such as 120 Days of Sodom by Marquis de Sade, The House at Pooh Corner by A. A. Milne and Dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard by quickly scanning them to get the gist of the books and then forming lyrics based on them. Many of the musical ideas were assembled during soundchecks on the previous US tour. Chad admitted that the band \\"had all these ideas that we came up with on tour, but we didn't have any complete songs. For the album, we simply recorded all the musical snippets, and then figured out key and tempo changes that would link the sections together\\". With the lack of complete songs going into the album sessions, Draper set out to put together enough material at the weekends in the band's rented accommodation in Barnes so that there was enough material each week for the band to work on. Through constant touring, the band were now confident to record as a band in the studio and set out to replicate their live sound and make the album heavier and more guitar based in contrast to the more commercial sounding drum loop and synthesiser based sound of the debut. On the Chad penned \\"Witness to Murder Part II\\", the band enlisted former Doctor Who actor Tom Baker to perform the monologue, with King admitting that \\"the whole band are big fans of Dr Who and Tom Baker, so we thought he'd be ideal. Tom heard the track and immediately agreed to perform on it\\". The track was intended as an interlude between two sides of the album, as if it was a vinyl record, but Chad later stated he regretted putting it on the album. The original idea was to package the CD version of the album in a 12\\" gatefold sleeve to replicate the vinyl experience, but was abandoned due to possible issues with getting it stocked by retailers. The album was preceded by the singles \\"Legacy\\", which provided the band with the highest charting single, and \\"Being a Girl\\". Several more singles followed the release of the album, including \\"Negative\\" and a re-recording of the album's title track, \\"Six\\" produced by Arthur Baker. Draper later admitted to placing the two main singles at the end of the album to be awkward, and tried to avoid having choruses on the album, leaving many of those tracks to be released as b-sides, which he thought would have made a better rock album. He described the album as being \\"commercial suicide\\". Little Kix (2000) Mansun's third studio album, Little Kix (early working titles included Magnetic Poetry and The Trouble With Relationships,) saw Draper and Chad decamp to the south of Spain in March 1999 where they wrote and demo'd ideas for the album. Draper claimed that following the commercial and critical disappointment of Six, he didn't feel any pressure to follow it up and therefore set out to go in a different direction with the new album. Prior to the writing trip in Spain, he had decided that the new album would be more \\"acoustic-guitary\\" and wanted to prove to himself that he could still write pop songs with choruses. The album was recorded at Astoria, a houseboat-studio owned by Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, with former XTC and Police producer Hugh Padgham, Despite initially admitting that the album was \\"all about 'What do you want out of your life, what do you want out of a relationship?' And I didn't want to make another disillusioned, really dark record\\", and that \\"anyone who gets Little Kix knows it's a good album\\" Draper refused to tour or promote the album. \\"I Can Only Disappoint U\\" gave the band their biggest selling single to date and second highest charting single after \\"Legacy\\", but Draper's refusal to promote the album led to the album stalling at #14 in the charts. He later admitted that whilst they were trying to make a \\"timeless record\\", he \\"just don't think we realised the record we were making until towards the end\\" and Chad also later stated that the album \\"just didn't sound like us because there was lots of keyboards\\". Several years following the split of the band, Draper claimed that he was demoted as the band's producer as the rest of the band were no longer comfortable with him producing and the label reportedly wanted to ensure the band didn't go off on another tangent as with Six, and was forced to work with an outside producer for the first time, stating that \\"the management wanted a soft rock album made behind my back for some reason and I got manipulated into releasing it\\" and that the band were \\"steamrollered into doing a commercial sounding 3rd album\\". Aborted fourth album and split (2001‚Äì2003) In January 2001, prior to the final single \\"Fool\\" being released off Little Kix, Draper informed the NME that the band were set to enter the studio in March or April of that year and that the band wanted to release new material as soon as possible. In April, Draper told fans through the official website that the band had recorded and mixed eight new songs and would continue recording in May. The band were considering their options as to whether to release an EP or to hold the material back for a full album. In August, Chad posted on the band's official website to inform fans that the band had abandoned plans for an EP and were now halfway through recording their fourth album, which would be \\"harder\\" than Little Kix and that they planned to release a single in December. The band's aim for the record was to make it as representative of Mansun as a live band as possible, that it sounded \\"like a live band playing in a room\\" but also that it had all the \\"creative sounds that Six had\\". In October 2001 the Mansun ansaphone service operated by King since the early days of the band went down. In March 2002 and with no sign of new material, it was claimed that the delay in the new album being finished was due to Chad's injuring his hand after falling into a fire grate, keeping him from playing for four to five months, but confirmed that the band had so far finished 15 songs. Draper later revealed that he had been diagnosed with cancer during recording sessions at Rockfield Studios, after a blister appeared on his left hand middle finger that kept bleeding. He visited a local doctor who took a sample of tissue from the finger. It was confirmed that it was malignant and was known as a \\"Bowenoid malignancy,\\" and Draper responded positively to five cycles of chemotherapy. However, he was unable to play for several months after his finger swelled up following treatment In April and May 2002 the band embarked on a low-key UK tour, which was initially planned to be secret and promoted under the pseudonym The Masons. The band played short ten song sets on the tour, one half old songs and the other half new songs set to appear on their forthcoming album. One website prophetically reported that the tour would be the band's last, although this was denied at the time. In the following October, Chad revealed that a planned studio session for that month had been abandoned as they had wanted to continue writing. Following extended delays in the band delivering the new album to Parlophone, rumour spread in December 2002 that the band had been given an ultimatum that if they didn't complete the album by early in the new year, they would be dropped. In January 2003, a posting on the band's official Yahoo list claimed that a member of the band had left \\"amid massive animosity\\", later elaborating that \\"a member of the band had quit, did not want to rejoin and the remaining members did not want him back\\" and that as a result of this, the band had split up. Following months of speculation, the band's split was officially announced on 2 May 2003, with the press release stating that the band decided to call it a day after realising that \\"the life of the group had come to an end\\". Chad commented on the split, that \\"there's nothing sinister behind it, it was completely amicable. We all just want to be able to do other things\\". It was later revealed that the announcement had been delayed as Draper had unexpectedly fled to the US with no fixed date of return and that King was the band member who had left just prior to the band splitting. Despite Chad having proclaimed the new material to be their best work yet, incorporating elements of all the band's previous albums and praising Draper's writing as being better than ever, Draper later claimed that when working on the new album, none of the band's hearts were in it and in 2008 went on to blame Chad for the split, stating that the guitarist \\"wasn‚Äôt happy with the working method of writing and recording, but didn‚Äôt want to implement his own writing and recording method so we simply had to go home and end the band\\". Rathbone described the album as being \\"the first album that captured an essence of the live sound\\", but also that the sessions were frustrating and revealed that towards the end, the band had split into two camps - himself and King who still resided in Chester, and Draper and Chad who had moved to Weybridge, Surrey. In September 2015, Draper went on to further claim that Chad tried to sack him from the band several times following the release of Little Kix. He stated that Chad \\"didn‚Äôt want me to be the producer or the songwriter and he wanted me replaced by another singer and for the band to be more like The Seahorses, remember that band with John Squire? He wanted the songs to come out of jams in rehearsal rooms\\". Further commenting on the band's split, Draper claimed that \\"one or two members did way too many drugs and a lot of people interfering, it wasn‚Äôt handled properly and it ended in disaster\\". Kleptomania and other releases (2004‚Äìpresent) With news of the split being confirmed and with the knowledge that most of the fourth album, which was set to be self titled, had already been recorded, an online petition was set up by fans to persuade Parlophone to release the material. The tracks intended for the album were then released in September 2004, along with the non-album singles and a selection of B-sides (compiled by Draper from a top 20 voted for by fans on the band's official website) and rarities in a 3 CD box set entitled Kleptomania. Draper later claimed that after Parlophone contacted him to ask whether he wanted to be involved in putting together the album sessions for release, he tried to reform the band to properly finish it but no one else was interested. Legacy - The Best of Mansun was released in September 2006, with a limited edition CD/DVD release also issued containing promo videos for every single plus a documentary and other bonus material. The CD also provided access to download the previously unreleased \\"South of the Painted Hall\\", which was originally set for release on Kleptomania, but the multitrack was incomplete, missing the lead vocal. The free download version is sourced from a reference CD-R which featured a rough mix with a guide vocal. In March 2008, on the prospect of a Mansun reunion, Draper stated that whilst he and Andie Rathbone were interested, \\"Dominic Chad would never do it, so it can't happen\\". In 2010, Rathbone commented that it was a \\"pity the three others couldn't stop dramatising the problems and get out again, as we'd be phenomenal\\". In 2011 Rathbone again confirmed his and Draper's desire to reform the band, but added that a reunion would have to include all four band members and that neither King nor Chad were interested. An article in The Guardian on 24 December 2011, entitled \\"The Guide's guide to the next 12 months\\", claimed that the band were set to reunite in 2012 with a new album planned, but was later denied by official sources and confirmed to be a mistake by the article's author. Solo activity Following the split, Draper worked with ex-Skunk Anansie singer Skin on songs for her Gordon Raphael produced album Fake Chemical State, and recorded demos for artists such as Komakino and Catherine A.D.

Devilfish was launched on 30 May 1943 by Cramp Shipbuilding Co., Philadelphia; sponsored by Mrs. Frank W. Fenno Jr.; and commissioned on 1 September 1944, Commander Edward Clark Stephen in command. Service history Devilfish aided the training program of the Fleet Sonar School at Key West from 18 October-2 November 1944. She reached Pearl Harbor on 2 December. On the last day of the year, she sailed on her first war patrol, putting into Saipan to refuel from 12‚Äì15 January 1945. Devilfish patrolled the dangerous waters of Kii Suido and Bungo Suido off the island of Shikoku, and served as lifeguard for Army pilots making bombing raids on Japan. She refitted at Guam from 13 February-15 March, called at Saipan, and sailed on 16 March for her second war patrol. Assigned to the area between Sagami Wan and the northern Nanp≈ç Islands, Devilfish was attacked by a kamikaze plane on 20 March before she entered her patrol area. The plane crashed into her as the submarine was submerging, destroying the mast structure and causing serious leakage. Devilfish returned to Saipan and Pearl Harbor for repairs, departing Pearl Harbor on 20 May on her third patrol. She sought targets in Bungo Suido and off northern Honsh≈´, and on 16 June, in heavy seas, attacked an enemy submarine carrying a midget submarine on its deck. On 26 June, she attacked an escort ship, but in both cases the targets escaped. During this patrol she acted as lifeguard for strikes accompanying the Okinawa operation, and several times rendezvoused with other submarines to take off medical cases and previously rescued aviators. The USS Devilfish pulled in to Guam to refit from 7 July-2 August, then sailed to the Nanp≈ç Islands for her fourth war patrol, during which her primary mission was lifeguard duty for the 3rd Fleet raids on Japan. On 10 August, she bombarded Tori Shima, and on 16 August, after the end of hostilities, departed for Midway and San Francisco. Devilfish, being sunk as a target by , 1968. There she was placed in commission in reserve on 18 April 1946, and out of commission in reserve on 30 September 1946. Laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Devilfish was redesignated AGSS-292. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1967. Devilfish was sunk by the submarine USS Wahoo (SS-565) off San Francisco, California on 14 August 1968, as part of a MK 16 MOD 8 torpedo test at in 2000 fathoms (12,000 feet or 3,700 meters) of water.

It existed only a short time before being amalgamated into the new Labour Party. During its period of existence, the party held two seats in Parliament. Unity Conference The Social Democratic Party was founded in January 1913 at a so-called \\"Basis of Unity\\" Conference (often simply called the \\"Unity Conference\\"). This meeting drew together the most prominent left- wing groups in New Zealand, including both political parties and trade unions. The aim was to unite the fractious labour movement into a cohesive force. At the end of the Conference, most of the attendees agreed to merge into two new organisations ‚Äì the new United Federation of Labour would co-ordinate the trade unions, while the two main political parties (the hard-line Socialist Party and the moderate United Labour Party) would merge to form the Social Democrats. Not all members of the United Labour Party accepted the plan, however, and some continued on under the same banner and continued as a Rump party. The Social Democrats were founded with the purpose of becoming \\"...the political embodiment of working-class ideals aspirations\\" in parliament. Jack McCullough was the organiser for the Lower Riccarton branch and also organised campaigns for Christchurch City Council elections. Strike and 1914 election The Social Democrats gained a rapid boost when, shortly after their formation, Paddy Webb and James McCombs won by-elections and entered Parliament. They joined with John Robertson, who won a seat in the 1911 election as a Labour candidate bringing the Social Democrat caucus to three. Later the same year, however, a controversial strike broke out among groups of dockworkers and miners. Moderates in the union movement considered the strike ill-advised and dangerous, while radicals strongly supported it. The strike was heavily suppressed by the government of William Massey, and the United Federation of Labour was left broken and disorganised. The Social Democrats, still closely linked to the United Federation of Labour, were plunged into disarray, with three of the party's leaders, Harry Holland, Peter Fraser and Bob Semple, being jailed for their roles in the strike. As a result of the chaos, the Social Democrats went into the 1914 elections with little in the way of planning. Co-operation with local labour organisations was sporadic, as was co-operation with the remnants of the United Labour Party. However, union anger at the government for its \\"heavy-handed\\" response to the 1913 strikes was still strong, and the outbreak of World War I had also strengthened the labour vote. In the election, Paddy Webb and James McCombs retained their seats under the Social Democratic banner while the remnants of the United Labour Party won three seats, and a labour-aligned independent John Payne was also successful. By 1915, the Social Democrats had in its ranks 2 MPs, 2 Mayors; 17 city and borough councillors, 6 members of hospital and charitable aid boards and 2 members of harbour boards. The six labour-aligned MPs worked together in Parliament despite being from different parties, with Alfred Hindmarsh of the United Labour Party selected as the unified caucus' chairman. In August 1915, when Massey formed his Liberal-Reform coalition government, he extended an invitation to Hindmarsh's caucus. The \\"Labour\\" members declined the offer and, as a result, became the official Opposition in Parliament. Group photo from the Social Democratic Party Annual Conference in Wellington, 1914. Formation of the Labour Party Two years later, in 1916, the close working relationship between the Social Democrats and the ULP remnant was formalised with a merger ‚Äì the two officially came together as the Labour Party, the same organisation that survives today. The organisation of the Social Democratic Party survived however, and the more militant inclined members of the newly formed Labour Party remained as an \\"alter-ego\\" of Labour still campaigning for the goal of complete socialisation until their eventual disbandment in June 1922.

Geography Nanjemoy is within the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, approximately 25 miles (40 km) south of the Capital Beltway (Interstates 95 and 495). The area is served by Maryland Route 6 and other two-lane state highways; the nearest major roads are Maryland Route 210 to the north and U.S. Route 301 to the east. The Nanjemoy area is becoming increasingly popular with Washington-area commuters, particularly those working in nearby Indian Head or Fort Washington in Maryland or in Alexandria, Virginia. The Waldorf, Maryland and La Plata, Maryland, commercial areas are nearby to the east, along U.S. 301. No rail lines presently serve the area. Other settlements in the Nanjemoy area include Grayton, Maryland Point, and Riverside. Chickamuxen, Doncaster, and Ironsides are nearby to the north. The settlement lends its name to the Nanjemoy Formation, which outcrops on the nearby shores of the Potomac River. Other fossiliferous formations which outcrop nearby are the Aquia and basal Calvert Formations. Economy The village center includes a Post Office and a county-operated community center building that serves the area's population. The area has two children's camps and a sheriffs' training facility . Much of the Nanjemoy area is forest or farmland. Tobacco was formerly commonly cultivated in the area, but is now rarely grown there. History Arctic explorer Matthew Henson, photographed in 1910 Nanjemoy and the creek draw their names from a Native American tribe. The Confederate-sympathizing area saw occupation by a large force of the Union army during the early part of the American Civil War, with an encampment of about 12,000 soldiers near Chicamuxen, a few miles (kilometers) north of the Nanjemoy area. In the last years of World War I, the Allied sea-power had been weakened by German submarines. The U.S. military used wooden ships, many of which were built and anchored in Widewater, Virginia, but the war ended before they could be used. Most ships were moved across the Potomac river to a secluded bay called Mallows Bay that served as a junkyard. Some were deconstructed but most of the ships sank. In 1970 a representative from the Audubon Society testified that the wrecks had become an \\"integral part of the ecosystem.\\" In the 1990s the area was found to contain longboats from the Revolutionary era and modern ships. In 2002, Mallows Bay was protected for the state of Maryland, and in November 2015 the site was nominated as a National Marine Sanctuary.The strange voyage of the ghost fleet.The Trust for Public Land, October 28, 2015, retrieved November 21, 2015 The sunken hulls of dozens of scrapped wooden boats are still visible at low tide at Mallows Bay in the Nanjemoy area which is regarded as the \\"largest shipwreck fleet in the Western Hemisphere\\" Famous people born in Nanjemoy include Raphael Semmes, captain of the Confederate cruiser CSS Alabama, and Matthew Henson, with whom Robert Peary explored the Arctic in 1909 and with Peary may have discovered the North Pole. Wild areas Great blue herons at a nest Fossil specimens of a Turritella snail The Nanjemoy area, on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, includes the largest great blue heron (Ardea herodias) rookery in the Eastern United States north of Florida, now a preserve owned and managed by The Nature Conservancy. The area also includes Purse State Park, well known for its fossil shark teeth, Turritella snails, and other fossils of Paleocene geological age, and other protected wild areas along the Potomac River's freshwater tidal (estuarine) shore. Smallwood State Park, the Chicamuxen Wildlife Management Area, the Doncaster Demonstration Forest and Chapel Point State Park are also nearby. The Nanjemoy Creek Environmental Education Center, operated by the Charles County Public School system, is located along Nanjemoy Creek. It offers trails, a boardwalk through a freshwater tidal marsh, a pier, a pavilion, a laboratory building, and several cabins for use by school groups. An observatory there, operated by the Southern Maryland Astronomical Society, has a dome formerly used nearby at a U.S. Naval Research Laboratory facility. Recreation Hunting and fishing have long been popular in the relatively undeveloped Nanjemoy area, and many miles of remote hiking trails are available. More recently, the area's scenic, little-traveled roads have become popular with cyclists. Public boat landings are provided on the Potomac at Mallows Bay and on the estuarine portion of Nanjemoy Creek at Friendship Landing, the latter also popular for fishing. Recreational boaters, mostly from the Woodbridge and Quantico areas on the Virginia side of the Potomac, frequently visit the extensive undeveloped river shore in the Purse State Park area. Kayaking is also increasing in popularity in the area, both on the Potomac and on the quiet tidewaters of Nanjemoy Creek.

It is now part of Piscataway Park operated by the National Park Service. Marshall Hall is located near Bryans Road in Charles County, Maryland, next to the Potomac River, more or less across from Mount Vernon, Virginia, the home of George Washington. The home was one of the finest built on the Maryland shore of the Potomac in the early 18th century. The Marshall family were minor gentry and owned as many as 80 slaves by the early 19th century. Soon after the Civil War, the site became a highly frequented picnic ground because of its proximity to Mount Vernon. Steamship lines, originally established to ferry tourists from Washington D.C. and Alexandria to/from Mount Vernon, discovered a new source of revenue in the park across from the historic estate. In the 1880s, the Mount Vernon and Marshall Hall Steamboat Company ran large ships between Washington, Alexandria, Mount Vernon and Marshall Hall: the round-trip fare at that time was $1, and included admission to Mount Vernon.Owens, Trevor. Fairfax County: Postcard History Series (Arcadia Publishing: Chicago: 2010) page 12. Washingtonians fled the summer heat of the city for all sorts of events at the picnic grounds, from exclusive catered events to popular cultural events such as a swimming exhibition given by the daredevil Robert Emmet Odlum in the summer of 1878, seven years before his death at the Brooklyn Bridge. Marshall Hall later became one of the first amusement parks in the Washington, D.C., area in the 1890s, offering numerous \\"appliances of entertainment\\" (as one deed described them) for visitors who wanted to do more than picnic, many of them arriving by river boat. Starting in the 1870s,Port Tobacco Times, October 21, 1872 annual jousting tournaments took place at the site. New attractions were added throughout the 20th century, and gambling became a major draw for a while after World War II. Between 1949 and 1968, the Southern Maryland area offered the only legal slot machines in the United States outside of Nevada. The National Park Service gained control of the park after Congress, acting upon a request from the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, mandated that the views from Mt. Vernon had to be protected and returned to something resembling the days when George Washington sat on his colonnaded porch and looked across the Potomac. The term \\"historic viewshed\\" was coined for this act of preservation. The Park Service tore down all vestiges of the amusement park in 1980, whose popularity had declined due to competition by much larger, newer parks. A fire destroyed much of the colonial house soon after. In January 2003, a truck driver slammed his rig through the remaining hulk. The damage done to the brick shell was repaired the following year.

Emperor Wuzong is mainly known in modern times for the religious persecution that occurred during his reign. In addition, he was known for his successful reactions against incursions by remnants of the Huigu Khanate and the rebellion by Liu Zhen, as well as his deep trust in the chancellor Li Deyu.  Background  Li Chan was born in 814, as the ninth son of Li Heng at least,Although Emperor Wuzong was listed as Emperor Muzong's fifth son, while receiving edicts of being created princes, his name was listed after Li Cou and Li Rong, who were respectively listed as the sixth and the eighth son of Emperor Muzong; Emperor Wuzong was born in 814, later than Li Rong; When the fellows of Wang Shoucheng falsely accused Li Cou, the rumors they made suggested that Li Cou was the eldest living brother of Wenzong. So Emperor Wuzong was indeed younger than both Li Cou and Li Rong, but as the fifth living son of Emperor Muzong, he was listed as so. who was then Crown Prince under Li Chan's grandfather Emperor Xianzong. He was born at the Eastern Palace (i.e., the Crown Prince's palace). His mother was Consort Wei, whose rank was lost to history. After Li Heng became Emperor Muzong in 820, he made many of his brothers and sons princes in 821, and Li Chan was made the Prince of Ying.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241. Little is known about Li Chan's activities during the reigns of Emperor Muzong or Li Chan's older brothers Emperor Jingzong (Emperor Muzong's oldest son) and Emperor Wenzong (Emperor Muzong's second son), other than that during the middle of Emperor Wenzong's Kaicheng era (836‚Äì840), Emperor Wenzong bestowed the honorary title of Kaifu Yitong Sansi () on him, as well as the title of honorary minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu). It was said that Li Chan was silent, intelligent, and decisive, not showing his emotions easily. It was also said that Emperor Wenzong treated him and another brother, Li Rong the Prince of An, better than other princes. Emperor Wenzong originally created his son Li Yong crown prince, but after Li Yong died in 838, he was unsure whom to make his successor. Emperor Wenzong's favorite concubine Consort Yang recommended Li Rong, but when Emperor Wenzong consulted the chancellors, Li Jue opposed this proposal. Emperor Wenzong thus, in 839, created Emperor Jingzong's youngest son Li Chengmei the Prince of Chen crown prince. When Emperor Wenzong became seriously ill early in 840, he had his trusted eunuchs Liu Hongyi () and Xue Jileng () summon the chancellors Yang Sifu and Li Jue to the palace, intending to entrust Li Chengmei to them. However, the powerful eunuchs Qiu Shiliang and Yu Hongzhi (), who were not consulted in the decision, opposed Li Chengmei, and despite Li Jue's objection, forged an edict in Emperor Wenzong's name deposing Li Chengmei by claiming that Li Chengmei was too young, and creating Li Chan crown prince instead. Subsequently, Qiu and Yu had soldiers escort Li Chan from his mansion to the palace and, after Emperor Wenzong then died, persuaded Li Chan to order Consort Yang, Li Chengmei, and Li Rong all to commit suicide. After a short mourning period, Li Chan took the throne (as Emperor Wuzong).  Reign  Religious persecution Buddhism had flourished into a major religious force in China during the Tang period, and its monasteries enjoyed tax-exempt status. Because they didn't contribute taxes, Emperor Wuzong believed Buddhism to be a drain on the state's economy. Coupled with his devotion to Taoism as well and his deep trust in the Taoist monk Zhao Guizhen (), he set out to act against Buddhism, initiating an imperial edict in 842 weeding out sorcerers and convicts from the ranks of the Buddhist monks and nuns, and returning them to lay life. Monks and nuns were to turn their wealth over to the government unless they returned to lay life and paid taxes.Philip, p.123. During this first phase, Confucian arguments for the reform of Buddhist institutions and the protection of society from Buddhist influence and practices were predominant.Reischauer, p.242-243. The religious persecution reached its height in the year 845 CE, ultimately confiscating the Buddhist temple properties, destroying 4,600 Buddhist temples and 40,000 shrines, and removing 260,500 monks and nuns from the monasteries.Buddhism. (2009). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved November 26, 2009, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Library Edition Emperor Wuzong's reasons for doing so were not purely economic. A zealous Taoist, Wuzong considered Buddhism a foreign religion that was harmful to Chinese society. One notable victim of the persecution was the Japanese Tendai monk Ennin. Among its purposes were to raise war funds and to cleanse China of foreign influences. As such, the persecution was directed not only towards Buddhism but also towards other foreign religions, such as Zoroastrianism, Nestorian Christianity, and Manichaeism. Only the native Chinese ideologies of Confucianism and Taoism survived the upheaval relatively unaffected. He all but destroyed Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in China, and his persecution of the growing Nestorian Christian churches sent Chinese Christianity into a decline from which it never recovered. At the same time, Wuzong went far to promote Taoist worship in China through religious regulations and the construction of the Temple for Viewing Immortals in the Imperial court. (Emperor Wuzong was one of the last Tang emperors and ruled China during a long period of decline; despite his reforms, he was unable to revive the empire through his religious persecutions. After his death, with the help of his uncle Emperor XuƒÅnzong, Buddhism was able to recover from the persecution; but Christianity, Manichaeism, and Zoroastrianism never again played as significant a role in Chinese religious life.)  Dealing with the Huigu incursions  By the time that Emperor Wuzong took the throne, his mother Consort Wei had already died, and he posthumously honored her as an empress dowager. Also, knowing that Yang Sifu and Li Jue had not supported him as Emperor Wenzong's successor, he had them removed from their offices. He instead installed Li Deyu, former chancellor under Wenzong, as a chancellor and effectively put most of the responsibilities of governance in his hands. (In 841, Emperor Wuzong further ordered Liu Hongyi and Xue Jileng to commit suicide and planned to order Yang and Li Jue to do so as well, but Yang and Li Jue were spared (and only demoted) after the intercession by Li Deyu and the other chancellors, Cui Gong, Cui Dan, and Chen Yixing.) One of the first things that Emperor Wuzong had to deal with was the collapse of Tang's erstwhile vassal and ally Huigu‚Äîwhich had supported Tang in various campaigns through the decades. In 840, due to internal power struggles, Huigu was weakened, such that when the Xiajiasi (Kirghiz) khan Are () attacked, the Huigu khan Yaoluoge Hesa () was killed. The Huigu tribespeople scattered, fleeing in various directions. One major group, under the leadership of the prince Wamosi and the nobles Chixin (), Pugu (), and Najiachuo (), headed for the Tang border city of Tiande (Â§©Âæ∑, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia) and sought to submit to Tang. The leader of another major group, the noble Yaoluoge Wuxi, claimed the khan title for himself (as Wujie Khan). Wujie Khan subsequently seized Emperor Wuzong's aunt Princess Taihe, who had married a previous khan (Chongde Khan), and held her hostage. Various Huigu remnants pillaged the Tang border regions, causing much disturbance for the Tang people. At Li Deyu's suggestion, Emperor Wuzong supplied food to the Huigu remnants to try to calm them, while accepting Wamosi's submission. When Wujie Khan subsequently demanded that Tang turn Wamosi over to him as a traitor, Emperor Wuzong refused. Subsequently, Wujie Khan's forces and Tang's border defense forces came into open combat, even though both sides continued negotiations. In 843, the Tang general Liu Mian () launched a surprise attack against Wujie Khan, led by his officer Shi Xiong. Shi crushed Wujie Khan's forces and rescued Princess Taihe. Wujie Khan fled, and subsequently, the Huigu remnants created only minor nuisances for Tang and no longer posed a major threat.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 247.  The Zhaoyi campaign  Immediately after the dissipation of the Huigu threat, however, Emperor Wuzong faced a crisis of a different kind. In 843, Liu Congjian the military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), who had governed Zhaoyi in de facto independence from the imperial government and who had a strident rivalry with Qiu Shiliang, was seriously ill, and Liu wanted his adoptive son (and biological nephew) Liu Zhen to succeed him, and set up the power structure at the circuit to facilitate the transition. He submitted petitions requesting that Liu Zhen be allowed to take over the circuit. When Liu Congjian thereafter died, Liu Zhen sought to inherit the circuit. Li Deyu, believing that this would be a prime opportunity for the imperial government to seize control of Zhaoyi Circuit, advocated a campaign against Liu Zhen, and Emperor Wuzong agreed. Initially, the imperial government was concerned that three other de facto independent circuits north of the Yellow River (Weibo (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), then governed by He Hongjing; Chengde (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), then governed by Wang Yuankui; and Lulong (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing, then governed by Zhang Zhongwu) would side with Zhaoyi. Emperor Wuzong secured their cooperation by effectively promising the three circuits that he would not interfere with their independence, and in fact secured the military cooperation of both Weibo and Chengde in the campaign against Zhaoyi by leaving the task of capturing Zhaoyi's three eastern prefectures, east of the Taihang Mountains, to Wang and He Hongjing. The other imperial generals, including Wang Zai, Shi Xiong, and Liu Mian, concentrated on Zhaoyi's two western prefectures, including its capital Lu Prefecture (). Initially, the imperial forces could not advance well against Zhaoyi forces, and the campaign was complicated by a mutiny by the officer Yang Bian () at Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) early in 844. Yang's mutiny was quickly put down, however, and the imperial forces continued their assault on Zhaoyi. In fall 844, the three eastern prefectures surrendered to He Hongjing and Wang Yuankui, and soon thereafter, Liu Zhen was killed by his own officer Guo Yi (), who then surrendered.  After the Zhaoyi campaign  After the Zhaoyi campaign, Li Deyu used the opportunity to carry reprisals against his political enemies in the Niu-Li Factional Struggles‚Äîthose who were members of what would later be referred to as the Niu Faction (named after Niu Sengru) against Li Deyu's Li Faction‚Äîincluding the former chancellors Niu Sengru and Li Zongmin‚Äîby accusing them of complicity in Liu Zhen's rebellion. As a result, Niu and Li Zongmin were exiled to remote regions. In 845, Emperor Wuzong wanted to create his favorite concubine, Consort Wang, empress. Li Deyu, pointing out that Consort Wang was of low birth and that she was sonless, opposed. Emperor Wuzong therefore did not do so. (Emperor Wuzong had five known sons, but very little is known about them other than their names and their princely titles.)Old Book of Tang, vol. 175. Late in Emperor Wuzong's life, he began taking pills made by Taoist alchemists, which were intended to lead to immortality, and it was said that his mood became harsh and unpredictable as a side effect. By late 845, he was seriously ill. In early 846, in an attempt to ward off the illness, he changed his name to Li Yan‚Äîunder the theory that under the Wu Xing cosmology, his original name of Chan () contained two instances of earth () while only containing one instance of water (), which meant that he was getting suppressed by the dynasty's own spirits (as Tang beliefs included that the dynasty was protected by earth), while Yan () contained two instances of fire (), which was more harmonious with earth. Despite this change, his conditions did not get better. The eunuchs, believing that Emperor Wuzong's uncle Li Yi the Prince of Guang to be simple-minded, decided to make him Emperor Wuzong's successor; they therefore had an edict issued in Emperor Wuzong's name creating Li Yi crown prince (and changing Li Yi's name to Li Chen). Soon thereafter, Emperor Wuzong died, and Li Chen took the throne as Emperor XuƒÅnzong.

Skylink Technologies, Inc., 381 F.3d 1178 (Fed. Cir. 2004)The Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Skylink Technologies, Inc., 381 F.3d 1178 (Fed. Cir. 2004). is a legal case heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concerning the anti-trafficking provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), , in the context of two competing universal garage door opener companies. It discusses the statutory structure and legislative history of the DMCA to help clarify the intent of the anti- circumvention provisions and decide who holds the burden of proof. It expresses that the statute creates a cause of action for liability and does not create a property right, and holds that as Chamberlain had alleged that Skylink was in violation of the anti-trafficking provision, it had the burden to prove and failed to show that access was unauthorized and its rights were infringed under the Copyright Act. As Chamberlain incorrectly argued that Skylink had the burden of proof and failed to prove their claim, the court upheld summary judgment in favor of Skylink.  Background of the case  This case involves two competitors that produce universal garage door openers (GDOs). Universal garage door openers are used when people want to replace or purchase a spare transmitter to open their garage door. They are designed to interoperate with existing GDO systems, regardless of model. Chamberlain markets a \\"Security+\\" line of GDOs which includes rolling code software that actively alters the transmitted signal by cycling through a series of strings (of which only some are able to open the door). This rolling code is designed to protect against a potential \\"code grabbing\\" attack where a nearby burglar may try to record the garage door opening signal. Chamberlain claims that the rolling code system makes it unlikely for a burglar to send a valid signal by replaying the recorded one. With rolling code protection, a garage door will open if and only if the transmitted code is not among the last 1024 used codes and it is among the next 4096 codes. The Security+ has additional functionality that will cause the GDO to resynchronize when two signals out of the acceptable range are transmitted in rapid succession. This was added in the case that homeowners use the same transmitter on multiple garage doors. In 1992, Skylink produced a universal transmitter called Model 39 that was designed to work for both rolling code and non-rolling code GDOs. The Model 39 bypasses the Chamberlain's rolling code system by imitating Security+'s resynchronization feature. The Model 39 transmitter sends three fixed codes in rapid succession; this either causes the door to open due to the first code or it causes the door to resynchronize and open due to the latter two codes. Relevant law This case involves the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA. 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 1201(b) states: > No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or > otherwise traffic in any technology, product, service, device, component, or > part thereof, that‚Äî (A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of > circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a > work protected under this title;.  Procedural history  Chamberlain sued Skylink in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in two cases. In the first case, Chamberlain I, Chamberlain alleged that Skylink's actions violated the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA and moved for summary judgment. The court denied Chamberlain's motion for summary judgment. In the second case, Chamberlain II, Chamberlain alleged that Skylink infringed their patents and violated the anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA. With regards to the DMCA claim in Chamberlain II, Chamberlain contended that: #Model 39 was designed to circumvent the protection mechanism placed by Chamberlain's rolling code (infringing ¬ß1201(a)(2)(A)). #It has limited commercial use other than to circumvent the rolling code (infringing ¬ß1201(a)(2)(B)). #It was marketed to circumvent that technology (infringing ¬ß1201(a)(2)(C)). In response, Skylink claimed that \\"consumers use the Model 39 transmitter to activate the Security+ GDOs with Chamberlain's consent.\\" ¬ß1201(a)(3)(A) states that to \\"circumvent a technological measure\\" means to \\"descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner.\\" They also claimed that the Model 39 transmitter served a variety of functions that were unrelated to circumvention, that Chamberlain had failed to demonstrate that its GDOs contained a computer program protected by copyright, that Skylink had not violated the DMCA because its acts fell within a safe harbor provision per ¬ß1201(f), and that Chamberlain's rolling code computer program did not protect a copyrighted computer program, but instead protects an uncopyrightable process. Chamberlain claimed that (1) Skylink had the burden to prove that their use was authorized and (2) Chamberlain \\"never gave consumers explicit authorization to program competing universal transmitters into its rolling code openers.\\" The District Court agreed with Skylink and because Chamberlain did not explicitly restrict the consumer's use of alternate transmitters, this was deemed an unconditional sale that implicitly authorized customers to use other transmitters. The court also noted that Chamberlain's construction and interpretation of the DMCA would make its own consumers violate ¬ß1201(a)(1), which prohibits circumvention of a technological measure that controls access. As Chamberlain did not show that Skylink's access was unauthorized, the District Court granted the motion for summary judgment to Skylink and dismissed the patent claims. Appeal issues Chamberlain appealed the District Court's decision of summary judgment granted to Skylink in Chamberlain II and the case was heard before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In this case, Chamberlain claimed the District Court incorrectly placed the burden on Chamberlain to prove that the circumvention of its technological measures was unauthorized when it should have placed the burden on Skylink to show that the use was authorized. Decision The Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling. The court explained that by explicitly stating that circumvention occurs \\"without the authority of the copyright owner,\\" the DMCA requires the plaintiff alleging circumvention to show that the defendant's access was unauthorized. The Federal Circuit went on to clarify the nature of the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions. The DMCA established causes of action for liability and did not establish a property right. Therefore, circumvention is not infringement in itself. In response to Chamberlain's assertions that the DMCA \\"renders the pre-DMCA history in the GDO industry irrelevant,\\" \\"fundamentally altered the legal landscape,\\" and \\"overrode all pre-existing consumer expectations about the legitimate uses of products containing copyrighted embedded software,\\" the court disagreed. In Chamberlain's view, all use of products that contain copyrighted software and use protective technological measures would violate the DMCA and this would give companies a loophole around antitrust laws as well as take away the fair use defense.EFF, Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Skylink Technologies, Inc. . By examining the structure and history of the statute and the intent of Congress, the court attempted to interpret the statutory language. The court found that the goals of the DMCA were to establish a balance between the competing interests of content owners and information users and balance access control measures with fair use. Chamberlain had the burden to prove that (1) they had ownership of a copyrighted work, (2) it was controlled by a technological measure that was circumvented, (3) third parties can access it (4) without authorization in a way that (5) infringes rights protected by the Copyright Act due to a product created, advertised, or provided by the defendant Skylink. Once the plaintiff proves those five they must also prove that the defendant trafficked in a product which was (i) designed or produced primarily for circumvention; (ii) made available despite only limited commercial significance other than circumvention; or (iii) marketed for use in circumvention of the controlling technological measure. Chamberlain never claimed that Skylink infringed its copyrights or contributed to third-party infringement nor did it show that its users were unauthorized to use the product. As Chamberlain failed to show the fourth and fifth requirements to prove their claim, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's grant of summary judgment to Skylink, writing, > Chamberlain, however, has failed to show not only the requisite lack of > authorization, but also the necessary fifth element of its claim, the > critical nexus between access and protection. Chamberlain neither alleged > copyright infringement nor explained how the access provided by the Model 39 > transmitter facilitates the infringement of any right that the Copyright Act > protects. There can therefore be no reasonable relationship between the > access that homeowners gain to Chamberlain's copyrighted software when using > Skylink's Model 39 transmitter and the protections that the Copyright Act > grants to Chamberlain.

She was the last American survivor, and also the last survivor with actual memories of the disaster.AP. \\"Titanic ticket belonging to last U.S. survivor auctioned\\", Daily News (New York). April 19, 2008. Early life Lillian Asplund was born on October 21, 1906 in Worcester, Massachusetts, to Carl and Selma (n√©e Johansson) Asplund, both immigrants from Sweden. Her parents had lived briefly in Missouri prior to settling in Worcester. Lillian had a twin brother, Carl, and two older brothers, Filip, born in 1898, and Clarence, born in 1902. In 1907, the family received word that Lillian's paternal grandfather had died back in Sweden. As her father was the executor of his estate, the family made arrangements to return to Sweden to settle the estate of the family farm, located near the village of Alseda in Sm√•land. Lillian, her parents and three brothers sailed from Boston aboard the Cunard Line's Ivernia, arriving in Liverpool on July 4 from where they proceeded to Gothenburg before arriving at Alseda.Microfilm images from archives of UK-bound passenger lists, accessed through Ancestry.com The family remained at Alseda for the following 4 3/4 years while settling matters with the farm and caring for Lillian's grandmother, during which time Selma gave birth to another son, Felix, in March 1909. By early 1912, the family was ready to return home to Worcester, and Lillian's father booked passage for his family on the new White Star Liner Titanic. Aboard Titanic Lillian, her parents, and four brothers boarded Titanic at Southampton, England on April 10, 1912 as third-class passengers. Lillian was five years old at the time and recalled that the ship \\"was very big, and it had just been painted. I remember not liking the smell of fresh paint.\\" When Titanic struck the iceberg at 11:40 pm on the night of April 14, 1912, Lillian's father woke his sleeping family and then put all important papers, including cash, into his pocket. Lillian, her mother, and brother Felix were loaded into Lifeboat No. 15. Lillian later recalled, \\"my mother said she would rather stay with him [my father] and go down with the ship, but he said the children should not be alone. [My mother] had Felix on her lap and she had me between her knees. I think she thought she could keep me a little warmer that way.\\" She later described the ship sinking as a big building going down and that she was haunted by the memory of the faces of her father and brothers at the railing of the ship while the life boat was launched. Lillian, her mother and brother were rescued by , which had arrived at the scene shortly after four o'clock in the morning. Lillian and her brother were loaded into burlap bags and hoisted to the ship's deck. Aboard the Carpathia, Lillian remembered: > A woman took all my clothes off me. My clothes had gotten very dirty and wet > in the lifeboat. My mother was trying to find me. She was saying, 'I have a > daughter!' Well, she found me. And eventually my clothes were dry, and I put > them back on. They took us, the children, to the place where they take > people who are sick. Well, not sick, but people who needed a little more > attention. The people on the Carpathia were very good to us.\\" Carpathia arrived in New York City on April 18. Lillian's mother took her and her brother to Worcester shortly thereafter. Lillian's father and brothers Filip, Clarence and Carl perished in the sinking. In the confusion after the disaster, a Worcester newspaper reported that both Mr. and Mrs. Asplund had been saved, along with Clarence, Lillian and Felix, and that Filip and Carl had drowned. A later report said that Selma and her \\"two babies\\" had been taken to a local hospital, and that Mr. Asplund and Clarence were apparently at another location. A final report confirmed that neither Carl, Sr. nor Clarence were among the survivors. Carl, Sr.'s body was recovered by CS Mackay-Bennett and was later buried in All Faiths Cemetery in Worcester. As the families savings and possessions were lost in the disaster, a fundraiser and benefit was held by the city of Worcester, which brought in $2,000 (). Later life Lillian's mother never recovered from the loss of her husband and three eldest sons, and refused to discuss the disaster with anyone, saying that it was simply wrong to do so. Lillian agreed and, for the rest of her life, hardly ever spoke of the disaster. According to her lawyer, when asked about why she refused interviews even when offered money, Asplund stated; \\"Why do I want money from the Titanic? Look what I lost. A father and three brothers.\\" She worked secretarial jobs in the Worcester area, and retired early to care for her mother. Selma died on April 15, 1964, the 52nd anniversary of the sinking, at the age of 90. Her brother Felix, who never married and with whom Lillian lived, died of pneumonia on March 15, 1983 at the age of 73. Death Lillian died in her home in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, on May 6, 2006 at the age of 99. She was buried at the Old Swedish Cemetery in Worcester, alongside her father, mother, and brother. Her death left Barbara West and Millvina Dean as the last two living survivors. However, as both women were less than a year old at the time, neither had any recollection of the sinking. With Lillian being the last survivor who remembered the sinking, first-hand accounts of the RMS Titanic passed into history upon her death. After her death, the steamship ticket she had held for so many years was sold at auction in 2009. It was a part of documents and items that were found in a safety deposit box after her death, that were connected to the disaster such as her father's pocket watch that stopped at 2:19 am.

Then the domain name applicant can ask the registrar to manage his domain name or have it managed directly by the DK Hostmaster. Registrations of domain names with the characters √¶, √∏, √•, √∂, √§, √º, and √© are also allowed. History The country code top-level domain .dk was created July 14, 1987, at ARPA Network Information Center, Stanford Research Institute (SRI-NIC). The Danish UNIX User Group (DKUUG) at Datalogisk Institut, K√∏benhavns Universitet (DIKU) received management of the .dk domain on the DKnet, at that time an informal name used for the UUCP network used at DIKU and other places in Denmark. The name DKnet has been in use since at least 1985. In mid-1988 DKnet was connected to the emerging DENet, the government-sponsored research network established in late 1987 now known as forskningsnettet, run and maintained by UNI-C. In November 1987 DKUUG made a name agreement (\\"navneaftalen\\") with the coordinators of the three other networks then working in Denmark, a national experimental X.400 net (EAN from University of British Columbia), EARN and DECnet, concerning the .dk domain. They agreed to share it, hiding from the users which network they were connected to, and nullifying the use of pseudo- domains like .uucp or second-level domains like gov.uk, thereby creating a practice that has been enforced ever since, and also applied in other countries. By early 1992 UNI-C via DENet (an acronym for \\"Danish Educational Network\\") serviced all the Universities in Denmark, and DIKU had no need for DKnet anymore. Thus DKUUG, with DKnet, moved to Symbion Science Park where they received their own international lines and started to lease these to companies, and modem connections to private consumers. The growing business quickly overshadowed the organization's own economy, forcing the creation of a separate company. In 1993, DKnet ApS, a genuine ISP and Denmark's first, was established as a limited liability company (ApS). In 1996, with the establishment of the Danish Research Network, the name \\"DENet\\" was used for the commercial part of the network and changed to be an acronym for \\"Dansk Erhvervs Net\\", i.e. Danish Business Network. Tele Danmark takes over On February 15, 1996, DKnet ApS, including the .dk domain management, was sold by DKUUG to Tele Danmark (now TDC) at the price of 20 million DKK. Acknowledging the possible conflict of interest of a company (Tele Denmark) behind both a commercial ISP (DKnet A/S, now a stock company) and also in control of the .dk domain management (DK Hostmaster), a group of tele- and internet companies, 28 in all, including TeliaSonera, Global One, Deutsche Telekom, IBM, assembled five days after the purchase in order to gain control of the DK Hostmaster function. Tele Danmark initially refused, and the group together formed the organisation Foreningen af Internetleverand√∏rer (FIL), and threatened to go directly to IANA to counter what they saw as a bona fide Tele Danmark monopoly. Tele Denmark agreed and FIL became the authority registered by IANA for the .dk domain, while the nominal and practical administration remained the responsibility of DKnet A/S. In June 1996 they signed a one-year contract about the practice and rules concerning the .dk domain, which would later be renewed for another year. Race for the .dk domain On January 15, 1997, at 15.00, FIL loosened the restrictions for registering a .dk domain name. Where one had previously needed a valid reason to register one, all restrictions were now removed, creating an unprecedented run on .dk domain names. By the end of 1996 there were only 6.500 registered .dk domains, by February 1, 1997, this had more than doubled and at the end of 1997 there were 41.000 registered .dk domains. This in turn created a series of legal actions, which would last well into the 2000s, not only against FIL's own members, who were accused of using inside knowledge to register large amount of \\"good\\" domain names quickly, but also against individuals who were accused of cyber squatting. In December 1997 Tele Danmark announced that from the beginning of 1998 they would start collecting a yearly fee (of 340 DKK excluding VAT) for every registered domain name via DK Hostmaster. This caused a stir in FIL's members, as they had not been informed. While there had been talks about some sort of fee to DK Hostmaster to cover its expenses, no review of DK Hostmaster's actual budget was available since it was financially all but a part of Tele Danmark. This was therefore seen by FIL as abuse of power and profit making via the supposedly non-profit DK Hostmaster organization. It was later revealed that it was the board of directors of FIL (later fired) that had granted Tele Danmark the right to set the price that they wanted, without asking its members. As a consequence of this, Tele Danmark announced in March 1998 that the commercial parts in DKnet A/S would be moved to Tele Denmark Internet and DKnet A/S, with its only remaining asset, DK Hostmaster, would be renamed to \\"DK Hostmaster A/S\\", and put up for sale. Tele Danmark encouraged a larger forum or group comprising more than just telecom and internet companies (like FIL) to form and buy it, because the Internet now had a much broader appeal. This caused yet another stir in FIL who flat-out rejected that Tele Denmark had the right to sell something it did not own. DIFO takes over In October 1998 FIL sent a letter to Tele Danmark ending the contract and agreement that had been signed back in June 1996 (renewed in 1997). The letter also stated that FIL wanted to take over the running of DK Hostmaster themselves. Tele Danmark denied that FIL could do this. In November 1998 FIL, on the invitation of the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, called a meeting between all actors on the Danish internet, companies as well as users, under the banner \\"ID MoU\\" (\\"Internet Danmark Memorandum of Understanding\\") in order to establish a long-term agreement on the administration of the .dk domain. The result of \\"ID MoU\\" was that a number of institutions and organizations established a self-owning institution named Dansk INTERNET Forum (DIFO) on July 1, 1999, which with the help of external investment bought \\"DK Hostmaster A/S\\" in December 1999. IPv6 DK Hostmaster has offered IPv6 glue records for second-level domains since April 4, 2008, when the first DNS provider had IPv6 glue records added in the TLD. IPv6 was enabled at the transport layer to TLD nameservers a few years prior to that. Just days prior to the World IPv6 day, DK Hostmaster added an IPv6 address in DNS for their web server and that of the web server of its owner, DIFO. DNSSEC After the DNS root zone was signed in mid-July 2010, the .DK-zone was officially signed using NSEC3 on July 23, 2010, and the root zone was updated July 26, 2010, to include the corresponding DS-record. Since August 1, 2010, customers' DS-records have been included in the DK-zone. Second level domains In general most companies and people register their desired domain name at the second level, e.g. company.dk and lastname.dk. Third level domains Third level domains are allocated by second level domain owners. The registry does not run, recommend nor endorse any general second level domains, such as .com.dk, for third parties, and they are generally not seen. Oldest .dk domains The oldest .dk domains still registered in DK Hostmaster's database, are the domains dkuug.dk, diku.dk, bk.dk, ibt.dk, ifad.dk, lego.dk, mainz.dk and nordita.dk which were all registered in 1987 when .dk was registered. With the registration of .dk a dual naming with both .uucp and .dk names was introduced. Of these, diku.dk and ibt.dk can be said to be the oldest names, as these were the initial names on the Danish UUCP network started 2 January 1983.

The National Park Service preserves the site and interprets the history of the Valley Forge encampment. Originally Valley Forge State Park, it became a national historical park in 1976. The park contains historical buildings, recreated encampment structures, memorials, museums, and recreation facilities. The park encompasses and is visited by over 1.2 million people each year. Visitors can see restored historic structures, reconstructed structures such as the iconic log huts, and monuments erected by the states from which the Continental soldiers came. Visitor facilities include a visitor center and museum featuring original artifacts, providing a concise introduction to the American Revolution and the Valley Forge encampment. Ranger programs, tours (walking and trolley), and activities are available seasonally. The park also provides of hiking and biking trails, which are connected to a robust regional trails system. Wildlife watching, fishing, and boating on the nearby Schuylkill River also are popular. Historical encampment Lafayette From December 19, 1777 to June 19, 1778, the main body of the Continental Army (approximately 12,000 troops) was encamped at Valley Forge. The site was chosen because it was between the seat of the Second Continental Congress in York, supply depots in Reading, and British forces in Philadelphia away, which fell after the Battle of Brandywine, in which many American soldiers were injured, including the Marquis de Lafayette This was a time of great suffering for the army, but it was also a time of retraining and rejuvenation. The shared hardship of the officers and soldiers of the army, combined with Baron Friedrich von Steuben's professional military training program, are considered key to the subsequent success of the Continental Army and marks a turning point in the Revolutionary War. Park history Valley Forge was established as the first state park of Pennsylvania in 1893 by the Valley Forge Park Commission (VFPC) \\"to preserve, improve, and maintain as a public park the site on which General George Washington's army encamped at Valley Forge.\\". The area around Washington's Headquarters was chosen as the park site. In 1923, the VFPC was brought under the Department of Forests and Waters and later incorporated into the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 1971. The park served as the location of the National Scout Jamboree in 1950, 1957, and 1964. Valley Forge was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1961 and was listed in the initial National Register of Historic Places in 1966. and The area covered by these listings goes outside what was the Valley Forge State Park boundaries to include four historic houses where the Marquis de Lafayette and other officers were quartered. In 1976, Pennsylvania gave the park as a gift to the nation for the Bicentennial. The U.S. Congress passed a law signed by President Gerald Ford on July 4, 1976, authorizing the addition of Valley Forge National Historical Park as the 283rd Unit of the National Park System.Valley Forge National Historical Park - Washington Memorial Chapel (U.S. National Park Service) In addition to establishing Valley Forge National Park, the law also allocated an initial budget of $8,622,000 and an additional $500,000 for essential facilities.

The Mid-Atlantic Region included five states: Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. This changed in 1995 when the North Atlantic Region merged with the Mid-Atlantic Region to create the Northeast Region. Features and facilities Visitor center Ranger in Continental Army uniform explaining Revolutionary War artillery. Visitor Center The park's visitor center includes a museum with artifacts found during excavations of the park, an interactive muster roll of Continental soldiers encamped at Valley Forge, ranger-led gallery programs and walks, a storytelling program, a photo gallery, a visitor information desk, and a store for books and souvenirs. 90-minute bus tours of the park and bike rentals are available seasonally. A short 18-minute film, \\"Valley Forge: A Winter Encampment\\" is shown in the park's theater next door. The visitor center, built in 1976, was undergoing renovations, and visitor center operations have moved to a temporary visitor center, located in the parking lot of the existing facility. The newly remodeled visitor center was expected to reopen in late spring 2020. Headquarters buildings Washington's Headquarters A key attraction of the park is the restored colonial home used by General George Washington as his headquarters during the encampment. Rehabilitation of the headquarters area was completed in summer 2009, and included the restoration of the old Valley Forge train station into an information center, new guided tours, new exhibits throughout the landscape, and the elimination of several acres of modern paving and restoration of the historic landscape. Quarters of other Continental Army generals are also in the park, including those of Huntington, Varnum, Lord Stirling, Lafayette, and Knox. Varnum's quarters is open on weekends during the summer. Reconstructed works and buildings Recreation of a cabin in which soldiers would have lived at Valley Forge Throughout the park there are reconstructed log cabins of the type thought to be used during the encampment. Earthworks for the defense of the encampment are visible, including four redoubts, the ditch for the Inner Line Defenses, and a reconstructed abatis. The original redoubts and several redans on Route 23, Outer Line Drive, and Inner Line Drive were covered with sod to preserve them, but they are currently in need of further restoration. The original forges, located on Valley Creek, were burned by the British three months prior to Washington's occupation of the park area. However, neither the Upper Forge site nor the Lower Forge site has been reconstructed. There are also several historical buildings that have not been made open to the public because of reasons such as their current state of disrepair. These include: Lord Stirling's Quarters, Knox's Quarters, and the Von Steuben Memorial. Other historical buildings include the P.C. Knox Estate, Kennedy-Supplee Mansion and Potts' Barn. Washington Memorial Chapel The Washington Memorial Chapel and National Patriots Bell Tower carillon sit atop a hill at the center of the present park. The chapel is the legacy of Rev. Dr. W. Herbert Burk. Inspired by Burk's 1903 sermon on Washington's birthday, the chapel is a functioning Episcopal Church, built as a tribute to Washington. Burk was also instrumental in the development of the park, including obtaining Washington's campaign tent and banner, which used to be on display in the visitor center but is now in the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. The chapel and attached bell tower are not technically part of the park but serve the spiritual needs of the park and the community that surround it. The bell tower houses the Daughters of the American Revolution Patriot Rolls, listing those that served in the Revolutionary War, and the chapel grounds hosted the World of Scouting Museum.World of Scouting Museum Memorial markers The National Memorial Arch Sitting atop a hill at the intersection of the Outer Line of Defense with the Gulph Road, the National Memorial Arch dominates the southern portion of the park. It is dedicated \\"to the officers and private soldiers of the Continental Army December 19, 1777 ‚Äì June 19, 1778.\\" The arch was commissioned by an act of the 61st Congress in 1910 and completed in 1917. It is inscribed with George Washington's tribute to the perseverance and endurance of his army: The drive is lined with large (~2 m high) memorial stones for each of the brigades, or \\"lines\\", that encamped there. Crossing Gulph Road at the arch, the drive proceeds through the Pennsylvania Columns and past the hilltop statue of Anthony Wayne on horse. More brigade stones line Port Kennedy Road. Mount Joy Observation Tower Mount Joy Observation Tower Atop Mount Joy, the highest elevation in the main park area, stood a steel observation tower. The tower was closed in the 1980s because of deterioration, liability concerns, and the surrounding trees outgrowing the platform. The tower was removed and shipped to a private area near Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, where people can still climb it. The area where it stood is now only accessible by foot trail, the roads have been removed and the area is being given back to the woods. Trails Welcome sign on the thumb There are of hiking and biking trails within the park, such as the Valley Creek Trail and the River Trail. The main trail is the Joseph Plumb Martin Trail, which encircles 8.7 miles of the park. Portions of regional trails, including the Horse Shoe Trail and the Schuylkill River Trail, also run through the park. Recreation The many trails in Valley Forge allow for different activities such as jogging, walking and biking. Other activities include horseback riding and canoeing/kayaking. There are three picnic areas located on the site. In addition, Park Rangers dressed in period uniforms are stationed as the Muhlenburg Brigade Huts and Washington's Headquarters, ready to inform visitors about the historic events that happened on the site. The Valley Forge 5-Mile Revolutionary Run is also held in the park every April. Train station Near Washington's Headquarters is the Valley Forge Train Station, owned by the park. The station was completed in 1911 by the Reading Railroad and was the point of entry to the park for travelers who came by rail through the 1950s from Philadelphia, distant.Official Guide of the Railways. New York: National Railway Publication Co., February, 1956. The station was restored in 2009 and is used as a museum and information center that offers visitors a better understanding of Washington's Headquarters and the village of Valley Forge. Constructed of the same type of stone as Washington's Headquarters, the building was erected on a large man-made embankment overlooking the headquarters site. Near the visitor center is another station at Port Kennedy, on the same line. Also owned by the park, the station, both platforms and the former parking area are in a state of disrepair.Train Station Modern problems Open field in the park As a park in an increasingly urbanized area, Valley Forge faces problems including traffic, urban sprawl, and an overpopulation of white-tailed deer. Valley Forge Park Road (PA Route 23), a heavily traveled two-lane commuter road, passes through the park and carries about six million vehicles per year of mostly commuter traffic. Efforts to divert the traffic have thus far been unsuccessful, owing to existing traffic volume on alternate routes. A consortium of local governments and state and federal agencies are working on approaches to traffic congestion throughout the area, particularly improvements to US 422. In 2001, a privately held tract of land within the authorized park boundaries was offered for sale. When the Park Service was unable to purchase it, it was sold to Toll Brothers, a real estate development company, for $2.5 million. It took a grass roots campaign to get the Federal Government to purchase the land from the developer two years later, for $7.5 million. In 2007, a non-profit organization ‚Äì the American Revolution Center ‚Äì purchased of land within the park boundary with plans to construct a conference center, hotel, retail, campground and museum on the site.http://www.philly.com/inquirer/opinion/pa/20080215_Keep_Valley_Forge_sacred.html The National Parks Conservation Association and local citizens sued Lower Providence Township over the zoning change that enabled this proposal. The two parties agreed to allow NPS to keep the land, and in exchange, the American Revolution Center was given property in Philadelphia, where it built the Museum of the American Revolution. An overpopulation of white-tailed deer has resulted in \\"changes in the species composition, abundance, and distribution of native plant communities and associated wildlife\\" in the park. In 2008, the National Park Service released a draft deer management plan and environmental impact statement for public review. The intent of the controversial plan was to \\"support long-term protection, preservation, and restoration of native vegetation and other natural resources within the park.\\" Hunting is expressly prohibited by the legislation that created the park, and action by Congress would be required before it could be sanctioned. Since the plan was put into place, natural habitats have been restored and vegetation not seen in the park for decades has begun to return. The park includes the site of the Ehret Magnesia Company, a former manufacturer of asbestos-insulated pipes. Pre- existing dolomite quarries were subsequently backfilled with asbestos- containing slurry waste materials. Those areas of the park are closed to visitors, and an effort is underway at permanent remediation.

The May Queen is a girl who rides or walks at the front of a parade for May Day celebrations. She wears a white gown to symbolise purity and usually a tiara or crown. Her duty is to begin the May Day celebrations. She is generally crowned by flowers and makes a speech before the dancing begins. Certain age-groups dance around a Maypole celebrating youth and springtime. History James George Frazer speculated that the figure of the May Queen was linked to ancient tree worship.Frazer (1922), The Golden Bough, ch. 10 \\"Relics of tree worship in modern Europe\\"; Frazer quotes Mannhardt: \\"The names May, Father May, May Lady, Queen of the May, by which the anthropomorphic spirit of vegetation is often denoted, show that the idea of the spirit of vegetation is blent with a personification of the season at which his powers are most strikingly manifested.\\" In the High Middle Ages in England the May Queen was also known as the \\"Summer Queen\\".

In 1557, a London diarist called Henry Machyn wrote: > \\"The xxx day of May was a goly May-gam in Fanch-chyrchestrett with drumes > and gunes and pykes, and ix wordes dyd ryd; and thay had speches evere man, > and the morris dansse and the sauden, and an elevant with the castyll, and > the sauden and yonge morens with targattes and darttes, and the lord and the > lade of the Maye\\". Modern English: On the 30 May was a jolly May-game in Fenchurch Street (London) with drums and guns and pikes, The Nine Worthies did ride; and they all had speeches, and the morris dance and sultan and an elephant with a castle and the sultan and young moors with shields and arrows, and the lord and lady of the May\\".Nichols, J. G. (ed). (1848). The Diary of Henry Machyn: Citizen and Merchant-Taylor of London (1550-1563). Retrieved 11 February 2007. Maintaining the tradition right Many areas keep this tradition alive today. The oldest unbroken tradition is Hayfield, Derbyshire,Hayfield.uk.net based on a much older May Fair. Another notable event includes the one in the Brentham Garden Suburb, England, which hosts it annually. It has the second oldest unbroken tradition although the May Queen of All London Festival at Hayes Common in Bromley is a close contender having been in existence for 105 years as of 2017. A May Day festival is held on the village green at Aldborough, North Yorkshire on a site that dates back to Roman times and the settlement of Isurium Brigantum. A May queen is selected from a group of 13 upward girls by the young dancers. She returns the next year to crown the new May Queen and stays in the procession. The largest event in this tradition in modern Britain is the Beltane Fire Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland. A May Day celebration held annually since 1870 in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada, has the distinction of being the longest running May Day celebration of its kind in the British Commonwealth. Related personifications Male companions to the May Queen, sometimes associated with May Day customs in Great Britain, include personifications known as Father May, King of the May, May King, Garland King, Green Man, or Jack in the Green. As part of this folk custom, some villages would choose a man to act as consort for the May Queen. This man, the May King, would dress in greenery to symbolise springtime.

This particular marmot species is large compared to some other marmots, and most other rodents. Marmots as a group are the largest members of the squirrel family, with weights of adults varying from 3 to 7 kg depending on age and time of year.Barash D.P. 1989. Marmots: social behavior and ecology. Stanford University Press, Stanford Although endemic to Vancouver Island, Marmota vancouverensis now also resides successfully at several captive breeding centres across Canada as well as several sites on Vancouver Island at which local extinction was observed during the 1990s. This is the result of an ongoing recovery program designed to prevent extinction and restore self- sustaining wild populations of this unique Canadian species. Due to the efforts of the recovery program, the marmot count in the wild increased from less than 30 wild marmots in 2003, to an estimated 250‚Äì300 in 2015.  Description  Vancouver Island marmot skull The Vancouver Island marmot is typical of alpine-dwelling marmots in general form and physiology. However this species can be easily distinguished from other marmots by its rich, chocolate brown fur and contrasting white patches. No other marmot species naturally occurs on Vancouver Island. The Vancouver Island marmot, as its name suggests, is geographically restricted to Vancouver Island, and apparently evolved rapidly since retreat of the Cordilleran glaciation some 10,000 years before present. Marmota vancouverensis is distinct from other marmot species in terms of morphology, genetics, behaviour, and ecology. An adult Vancouver Island marmot typically measures 56 to 70 centimetres from the tip of its nose to the tip of its tail. However, weights show tremendous seasonal variation. An adult female that weighs 3 kilograms when she emerges from hibernation in late April can weigh 4.5 to 5.5 kg by the onset of hibernation in late September or October. Adult males can be even larger, reaching weights of over 7 kg. In general, marmots lose about one-third of their body mass during the six-and-a-half months in which they hibernate during winter.  Life history, habitat characteristics and population trends  Like all marmots, Vancouver Island marmots live in burrows and are obligate herbivores. Vancouver Island marmots have been documented to eat over 30 species of food plants, generally shifting from grasses in the early spring to plants such as lupines in late summer.Martell, A.M. and R.J. Milko. 1986. Seasonal diets of Vancouver Island marmots. Canadian Field-Naturalist. 100: 241‚Äì245. Marmots hibernate for various amounts of time depending upon site characteristics and annual weather conditions. Wild Vancouver Island marmots hibernate, on average, for about 210 days of the year, generally from late September or early October until late April or early May. They generally hibernate for shorter periods in captivity. Vancouver Island marmots typically first breed at three or four years of age, although some have been observed to breed as two-year-olds. Marmots breed soon after emergence from hibernation. Gestation is thought to be approximately 30‚Äì35 days. Litter sizes average 3-4 pups, and weaned pups generally emerge above ground for the first time in early July. Systematic marmot surveys have been conducted since 1979, with variable count effort and coverage of the Island. Suitable meadows are rare compared to nearby regions of the British Columbian mainland or the Olympic peninsula of Washington State; habitat scarceness is believed to be the primary reason for the rarity of this marmot species. Most marmots live above 1000 metres elevation in meadows that face south to west. It is believed that populations expanded during the 1980s, Some natural meadows may be kept clear of invading trees by snow-creep and periodic avalanches or fire.  Conservation status  Causes of marmot population declines are numerous. Over the long term (i.e., periods involving thousands of years), climate changes have caused both increases and declines of open alpine habitat that constitute suitable marmot habitat. Over more recent time scales, population dynamics may have been influenced by short-term weather patterns and systematic changes in the landscape. In particular, forest clearcutting at low elevationsWilson, E.O: \\"The Future of Life\\", p. 52. Little, Brown, 2002 likely altered dispersal patterns. Sub-adult marmots typically disperse from the subalpine meadows in which they were born. Dispersal involves traversing lowland conifer forests and valleys to other subalpine meadows. However, clearcutting has provided marmots with new open areas which constitute habitat. Unfortunately, rapid forest regeneration makes such man-made habitats unsuitable over a few years. One study concluded that clearcuts therefore act as a kind of population \\"sink\\" in which long-term reproduction and survival rates are reduced to the point of unsustainability One 2005 study concluded the main cause of recent decline to be predation \\"associated with forestry and altered predator abundance and hunting patterns\\". Major predators upon Vancouver Island marmots include golden eagles, cougars and wolves. The population crash may also be due to the Allee effect, named after zoologist Warder Clyde Allee. Allee proposed that social animals require a critical mass in order to survive, because survival requires group activities such as warning of predators and migration. A decline below that threshold precipates rapid decline. Ecologist Justin Brashares suggests that at least some of the marmot's group behavior is learned, so that the loss of marmot \\"culture\\" has caused them to become more solitary, and interact aggressively rather than cooperatively when they do encounter each other. The endangered Vancouver Island marmot remains one of the world's rarest mammals. In 1997 there were so few numbers of marmots on Vancouver Island that managers took the bold step of capturing some to create a \\"genetic lifeboat\\" and therefore create the possibility of restoring wild populations. The first marmots went to Toronto Zoo in 1997, but this initial effort was quickly followed by efforts made by the Calgary Zoo and Mountainview Conservation and Breeding Centre in Langley, BC. The Marmot Recovery Foundation also built a dedicated marmot facility on Mt. Washington, Vancouver Island to further facilitate captive breeding and pre release conditioning. The fundamental idea was to produce marmots in a fashion that would facilitate their eventual return to the wild. In 1998 a new model for species recovery was born involving the government, private industry and public donors. A census in late 2003 resulted in a count of only 21 wild marmots known to be present on Vancouver Island. After these findings, marmots were released from captivity in different places to try to get the population back up to a reasonable number. These marmots are still classified as endangered. The cumulative captive breeding program has steadily grown, with 130 individuals in captivity (2010) and 442 weaned pups born in captivity since 2000. A number of individuals have been released to Strathcona Provincial Park, Mount Cain, Mount Washington and more southern mountains. From 2003‚Äì2010 the Marmot Recovery Foundation and the British Columbia Ministry of Environment have released 308 marmots back into the wild. More releases are expected in the upcoming years to increase the wild population, estimated at 250‚Äì300 individuals in 2010, and 350‚Äì400 individuals in 2013.  Related species  Based on genetic analyses, the closest relatives of the Vancouver Island marmot are the hoary marmot (Marmota caligata) and the Olympic marmot (Marmota olympus). There is some debate, on genetic grounds, about which of the two nearby mainland species is most closely related to the Vancouver Island marmot or when marmots first arrived on the island. The differences in DNA observed between species is small. In 2009, Nagorsen and Cardini identified, from museum specimens, substantial physical differences between species that can only be explained by rapid evolution in a relatively isolated island context.

It is regarded as one of the most important works of the modern synthesis, and was one of the earliest. The book popularized the work of population genetics to other biologists, and influenced their appreciation for the genetic basis of evolution. In his book, Dobzhansky applied the theoretical work of Sewall Wright (1889-1988) to the study of natural populations, allowing him to address evolutionary problems in a novel way during his time. Dobzhansky implements theories of mutation, natural selection, and speciation throughout his book to explain habits of populations and the resulting effects on their genetic behavior. The book explains evolution in depth as a process over time that accounts for the diversity of all life on Earth. The study of evolution was present, but greatly neglected at the time. Dobzhansky illustrates that evolution regarding the origin and nature of species during this time in history was deemed mysterious, but had expanding potential for progress to be made in its field. Background In Darwin's theory of natural selection, more organisms are produced than can survive. Some have variations that give them a competitive advantage, and they have the best chance of surviving and procreating. The main element lacking in the theory was any mechanism that would allow organisms to pass on these favorable variations. Lacking such a mechanism, the theory of evolution faced competition from theories such as neo-Lamarckism, in which the environment acted directly on organisms, changing their structures. Darwin did not know that the monk Gregor Mendel was already working on experiments that would explain inheritance in terms of units of heredity that we now call genes. When Mendelian genetics was rediscovered by several scientists, it initially increased the confusion. The Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries developed a theory called mutationism in which most variations were inconsequential and could not lead to species change. Instead, new species were formed by large mutations. At first, geneticists tended to support mutationism; but in the 1920s and 1930s a group of theoretical geneticists - particularly Ronald Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane and Sewall Wright - showed that Mendel's laws could explain continuous variation in biological characteristics; and that natural selection could act cumulatively, giving rise to large changes. Their work provided a theoretical framework for incorporating genetics into the theory of evolution. Many biologists fell into two camps: the geneticists, who mostly worked in the laboratory; and naturalists, who studied natural populations in the field and museums, and put much of their effort into taxonomy. Each contributed concepts that were essential to the understanding of evolution. Naturalists introduced the biological species concept, the definition of species as a community that is reproductively isolated and occupies a distinctive ecological niche. They also recognized that species are polytypic, having variations in time and space; and that behavior and change of function can give rise to evolutionary change. The two groups used such different methods and terminology that it was difficult for them to communicate. They were often battling over the same scarce academic resources, and each was often scornful of the other. As the paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson put it, paleontologists believed that \\"a geneticist was a person who shut himself in a room, pulled down the shades, watched small flies disporting themselves in milk bottles, and thought that he was studying nature.\\" Meanwhile, naturalists were \\"like a man who undertakes to study the principles of the internal combustion engine by standing on a street corner and watching the motor cars whiz by.\\" Publication The book began as a series of lectures at Columbia University in October and November 1936. Dobzhansky decided to attend the summer 1936 meeting of the Genetics Society of America in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. When the geneticist Leslie Dunn learned of this, he invited Dobzhansky to give a series of lectures at Columbia. He sent the invitation in April, and within a month he had suggested that the lectures be a springboard for writing a general treatise on evolutionary genetics. Dobzhansky was enthusiastic, and in May he wrote back, proposing the title \\"Genetics and the Origin of Species\\". He envisioned two parts - \\"part I containing data on the sources of evolutionary change, and part II containing a discussion of their interactions leading to race- and species formation.\\" After the lectures (for which he received $500), Dobzhansky returned to Pasadena, and in December Columbia University Press accepted his proposal for a book. The pace of writing was helped by a riding accident in February 1937 in which he crushed his knee, rendering him immobile; and by April he was able to send a manuscript to Dunn for his perusal. While reading the manuscript, Dunn persuaded the university to revive the Jesup lectures, a series that had involved some notable lecturers in the past. It was back-dated so that Dobzhansky's lectures became the first in the series. The Columbia University Biological Series was also revived, and when Genetics and the Origin of Species was published in October 1937 it became the 11th volume in that series. Three main editions were published, in 1937, 1941 and 1951, each with significant changes. Dobzhansky considered Genetics of the Evolutionary Process (1970) a fourth edition, but one so much changed that it needed a new title. Contents of the first edition Genetics and the Origin of Species has two main points to make. The first is that speciation is a genuine problem that must be explained by the theory of evolution. In nature, there is not a single population of organisms separated from each other by small variations. Instead, the natural world is divided into species, each with its own limited range of variability. The second point is that all the variations can be explained by the principles of genetics. The 1937 edition was divided into nine chapters, whose contents are described below. Organic diversity The first chapter is a short outline of the main points of the book: Evolutionary theory must account for variations on the level of the individual and also that of populations and species. It must explain how reproductive isolation can occur. And the goal is to explain all this using genetic principles that can be verified in the laboratory. Gene mutation The second chapter argues that mutations occur frequently and are random in direction. Most are small in effect, but they affect all features of organisms and vary from beneficial to lethal. They are sufficient to provide the raw material for natural selection. Mutation as a basis for racial and specific differences In the third chapter, Dobzhansky demonstrates that the mutations that are observed in the laboratory also occur in nature, where they are acted on by natural selection. Thus, there is nothing intrinsically different about the process by which new species evolve. Chromosomal changes Dobzhansky continues the theme of continuity between the laboratory and nature in chapter 4, showing that variations in the structure, arrangement and number of chromosomes occur in both the laboratory and nature. He shows that chromosomal translocation, a rearrangement of parts in chromosomes, accounts for racial differences in Datura stramonium (jimson-weed). Chromosomal inversion, a reversal of a segment, is the basis for differentiation in Drosophila. He also points out that these effects demonstrate that the chromosome parts are interdependent. Variation in natural populations Having established that the sources of natural variation are mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, Dobzhansky considers what shapes and preserves this variation. In the first edition of this book, he considers genetic drift as important as natural selection. As an example, he argued that drift was the reason for racial variations that were observed in Partula, a land snail, so these variations had no adaptive advantage. He argued that most such variations, which he called microgeographic race, was nonadaptive. Because variation is not always controlled by selection, we need to know the size of a population before we can predict its evolutionary dynamics. Selection The sixth chapter discusses the evidence for natural selection from experiments in the laboratory and observations of nature. He considered examples of camouflage such as industrial melanism, in which moths and other arthropods evolve darker pigmentation when exposed to an environment with a lot of soot in it. He refuted some Mendelian misconceptions about the effectiveness of natural selection, but he also rejected the strict selectionism of Fisher. Polyploidy In the seventh chapter, Dobzhansky discusses polyploidy, a condition (common in plants) where an organism has more than two complete sets of chromosomes. (Humans are diploid, having one set each from the mother and father.) He discusses case histories such as that of Raphanobrassica, a hybrid between the radish and the cabbage. This is an example of \\"cataclysmic\\" speciation, an exception to his general rule that speciation is a slow process. Isolating mechanisms An isolating mechanism prevents members of two different species from successfully producing offspring. Dobzhansky invented the term, and in the eighth chapter he discusses their role in speciation. His views were sufficiently original for him to publish them in a journal article as well. Although previous authors had recognized the importance of isolation, their reasons were entirely different from his. George Romanes thought that isolation was a cause of change, whereas Dobzhansky sees two competing effects. Isolation reduces the rate of formation of harmful gene combinations, but it also restricts the scope of genetic variation. Thus, a species remains near a given peak in the fitness landscape and does not find new adaptive peaks. Dobzhansky presents a classification of isolating mechanisms. The main division is between hybrid sterility, which he discusses in the next chapter, and mechanisms that prevent organisms from mating. These include geographic and ecological isolation. After two populations are changed sufficiently, \\"physiological\\" isolating mechanisms prevent them from mating, so they will remain distinct even if they are no longer physically isolated. This isolation is the end of a continuous process that includes division into races, and involves multiple mutations. Hybrid sterility In the chapter on isolating mechanisms, Dobzhansky deplores the \\"appallingly insufficient attention\\" that geneticists had devoted to isolation. The only isolating mechanism that they had studied was sterility in hybrid organisms, so he devotes the ninth chapter to a particularly detailed analysis of the literature on this subject. Experiments Male Drosophila pseudoobscura Through his work on Drosophila pseudoobscura, a species of fruitfly, Dobzhansky was able to identify that some populations of this species did not have identical sets of genes. Dobzhansky used experimental breeding in laboratories and gardens, and also surveys related to species in nature to help support aspects of organic evolution. The data in his book show the different genetic mutations and chromosomal changes that were observed. These experiments are vital to this book because they illustrate a transition from the laboratory to the greater field of genetics. Drosophila enabled researchers to gain a deeper understanding of how scientific knowledge about heredity has expanded and contributed to other areas of biology. By focusing on the opportunities and constraints of the research organism, persuasive accounts of the chromosomal genetics of Drosophila eventually evolved into the genetics of natural populations in the 1930s. All of the results from his experiments support the theory of modern evolutionary synthesis. Mutations Through his experiments, Dobzhansky discovers that mutation of genes leads to evolution within a specific species. Adaptations play a large role in genetic drift, and it is known that genes and mutations influence this genetic drift in a particular environment. Mutations can result from external influences within the surrounding environment, especially if an organism inhabits an area with harsh living conditions. An organism can adapt to its environment in order to better suit its own needs. When an organism successfully adapts, it has higher survival and reproduction rates. Therefore, there is a higher chance that its genes will be passed on to its offspring. Specific genes and alleles are then passed on to future generations to continue the trend of modern evolution that Dobzhansky presents in the book.Futuyma, D. J. Evolutionary Biology. Sunderland, Mass: Sinauer Associates, Inc., 1986. p. 9. Dobzhansky said that natural mutation, aided by variation, can lead to change when acted upon by natural selection. Mutations were thought to be relatively rare and other variations were even considered to be harmful. Since an organism's overall genetic make-up was the result of natural selection, with damaging mutations weeded out, wild populations were assumed to have very few mutations. As a result, evolution was said to be a relatively slow process. One of Dobzhansky's major contributions in this book was to show that this view of slow-moving evolution was incorrect. While analyzing chromosome structure in wild populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura, Dobzhansky discovered a surprising amount of undiscovered variability. These variations could not be observed in the outward appearance of the individual organisms. Dobzhansky suggested that the preservation of extensive variation would allow populations to evolve rapidly as environmental conditions change. This book was a landmark in the evolutionary synthesis, as it presented the union of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian theory. In Genetics and the Origin of Species, polyploidy is considered as a type of mutation. Polyploid cells have a chromosome number that is more than twice the haploid number. The effects of polyploidy between two different species causes hybridization and even greater evolution. Natural selection and speciation Natural selection in an environment produces reproductive success, which benefits the species. Speciation is a process of evolution through which new biological species are formed. Dobzhansky studied the specifics of sexual, physiological, and behavioral isolating mechanisms in Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila paulistrorum. Like many of his other studies, Dobzhansky's work on reproductive isolation was aimed at studying the process of evolution in action. Bringing samples from each population back into the laboratory, Dobzhansky showed that he could vary environmental conditions so as to produce the same changes in frequency of inversion patterns that were observed with changing seasons in the field. Dobzhansky concluded that such seasonal fluctuations were the result of natural selection at work, with temperature acting as the selecting agent. These masterful studies provided concrete support for the theory of natural selection, at the same time illustrating the fruitfulness of combining field and laboratory work in the study of evolution. Adaptive evolution occurs through the dominance and survival of competing genes within a species. This is caused by increasing the frequency of those alleles whose phenotypic effects selfishly promote their own reproduction. He also believed new species could not arise from single mutations and must be isolated from others of its species by time, geography, habitat, or breeding season. Historical impact Genetics and the Origin of Species provided the outline for a synthesis of genetics with evolution, and was enthusiastically received by both geneticists and naturalists. Dobzhansky laid out an advanced account of the evolutionary process in genetic terms, and he backed up his work with experimental evidence supporting the theoretical arguments. This led to the stimulation of the field of evolutionary genetics, and contributions to the theory soon began to follow. This had a powerful impact on naturalists and experimental biologists, who quickly embraced this new understanding of the evolutionary process as one of genetic change in populations.Jr., Lloyd T. Ackert. \\"Theodosius Grigor'evich Dobzhansky.\\" In Science and Its Times, 160-61. Detroit: Gale, 2000, p. 160-161. It was not long before the synthesis was broadened to include paleontology, systematics and botany in a series of notable books: Systematics and the Origin of Species (1942) by Ernst Mayr; Tempo and Mode in Evolution (1944) by George Gaylord Simpson; and Variation and Evolution in Plants (1950) by G. Ledyard Stebbins. The emerging synthesis was called the evolutionary synthesis by Julian Huxley in his book, Evolution: The Modern Synthesis. In 1947, a diverse collection of biologists met at a symposium in Princeton and declared their acceptance of this synthesis. However, it was not yet complete. Developmental biologists did not accept that the theory explained their observations, and it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that molecular biology bridged the gap. Also, for decades there was disagreement over whether the unit of selection was the gene or the individual as a whole. In 1974 all the living founders of the modern synthesis (with the exception of Simpson and Bernhard Rensch) met with historians of biology in a conference to evaluate their work. All acknowledged Genetics and the Origin of Species as the direct instigator of all the work that followed. Ernst Mayr, in The Growth of Biological Thought, said that it was \\"clearly the most decisive event in the history of evolutionary biology since the publication of the Origin of Species in 1859. Awards Dobzhansky was plagued by a form of leukemia in his later years, but he remained vigorously active until the day before his death on December 18, 1975. During his lifetime he was the recipient of many honors and awards. For Genetics and the Origin of Species Dobzhansky was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1941. Sixty years after its publication, the National Academy of Sciences commissioned a book entitled Genetics and the Origin of Species: From Darwin to Molecular Biology 60 Years After Dobzhansky. It was also included in the 1990 edition of Great Books of the Western World, placing it with Charles Darwin's two great works The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man. A third edition was published in 1951.

The lens was swung towards right, in order to keep the plane of focus along the train. The sensor plane, the lens plane and the plane along the train all intersect to the right of the camera. The Scheimpflug principle is a description of the geometric relationship between the orientation of the plane of focus, the lens plane, and the image plane of an optical system (such as a camera) when the lens plane is not parallel to the image plane. It is applicable to the use of some camera movements on a view camera. It is also the principle used in corneal pachymetry, the mapping of corneal topography, done prior to refractive eye surgery such as LASIK, and used for early detection of keratoconus. The principle is named after Austrian army Captain Theodor Scheimpflug, who used it in devising a systematic method and apparatus for correcting perspective distortion in aerial photographs; even though Captain Scheimpflug himself credits Jules Carpentier with the rule, thus making it an example of Stigler's law of eponymy. Description Figure 1. With a normal camera, when the subject is not parallel to the image plane, only a small region is in focus. Figure 2. The angles of the Scheimpflug principle, using the example of a photographic lens Figure 3. Rotation of the plane of focus Figure 4. Rotation-axis distance and angle of the PoF Normally, the lens and image (film or sensor) planes of a camera are parallel, and the plane of focus (PoF) is parallel to the lens and image planes. If a planar subject (such as the side of a building) is also parallel to the image plane, it can coincide with the PoF, and the entire subject can be rendered sharply. If the subject plane is not parallel to the image plane, it will be in focus only along a line where it intersects the PoF, as illustrated in Figure 1. But when a lens is tilted with respect to the image plane, an oblique tangent extended from the image plane and another extended from the lens plane meet at a line through which the PoF also passes, as illustrated in Figure 2. With this condition, a planar subject that is not parallel to the image plane can be completely in focus. While many photographers were/are unaware of the exact geometric relationship between the PoF, lens plane, and film plane, swinging and tilting the lens to swing and tilt the PoF was practiced since the mid-1800s. But, when Carpentier and Scheimpflug wanted to produce equipment to automate the process, they needed to find a geometric relationship. Scheimpflug (1904) referenced this concept in his British patent; Carpentier (1901) also described the concept in an earlier British patent for a perspective-correcting photographic enlarger. The concept can be inferred from a theorem in projective geometry of G√©rard Desargues; the principle also readily derives from simple geometric considerations and application of the Gaussian thin-lens formula, as shown in the section Proof of the Scheimpflug principle. Changing the plane of focus When the lens and image planes are not parallel, adjusting focus rotates the PoF rather than merely displacing it along the lens axis. The axis of rotation is the intersection of the lens's front focal plane and a plane through the center of the lens parallel to the image plane, as shown in Figure 3. As the image plane is moved from IP1 to IP2, the PoF rotates about the axis G from position PoF1 to position PoF2; the \\"Scheimpflug line\\" moves from position S1 to position S2. The axis of rotation has been given many different names: \\"counter axis\\" (Scheimpflug 1904), \\"hinge line\\" (Merklinger 1996), and \\"pivot point\\" (Wheeler). Refer to Figure 4; if a lens with focal length f is tilted by an angle Œ∏ relative to the image plane, the distance J from the center of the lens to the axis G is given by :J = \\\\frac f {\\\\sin \\\\theta}. If v‚Ä≤ is the distance along the line of sight from the image plane to the center of the lens, the angle œà between the image plane and the PoF is given by :\\\\tan \\\\psi = \\\\frac {v'} {v' \\\\cos \\\\theta - f} \\\\sin \\\\theta. Equivalently, on the object side of the lens, if u‚Ä≤ is the distance along the line of sight from the center of the lens to the PoF, the angle œà is given by :\\\\tan \\\\psi = \\\\frac {u'} f \\\\sin \\\\theta. The angle œà increases with focus distance; when the focus is at infinity, the PoF is perpendicular to the image plane for any nonzero value of tilt. The distances u‚Ä≤ and v‚Ä≤ along the line of sight are not the object and image distances u and v used in the thin-lens formula :\\\\frac 1 u + \\\\frac 1 v = \\\\frac 1 f, where the distances are perpendicular to the lens plane. Distances u and v are related to the line-of-sight distances by and . For an essentially planar subject, such as a roadway extending for miles from the camera on flat terrain, the tilt can be set to place the axis G in the subject plane, and the focus then adjusted to rotate the PoF so that it coincides with the subject plane. The entire subject can be in focus, even if it is not parallel to the image plane. The plane of focus also can be rotated so that it does not coincide with the subject plane, and so that only a small part of the subject is in focus. This technique sometimes is referred to as \\"anti-Scheimpflug\\", though it actually relies on the Scheimpflug principle. Rotation of the plane of focus can be accomplished by rotating either the lens plane or the image plane. Rotating the lens (as by adjusting the front standard on a view camera) does not alter linear perspective in a planar subject such as the face of a building, but requires a lens with a large image circle to avoid vignetting. Rotating the image plane (as by adjusting the back or rear standard on a view camera) alters perspective (e.g., the sides of a building converge), but works with a lens that has a smaller image circle. Rotation of the lens or back about a horizontal axis is commonly called tilt, and rotation about a vertical axis is commonly called swing. Camera movements Tilt and swing are movements available on most view cameras, often on both the front and rear standards, and on some small- and medium format cameras using special lenses that partially emulate view-camera movements. Such lenses are often called tilt-shift or \\"perspective control\\" lenses. For some camera models there are adapters that enable movements with some of the manufacturer's regular lenses, and a crude approximation may be achieved with such attachments as the 'Lensbaby' or by 'freelensing'. Depth of field Figure 5. Depth of field when the PoF is rotated When the lens and image planes are parallel, the depth of field (DoF) extends between parallel planes on either side of the plane of focus. When the Scheimpflug principle is employed, the DoF becomes wedge shaped (Merklinger 1996, 32; Tillmanns 1997, 71), with the apex of the wedge at the PoF rotation axis, as shown in Figure 5. The DoF is zero at the apex, remains shallow at the edge of the lens's field of view, and increases with distance from the camera. The shallow DoF near the camera requires the PoF to be positioned carefully if near objects are to be rendered sharply. On a plane parallel to the image plane, the DoF is equally distributed above and below the PoF; in Figure 5, the distances yn and yf on the plane VP are equal. This distribution can be helpful in determining the best position for the PoF; if a scene includes a distant tall feature, the best fit of the DoF to the scene often results from having the PoF pass through the vertical midpoint of that feature. The angular DoF, however, is not equally distributed about the PoF. The distances yn and yf are given by (Merklinger 1996, 126) :y_x = \\\\frac f {v'} \\\\frac {u'} u_\\\\mathrm{h} J \\\\,, where f is the lens focal length, v‚Ä≤ and u‚Ä≤ are the image and object distances parallel to the line of sight, uh is the hyperfocal distance, and J is the distance from the center of the lens to the PoF rotation axis. By solving the image-side equation for for v‚Ä≤ and substituting for v‚Ä≤ and uh in the equation above, the values may be given equivalently by :y_x = \\\\frac {Nc} {f} \\\\left ( \\\\frac {1} {\\\\tan \\\\theta} - \\\\frac {1} {\\\\tan \\\\psi} \\\\right ) u' \\\\,, where N is the lens f-number and c is the circle of confusion. At a large focus distance (equivalent to a large angle between the PoF and the image plane), , and (Merklinger 1996, 48) :y_x \\\\approx \\\\frac {u'} u_\\\\mathrm{h} J \\\\,, or :y_x \\\\approx \\\\frac {Nc} {f} \\\\frac {u'} {\\\\tan \\\\theta} \\\\,. Thus at the hyperfocal distance, the DoF on a plane parallel to the image plane extends a distance of J on either side of the PoF. With some subjects, such as landscapes, the wedge-shaped DoF is a good fit to the scene, and satisfactory sharpness can often be achieved with a smaller lens f-number (larger aperture) than would be required if the PoF were parallel to the image plane. Selective focus James McArdle (1991) Accomplices. The region of sharpness can also be made very small by using large tilt and a small f-number. For example, with 8¬∞ tilt on a 90 mm lens for a small-format camera, the total vertical DoF at the hyperfocal distance is approximately :2J = 2 \\\\frac {f} {\\\\sin \\\\theta} = 2 \\\\times \\\\frac {90 \\\\text{ mm}} {\\\\sin 8^\\\\circ} = 1293 \\\\text { mm} \\\\,. At an aperture of f/2.8, with a circle of confusion of 0.03 mm, this occurs at a distance u‚Ä≤ of approximately :\\\\frac {f^2} {Nc} = \\\\frac {90^2} {2.8 \\\\times 0.03} = 96.4 \\\\text { m} \\\\,. Of course, the tilt also affects the position of the PoF, so if the tilt is chosen to minimize the region of sharpness, the PoF cannot be set to pass through more than one arbitrarily chosen point. If the PoF is to pass through more than one arbitrary point, the tilt and focus are fixed, and the lens f-number is the only available control for adjusting sharpness. Derivation of the formulas  Proof of the Scheimpflug principle  Figure 6. Object plane inclined to the lens plane In a two- dimensional representation, an object plane inclined to the lens plane is a line described by :y_u=au+b . By optical convention, both object and image distances are positive for real images, so that in Figure 6, the object distance u increases to the left of the lens plane LP; the vertical axis uses the normal Cartesian convention, with values above the optical axis positive and those below the optical axis negative. The relationship between the object distance u, the image distance v, and the lens focal length f is given by the thin-lens equation :\\\\frac 1 u + \\\\frac 1 v = \\\\frac 1 f \\\\,; solving for u gives :u=\\\\frac{vf}{v-f} \\\\,, so that :y_u=a \\\\, \\\\frac {vf} {v-f} +b . The magnification m is the ratio of image height yv to object height :m=\\\\frac{y_v}{y_u} \\\\,; yu and yv are of opposite sense, so the magnification is negative, indicating an inverted image. From similar triangles in Figure 6, the magnification also relates the image and object distances, so that :m=-\\\\frac{v}{u}=-\\\\frac{v-f}{f} . On the image side of the lens, :\\\\begin{align} y_{v} & =my_{u} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & =-\\\\frac{v-f}{f}\\\\left( a \\\\, \\\\frac{vf}{v-f}+b \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & =-\\\\left( av+\\\\frac{v}{f}b-b \\\\right) \\\\,, \\\\end{align} giving :y_{v}=-\\\\left( a + \\\\frac{b}{f} \\\\right)v+b . The locus of focus for the inclined object plane is a plane; in two-dimensional representation, the y-intercept is the same as that for the line describing the object plane, so the object plane, lens plane, and image plane have a common intersection. A similar proof is given by Larmore (1965, 171‚Äì173).  Angle of the PoF with the image plane  Figure 7. Angle of the PoF with the image plane From Figure 7, :\\\\tan \\\\psi = \\\\frac {u' + v'} {S} \\\\,, where u‚Ä≤ and v‚Ä≤ are the object and image distances along the line of sight and S is the distance from the line of sight to the Scheimpflug intersection at S. Again from Figure 7, :\\\\tan \\\\theta = \\\\frac {v'} {S} \\\\,; combining the previous two equations gives :\\\\tan \\\\psi = \\\\frac {u' + v'} {v'} \\\\tan \\\\theta = \\\\left ( \\\\frac {u'} {v'} + 1 \\\\right ) \\\\tan \\\\theta \\\\,. From the thin-lens equation, :\\\\frac {1} {u} + \\\\frac {1} {v} = \\\\frac {1} {u' \\\\cos \\\\theta} + \\\\frac {1} {v' \\\\cos \\\\theta} = \\\\frac {1} {f} \\\\,. Solving for u‚Ä≤ gives :u' = \\\\frac {v' f} {v' \\\\cos \\\\theta - f} \\\\,; substituting this result into the equation for gives :\\\\tan \\\\psi = \\\\left ( \\\\frac {f} {v' \\\\cos \\\\theta - f} + 1 \\\\right ) \\\\tan \\\\theta = \\\\frac {f + v' \\\\cos \\\\theta - f} {v' \\\\cos \\\\theta -f} \\\\tan \\\\theta \\\\,, or :\\\\tan \\\\psi = \\\\frac {v'} {v' \\\\cos \\\\theta - f} \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\,. Similarly, the thin-lens equation can be solved for v‚Ä≤, and the result substituted into the equation for to give the object-side relationship :\\\\tan \\\\psi = \\\\frac {u'} {f} \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\,. Noting that :\\\\frac {u'} {f} = \\\\frac {u} {f} \\\\frac {1} {\\\\cos \\\\theta} = \\\\frac {m + 1} {m} \\\\frac {1} {\\\\cos \\\\theta} \\\\,, the relationship between œà and Œ∏ can be expressed in terms of the magnification m of the object in the line of sight: :\\\\tan \\\\psi = \\\\frac {m + 1} {m} \\\\tan \\\\theta \\\\,.  Proof of the \\"hinge rule\\"  From Figure 7, :\\\\tan \\\\psi = \\\\frac {u'} {J} \\\\,; combining with the previous result for the object side and eliminating œà gives :\\\\sin \\\\theta = \\\\frac {f} {J} \\\\,. Again from Figure 7, :\\\\sin \\\\theta = \\\\frac {d} {J} \\\\,, so the distance d is the lens focal length f, and the point G is at the intersection the lens's front focal plane with a line parallel to the image plane. The distance J depends only on the lens tilt and the lens focal length; in particular, it is not affected by changes in focus. From Figure 7, :\\\\tan \\\\theta = \\\\frac {v'} {S} \\\\,, so the distance to the Scheimpflug intersection at S varies as the focus is changed. Thus the PoF rotates about the axis at G as focus is adjusted. Notes References * Carpentier, Jules. 1901. Improvements in Enlarging or like Cameras. GB Patent No. 1139.

Developed as part of the rebuilding of Germany's armoured fighting vehicle industry, the Marder has proven to be a successful and solid infantry fighting vehicle design. While it used to include a few unique features, such as a fully remote machine gun on the rear deck and gun ports on the sides for infantry to fire through, these features have been deleted or streamlined in later upgrade packages to bring it more in line with modern IFV design (the MG has been moved to be a coaxial, the gun ports entirely welded shut and uparmored). It is overall a simple and conventional machine with one large rear exit hatch and three top hatches for mounted infantry to fire from. The Marder is currently being replaced by its successor, the Puma. Around 2,100 were taken into service by the German Army in the early 1970s, but the vehicle in its German variant was not sold to any foreign militaries. As the German Army began to retire older vehicles, the Chilean government agreed to acquire 200 Marders; the government of Greece has considered the purchase of 450 retired vehicles in the past. Argentina uses a simplified and locally produced variant, the VCTP, and has a number of vehicles based on that platform constructed by Henschel and built by TAMSE. Development Development of the Marder ran from January 1960, when the first development contracts were issued, to 7 May 1971, when the first production vehicles were given to the German army. The vehicle was intended to be an improvement over the Sch√ºtzenpanzer Lang HS.30. The main requirements were: * A capacity of 12 infantrymen. * A more reliable 20 mm cannon. * The infantry must be able to fight from within the vehicle or dismounted. * Protection from nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Initially, development contracts were awarded to two groups of companies: the Rheinstahl group (Rheinstahl-Hanomag, Ruhrstahl, Witten-Annen, B√ºro Warnecke) and the second group comprising Henschel Werke and the Swiss MOWAG company. This resulted in the production of seven prototype vehicles. A second set of eight prototype vehicles were built between 1961 and 1963. Development priority was then switched for a while to the development of the Jagdpanzer 90 mm Kanone. In 1967, after military requirements were finalized, a third and final set of ten prototypes were built. Final development work was completed by the Rheinstahl group, and 10 pre-production vehicles were built and completed troop trials with the German army between October 1968 and March 1969. In May 1969, the vehicle was officially named the \\"Marder\\" and in October Rheinstahl was chosen as the prime contractor. Maschinenbau Kiel AG (MaK) hands over the first Marder to the Bundeswehr on 7 May 1971. Marder on maneuvers in 1986. The first production Marder was handed to the German army on 7 May 1971. Production of the vehicle continued until 1975, with 2,136 vehicles being completed. In 1975, the Milan missile was first adapted to be fired by commander from his open hatch, and between 1977 and 1979 Milan missiles were fitted to army vehicles. A number of upgrade programs were carried out, that included fitting night vision equipment and a thermal imager, as well as an upgraded ammunition feed to the 20 mm cannon. Around 1985, the designation was changed to Marder 1 (until then it was simply Marder) since a follow-up IFV was under construction. The new vehicle was supposed to be the partner of the Leopard 2, just like Marder was the companion to the Standardpanzer/Leopard 1, it was named Marder 2 and the older vehicles re-designated. The A3 upgrade program began in 1988, with Thyssen-Henschel being awarded a contact to upgrade 2,100 Marder 1 A1/A2 series vehicles to A3 standard at a rate of 220 a year. The first upgraded vehicles reached the German army on 17 November 1989. The modification package included: * Improved armour weighing 1,600 kg intended to protect against the 30 mm 2A42 cannon on the Russian BMP-2. The armour also provided additional protection against cluster bomblets. * The hatches over the infantry compartment were re-arranged. * Suspension was reinforced, a new braking system was installed, the gearbox adjusted. The heating system was replaced with a water based heating system. * Turret was reconfigured. * Total weight is now 35,000 kg. Description A Marder 1A3 from the rear, with the ramp lowered The hull of the Marder 1 is all welded steel, giving protection from small-arms fire and shell fragments with the front of the hull providing protection from up to 20 millimeters APDS rounds. Later variants had increased protection up to 30mm APDS, in response to the 30 mm autocannon armed BMP-2 and the development of top attack cluster bomblets. The Marder is a relatively conventional design, with the driver sitting at the front left side of the hull with the engine to his right. The driver has three day periscopes mounted in a hatch that opens to the right. The center periscope can be replaced by a passive night vision device. Behind the driver is a seat for a single infantry man. In early versions of the Marder, this man had a hatch that opened to the right and a periscope that could be rotated through 360 degrees; this hatch was removed in the 1A3 variant onwards. In the center of the hull is the two- man turret, which holds the commander on the right and the gunner on the left. Only the commander is provided with a hatch. The commander has eight day periscopes for all round observation and the gunner has an additional three. The primary sighting system is the PERI-Z11 sight, which has either 2√ó or 6√ó optical magnification. From version 1A2 on, there was an additional thermal sight with 2x and 8x magnification. To the rear of the turret is the troop compartment, which can hold six infantry men, sitting back to back facing outwards along the center of the hull. The Marder is capable of fording in up to 1.5 meters of water unprepared, and can be fitted with a kit allowing it to ford water up to 2.5 meters deep. The Marder is powered by an MTU MB 833 Ea-500 six-cylinder liquid-cooled diesel engine which delivers approximately at 2,200 rpm. The cooling radiators are mounted at the rear of hull either side of the exit ramp. The engine is coupled to a Renk four speed HSWL 194 planetary gear box with four forward and four reverse gears. The transmission also provides steering and braking via a stepless hydrostatic unit which transmits power to two drive units mounted at the front of the hull. The vehicle carries 652 liters of fuel, giving it a road range of around 500 kilometers. Early Marders could achieve a road speed of 75 km/h in 4th gear, but the extra armour of later vehicles reduced this to 65 km/h. The Marder is propelled by a Diehl track, which can be fitted with rubber road pads. The drive mechanism consists of six rubber tyred road wheel with a drive sprocket at the front of the hull and an idler at the rear. Three return rollers are also fitted. The suspension is a torsion bar system, with additional hydrostatic shock absorbers fitted to the front two and last two road wheels. Armament A Marder 1 A3 fires its 20 mm cannon in an exercise. A Marder 1 A5 Primary armament is the 20 mm Rheinmetall MK 20 Rh202 autocannon, which is mounted in the small two-man turret and can fire either armour-piercing or HE rounds. Mounted coaxially to the left of the cannon is a 7.62 mm MG3 machine gun. The turret has 360 degree traverse, and can elevate from ‚àí17 degrees to +65 degrees at a rate of 40 degrees per second while traversing at a rate of 60 degrees a second. Early Marders up to and including version 1A1 had a second MG3 mounted on the rear deck in a remote controlled pod. Typically, 1,250 rounds are carried for the 20 mm cannon, along with a further 5,000 rounds for the MG3. On models since version 1A1A, a MILAN anti-tank guided missile launcher can be attached to the turret to provide enhanced anti-armour capabilities. Typically, four missiles are carried inside the vehicle. There are four (two per side) gun ports, which can be used by mounted infantry to provide additional fire against attacking infantry targets. Only Marder 1A1 and 1A2 had been equipped with this. Marder 1A3 and above do not have gun ports due to an extra layer of armour and outside storage boxes. Six 76-millimeter-diameter smoke grenade dischargers can create a visual and infra-red blocking smoke screen. Variants A Marder 1A3 fires a Milan missile during an exercise. The Marder 1A3Rheinmetall Defence Displays Two Marder Upgrades is the currently most common version of this system, and is in service with the German Bundeswehr, the Marder 1A4 differs from the 1A3 only by the use of a cryptography-capable radio-set. Newest version of the Marder is the Marder 1A5 with advanced mine protection. Only a small number of this variant is in service. The Marder served as the basis for Thyssen-Henschel's medium tank design which became the TAM for Argentina. A simplified version of the Marder is also employed as an infantry fighting vehicle, mortar carrier and rocket launcher by the Argentine Army, realising most of the versions originally planned for the Bundeswehr and later abandoned due to costs and/or the availability of cheap alternatives like the M106 mortar carrier. The Marder is also used as a carrier for the Roland air defence system. The Kanonenjagdpanzer and Raketenjagdpanzer 2 started development as part of the Marder family but were realised based on the second batch of prototypes using different engines etc. The Kanonenjagdpanzer built for Belgium are a hybrid between the original Bundeswehr version and Marder parts. Some 4‚Äì6 test models of a 120 mm mortar on a Marder chassis were built and at least one is in use as a firefighting vehicle at the WTS Meppen. Tests with an AAA tank were performed but the high weight of the system resulted in a switch to the heavier Standardpanzer chassis, resulting in the Gepard AAA system. At least one first or second generation prototype was equipped with the 110 mm artillery rocket system that later became the truck-mounted LARS system. During Eurosatory Show 2012, Rheinmetall Landsysteme GmbH offered two further upgrades as part of the Marder Evolution family. The Marder APC features a new M151 Protector remotely controlled weapon, replacing the original Rheinmetall MK 20 Rh 202 automatic cannon, ballistic protection comparable to STANAG Level 4+, and mine protection comparable to Level 3a/3b+. The top deck has been lifted to enable improved ergonomics and uses a MTU MB883 diesel. The Marder Medium Tank features a rifled, stabilized 105 mm Oto-Melara gun in a new turret.http://defense-update.com/20120611_marder-upgrades.html A prototype of the experimental Marder 2. * Marder 1 (1971‚Äì) ** Marder 1 with Milan: a Milan launcher was fitted to all Marders between 1977 and 1979. ** Marder 1 A1(+) (1979‚Äì1982): dual feed for 20 mm cannon enabling choice of ammunition, night vision equipment including image intensifiers and a thermal imager.

With the first unit delivered in summer 1971, the Marder IFV remained untested in combat for 38 years until July 2009 when they defended a German combat outpost against the Taliban in Chahar Dara district of Afghanistan's Kunduz Province, killing and wounding scores of insurgents. Since then, the Marders have been involved in heavy fighting several times. The vehicles have proved to be extremely useful and have been praised as a great tactical asset by German troops.Freundeskreis der Panzergrenadiertruppe e.V. und Lachen Helfen bauen Wasserspeicher in Afghanistan Freundeskreis der Panzergrenadiertruppe e.V However, the crews have been subject to great physical stress as none of the vehicles are equipped with air conditioning systems.Neuer Panzer f√ºr die Truppe Two Marders were damaged by Improvised explosive devices in the course of a German-led offensive on Taliban insurgents in Quatliam, on 31 October 2010. Later in the battle, code-named by the Coalition \\"Operation Halmazag\\", the Marders beat off a Taliban attempt to outflank positions held by German paratroopers. In June 2011, a German Marder was destroyed near Kunduz by a 200 kg (440.91 lbs.) IED, killing one soldier and injuring five others. The Marder was also deployed during the Kosovo War as part of the German peacekeeping forces sent. They did not see combat however.

They are caused by infection with a variety of pathogens, including rickettsia and other types of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Because individual ticks can harbor more than one disease-causing agent, patients can be infected with more than one pathogen at the same time, compounding the difficulty in diagnosis and treatment. 16 tick- borne diseases of humans are known, of which four have been discovered since 2013. As the incidence of tick-borne illnesses increases and the geographic areas in which they are found expand, health workers increasingly must be able to distinguish the diverse, and often overlapping, clinical presentations of these diseases. Several high-profile deaths have been caused by the tick‚Äìhuman transmission of disease, including the death of former Senator Kay Hagan in the United States in 2019 at the age of 66. Diagnosis and treatment In general, specific laboratory tests are not available to rapidly diagnose tick- borne diseases. Due to their seriousness, antibiotic treatment is often justified based on clinical presentation alone. Exposure Ticks tend to be more active during warmer months, though this varies by geographic region and climate. Areas with woods, bushes, high grass, or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Those bitten commonly experience symptoms such as body aches, fever, fatigue, joint pain, or rashes. People can limit their exposure to tick bites by wearing light-colored clothing (including pants and long sleeves), using insect repellent with 20%‚Äì30% DEET, tucking their pants legs into their socks, checking for ticks frequently, and washing and drying their clothing (in a hot dryer). Assessing risk For a person or companion animal to acquire a tick-borne disease requires that the individual gets bitten by a tick and that the tick feeds for a sufficient period of time. The feeding time required to transmit pathogens differs for different ticks and different pathogens. Transmission of the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is well understood to require a substantial feeding period. For an individual to acquire infection, the feeding tick must also be infected. Not all ticks are infected. In most places in the US, 30-50% of deer ticks will be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi (the agent of Lyme disease). Other pathogens are much more rare. Ticks can be tested for infection using a highly specific and sensitive qPCR procedure. Several commercial labs provide this service to individuals for a fee. The Laboratory of Medical Zoology (LMZ), a nonprofit lab at the University of Massachusetts, provides a comprehensive TickReport for a variety of human pathogens and makes the data available to the public. Those wishing to know the incidence of tick-borne diseases in their town or state can search the LMZ surveillance database. Examples Major tick-borne diseases include: Bacterial * Lyme disease or borreliosis **Organism: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (bacterium) **Vector: deer tick (Ixodes scapularis (=I. dammini), I. pacificus, I. ricinus (Europe), I. persulcatus (Asia)) **Endemic to: North America and Eurasia **Symptoms: Fever, arthritis, neuroborreliosis, erythema migrans, cranial nerve palsy, carditis, fatigue, and influenza-like illness **Treatment: Antibiotics - amoxicillin in pregnant adults and children), (doxycycline in other adults *Relapsing fever (tick- borne relapsing fever, different from Lyme disease due to different Borrelia species and ticks) **Organisms: Borrelia species such as B. hermsii, B. parkeri, B. duttoni, B. miyamotoi **Vector: Ornithodoros species **Regions : Primarily in Africa, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Asia in and certain areas of Canada and the western United States **Symptoms: Relapsing fever typically presents as recurring high fevers, flu-like symptoms, headaches, and muscular pain, with less common symptoms including rigors, joint pain, altered mentation, cough, sore throat, painful urination, and rash. **Treatment: Antibiotics are the treatment for relapsing fever, with doxycycline, tetracycline, or erythromycin being the treatment of choice.. *Typhus Several diseases caused by Rickettsia bacteria (below) *Rocky Mountain spotted fever **Organism: Rickettsia rickettsii **Vector: Wood tick (Dermacentor variabilis), D. andersoni **Region (US): East, Southwest **Vector: Amblyomma cajennense **Region (Brazil): S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais. **Symptoms:Fever, headache, altered mental status, myalgia, and rash **Treatment: Antibiotic therapy, typically consisting of doxycycline or tetracycline *Helvetica spotted fever **Organism: Rickettsia helvetica **Region(R. helvetica): Confirmed common in ticks in Sweden, Switzerland, France, and Laos **Vector/region(s)#1: Ixodes ricinus is the main European vector. **Symptoms: Most often small red spots, other symptoms are fever, muscle pain, headache and respiratory problems **Treatment: Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is needed, phenoxymethylpenicillin likely is sufficient. *Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly human granulocytic ehrlichiosis or HGE) **Organism: Anaplasma phagocytophilum (formerly Ehrlichia phagocytophilum or Ehrlichia equi) **Vector: Lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), I. scapularis **Region (US): South Atlantic, South-central *Bartonella: Bartonella transmission rates to humans via tick bite are not well established but Bartonella is common in ticks.

He took the name \\"Severin\\" from the Leopold von Sacher-Masoch character who is mentioned in the Velvet Underground song \\"Venus in Furs\\". Severin had earlier considered \\"Steve Spunker\\" for his stage name. After the split of Siouxsie and the Banshees in 1996, Severin created his own label RE: and released several instrumental albums via his official website. In the late 2000s and the early 2010s, he regularly performed live in solo, playing music over footage of silent films. Biography He grew up in Archway and moved in Bromley at the age of 11. On a Sunday afternoon in 1971, he discovered German rock band Can thanks to a schoolfriend's elder brother in the army who was stationed in Hamburg. At 15, Severin saw Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band in concert in London which was a life changing experience. His favourite writers when he was a teenager, were William Burroughs and Jean Genet amongst others: he said, \\"Since I was very young I‚Äôve always felt the need to retreat into my head and scratch around the rim of my imagination to shut out the trivia and carelessness of the world outside\\". Siouxsie and the Banshees Severin‚Äîwho was known as Steven Havoc when he joined the band‚Äîwas the co- founder. He was a full contributor to Siouxsie and the Banshees' musical output from the first release (the B-side to the top 10 single \\"Hong Kong Garden\\" was the Severin-penned \\"Voices\\"). Although the entire band often was credited for songwriting, the lyrics were usually indicated as the work of only one or two members. Severin would contribute lyrics to many of the album tracks, singles and B-sides produced by the band. He also initially wrote many of the songs recorded by the band, composing earlier versions that the band would work together to perfect. In the same way he would add his input into potential tracks contributed by Sioux or others. He recorded 11 studio albums with the group. Since their split in 1996, he has been supervising the entire back-catalogue, choosing extra-tracks for reissues. Other artists and bands During his tenure with Siouxsie and the Banshees, Severin was also involved in records by other bands, often with Banshees connections. Altered Images had toured as a support act for Siouxsie and the Banshees and Severin produced their first two singles \\"Dead Pop Stars\\" and \\"A Day's Wait\\". He also produced the majority of the album Happy Birthday (all 1981). The only track not produced by him was the title track (which also formed the intro and coda), which became the band's breakthrough hit. When the record company realized that \\"Happy Birthday\\" had a commercial potential, they asked Martin Rushent to re-record it at the last minute. In 1982, he produced, and played bass on, the Lydia Lunch EP The Agony Is the Ecstasy and in 1983 co-wrote the song \\"Torment\\" with Marc Almond on the latter's LP Torment and Toreros (by Marc and the Mambas). In 1985, he produced an EP of The Flowerpot Men, titled Jo's so mean to Josephine which \\"has become a proto-techno classic\\". The Glove Severin's work outside the Banshees, in this period, is however most known for The Glove, his side project with The Cure's (and then current Banshee guitarist) Robert Smith. Severin came up with the name, the title and the blue/yellow sleeve concept. This led to the release of the album Blue Sunshine and two attendant singles. The album reached number 35 in the UK charts in 1983 and the single \\"Like an Animal\\" peaked just outside the UK top 50. The next single from the album, \\"Punish Me with Kisses\\", only just made it into the top 100. Though Smith did sing on a few tracks, the featured vocalist is Jeanette Landray ‚Äì a friend of Banshee drummer Budgie who was at the time involved in progressing a musical relationship with Siouxsie under The Creatures banner. The album is noted for its low-level musical interludes between tracks. Musically close enough to the differing Cure and Banshee styles to attract large sections of both sets of fans, the more experimental nature and references to 1960's psychedelia and pop-art also attracted a more eclectic audience. The use of keyboards and synthesizers, as well as the inclusion of instrumental only tracks, were also an early pointer to Severin's post Banshee musical output. Solo work: 1989‚Äìpresent Severin's post- Banshees output was the Visions of Ecstasy soundtrack, created for the Nigel Wingrove short film interpretation of the writings of Saint Teresa of Avila. This 1989 sensual fantasy film remained unreleased until 2012, as it has been refused a certificate on the grounds of blasphemy ‚Äì the only film so banned by The British Board of Film Classification. The four parts written by Severin for the soundtrack, \\"Sphere\\", \\"Come Deliver Us\\", \\"Skin Crawl\\" and \\"Transverberation of the Heart\\", formed the basis of his first post-Banshees release. Almost 10 years after creating the Visions of Ecstasy soundtrack, Severin released an album entitled Visions, featuring four tracks derived from the original pieces written for the film, plus another five instrumentals. Severin completely reworked the soundtrack ‚Äì originally eighteen minutes long ‚Äì into a forty-five-minute ambient album. It was also the first release by Severin's RE: records label. The record also featured Banshees' cello player and keyboardist Martin McCarrick. Visions was first only available via his website and was then distributed by Cargo. In 1999, Severin released Maldoror. The origins for this instrumental album were as far back as 1993, when Severin wrote some tracks for Brazilian Theatre Company \\"Os Satyros\\" production of Lautr√©amont's Chants of Maldoror. After losing and regaining contact with the group, Severin composed further pieces for the 1998 production Os Cantos des Maldoror. These pieces were collected together and released on CD. That same year, Severin had been invited to be musical director for the Canadian dance company \\"Holy Body Tattoo\\" on CIRCA ‚Äì described as a 70-minute multimedia \\"celebration of the sensual forces of submission and control\\" ‚Äì a postmodern deconstruction of the tango that interwove film footage by William Morrison and original music by Severin, Warren Ellis and cult cabaret trio The Tiger Lillies. The music from CIRCA was largely drawn from Martyn Jacques and company's album Circus Songs. Severin contributed keyboards and also produced this album for the Tiger Lillies. Severin's third RE: release, The Woman in the Dunes was specially commissioned by Shakti and the Vasanta Mala dance company to accompany the stage production of the K≈çb≈ç Abe novel of the same name. It premiered at the ICA in the summer of 2000. The only vocal included is \\"I Put a Spell on You\\"; a version of the Screaming Jay Hawkins classic sung by Jarboe (ex Swans). Severin returned to composing soundtracks, and in 2003 film director Robert Pratten approached Severin to compose the soundtrack for his first film, a British independent supernatural thriller called London Voodoo. The film contained four tracks that Severin collaborated on with his wife and songwriting partner Arban, under the name \\"Darling Hate\\". As a result of this new direction, Severin wound down his RE: label to concentrate on writing for film and television. London Voodoo was followed by a soundtrack for The Purifiers, the second film feature by Richard Jobson, which premiered at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2004. The tracks extensively used in the score were \\"Enter Into These Bonds\\" from Visions and \\"Prelude:Europa\\" from Maldoror. In 2005, Severin released another album based on a soundtrack originally commissioned by the Indo/Japanese performer Shakti in August 2003 for her interpretation of the story of Beauty and the Beast. The album Beauty and the Beast is credited to Arban and Steven Severin. It was the first release on their Subconscious Music label. Though jointly credited, the 50-minute score was created in an original manner which owed much to the circumstances in producing it. As it was commissioned to accompany a dance production, the titles and timing of each individual part was already decided upon by Shakti, who also suggested the theme for each piece. Owing to other commitments upon their time, it was decided by Arban and Severin that each would work on alternating pieces individually. Arban Severin took responsibility for the odd-numbered tracks and Severin for the others. After a piece was substantially completed it was given over to the other partner to review and to make contributions. Only when both parties were satisfied was the track considered finished. This method of working was renewed for the following project, the soundtrack for director Paul Burrow's psychological thriller \\"Nature Morte\\" (Still Life). This film score recording was released on 16 October 2006, again under the Subconscious Music label. In the mid-2000s, Severin left London and moved to Scotland to reside in Edinburgh. In 2008, Severin started composing scores for silent films of the 1920s and 1930s, the first being Germaine Dulac‚Äôs The Seashell and the Clergyman: he also made scores for 6 short films and got in contact with Picturehouse, to play in their cinemas in the UK. The first \\"Music for Silents\\" show was done in May. In 2009, Severin and Arban scored director Matthew Mishory's film Delphinium: A Childhood Portrait of Derek Jarman, a tribute to Steven's old friend Derek Jarman. The film has been permanently installed in the British Film Institute's National Film Archive, in the special collection Beautiful Things, \\"a major collection of over 100 films and television programmes that chronicle and explore queer representation and identities over the last century\\".Beautiful Things bfi.org. 2009. Retrieved 2 November 2017. In 2010 Severin released his debut album for Cold Spring titled Blood of a Poet. The album is a recording of his soundtrack for a 1930 silent movie by Jean Cocteau which was screened alongside his live performance at Montreal's Fantasia festival.Steven Severin Blood Of A Poet (Le Sang D'Un Po√®te) coldspring.co.uk. Retrieved August 2014 After the premiere of the tour performed at The Hollywood Silent Film Theatre in Los Angeles, a UK tour took place in autumn 2010. In 2011, Severin and Arban renewed their collaboration with filmmaker Matthew Mishory, scoring his feature film Joshua Tree, 1951: A Portrait of James Dean: the film would be released a couple of years later. That year, Severin also composed a score to Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr; it was his second collaboration with the label Cold Spring. Vampyr was the longest score he ever attempted. It completed a trilogy that had started with The Seashell & The Clergyman then Blood of a Poet. He then went on tour in Europe in 2012. After a hiatus of several years, he released in March 2017 via his website a 6-track album The Vril Harmonies, followed in April by another 8-track album Innocence and Blood and #002FA7 (International Klein Blue). In 2019, a 23 minute track titled 23 Wounds Of Julius Caesar (reincarnation) was dedicated to the memory of Jhon Balance (co-founder of the group Coil) and Peter Christopherson (of Throbbing Gristle). Influences and style After first seeing Paul McCartney at an early age, the first bass player who impressed him was Jack Bruce. Then in the early 1970s, Can's Holger Czukay became his bass hero. Severin played bass in an unusual way, hitting strings \\"upside down\\". He stated: \\"It just came naturally. Moving slowly up and down seems so passive to me considering the music was so aggressive. It's also about the precision of every single note\\". Commenting his work as film composer, he said: \\" I dislike [...] signposts emotions. [...] You just have to create a bed for the emotion that‚Äôs already there, to heighten it\\". Writing In the late 1990s, Severin wrote several articles which were published in The Guardian and The Independent.

He bears the same name as, but should not be confused with, his grandson, the Greek War of Independence hero of the early 19th century. The Ypsilantis were a prominent family of Phanariotes. Reign In 1774, as a diplomat in service to the Porte, Ypsilanti took part in the signing of the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji with Russia; a year later, he was rewarded for this and other services by being appointed Dragoman of the Porte. Still in 1775, he was awarded the throne of Wallachia. This could only happen as the Russian troops were ending their occupation of Bucharest, begun in 1771. The throne had been vacant throughout this period, a hiatus provoked by Emanuel Giani Ruset's agreement with Catherine II at the start of the war. As principal acts of his reign in Wallachia, Ypsilanti enforced a series of reforms. Several laws are grouped in the Pravilniceasca condicƒÉ, called \\"Syntagmation nomikon\\" in its Greek version (roughly: \\"The Code of Byzantine customary laws\\"). Issued in 1780, the Code sought to amend fiscal, administrative, judicial and political flaws. During his judicial reform, Ipsilanti created civil courts in each Wallachian county.Djuvara, p. 69 What was in fact a radical redefinition of legal boundaries had to make occasional reference to Byzantine norms (the traditional laws in the two Principalities), due to resistance from conservative boyars in the Assembly (the Sfat). Most notably, the new laws tried to impose salaries for public offices, a measure intended to reduce fiscal burdens on the taxed social categories (that had been supposed to provide revenues for the fiscal agents, usually boyars, in an economy in which land ownership had become less of an asset than holding office) and ensure a more professional administrative structure. Ypsilanti's reigns coincide with a critical moment in Ottoman history. In August 1787, Russia resumed hostilities (see Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1792)), and the Porte faced a large-scale invasion of its Danubian territories as the Habsburg Empire joined the fighting (9 February 1788). A secondary effect of this event was the granting of military command over Turkish troops in the region to Ypsilanti: the gesture is also significant as a temporary re-shaping of status in the relations between Prince and Sultan for the context of Phanariote rule. Sources suggest that Ypsilanti was considering an alliance with Austria, and had been negotiating with emissaries of Emperor Joseph II. However, as the Austrians occupied Ia≈üi in April, all contacts ceased and the Prince was kept in custody in Brno up to the signing of the peace treaty at Sistowa (autumn of 1791).

Degree completion programs are typically structured to allow persons who previously completed a substantial portion of the requirements for an undergraduate degree, but who have been separated from the university setting for a period of time, to complete the credit requirements needed to earn a bachelor's degree (B.A.), either at an accelerated pace, or a flexible schedule. The difference between credits previously earned, and those required for the award of a B.A., are made-up through a variety of methods depending on the sponsoring institution, but typically include a combination of traditional university courses and CLEP examinations. Examples * Georgetown University bills its degree completion program as designed for students who were \\"meaning to complete\\" their bachelor's degree, but for whom \\"life, work and other obligations got in the way\\". Applications are accepted from working adults who have completed one or two years of university courses which can be transferred onto the potential student's Georgetown transcript. A series of evening and weekend classes fills the gap between credits earned and those required for a bachelor's degree. * The degree completion program at the University of the Pacific is open to applicants who have completed 70-credits of university level course work. Once enrolled, students take a twice-weekly, evening class over the course of four semesters; those who successfully complete the 15-month instructional sequence are awarded a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies. * Colorado State University offers a degree completion program in psychology. Students can transfer up to 90 credits of coursework taken at another university before completing the final 30 credits required for a B.A. degree through distance learning psychology courses at Colorado State. * University of San Francisco offers a Bachelor of Science in Management to working professionals who are interested in completing their degree. Students who have completed at least 60 semester credits may apply to the program and can earn their degree in as little as 23 months. Students take two courses each semester, and studies include accounting, finance, marketing, organizational behavior and theory, analytics, technology, logistics, and other core competencies. * University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln offers an online Bachelor of Science degree completion program in applied science. Students select from a broad range of courses across the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, in addition to the credits they've already earned, to tailor a degree to their career goals. This program provides a convenient and flexible career path for those in the military, currently employed, returning to college or transferring from a two-year college.

The first true greengage came from a green-fruited wild plum () originated in Iran (Persia). Greengages are grown in temperate areas and are known for the rich, confectionery flavour. They are considered to be among the finest dessert plums. The Oxford English Dictionary regards \\"gage\\" and \\"greengage\\" as synonyms. However, not all gages are green, and some horticulturists make a distinction between the two words, with greengages as a variety of the gages, scientifically named Prunus domestica (subsp. italica var. claudiana.)Melinda Smale (Editor) Andrew F. Smith The gages otherwise include the large and usually purple to blackish but occasionally bright yellow round plums as well as the ancient and little-known Austrian varieties Punze (var. rotunda) and Weinkriech (var. vinaria). Description Greengage fruit are identified by their round-oval shape and smooth-textured, pale green flesh; they are on average smaller than round plums but larger than mirabelle plums (usually between 2 and 4 cm diameter). The skin ranges in colour from green to yellowish, with a pale blue \\"blush\\" in some cultivars; a few Reine Claudes, such as 'Graf Althanns', are reddish-purple due to crossbreeding with other plums. History and etymology Greengage fruit originated in Iran. \\"Green Gages\\" were allegedly first imported into England from France in 1724 by Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet, from whom they get their English name, though a greengage seed was found embedded in a 15th-century building in Hereford. Supposedly, the labels identifying the French plum trees were lost in transit to Gage's home at Hengrave Hall, near Bury St Edmunds(Chambers's 20th Century Dictionary, 1903). and recent research indicates that it was a cousin and namesake Sir William Gage, 2nd Baronet of Hengrave who was responsible for introducing the greengage to England. \\"The curse of the greengage\\" Soon after, greengages were cultivated in the American colonies, even being grown on the plantations of American presidents George Washington (1732‚Äì1799) and Thomas Jefferson (1743‚Äì1826). However, their cultivation in North America has declined significantly since the 18th century. The name Reine Claude (French for \\"Queen Claude\\"), by which they are known in France, is in honour of the French queen Claude (1499‚Äì1524), Duchess of Brittany.

Prunus domestica subsp. italica flowers At least the green cultivars breed more or less true from seed.

All of the balls in the three machines, except those numbered 4 and 6, were weighted, meaning that the drawing was almost sure to be a combination of those digits. The scheme was successful in that 666 (one of the eight combinations of 4s and 6s that the \\"fixers\\" were hoping for) was drawn on April 24, 1980; however, the unusual betting patterns alerted authorities to the crime. The chief conspirators were sent to prison, and most of the fraudulently acquired winnings were never paid out. Planning The plan was masterminded by Nick Perry (1916‚Äì2003),http://old.post- gazette.com/obituaries/20030424perry2.asp The Daily Numbers announcer. Perry was born Nicholas Pericles Katsafanas in the Morningside neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended Peabody High School and Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. After serving in the U.S. Navy in World War II, Perry began a career as a radio broadcaster in Charleston, West Virginia, then entered television broadcasting on Pittsburgh's WDTV, the forerunner of KDKA- TV. Perry later moved over to rival WTAE-TV in 1958, as a staff announcer. Later, he became a news and weather reporter and was the host of local sports shows like Bowling for Dollars and Championship Bowling. In 1977, Perry became the host of the live nightly broadcast of the Pennsylvania Lottery, held in the studios of WTAE. Perry first discussed his idea with Jack and Peter Maregos, two of his partners in a vending machine business. Once committed to the plan, Perry approached local Pittsburgh lettering expert and WTAE art director Joseph Bock about creating weighted ping-pong balls that were replicas of the official balls used in the lottery machines. The No. 4 and No. 6 balls were chosen as the lucky lighter balls. Perry got access to the machines and ping-pong balls, which had been kept in a room at WTAE studios, https://archive.triblive.com/news/666-an-infamous-mark-of-state-lottery-fix- in-1980/ through Edward Plevel, a lottery official. The room was locked with two keys. Perry had one key and Plevel had the other. Plevel left the machines and balls unguarded for several minutes on a few occasions. Perry also got WTAE stagehand Fred Luman to physically switch the original balls with the weighted ones twice: once before and once after the drawing. Bock then took the rigged balls back to his studio and burned them in a paint can a half-hour after the on-air drawing was done. Drawing Perry was the host of The Daily Number on April 24, 1980, when the drawing produced the number \\"666\\" for a then-record payout of $3.5 million ($ today) ‚Äî including $1.18 million ($ today) that went to eight people in on the scam, https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-apr-29-me-passings29.1-story.html while six million Pennsylvanians watched that night never knowing that the fix was in. Lottery authorities and local bookmakers became suspicious when they noticed that a large number of tickets were purchased for the eight possible combinations, and a handful of players came forward to claim approximately $1.8 million ($ today) of the then-record $3.5 million payout ($ today). On the date of the drawing, the Maragos brothers traveled around Pennsylvania buying large quantities of tickets containing the eight possible numbers. The investigation was broken open when an anonymous tip led to a bar near Philadelphia where the brothers had bought a large number of lottery tickets. An employee remembered the brothers coming into the bar with a platinum-blonde woman and laying down a large amount of cash to buy lottery tickets, all on the eight specific numbers. The employee recalled that while he printed the tickets, one of the brothers made a pay phone call, spoke in a foreign language, and held up the phone so the listener could hear the lottery machine printing the tickets. Investigators pulled the phone records and traced the call to the WTAE-TV announcer's booth in the studio where the drawing was done. This strongly implicated Perry, and Maragos confirmed under questioning that the conversation had been with Perry (in Greek).Perry took lottery fix winnings, court told. The Altoona Mirror. May 16, 1981. Further investigation and questioning of the Maragos brothers eventually implicated the rest of the conspirators. William Moran of Fairmont, West Virginia organized the out-of- state buying of additional lottery tickets for a numbers-running scam. It was later revealed that the Maragos brothers also placed bets on the eight numbers with local bookmakers who had illegal numbers games that used the lottery drawing as the winning result. The brothers also told friends and family which numbers to play. All of this may have contributed to the conspiracy's downfall, with the greater influx of slanted bets. Aftermath A grand jury was assembled and charges were leveled against all seven men. Plevel was convicted and spent two years in prison. Bock, Luman, and Moran pleaded guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. The Maragos brothers avoided jail time by agreeing to testify against Perry. Much of the $1.8 million ($ today) was recovered from the Maragos brothers, as were numerous lottery tickets. Perry was convicted of criminal conspiracy, criminal mischief, theft by deception, rigging a publicly exhibited contest and perjury on May 20, 1981. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. He served two years at State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Camp Hill and spent another year at a halfway house in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Perry remained on parole until March 1989. He held a number of jobs after prison including an unsuccessful attempt to return to broadcasting in the late 1980s. Perry died in Attleboro, Massachusetts on April 22, 2003, having never admitted to any role in the plot. After the scandal, the Pennsylvania Lottery and other drawings began taking greater precautions to guard against rigging. The drawings for the Lottery were moved from WTAE to WHP-TV in the state capital of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on June 29, 1981, on orders of Governor Dick Thornburgh who made the announcement on June 10, 1981, along with the addition of a \\"security chief\\" and background checks on all staff related to the drawings. The Pittsburgh market broadcasting rights were given to KDKA-TV in 1981 as well. In Harrisburg, despite the drawings now being held at PBS affiliate WITF-TV, they air locally on rival station WGAL, which has been a sister station to WTAE since it was acquired by Hearst from Pulitzer in 1999. It would not be until July 1, 2009, that the Lottery would resume airing on WTAE, where the drawings would remain until July 1, 2015 when WPXI took over. Cultural impact The 2000 film Lucky Numbers, starring John Travolta and Lisa Kudrow, was loosely based on Perry's story. In 2006, the Game Show Network aired a documentary in their Anything to Win series about the scandal, complete with anecdotes from former WTAE and KDKA news anchor Don Cannon. The 2013 episode \\"The Good, the Bad, & the Baby\\" from Castles sixth season is loosely based on the scandal. A 2011 season 2 episode of Mysteries at the Museum briefly features the story.

Some examples of similar phenotypes are body size or skin coloration or pigmentation. Assortative mating can increase genetic relatedness within the family and is the inverse of disassortative mating. Disassortative mating (also known as negative assortative mating or heterogamy) means that individuals with dissimilar genotypes or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random mating. Disassortative mating reduces the genetic similarities within the family. Positive assortative mating occurs more frequently than negative assortative mating. In both cases, the nonrandom mating pattern result in a typical deviation from the Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg principle (which states that genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences, such as \\"mate choice\\" in this case).  Causes  Leaf beetle Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of assortative mating. Assortative mating has evolved from a combination of different factors, which vary across different species. Assortative mating with respect to body size can arise as a consequence of intrasexual competition. In some species, size is correlated with fecundity in females. Therefore, males choose to mate with larger females, with the larger males defeating the smaller males in courting them. Examples of species that display this type of assortative mating include the jumping spider Phidippus clarus and the leaf beetle Diaprepes abbreviatus. In other cases, larger females are better equipped to resist male courtship attempts, and only the largest males are able to mate with them. Assortative mating can, at times, arise as a consequence of social competition. Traits in certain individuals may indicate competitive ability which allows them to occupy the best territories. Individuals with similar traits that occupy similar territories are more likely to mate with one another. In this scenario, assortative mating does not necessarily arise from choice, but rather by proximity. This was noted in western bluebirds although there is no definite evidence that this is the major factor resulting in color dependent assortative mating in this species. Different factors may apply simultaneously to result in assortative mating in any given species.  In non-human animals  Japanese common toad Assortative mating in animals has been observed with respect to body size and color. Size-related assortative mating is prevalent across many species of vertebrates and invertebrates. It has been found in the simultaneous hermaphrodites such as the land snail Bradybaena pellucida. One reason for its occurrence can be reciprocal intromission (i.e. both individuals provide both male and female gametes during a single mating) that happens in this species. Therefore, individuals with similar body size pair up with one another to facilitate this exchange. Moreover, it is known that larger individuals in such hermaphroditic species produce more eggs, so mutual mate choice is another factor leading to assortative mating in this species. Evidence for size-related assortative mating has also been found in the mangrove snail, Littoraria ardouiniana and in the Japanese common toad, Bufo japonicus. The second common type of assortative mating occurs with respect to coloration. This type of assortative mating is more common in socially monogamous bird species such as the eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) and western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana). In both species more brightly colored males mated with more brightly colored females and less brightly colored individuals paired with one another. Eastern bluebirds also mate assortatively for territorial aggression due to fierce competition for a limited number of nesting sites with tree swallows. Two highly aggressive individuals are better equipped to protect their nest, encouraging assortative mating between such individuals. Assortative mating with respect to two common color morphs: striped and unstriped also exists in a polymorphic population of eastern red- backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus). Assortative mating is also found in many socially monogamous species of birds. Monogamous species are often involved in bi-parental care of their offspring. Since males are equally invested in the offspring as the mother, both genders are expected to display mate choice, a phenomenon termed as mutual mate choice. Mutual mate choice occurs when both males and females are searching for a mate that will maximize their fitness. In birds, female and male ornamentation can indicate better overall condition or such individuals might have better genes, or be better suited as parents.  In humans  Assortative mating in humans has been widely observed and studied, and can be broken down into two types of human assortative mating. These are * genetic assortative mating (assortative mating with mate choice based on genetic type and phenotypical expression) * and social assortative mating (assortative mating with mate choice based on social, cultural, and other societal factors) Genetic assortative mating is well studied and documented. In 1903 Pearson and colleagues reported strong correlations in height, span of arms, and the length of the left forearm between husband and wife in 1000 couples. Assortative mating with regards to appearance does not end there. Males prefer female faces that resemble their own when provided images of three women, with one image modified to resemble their own. However, the same result does not apply to females selecting male faces. Assortative mating based on genomic similarities plays a role in human marriages in the United States. Spouses are more genetically similar to each other than two randomly chosen individuals. The probability of marriage increases by roughly 15% for every 1-SD increase in genetic similarity. However, some researchers argue that this assortative mating is caused purely by population stratification (the fact that people are more likely to marry within ethnic subgroups such as Swedish-Americans). At the same time, individuals display disassortative mating for genes in the major histocompatibility complex region on chromosome 6. Individuals feel more attracted to odors of individuals who are genetically different in this region. This promotes MHC heterozygosity in the children, making them less vulnerable to pathogens. Apart from humans, disassortative mating with regards to the MHC coding region has been widely studied in mice, and has also been reported to occur in fish. In addition to genetic assortative mating, humans also demonstrate patterns of assortative mating based on sociological factors as well. Sociological assortative mating is typically broken down into three categories, mate choice based on socio-economic status, mate choice based on racial or ethnic background, and mate choice based on religious beliefs. Assortative mating based on socio-economic status is the most broad of these general categories. It includes the tendency of humans to mate within their socio-economic peers, that is, those with similar social standing, job prestige, educational attainment, or economic background as themselves. This type of assortative mating includes the growing tendency in recent years for humans to marry people more like themselves in educational attainment or earned income. This applies across all socio-economic statuses, both rich and poor, in that the rich and well educated tend to marry among themselves, as do the poor and under educated. This is best observed in the fact that, in the United States, matches among those with similar educational attainment were more common than they would have been if couples had matched randomly. Another form of sociological assortative mating is assortative mating based on racial and ethnic background. Mentioned above in the context of the genetically similar preferring to mate with one another, this form of assortative mating can take many varied and complicated forms. While the tendency mentioned above does exist, and people do tend to marry those genetically similar to themselves, especially if within the same racial or ethnic group, this trend can change in various ways. It is common, for example, for the barriers to intermarriage with the general population experienced by a minority population to decrease as the numbers of the minority population increase. This assimilation reduces the prevalence of this form of assortative mating. However, growth of a minority population does not necessarily lead to decreased barriers to intermarriage. This can be seen in the sharp increase in the non-white Hispanic population of the United States in the 1990s and 2000s that correlated with a sharp decrease in the percentage of non-white Hispanics intermarrying with the general population. Religious assortative mating is the tendency of individuals to marry within their own religious group. This tendency is prevalent and observable, and changes according to three main factors. The first of these is the proportion of available spouses in the area who already follow the same religion as the person searching for a mate. Areas where religious beliefs are already similar for most people will always have high degrees of religious inbreeding. The second is the social distance between the intermarrying religious groups, or the physical proximity and social interactivity of these groups. Finally, the third factor is the personal views one holds towards marrying outside of a religion. Those who greatly value adherence to religious tradition may be more likely to be averse to marrying across religious lines. Although not necessarily religious, a good example of humans mating assortatively based on belief structure can be found in the tendency of humans to marry based on levels of charitable giving. Couples show similarities in terms of their contributions to public betterment and charities, and this can be attributed to mate choice based on generosity rather than phenotypic convergence. Assortative mating also seems to be very widespread among people with mental disorders.  Effects  Assortative mating has reproductive consequences. Positive assortative mating increases genetic relatedness within a family, whereas negative assortative mating accomplishes the opposite effect. Either strategy may be employed by the individuals of a species depending upon which strategy maximizes fitness and enables the individuals to maximally pass on their genes to the next generation. For instance, in the case of eastern bluebirds, assortative mating for territorial aggression increases the probability of the parents obtaining and securing a nest site for their offspring. This in turn increases the likelihood of survival of the offspring and consequently fitness of the individuals. In birds whose coloration represents well being and fecundity of the bird, positive assortative mating for color increases the chances of genes being passed on and of the offspring being in good condition. Also, positive assortative mating for behavioral traits allows for more efficient communication between the individuals and they can cooperate better to raise their offspring. On the other hand, mating between individuals of genotypes which are too similar allows for the accumulation of harmful recessive alleles, which can decrease fitness. Such mating between genetically similar individuals is termed inbreeding which can result in the emergence of autosomal recessive disorders. Moreover, assortative mating for aggression in birds can lead to inadequate parental care. An alternate strategy can be disassortative mating, in which one individual is aggressive and guards the nest site while the other individual is more nurturing and fosters the young. This division of labor increases the chances of survival of the offspring. A classic example of this is in the case of the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). This bird exhibits two color morphs ‚Äì white striped and tan striped. In both genders, the white striped birds are more aggressive and territorial whereas tan striped birds are more engaged in providing parental care to their offspring. Therefore, disassortative mating in these birds allows for an efficient division of labor in terms of raising and protecting their offspring. Positive assortative mating is a key element leading to reproductive isolation within a species, which in turn may result speciation in sympatry over time. Sympatric speciation is defined as the evolution of a new species without geographical isolation. Speciation from assortative mating has occurred in the Middle East blind mole rat, cicadas, and the European corn borer. Humans display these genetic results of assortative mating too, just like other animals. What makes humans unique, however, is the human tendency towards seeking mates that are not only similar to us in genetics and in appearances, but those who are similar to us economically, socially, educationally, and culturally. These tendencies toward using sociological characteristic to make determinations about spouse choice has many effects on the lives and livelihoods of those who choose to marry one another, as well as their children and future generations. Within a generation, assortative mating is sometimes cited as a source of inequality, as those who mate assortatively would marry people of similar station to themselves, thus exacerbating their current station. There is debate, however, about whether this growing preference for educational and occupational similarities in spouses is due to increased preferences for these traits, or the shift in workload that occurred as women entered the workforce. This concentration of wealth in families also perpetuates across generations as parents pass their wealth on to their children, with each successive generation inheriting the resources of both of its parents. The combined resources of the parents allow them to give their child a better life growing up, and the combined inheritances from both parents place them at an even greater advantage than they would be with their superior education and childhoods. This has an enormous impact on the development of the social economic structure of a society.  Economics  A related concept of 'assortative matching' has been developed within economics. This relates to efficiencies in production available if workers are evenly matched in their skills or productivity. A consideration of this assortative matching forms the basis of Kremer's 1993 O-ring theory of economic development.

It follows the sound data at the end of the file, unlike the common ID3V2 tags that precede the sound data. This makes expansion easier. APE field names (\\"keys\\") are character strings that may or may not follow a standard, unlike the ID3 tag \\"frames\\" that are identified by standardized 4 byte codes.  Features  APE tags are more similar to Vorbis comments than ID3 tags. Like Vorbis comments, they are unstructured (key, value) pairs. However, unlike Vorbis comments, they do not allow for inter-key ordering. This is because they store a list of values for each key rather than one value per key. APE values can be flagged as text, binary, or external types. This allows tag editing software to avoid incorrectly displaying binary values, such as an image of album cover art, in the form of unreadable text to users. In comparison, Vorbis comments do not have a flagging feature, so binary data cannot be easily stored in them (though this is by design). APEv2 supports Unicode using UTF-8 for values.

APEv2  The Musepack format developer, Frank Klemm, extended the original APE tag format to add a header, allowing APE tags to be at the beginning of files and allowing metadata values to be Unicode rather than simply ASCII. Because of its simplicity and flexibility, APEv2 was adopted by the WavPack and OptimFROG formats as their primary tag format.

Extinction & biogeography of tropical Pacific birds Prehistory The great nineteenth-century naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace explored Nusantara, drawing attention to fundamental biological differences between the Australia-New Guinea region and Southeast Asia. The boundary between the Asian and Australian faunal regions consists of a zone of smaller islands bearing the name of Wallacea, in honor of the co-discoverer of the theory of natural selection. Wallace speculated that the key to understanding these differences would lie in \\"now-submerged lands, uniting islands to continents\\" (1895). We now know that at several intervals during the Pleistocene, the sea surface was 130 metres below the current sea level. At these times New Guinea, Tasmania, the Aru Islands, and some smaller islands were joined to the Australian mainland. Biogeographers call this enlarged Greater Australian continent Sahul (Ballard, 1993) or Meganesia. West of Wallacea, the vast Sunda Shelf was also exposed as dry land, greatly extending the Southeast Asian mainland to include the Greater Sunda Islands of Sundaland. However, the islands of Wallacea (primarily Sulawesi, Ambon, Ceram, Halmahera and the Lesser Sunda Islands) always remained an island world, imposing a barrier to the dispersal of terrestrial vertebrates, including early hominids. To the north and east of New Guinea, the islands of Near Oceania (the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons) were likewise never connected to Sahul by dry land, for deep-water trenches also separate these from the Australian continental shelf. It seems that human colonization of this region was most likely effected during the interval between 60,000 and 40,000 years ago, although some researchers would push the possible dates earlier. But the key point is that even when the oceans were at their lowest levels, there were always significant open-water gaps between the islands of Wallacea, and therefore, the arrival of humans into Sahul, necessitated over- water transport. This was also the case of the expansion of humans beyond New Guinea into the archipelagoes of Near Oceania. Herein lies one of the most exciting and intriguing aspects of Pacific prehistory: that we are likely dealing with the earliest purposive voyaging in human history. :The settlement of Manus ‚Äî in the Admiralty Islands ‚Äî may represent a real threshold in voyaging ability as it is the only island settled in the Pleistocene beyond the range of one-way intervisibilty. Voyaging to Manus involved a blind crossing of some 60-90 km in a 200-300 km voyage, when no land would have been visible whether coming from the north coast of Sahul or New Hanover at the northern end of New Ireland. These would have been tense hours or days on board that first voyage and the name of Pleistocene Columbus who led this crew will never been known. The target arcs for Manus are 15¬∞ from New Hanover, 17¬∞ from Mussau and 28¬∞ from New Guinea. (Matthew Spriggs, The Island Melanesians, Oxford: Blackwell, 1997) History of the Term The terms Remote Oceania and Near Oceania were proposed by anthropologists Roger Green and Andrew Pawley in 1973. By their definition, Near Oceania consists of New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands, with the exception of Santa Cruz islands Green &Pawley;, 1973, \\"Dating the Dispersal of the Oceanic Languages\\". They are designed to dispel the outdated categories of Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia; Near Oceania cuts right across the old category of Melanesia, which has shown to be not a useful category in respect to the geography, culture, language and human history of the region. The old categories have been in use since they were proposed by French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville in the mid- 19th century. Though the push of some people in academia has been to replace the categories with Green's terms since the early 1990s, the old categories are still used in science, popular culture and general usage.

It was fought on 18‚Äì19 June 1815 between the Prussian rearguard, consisting of the Prussian III Corps under the command of General Johann von Thielmann (whose chief-of-staff was Carl von Clausewitz) and three corps of the French army under the command of Marshal Grouchy. A blocking action, this battle kept 33,000 French soldiers from reaching the Battle of Waterloo and so helped in the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. Background Following defeat at the Battle of Ligny two days earlier, the Prussian army retreated north in good order and formed up at Wavre. Wellington's Anglo-allied army held at Quatre Bras, but had to retreat northwards, to a defensive position at Waterloo. Napoleon moved the bulk of his army off in pursuit of Wellington, and sent Grouchy in pursuit of the retreating Prussians with the right wing (aile droite) of the Army of the North (L'Arm√©e du Nord), a force consisting of 33,000 men and 80 guns. The French units in the order of battle were:The figures given for unit strengths in the order of battle are not accurate for the battle of Wavre and are, in fact, impossibly precise for any such military action given the inevitable effects of any battlefield's confusion and the \\"fog of war.\\" Both forces had been engaged and suffered casualties at the battle of Ligny, and some 8,000 men of the Prussian army had become stragglers during the retreat from Ligny. There would also be a number of men not at the battle for other reasons, although as the campaign had only just started, there would have been little of the usual attrition due to sickness so common to field armies during the Napoleonic wars. *III Corps (General Dominique Vandamme) **17,099 infantry ‚Äì 38 guns *IV Corps (General √âtienne Maurice G√©rard) **15,013 infantry ‚Äì 38 guns *II Cavalry Corps (General Remy Exelmans) **3,392 infantry ‚Äì 12 guns *IV (Hussars) Cavalry Division (General Pierre Soult) **1,485 infantry ‚Äì 8 guns detached from the I Cavalry Corps **5,000 cavalry from the Reserve Army Grouchy was slow in taking up the pursuit after Ligny, which allowed Prince Bl√ºcher to fall back largely unmolested to Wavre, regroup his army, and then execute a flank march with three of his four corps to join up with Wellington's Anglo-allied army at Waterloo. The remaining corps, the III Prussian Corps (Thielmann's) of 17,000 men and 48 guns, was to follow the other three corps leaving a small rearguard in Wavre, unless the French appeared in force in which case he was to oppose any French attempt to close on the main body of the Prussian army. Prelude French positions Marshal Grouchy was in Gembloux with III Corps commanded by General Vandamme and IV Corps commanded by General Gerard. The 4th Cavalry Division, commanded by Pajol, and the 21st infantry division, under Teste (from Lobau's corps), formed the remainder of his force. Reconnaissance by Pajol's horsemen during the 17th of June found that the Prussians had left Namur. French movements The Dyle river in Wavre (early 20th century). At around 06:00 of 18 June 1815 Grouchy reported to Napoleon that the Prussians had left Tourinnes by marching all night. He further reported that he was moving on Wavre with all haste. At 10:00 Grouchy reported to Napoleon that the Prussian I, II, and‚Äîmistakenly‚ÄîIII CorpsIn fact the Prussian force that marched to Waterloo comprised I, II, and IV Corps. Thielmann's III Corps was the force opposing Grouchy at Wavre. were marching in the direction of Brussels, and that Prussian officers were talking of joining Wellington to offer battle to the French army. His despatch included a Prussian requisition form by way of proof. He suggested that by attacking and standing at Wavre, he could block the Prussians from intervening against the rest of the French army. At 11:30, Grouchy and his corps commanders heard in the distance the noise from the Grand Battery as the Battle of Waterloo started. Grouchy's corps commanders, especially G√©rard, suggested that they should \\"march to the sound of the guns.\\" Grouchy, however, had written and verbal orders from Napoleon to march on Wavre and to engage the Prussians there, and knew that Marshal Ney had been taken to task by Napoleon two days earlier for not following orders at the Battle of Quatre Bras. Grouchy therefore declined to follow his subordinates' suggestion, pointing out that Napoleon had more than enough force to deal with Wellington. Minutes after this conversation, Exelmans reported strong Prussian positions at Wavre. At 13:00, elements of Exelmans' cavalry were in contact with the Prussian 14th Brigade‚Äôs rear guard. Further argument was ended by the arrival at 16:00 of another order from Napoleon, repeating the instruction to Grouchy to attack the Prussians before him. Prussian movements Bl√ºcher had ordered Thielmann to defend the position of Wavre in the event of Marshal Grouchy advancing in force, or, if otherwise, to follow the main Prussian army in the direction of Couture-Saint-Germain and the battlefield of Waterloo. Thielmann was on the point of leaving Wavre to march towards Couture-Saint- Germain when the French III Corps (Vandamme's) arrived in front of his position, at about 16:00, and the French artillery immediately opened a cannonade upon the Prussians. All the brigades (the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) of the Prussian III Corps (Thielmann's), had, at that time, received the order to commence the general movement to the right (west). A detachment of only two battalions (the Fusilier Battalions of the 30th Regiment and of the 1st Kurmark Landwehr), under Colonel Zepelin, from the 9th Brigade, which had not yet crossed the river Dyle, was to be left in occupation of Wavre. The 12th Brigade was already in full line of march, and the 11th had just been put in motion. When General Borcke, who commanded the 9th Brigade, fell back upon Wavre for the purpose of carrying out his instructions, he found the bridge already barricaded, and therefore proceeded with his brigade to Basse-Wavre (a short distance east and down-stream of Wavre). Having crossed the Dyle at this point, he left a detachment there, consisting of the sharpshooters of the Fusilier Battalion of the 8th Regiment and those of the 1st Battalion of the 30th Regiment, under Major Ditfurth, whom he directed to destroy the bridge immediately. He then detached the 2nd Battalion of the 30th Regiment and his two squadrons of the Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry, as a reinforcement to Zepelin at Wavre. With the remainder of his brigade, he then continued his march. In the meantime, French Tirailleurs were observed extending along the opposite heights, and in their rear considerable masses of French troops appeared to be advancing. It soon became manifest to the Prussians that the French contemplated forcing a passage of the river. Prussian preparations and dispositions Thielmann, judging by the want of vigour displayed in the French pursuit and by the French not having attempted to secure the passage of the Dyle at Mousty, , and Limal, considered that it was only a weak detachment that was advancing upon Wavre, confining itself to the design of creating some little uneasiness by its movement along this road to Brussels. He had hitherto been of the opinion that the occupation of Wavre by a few battalions, as directed by Bl√ºcher, would be quite sufficient, but he now plainly saw that a moment had arrived which required him, in pursuance of his instructions, to maintain the position at Wavre. Accordingly, he ordered the halt of his whole corps for this purpose. The town of Wavre is situated on the left (north) bank of the Dyle, having a suburb on the opposite side of the river, with which it was then connected by two stone bridges. The principal of these bridges led towards the middle, and the smaller one towards the upper end of the town. Higher up the stream, at the Mill of Bierges, at Limal, and at Limelette. Below the town at Basse-Wavre, there were wooden bridges. The river Dyle is not deep, but because of the very heavy rain over the previous 24 hours it was swollen. The low range of heights on either side of the valley was covered in many places with woods. The heights on the right bank are generally more elevated, but those on the left have steeper declivities, and offer a greater command of the river and its passages. The shortest road from Namur to Brussels passed through the town, besides which there were numerous crossroads practicable for the movement of all arms. The great number of hollow ways forms a prominent feature in the vicinity, and these, being in a miry state from the rain, were unfavourable to the progress of troops passing through them. The position was thus occupied: *the 12th Brigade (Colonel St√ºlpnagel), with the Horse Battery No. 20, was posted on the height in rear of Bierge. The bridge in front of this village was barricaded, and the Mill occupied for the defence of the bridge. *The 10th Brigade (Colonel K√§mpfen) stood upon the heights in the rear of Wavre, its right resting on a wood which lay between it and the 12th Brigade. *The 11th Brigade (Colonel Luce) was formed across the Brussels road. *The reserve cavalry was drawn up, near , in columns of squadrons. *The artillery was distributed along the heights. Horse Battery No. 18 remained in reserve. That suburb of the town of Wavre which lies on the right (i.e., the south) bank was occupied by light troops only. The great bridge was barricaded as well as time and circumstances would admit. The houses adjoining the left bank of the river were hastily loopholed. The smaller bridge was left perfectly open. A detachment of two companies of light infantry, under Major Bornstadt was detached to reinforce the troops at the bridge at Basse-Wavre. Thielmann intended that the 9th Brigade should be posted in rear of this general disposition of his troops, so that its services might be made available according as circumstances might require; but through some misunderstanding in the transmission of the order, General Borcke was induced, after having moved along the Brussels road until near La Bawette, thence to turn off to his left, and continue his march, according to his original instructions in the direction of Froidmont, Bourgeois, and Saint- Lambert, towards Couture-Saint-Germain; being under the impression that the whole corps had already commenced this march, in pursuance of the general plan, and that his brigade was destined to cover the movement. The departure of the Brigade was not immediately discovered. Through this misunderstanding, Thielmann's force suffered an unexpected reduction of six battalions and Foot Battery No. 18; and consisted, therefore, of only 15,200 men, with which number he had now to contend against Marshal Grouchy's force, amounting altogether to 33,765 men. In the opinion of William Siborne a contemporary British historian, Thielmann's position was certainly a very favourable one, and the occupation of it was arranged with great skill. It was impossible to foresee in what manner the attack upon it would be conducted‚Äîwhether it would be directed against one particular bridge, or against all the bridges, with the design of carrying the whole Line by storm. Thielmann therefore limited the occupation of the town and of the line of the river to the number of light troops that might be sufficient for sustaining any sudden assault, taking care to have support close at hand for that purpose. However, he placed his reserves, which comprised his main force, so that they might become available at any point which might be pressed. Should the French develop greatly superior numbers, as was subsequently the case, that would serve to guard against any flank attack. Battle Commemorative plaque to the 1815 battle, Dyle bridge, Wavre. Plaque at the St. John-the-Baptist church, Wavre Late in the afternoon of 18 June, as Napoleon was heavily engaged against Wellington at Waterloo, Grouchy, commanding the corps of General G√©rard and General Vandamme, prepared to attack the Prussian forces confronting him over the River Dyle between the towns of Wavre and Limal. General Vandamme opened the Battle of Wavre at 16:00, unlimbering 3 batteries, then moved Habert's division in an attempt to take the bridges by quick assault. Marshal Grouchy, having just received Marshal Soult's order to move against Wavre, ordered Exelmans' cavalry with an infantry battalion against the bridge at Bas-Wavre while Lefol's division moved against the bridge at Bierges. The fusilier battalion of the 1st Kurmark Landwehr Regiment defended the Bierge bridge by removing timbers from it under French fire and counter-charging any attempt to repair it. The Kurmarkers held the right bank of the stone bridge at Wavre for some time, forcing Vandamme's troops to waste precious time taking it. Once this was done the French rushed across the bridge and straight into a vicious street fight. A battalion of the 2nd Kurmark Landwehr Regiment moved to support the 1st and threw the French back across the bridge. A renewed French assault penetrated further down the same street, only to be ambushed from side streets by the fusiliers of the 1st Kurmark Landwehr and 30th Line Infantry Regiments using point blank musketry. A bayonet charge sent the French scrambling across the bridge again. This see-saw battle would continue throughout the night. Later attacks by the French upon Wavre met with no more success. The Prussians assigned another battalion and three guns to the bridge. The bridge at Bas-Wavre had been destroyed by the Prussians. The attacks by Lefol upon the bridge of Bierges had no more success, being hampered by muddy ground and the tough defense of the Prussian 31st Line Infantry Regiment supported by the 2nd battalion of the 6th Kurmark Landwehr Regiment and a horse battery. Three small battalions and three squadrons of cavalry under Stengel were to guard a bridge to the west at Limal. Marshal Soult's 13:00 letter ordering Grouchy to move quickly to join Napoleon and to attack B√ºlow arrived after 18:00. Grouchy at once began gathering additional divisions and headed to Limal, arriving at 23:00, where he found that Pajol's cavalry had forced the bridge there. Prussian scouting cavalry noticed the strong French columns moving to Limal and the Prussian 12th Brigade moved covering forces to the area. The Prussians made a bayonet charge in an attempt to retake Limal, but without success. Night closed the major actions of the battle of Wavre, although outposts fired on each other all night. At approximately 20:00 the French attack at Waterloo was irrevocably lost as its left, center, and right collapsed within a few minutes of each other. Grouchy was by then across the Dyle, but meanwhile the remnants of the Armƒóe du Nord were streaming south towards the imagined safety of French territory. Fighting renewed in the early hours. The forest south of Limal was forced by 09:00. Thielmann then elected to retreat as the campaign had been decided by the fighting elsewhere. The definitive report of the victory at Waterloo reached Thielmann at 10:00 as his retreat started. Grouchy, watching the Prussian retreat, was beginning his planned move upon Brussels when the news reached him at 10:30 that Napoleon had been defeated. Though in shock, Grouchy realised he was in danger of being trapped and his entire command destroyed. He at once had Exelmans move his cavalry to secure the bridges and began a retreat by forced marches that would take him back to Paris. The victorious French forces had held the battlefield for only 30 minutes. Conclusion While the battle ended in a French victory, with the Prussians in retreat and Grouchy firmly athwart Prussian lines of communication to the east, this victory proved hollow. The Prussians had held their ground long enough to allow Bl√ºcher's transfer of 72,000 troops to Wellington‚Äôs aid at Waterloo. In addition, the Prussian rearguard of 17,000 troops had tied down 33,000 French troops that could have otherwise taken part at Waterloo. Thus, for the Prussians, the battle was a strategic success, as it contributed to the decisive victory at Waterloo.

It is called \\"mixed\\" because it can be seen as a conceptual \\"mixture\\" of competitive inhibition, in which the inhibitor can only bind the enzyme if the substrate has not already bound, and uncompetitive inhibition, in which the inhibitor can only bind the enzyme if the substrate has already bound. If the ability of the inhibitor to bind the enzyme is exactly the same whether or not the enzyme has already bound the substrate, it is known as a non-competitive inhibitor. Non-competitive inhibition is sometimes thought of as a special case of mixed inhibition. In mixed inhibition, the inhibitor binds to an allosteric site, i.e. a site different from the active site where the substrate binds. However, not all inhibitors that bind at allosteric sites are mixed inhibitors. Mixed inhibition may result in either: * A decrease in the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the substrate (Km value appears to increase; K_m^\\\\text{app} > K_m) -- seen in cases where the inhibitor favours binding to the free enzyme. More closely mimics competitive binding. * An increase in the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the substrate (Km value appears to decrease; K_m^\\\\text{app} < K_m) -- seen in cases where the inhibitor favours binding to the enzyme- substrate complex. More closely mimics uncompetitive binding. In either case the inhibition decreases the apparent maximum enzyme reaction rate (V_{max}^\\\\text{app} < V_{max}). Mathematically, mixed inhibition occurs when the factors Œ± and Œ±‚Äô (introduced into the Michaelis-Menten equation to account for competitive and uncompetitive inhibition, respectively) are both greater than 1. In the special case where Œ± = Œ±‚Äô, noncompetitive inhibition occurs, in which case V_{max}^{app} is reduced but K_m is unaffected. This is very unusual in practice.  Biological examples  In gluconeogenesis, the enzyme cPEPCK (cystolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) is responsible for converting oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvic acid, or PEP, when guanosine triphosphate, GTP, is present. This step is exclusive for gluconeogenesis, which occurs under fasting condition's due to the body's depletion of glucose. cPEPCK is known to be regulated by Genistein, an isoflavone that is naturally found in a number of plants. It was first proven that genistein inhibits the activity of cPEPCK. In a study, the presence of this isoflavone resulted in a decrease in the level of blood sugar. A lowered blood sugar level means less glucose is in the blood. If this occurs in a subject that is fasting, this is because the gluconeogenesis was inhibited, preventing increased production of glucose. The ability of genistein to lower a person's blood sugar level allows it to be referred to as an anti-diabetic property. The mechanism in which genistein inhibited the enzyme cPEPCK was further evaluated. First, cPEPCK was placed in the presence of 3-Mercaptopropionic acid, or 3-MPA, a known inhibitor of the enzyme. It was compared to the results of placing cPEPCK in the presence of genistein, which revealed that the mechanism of mixed inhibition was used to decrease cPEPCK's activity. cPEPCK undergoes multiple configurations when catalyzing the formation of PEP. It can be either unbound, bound to GDP or bound to GTP. An experiment that studied the affinity for genistein in these different configurations was conducted. It revealed that geinstein favors binding to the cPEPCK with a bound GTP than then the enzyme with a bound GDP, which was found to be less stable. This was because the GTP- bound cPEPCK revealed an extended binding site for genistein. This is the same binding site as the enzyme's intended substrate, oxaloacetate while the other configurations did not do so in the presence of genistein. This provided evidence that the mechanism of inhibition of cPEPCK by genistein was a mixture of competitive and non-competitive inhibition. A kallikrein is a type of serine protease, which cleaves peptide bonds after certain amino acids in a protein. These 15 kallikreins, KLK1 to KLK15, are found in human tissues. The ability for this molecule to cleave proteins results in the effective activation of cell surface receptors, making them crucial elements of many biological signal transduction pathways, and its amplification through cascades. This family of serine proteases is often a biomarker to diseases, and therefore, have become a target for inhibition. Inhibition of these kallikreins results in possible therapy for diseases such as metastatic cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Fukugetin, or (+)-morelloflavone, is a type of plant biflavonoid isolated from Garcinia brasiliensis. After isolating fukugetin, it was placed with KLK1, KLK2, KLK3, KLK4, KLK5, KLK6, and KLK7 in varying concentrations. This allowed for the analysis of enzyme kinetics through derivation of parameters Km and Vmax. Through the model of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the Eadie-Hofstee diagram was plotted. It confirmed that fukugetin acts as a mixed inhibitor by exhibiting varying but present affinities for the enzyme alone and the enzyme-substrate complex. Analyzing through kinetics, fukugetin decreased the Vmax while it increased the Km for these KLKs. Typically, in competitive inhibition, Vmax remains the same while Km increases, and in non-competitive inhibition, Vmax decreases while Km remains the same. The change in both of these variables is another finding consistent with the effects of a mixed inhibitor.

Dragonet (SS-293) was launched 18 April 1943 by Cramp Shipbuilding Co., Philadelphia; sponsored by Mrs. J. E. Gingrich; and commissioned 6 March 1944, Commander Jack Hayden Lewis in command. Dragonet was depth charged during a series of controlled tests in April, May and June 1944 off Portsmouth, New Hampshire.http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/WDR/WDR58/WDR58-18.html Dragonet reached Pearl Harbor from New London 9 October 1944, and put out on her first war patrol 1 November, bound for the Kurile Islands and the Sea of Okhotsk. On the morning of 15 December 1944, while submerged south of Matsuwa, Dragonet struck an uncharted submerged pinnacle, which holed her pressure hull in the forward torpedo room. The space was completely flooded, and in order to surface the submarine, it was necessary to blow water out of the compartment with compressed air. At 0845 she surfaced, just from the airfield on Matsuwa, and set course to clear the danger area as quickly as possible. Her bow planes were rigged out, and in order to rerig them, it would be necessary to enter the flooded compartment. Next day this was accomplished by putting pressure in the forward battery compartment, and opening the water-tight door into the forward torpedo room. The determination and skill of her crew were further tried when she had to run through two days of storm to reach Midway 20 December for emergency repairs. After overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, CA., Dragonet returned to Pearl Harbor 2 April 1945, and sailed on her next patrol 19 April. She called at Guam to refuel from 1 May to 3 May, then proceeded to lifeguard duty south of the Japanese home islands. She rescued four downed Army aviators during this patrol, and returned to refit at Guam between 10 June and 8 July. Dragonet's third war patrol, between 8 July 1945 and 17 August, was a combination of lifeguard duty and offensive against Japanese shipping in Bungo Suido. At this late stage in the war, the remnants of the Japanese merchant marine provided few targets, and none was contacted by Dragonet. She rescued a downed naval aviator near Okino Shima. Putting into Saipan at the close of the war, she sailed on to Pearl Harbor and San Francisco. Dragonet was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Mare Island 16 April 1946, and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was struck from the Naval Register 1 June 1961, and sunk by explosive test in Chesapeake Bay. Dragonet's second and third war patrols were designated as \\"successful\\". She received two battle stars for World War II service. Norfolk in 1961.

The company owns 69 public houses, with 23 situated in Boston alone. The brewery focuses on cask conditioned ales, their best known being XB and XXXB. Their slogan is \\"Good Honest Ales\\". Early history Batemans was founded in 1874 by George Bateman, a local farmer who sold his farm in nearby Friskney in order to rent a brewery in Wainfleet, situated by the railway. He bought the brewery equipment for ¬£505 10s (roughly equivalent to ¬£30,000 today); a year later he bought the lease for ¬£800. Before he retired, Edwin Crowe, from whom Bateman had bought his equipment, passed on his knowledge of the craft to George and his wife Suzanna (who had had a little experience of home brewing). Crowe's expert brewer stayed on with Bateman for some years, despite his blindness. In 1880 Bateman had earned enough from the business to buy Salem House, a Georgian building some 200 yards from the original brewery, and a new brewery was built in its coach houses. In addition to the brewing, Bateman bottled spirits, and his wife baked bread for sale. > \\"On Fair Day, which was held twice a year, the farmers would come to Salem > House to pay for the beer their workers had consumed the previous six > months. It was very common for this payment to not be paid in cash, but with > meat and potatoes. Once payment had been made, we would invite the farmers > into our kitchen for a massive feast. This tradition continued until > 1930.\\"Batemans' Web site (retrieved 29 January 2007) By 1910 the company was engaged in the bottling of Guinness and Bass for its estate. Bateman's son, Harry, went into the business, which he bought from his father in 1919. The 1920s and 1930s proved to be a very lean time for the industry, partly because of severe restrictions on brewing that had come in during World War I, partly because of higher taxes, and a consequent decrease in sales. At one point Bateman had to lay off his entire workforce, but their resulting plight made him take them back; in order to find work for them, he expanded the business into building opposite Salem House -- including a derelict windmill which was to become the brewery's trademark. By 1948 the tied estate had grown to 68 pubs. Mild ale was the principal product during the 1950s. From 1970 until 1992 the brewery ran a line for the production of keg beers.november-1992.pdf The company's XXXB beer was introduced on 1 February 1978. During the 1980s the company faced a difficult decision: half of the family wanted to sell up and half wanted to continue brewing. Chairman George Bateman, his wife Pat and their children Stuart and Jaclyn saved up enough money to buy out the family members who wanted to sell, and the company lived on. The pub business On his twenty-first birthday, Harry Bateman had been given a pub by his father; in the 1920s he began to expand upon that beginning, and bought a group of pubs generally thought to be worthless. This chain was expanded in 1927 by the purchase of the Vine Hotel in Skegness, and in 1935 by the building of the County Hotel in the same town. In 1957, when Batemans already owned a chain of seventy pubs, they bought another twenty- nine, mostly run-down pubs to the north of Boston, as well as some in the town itself. It took eight years to renovate and obtain licences for them (at the time, a pub could not have a licence unless it had at least two rooms). Batemans beers are now available from pubs throughout the UK, but especially within Lincolnshire and neighbouring counties.

Warfare in the Ancient Near East, pp. 66‚Äì71. A typical khopesh is 50‚Äì60 cm (20‚Äì24 inches) in length, though smaller examples also exist. The inside curve of the weapon could be used to trap an opponent's arm, or to pull an opponent's shield out of the way. These weapons changed from bronze to iron in the New Kingdom period. The earliest known depiction of a khopesh is from the Stele of Vultures, depicting King Eannatum of Lagash wielding the weapon; this would date the khopesh to at least 2500 BC. The word khopesh may have been derived from \\"leg\\", as in \\"leg of beef\\", because of their similarity in shape. The hieroglyph for ·∏´p≈° ('leg') is found as early as during the time of the Coffin Texts (the First Intermediate Period).Coffin Texts: CT V, 9c, B1C The blade is only sharpened on the outside portion of the curved end. The khopesh evolved from the epsilon or similar crescent-shaped axes that were used in warfare. The khopesh fell out of use around 1300 BC. However, in the 196 BC Rosetta Stone, it is referenced as the \\"sword\\" determinative in a hieroglyphic block, with the spelled letters of kh, p, and sh to say: Various pharaohs are depicted with a khopesh, and some have been found in royal graves, such as the two examples found with Tutankhamun. Although some examples have clearly sharpened edges, many examples have dull edges that apparently were never intended to be sharp. It may therefore be possible that some khopeshes found in high-status graves were ceremonial variants.

For the history of al-Arabi, we must rely on the Muslim historian Abu al-Hassan Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad (1160-1233), also known as Ali ‚Äòizz ad-Din ibn al- Athir al-Jazari (ibn al-Athir), who wrote four centuries after the fact. When the Abbasid governor Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Siqlabi landed near Murcia sometime before 777, he sent an invitation to al-Arabi to join him, but the governor of Barcelona refused. Al-Siqlabi then marched on Barcelona, but was defeated near Valencia.Roger Collins, The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710‚Äì797 (Basil Blackwell, 1989), pp. 174‚Äì177. According to ibn al-Athir, threatened by Abd ar-Rahman I, the Umayyad emir of C√≥rdoba, al-Arabi sent a delegation to Charlemagne in Paderborn, offering his submission, together with the allegiance of Husayn of Zaragoza and Abu Taur of Huesca in return for military aid. As a result, Charlemagne marched across the Pyrenees toward Zaragoza in 778, joined by troops led by Sulayman. Husayn of Zaragoza, however, refused to surrender the city, claiming that he had never promised Charlemagne his allegiance. After a month of siege Charlemagne decided to return to his kingdom, taking some hostages from his Muslim allies including Sulayman. On his retreat, Charlemagne suffered an attack from the Basques in central Navarra. As a reprisal he attacked Pamplona, conquering it. However, on his retreat north his baggage train was ambushed at Roncesvalles August 15, 778. The children of Sulayman, Aysun al-Arabi and Matruh al-Arabi collaborated with the Basques in the assault which resulted in the release of their father. Sulayman returned to Zaragoza where, in 780, he was killed by his former friend and ally Husayn of Zaragoza. These historical events are assumed to be part of the factual nucleus around which was eventually formed, by centuries of oral tradition on the Christian side, The Song of Roland, which was to have an immense importance in the Medieval culture of France and the whole of Christian Western Europe. It did not, however, make a comparable deep and lasting impression on the Muslim side.

The illness is caused by a neurotoxin produced in the tick's salivary gland. After prolonged attachment, the engorged tick transmits the toxin to its host. The incidence of tick paralysis is unknown. Patients can experience severe respiratory distress (similar to anaphylaxis). Signs and symptoms Tick paralysis results from injection of a toxin from tick salivary glands during a blood meal. The toxin causes symptoms within 2‚Äì7 days, beginning with weakness in both legs that progresses to paralysis. The paralysis ascends to the trunk, arms, and head within hours and may lead to respiratory failure and death. The disease can present as acute ataxia without muscle weakness. Patients may report minor sensory symptoms, such as local numbness, but constitutional signs are usually absent. Deep tendon reflexes are usually decreased or absent, and ophthalmoplegia and bulbar palsy can occur. Electromyographic (EMG) studies usually show a variable reduction in the amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, but no abnormalities of repetitive nerve stimulation studies. These appear to result from a failure of acetylcholine release at the motor nerve terminal level. There may be subtle abnormalities of motor nerve conduction velocity and sensory action potentials. Pathogenesis Tick paralysis is believed to be due to toxins found in the tick's saliva that enter the bloodstream while the tick is feeding. The two ticks most commonly associated with North American tick paralysis are the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni) and the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis); however, 43 tick species have been implicated in human disease around the world. Most North American cases of tick paralysis occur from April to June, when adult Dermacentor ticks emerge from hibernation and actively seek hosts. In Australia, tick paralysis is caused by the tick Ixodes holocyclus. Prior to 1989, 20 fatal cases were reported in Australia. Although tick paralysis is of concern in domestic animals and livestock in the United States as well, human cases are rare and usually occur in children under the age of 10. Tick paralysis occurs when an engorged and gravid (egg-laden) female tick produces a neurotoxin in its salivary glands and transmits it to its host during feeding. Experiments have indicated that the greatest amount of toxin is produced between the fifth and seventh day of attachment (often initiating or increasing the severity of symptoms), although the timing may vary depending on the species of tick. Unlike Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis, which are caused by the systemic proliferation and expansion of parasites in their hosts long after the offending tick is gone, tick paralysis is chemically induced by the tick and therefore usually only continues in its presence. Once the tick is removed, symptoms usually diminish rapidly. However, in some cases, profound paralysis can develop and even become fatal before anyone becomes aware of a tick's presence. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on symptoms and upon finding an embedded tick, usually on the scalp. In the absence of a tick, the differential diagnosis includes Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome. Early signs of tick poisoning could be a change of an animals' ‚Äòvoice‚Äô, weakness in the back legs or vomiting. Prevention No human vaccine is currently available for any tick-borne disease, except for tick-borne encephalitis. Individuals should therefore take precautions when entering tick-infested areas, particularly in the spring and summer months. Preventive measures include avoiding trails that are overgrown with bushy vegetation, wearing light-coloured clothes that allow one to see the ticks more easily, and wearing long pants and closed-toe shoes. Tick repellents containing DEET (N,N, diethyl-m-toluamide) are only marginally effective and can be applied to skin or clothing. Rarely, severe reactions can occur in some people who use DEET-containing products. Young children may be especially vulnerable to these adverse effects. Permethrin, which can only be applied to clothing, is much more effective in preventing tick bites. Permethrin is not a repellent but rather an insecticide; it causes ticks to curl up and fall off the protected clothing. Treatment Removal of the offending tick usually results in resolution of symptoms within several hours to days. If the tick is not removed, the toxin can be fatal. A 1969 study of children reported mortality rates of 10 ‚Äì 12 percent, mostly due to respiratory paralysis. The tick is best removed by grasping it as close to the skin as possible and pulling in a firm steady manner. Because the toxin lies in the tick's salivary glands, care must be taken to remove the entire tick (including the head), or symptoms may persist. It is important to note that, unlike the toxin of other tick species, the toxin of Ixodes holocyclus (Australian paralysis tick) may still be fatal even if the tick is removed. For affected animals, food and water intake can worsen the outcome, as the toxin can prevent the animal from swallowing properly. If you find a tick on your animal, remove it immediately and seek veterinary assistance if the animal shows any signs of illness. The tick can be placed in a tightly sealed plastic bag and taken to a veterinarian for identification. Research Although several attempts have been made to isolate and identify the neurotoxin since the first isolation in 1966, the exact structure of the toxin has still not been published. The 40-80 kDa protein fraction contains the toxin. The neurotoxin structure and gene, at least for the tick species Ixodes holocyclus have since been identified and are called holocyclotoxins after the species. At least three members (HT-1, HT-3, and HT-12) trigger paralysis by presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release via a calcium dependent mechanism resulting in a reduction of quantal content, and loss of effective neuromuscular synaptic transmission.

It was started in response to an interview where Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the Black Panther Party, was asked what white people could do to support the Black Panthers. Newton replied that they could form a White Panther Party. The counterculture era group took the name and dedicated its energies to \\"cultural revolution.\\" John Sinclair made every effort to ensure that the White Panthers were not mistaken for a white supremacist group, responding to such claims with \\"quite the contrary.\\" The party worked with many ethnic minority rights groups in the Rainbow Coalition.  Michigan years  The group was most active in Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan and included the proto-punk band MC5 which John Sinclair managed for several years before he was incarcerated. From a general ideological perspective, Plamondon and Sinclair defined the White Panthers as \\"fighting for a clean planet and the freeing of political prisoners.\\" The White Panthers added other elements such as advocating \\"rock 'n roll, dope, sex in the streets and the abolishing of capitalism.\\" Yippie co-founder Abbie Hoffman praised the WPP in Steal This Book and Woodstock Nation, and John Sinclair often referred to himself as a Yippie as well. The group emerged from the Detroit Artists Workshop, a radical arts collective founded in 1964 near Wayne State University. Among its concerns was the legalization of marijuana; John Sinclair had several arrests for possession. It aligned itself with radical politics, claiming the 12th Street Riot was justifiable under political and economic conditions in Detroit. Plamondon was indicted with John Sinclair in connection to the bombing of a Central Intelligence Agency office in Ann Arbor on September 29, 1968, a year after the founding of the group. Upon hearing on the left-wing alternative radio station WABX that he had been indicted, he fled the U.S. for Europe and Africa, spending time in Algeria with exiled Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver. After secretly re-entering the country, and on his way to a safe house in northern Michigan, he was arrested in a routine traffic stop, joining John Sinclair, who had been sentenced to nine and a half years in jail for violating Michigan's marijuana possession laws, in prison. Plamondon was convicted and was in prison when Sinclair was released on bond in 1971 while appeals were being heard on his case. Sinclair's unexpected release came two days after a large \\"Free John\\" benefit concert, with performances from John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Bob Seger, and Stevie Wonder, was held at the University of Michigan's Crisler Arena.  Legal reforms  The group had a direct role in two important legal decisions. A landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1972 quashed Plamondon's conviction and destroyed the case against John Sinclair. The court ruled warrantless wiretapping was unlawful under the U.S. Constitution, even in the case where national security, as defined by the executive branch, was in danger. The White Panthers had been charged with conspiring to destroy government property and evidence used to convict Plamondon was acquired through wiretaps not submitted to judicial approval. The case U.S. vs. U.S. District Court (Plamondon et al.), 407 U.S. 297, commonly known as the Keith Case, held that the Fourth Amendment shielded private speech from surveillance unless a warrant had been granted, and that the \\"warrant procedure would not frustrate the legitimate purposes of domestic security searches.\\" The judgment freed Plamondon, yet John Sinclair was free only on bond fighting his possession conviction. In 1972, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in the People v. Sinclair, 387 Mich. 91, 194 N.W.2d 878 (1972) that Michigan's classification of marijuana was unconstitutional, in effect decriminalizing possession until a new law conforming to the ruling was passed by the Michigan Legislature a week later. Sinclair was freed but the cumulative effects of the imprisonment had marked the end of the White Panther Party in Michigan, which renamed itself the Rainbow People's Party while John Sinclair and Plamondon were in prison. The Rainbow People's Party, headquartered in Ann Arbor, disbanded in 1973.  Portland  The headquarters of the White Panthers in Portland, Oregon were raided by the FBI on December 5, 1970. Two members of the group were arrested and accused of throwing a molotov cocktail through the window of a local Selective Service office. San Francisco White Panther Party chapters in San Francisco, MarinWhite Panthers of Marin, who run one of Marin's food conspiracies from the big, rambling old house they occupy in Corte Madera and Berkeley remained active into the 1980s. The WPP ran a successful 'Food Conspiracy' that provided groceries to about 5,000 Bay Area residents at low cost, due to bulk buying and minimum markup.

File No. 413-74. FILED. In 1984, angry because then-Mayor of San Francisco Dianne Feinstein proposed to ban handguns in the city, the San Francisco White Panthers mounted a successful petition drive that forced Feinstein into a recall election, which she won. Within the next year, a WPP house in the Haight Ashbury district was burned down by the San Francisco Police, and the leaders of the local chapter (Tom Stevens and Terry Phillips) had been jailed after their commune was raided without a warrant, effectively destroying the chapter.  United Kingdom  Author and anarchist Mick Farren, a leader of the United Kingdom Underground, later founded the White Panthers, UK.  White Panther Statement  In November 1968, Fifth Estate published the \\"White Panther State/meant\\". This manifesto, emulating the Black Panthers, ended with a ten-point program: #We want freedom. We want the power for all people to determine our own destinies. #We want justice. We want an immediate and total end to all cultural and political repression of the people by the vicious pig power structure and their mad dog lackies the police, courts and military. We want the end of all police and military violence against the people all over the world right now! #We want a free world economy based on the free exchange of energy and materials and the end of money. #We want free access to all information media and to all technology for all the people. #We want a free educational system, utilizing the best procedures and machinery our modern technology can produce, that will teach each man, woman and child on earth exactly what each needs to know to survive and grow into his or her full human potential. #We want to free all structures from corporate rule and turn the buildings over to the people at once! #We want free time and space for all humans‚Äîdissolve all unnatural boundaries! #We want the freedom of all prisoners held in federal, state, county or city jails and prisons since the so-called legal system in America makes it impossible for any man to obtain a fair and impartial trial by a jury of his peers. #We want the freedom of all people who are held against their will in the conscripted armies of the oppressors throughout the world. #We want free land, free food, free shelter, free clothing, free music, free medical care, free education, free media, EVERYTHING FREE FOR EVERYBODY! The ten-point program and \\"White Panther State/meant\\" were also published in the Ann Arbor Sun, which was a newspaper founded by John Sinclair in November 1968. The newspaper was originally called the Detroit Warren-Forrest Sun before it was changed to the Ann Arbor Sun when Trans-Love Energies moved to Ann Arbor in 1968. The organization, founded by John Sinclair, his wife Leni Arndt Sinclair and artist Gary Grimshaw in 1967, set up shop at 1510 and 1520 Hill St, where the Ann Arbor Sun was produced and edited by the members of the group. On July 28, 1969, the Ann Arbor Sun printed a revised copy of the White Panther's ten-point program. The newspaper was considered to be the mouthpiece for the White Panther Party for quite some time before the newspaper transitioned to an independent publication spreading views on local issues, left-wing politics, music, and arts. Finally in 1976, the publication of the Ann Arbor Sun was suspended indefinitely.

He is known for establishing and developing ethnomethodology as a field of inquiry in sociology. He is probably best known for his classic book, Studies in Ethnomethodology, which was published in 1967, a collection of articles some of which had previously been published. Selections from unpublished materials were later published in two volumes: Seeing Sociologically and Ethnomethodology's Program.Garfinkel, H.

His family was Jewish.Anne Rawls, \\"Harold Garfinkel\\" in George Ritzer (ed.), The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists, John Wiley & Sons (2008), p. 131 His father, a furniture dealer, had hoped his son would follow him into the family business. Although he did help his father out with the family business, Garfinkel decided to also attend college and study accounting at the University of Newark.Ritzer, George. 2011. \\"Ethnomethodology.\\" Pp. 391-415 in Sociological Theory. 8th Ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. At the University of Newark, courses were mainly taught by Columbia graduate students, who brought more theoretical experiences to the classroom. This theoretical approach guided Garfinkel later on in his theories he formed. In the summer following graduation, Garfinkel volunteered at a Quaker work camp in Cornelia, Georgia. This was an eye-opening experience for Garfinkel. He worked with students from diverse backgrounds who demonstrated a wide variety of interests, influencing his decision to later take up sociology as a career.Rawls, Anne Warfield. \\"Harold Garfinkel.\\" In The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists, edited by George Ritzer, 122-53. Oxford, UK: Blackwell, 2003. While volunteering in Georgia, Garfinkel learned about the sociology program at the University of North Carolina. This program specifically focused on public work projects like the one Garfinkel was working on. Garfinkel completed his Masters in 1942 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill after writing his thesis on interracial homicide. Before graduating, he worked under the supervision of his graduate professor, Howard W. Odum. Garfinkel wrote the short story \\"Color Trouble\\" which was first published in the journal, Opportunity, in 1940. \\"Color Trouble\\" discussed the victimization of segregated black women traveling on a bus in Virginia.Doubt, Keith. 1989. \\"Garfinkel Before Ethnomethodology.\\" Pp. 252-253 in The American Sociologist.

With the onset of World War II, he was drafted into the Army Air Corps and served as a trainer at a base in Florida. As the war effort wound down he was transferred to Gulfport, Mississippi, where he met his wife and lifelong partner, Arlene Steinback. Harvard Department of Social Relations After the war, Garfinkel went to study at Harvard and met Talcott Parsons at the newly formed Department of Social Relations at Harvard University. While Parsons studied and emphasized abstract categories and generalizations, Garfinkel's work was more focused on detailed description. \\"What set Garfinkel apart from Parsons's other students and colleagues was his extreme commitment to empirical studies. Rather than ask, for example, what kinds of normative networks are necessary to sustain family structures, Garfinkel would more likely ask: 'What normative networks are there?' or 'Are there any normative networks?'\\"Hilbert, Richard. 1992. The Classical Roots of Ethnomethodology: Durkheim, Weber, and Garfinkel, p. 3. Chapel Hill, NC: The University of North Carolina Press. While Garfinkel continued to earn his degree at Harvard, sociologist, Wilbert E. Moore, invited Garfinkel to work on the Organizational Behavior Project at Princeton University. Garfinkel taught at Princeton University for two years. This brought him in contact with some of the most prominent scholars of the day in the behavioral, informational, and social sciences including: Gregory Bateson, Kenneth Burke, Paul Lazarsfeld, Frederick Mosteller, Philip Selznick, Herbert A. Simon, and John von Neumann.Rawls, Anne Warfield. \\"Editor's Introduction.\\" In Harold Garfinkel's Toward a Sociological Theory of Information , 1-100. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishers, 2008. Garfinkel completed his dissertation, \\"The Perception of the Other: A Study in Social Order,\\" in 1952. After receiving his doctorate from Harvard, Garfinkel was asked to talk at a 1954 American Sociological Association meeting and created the term \\"ethnomethodology.\\" Ethnomethodology became his main focus of study. It is \\"the investigation of the rational properties of indexical expressions and other practical actions as contingent ongoing accomplishments of organized artful practices of everyday life\\"Lemert, C. (2010). Reflexive Properties of Practical Sociology. In Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings (Vol. 4, pp. 439-443). Philadelphia: Westview Press. In 1954 he joined the sociology faculty at UCLA. During the period 1963‚Äì64 he served as a Research Fellow at the Center for the Scientific Study of Suicide.Shneidman, Edwin S., ed. Essays in Self-Destruction . New York: Science House, 1967. Garfinkel spent the '75-'76 school year at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and, in 1979‚Äì1980, was a visiting fellow at Oxford University. In 1995 he was awarded the \\"Cooley-Mead Award\\" from the American Sociological Association for his contributions to the field.Maynard, Douglas. Introduction of Harold Garfinkel for the Cooley-Mead award. Social Psychology Quarterly 59, no. 1 (1996): 1-4. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Nottingham in 1996. He officially retired from UCLA in 1987, though continued as an emeritus professor until his death on April 21, 2011, in Los Angeles, California. Garfinkel's thought Influences Garfinkel was very intrigued by Parsons' study of social order.Allan, Kenneth. 2006. \\"Organizing Ordinary Life: Harold Garfinkel (1917-).\\" Pp. 51‚Äì71 in \\"Contemporary Social and Sociological Theory.\\" Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press. Parsons sought to offer a solution to the problem of social order (i.e., How do we account for the order that we witness in society?) and, in so doing, provide a disciplinary foundation for research in sociology. Drawing on the work of earlier social theorists (Marshall, Pareto, Durkheim, Weber), Parsons postulated that all social action could be understood in terms of an \\"action frame\\" consisting of a fixed number of elements (an agent, a goal or intended end, the circumstances within which the act occurs, and its \\"normative orientation\\").Parsons, Talcott. The Structure of Social Action: A Study in Social Theory with Special Reference to a Group of Recent European Writers. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937. Agents make choices among possible ends, alternative means to these ends, and the normative constraints that might be seen as operative. They conduct themselves, according to Parsons, in a fashion \\"analogous to the scientist whose knowledge is the principal determinant of his action.\\"Parsons, 1937, p. 58. Order, by this view, is not imposed from above, but rather arises from rational choices made by the actor. Parsons sought to develop a theoretical framework for understanding how social order is accomplished through these choices. Ethnomethodology was not designed to supplant the kind of formal analysis recommended by Parsons. Garfinkel stipulated that the two programs are \\"different and unavoidably related.\\"Garfinkel, 1967, 115. Both seek to give accounts of social life, but ask different kinds of questions and formulate quite different sorts of claims. Sociologists operating within the formal program endeavor to produce objective (that is to say, non-indexical) claims similar in scope to those made in the natural sciences. To do so, they must employ theoretical constructs that pre-define the shape of the social world. Unlike Parsons, and other social theorists before and since, Garfinkel's goal was not to articulate yet another explanatory system. He expressed an \\"indifference\\" to all forms of sociological theorizing.Garfinkel, H., and Harvey Sacks. \\"On Formal Structures of Practical Actions.\\" In Theoretical Sociology: Perspectives and Developments, edited by J.C. McKinney and E. Tiryakian, 337-66. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1970, 345. Instead of viewing social practice through a theoretical lens, Garfinkel sought to explore the social world directly and describe its autochthonous workings in elaborate detail. Durkheim famously stated, \\"[t]he objective reality of social facts is sociology's fundamental principle.\\"Durkheim, √âmile. \\"The Rules of Sociological Method.\\" In The Rules of Sociological Method, edited by Steven Lukes, 31-163. New York: Free Press, 1982. Garfinkel substituted 'phenomenon' for 'principle', signaling a different approach to sociological inquiry.Garfinkel, 1967, vii. The task of sociology, as he envisions it, is to conduct investigations into just how Durkheim's social facts are brought into being. The result is an \\"alternate, asymmetric and incommensurable\\" program of sociological inquiry.Garfinkel, 2002, 122. Alfred Sch√ºtz, a European scholar and acquaintance of Garfinkel introduced the young sociologist to newly emerging ideas in social theory, psychology and phenomenology.Psathas, G. (2004). Alfred Schutz's Influence on American Sociologists and Sociology. In Human Studies (Vol. 27, pp. 1-35). Netherlands: Kluwer Academic. Sch√ºtz, like Parsons, was concerned with establishing a sound foundation for research in the social sciences. He took issue, however, with the Parsonsian assumption that actors in society always behave rationally. Sch√ºtz made a distinction between reasoning in the 'natural attitude' and scientific reasoning.Sch√ºtz, Alfred. \\"The Problem of Rationality in the Social World.\\" Economica 10, no. 38 (1943): 130-149. The reasoning of scientists builds upon everyday commonsense, but, in addition, employs a \\"postulate of rationality.\\"Sch√ºtz, 1943, p. 147 Scientific reasoning imposes special requirements on their claims and conclusions (e.g., application of rules of formal logic, standards of conceptual clarity, compatibility with established scientific 'facts'). This has two important implications for research in the social sciences. First, it is inappropriate for sociologists to use scientific reasoning as a lens for viewing human action in daily life, as Parsons had proposed, since they are distinct kinds of rationality. On the other hand, the traditionally assumed discontinuity between the claims of science and commonsense understandings is dissolved since scientific observations employ both forms of rationality.Sharrock, Wes. \\"What Garfinkel Makes of Schutz: The Past, Present and Future of an Alternate, Asymmetric and Incommensurable Approach to Sociology.\\" Theory & Science 5, no. 1 (2004): 1-13. This raises a flag for researchers in the social sciences, since these disciplines are fundamentally engaged in the study of the shared understandings that underlie the day-to-day functioning of society. How can we make detached, objective claims about everyday reasoning, if our conceptual apparatus is hopelessly contaminated with commonsense categories and rationalities? The roots of ethnomethodology Garfinkel's concept of ethnomethodology started with his attempt at analyzing a jury discussion after a Chicago case in 1945. Garfinkel was attempting to understand the way jurors knew how to act as jurors.Mann, Douglass. 2008. \\"Society as Symbols or Constructs.\\" Pp. 210-212 in Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory. Ontario, Canada: Oxford University Press. After attempting to understand the jurors actions, Garfinkel created the term \\"ethnomethodology\\" as a way to describe how people use different methods in order to understand the society they live in. Garfinkel noticed through his study of ethnomethodology that the methods people use to understand the society they live in are very much fixed in people's natural attitudes. His main idea was that when thinking through a sociological lens, sociologists would be only thinking about outside sources (social facts) to explain a situation when trying to explain what is happening within it. Garfinkel uses this point to emphasize how different ethnomethodology is from sociology and Durkheim's thinking. In sociology, it is more common to use outside sources such as institutions to describe a situation, rather than the individual.Allan, K. (2006). Organizing Ordinary Life. In Contemporary social and sociological theory: Visualizing social worlds. Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Pine Forge Press. 49-71. Rationality Accepting Sch√ºtz's critique of the Parsonian program, Garfinkel sought to find another way of addressing the Problem of Social Order. Social order arises in the very ways that participants conduct themselves together. The sense of a situation arises from their interactions. Garfinkel writes, \\"any social setting [can] be viewed as self-organizing with respect to the intelligible character of its own appearances as either representations of or as evidences- of-a-social-order.\\"Garfinkel, 1967, p. 33 The orderliness of social life, therefore, is produced through the moment-to-moment work of society's members and ethnomethodology's task is to explicate just how this work is done. He wrote, \\"Members to an organized arrangement are continually engaged in having to decide, recognize, persuade, or make evident the rational, i.e., the coherent, or consistent, or chosen, or planful, or effective, or methodical, or knowledgeable character of [their activities]\\".Garfinkel, Harold. Studies in Ethnomethodology. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 32. On first inspection, this might not seem very different from Parsons' proposal; however their views on rationality are not compatible. For Garfinkel, society's character is not dictated by an imposed standard of rationality, either scientific or otherwise. To Garfinkel, rationality is itself produced as a local accomplishment in, and as, the very ways that society's members craft their moment-to-moment interaction. He writes: In his chapter, \\"The Rational Properties of Scientific and Common Sense Activities\\" in his book, Studies in Ethnomethodology, 1967, Garfinkel discusses how there are various meanings of the term \\"rationality\\" in relation to the way people behave. Garfinkel mentions Sch√ºtz's paper on the issues of rationality and his various meanings of the term rationality. Garfinkel discusses each of these \\"rationalities\\" and the \\"behaviors\\" that result, which are:Sica, Alan. 2005. \\"Harold Garfinkel: 1917.\\" Pp. 609-612 in Social Thought: From the Enlightenment to the Present. Boston, MA: Pearson Education. # Categorizing and Comparing: \\"Sometimes rationality refers to the fact that he searches the two situations with regard to their comparability, and sometimes to his concern for making matters comparable\\" # Tolerable error: \\"It is possible for a person to 'require' varying degrees of 'goodness of fit' between an observation and theory in terms of which he names, measures, describes, or otherwise intends the sense of his observation as a datum\\" # Search for \\"means\\": \\"Rationality is sometimes used to mean that a person reviews rules of procedure which in the past yielded the practical effects now desired\\" # Analysis of alternatives and consequences: \\"Frequently the term rationality is used to call attention to the fact that a person in assessing a situation anticipates the alterations which his actions will produce\\" # Strategy: \\"Prior to the actual occasion of choice a person may assign to a set of alternative courses of action the conditions under which any one of them is to be followed\\" # Concern for timing: \\"the concern for timing involves the extent to which he takes a position with regard to the possible ways in which events can temporally occur\\" # Predictability: \\"He may seek preliminary information about it in order to establish some empirical constants or he may attempt to make the situation predictable by examining the logical properties of the constructs he uses in 'defining' it ...\\" # Rules of procedure: \\"Sometimes rationality refers to rules of procedure and inference in terms of which a person decides the correctness of his judgments, inferences, perceptions, and characterizations\\" # Choice: \\"Sometimes the fact that a person is aware of the actual possibility of exercising a choice and sometimes the fact that he chooses are popular meanings of rationality\\" # Grounds of choice: \\"The grounds upon which a person exercises a choice among alternatives as well as the grounds he uses to legitimize a choice are frequently pointed out as rational features of an action\\" # Compatibility of ends-means relationships with principles of formal logic: \\"A person may treat a contemplated course of action as an arrangement of steps in the solution of a problem\\" # Semantic clarity and distinctness: \\"Reference is often made to a person's attempt to treat the semantic clarity of a construction as a variable with a maximum value which must be approximated as a required step in solving the problem of constructing a credible definition of a situation\\" # Clarity and distinctness \\"for its own sake.\\": \\"Sch√ºtz points out that a concern for clarity and distinctness may be a concern for distinctness that is adequate for the person's purposes.\\" # Compatibility of the definition of a situation with scientific knowledge: \\"A person can allow what he treats as 'matters of fact' to be criticized in terms of their compatibility with the body of scientific findings\\" Garfinkel notes that often, rationality refers to \\"the person's feelings that accompany his conduct, e.g. \\"affective neutrality,\\" \\"unemotional,\\" \\"detached,\\" \\"disinterested,\\" and \\"impersonal.\\" For the theoretical tasks of this paper, however, the fact that a person may attend his environment with such feelings is uninteresting. It is of interest, however, that a person uses his feelings about his environment to recommend the sensible character of the thing he is talking about or the warrant of a finding.\\" Reflexivity Reflexivity means that members shape action in relation to context while the context itself is constantly being redefined through action.Heritage, John. Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology. Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 1984, p. 242. Garfinkel regarded indexical expressions as key phenomena. Words like here, now, and me shift their meaning depending on when and where they are used. Philosophers and linguists refer to such terms as indexicals because they point into (index) the situational context in which they are produced. One of Garfinkel's contributions was to note that such expressions go beyond \\"here\\", \\"now,\\" etc. and encompass any and all utterances that members of society produce. As Garfinkel specified, \\"The demonstrably rational properties of indexical expressions and indexical actions [are] an ongoing achievement of the organized activities of everyday life\\".Garfinkel, 1967, p. 34 The pervasiveness of indexical expressions and their member- ordered properties means that all forms of action provide for their own understandability through the methods by which they are produced.Maynard, Douglas W., and Steven E. Clayman. \\"The Diversity of Ethnomethodology.\\" Annual Review of Sociology 17 (1991): 397-98. That is, action has the property of reflexivity whereby such action is made meaningful in the light of the very situation within which it is produced. The contextual setting, however, should not be seen as a passive backdrop for the action. The initial insight into the importance of reflexivity occurred during the study of juror's deliberations, wherein what jurors had decided was used by them to reflexively organize the plausibility of what they were deciding. Other investigations revealed that parties did not always know what they meant by their own formulations; rather, verbal formulations of the local order of an event were used to collect the very meanings that gave them their coherent sense. Garfinkel declared that the issue of how practical actions are tied to their context lies at the heart of ethnomethodological inquiry. Using professional coffee tasting as an illustration here, taste descriptors do not merely describe but also direct the tasting of a cup of coffee; hence, a descriptor is not merely the causal result of what is tasted, as in: Nor is it an imperialism of a methodology: Rather, the description and what it describes are mutually determinative: The descriptors operate reflexively by finding in the coffee what they mean, and each is used to make the other more explicit. Much the same may be said about rules-in-games or the use of accounts in ordinary action.Wieder, D. Lawrence. Language and Social Reality: The Case of Telling the Convict Code. The Hague: Mouton, 1974. This reflexivity of accounts is ubiquitous, and its sense has nearly nothing to do with how the term \\"reflexivity\\" is used in analytic philosophy, in \\"reflexive ethnographies\\" that endeavor to expose the influence of the researcher in organizing the ethnography, or the way many social scientists use \\"reflexivity\\" as a synonym for \\"self-reflection.\\" For ethnomethodology reflexivity is an actual, unavoidable feature of everyone's daily life. Service Lines Garfinkel has frequently illustrated ethnomethodological analysis by means of the illustration of service lines.Garfinkel 2002, 255-258. See also, Livingston, Eric. Making Sense of Ethnomethodology. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1987, 4-6, 13-15, 82. Everyone knows what it is like to stand in a line. Queues are a part of our everyday social life; they are something within which we all participate as we carry out our everyday affairs. We recognize when someone is waiting in a line and, when we are \\"doing\\" being a member of a line, we have ways of showing it. In other words, lines may seem impromptu and routine, but they exhibit an internal, member-produced embodied structure. A line is \\"witnessably a produced social object;\\"Livingston, op cit, 13. it is, in Durkheimian terms, a \\"social fact.\\" Participants' actions as \\"seeably\\" what they are (such as occupying a position in a queue) depend upon practices that the participant engages in relation to others' practices in the proximate vicinity. To recognize someone as in a line, or to be seen as \\"in line\\" ourselves requires attention to bodily movement and bodily placement in relation to others and to the physical environment that those movements also constitute. This is another sense that we consider the action to be indexical‚Äîit is made meaningful in the ways in which it is tied to the situation and the practices of members who produce it. The ethnomethodologist's task becomes one of analyzing how members' ongoing conduct is a constituent aspect of this or that course of action. Such analysis can be applied to any sort of social matter (e.g., being female, following instructions, performing a proof, participating in a conversation). These topics are representative of the kinds of inquiry that ethnomethodology was intended to undertake. In particular, Garfinkel conducted a famous case study on Agnes, a transgender woman in 1967. \\"Garfinkel view[ed] sexuality as a practical and ongoing accomplishment of members through their practical activities\\" and focused on how \\"Agnes 'passed' as a normal female despite the continuous risk that she would be revealed as a transsexual.\\"Kwang-ki, Kim. 2011. \\"Harold Garfinkel.\\" Pp. 118-119 in Order and agency in modernity:Talcott Parsons, Erving Goffman, and Harold Garfinkel. Palo Alto, CA. Breaching experiments According to George Ritzer, a sociologist, Breaching experiments are experiments where \\"social reality is violated in order to shed light on the methods by which people construct social reality.\\" In Garfinkel's work, Garfinkel encouraged his students to attempt breaching experiments in order to provide examples of basic ethnomethodology. According to Garfinkel, these experiments are important because they help us understand '\\"the socially standardized and standardizing, 'seen but unnoticed,' expected, background features of everyday scenes.'\\" He highlights many of these experiments in his books. The following is an example of one of Garfinkel's breaching experiments from his book, Studies in Ethnomethodology. Today, some textbooks in sociology often suggest that breaching experiments are the research method that ethnomethodologists use to explore the social organization of action. However, for Garfinkel breaching experiments mostly are a teaching tool that he Garfinkel, Harold. 2002. \\"Ethnomethodology's Program: Working out Durkheim's Aphorism. Rowman- Littlefield describes as \\"tutorial exercises in Ethnomethodology's Program.vom Lehn, Dirk 2014. Harold Garfinkel: The Creation and Development of Ethnomethodology. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press Influence on later research A substantial corpus of empirical work has developed exploring the issues raised by Garfinkel's writings. Directly inspired by Garfinkel, Harvey Sacks undertook to investigate the sequential organization of conversational interaction.Sacks, Harvey. Lectures on Conversation. Oxford, UK: Blackwell, 1992. This program, pioneered with colleagues Gail Jefferson and Emanuel Schegloff, has produced a large and flourishing research literature. A second, smaller literature has grown out of another of Sacks' interests having to do with social categorization practices.Sacks, Harvey. \\"An Initial Investigation of the Usability of Conversational Data for Doing Sociology.\\" In Studies in Social Interaction, edited by David Sudnow, 31-63. New York: Free Press, 1972. Sociologist Emanuel A. Schegloff used the concept of ethnomethodology to study telephone conversations and how these they influence social interaction. Gail Jefferson used ethnomethodology to study laughter and how people know when it is appropriate to laugh in conversation. John Heritage and David Greatbach studied rhetoric of political speeches and their relation to the amount of applause the speaker receives, whereas Steven Clayman studied how booing in an audience is generated. Philip Manning and George Ray studied shyness in an ethnomethodological way. Ethnomethodologists such as Graham Button, R. J Anderson, John Hughes, Wes Sharrock, Angela Garcia, Jack Whalen and D. H Zimmerman all study ethnomethodology within institutions. Early on, Garfinkel issued a call for ethnomethodologically informed investigations into the nature of work.Garfinkel, Harold. Ethnomethodological Studies of Work. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1986. This led to a wide variety of studies focusing on different occupations and professions including, laboratory science,Lynch, Michael. \\"Scientific Practice and Ordinary Action: Ethnomethodology and Social Studies of Science.\\" New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993. law,Atkinson, J.

Garfinkel's program strongly resonates in a wide range of disciplines, including sociology, linguistics, gender studies, organisation studies and management as well as in the technical sciences. In the technical sciences, ethnomethodology's influence can probably be ascribed to Lucy Suchman's analysis of learning to use a copy machine.Suchman, Lucy. Human-Machine Reconfigurations: Plans and Situated Actions. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007. It came to serve as an important critique of theories of planning in Artificial Intelligence. Selected publications The bulk of Garfinkel's original writings came in the form of scholarly articles and technical reports, most of which were subsequently republished as book chapters. To appreciate the sequential development of Garfinkel's thought, however, it is important to understand when these pieces were actually written. Although published in 2006, Seeing SociologicallyGarfinkel, Harold, Seeing Sociologically: The Routine Grounds of Social Action. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishers, 2006. was actually written as an annotated version of a draft dissertation proposal two years after arriving at Harvard. Toward a Sociological Theory of InformationGarfinkel, Harold, Toward a Sociological Theory of Information. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishers, 2008. was also written while Garfinkel was a student and was based on a 1952 report prepared in conjunction with the Organizational Behavior Project at Princeton. Some of Garfinkel's early papers on ethnomethodology were republished as Studies in Ethnomethodology.First published by Prentice-Hall in 1967 and later reissued in an expanded edition by Paradigm Publishers (Boulder, CO, forthcoming). This publication is well known by many sociologists. Garfinkel subsequently published an edited anthology showcasing selected examples of ethnomethodologically informed work.Garfinkel, 1986. Later still, a mix of previously published papers and some new writing was released as Ethnomethodology's Program: Working Out Durkheim's Aphorism.Garfinkel, 2002. This latter collection, in conjunction with the Studies, represent the definitive exposition of the ethnomethodological approach. Garfinkel had planned to publish a companion piece to Ethnomethodology's Program, which was tentatively entitled, \\"Workplace and Documentary Diversity of Ethnomethodological Studies of Work and Sciences by Ethnomethodology's Authors: What did we do? What did we learn?\\". This project was never completed, but some preliminary notes were published in Human Studies.Garfinkel, Harold.

He was the first hippie to be listed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.  Biography  Plamondon's father was half-Odawa and his mother was part-Ojibwe, which he was unaware of early in life. A Traverse City, Michigan couple adopted him and gave him his name, Lawrence Robert Plamondon. Plamondon had a troubled childhood and left home as a teenager. At the age of 21, Plamondon was in Detroit, Michigan in 1967, when the protests against the Vietnam War and riot occurred. Making sandals during the day and smoking marijuana in the evening, he was soon meeting with John Sinclair. In 1968, Plamondon and a few friends moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan where they established a commune at 1510 Hill Street. With John Sinclair, they founded the White Panther Party, which supported the goals of the Black Panther Party. He was indicted for bombing a CIA office in Ann Arbor on September 29, 1968. Changing his appearance, he went underground and fled to San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Germany, Italy, and finally to Algeria. In May 1970, he was listed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. After a few months he covertly returned to the United States. In July 1970, Plamondon was discovered and arrested after being stopped for littering. While waiting trial and after being convicted, he spent 32 months in federal prison. During the trial, the government admitted to wiretapping without a warrant. The case went to the United States Supreme Court and was decided in United States v. U.S. District Court, which held that even the invocation of \\"national security\\" by the president of the United States couldn't insulate illegal activity from Constitutional rights to privacy (). The charges were dismissed. Later, Plamondon found work driving equipment trucks for rock bands including Kiss and Foreigner. Plamondon lives in Barry County, Michigan with his wife Patricia Lynn. He is a self-employed carpenter. He tells American Indian stories to young children at schools, libraries, museums, and summer camps. His home is a gathering place for American Indian celebrations.

It is part of the hierarchy of standards that courts use to determine which is weightier: a constitutional right or principle, or the government's interest against observance of the principle. The lesser standards are rational basis review and exacting or intermediate scrutiny. These standards are used to test statutes and government action at all levels of government within the United States. The notion of \\"levels of judicial scrutiny\\", including strict scrutiny, was introduced in Footnote 4 of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938), one of a series of decisions testing the constitutionality of New Deal legislation. The first and most notable case in which the Supreme Court applied the strict scrutiny standard and found the government's actions constitutional was Korematsu v. United States (1944), in which the Court upheld the forced relocation of Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II.  Applicability  U.S. courts apply the strict scrutiny standard in two contexts: when a fundamental constitutional right is infringed,Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 155 (1973) (Blackmun, J.), accessed July 5, 2011 particularly those found in the Bill of Rights and those the court has deemed a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause or \\"liberty clause\\" of the 14th Amendment, or when a government action applies to a \\"suspect classification\\", such as race or national origin. To pass strict scrutiny, the law or policy must satisfy three tests: * It must be justified by a compelling governmental interest. While the Courts have never brightly defined how to determine if an interest is compelling, the concept generally refers to something necessary or crucial, as opposed to something merely preferred. Examples include national security, preserving the lives of a large number of individuals, and not violating explicit constitutional protections. * The law or policy must be narrowly tailored to achieve that goal or interest. If the government action encompasses too much (overbroad) or fails to address essential aspects of the compelling interest, then the rule is not considered narrowly tailored. * The law or policy must be the least restrictive means for achieving that interest: there must not be a less restrictive way to effectively achieve the compelling government interest. The test will be met even if there is another method that is equally the least restrictive. Some legal scholars consider this \\"least restrictive means\\" requirement part of being narrowly tailored, but the Court generally evaluates it separately. Legal scholars, including judges and professors, often say that strict scrutiny is \\"strict in theory, fatal in fact\\" since popular perception is that most laws subjected to the standard are struck down. However, an empirical study of strict scrutiny decisions in the federal courts found that laws survive strict scrutiny more than 30% of the time. In one area of law, religious liberty, laws that burden religious liberty survived strict scrutiny review in nearly 60% of cases. However, a discrepancy was found in the type of religious liberty claim, with most claims for exemption from law failing and no allegedly discriminatory laws surviving.Adam Winkler, \\"Fatal in Theory and Strict in Fact: An Empirical Analysis of Strict Scrutiny in the Federal Courts\\", Vanderbilt Law Review\\", Vol. 59, p. 793, 2006 See also the cases cited below, however; several appear to permit the exemption from laws based upon religious liberty. Harvard law professor Richard Fallon, Jr. has written that, rather than being neatly applied, strict scrutiny‚Äôs ‚Äúinterpretation is more varied than is often recognized‚Äù, a view that has been acknowledged by at least one U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Clarence Thomas (e.g. in his dissent (part III) in Hellerstedt). The compelling state interest test is distinguishable from the rational basis test, which involves claims that do not involve a suspect class and involve a liberty interest rather than a fundamental right. It is also important to note that, unlike the rational basis test, the burden of proof falls on the state in cases that require strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny. Suspect classification The Supreme Court has established standards for determining whether a statute or policy's classification requires the use of strict scrutiny. The class must have experienced a history of discrimination, must be definable as a group based on \\"obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics,\\" be a minority or \\"politically powerless,\\" and its characteristics must have little relationship to the government's policy aims or the ability of the group's members to contribute to society. The Court has consistently found that classifications based on race, national origin, and alienage require strict scrutiny review. The Supreme Court held that all race-based classifications must be subjected to strict scrutiny in Adarand Constructors v. Pe√±a, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), overruling Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC (89-453), 497 U.S. 547 (1990), which had briefly allowed the use of intermediate scrutiny to analyze the Equal Protection implications of race-based classifications in the narrow category of affirmative-action programs established by the federal government in the broadcasting field. De jure versus de facto discrimination As applied in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld the race-based exclusion order and internment during World War II of Japanese Americans who had resided on the West Coast of the United States, strict scrutiny was limited to instances of de jure discrimination, where a racial classification is written into the language of a statute. The Supreme Court's decision in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. provided further definition to the concept of intent and clarified three particular areas in which intent of a particular administrative or legislative decision becomes apparent, the presence of any of which demands the harsher equal protection test. The Court must use strict scrutiny if one of these tests, among others, is met: # the impact is so \\"stark and dramatic\\" as to be unexplainable on non- racial grounds, as in Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886) # the historical background of the decision suggests intent # the legislative and administrative records leading up to the decision show intent  Notable cases  *Skinner v.

Tiberius\\" Gibson (born 26 March 1955) is an American software engineer, security researcher, and IT security proponent. In the early 1980s, Gibson worked on light pen technology for use with Apple and Atari systems. In 1985, he founded Gibson Research Corporation, best known for its SpinRite software. Personal Gibson started working on computers as a teenager, and got his first computing job with Stanford University's artificial intelligence lab when he was 15 years old. He studied electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. Career Gibson was hired as a programmer for California Pacific Computer Company in 1980, where he worked on copy protection for the company's products. Gibson founded Gibson Laboratories in Laguna Hills, California in 1981; Gibson Labs developed a light pen for the Apple II, Atari, and other platforms and went out of business in 1983. In 1985 Gibson founded Gibson Research Corporation (GRC) - a computer software development firm. From 1986 to 1993 Gibson wrote the \\"Tech Talk\\" column for InfoWorld magazine. In 1999, Gibson created one of the first adware removal programs, which he called OptOut. In 2001, Gibson predicted that Microsoft's implementation of the SOCK_RAW protocol in the initial release of Windows XP would lead to widespread chaos by making it easier for Windows XP users to create denial of service (DoS) attacks. In that year, his company's website was brought down by a DoS attack; the attacks continued for two weeks. Gibson blogged about the attacks and his (ultimately successful) efforts to track down the hacker. Three years after the Windows XP release, Microsoft limited raw socket support in Service Pack 2. In 2005 Gibson launched a weekly podcast called \\"Security Now\\" with Leo Laporte on TWiT.tv, with its archives hosted on GRC's website. In 2006 Gibson raised the possibility that the Windows Metafile vulnerability bug was actually a backdoor intentionally engineered into the system. A response by Microsoft and by Mark Russinovich on Microsoft's Technet stated that the bug appeared to be coding error and that Gibson's reasoning was based upon Microsoft's abort procedure documentation being misleading. Furthermore, Peter Ferrie of Symantec Security Response, USA noted that: In 2013 Gibson proposed SQRL as a way to simplify the process of authentication without the risk of revelation of information about the transaction to a third party. GRC products GRC has created a number of utilities, most of which are freeware. * DNS Benchmark, freeware that lets users test the performance of the domain name servers used by their internet service providers. * Securable, freeware to test whether a pre-Windows 7 computer is 64-bit compatible. It also tells the user if Data Execution Prevention is enabled. *Shields Up, a free browser- based firewall testing service; one of the oldest available * SpinRite, a hard disk scanning and data recovery utility first released in 1988. As of January 2019 the current version was 6.0, which was first released in 2004. SpinRite is a commercial product, costing $89 as of January 2019. Gibson's work on SpinRite has led to him being considered an expert on hard drive failure. * Spoofarino, freeware released in 2006 and promised since the controversy over the launch of Windows XP in 2001, it enables users to test whether their internet service providers allow them to send forged or \\"spoofed\\" packets of data to Gibson's Web site. *Never10, standalone freeware program that toggles registry values in Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, which either disables or enables Microsoft's Get Windows 10 app and automatic OS upgrade. As of version 1.3 also triggers the removal of any previously downloaded Windows 10 upgrade files as part of the disable function. *InSpectre, a utility that examines a computer's vulnerability to the Meltdown and Spectre attacks.

It is the headquarters of the Kharagpur subdivision. It is the most populated, multicultural and cosmopolitan city of the district. The first Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), one of the Institutes of National Importance, was founded in Kharagpur in May 1950. It has one of the largest railway workshops in India, and the third longest railway platform in the world (1072.5 m).  History  Kharagpur received its name from the twelfth king of the Mallabhum dynasty, Kharga Malla, when he conquered it. Kharagpur was a part of the Hijli Kingdom and ruled by Hindu Oriya rulers as a feudatory under Gajapati Kings of Odisha. Historians claim that in the 16th century, Kharagpur was still a small village surrounded by dense forests. The village was on high rocky barren land. The only inhabited settlement near Kharagpur was Hijli. Hijli was a small island village on the banks of the Rasulpur River, in the delta of Bay of Bengal. It developed into a port town in 1687. Hijli was also a province and it existed until 1886. It covered parts of Bengal and Orissa. It had important towns like Tamluk, Panskura, and Debra, along with the Kelghai and Haldi rivers on the north, south, and east sides bounded by Bay of Bengal and Kharagpur, Keshiary, Dantan, and Jaleswar on the west. Hijli was ruled by Taj Khan who was the disciple of Guru Peer Mackdram Sha Chisti. It was also ruled by the Kushan, Gupta, and Pal dynasties, and by the Mughals. It is said that Hijli had excellent business and trade centers with judiciary, prison, and administrative offices during the reign of Hindu Kings and during the Mughal Raj. The capital of Hijli was in Bahiri up to 1628 and was shifted to Hijli afterwards. Hijli Province was at its peak in 1754 and was highly prosperous during this period. Captain Nicolson was the first English colonialist to invade Hijli and captured the port. In 1687 Job Charnock with soldiers and warships captured Hijli, defeating Hindu and Mughal defenders. After the war with the Mughals, a treaty was signed between Job Charnock and the Mughal Emperor. The loss suffered by Job Charnock forced him to leave Hijli and to proceed towards Uluberia, while the Mughal Emperor continued to rule the province. From there, they finally settled at Sutanuti in Kolkata to establish their business in Eastern India. This was the start of the East India Company in India. Hijli as we know it today is only a small part of the Hijli Province, and was created for establishing administrative offices by the British in the 19th century. It is curious that almost the entire Kharagpur division of today has boundaries identical to Hijli Province. In the 18th century Khejuri, another port town was set up on the banks of the Koukhali River in the delta region. It was established by the British primarily for carrying out trade with European countries. Khejuri was also an island. In the devastating cyclone of 1864, both ports were destroyed. The islands have since merged with the mainland.  Railways in Kharagpur  The first railway establishment at Kharagpur started with the commissioning of the rail link between Cuttack ‚Äì Balasore ‚Äì Kharagpur and from Sini to Kolaghat via Kharagpur. Kharagpur as a junction station was established in Railway map in December 1898. The public mood and the reaction of society on introduction of rail transport in this region has been nicely depicted by the famous Bengali Novelist Dr Ramapada Chowdhury (who was born and raised in Kharagpur) in his novel Prothom Prohor. (1954) It is said that the people were initially afraid to travel by train for fear of the bridge collapsing, and for fear of getting outcaste or Dalit status, since there were no separate seating arrangement for different castes and religions. However, things changed due to famines in the early 20th century. The railway company came forward and offered jobs to the local unemployed men, gave them free rides on trains, and even offered blankets to those travelling by train. This promotional scheme broke the taboos and made rail transport acceptable to this society. Midnapur's District Headquarters was connected to the bank of the Kosai River in February 1900. Construction of the bridge over Kosai completed in June 1901. The rail line from Howrah to Kolaghat up to the Eastern bank and from Kharagpur up to Western bank of Rupnarayan River was completed in 1899. However, trains between Howrah and Kharagpur were possible only in April 1900 after the bridge over Rupnarayan River was completed. Howrah ‚Äì Amta light Railway (2 ft gauge - 610 mm) line was completed in 1898 and was operated by M/s Martin & Co. of Calcutta. This link remained operative till 1971. After closure of the light railways, the demand for a broad gauge line between Howrah and Amta gained momentum. The project was completed in four phases. In the first phase, the line between Santragachi and Domjur was completed in 1984. In the second phase it got extended up to Bargachia in 1985, and later up to Munsirhat. Mahendralal Nagar station was completed in 2000, and the final leg to Amta was completed in December 2004. Former captain of Indian Cricket team Mahendra Singh Dhoni also worked as a ticket collector at the Kharagpur Railway station from 2000-2003 before commencing his cricket career playing for India. The need for a rail link between Panskura and Tamluk was conceived at the beginning of the 20th century, almost at the same time the rail link between Howrah and Kharagpur was opened. The railway company received offers for construction from two Agencies, M/s Martin & Company and M/s Babu Nibaran Chandra Dutta, the former against a guaranteed return of 3.5% while the latter with none. Although the offer of the latter was lucrative, the dilemma of whether to offer the work of construction to a native or not forced the project to be abandoned. After Independence, the requirement of rail link connecting Panskura and Durgachak came up primarily for the purpose of constructing the Haldia Port. The rail link between Panskura ‚Äì Durgachak via Tamluk completed in 1968, which was later extended to Haldia in 1975. Extension of the rail link to Digha from Tamluk was sanctioned in 1984; it took 20 years to complete, set in two phases. The first phase linked Tamluk and Contai in November 2003, and the tourist destination Digha was connected to Howrah in December 2004. Geographical location of Kharagpur and its rail links with the rest of the country favored the construction of a centralized workshop with facilities to carry out major repairs of all broad gauge stock. The work was sanctioned in 1900; construction of the workshop was completed in 1904. Kharagpur has Asia's largest railway Solid State Interlocking (SSI) system. The Railways also plan to have an East Coast Dedicated Freight Corridor stretching from Kharagpur in West Bengal to Vijayawada of Andhra Pradesh.  Geography  Location Kharagpur is located at . Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the city. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. Urban structure Kharagpur is the fourth largest city of West Bengal in area after Kolkata, Durgapur and Asansol. It is also the fifth most populated city of West Bengal after Kolkata, Asansol, Siliguri, Durgapur - located at , covering an area of about 127 km2 in southern part of West Midnapore. It has an average elevation of 29 metres (95 ft). This sub-division town is formed with Dalma Pahar and alluvial tract of Midnapore. It is intersected by numerous waterways, the important rivers being Subarnarekha, Keleghai and Kangsabati. Nimpura contains colonies housing thousands of railway employees. There is a long winding road from Nimpura to Hijli which goes through Tangrahut (Arambati), Talbagicha and another from Kalaikunda to Gopali through Hiradihi, Talbagicha and Hijli cooperative society also planned residential area of Kharagpur city. The south of Kharagpur is a planned area belonging to the Indian Railways and which was established by the Britishers as a residential area. Nearby is the Kharagpur Municipality and the fire station. Kharagpur Railway Colony is the biggest railway settlement in India having about 13,000 quarters. There are several railway residential areas namely Chhota Ayma, Bara Ayma, Old Settlement, New Settlement, Mathurakati, Nimpura, South Side, Traffic and several more. The BNR (Bengal Nagpur Railway) ground, owned by the railway, is a very large undeveloped playground which holds great potential to be developed and properly maintained. Outside the railway settlement popular areas are Bhawanipur, Subhaspally, Kharida, Malancha, Inda, Jhapatapur, Talbagicha, Prem Bazaar, amongst others. An important market place has developed in and around Gole Bazaar, a reliable but highly congested shopping destination for locals. Other marketplaces like Talbagicha Bazar, Gate Bazar, Inda Bazar, Puratan Bazar, the Janata Market, the DVC market and the Technology market are also renowned in Kharagpur. Growth is witnessed around Chowringhee and Inda areas where new constructions and projects are taking shape. Big Bazaar, operated by Future Group, was the first mall to open in Kharagpur.

Kharagpur (Town) police station has jurisdiction over Kharagpur municipality. Kharagpur (Local) police station has jurisdiction over Kharagpur I and Kharagpur II CD Blocks. The state government is also working on setting up a separate police commissionerate at Kharagpur to enhance the security of this growing region.  Civic administration and utility services  Kharagpur Municipality looks after civic affairs in the town. There is a proposal to upgrade it to a Municipal Corporation after including the railway area under its jurisdiction. As of now responsibility of civic amenities in railway area lies with the Divisional Railway Manager, Kharagpur Division who is also the head of railway establishment in Kharagpur. State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, or BSNL, as well as private enterprises, among them Vodafone, Bharti Airtel, Jio, Reliance and Idea Cellular are the leading telephone, cell phone and internet service providers in the city. Healthcare European Block of Railway Hospital Kharagpur Dr B C Roy Institute of Medical Science & Research The need for a centralized Hospital at Khargpur was also felt in the late 19th century. Subsequently, a Hospital with complete medical facilities was established in 1897. Dr Arthur Martin-Leake, Victorian Cross winner was appointed as Chief Medical Officer of Kharagpur Hospital in 1904. However the town still needs good private hospitals and advanced medication and healthcare facilities as in current situation its citizens have to depend on Kolkata for treatment, which is at a distance of 132 km. Today, the Railway Main Hospital and Kharagpur Sub-divisional Hospital (Chandmari Hospital) are main public sector hospitals in Kharagpur. Recently, since the city lies at an important junction of state and national highways, a Trauma Care Centre of level - 3 category is being set up in Kharagpur Sub-divisional Hospital. A number of private clinics and nursing homes also operate here. Dr. B. C. Roy Institute of Medical Science & Research is an upcoming medical college and hospital near IIT Kharagpur. Culture Apart from Bengali, which is predominantly spoken in the region, Hindi, Telugu, Odia and Punjabi are also widely spoken languages. Places of worship include a Durga Mandir at Gole Bazar, Sitala Mandir at Puratan Bazar, Jama Masjid at Gole Bazar, Kanaka Durga Temple near Nimpura, Jagannath Mandir near Gate Bazar, a Gurudwara at Subhaspally and at Nimpura, Jalaram Temple at Jhapatapur and several religious structures. The most famous festivals here are Durga Puja, Eid-ul-Fitr, Ganesh Puja, Eid-ul- Azha, Saraswati Puja, Shab-e-Barat, Kali Puja, Muharram, Ammavaari Puja, Navratri, Barah wafat and others.

There are several origin theories:The Paddick One-Name Study all may be true as there are distinct groupings of Paddicks across England. The first group, from the Somerset, Dorset and Bristol area, is thought to derive from the Old English paddock meaning toad. In medieval England, paddock was a nickname applied to anyone who was considered mean or spiteful,Oxford English Dictionary and the progenitor of this group is thought to have been a French merchant called Jean le Pedoc who lived in Bristol in the early 14th century. The second group comes from the English Midlands, particularly Shropshire and Staffordshire, though also through time from Birmingham and Lancashire. This name, although most commonly written as Paddock rather than Paddick, was originally written as Parrock and derives from the same etymology as the word \\"park\\". The vast majority of people with the last name Paddick or Paddock in England are descended from this group. The third group is concentrated around the South East England coast, particularly in the counties of Hampshire and Sussex, and this group is a variant of the surname Padwick.

A tank gun is the main armament of a tank. Modern tank guns are large-caliber high-velocity guns, capable of firing kinetic energy penetrators, high explosive anti-tank rounds, and in some cases guided missiles. Anti-aircraft guns can also be mounted to tanks. As the tank's primary armament, they are almost always employed in a direct fire mode to defeat a variety of ground targets at all ranges, including dug-in infantry, lightly armored vehicles, and especially other heavily armored tanks. They must provide accuracy, range, penetration, and rapid fire in a package that is as compact and lightweight as possible, to allow mounting in the cramped confines of an armored gun turret. Tank guns generally use self-contained ammunition, allowing rapid loading (or use of an autoloader). They often display a bulge in the barrel, which is a bore evacuator, or a device on the muzzle, which is a muzzle brake. History World War I Saint-Chamond tank of 1917, with 75 mm gun in nose Replica of German A7V \\"Wotan\\" showing 57 mm Maxim-Nordenfelt gun in front Mk II tank captured by German troops in April 1917, showing long 57 mm naval gun in side sponson The first tanks were used to break through trench defences in support of infantry actions particularly machine gun positions during the First World War and they were fitted with machine guns or high explosive firing guns of modest calibre. These were naval or field artillery pieces stripped from their carriages and mounted in sponsons or casemates on armored vehicles. The early British Mark I tanks of 1916 used naval 57 mm QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss mounted at the sides in sponsons. These guns proved too long for use in the British tank designs as they would come into contact with obstacles and the ground on uneven terrain, and the succeeding Mark IV tank of 1917 was equipped with the shortened 6 pounder 6 cwt version which can be considered the first specialised tank gun. The first German tank, the A7V, utilized 57 mm Maxim-Nordenfelt fortification guns captured from Belgium and Russia, but mounted at the front. The early French Schneider CA1 mounted a short 75 mm mortar on one side, while the Saint-Chamond mounted a standard 75 mm field gun in the nose. The thin armour of the tanks meant that such weapons were effective against other vehicles, though the Germans fielded few tanks anyway and the Allied tanks concentrated on anti-infantry and infantry support activities. World War II This 2-pounder (40 mm) gun, typical of early WWII designs, was adequate for destroying lightly armored early war tanks. The long-barrelled 75 mm gun of this Panzer IV is typical of larger late WWII designs built to destroy heavily armored tanks. This thinking remained pervasive into the dawn of World War II, when most tank guns were still modifications of existing artillery pieces, and were expected to primarily be used against unarmored targets. The larger caliber, shorter range artillery mounting did not go away however. Tanks intended specifically for infantry support (the infantry tanks), expected to take out emplacements and infantry concentrations, carried large calibre weapons to fire large high-explosive shells‚Äîthough these could be quite effective against other vehicles at close ranges. In some designs - for example, M3 Lee, Churchill, Char B1 - the larger bore weapons were mounted within the tank hull while a second gun for use against tanks was fitted in a turret. However, other strategists saw new roles for tanks in war, and wanted more specifically developed guns tailored to these missions. The ability to destroy enemy tanks was foremost on their minds. To this end, the emerging anti-tank gun designs were modified to fit tanks. These weapons fired smaller shells, but at higher velocities with higher accuracy, improving their performance against armor. Such light guns as the QF 2-pounder (40 mm) and 37 mm equipped British cruiser tanks and infantry tanks in the late 1930s. These weapons lacked a good high-explosive shell for attacking infantry and fortifications, but were effective against the light armor of the time. World War II saw a leapfrog growth in all areas of military technology. Battlefield experience led to increasingly powerful weapons being adopted. Guns with calibres from 20 mm to 40 mm soon gave way to 50 mm, 75 mm, 85 mm, 88 mm, 90 mm and 122 mm calibre. In 1939, the standard German panzer had either a 20 mm or 37 mm medium-velocity weapon, but by 1945 long-barrelled 75 mm and 88 mm high-velocity guns were common. The Soviets introduced their 122 mm in a turreted heavy tank series, the Iosef Stalin tanks. Shells were improved to provide better penetration with harder materials and scientific shaping. All of these meant improvements in accuracy and range, although the average tank had to grow as well to carry the ammunition, mounting, and protection for these powerful guns. While high velocity tank guns were effective against other tanks, for the most part British tanks moved to a dual purpose 75 mm gun capable of firing a useful HE shell; later in the war adding 76mm 17pdr gun armed tanks for better antitank capability. Many nations devised \\"tank destroyers\\" during the war - a vehicle specifically designed for anti-tank work, and armed more heavily than a tank on the same chassis could be. They generally fell into three overlapping categories: improvised modifications of old or captured tanks to render them viable again (such as converting the machine-gun-only Panzer I into the Panzerj√§ger I), often with haphazard, poorly protected, limited-traverse weapon mounts; the American offensive and mobile reserve model, which favoured lightly-armed open-top vehicles with a rotating turret and a powerful anti-tank-capable gun while relegating true tanks to infantry support role (exemplified by the M10 tank destroyer); and the casemate gun mount model, which often allowed the resultant vehicle to be hard to hit and have a well-sloped and heavily armoured glacis plate (for instance, the SU-100). The relative superiority in armament of tank destroyers was only relative, however: for instance, the SU-85 was a casemate-type TD on the T-34 chassis that was rendered obsolete once the basic T-34 switched from the 76 mm gun to the same 85 mm cannon, producing the T-34-85. An M1 Abrams firing. Challenger 2 after firing a high explosive shell during a firepower demonstration held on ranges at Warminster, Wiltshire. The power of tank guns can cause the ground to shake and dust to rise.  After World War II  Denel GT-2, a South African copy of the 90mm French DEFA D921 low-pressure rifled tank gun. This was the product of recoil control experiments aimed at allowing light tanks to carry larger cannon. By the end of the war the variety in tank designs was narrowed and the concept of the main battle tank emerged. After World War II, the race to increase caliber slowed. Slight increases were made between tank generations. In the West, guns of around 90 mm gave way to the ubiquitous 105 mm L7. This lasted a long while with a shift to 120 mm in the late 1970s and early 80s (the UK changed in the late 60s with their Chieftain tank). In the East, the 85 mm quickly yielded to the 100 mm and 115 mm U-5TS gun, with the 125 mm caliber now standard. Most of the improvements were instead made in ammunition and fire control systems. With kinetic energy penetrator rounds, solid shot and armour-piercing shell gave way to armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) (a product of 1944), and fin-stabilized (APFSDS) rounds with tungsten or depleted uranium penetrators. Parallel developments brought rounds based on chemical energy; High explosive squash head (HESH), and shaped-charge High explosive anti-tank (HEAT), with penetrating power independent of muzzle velocity or range. Stadiametric range- finders were successively replaced by coincidence and laser rangefinders. Accuracy of modern tank guns is improved over earlier weapons by computerized fire control systems, wind sensors, and muzzle referencing systems which compensate for barrel warping, wear and temperature. Fighting capability at night, in poor weather, and smoke was improved by infrared, light- intensification, and thermal imaging equipment. Technology of the guns themselves has had only a few innovations. Throughout the history of tank guns, they have almost exclusively been rifled weapons, however most modern tanks now use smoothbore guns. Rifling of the barrel imparts spin on the projectile, improving ballistic accuracy. The best traditional antitank weapons have been kinetic energy rounds, whose penetrating power and accuracy decrease with range. For longer ranges high explosive anti-tank rounds are more effective, but accuracy is limited; for extremely long ranges cannon- launched guided projectiles (CLGPs) are considered more accurate. The use of the autoloader has been a development favoured by some nations and not others. Some countries adopted it as a means to keep the overall size of the tank down. Interest has also been shown as a means to protect the crew by separating them further from the gun and ammunition. For example, an autoloader allows the use of an unmanned turret in the T-14 Armata. Smoothbore Rheinmetall 120 mm smoothbore tank gun (seen from the muzzle) of a Leopard 2A4. In the 1960s smoothbore tank guns were developed by the Soviet Union and later by the experimental US-FRG MBT-70 project. Based on their experience with the gun/missile system of the BMP-1, the Soviets produced the T-64B main battle tank, with an auto-loaded 2A46 125 mm smoothbore high-velocity tank gun, capable of firing APFSDS ammunition as well as ATGMs. Similar guns continue to be used in the latest Russian T-90, Ukrainian T-84, and Serbian M-84AS MBTs. The German company Rheinmetall developed a more conventional 120 mm smoothbore tank gun which can fire LAHAT missiles, adopted for the Leopard 2, and later the U.S. M1 Abrams. The chief advantages of smoothbore designs are their greater suitability for fin stabilised ammunition and their greatly reduced barrel wear compared with rifled designs. Much of the difference in operation between smoothbore and rifled guns shows in the type of secondary ammunition that they fire, with a smoothbore gun being ideal for firing HEAT rounds (although specially designed HEAT rounds can be fired from rifled guns) and rifling being necessary to fire HESH rounds. Most modern main battle tanks now mount a smoothbore gun. A notable exception are the tanks of the British Army which used the 120mm Royal Ordnance L11A5 rifled gun until the 1990s; it was then replaced it with the 120mm L30 rifled gun which remains in service. The Indian Arjun tank uses an Indian-developed 120mm rifled gun.

Events during the rule of Husayn *In 774 Husayn conspired with the Qahtanite aristocracy against the emir, proclaiming the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate in Hispania. In response, the emir sent general Abd al-Melek bin Umar, who obtained the allegiance of Abu Taur of Huesca and the Wali of Tudela, but who was rejected in Zaragoza. *In 777, the Wali of Barcelona, Sulayman al-Arabi (Sulayman ibn Yaqdhan al-Kalbi in the Arabic sources) offered Charlemagne his own allegiance and the allegiance of Husayn in Paderborn. But when in 778 Charlemagne arrived in Zaragoza, Husayn denied any promise. As Charlemagne could not take the city, he withdrew after a month, which then led to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass.

Relation to Pharmacokinetics It is an application of pharmacokinetics to determine the relationship between the systemic exposure of a compound and its toxicity. It is used primarily for establishing relationships between exposures in toxicology experiments in animals and the corresponding exposures in humans. However, it can also be used in environmental risk assessments in order to determine the potential effects of releasing chemicals into the environment. In order to quantify toxic effects toxicokinetics can be combined with toxicodynamics. Such toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models are used in ecotoxicology (see ecotoxmodels a website on mathematical models in ecotoxicology). Similarly, physiological toxicokinetic models are physiological pharmacokinetic models developed to describe and predict the behavior of a toxicant in an animal body; for example, what parts (compartments) of the body a chemical may tend to enter (e.g. fat, liver, spleen, etc.), and whether or not the chemical is expected to be metabolized or excreted and at what rate. Processes Four potential processes exist for a chemical interacting with an animal: absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). Absorption describes the entrance of the chemical into the body, and can occur through the air, water, food, or soil. Once a chemical is inside a body, it can be distributed to other areas of the body through diffusion or other biological processes. At this point, the chemical may undergo metabolism and be biotransformed into other chemicals (metabolites). These metabolites can be less or more toxic than the parent compound. After this potential biotransformation occurs, the metabolites may leave the body, be transformed into other compounds, or continue to be stored in the body compartments. A well designed toxicokinetic study may involve several different strategies and depends on the scientific question to be answered. Controlled acute and repeated toxicokinetic animal studies are useful to identify a chemical's biological persistence, tissue and whole body half-life, and its potential to bioaccumulate. Toxicokinetic profiles can change with increasing exposure duration or dose. Real world environmental exposures generally occur as low level mixtures, such as from air, water, food, or tobacco products. Mixture effects may differ from individual chemical toxicokinetic profiles because of chemical interactions, synergistic, or competitive processes. For other reasons, it is equally important to characterize the toxicokinetics of individual chemicals constituents found in mixtures as information on behavior or fate of the individual chemical can help explain environmental, human, and wildlife biomonitoring studies.

It is treated differently in Shia and Sunni Islam. This tax is paid to the imam, caliph or sultan, representing the state of Islam,Abdulaziz Sachedina (1980), Al-Khums: The Fifth in the ImƒÅmƒ´ Shƒ´ øƒ´ Legal System, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 39, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 276-277, 275-289, note 10 for distribution between the orphans, the needy, and the [stranded] traveler. In Sunni Islam tradition, the scope of khums tax has been ghanim, which is defined as the spoils of war. In Shia Islam tradition, states Abdulaziz Sachedina, the scope of khums tax has included, (1) booty (al-ghanima), (2) objects obtained from the sea (al- ghaws), (3) treasure (al-kanz), (4) mineral resources (al-ma'adin), (5) gainful earnings (arbaah al-makaasib, business profits), (6) the lawful (al- halaal) which has become mixed up with the unlawful (al-haraam), and (7) land which is transferred from a Muslim to a dhimmi (a free non-Muslim who is protected by a treaty of surrender) by the latter's purchase of it. The recipients of the collected khums have been the descendants of Muhammad and the Islamic clergy. Khums is a 20% tax that must be paid on all items regarded as ghanima (, booty seized with war). There are differing legal traditions within Islam about what constitutes ghanima, and thus how far-reaching khums should be. In some jurisdictions, khums included a 20% tax paid on business profit and on minerals extracted in regions under the control of the state. Khums is different and separate from other Islamic taxes such as zakat and jizya.Seri-Hersch (2010), \\"Transborder\\" Exchanges of People, Things, and Representations: Revisiting the Conflict Between Mahdist Sudan and Christian Ethiopia, 1885‚Äì1889, The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 1-26 Etymology The Arabic term khums literally means one-fifth. It is referred to as \\"Earnings,Profits,property holdings,savings \\" based on the Quran and various Hadiths. In other words, Khums and ghanima are revealed in the Quran. Concept Khums means \\"one-fifth or 20%\\".Abdulaziz Sachedina (1980), Al-Khums: The Fifth in the ImƒÅmƒ´ Shƒ´ øƒ´ Legal System, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 39, No. 4, 275-289 In Islamic legal terminology, it means one-fifth of certain items that a person acquires as wealth must be paid to the state of Islam. This is oneOther religiously required taxes in Islam include zakat, jizya, kharaj, ushur, etc. of many forms of tax in Islamic jurisprudence that applies on ghanima and fai (or fay). In the early and middle history of Islam, ghanima was property and wealth that was looted by the Muslim army after attacking the unbelievers. Fai was that property and wealth that was gained from confiscation without strife, that is if the unbelievers refused to fight or violently opposed the raid.Vik√∏r, K. S. (2000), JihƒÅd,'ilm and ta·π£awwuf: Two Justifications of Action from the Idrƒ´sƒ´ Tradition, Studia Islamica, No. 90 (2000), 153-176 Over time, the concept and scope of ghanima was expanded by Islamic scholars, and variations emerged between Sunni and Shia scholars over interpreting the definition of ghanima. Similarly, the percentage of fai was expanded to 100% using verse 59.7 of the Quran, thus placing it beyond khums. The 80% amount left after paying the 20% khums, was distributed among the army commander and soldiers who attacked the unbelievers.R Swarup (2002), Understanding the Hadith: The Sacred Traditions of Islam, , pp. 109-112MA Shomali, Message of Thaqalayn, Imamah and Wilayah VI, Spring 2013, Vol. 15, No. 1, pp 129 There are differences of opinion about the scope of khums in Sunni and Shia sects of Islam, as well as who owns it and how the collected khums should be spent.ALAMI ARDABILI ALI and SAJJADI ZADEH SAYYID ALI, A SURVEY OF KHUMS HADITHS IN SAHIH BUKHARI, ULUM-I-HADITH, WINTER 2011, Volume 15, Number 4 (58); pp. 140-162 Islamic scriptures This teaching is repeated in Sahih Hadith.One-fifth of Booty to the Cause of Allah (Khumus) University of Southern California According to Sahih al- Bukhari, when the delegates of the tribe of 'Abdul-Qais met the prophet and asked him some advice, he told them to pay \\"Khums (i.e. one-fifth) of the war booty to Allah\\". As mentioned in Sahih Muslim, since the prophet appointed someone as a leader, he recommended some principals such as \\"Fight in the name of Allah and in the way of Allah. Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war, do not embezzle the spoils [of war, booty]\\". Through a lengthy Hadith recorded in Kitab al-Kafi (a Shia reference), the Prophet Muhammad has mentioned that those entitled to receive Al-Khums are the relatives of the Holy Prophet whom Allah has mentioned in his words, \\"Warn your close relatives. They are the children of Abdul-Muttalib, men and women. None of the families of Quraysh or the Arabs or their slaves are lawful to receive al-Khums. The charities of the masses of people are lawful for their slaves to consume. One whose mother is from the family of Banu Hashim and his father from the masses of people, the charities are lawful for such person to consume. Such a person is not entitled to receive from al-Khums because Allah, the Most High has said, 'Call them sons of their own fathers'.\\" Shia jurisprudence (Ja'fari) Khums, in the Ja'fari Shia tradition, is applied to the business profit, or surplus, of a business income. It is payable at the beginning of the financial year, though this is regarded as being the time at which the amount becomes clear. Ghanima and one-fifth tax of khums applies wherever gain or profit is involved. \\"Ghanima\\" has two meanings as mentioned above; the second meaning is illustrated by the common use of the Islamic banking term \\"al-ghunm bil-ghurm\\" meaning \\"gains accompany liability for loss or risk\\"Glossary of Islamic Banking Terms In 13th century Shia religion, the khums was divided into two portions. One portion went to the descendants of Muhammad, the other portion was divided equally with one part given to Imam and clergy, while the other part went to the orphaned and poor Muslims.John L. Esposito (2004), The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, Oxford University Press, , p. 174 The famous view of contemporary Faqihs is that the Imam's portion (during the Occultation (Islam)) is used in the fields that the Marja' Taqlid has outlined. The Imam would use it in those ways, such as reinforcing Islam and Seminary, promotion of Islam, building mosques in necessary situations, libraries and schools' affairs, assisting old people, and actually all blessing affairs in the order of their priority and their religious significance.Borujerdi, Al-Mustanad Fi Sharh Orwatol-Wuthqa, P. 330 Khums became a major source of income and financial independence for the clergy in Shia regions. This practice has continued among Shia Muslims. It is narrated in Kitab al-Kafi that Imam Musa al-Kadhim would accept one dirham from the people, although he was one of the wealthiest in the city of Medina, to purify them. He compares this to Allah asking His creatures to lend to Him from their property, not because He is need, but rather it is His right as appointed guardian over His creatures. Sunni jurisprudence Scholars of the four Sunni Schools of fiqh‚ÄîHanafi, Maliki, Shafi‚Äòi and Hanbali‚Äîhave historically considered khums' 20% tax to be applicable on ghanayam (property, movable and immovable) booty seized in any raid or as a result of actual warfare, as well as buried treasure or resources extracted from land, sea, or mines. Others, such as Abu Ubayd and Qardawi, say the khums applies to any windfall for Muslims, but not to income as is the case according to Shia scholars.Robert W. McGee (2011), The Ethics of Tax Evasion: Perspectives in Theory and Practice, Springer, , pp 181 Hanafi The 8th century Hanafi scholar Abu Yusuf stated, according to Abdulaziz Sachedina, that the khums collected was historically distributed into three equal portions: one for Muhammad, which went to the caliph (or sultan) after Muhammad's death; the second portion to the family of Muhammad; and the third portion shared among Muslim orphans, the poor, and wayfarers. Abu Hanifa stated that the portion meant for Muhammad and his family should be used instead for amassing weapons and growing the Muslim army for further raids and wars against unbelievers.Abdulaziz Sachedina (1980), Al-Khums: The Fifth in the ImƒÅmƒ´ Shƒ´ øƒ´ Legal System, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 39, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 278-280 Al-Shaybani interpreted Abu Hanifa to be suggesting that the collected khums tax should be spent equally on Muslim orphans, the poor and warfarers. Maliki Malik ibn Anas, the founder of the Maliki sect of Sunni Islam, stated that the right to spend the khums belonged to the caliph (Imam) after the death of Muhammad, and he had freedom to dispose of the 20% khums tax collected from war booty between the poor and the rich as he wishes, and that he may, if he desired, give any part of the khums tax to Muhammad's family. Shafi'i Al- Shafi‚Äòi, the founder of the Shafii madhhab (school of thought) of Sunni Islam, provided two scenarios on how 20% khums tax on seized raid and war booty was to be spent. He explained that during the time Muhammad was alive, khums was divided into five portions, the first portion was for Allah and his messenger and given to Muhammad, the second portion was for Muhammad's family members, the remaining three to the Muslim poor, orphans and wayfarers. After Muhammad's death, the khums tax was divided into four portions, one for the family of Muhammad, and the other three for the general good of all Muslims. Most Muslim scholars after Al-Shafi'i agreed that a portion of the 20% khums tax should go to the descendants of Muhammad, but they disagreed on who these rightful descendants were. These Islamic scholars also concurred that khums tax should be spent, among other things, to maintain the Muslim army and for the general good of the Muslims. Types According to medieval Shia Muslim scholars Al-Tusi and Al-Hakim, seven items were subject to khums 20% tax: #Al- ghanima, booty seized during a raid and the spoils of war. #Arbdh al-mdkasib, the profit or the surplus of the income. #Al-hardm, Al-haldl, the legitimately earned wealth which has become mixed with illegitimate wealth. #Al-madin, mines and mineral resources extracted anywhere within the Islamic state. #Al- ghaws, objects obtained from sea. #Al-kanz, treasure found. #The land which is transferred to a non-Muslim dhimmi when the latter buys it from a Muslim, and which was previously acquired by the Islamic state by a treaty of surrender by the dhimmis. Sunni scholars have confined the khums 20% tax to apply on only two items,Ali Reza Jalili (2006), A Descriptive Overview of Islamic Taxation, Journal of American Academy of Business, Vol. 8, No. 2, p. 22 #Al-ghanima, ŸäÿπŸÜŸä ÿßŸÑŸÖÿµÿ∑ŸÑÿ≠ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä ÿÆŸèŸÖÿ≥ ÿ≠ÿ±ŸÅŸäÿßŸã ÿßŸÑÿÆŸÖÿ≥.

Fur≈´ by Dierk Lange, The Journal of African History, 31(01), 141-143.Ghanimah Oxford Islamic Studies, Oxford University Press has been interpreted to have several meanings:Zafar Iqbal and Mervyn Lewis, An Islamic Perspective on Governance, , pp. 99-115 #spoils of war, or war booty looted or confiscated from enemy / nonbelievers (of Islam) #profit #minerals or any other form of buried treasureSome scholars disagree that minerals are subject to khums, see: Zafar Iqbal and Mervyn Lewis, An Islamic Perspective on Governance, , pp. 99-115 After paying the 20% khums tax, the remaining 80% of the booty seized, spoils of war and treasure found was distributed among the commanders and soldiers as a reward for their effort, participating in the raid, or going to war against non-Muslims. The origins of the khums, states Abdulaziz Sachedina, go back to \\"the pre-Islamic Arab custom wherein the chief was entitled to one fifth of the ghanima (booty) in addition to the safw al- ndl (the portion of the booty which especially attracted him). The remainder of the booty was normally divided among the raiders who had accompanied the chief, but the latter reserved the right to dispose of the ghanima as he chose\\".Abdulaziz Sachedina (1980), Al-Khums: The Fifth in the ImƒÅmƒ´ Shƒ´ øƒ´ Legal System, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 39, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 277 Distribution As the Quran mentions, khums should be paid to: #Allah: the share of Allah is devoted to the Prophet but some Sunni scholars believe that it should be devoted to the Prophet's relatives or Muslims in general #The Messenger of Allah: the Shia considered it should be paid to the prophet's successor, after his death #The near relative of the Messenger who the Shia know as Imam #The orphans #The needy #Stranded travelers There are no major different views between Shia and Sunni scholars on how to distribute Khums. Khums in history Africa Khums was practiced by Muslim commanders who raided African communities from the 8th century through the early 20th century. However, khums was treated as a concept and the share of booty transferred to the Islamic state was 50%. For example, in 1919, the West African Muslim ruler Hamman Yaji recorded the following in his diary,James H. Vaughan and Anthony H. M. Kirk-Greene (1995), The Diary of Hamman Yaji - Chronicle of a West African Muslim Ruler, Indiana University Press, Similarly, from 8th to 10th century, the Berber people in North Africa were treated as pagans, raided and the booty of seized wealth and slaves were subject to khums.Nabia Abbott, Arabic and Islamic Studies in Honor of Hamilton A. R. Gibb, Editor: George Makdisi, Brill and Harvard University Press, pp. 33-34 Europe From the 8th century onwards, Southern Europe became a target of raids and military campaigns from Morocco and by the Ottoman Sultanate. After the conquest of Cordoba by Muslim armies, khums (20%) of all moveable booty seized from Christians and Jews after the war was transferred to the caliphal treasury, the rest was distributed among the commanders and Muslim soldiers of the invading army.Peter Scales (1994), The Fall of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba: Berbers and Andalusis in Conflict, Brill Academic, , pp. 59-60 and 119-147 According to Musa Nusayr, the army commanders also set aside 20% of land vacated by non-Muslims to the caliph. The land that was surrendered by Christians and Jews, but not vacated, became subject to jizya payable by the dhimmis. However, Ibn Hazm states that Muslim soldiers did not set aside or pay khums from the looted property or riches from the annexed land, each kept the spoils for himself. This became one source of distrust and dispute between the Muslim rulers and clergy based in Africa and the new Caliphate of Cordoba in Southwestern Europe.Nicola Clarke (2012), The Muslim Conquest of Iberia: Medieval Arabic Narratives, Routledge, , pp. 42-49, 131-137 Outside Spain, Ghanima and Fay were sought from Muslim conquests in Sicily, Greece and Caucasian region of Europe. Khums was paid from all seized movable property to the caliphal treasury.Jeremy Johns (2007), Arabic Administration in Norman Sicily: The Royal Diwan, Cambridge University Press, , pp. 22-29 India From the 10th century through the 18th century, Muslim armies raided non-Muslim kingdoms of India. Some of these Muslim armies came from the northwest, consisting of Turko-Mongols, Persians and Afghans. In other times, these were commanders of Delhi Sultanate. War spoils and looted movable property from infidels (Hindus, Jains, Buddhists) was subject to khums. The 20% tax was transferred to the treasury of the sultanate, and the 80% was distributed among the commanders, mounted soldiers and foot soldiers.S. Agarwal, Daan and Other Giving Traditions in India, , Chapter 3 The mounted soldiers were given two to three times as much of the war booty as the foot soldiers. The collected war booty from the treasuries and temples of Hindus were an incentive for war, and the Khums (Ghanima tax) was a source of wealth for the sultans in India. One batch of loot was from Warangal, and it included the Koh-i-noor, one of the largest known diamonds in human history.Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, A History of India, 3rd Edition, Routledge, 1998, See also *Zakat *Qard al-Hassan *Jizya *Kharaj *Nisab *Dhimmi *List of battles of Muhammad *Criticism of Twelver Shia Islam  Notes  References External links * Mu·∏•ammad ibn al-·∏§asan ·π¨≈´sƒ´, , Sections 12 and 13, pages 149-151; 11th Century Shia views on Khums, Ghana'im and Anfal * Abdulaziz Sachedina, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 39, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 275‚Äì289; Al-Khums: The Fifth in the ImƒÅmƒ´ Shƒ´ øƒ´ Legal System *Khums, An Islamic Tax Category:Shia Islam Category:Islamic worship Category:Taxation in Islam Category:Islamic terminology Category:Arabic words and phrases in Sharia Category:Sharia legal terminology ","title":"Khums"},{"id":"1112311","text":"Brading Down is a chalk down southwest of Brading, Isle of Wight.

However, much of the down, approximately , is open to the public and is owned by the Isle of Wight Council and managed by Gift to Nature. The main area of Brading Down is fenced and grazed but access on foot and for horse riders is available from the many pathways entering the area, and the car parks bordering the main Newport to Brading Road. The thin chalk soils to the east of the site support a typical downland plant community with pyramidal orchids being a particular feature in the summer. In recent years, a programme of scrub clearance has been undertaken. The area is good for butterflies including common blue, chalkhill blue, small, large and dingy skippers, marbled white, gatekeeper, and meadow brown. In addition to the wildlife interest of chalk downland, the ancient field system on Brading Down is a Scheduled Monument. The finest surviving ancient field system on the Island is to be found on the down. This is likely to be of late Iron Age or Roman date and highlights the last time the fields were ploughed.

Early life and education Wynn grew up in the Eastern North Carolina community of Robersonville. He holds degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Bachelor of Arts, Journalism, 1975); Marquette University Law School (Juris Doctor, 1979) and University of Virginia School of Law (Master of Laws, Judicial Process, 1995). Early career Following graduation from law school, Wynn served in the Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Navy on active duty for four years - stationed at Navy Base, Norfolk, Virginia. He continued his service for 26 more years in the Navy Reserve which included service as a military judge. He retired in 2009 at rank of Captain. After completing his initial duty of four years in the Navy, Wynn practiced law in Wilson and Greenville, North Carolina. Judicial career From 1990 until his 2010 senate confirmation to serve on the United States Court of Appeals, 4th Circuit, Wynn served on both the North Carolina Court of Appeals and Supreme Court of North Carolina. In the American Bar Association, Wynn served as Chair of the Appellate Judges Conference and the Judicial Division.

Wynn's nomination never received a hearing from the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. Renomination under Obama President Barack Obama nominated Wynn and North Carolina Superior Court Judge Albert Diaz for seats on the Fourth Circuit on Nov. 4, 2009. Obama's renomination of Wynn and nomination of Diaz were jointly endorsed by North Carolina senators Kay Hagan, a Democrat, and Richard Burr, a Republican.Diana Smith, North Carolina Lawyer's Weekly, reprinted in Virginia Lawyer's Weekly, November 9, 2009, Vol. 24, No. 23, p. 3. His nomination was confirmed by the full Senate on August 5, 2010 by unanimous consent. He received his commission on August 10, 2010. Notable cases During his tenure on the Supreme Court of North Carolina, Judge Wynn authored the opinion abolishing the longstanding invitee/licensee framework for evaluating premises liability claims and replaced that framework with a new standard under which property owners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors. Nelson v. Freeland, 349 N.C. 615 (1998). Judge Wynn authored one of the first opinions applying the plausibility pleading standard set forth in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), to an attempted monopolization case under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Industries, 637 F.3d 435 (4th Cir. 2011). The opinion discusses at length what types of facts a complaint must allege to sufficiently plead a relevant geographic market. In a concurring opinion in Liberty University, Inc. v. Geithner, 671 F.3d 391 (4th Cir. 2011), Judge Wynn determined that Congress had the authority to establish the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act pursuant to its plenary taxing power. The Supreme Court subsequently upheld the individual mandate under that theory. In 2014, Judge Wynn wrote the majority opinion preliminarily enjoining implementation of two components of a voting law enacted by the North Carolina General Assembly after the Supreme Court effectively struck down a component of the Voting Rights Act that had long prevented North Carolina from enacting voting laws that denied minority groups equal access.

Judge Wynn later concurred in an opinion holding that the General Assembly enacted several components of the law, including a voter ID provision, with invidious discriminatory intent, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In that case, Judge Wynn wrote the majority opinion as to remedy, immediately and permanently enjoining the State from using those unconstitutional provisions. Judge Wynn wrote a concurring and dissenting opinion in United States v. Graham, 824 F.3d 421 (4th Cir. 2016) (en banc), arguing that cell site location information is not voluntarily conveyed by cell phone users and therefore that cell site location information is protected by the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court subsequently agreed with Judge Wynn's position. Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018). In August 2016, Judge Wynn authored an opinion for a three-judge district court panel striking down dozens of districts in North Carolina's 2011 state legislative districting plans as racial gerrymanders in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court affirmed that decision without dissent. Judge Wynn authored a pair of opinions establishing a new framework for determining whether two entities are joint employers for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Salinas v. Commercial Interiors, Inc., 848 F.3d 125 (4th Cir. 2017); Hall v. DirecTV, LLC, 846 F.3d 757 (4th Cir. 2017). In October 2017, Wynn joined the panel majority when it found that the Bladensburg Peace Cross memorial from World War I now violated the Constitution's Establishment Clause, and he wrote a concurrence when the divided circuit denied rehearing en banc.. The judgement was then reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States in American Legion v. American Humanist Association (2019). In Int'l Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump (2017), Judge Wynn wrote a concurring opinion contending that President Trump's Travel Ban exceeded the President's authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act because it denied entry to a class of aliens on the basis of individious discrimination. Judge Wynn's opinion was grounded in the interpretive principle that absent a clear statement by Congress, courts should not construe a delegation of congressional power as authorizing the delegates to exercise that power in a manner that curtails or dilutes fundamental rights. In January 2018, Judge Wynn wrote the majority opinion for a three-judge panel which struck down North Carolina's congressional districts on grounds that the state's 2016 districting plan constituted a partisan gerrymander in violation of Article I of the Constitution, and the First and Fourteenth Amendments. After the Supreme Court vacated Judge Wynn's panel opinion for reconsideration in light of Gill v. Whitford, 138 S.Ct. 1916 (2018), Judge Wynn authored a revised majority opinion for the three-judge panel again finding that North Carolina's 2016 congressional districting plan violates the Constitution. In April 2018, Wynn dissented when the court found that a Maryland law prohibiting price gouging in prescription drug prices violated the constitution‚Äôs Dormant Commerce Clause.. In August 2020, Wynn joined the majority in G. G. v. Gloucester County School Board. In a 2-1 decision, the court ruled for Gavin Grimm, a transgender man who had sued the Gloucester County School Board in Virginia who had prohibited him from using the boy's bathroom. Judge Henry Floyd wrote for the majority that ‚ÄúAt the heart of this appeal is whether equal protection and Title IX can protect transgender students from school bathroom policies that prohibit them from affirming their gender. We join a growing consensus of courts in holding that the answer is resoundingly yes.‚Äù Judge Wynn, concurring, wrote \\"In particular, the Board‚Äôs classification on the basis of ‚Äúbiological gender‚Äù‚Äîdefined in this appeal as the sex marker on a student‚Äôs birth certificate‚Äîis arbitrary and provides no consistent reason to assign transgender students to bathrooms on a binary male/female basis. Rather, the Board‚Äôs use of ‚Äúbiological gender‚Äù to classify students has the effect of shunting individuals like Grimm‚Äîwho may not use the boys‚Äô bathrooms because of their ‚Äúbiological gender,‚Äù and who cannot use the girls‚Äô bathrooms because of their gender identity‚Äîto a third category of bathroom altogether: the ‚Äúalternative appropriate private facilit[ies]‚Äù established in the policy for ‚Äústudents with gender identity issues.‚Äù That is indistinguishable from the sort of separate-but-equal treatment that is anathema under our jurisprudence. No less than the recent historical practice of segregating Black and white restrooms, schools, and other public accommodations, the unequal treatment enabled by the Board‚Äôs policy produces a vicious and ineradicable stigma.\\" Publications *Judging the Judges, Marquette University Law Review, 86 Marq.L.Rev. 753, Spring 2003 *Military Courts and the All Writs Act: Who Supervises the Military Justice System?, Judges Journal, American Bar Association, Vol. 45, No. 3. *Selection of State Judges, 33 U.Tol.

Sir John Yeamans, 1st Baronet (1611‚Äì1674) was an English colonial administrator described in his day as \\"a pirate ashore\\". He was an early leader and governor of the Province of Carolina. Life Baptised on 28 February 1611 in Bristol, England, Sir John Yeamans was a younger son of John Yeamans, a brewer of Redcliffe, Bristol who died about 1645, and his wife Blanche Germain. The younger Yeamans was a colonel in the Royalist army during the English Civil War. In about 1650 Yeamans migrated to Barbados, and within a decade he had become a large landholder there (he had held land in Barbados since 1638) a colonel of the militia, judge of a local court of common pleas, and by July 1660 he was on the council of that colony. Carolina A map of the Province of Carolina In the deteriorating economic conditions of the 1660s and 1670s many Barbadian planters sought better opportunities. In 1663 a number of planters in Barbados made arrangements with the proprietors of Carolina for establishing a colony at Cape Fear. The proprietors, by the exercise of their influence at court, secured a baronetcy for Yeamans, conferred on him 12 January 1665, and on 11 January 1665 they appointed him governor of their colony, with a jurisdiction extending from Cape Fear to San Mateo. The region was named Clarendon County. Yeamans was also instructed to explore the coast south of Cape Fear. He sailed with three vessels from Barbados in January 1665, and reached Cape Fear, but sustained heavy loss on the way from rough weather. Accordingly, he soon returned to Barbados, leaving the management of the new settlement to a deputy, Captain Robert Sandford (whose lieutenant was Joseph Woory, Yeamans's nephew).When in 1667 Locke drew up for Carolina a fantastic paper constitution entitled the \\"fundamental constitution\\", which was never exactly applied, Yeamans was created a landgrave . However the colonists abandoned Clarendon by the autumn of 1667. In 1669 another attempt at colonisation was made. Three ships of settlers were sent to Port Royal Island from the British Isles calling first at Barbados. Instructed by the proprietors to name a governor Yeamans named himself and joined the expedition until it reached Bermuda. In Bermuda he appointed the elderly William Sayle in his place and abruptly returned to Barbados. The expedition continued and successfully founded South Carolina's first permanent English settlement in April 1670. Sayle died in March 1671. Before his death he nominated as his successor the deputy governor, Joseph West, cites Cal. State Papers, America and West Indies, 1669‚Äì74, p. 472. and this appointment was approved by the colonists. Yeamans arrived in the new colony in 1671 and was disappointed not to be made governor immediately, and used his position as speaker of the colonies first parliament to harass West. He also started to build a plantation into which he brought 200 African slaves. \\"In 1671, Sir John Yeamans, whom we have met in North Carolina, joined the colony, bringing with him about two hundred African slaves\\" On 21 August 1671 the proprietors, to the great dissatisfaction of the colonists, appointed Yeamans to the governorship. He was proclaimed Governor of the English Province of Carolina at Charles Town on 19 April 1672. Early in his governorship at the bequest of the proprietors he initiated a land survey for what would become Charles Town and expanded his plantation. The colony during his governorship suffered from internal dissensions, and was threatened both by the Spaniards and the Indians. The proprietors found fault with Yeamans as extravagant and indifferent to their interests. The colonists objected to his profits as an exporter of food-stuffs from Barbados. In May 1674 the proprietors replaced Yeamans with his predecessor Joseph West, but Yeamans apparently died before he received the notice. The minutes of the colony's Grand Council show that Yeamans presided as governor over a meeting on 3 August 1674, but minutes for the next meeting on 13 August 1674 report that Yeamans had died.Smith, Henry A. M. \\"Sir John Yeamans, an Historical Error\\". The South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine, vol. 19, no. 3, 1918, pp. 152‚Äì156. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27569464.Salley, A.

Yeamans family Sir John Yeamans married twice: firstly to ‚Äì Limp, with whom he had five sons, and secondly on 11 April 1661 to Margaret Berringer, they had four children (two sons and two daughters). It is likely that Yeamans had Benjamin Berringer, his former business partner and husband of Margaret, poisoned just weeks before the marriage. However the death was investigated and Yeamans was cleared by the council. Yeamans' many descendants were still in prominent positions in West Indies affairs at the start of the 20th century. John's younger brother, Robert, also received a baronetcy on 31 December 1666 but he left no children. Yeamans' connection with the colony is still commemorated by the ancient mansion of Yeamans Hall, on Goose Creek, near Charleston. Sir John's considerable wealth in Barbados passed to his son, Major Sir William Yeamans, second baronet, and great-grandfather of Sir John Yeamans of Barbados, whose son, Sir Robert (d. 19 February 1788), was the last baronet. Lieutenant Colonel Josiah Martin, the last colonial governor of the Province of North Carolina was a member of the same West Indies Yeamans family. Yeamans was one of a large, often prominent, family named Yeamans or Yeomans of Bristol, England some of whom later became Quakers. One prominent member of the family was Robert Yeamans a sheriff of Bristol. In 1643 he plotted to seize a city gate and let in a Royalist army to overwhelm the Parliamentary garrison. The plot was discovered and he along with some fellow conspirators were executed by the Parliamentary military governor for treason. Robert Yeamans was not a close relation of Sir John.Therefore the relationship reported in Burke in A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies is incorrect .

The battle is described in Genesis as consisting of four kings, led by Chedorlaomer of Elam (Amraphel, Arioch, Chedolaomer, and Tidal), engaging in a punitive expedition against five kings of Canaan who rebelled against Chedorlaomer (Bera, Birsha, Shinab, Shemeber, and the king of Bela). The same story is also mentioned in the Book of Jubilees, where Arioch is called \\"king of Sellasar\\". As in the case of other stories from the Book of Genesis, the consensus of modern scholarship is that these stories do not constitute reliable history.  Arioch and Eleasar  Some historians have placed the area where Arioch ruled in Asia Minor, but theories as to its specific locations differ, with some claiming it was in Pontus while others cite Cappadocia and Antioch. There are also sources which associated Ellasar with the kingdom of Larsa and suggested that Arioch could be one of its kings called Eri-Aku, an Akkadian translation for the name Rim-Sin, where rim meant servant and Sin is the Semitic name of the moon god (Agu or Aku in Akkadian). By the 20th century, this theory became popular so that it was common to identify Arioch with Eriaku ‚Äî through the alternative reading of either Rim- Sin or his brother Warad-Sin, who were both believed to be contemporary with Hammurabi.Price, Ira, 1904.

Some of these vehicles were deployed by Qatar during the first Gulf War, and this is the only known combat use of this vehicle. An Israeli M51 Sherman fitted with the CN-105 D1 gun.

Under this configuration, the gun saw extensive combat use in the 1967 Six Days War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War, scoring many victories in engagements with Syrian and Egyptian forces. In order to fit in the T23 turret of the M51, a larger muzzle brake was added to reduce the recoil length. The ammunition was a modified version of that used in the 105 mm Mod√®le F1 gun fitted to the AMX-30 MBT, using shorter cartridges cases. These were manufactured locally under license by Israel Military Industries. Argentina also produced a similar version of this gun, similar to the Israeli version, for use on their Repotenciado upgrade of ex-British Sherman Firefly tanks, known locally as the L44/57 FTR 105 mm. Although these tanks still had the original smaller Sherman turret, the extended Firefly bustle gave enough space for the recoil within a limited elevation arc, but left a very cramped turret. Ammunition was sourced from Fabricaciones Militares. Many Israeli M51s were sold to Chile in the 1980s and continued in use into the mid-1990s. Together with the Argentine Repotenciado, these represented the swansong of the Sherman series as a gun tank, more than half a century after entering service.

Biography Hatcher received his Ph.D. under the supervision of Hans Samelson at Stanford University in 1971. He went on to become a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Since 1983 he has been a professor at Cornell University. Mathematical contributions He has worked in geometric topology, both in high dimensions, relating pseudoisotopy to algebraic K-theory, and in low dimensions: surfaces and 3-manifolds, such as proving the Smale conjecture for the 3-sphere. 3-manifolds Perhaps among his most recognized results in 3-manifolds concern the classification of incompressible surfaces in certain 3-manifolds and their boundary slopes. William Floyd and Hatcher classified all the incompressible surfaces in punctured-torus bundles over the circle. William Thurston and Hatcher classified the incompressible surfaces in 2-bridge knot complements. As corollaries, this gave more examples of non-Haken, non-Seifert fibered, irreducible 3-manifolds and extended the techniques and line of investigation started in Thurston's Princeton lecture notes. Hatcher also showed that irreducible, boundary-irreducible 3-manifolds with toral boundary have at most \\"half\\" of all possible boundary slopes resulting from essential surfaces. In the case of one torus boundary, one can conclude that the number of slopes given by essential surfaces is finite. Hatcher has made contributions to the so-called theory of essential laminations in 3-manifolds. He invented the notion of \\"end-incompressibility\\" and several of his students, such as Mark Brittenham, Charles Delman, and Rachel Roberts, have made important contributions to the theory. Surfaces Hatcher and Thurston exhibited an algorithm to produce a presentation of the mapping class group of a closed, orientable surface. Their work relied on the notion of a cut system and moves that relate any two systems.

He held the County of Barcelona concomitantly with Septimania. Berengar was a member of the family of the Unrochids. He was the son of Unruoch II of Friuli and Ingeltrude and brother of Eberhard. His nephew was the Holy Roman Emperor Berengar. In 814, Louis the Pious installed Berengar as Count of Toulouse in succession to Raymond Raphinel who had been appointed by Charlemagne. He was also a councillor of Pepin I of Aquitaine in 816. In 819, he and Guerin, Count of Auvergne, fought against the usurping Duke of Gascony, Lupo III Centule. Berengar appears as a missus dominicus of Louis in May 825 and then in 827 in the six counties of Rheims, Soissons, Senlis, Beauvais, Laon, and Catolonis and the four bishoprics of Amiens, Cambrai, Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, and Noviomacensem. In November 831, Pepin revolted against his father, with Berengar advising him not to rebel, but with Bernard of Septimania inciting him. In the beginning of 832, Louis the Pious began campaigning against his rebellious son. Berengar, loyal to the Emperor, attacked the domains of Bernard, taking Roussillon (with Vallespir), Raz√®s, and Conflent. On 2 February, Berengar had already reached Elna. Finally, in the autumn of the same year, successive victories by the imperial forces compelled Pepin and Bernard to appear before the Emperor (October) to plead for peace. Pepin was dispossessed of his kingdom and sent, as a prisoner, to Trier. His territories were given to Charles the Bald, youngest son of the Emperor. Bernard was accused of infidelity and dispossessed of all his lands in Septimania and Gothia; they were given to Berengar. Gaucelm, Bernard's brother, was also dispossessed of the majority of his lands, but for a time kept the Emp√∫ries although this too was lost to Berengar later. In 833, Aznar I Gal√≠ndez, Count of Urgell and Cerdanya, usurped the counties of Pallars and Ribagorza from under Berengar's rule. In 834, when another rebellious son of the emperor, Lothair, was defeated, Bernard, having fought on the side of Louis with Pepin, reclaimed his old domains as the price of his support. The lands were passed to Bernard and Berengar was weakened. As a result Berengar's Pyrenean lands were confiscated unlawfully and redistributed by the imperial crown to others. His Catalan grants were taken away and given to his old enemy. He was left with nothing but the County of Toulouse after fighting loyally for the old emperor and the successful Pepin. In June 835, Bernard and Berengar were summoned to an Assembly at Cr√©mieu, near Lyon, where a decision would be made about the distribution of lands in Septimania and Gothia, but on the way Berengar died unexpectedly. Thus the decision was simplified, and the Emperor gave the region's counties to Bernard and Toulouse to Guerin.

Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court that involved a Second Amendment challenge to the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA). The case is often cited in the ongoing US gun politics debate, as both sides claim that it supports their position. Background The case involved a criminal prosecution under the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA). Passed in response to public outcry over the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the NFA requires certain types of firearms, such as fully and automatic firearms and short-barrelled rifles and shotguns, to be registered with the Miscellaneous Tax Unit, which was later folded into what eventually became the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), then part of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the ancestor of today's Internal Revenue Service. The $200 tax was to be paid at the time of registration and again if the firearm was ever sold. The defendants Jack Miller and Frank Layton were indicted on charges of unlawfully and feloniously transporting in interstate commerce from Oklahoma to Arkansas an unregistered double barrel 12-gauge shot gun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length, in violation of the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C.S. ¬ß 1132c et seq. (\\"Act\\"). At trial in federal district court, the defendants filed a demurrer to the indictment alleging that the Act was not a revenue measure but an attempt to usurp police power reserved to the states and so was unconstitutional. Defendants further argued that the Act violated the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. The district court held that the section of the Act that made it unlawful to transport an unregistered firearm in interstate commerce was unconstitutional as violative of the Second Amendment. It accordingly sustained the demurrer and quashed the indictment. The government took a direct appeal to the Supreme Court. In reality, Ragon was in favor of the gun control law and ruled the law unconstitutional because he knew that Miller, who was a known bank robber and had just testified against the rest of his gang in court, would have to go into hiding as soon as he was released. He knew that Miller would not pay a lawyer to argue the case at the Supreme Court and would simply disappear. Therefore, the government's appeal to the Supreme Court would surely be a victory because Miller and his attorney would not even be present at the argument. United States v. Miller, 26 F. Supp. 1002 (W.D. Ark. 1939) On March 30, 1939, the Supreme Court heard the case. Attorneys for the United States argued four points: #The NFA is intended as a revenue-collecting measure and so is within the authority of the Department of the Treasury. #The defendants transported the shotgun from Oklahoma to Arkansas and so used it in interstate commerce. #The Second Amendment protects only the ownership of military-type weapons appropriate for use in an organized militia. #The \\"double barrel 12-gauge Stevens shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length, bearing identification number 76230,\\" was never used in any militia organization. Neither the defendants nor their legal counsel appeared at the Supreme Court. A lack of financial support and procedural irregularities prevented counsel from traveling. Miller was found shot to death in April, before the decision had been rendered. Decision On May 15, 1939, the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice McReynolds, decided on the National Firearms Act, as applied to one indicted for transporting in interstate commerce a 12-gauge shotgun with a barrel less than 18 inches long without having registered it and without having in his possession a stamp-affixed written order for it, as required by the Act: > # Not unconstitutional as an invasion of the reserved powers of the States. > Citing Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U. S. 506, and Narcotic Act cases. P. > 307 U. S. 177. The conclusion was in the favor of the NFA. # Not violative > of the Second Amendment of the Federal Constitution. P. 307 U. S. 178. The > Court cannot take judicial notice that a shotgun having a barrel less than > 18 inches long has today any reasonable relation to the preservation or > efficiency of a well regulated militia, and therefore cannot say that the > Second Amendment guarantees to the citizen the right to keep and bear such a > weapon. In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or > use of a \\"shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length\\" at > this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency > of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment > guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is > not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary > military equipment, or that its use could contribute to the common defense. In addition, Justice McReynolds wrote: > With obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the > effectiveness of such forces the declaration and guarantee of the Second > Amendment were made. It must be interpreted and applied with that end in > view.The Second Amendment: A Biography, Michael Waldman, Page 83 Interpretations Gun control advocates argue that for over six decades, the United States Circuit Courts, with very few exceptions, have cited Miller in rejecting challenges to federal firearms regulations. Gun rights advocates claim the case as a victory because they interpret it to state that ownership of weapons for efficiency or the preservation of a well-regulated militia unit is specifically protected. Furthermore, they frequently point out that short- barreled shotguns (with 20 inch barrels) have been commonly used in warfare, and the statement made by the judges indicates that they were not made aware of the fact. Because the defense did not appear, there was arguably no way for judges to know otherwise. Two of the justices involved in the decision had prior military experience, Justice Black as a Captain in the field artillery during World War I and Justice Frankfurter as a Major in the Army legal service; however, there is no way to know if they were personally aware of the use of shotguns by American troops. During World War I, between 30,000 and 40,000 short-barreled pump-action shotguns were purchased by the US Ordnance Department and saw service in the trenches and for guarding German prisoners. Some argue that fundamental issues related to the case were never truly decided because the Supreme Court remanded the case to the federal district court for \\"further proceedings,\\" which never took place. By the time of the Supreme Court decision, Miller had been killed, and since Layton made a plea bargain after the decision was handed down, there was no claimants left to continue legal proceedings. The US Supreme Court has mentioned Miller in only seven subsequent cases: Konigsberg (1961); Atlanta Motel (1964); Adams (1972); Lewis (1980); Printz (1997); Heller (2008) and McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010); Justice James Clark McReynolds authored the decision in United States v. Miller, the only Supreme Court case that directly involved the Second Amendment until District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008. Here are the Supreme Court's interpretations of the 1939 Miller opinion: ;Konigsberg v. State Bar (1961); Footnote 10 :That view, which of course cannot be reconciled with the law relating to libel, slander, misrepresentation, obscenity, perjury, false advertising, solicitation of crime, complicity by encouragement, conspiracy, and the like, is said to be compelled by the fact that the commands of the First Amendment are stated in unqualified terms: \\"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble\\". But as Mr. Justice Holmes once said: \\"[T]he provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form; they are organic living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is vital not formal; it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth.\\" Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, 610. However, compare the qualified language of the Second Amendment: \\"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\\" And see United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174. ;Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States (1964); (concurring opinion of Black; Footnote 11): \\"... cases in which the commerce power has been used to advance other ends not entirely commercial: e. g., ... United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (National Firearms Act); ;Adams v. Williams (1972); (dissenting opinion of Douglas, joined by Marshall) :The leading case is United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, upholding a federal law making criminal the shipment in interstate commerce of a sawed-off shotgun. The law was upheld, there being no evidence that a sawed-off shotgun had \\"some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\\". Id., at 178. The Second Amendment, it was held, \\"must be interpreted and applied\\" with the view of maintaining a \\"militia\\". :Critics say that proposals like this water down the Second Amendment. Our decisions belie that argument, for the Second Amendment, as noted, was designed to keep alive the militia. ;Lewis v. United States (1980); Footnote 8 :(the Second Amendment guarantees no right to keep and bear a firearm that does not have \\"some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\\"); United States v. Three Winchester 30-30 Caliber Lever Action Carbines, 504 F.2d 1288, 1290, n. 5 (CA7 1974); United States v. Johnson, 497 F.2d 548 (CA4 1974); Cody v. United States, 460 F.2d 34 (CA8), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1010 (1972) (the latter three cases holding, respectively, that 1202 (a) (1), 922 (g), and 922 (a) (6) do not violate the Second Amendment). ;Printz v. United States (1997) (concurring opinion of Thomas) :Our most recent treatment of the Second Amendment occurred in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), in which we reversed the District Court's invalidation of the National Firearms Act, enacted in 1934. In Miller, we determined that the Second Amendment did not guarantee a citizen's right to possess a sawed off shotgun because that weapon had not been shown to be \\"ordinary military equipment\\" that could \\"contribute to the common defense\\". Id., at 178. The Court did not, however, attempt to define, or otherwise construe, the substantive right protected by the Second Amendment. ;District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) :\\"Miller stands only for the proposition that the Second Amendment right, whatever its nature, extends only to certain types of weapons. It is particularly wrongheaded to read Miller for more than what it said, because the case did not even purport to be a thorough examination of the Second Amendment...We therefore read Miller to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law- abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short-barreled shotguns.\\" See also *Firearm case law in the United States *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 307 References Further reading   External links  Category:1939 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Hughes Court Category:United States Second Amendment case law Category:Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ","title":"United States v.

Fandom  Tucker became involved in science fiction fandom in 1932, publishing a fanzine, The Planetoid. From 1938 to 2001, he published the fanzine Le Zombie, which lasted for more than 60 issues and was later revived as a webzine. (The title arising from the fact that on multiple occasions fallacious reports of his death were made within fandom.Katz, Arnie. \\"Philosophical Theory of Fanhistory\\" in Fan History Archive .) He also published the Bloomington News Letter, which dealt with news within the professional science fiction writing field. Active in letter-writing as well, Tucker was a popular fan during more than six decades, coining many words and phrases familiar in science fiction fandom and to literary criticism of the field. In addition to \\"Bob Tucker\\", he was also known to write under the pseudonym \\"Hoy Ping Pong\\" (generally reserved for humorous pieces.)Robert Bloch. \\"Wilson Tucker - The Smo-o-oth Operator\\" in Bloch's Out of My Head, Cambridge MA: NESFA Press, 1986. During a 41-year period, 1955 to 1996, Tucker created and edited eight separate editions of The Neo-Fan's Guide To Science Fiction Fandom, an historical overview of the first five decades of science fiction fandom, with important events and trends in fandom noted. Each edition also carried a lexicon of fan terminology in use throughout fandom at the time. The eighth and final edition remains in print from the Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society. Tucker's fanzine writing has been described as \\"unfailingly incisive\\", and Tucker as \\"the most intelligent and articulate and sophisticated fan the American science-fiction community is ever likely to boast of\\".Clute, John \\"Wilson Tucker: Writer of bleak science fiction.\\" The Independent 12 Oct. 2006 He helped pioneer criticism of the genre, coining along the way terms like \\"space opera\\" in common use today. He was fan guest of honor, professional guest of honor, toastmaster, or master of ceremonies at so many science fiction conventions over nearly seven decades that no one has managed to compile a comprehensive list. Notable are his appearances as guest of honor at Torcon I (the 1948 Worldcon) and NyCon3 (the 1967 Worldcon), a perennial stint as toastmaster of the long-running Midwestcon and LibertyCon, and as toastmaster at MidAmeriCon, the 1976 Worldcon. In 1940, he served on the committee of the Worldcon in Chicago. In 2001, he co-hosted the joint Ditto/FanHistoriCon held in his hometown of Bloomington, Illinois. Tucker won the Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer in 1970 and the 1954 Retro-Hugo for the same category in 2004. His Science Fiction Newsletter (a.k.a. Bloomington News Letter) won the Retro-Hugo Award for Best Fanzine for 1951. His fanzine Le Zombie also won the 1943 Retro Hugo for Best Fanzine at Worldcon 76 in San Jose, CA. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Tucker in 2003, its eighth class of two deceased and two living writers. Other honors included the 1986 Skylark (annual Edward E. Smith Memorial Award for Imaginative Fiction), the 1996 Author Emeritus of the Science Fiction Writers of America, and the First Fandom Hall of Fame Award. Tuckercon, the 2007 NASFiC (North American Science Fiction Convention) in Collinsville, Illinois, was dedicated to Tucker.  Career  Although he would eventually sell more than 20 novels, Tucker made his principal living as a movie projectionist and theater electrician, starting as a prop man at the Majestic Theater in Bloomington, Illinois. He served as President of Local 193 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), and retired as a projectionist in 1972.  Professional writing  In 1941, Tucker's first professional short story, \\"Interstellar Way Station\\", was published by Frederik Pohl in the May issue of Super Science Stories. Between 1941 and 1979, primarily in the early 1940s and early 1950s, he produced about two dozen more. He also turned his attention to writing novels, with 11 mystery novels and a dozen science fiction novels to his credit. His most famous novel may be The Year of the Quiet Sun (1970). It was runner-up for the Locus Award for Best Novel and a finalist for the Hugo and the Nebula Award. In 1976 it won a special retrospective John W. Campbell Memorial Award (established 1973 for 1972 novels). Other notable novels include The Lincoln Hunters (1958), in which time-travelers from an oppressive future society seek to record Abraham Lincoln's \\"lost speech\\" of May 19, 1856. It contains a vivid description of Lincoln and his time, seen through the eyes of a future American who feels that Lincoln and his time compare very favorably with the traveler's own. The Long Loud Silence (1952) is a post-apocalypse story in which the eastern third of the United States is quarantined as the result of an atomic and bacteriological attack. Damon Knight called it \\"a phenomenally good book; in its own terms, it comes as near perfection as makes no difference.\\" Much of Tucker's short fiction was collected in The Best of Wilson Tucker (Timescape, 1982; ). Tucker's habit of using the names of friends for minor characters in his fiction led to the literary term \\"tuckerization\\" or \\"tuckerism(s)\\". For example, Tucker named a character after Lee Hoffman in his novel The Long Loud Silence, after Robert Bloch in The Lincoln Hunters, and after Walt Willis in Wild Talent.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1999, in the Progressive Conservative Party caucus. From 1988 to 1999, McCrae was a cabinet minister in the government of Premier Gary Filmon. McCrae was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was educated at Vincent Massey High School in Brandon, Manitoba and the Bryan College of Court Reporting in Los Angeles, California. He served as a court reporter for a number of years, and was a Hansard reporter for the House of Commons of Canada from 1975 to 1982. McCrae served as a city councillor for Brandon City Council from 1983 to 1986. Provincial politics McCrae was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election, defeating New Democratic Party candidate Arnold Grambo by 1409 votes in the riding of Brandon West. The NDP under Howard Pawley narrowly won the election, and McCrae joined 25 other Progressive Conservatives in the opposition. In 1988, the Pawley government was brought down by disgruntled NDP backbencher Jim Walding. The Progressive Conservatives won a minority government in the election that followed; McCrae was re-elected over Liberal candidate John Worley by 1421 votes, with the NDP falling to third place. On May 9, 1988, McCrae was appointed Attorney General (renamed Minister of Justice and Attorney General) in 1990, Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and Minister of Cooperative Development, with responsibility for Constitutional Affairs and the Liquor Control Act. On April 21, 1989, he was relieved of all his ministries and responsibilities except for the primary portfolio of Attorney-General. McCrae was easily re-elected in the 1990 provincial election, defeating NDP candidate and future Brandon mayor Shari Decter Hirst. He was kept in the Justice portfolio and once again given responsibility for constitutional affairs and the Liquor Control Act, as well as Corrections and most of The Corrections Act. As Justice Minister, McCrae was responsible for implementing Canada's first administrative license suspension program for impaired drivers. On constitutional matters, he declared that Manitoba would assist in bringing about aboriginal self- government. Following a cabinet shuffle on September 10, 1993, McCrae was named as Manitoba's Minister of Health. He was again re-elected without difficulty in the 1995 provincial election. During his time as Health Minister, McCrae made the controversial decision to shut down the emergency rooms in Winnipeg's community hospitals in favour of more centralized E.R. services. A further cabinet shuffle on January 6, 1997 made McCrae Minister of Environment and Government House Leader, with responsibility for the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act. As Environment Minister, McCrae was criticized by the Sierra Club for refusing to bring in plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the final cabinet shuffle of Filmon's government on February 5, 1999, he was named Minister of Education and Training. Filmon's Conservatives were defeated by the New Democratic Party under Gary Doer in the 1999 provincial election. Notwithstanding his long service in government, McCrae lost Brandon West by 352 votes to Scott Smith of the NDP. After provincial politics After leaving the assembly, McCrae became a real estate agent. He ran for Mayor of Brandon in 2002, but lost to Dave Burgess. His campaign was hindered by local opposition to some of the decisions he had made while in government. He did not seek re-election to the provincial legislature in 2003. He was re-elected to Brandon City Council in October 2006 after a 20-year hiatus. He also wrote a book in 2006, Dancing Winds, a romance set during the second World War at a concentration camp. McCrae was acclaimed to city council in 2010. In April 2013, McCrae resigned from Brandon City Council. In May, he was named a part-time Citizenship Judge for Winnipeg.

His identity is uncertain. Aiss√≥ is thought to have been either a Goth and former lieutenant of the disposed Count Ber√†, or an Arab (Ayxun ibn Sulayman ibn Yaqdhan al-Arab√≠), the son of Sulayman al-Arabi who had been imprisoned in Aachen after being captured by Frankish forces at Girona. After Bernat of Septimania was anointed Count of Barcelona, Aisso joined the revolt against the new count. Only the castle of Roda de Ter, in the county of Ausona, resisted and was destroyed by revolters. Many Goth nobles joined Aiss√≥ and Guillem√≥ (or Guillemundus) son of Ber√† and Count of Rasez and Conflent. Aiss√≥ raided the County of Cerdanya and the region of Vall√©s from his base in the centre of Catalonia. The young Count Bernat requested and received some help from the Emperor, as well as from some local Goth noblemen or \\"Hispani\\" (826). Faced with this opposition, Aiss√≥ appealed to the sole power that could be compared to the Franks, the Emir of C√≥rdoba. He sent a deputation, led by his brother, to request help from Abd ar-Rahman II. He sent his General, Ubayd Allah (also known as Abu Marwan), who arrived in Zaragoza in May 827. From there, his forces entered the territory of the County of Barcelona, reaching the City of Barcelona later that summer. The City was besieged without success; however, the surroundings were ransacked. The army then moved to Girona, which was attacked on October 10, 827. When Louis I the Pious heard of the Muslim raid, he ordered to his son Pepin I of Aquitaine, and Counts Hugo of Tours and Matfred of Orleans to recruit an army. However, recruitment was slow and, by the time it was formed, Abu Merwan was already returning south. The rebels fled with them in 826. Aiss√≥ probably sought refuge in C√≥rdoba, where he was later murdered on the orders of the Emir, who was suspicious of a conspiracy. Guillem√≥ also lived the rest of his life in exile in C√≥rdoba.

Hackleback was launched 30 May 1943 by the Cramp Shipbuilding Co., Philadelphia; sponsored by Mrs. W. L. Wright; and commissioned 7 November 1944, Lt. Comdr. Frederick E. Janney in command. After training out of New London, Hackleback reported to the Fleet Sonar School at Key West 24 December. Two weeks training there were followed by further training at Balboa, Canal Zone, and Hackleback sailed for Pearl Harbor 25 January 1945. The new submarine participated in still more training exercises at Pearl Harbor before departing for her first war patrol 6 March. Japanese merchant shipping had been decimated by the Pacific submarine fleet, and Hackleback was to encounter no suitable targets in any of her patrols. But on this first patrol, she played a key role in the sinking of the last of Japan's super-battleships, the Yamato. Patrolling the Bungo Suido area late in the night of 6 April, Hackleback made radar contact on a fast group of ships at about . She sent a steady stream of location reports back to Pearl Harbor, at the same time attempting to close with the task group. Hackleback three times came to within of the Yamato force, but destroyers forced her out of range before she could get in position to fire torpedoes. Yamato was not to escape, however. The following morning, 7 April, planes from Admiral Mitscher's famous TF 58, guided by Hackleback's contact location reports, struck the Yamato group. In four successive waves, the carrier planes accounted for the destruction of Yamato, the light cruiser Yahagi, and two destroyers, leaving only six destroyers of the Japanese task force to escape. During the rest of her first patrol, Hackleback made two gun attacks on small ships, but discontinued the engagements when it appeared they were trying to lure her in close to shore. Returning to Midway 26 April, she prepared for a second patrol and on 21 May sailed. This time Hackleback's primary mission was lifeguard duty off Sakishima Gunto as the carriers pounded the Japanese home islands. On 22 June she picked up a downed carrier pilot, Lt. Comdr. C. P. Smith. Hackleback also engaged in some shore bombardment. After an air strike on Shokoto Sho 7 July, the submarine closed the island and fired 73 rounds of shells. No surface contacts were made on this patrol. Hackleback returned to Guam 12 July. Sailing for her third war patrol 14 August, the submarine received an unofficial flash \\"Tokyo accepts\\" that same day, and on 16 August headed for Midway. The long Pacific war had ended. Hackleback spent 2 weeks at Midway and then sailed for home, reaching San Francisco 11 September. Hackleback decommissioned there 20 March 1946 and was placed in reserve at Mare Island. Hackleback's classification was changed to AGSS-295 on 6 November 1962. Her name was struck from the Navy List 1 March 1967 and was sold for scrapping, 4 December 1968 to Zidell Explorations, Portland, Ore.

Symbolically, King Leopold II laid the first stone of the basilica in 1905 during the celebrations of the 75th anniversary of Belgian independence. The construction was halted by the two World Wars and finished only in 1969. Belonging to the Metropolitan Archbishopric of Mechelen-Brussels, it is one of the ten largest Roman Catholic churches by area in the world.List of largest church buildings in the world Located in the Parc Elisabeth atop the Koekelberg Hill at the border between Brussels' Koekelberg and Ganshoren municipalities, the church is popularly known as the Koekelberg Basilica (, ). The massive brick and concrete reinforced church features two thin towers and a green copper dome that rises above the ground, dominating Brussels' northwestern skyline. It is served by Simonis metro station on lines 2 and 6 of the Brussels metro. History Cartoon depicting King Leopold 2 of the Belgians laying the first stone of The National Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Brussels In the mid-19th century, King Leopold I dreamed of turning the uninhabited Koekelberg hill into a royal residence area. After his death just before 1880, King Leopold II envisaged building a Belgian Panth√©on dedicated to Great Belgians, inspired by the French Panth√©on in Paris, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence. The King dropped this project due to the lack of enthusiasm of the Belgian population. In 1902, King Leopold II visited the Basilique du Sacr√©-Coeur of Paris and decided to build instead a pilgrimage church, a national sanctuary dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.Vandenbreeden. p. 13 Neo-Gothic Basilica (1905‚Äì1914) Neo-Gothic project of the Basilica by Pierre Langerock (1905) The initial project of Leuven-based architect Pierre Langerock was a sumptuous neo-Gothic church inspired by the \\"ideal cathedral\\" of Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc. King Leopold II laid the first stone on 12 October 1905 during the celebrations commemorating the 75th anniversary of Belgian independence. Financing the construction of the church soon became a problem.Vandenbreeden. p. 17 Only the foundations had been finished when World War I broke out. In his pastoral letter for Christmas 1914, Cardinal Mercier gave the Basilica a new meaning: Art Deco Basilica (1919‚Äì1969) On 29 June 1919, King Albert I and a large crowd associated themselves with this promise in a ceremony on the Koekelberg hill. However it was impossible to resume Langerock's plan due to the state of public finances. A project by architect Albert Van Huffel was adopted. Cardinal Jozef-Ernest van Roey consecrated the unfinished church on 14 October 1935, after obtaining a special authorisation from Pope Pius XI. The cupola was finished in 1969 and, on 11 November 1970, the ceremony for the 25th anniversary of the episcopate of Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens marked the completion of the construction of the Basilica. The final design by architect Albert Van Huffel won the great architecture prize at the Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris. Building The building combines reinforced concrete with terracotta layering, bricks, and dimension stone. It is the largest building in Art Deco style in the world, at high and long (outside length).

Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise, are roughly the Cemetery Belt and the Queens borough line to the north; the Queens borough line to the east; Jamaica Bay to the south, and the Bay Ridge Branch railroad tracks and Van Sinderen Avenue to the west. Linden Boulevard, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Atlantic Avenue are the primary thoroughfares through East New York. East New York was founded as the Town of New Lots in the 1650s. It was annexed as the 26th Ward of the rapidly growing City of Brooklyn in 1886, and became part of New York City in 1898. During the latter part of the twentieth century, East New York came to be predominantly inhabited by African Americans and Latinos. East New York is part of Brooklyn Community District 5, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11207, 11208, and 11239. It is patrolled by the 75th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 2. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council's 37th and 42nd Districts.Current City Council Districts for Kings County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. History Early history and development At the northern edge of what is now East New York, a chain of hills, geologically a terminal moraine, separates northwestern Long Island from Jamaica and the Hempstead Plains, the main part of Long Island's fertile outwash plain. The southern portions of the neighborhood, meanwhile, consisted of salt marshes and several creeks, which drained into Jamaica Bay. These areas were originally settled by the Jameco Native Americans, and later used by the Canarsee and Rockaway tribes as fishing grounds. In the 1650s, Dutch colonists began settling in the eastern sections of Brooklyn, forming the towns of Flatbush, Bushwick, and New Lots (the predecessor to East New York). The area along with the rest of Brooklyn and modern New York City was ceded to the British Empire in 1664. A few 18th Century roads, including the ferry road or Palmer Turnpike from Brooklyn to Jamaica, passed through the chain of hills; hence the area was called \\"Jamaica Pass\\". During the American Revolutionary War invading British and Hessian (German) soldiers ended an all- night forced march at this pass in August 1776 to surprise and flank General George Washington and the Continental Army, to win the Battle of Long Island, (also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of Brooklyn Heights). In 1835, Connecticut merchant John Pitkin (the namesake of Pitkin Avenue) purchased the land of the Town of New Lots north of New Lots Avenue, opening a shoe factory at what is now Williams Street and Pitkin Avenue. Pitkin named the area \\"East New York\\" to signify it as the eastern end of New York City. In 1836 the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad (soon to become part of the Long Island Rail Road) opened through the area; it did not originally stop in East New York, but a stop there was added by 1844. In 1860 the LIRR moved its terminus to Queens, and the line through Brooklyn was shortened to end at East New York. In 1852, New Lots was officially ceded from the Town of Flatbush. In the middle 19th century, the road between Brooklyn and Jamaica became the Brooklyn and Jamaica Plank Road. The Brooklyn and Rockaway Beach Railroad (1865) was built to connect the LIRR's Atlantic Branch with Canarsie at a point later known as Broadway Junction. As often happened at 19th Century railroad junctions, a railway town arose. Sprawling development into recently rustic northern part of the Town of \\"New Lots\\" followed the reach of elevated transit lines into the area: the Jamaica Avenue Line in 1885 and the Fulton Street Line in 1889. The road to Brooklyn was renamed Fulton Street, the one to Jamaica, Jamaica Avenue and the one to Williamsburg, Broadway. Annexation to Brooklyn and 20th century East New York (as the Town of New Lots) was annexed as the 26th Ward of the rapidly growing City of Brooklyn in 1886; in 1898 after a decade-long controversy with debates, campaigns and publicity, the community was merged into New York City as a whole with the consolidation of Brooklyn and the other four boroughs into a single entity as the \\"City of Greater New York\\". In the 20th century its name came to be applied to much of the former township. In 1939, the Works Progress Administration Guide to New York City wrote: After World War II, thousands of manufacturing jobs left New York City thereby increasing the importance of the remaining jobs to those with limited education and job skills. During this same period, large numbers of Puerto Ricans from the Caribbean island and African-Americans from the South emigrated to New York City looking for employment. East New York, no longer replete with the jobs the new residents had come for, was thereby faced with a host of new socioeconomic problems, including widespread unemployment and crime. Social problems Abandoned houses in East New York Since the late 1950s East New York has had some of the highest crime rates in Brooklyn, and is considered by some to be the borough's murder capital, alongside Brownsville. Many social problems associated with poverty from crime to drug addiction have been prevalent in the area for decades. Despite the decline of crime compared to their peaks during the crack and heroin epidemics, violent crime continues to be widespread in the community. East New York's 75th Police Precinct reported the highest murder rate in the city in 2011, according to crime reports compiled by DNAinfo.com. East New York has significantly higher dropout rates and incidences of violence in its schools. Students must pass through metal detectors and swipe ID cards to enter the buildings. Other problems in local schools include low test scores and high truancy rates. Walter Thabit, a city planner for East New York, chronicled in his 2003 book, How East New York Became a Ghetto, the change in population from mostly working class Italians and Jewish residents to residents of Puerto Rican and African American descent. Thabit argues that landlords and real estate agents played a significant role in the downturn of the area. Puerto Ricans were moving en masse to New York City in the late 1950s, at a time when unemployment rates in Puerto Rico soared to 25 percent, and left Puerto Rico on the brink of poverty. Thabit also describes how the construction of public housing projects in East New York further contributed to its decline, noting that many of the developments were built by corrupt managers and contractors. He argues that the city government largely ignored the community when it could have helped turn it around. Writing in the New York Press, Michael Manville accused Thabit of poor research, sweeping generalizations, and a failure to distinguish the actions of racist individuals from the effects of a racist capitalist system, and contends that much of the urban renewal and public housing efforts of the period were in fact well-intentioned, if ill-considered and hubristic.Look Back in Anger: An urban scholar lets fly. , New York Press, Volume 16, Issue 34 Urban renewal East New York was devastated by \\"blockbusting\\" in the course of an FHA Mortgage scandal that left the neighborhood virtually abandoned by the late '70s. A Federal Court ordered that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) be prepared for East New York. The history of the FHA Mortgage Scandal and its unfolding in East New York was documented via that EIS, which was developed by the Brooklyn Office of the New York City Department of City Planning. The EIS found that what happened in East New York and inner city communities across America was a result of the FHA's inability to respond to its new mandate to include inner city neighborhoods in the FHA single family mortgage insurance program. The FHA was created to build the suburbs of America and all of its policies, underwriting standards, appraisal standards were built from and geared to newly constructed suburban homes. The agency apparently interpreted its mandate to now produce specific target volumes of inner city loans as a directive to abandon its underwriting and appraisal and produce as many inner city loans as possible to mostly Black first-time homeowners. Block by block unscrupulous mortgage originators scared the homeowners in these one and multi-family homes into selling below market for fear their homes would be worth nothing at all as the blacks moved in. These same blockbusting brokers then resold these homes at greatly inflated prices to first-time black homeowners who believed their American dream had come true. The brokers provided fraudulent documentation on the loans which were all beyond the ability of the new homeowners to pay given their modest incomes. The neighborhood went from mostly white Jewish and Italian homeowners to overwhelmingly Black & Latino. Soon afterward some of the new homeowners were behind on mortgage payments and losing their homes to foreclosure. When the Brooklyn Office of City Planning began its court- mandated EIS East New York was a wasteland, row after row of vacant homes in poor condition and a central 4 or 6 block area of vacant land where houses had once stood. The court directive to prepare the EIS on East New York required recommendations as well as findings. The recommendations were then expanded into a Master Plan For East New York which included the entire Community Planning Board. Simultaneously the Brooklyn office developed a more specific plan for the rehabilitation and resale of the FHA foreclosure to qualified low income buyers. The plan was to rehabilitate these homes through non-profit community sponsors and resell them at affordable prices to pre-qualified low income homeowners. The program was called SHIP (Small Home Improvement Program). A $1 million loan pool commitment was secured from the East New York Savings Bank for the SHIP program. The program was then turned over to the City's Housing agency for implementation and administration. The SHIP program was modeled on a program developed the Sunset Park Redevelopment Committee then operating in Sunset Park with funding from the Ford Foundation. The Ford Foundation was also funding other pioneering innovative housing programs, including in nearby Bedford-Stuyvesant through the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation. SHIP was the first effort at low income home ownership by the City of New York and ran into some initial difficulties due to limitations in the State constitution on \\"gifts and loans\\" (the discounted sales price to new homeowners was considered \\"a gift\\"). At least the first 100 houses were eventually renovated under the program before it was abandoned. New subsidized single-family homes being built under the Nehemiah program. Later, most of these 1000 FHA foreclosed were torn down and replaced with new construction and much later some privately financed infill housing. Also, many subsidized multi-unit townhouses and newly constructed apartment buildings have been or are being built on vacant lots across the neighborhood. A significant number of these properties, many multi-family buildings, have fallen into disrepair and are at risk of landlord abandonment. In the 1980s East Brooklyn Congregations (EBC), an affiliate of the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) organized to address the need for quality affordable housing in East New York. This coalition advocated that vacant New York City owned land be provided at no cost for the development of new affordable owner occupied housing with subsidies for low-interest mortgages. This effort was called the Nehemiah Program. It was replicated in other parts of the city and country and led to national legislation. The Nehemiah homes were funded by a loan from $8 million loan fund from three Brooklyn Churches. Its setup was described as follows by The New York Times the city provides vacant sites, forgives real-estate taxes on the homes (but not the land) for 10 years, and provides what amounts to a $10,000 interest-free loan per house. Buyers pay $43,500 (their median income was $27,000; 40 percent moved from public or subsidized housing).\\" New developments are rising in the area, including the Gateway Center shopping mall located on what was once part of a landfill near Jamaica Bay.

This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 27% are between the ages of 0‚Äì17, 28% between 25‚Äì44, and 34% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 12% respectively. As of 2016, the median household income in Community Board 5 was $36,786. In 2018, an estimated 30% of East New York residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. One in ten residents (10%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 52% in East New York, higher than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , East New York is considered to be low-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. During the 1960s, East New York transitioned from being predominately Jewish and Italian to being predominately African American and Puerto Rican. However, now East New York is more diversified, with large African American, Puerto Rican, Dominican, West Indian, and South Asian populations.Brooklyn Community District 5 Due to gentrification of other Brooklyn neighborhoods, closer to Downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan, such as Bushwick and Bed-Stuy, East New York now has one of the fastest growing Black, Latino, and Asian populations in the city. Geography East New York covers a relatively large area, abutting the Queens border to the north and east. North of East New York is Highland Park, the Cemetery Belt, and the neighborhoods of Ridgewood and Glendale in Queens. The neighborhoods of Bushwick and Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant are northwest of East New York, while Brownsville is to the west and Canarsie is to the southwest. Jamaica Bay and the Shirley Chisholm State Park are located on the southern shore, while Woodhaven, Ozone Park, and Howard Beach in Queens are located to the east.Boundaries of East New York Land use East New York consists of mixed properties but primarily semi-detached homes, two-to-four family houses, and multi-unit apartment buildings, including condominiums and co-ops. The total land area is one square mile. The area is also home to the East Brooklyn Industrial Park. The 44-block industrial park was established in 1980 by the New York City Public Development Corporation in East New York's northwest quadrant. It is bounded by Atlantic Avenue, Sheffield Avenue, Sutter Avenue and Powell Street. Public housing developments of various type and a smaller number of tenements populate the area. There are eleven New York City Housing Authority developments located in East New York. * Boulevard Houses was the first of 11 developments to be built in the area. Built in 1950, it includes eighteen buildings, 6 and 14 stories tall. * Cypress Hills Houses; fifteen 7-story buildings. * East New York City Line; thirty-three 3-story buildings. * Fiorentino Plaza; eight 4-story buildings. * Linden Houses; nineteen buildings, 8 and 14 stories. * Long Island Baptist Houses; four, 6-story rehabilitated tenement buildings. * Pennsylvania Avenue-Wortman Avenue; three buildings, 8 and 16 stories tall. * Louis Heaton Pink Houses; twenty-two 8-story buildings. * Unity Plaza (Sites 4, 5A, 6, 7, 11, 12, 27); five 6-story buildings. * Unity Plaza (Sites 17, 24, 25A); three buildings 6 stories tall. * Vandalia Avenue; two 10-story buildings. With the founding of East New York Farms in 1998, there has been an increase usage in lots. Various organizations and local community groups have different gardens in order to beautify the area. African Burial Ground Square was designated in 2013 after remains were found some years earlier between New Lots and Livonia Avenues from Barbey to Schenck Streets. It shares space with the New Lots branch of the Brooklyn Public Library.\\"Citywide African Burial Grounds Gain Recognition,\\" Our Time Press, October 31 ‚Äì November 6, 2013, p.10. After months of effort the burial ground was finally confirmed and formally recognized. Subsections City Line Liberty Avenue in City Line City Line is a sub-section of East New York bordering the neighborhoods of Cypress Hills to the north and southwest and Ozone Park (Queens) to the east. The neighborhood is named \\"City Line\\" for its location in the former City of Brooklyn near the border with Queens County before Brooklyn and parts of Queens County were consolidated into New York City in 1898. Many Italians, Germans and Irish originally lived in the area, which today is home to immigrants from Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, and Puerto Rico. The neighborhood also includes African- Americans and Latino-Americans, and a scattered presence of South Asian- Americans. The main commercial district is located along Liberty Avenue. City Line is home to many restaurants, shopping stores, and food markets. New Lots New Lots Community Church New Lots is a sub-section of East New York. The \\"New Lots\\" east of the Town of Flatbush were laid out in the 18th century and were considered to be an eastward extension of Flatbush. The area was the site of the Town Hall of New Lots (located at 109-111 Bradford Street) from 1852 when the area seceded from Flatbush until it was annexed in 1886 as the 26th Ward of Brooklyn. The population is largely African-American and Latino- American. IS 218, PS 72 and Invictus Preparatory Charter School are right across from the public houses.Brooklyn Genealogy New Lots in 1890s Spring Creek Spring Creek is the southeastern part of the former Town of New Lots, and is often included in East New York. Its boundaries moving clockwise are: Linden Boulevard to the north; Betts Creek and Fountain Avenue to the east; Gateway National Recreation Area to the south; and Schenck Avenue and Hendrix Creek to the west. Some locations north of this area up to Linden Boulevard are also considered part of the neighborhood. Spring Creek includes the Starrett City apartment complex, the Gateway Mall, the Spring Creek Gardens gated housing development, and the Nehemiah Spring Creek and Gateway Elton affordable housing developments. Cypress Hills Rowhouses in Cypress Hills Cypress Hills, a subsection of East New York, is bordered on the south by City Line; to the north by Cypress Hills Cemetery; to the west by Bushwick; and to the east Woodhaven and Ozone Park in Queens. Cypress Hills is bordered by Highland Park Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue on the north, Eldert Lane on the east, Atlantic Avenue on the south, and Pennsylvania Ave on the west. The Arlington branch of the Brooklyn Public Library serves this community. (Despite the name, the Cypress Hills housing projects is not located within Cypress Hills.) This neighborhood is demographically mixed with Latino-Americans, South Asian-Americans, Caribbean Americans, Caucasians and African Americans. Area schools include: * Franklin K.

According to the Urdu scholar Habib R. Sulemani: \\"Roman Urdu is strongly opposed by the traditional Arabic script lovers. Despite this opposition it is still used by most on the internet and computers due to limitations of most technologies as they do not have the Urdu script. Although, this script is under development and thus the net users are using the Roman script in their own ways. Popular websites like Jang Group have devised their own schemes for Roman Urdu. This is of great advantage for those who are not able to read the Arabic script. MSN, Yahoo and some desi-chat- rooms are working as laboratories for the evolving new script and language (Roman Urdu).\\"The News International, September 8, 2003, Roman Urdu is often used by multinational corporations like Unilever or Pepsi to save money and resources on printing and advertising while marketing their products in both India and Pakistan. The method of writing is would correct understand with the new chart. Although the idea of romanising Urdu had been suggested several times, it was General Ayub Khan who most seriously suggested adopting the Latin alphabet for Urdu and all Pakistani languages during his rule of the country.Paving new paths to romanise Urdu script, Mushir Anwar, Dawn (newspaper), Nov 27, 2008The Urdu-English Controversy in Pakistan, Tariq Rahman, Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 31, No. 1 (Feb., 1997), pp. 177-207The Language Movement: An Outline , Rafiqul Islam The suggestion was inspired to an extent by Atat√ºrk's adoption of the Latin alphabet for Turkish in Turkey. In India, where the Devanagari script is used, Roman Urdu was widely used in the Indian Army, as well as in Christian mission schools, especially for translations of the Bible. The Hunterian transliteration system mostly avoids diacritics and non-standard characters.

Pakistani and Indian Christians often used the Roman script for writing Urdu. The Bible Society of India publishes Roman Urdu Bibles, which enjoyed sale late into the 1960s (though they are still published today). Church songbooks are also common in Roman Urdu. However, its usage in Christian contexts is declining in India with the wider use of Hindi and English in the states. Bollywood, India's major film industry, uses a version of Roman script as the main script for its film titles. This is because Bollywood films have an appeal for viewers across South Asia and even in the Middle East. The DevanƒÅgarƒ´ script is used mostly by Hindi speakers while the Perso-Arabic script is used primarily by Urdu speakers. The language used in Bollywood films is often called Hindi, but most dialogues are actually written in Hindustani‚Äîthey can be understood by Urdu and Hindi speakers alike. Because the film industry wants to reach the largest possible audience, just using the DevanƒÅgarƒ´ or Perso-Arabic script would be unfavorable for the Bollywood industry as few individuals are literate in both scripts. For this reason, the neutral Roman script is used for Bollywood film titles, though some films include the Hindi and Urdu scripts as well. The similar circumstances are also applied with Pakistan's Lollywood filming industry, where, along with the Urdu name or title of the movie, a Roman Urdu title is always provided for viewers. Roman Urdu used on Internet is non standard and has very irregular spellings. Users who use Roman Urdu on Internet try to imitate English orthography. In most cases they are unaware of the fact that English spellings are not often phonetic. There are several Romanization standards for writing Urdu among them the most prominent are Uddin and Begum Urdu-Hindustani Romanization, ALA-LC romanization and ArabTeX. There are two main problems with Roman Urdu schemes which exists. Either they are not reversible to Urdu script or they don't allow pronouncing the Urdu words properly. Another shortcoming is that a lot of Roman Urdu schemes confuse the Urdu letter 'Choti He' which has the sound of voiceless glottal fricative with 'Do Chasham He' which is used as a digraph for aspirated consonants in Urdu script. The digraphs \\"Sh\\" for letter Shin and \\"Zh\\" for letter Zhe also cause problems as they could be interpreted as the letter Sin and 'Choti He' or letter Ze and 'Choti He' respectively. Most Roman Urdu schemes also do not take much consideration of Urdu orthography and the spelling system. Criticism In Pakistan Roman Urdu is promoted by the Liberal, Secular and Westernized sections of the society as an alternate to the Perso-Arabic Script which Urdu uses. In contrast, the adoption of Roman Urdu has stiff opposition from the Conservative classes which see Perso-Arabic Script as the heritage of Indo-Islamic Civilization which Pakistan inherited from the Mughal and other past Islamic empires.  Informal Roman Urdu  The system of Romanisation used most often by native speakers differs from the formal systems presented in most English language sources. It contains no diacritics or special characters, usually just the 26 letters of the core English alphabet. Informal Romanised Urdu is mutually intelligible with Romanised Hindi and the distinction between the languages can be controversial. While the Urdu alphabet is derived from the Arabic alphabet informal Romanised Urdu is less eccentric than informal Romanised Arabic. Informal Romanised Urdu does not use numerals, and rarely uses mixed case, because the Arabic letters that lack a clear equivalent in the English Latin alphabet (e.g. ) are often silent in Urdu or pronounced identically to other letters (e.g. ). So, this system of Urdu Romanisation is used in some slightly more formal contexts than informal Romanised Arabic. One example is the word \\"aurat\\". Formal transliterations often include a punctuation mark (') or special character () for the ayn but this is omitted by Urdu speakers such as in the context of the annual International Women's Day. Adding the special characters makes it harder to type and would cause things such as twitter hashtags to break. The discussion on social media about these events is often in informal Romanised Urdu, with frequent code switching between Urdu and English, but the handwritten or expertly typeset signs at the events are mostly in either English, Urdu in the traditional script, or local languages.

He was shot dead by his landlord and neighbour, ex-policeman George Stagg, thus becoming the first and to-date only active Football League player in England to have been murdered. Football career Ball was born in Chester-le-Street, County Durham in North-east England, and was brought up in nearby Usworth. He played football for his school, winning a medal as a ten-year-old. After school he worked as a coalminer, playing for various colliery teams, before being signed by Newcastle United. He made no first-team appearances for Newcastle before moving to the West Midlands to join Aston Villa of the Football League First Division in January 1920, where he was seen as cover for Frank Barson. His first-team appearances were limited until Barson left Villa in August 1922 after which Ball became the first-choice centre-half, making 36 appearances in the 1922‚Äì23 season, at the end of which Villa finished sixth in the league table. In the following season, he continued to perform well at the heart of Villa's defence and he was forecast to be called up to play for England. His last game for Villa came on 10 November 1923 with a 1‚Äì0 victory at Notts County's Meadow Lane ground; this result left Villa third in the league table. By this time, Ball had made a total of 77 appearances in league and cup matches. Personal life and death In May 1922, Ball married Beatrice Richards, the daughter of a local pork butcher and pie maker. In October, the couple moved into Somerville Cottages, on Brick Kiln Lane, Perry Barr which they rented from George Stagg, who occupied the adjoining cottage. Stagg was a former-policeman who had been injured during the First World War; after the war, he had taken various factory jobs before purchasing the Brick Kiln Lane properties in 1921. The relationship between Stagg and Ball was strained, with Stagg objecting to Ball's chickens straying into his garden; Stagg had threatened to poison the chickens and had made attempts to have Ball evicted from the cottage. On the evening of Sunday 11 November, the day after the match at Nottingham, Ball and his wife had visited the Church Tavern where Ball drunk 3¬Ω pints of ale. They returned home late in the evening and, shortly after 10 pm Ball had gone into his garden to fetch his dog. Mrs. Ball heard an argument in the garden followed by a gunshot. She ran out into the garden where she saw her husband \\"in a very distressed state, reeling towards her\\". Mrs. Ball claimed that Stagg shot again with the bullet passing over her shoulder. Ball died shortly afterwards from the gunshot wounds. Stagg made no attempt to flee and was arrested by the police at the scene. His funeral was held on 19 November, and has been described as \\"a grand occasion\\". The funeral cortege set off from the butcher's shop of Beatrice Ball's father, William Richards, in High Street, Aston; seven coaches and several cars made their way through the crowds lining the streets to the packed St. John's Church, Perry Barr where the coffin was carried by Ball's former teammates. There were floral tributes from local football clubs, as well as from Middlesbrough, close to his birthplace. A collection among the crowd at Aston Villa's home match on the Saturday before the funeral raised over a hundred pounds for Ball's widow. Ball was buried in St. John's churchyard in an ornate grave decorated with footballs. The grave bears the inscription: \\"To T.E. Ball ‚Äì A token of esteem from his fellow players of Aston Villa F.C.\\" Over the years, the grave became rather neglected but has now been restored by Villa supporters led by Jeff Hilliar. The following poem was written shortly after Ball's murder: > Twas on a Sabbath evening in drear November days > Two friends were heard creating, in Perry Barry's byways > High words just fed the anger, now this young man's life is fled. > A shot and then another! And Thomas Ball lies dead. Murder trial At the coroner's inquest into Ball's death, Stagg admitted the killing but claimed it had been an accident. He claimed that he had fired the gun in order to frighten Ball and that Ball was shot as he attempted to grab the gun. The jury rejected this argument, returning a verdict of \\"wilful murder\\", and Stagg was committed for trial at Stafford Assizes. The murder trial was heard in February 1924 in front of Mr. Justice Rowlatt. Stagg continued to claim that the killing was an accident and that he first fired the gun when Ball (allegedly \\"under the influence of drink\\") started to climb over the gate following an argument. There then followed a fight where Ball tried to wrench the gun away from Stagg; as Stagg fell back, the gun discharged accidentally, killing Ball. Stagg also claimed that Ball had threatened to attack Mrs. Stagg who was watching from a first-floor window: \\"I will come up and dash your brains out\\" and that Beatrice Ball had later said \\"He would not have hurt Mrs. Stagg, although he kicks me about\\". This was refuted at the trial by Mrs. Ball who \\"emphatically denied\\" that her husband had ever hit her. The Aston Villa trainer, Alf Miles, was called as a witness saying that Ball was a \\"good living man ‚Äì always in the best of condition\\". In his summing up, Mr. Justice Rowlatt instructed the jury not to show too much sympathy towards Stagg, but \\"to look at the facts dispassionately\\". Although there was a conflict of evidence as to how Ball was killed and although there might have been no motive, \\"it might still be murder if a man might lose his temper against a person he did not like and commit an act of murder\\". If the gun was pointed at the victim and discharged on purpose, that was murder, whereas if it went off by accident during a struggle, that was manslaughter. After deliberating for an hour and forty minutes, the jury returned a verdict of \\"wilful murder\\" with a recommendation of mercy. Despite this, Mr. Justice Rowlatt passed a sentence of death. Stagg was refused leave to appeal, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment as part of the reforms introduced by the newly elected Labour Government. Stagg was subsequently declared \\"insane\\" and was incarcerated in Broadmoor Hospital. He eventually died in a Birmingham mental hospital in February 1966, aged 87.

It was released in April 1999 as the lead single from the group's third studio album, Enema of the State (1999), and appears as the fifth track. The song, written primarily by bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, lyrically revolves around the onset of age and maturity, and the failure to implement changes in behavior. A mid-tempo pop punk song, it was written by Hoppus based on personal experience. It was originally titled \\"Peter Pan Complex\\", an allusion to the pop-psychology concept, but MCA Records forced the band to retitle the song, as the label found it too obscure of a reference. It was the first Blink-182 single to feature drummer Travis Barker. It became Blink-182‚Äôs second hit single, peaking at number two on Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart for ten weeks. The song hit number three in Italy and number 17 in the United Kingdom. Primarily an airplay hit, the song was the band's first to cross over to pop radio, hitting number 58 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song's signature music video famously features the band running nude on the streets of Los Angeles. It received heavy rotation on MTV and other music video channels. As a result of this exposure, it gave the band an unwanted reputation for nudity, which would lead them to take more creative control of the group's image later in its career. The song received positive reviews and has been called a classic pop punk track; NME placed it at number 117 on its list \\"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\\" in 2012. Production and composition Bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus composed the song based on personal experience. \\"What's My Age Again?\\" was written by bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, though it was credited to both him and guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge. Hoppus began creating the song primarily as a joke to amuse friends. The song was more vulgar in earlier incarnations. Hoppus composed the opening riff by trying and failing to play the opening bass riff of the song \\"J.A.R.\\" by Green Day on guitar. The track originally was titled \\"Peter Pan Complex\\" and went through a large number of changes before it was finally completed. The label felt people wouldn't understand the reference and the band felt acrimonious after renaming it. According to Hoppus, a few lines near the end of the song were written the day the final cut of the song was completed. Band management and label executives saw a strong single in \\"What's My Age Again?\\" although DeLonge felt otherwise: \\"I didn't understand it, because up to that point, we hadn't had a big single.\\" \\"What's My Age Again?\\" was written by Hoppus and DeLonge, sung by Hoppus and produced by Jerry Finn.Enema of the State liner notes. MCA Records (1999) The song is two minutes and twenty-eight seconds long. The song is composed in the key of F-sharp major and is set in time signature of common time with a driving tempo of 158 beats per minute. Hoppus' vocal range spans from C3 to F4. The song has lyrics which Hoppus describe as autobiographical \\"about being in my 20s and acting like a jackass teenager.\\" The narrator describes various immature experiences, such as turning on the television as he receives fellatio from his female companion, and later making a prank call to her mother. The opening bass line is similar to that from the Pixies' \\"Debaser\\". Critical reception Billboard deemed the song a \\"peppy punk anthem,\\" and Spin called it an \\"ideal tonic for back-to-school nausea.\\" Kerrang! called the song \\"ridiculously infectious.\\" In the United Kingdom, critics were less on board: the New Musical Express (NME) derided the song as \\"more mindless, punk-pop guitar thrashing from the world's current favorite American brats [...] on the plus side, the song ‚Äî much like Blink-182's career, we hope ‚Äî only lasts for two-and-a-half minutes.\\" Later reviews have subsequently been positive. Jon Blisten of Beats Per Minute deemed it one of the record's \\"finest songs,\\" calling it a \\"twisted, self-depreciating examination of man-children.\\" In 2014, Billboard called it \\"the quintessential Blink manifesto ‚Äî the story of a twenty-something who still acts like a child.\\" Consequence of Sound, in a 2015 top 10 of the band's best songs, ranked it as number six, commenting, \\"The truth is that it was always a little strange for grown men to be writing songs about prom night and other high- school pitfalls, but \\"What‚Äôs My Age Again?\\" works so well because it tackles that strangeness head-on.\\" Chart performance Commercially, \\"What's My Age Again?\\" became one of the band's best-performing singles. The song was first issued to radio in April 1999, premiering on Los Angeles-based radio station KROQ coincidentally when the band were mixing the final recorded song on the album, \\"The Party Song\\". The song gathered mass airplay over the course of the summer of 1999. The song did best on Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart; the song first entered the chart during the week of May 8, where it debuted at number 21. It first hit the top five during the week of June 5, and hit number two on July 24, where it remained for ten weeks behind the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \\"Scar Tissue\\". The song crossed over to mainstream radio during the summer, where it debuted at number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100 on July 17. It later peaked at number 58 in the issue dated October 23. The song had previously peaked at number 51 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart on September 11. The song charted within the top 20 in the United Kingdom, peaking highest at number 17 on the UK Singles Chart. Clips of the single, as well as 30-second excerpts from album tracks \\"Aliens Exist\\" and \\"Going Away to College\\", were available online via the early digital distributor a2b Music in the weeks preceding the album's release. Music video 3rd Street in Los Angeles. The music video for \\"What's My Age Again?\\", directed by Marcos Siega, features the band running in the nude through the streets of Los Angeles, as well as through commercials and daily news programs. The trio only slow down when they spot porn star Janine Lindemulder (the model featured on the cover of Enema of the State). The trio wore flesh-colored Speedos for most of the scenes. \\"Watching people's faces in the cars as they drove past us was the best,\\" Hoppus told Rolling Stone. \\"They almost got into accidents. They just saw these ugly blobs running down the street.\\" Siega had known the band for many years at that point, having seen them play small clubs years before. He got the idea from watching a late-night talk show segment about a streaker. Hoppus and DeLonge were immediately receptive to the idea; Barker less so. \\"My brain kept going to the sort of anti-establishment punk rock ethic that I associated them with. But not in an aggro way. They always came across to me as doing it with a wink,\\" Siega later recalled. The video first began receiving airplay in early May, debuting on MTV, MTV2 and The Box. The video was MTV's second-most played video for the week ending August 1, and remained a popular video on the channel for over two years. The video was nominated for Best Alternative Video at the 2000 MVPA Awards, but lost to Foo Fighters' \\"Learn to Fly\\". The band referenced the clip at the 1999 Billboard Awards, which opened with a clip of the band streaking through Las Vegas. The trio also appeared on Total Request Live (TRL) and Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place in the nude as well. The video gave the band a reputation for nudity that plagued the group's career, leading many critics to pigeonhole them as a joke act. \\"It became something of an albatross as band members grew up,\\" wrote Richard Harrington of The Washington Post. \\"You know, when we were filming the video for \\"What's My Age Again?\\" the whole naked thing was only funny for like 10 minutes. Then, I was the guy standing naked on the side of the street Los Angeles with cars driving by me giving me the finger and shit. It‚Äôs funny watching the video now, but at the time, it stopped being funny ten minutes in, and it definitely wasn‚Äôt funny three days into it,\\" recalled Tom DeLonge. Siega, the video's director, in 2014. This reputation would lead the band members to take control of their marketing and image, as DeLonge later commented in 2014: The banana man who appeared in the video later re-appeared in the band's next video for \\"All the Small Things\\", which is the second single from Enema of The State. The music video for the band's 2016 single \\"She's Out of Her Mind\\" pays homage to the video for \\"What's My Age Again?\\" with social media personalities running in the nude in Los Angeles. Lindemulder's place in the video was taken by actor and comedian Adam DeVine. Legacy By the late 2000s, club promoters in the United Kingdom created nights based around lasting appreciation of the pop punk genre, including one named after \\"What's My Age Again?\\", described as a night celebrating \\"pop-punk, youthful abandon and teenage riot\\". Rolling Stone Nicole Frehs√©e wrote that, \\"For a new generation of emo fans and bands, Blink's irreverent, upbeat take on punk rock with hits like \\"What's My Age Again?\\" and \\"All the Small Things\\" was hugely influential.\\" The Hollywood Reporter Mischa Pearlman, in a review a 2013 concert by the group, wrote that the song \\"visibly infects every member of the audience. Because it's a song that recalls the reckless abandon of youth, and the carelessness of growing up.\\" Although the magazine gave the song a scathing review upon its initial release, NME placed it at number 117 on its list \\"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\\" nearly thirteen years later, writing, \\"Few songs capture the urge of wanting to act stupid and be immature as well as this 2000 single does. [...] This is everything pop punk does well. Its guitar riffs seem to have been soaked in Relentless and its chorus makes you want to jump around the room. It's been imitated thousands of times since, but nothing's come close to this...\\" British radio station BBC Radio 1 have a section on one of their shows named after the single and using it as the theme song. Greg James originated the game on his drivetime show, and has moved it to The BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show. The game sees Greg pitted against an opponent, typically a fellow Radio 1 DJ/presenter or celebrity guest. In the game, three listeners phone in and talk to the competitors, who take it in turns to ask questions, then try to guess the listeners' age. Mashup In May 2019, the band recorded a live mashup of the song with hip hop artist Lil Wayne, to promote their joint headlining tour. The track combines \\"What's My Age Again? and Wayne's 2008 single \\"A Milli\\". The duo later released a joint digital single featuring a studio version of the mashup in August of that year. The track features Matt Skiba, who replaced founding guitarist Tom DeLonge in 2015, performing backing vocals and guitar. A press release promoted the new version, which was released to promote the second leg of the aforementioned tour, as a \\"new take on the track.\\" The Fader contributor Jordan Darville noted that Wayne altered a lyric from his original verse, substituting the term \\"crackers\\" for \\"bitches\\".

Filippo Pacini (25 May 1812 ‚Äì 9 July 1883) was an Italian anatomist, posthumously famous for isolating the cholera bacterium Vibrio cholerae in 1854, well before Robert Koch's more widely accepted discoveries 30 years later.Fillipo Pacini (1854) \\"Osservazioni microscopiche e deduzioni patologiche sul cholera asiatico\\" (Microscopic observations and pathological deductions on Asiatic cholera), Gazzetta Medica Italiana: Toscana, 2nd series, 4(50) : 397-401; 4(51): 405-412. Reprinted (more legibily) as a pamphlet. Pacini was born in Pistoia, Tuscany, to Francesco, a humble cobbler, and Umilta' Dolfi, but was given a religious education in hopes that he would become a bishop. However, in 1830, he was given a scholarship to the most venerable medical school in Pistoia. He learned his job as a doctor and how to examine and dissect dead bodies under a microscope. In 1831, during a dissection class, Pacini discovered small sensory organs in the nervous system which can detect pressure and vibrations. He studied them closely from 1833 on, and first discussed them in 1835 at the Societ√† medico-fisica in Florence, but did not publish his research (\\"Nuovi organi scoperti nel corpo umano\\") until 1840. Within just a few years, the work was widely known in Europe and the bodies had become known as Pacinian corpuscles. He served as an assistant to Paolo Savi in Pisa from 1840 to 1843, then began working at the Institute of Human Anatomy. He was professor of anatomy at the University of Pisa from 1844 to 1846. In 1847, Pacini began teaching at the Lyceum in Florence, and then was named chair of General and Topographic Anatomy at the \\"Istituto di Studi Superiori\\" at the University of Florence in 1849, where he remained to the end of his career. The Asiatic cholera pandemic of 1846-63 was the time period when Pacini made his discovery of the cholera bacillus. Cholera came to Florence in 1854 during the Asiatic Cholera Pandemic of 1846-63. Pacini became very interested in the disease. Immediately following the death of cholera patients, he performed an autopsy and with his microscope, conducted histological examinations of the intestinal mucosa. During such studies, Pacini discovered a comma-shaped bacillus which he described as a Vibrio. He published a paper in 1854 entitled, \\"Microscopical observations and pathological deductions on cholera\\" in which he described the organism and its relation to the disease. His microscopic slides of the organism were clearly labeled, identifying the date and nature of his investigations (see figure). But because of the prevailing belief of Italian scientists in the miasma theory of disease, the work was not noted by others until many years after his death, despite additional publications in 1865, 1866, 1871, 1876, and 1880 which identified the cause of the disease's lethality, and even proposed some effective treatments. John Snow, who disproved the miasma theory, and Robert Koch, were widely and erroneously credited with the discovery of the bacillum 30 years later. Pacini's work was repeatedly published and readily available to the international scientific community via the English translation published in The British and Foreign Medico-chirurgical Review, Volume 38, July 1866.British and Foreign Medico- chirurgical Review, Volume 38, July 1866 https://books.google.com/books?id=PXw6AQAAMAAJ&pg;=PA167 Also in 1854, the Catalan Joaquim Balcells i Pascual discovered the cholera bacterium. When Koch, a much more widely respected scientist who had previously identified the tuberculosis bacillus, presented his findings to the Cholera Commission of the Imperial Health Office in Berlin in 1884, the commission congratulated him, but also recognized Pacini's previous discovery of the bacterium.UCLA: Who first discovered cholera? In 1965, the international committee on nomenclature adopted the formal name Vibrio cholera pacini Pacini 1854 to honor his work.Who Named It: Filippo Pacini During his career, Pacini also published several studies on the retina of the human eye, the electric organs in electric fishes, the structure of bone, and the mechanics of respiration. Pacini did not marry, and spent most of the money remaining after his scientific investigations on the long-term care of his two ailing sisters, Assunta and Maria Giustina. He died nearly penniless in Florence on July 9, 1883, and was buried in the cemetery of the Misericordia. In 1935, his remains were transferred to the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, along with the remains of Atto Tigri and Filippo Civinini, two other noted anatomists.

African philosophers may be found in the various academic fields of philosophy, such as metaphysics, epistemology, moral philosophy, and political philosophy. One particular subject that many African philosophers have written about is that on the subject of freedom and what it means to be free or to experience wholeness. Philosophy in Africa has a rich and varied history, some of which has been lost over time. One of the earliest known African philosophers was Ptahhotep, an ancient Egyptian philosopher. In the early and mid-twentieth century, anti-colonial movements had a tremendous effect on the development of a distinct African political philosophy that had resonance on both the continent and in the African diaspora. One well-known example of the economic philosophical works emerging from this period was the African socialist philosophy of Ujamaa propounded in Tanzania and other parts of Southeast Africa. These African political and economic philosophical developments also had a notable impact on the anti-colonial movements of many non-African peoples around the world. Definition There is some debate in defining the ethnophilosophical parameters of African philosophy and identifying what differentiates it from other philosophical traditions. One of the implicit assumptions of ethnophilosophy is that a specific culture can have a philosophy that is not applicable and accessible to all peoples and cultures in the world. In A Discourse on African Philosophy: A New Perspective on Ubuntu and Transitional Justice in South Africa, Christian B. N. Gade argues that the ethnophilosophical approach to African philosophy as a static group property is highly problematic. His research on ubuntu presents an alternative collective discourse on African philosophy that takes differences, historical developments, and social contexts seriously. According to Edwin Etieyibo and Jonathon O. Chimakonam in their article ‚ÄúAfrican Philosophy: Past, Present, and Future‚Äù, historical context plays an important role in African philosophy. History provides the framework in which we can inspect philosophical problems. In terms of African philosophy, one must look at the whole picture through the lens of African history. ‚ÄúThere are no facts without history.\\" African philosophy can be formally defined as a critical thinking by Africans on their experiences of reality. Nigerian born Philosopher K.C. Anyanwu defined African philosophy as \\"that which concerns itself with the way in which African people of the past and present make sense of their destiny and of the world in which they live. Nigerian philosopher Joseph I. Omoregbe broadly defines a philosopher as one who attempts to understand the world's phenomena, the purpose of human existence, the nature of the world, and the place of human beings in that world. This form of natural philosophy is identifiable in Africa even before individual African philosophers can be distinguished in the sources.Maurice Muhatia Makumba, An Introduction to African Philosophy: Past and Present (2007), p. 25. Like Western philosophy, African philosophy contemplates the perceptions of time, personhood, space and other subjects.  History  African philosophy's beginning is linked to the 1920s. African individuals who had studied in the United States and Europe (\\"Western\\" locations) had returned to Africa and reflected on the racial discrimination experienced abroad. Their arrival back in Africa instigated a feeling of onuma, which is an interpretation of \\"frustration.\\" The onuma was felt in response to legacies of colonialism on a global scale. The beginning of African philosophy is important because onuma inspired some who had traveled and returned to formulate a \\"systematic beginning\\" of philosophizing the African identity, the space of African people in history, and African contribution to humanity.  Criteria  Two conflicting components are deemed integral to a work for it to be considered African philosophy. First, the piece must have a racial focus. This facet is valued by Traditionalist groups, who posit that African philosophy should be an expression of the world experienced by African individuals. African philosophy must be produced by African authors. In contrast, Universalist groups suggest that African philosophy should be analyses and critical engagement of and between individual African thinkers. A work is African philosophy based on a focal point of tradition. African philosophy must pull from African cultural backgrounds or thought processes, but it should be independent from racial considerations and use \\"African\\" only as a term of solidarity.  Methods   Communitarian Method  The communitarian method of African philosophy emphasizes mutualism in thought. It is most commonly used by researchers following ubuntu. The common expression of ubuntu is that \\"a person is a person through a person.\\" Leonhard Praeg, Mogobe Ramose, and Fainos Mangera implement the communitarian method.  Complementary Method  The complementary method focuses on the prospect of a missing link. All variables are important in consideration of histories and identities, and no variable should be overlooked or under-considered. Additionally, all variables affect one another, so the relationship between them and their affects on other variables should be scrutinized. Mesembe Edet implements the complementary method.  Conversational Method  The conversational method creates thought by assessing a relationship between oppositional works. The defender or proponent is named \\"nwa-swa,\\" and the nwa swa is questioned and doubted by a disagreeing party, known as \\"nwa nju.\\" The conversational method emphasizes the interconnectedness of networks within reality; the more accurate a thought should be, the more specific a location should be. This method is endorsed by the Conventional School of Psychology, and it is used by Victor Nweke and Msembe Edet. Types Pre-modern North Africa In North Africa, arguably central to the development of the ancient Egyptian philosophical tradition of Egypt and Sudan was the conception of \\"ma'at\\", which roughly translated refers to \\"justice\\", \\"truth\\", or simply \\"that which is right\\". One of the earliest works of political philosophy was The Maxims of Ptahhotep, which were taught to Egyptian schoolboys for centuries. Ancient Egypt have several philosophical texts that have been treated by scholars in recent years. In the 2018 podcast \\"Africana Philosophy\\", the philosophers Peter Adamson and Chike Jeffers devoted the first eight episodes to Egyptian philosophy. The American Philosophical Association (APA) has published a text on the classical text \\"The Immortality of Writers\\" (\\"Be A Writer\\"), ca. 1200 BCE. The Blog of the APA article also covers ‚ÄúThe Dispute Between a Man and His Ba‚Äù of 19th century BCE; ‚ÄúThe Teaching of Ani‚Äù, 13th century BCE, which gives advice to the ordinary man; ‚ÄúThe Satire of the Trades‚Äù by Khety; and the text of Amennakht (active in 1170‚Äì1140 BCE) from Deir El-Medina, whose teaching states that ‚Äúit is good to finish school, better than the smell of lotus blossoms in summer.‚Äù Ancient Egyptian philosophers also made important contributions to Hellenistic philosophy and Christian philosophy. According to Busiris by the ancient Greek philosopher Isocrates, the senior of Plato, ‚Äúall men agree the Egyptians are the healthiest and most long of life among men; and then for the soul they introduced philosophy‚Äôs training‚Ä¶‚Äù Isocrates declared that Greek writers traveled to Egypt to seek knowledge; one of them Pythagoras of Samos who ‚Äúwas first to bring to the Greeks all philosophy.‚Äù In the Hellenistic tradition, the influential philosophical school of Neoplatonism was founded by the Egyptian philosopher Plotinus in the 3rd century CE. West Africa The most prominent of West Africa's pre-modern philosophical traditions has been identified as that of the Yoruba philosophical tradition and the distinctive worldview that emerged from it over the thousands of years of its development. Philosophical concepts such as Omoluabi, Ash√® and Emi Omo Eso were integral to this system, and the totality of its elements are contained in what is known amongst the Yoruba as the Itan. The cosmologies and philosophies of the Akan, Dogon, Serer and Dahomey were also significant. In pre-colonial Senegambia (modern Gambia and Senegal), the 17th-century philosopher Kocc Barma Fall stood out as one of the renowned philosophers in Senegambian history. His proverbs are still recited by Senegalese and Gambians alike, including in Senegambian popular culture - for example in Ousmane Sembene's films such as GuelwaarWare, Rudolph T., The Walking Qur ºan: Islamic Education, Embodied Knowledge, and History in West Africa, UNC Press Books (2014), p. 101, Murphy, David, Sembene: Imagining Alternatives in Film & Fiction. James Currey Publishers (200), p. 63, Other notable philosophical thinkers include the Gambian historian Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof, and the Malian ethnologist Amadou Hamp√¢t√© B√¢. Horn of Africa In the Horn of Africa, there are a number of sources documenting the development of a distinct Ethiopian philosophy from the first millennium onwards. Among the most notable examples from this tradition emerge from the work of the 17th-century philosopher Zera Yacob, and that of his disciple Walda Heywat. Yacob in his writings discusses religion, morality, and existence. He comes to the belief that every person will believe their faith to be the right one and that all men are created equal. Southern Africa In Southern Africa and Southeast Africa the development of a distinctive Bantu philosophy addressing the nature of existence, the cosmos and humankind's relation to the world following the Bantu migration has had the most significant impact on the philosophical developments of the said regions, with the development of the philosophy of Ubuntu as one notable example emerging from this worldview. Central Africa Many Central African philosophical traditions before the Bantu migration into southern Central Africa have been identified as a uniting characteristic of many Nilotic and Sudanic peoples, ultimately giving rise to the distinctive worldviews identified in the conceptions of time, the creation of the world, human nature, and the proper relationship between mankind and nature prevalent in Dinka mythology, Maasai mythology and similar traditions. African Diaspora Some pre-Modern African diasporic philosophical traditions have also been identified, mostly produced by descendants of Africans in Europe and the Americas. One notable pre-modern diasporic African philosopher was Anthony William Amo, who was taken as a slave from Awukenu in what is now Ghana, and was brought up and educated in Europe where he gained doctorates in medicine and philosophy, and subsequently became a professor of philosophy at the universities of Halle and Jena in Germany. Modern Kenyan philosopher Henry Odera Oruka has distinguished what he calls four trends in modern African philosophy: ethnophilosophy, philosophical sagacity, nationalistic-ideological philosophy, and professional philosophy.Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998), pp. 38-39, In fact it would be more realistic to call them candidates for the position of African philosophy, with the understanding that more than one of them might fit the bill. (Oruka later added two additional categories: literary/artistic philosophy, such as the work of literary figures such as Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, Okot p'Bitek, and Taban Lo Liyong, and hermeneutic philosophy, the analysis of African languages in order to find philosophical content.) In the African diaspora, American philosopher Maulana Karenga has also been notable in presenting varied definitions for understanding modern African philosophy, especially as it relates to its earliest sources. Achille Mbembe, a modern African philosopher One notable contributor to professional philosophy is Achille Mbembe. He interacts with a multitude of modern subjects, including thoughts on statehood, death, capital, racism, and colonialism. His invokes attention to moral and political arguments through a tone of morality in his works. Many recent pieces from Mbembe, including Critique of Black Reason, suggest that understanding Europe as a force not at the center of the universe is a point from which philosophy and society should view the world. Mbembe asserts that he positions himself in multiple worlds of existence at one time. This method creates an empathetic point from which the world can be viewed. Ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity Ethnophilosophy has been used to record the beliefs found in African cultures. Such an approach treats African philosophy as consisting in a set of shared beliefs, values, categories, and assumptions that are implicit in the language, practices, and beliefs of African cultures; in short, the uniquely African worldview. As such, it is seen as an item of communal property rather than an activity for the individual. One proponent of this form, Placide Tempels, argued in Bantu Philosophy that the metaphysical categories of the Bantu people are reflected in their linguistic categories. According to this view, African philosophy can be best understood as springing from the fundamental assumptions about reality reflected in the languages of Africa. Another example of this sort of approach is the work of Ebiegberi Joe Alagoa of the University of Port Harcourt in Nigeria, who argues for the existence of an African philosophy of history stemming from traditional proverbs from the Niger Delta in his paper \\"An African Philosophy of History in the Oral Tradition.\\" Alagoa argues that in African philosophy, age is seen as an important factor in gaining wisdom and interpreting the past. In support of this view, he cites proverbs such as \\"More days, more wisdom\\", and \\"What an old man sees seated, a youth does not see standing.\\" Truth is seen as eternal and unchanging (\\"Truth never rots\\"), but people are subject to error (\\"Even a four-legged horse stumbles and falls\\"). It is dangerous to judge by appearances (\\"A large eye does not mean keen vision\\"), but first-hand observation can be trusted (\\"He who sees does not err\\"). The past is not seen as fundamentally different from the present, but all history is contemporary history (\\"A storyteller does not tell of a different season\\"). The future remains beyond knowledge (\\"Even a bird with a long neck cannot see the future\\"). Nevertheless, it is said, \\"God will outlive eternity.\\" History is seen as vitally important (\\"One ignorant of his origin is nonhuman\\"), and historians (known as \\"sons of the soil\\") are highly revered (\\"The son of the soil has the python's keen eyes\\"). However, these arguments must be taken with a grain of cultural relativism, as the span of culture in Africa is incredibly vast, with patriarchies, matriarchies, monotheists and traditional religionists among the population, and as such the attitudes of groups of the Niger Delta cannot be applied to the whole of Africa. Another more controversial application of this approach is embodied in the concept of Negritude. Leopold Senghor, a proponent of Negritude, argued that the distinctly African approach to reality is based on emotion rather than logic, works itself out in participation rather than analysis, and manifests itself through the arts rather than the sciences. Cheikh Anta Diop and Mubabinge Bilolo, on the other hand, while agreeing that African culture is unique, challenged the view of Africans as essentially emotional and artistic, arguing that Egypt was an African culture whose achievements in science, mathematics, architecture, and philosophy were pre-eminent. This philosophy may also be maligned as overly reductionist due to the obvious scientific and scholarly triumphs of not only ancient Egypt, but also Nubia, Meroe, as well as the great library of Timbuktu, the extensive trade networks and kingdoms of North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, the Horn of Africa and Great Zimbabwe and the other major empires of Southern, Southeast and Central Africa. Critics of this approach argue that the actual philosophical work in producing a coherent philosophical position is being done by the academic philosopher (such as Alagoa), and that the sayings of the same culture can be selected from and organised in many different ways in order to produce very different, often contradictory systems of thought. Philosophical sagacity is a sort of individualist version of ethnophilosophy, in which one records the beliefs of certain special members of a community. The premise here is that, although most societies demand some degree of conformity of belief and behaviour from their members, a certain few of those members reach a particularly high level of knowledge and understanding of their cultures' worldviews; such people are sages. In some cases, the sage goes beyond mere knowledge and understanding to reflection and questioning--these become the targets of philosophical sagacity. Critics of this approach note that not all reflection and questioning is philosophical; besides, if African philosophy were to be defined purely in terms of philosophic sagacity, then the thoughts of the sages could not be African philosophy, for they did not record them from other sages. Also, on this view the only difference between non-African anthropology or ethnology and African philosophy seems to be the nationality of the researcher. Critics argue further that the problem with both ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity is that there is surely an important distinction between philosophy and the history of ideas, although other philosophers consider the two topics to be remarkably similar.\\"Overview African Philosophy\\", p. 172, One Hundred Philosophers, Peter J. King, Zebra, 2006 The argument is that no matter how interesting the beliefs of a people such as the Akan or the Yoruba may be to the philosopher, they remain beliefs, not philosophy. To call them philosophy is to use a secondary sense of that term, such as in \\"my philosophy is live and let live. Professional philosophy Professional philosophy is usually identified as that produced by African philosophers trained in the Western philosophical tradition, that embraces a universal view of the methods and concerns of philosophy. Those philosophers identified in this category often explicitly reject the assumptions of ethnophilosophy and adopt a universalist worldview of philosophy that requires all philosophy to be accessible and applicable to all peoples and cultures in the world This is even if the specific philosophical questions prioritized by individual national or regional philosophies may differ. Some African philosophers classified in this category are Paulin Hountondji, Peter Bodunrin, Kwasi Wiredu, Tsenay Serequeberhan, Marcien Towa and Lansana Keita. Nationalist and ideological philosophy Nationalist and ideological philosophy might be considered a special case of philosophic sagacity, in which not sages but ideologues are the subjects. Alternatively, it has been considered as a subcategory of professional political philosophy. In either case, the same sort of problem arises with retaining a distinction between ideology and philosophy, and also between sets of ideas and a special way of reasoning. Examples include African socialism, Nkrumaism, Harambee and Authenticite African ethics Although Africa is extremely diverse, there appear to be some shared moral ideas across many ethnic groups. In a number of African cultures, ethics is centered on a person's character, and saying \\"he has no morals\\" translates as something like \\"he has no character\\". A person's character reflects the accumulation of her deeds and her habits of conduct; hence, it can be changed over a person's life. In some African cultures, \\"personhood\\" refers to an adult human who exhibits moral virtues, and one who behaves badly is not considered a person, even if he is considered a human. While many traditional African societies are highly religious, their religions are not revealed, and hence, ethics does not center around divine commands. Instead, ethics is humanistic and utilitarian: it focuses on improving social functioning and human flourishing. On the other hand, social welfare is not a mere aggregate of individual welfare; rather, there is a collective \\"social good\\" embodying values that everyone wants, like peace and stability. In general, African ethics is social or collectivistic rather than individualistic and united in ideology. Cooperation and altruism are considered crucial. African ethics places more weight on duties of prosocial behaviour than on rights per se, in contrast to most of Western ethics. Africana philosophy Africana philosophy is the work of philosophers of African descent and others whose work deals with the subject matter of the African diaspora. This is a relatively new (since the 1980s) and developing name given to African thought, and it is given credible attention by professional organizations, including the American Philosophical Association. Africana philosophy includes the philosophical ideas, arguments and theories of particular concern to people of African descent. Some of the topics explored by Africana philosophy include: pre-Socratic African philosophy and modern day debates discussing the early history of Western philosophy, post- colonial writing in Africa and the Americas, black resistance to oppression, black existentialism in the United States, and the meaning of \\"blackness\\" in the modern world.

The agreement came about after long negotiations, public review through ICANN's public comment process, reviews within the UPU governing Councils and consideration by ICANN's Board of Directors. The sTLD was added to the IANA TLD registry August 8, 2012 when .post entered the root of the internet.  Purpose  .post was designed to serve the needs of the global postal community in cyberspace. The idea behind .post was to identify legitimate postal services and avoid confusion for individuals, business and stakeholders. As of October 2014, out of 192 UPU member countries, 38 are full members of the Dot Post Group (DPG), which is appointed to oversee the development of this platform. A few of those already launched their .post web site. Most of them offer a web interface to traditional post office services, such as printed letters and parcels delivery. One of them also features Postal Registered electronic Mail (PReM) among its services.  Authentication  To register a .post domain, the UPU asks entities to submit a Community ID request Registrants must be approved as being members of the .post Sponsored Community before registering domains. Prior to registering a .post domain, the UPU verifies the registrant's eligibility to register a domain name and issues a .post Community ID. Each applicant is required to provide legal proof of ownership of the string, as well as falling into 1 of 11 Registrant Groups set out in paragraph 3.3 of the .post Domain Management Policy References External links * Category:Postal services Category:Universal Postal Union Category:Sponsored top-level domains Category:Top-level domains Category:Internet properties established in 2009 Category:Computer-related introductions in 2009 de:Top-Level-Domain#Gesponserte Domains (sTLD) sv:Toppdom√§n#Generiska toppdom√§ner ","title":".post"},{"id":"1112542","text":"Metropolitan Transit Authority may refer to: * Metropolitan Transit Authority (Boston), succeeded by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) * Metropolitan Transit Authority (Victoria), Melbourne, Australia * Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority, Pennsylvania * Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas * Metropolitan Transit Authority (Miami-Dade), Florida * Nashville Metropolitan Transit Authority, Tennessee * Topeka Metropolitan Transit Authority, Kansas See also * Metropolitan Transportation Authority, New York * Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, California * R√©seau de transport m√©tropolitain, Montreal, Canada * MTA (disambiguation), for other things abbreviated \\"MTA\\" ","title":"Metropolitan Transit Authority"},{"id":"1112544","text":"The government of Great Britain was under the joint leadership of Prime Minister Robert Walpole (in the House of Commons) and Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend (in the House of Lords), from 1721 to 1730--when Townshend left the government.

The program had two runs on the CBS daytime schedule between February 1974 and June 1984. It was hosted by Bert Convy, with several announcers including Jack Clark, Gene Wood, Johnny Olson and John Harlan providing the voiceover at various times. Wood was the primary announcer during the show's first run, and Olson was announcing during the 1980s. The show's premise involved questions asked about celebrity couples' personal lives and was based on He Said, She Said, a syndicated Goodson-Todman show that aired during the 1969‚Äì70 season. Host Bert Convy was awarded a Daytime Emmy Award for hosting the show in 1977. Bert Convy and his wife, Anne, occasionally played the game during the 1970s run, most often during weeks in which the panel was made up entirely of other game show hosts and their spouses. Among the hosts who filled in for Convy during these episodes were Gene Rayburn, Bob Barker, Bobby Van, Jack Narz and Richard Dawson. All five hosts also participated in playing the game along with other hosts such as Allen Ludden, Bill Cullen and Chuck Woolery. Gameplay Host Bert Convy. The show changed its format after its first four months on the air. The second format remained for the rest of the show's run, including its later versions. Production for Tattletales was set up at Hollywood's Television City Studios in either Stages 31, 41, 43. In both formats, the show's set consisted of two parts. One was a desk behind which three players could sit. The other was a small seating area in the rear left corner of the stage, which was used to keep the players not in the game isolated; a sliding wall covered the seating area during gameplay and each player had a set of headphones to block out any noise from the other side of the wall. Usually, the game began with the husbands isolated and the wives onstage. When needed, the offstage players would appear on monitors in front of their spouses. The studio audience was divided into three color-code sections: red, yellow (which Convy jokingly nicknamed the \\"banana section\\"), and blue, each section of 150 members rooting for one celebrity couple. Audience members in each section divided the money their respective couples won. The couple with the most money at the end of the show won the game, earning their section a $1,000 bonus. In the event of a tie, those sections split the $1,000 bonus. A member of the winning section(s) was also randomly drawn to win additional prizes. Audience members received their winnings in checks distributed as they left the studio. Format #1 In the first format, Convy asked the players onstage two questions, which usually started with \\"It happened at...\\" or \\"A story involving...\\" and then Convy completed the question. After each question was read, a player onstage buzzed-in to answer the question. That player then gave a one- or two-word clue that the spouse would recognize. Convy then repeated the question to the offstage players, appearing on the monitors in front of their spouses, followed by the clue. The offstage player who buzzed in first answered the question, and if the couple's answers matched, they won money for their rooting section. A correct answer was worth $100 with a one-word clue, and $50 with a two-word clue. Convy then asked another question, usually multiple choice, called a \\"Tattletale Quickie,\\" to each couple in-turn. On their turn, each onstage player answered the question, and the spouse appeared and answered the same question. If the answers matched, the team won $100. The players changed places in the second round. Format #2 In June 1974, the game dropped the first type of question, and questions in the \\"Tattletale Quickies\\" format were used for the entire show (though the \\"Quickies\\" name was dropped). The scoring format also changed. Each question had a pot of $150, split among all couples who matched ($50 if all three matched, $75 if two matched and $150 if only one couple matched). If no one matched, the amount of the pot was added to the next question. The husbands were first asked two questions, after which the players changed places prior to the second round. The wives were then asked two more questions, with the value of the final question doubled to $300. The syndicated version offered the same; plus, one member of the winning rooting section(s), chosen at random, got six different parting gifts. Celebrities The guest couples on the premiere episode of Tattletales were Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, Bobby Van and Elaine Joyce, and Dick Gautier and Barbara Stuart. Among other celebrities that played the game were Bobby Troup and his wife Julie London, Bill Cullen and his wife Ann, Allen Ludden and his wife Betty White, Orson Bean and his second wife Carolyn Maxwell, Charlie Brill and his wife Mitzi McCall, Scoey Mitchell and his wife Claire Thomas, Ronald S. Kass and his wife Joan Collins, John Ritter and his wife Nancy Morgan, George Hamilton and his first wife Alana Stewart, Jay Leno and his wife Mavis Leno, Michael J. Fox and his girlfriend Nancy McKeon, John McCook and his second wife Juliet Prowse, Tommy Lasorda and his wife Jo, William Shatner and his second wife Marcy Lafferty, Patti Deutsch and her husband comedy writer Donald Ross, Phyllis Diller and her husband Warde Donovan, James Brolin and his wife Jane Cameron Agee, and As the World Turns co-stars Meg Ryan and Frank Runyeon, Bob Crane and his second wife Patti. Neither version had a hard rule that the celebrity couples were in fact married or romantically involved, although the 1982 version more frequently featured non-romantic couplings than the original run; the 80s version occasionally aired special weeks with teams consisting of TV couples, best friends, parent-child, and other combinations. On a March 1982 broadcast, Linda Blair stated on-air, in response to a question about romantic preferences, that her playing partner for that week, Jim Atcheson, was a close friend rather than a romantic interest. For one week in February 1975, gay comic actor Dick Sargent and lesbian comedian/author Fannie Flagg appeared on the show as a couple; Flagg was not introduced as Sargent's wife or girlfriend, or even friend, but rather \\"his lady\\". Gay actor and director Charles Nelson Reilly was booked on Tattletales during both CBS runs; his playing partner in 1977 was Elizabeth Allen, a long-time friend from his days on Broadway, and his partner on the show in 1982 was Julie Harris, another old friend from Broadway who was married to her third husband, Walter Carroll, at the time the program was produced. Broadcast history CBS placed Tattletales at 4:00 PM (Eastern)/3:00 PM (Central/Mountain/Pacific) when it premiered, replacing the long-running soap opera The Secret Storm. It formed the last third of an afternoon game show block that also included The Price is Right and Match Game '74. The show changed time slots three times in 1975. On June 16, CBS moved it to 11:00/10:00 AM. On August 11, after The Price Is Right returned to the morning, Tattletales moved to 3:30/2:30 PM. On December 1, it returned to its original time slot. On December 12, 1977, CBS moved Tattletales to the 10:00/9:00 AM in a scheduling shuffle with The Price Is Right and Match Game '77. Tattletales gradually began to lose viewers and ran its 1,075th and final show of the original version on March 31, 1978. It was replaced by Pass the Buck. A weekly nighttime version, syndicated by Firestone aired during the 1977‚Äì78 season, but was not renewed. In 1981, CBS asked Mark Goodson to bring Tattletales back, and it returned on January 18, 1982. It aired at 4:00/3:00 PM until June 1, 1984, when it was replaced by another Goodson show, Body Language. Episode status Both versions of Tattletales remain intact, but only a portion have been seen on Game Show Network: episodes of the CBS run from 1974 to 1977, selected episodes from the CBS run from 1977 to 1978, and several months of the 1982‚Äì84 run. GSN never reran the nighttime syndicated version. Episodes of the 1974‚Äì1977 daytime version of Tattletales can currently be seen on Buzzr. Two episodes of the nighttime syndicated version aired on Buzzr on February 9, 2020 as part of their \\"Love at First Sight\\" marathon. Merchandise Although there was never a home game released to the public, Hasbro did promote a home version of the show in their 1978 catalogue that was sent to retail stores nationwide, but was later scrapped when the show was cancelled in the same year. International versions An Australian version of Tattletales aired on the Seven Network as Celebrity Tattle Tales, hosted by Ugly Dave Gray for a brief time from 1979 to 1980, and was produced by Reg Grundy. The show was cancelled after being on the air for only three months. A Brazilian version of Tattletales ran on SBT from 1975 to 1986 under the name Ela Disse, Ele Disse (\\"She said, He said\\") hosted by Silvio Santos.

He was a municipal councillor in Winnipeg from 1973 to 1986 and a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1997. From 1988 to 1997, Ernst was a Cabinet minister in the government of Premier Gary Filmon. The son of Frank Luther Ernst and Stella Sarah Bryson, he was born in Winnipeg and was educated at St. Paul's College (affiliated with the University of Manitoba). He worked as a real estate and insurance broker before entering public life. Ernst was elected as a councillor in the amalgamated City of Winnipeg in 1973, and served as the city's deputy mayor from 1981 to 1986. During his time in municipal politics, Ernst was associated with the Independent Citizens' Election Committee, an unofficial alliance of right-wing business interests in the city. In 1967, he married Dorothy Lynn Blom. Ernst left municipal politics to run for the provincial legislature in the 1986 Manitoba general election. He was elected in the southwest Winnipeg riding of Charleswood as a Progressive Conservative, defeating his closest opponent by almost 4,000 votes. The seat had been vacated by former premier Sterling Lyon's retirement from electoral politics. The governing New Democratic Party (NDP) was narrowly re-elected, and Ernst joined 25 other Conservatives in opposition. In March 1988, disgruntled NDP backbencher Jim Walding brought down the government. The resulting election took place at a time when the Manitoba Liberal Party was making inroads into both PC and NDP areas of support; Ernst was only narrowly re-elected, defeating Liberal candidate Shari Nelson by fewer than 1,000 votes. The Conservatives, led by Gary Filmon, formed a minority government following this election. On May 9, 1988, Ernst was appointed Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, with responsibility for Development Corporation, Sport, the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act and the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act and Manitoba Forestry. The provincial Liberals had slipped in popularity by the provincial election of 1990, and Ernst was returned in Charleswood with minimal difficulty. After a cabinet shuffle on February 5, 1991, he was named Minister of Urban Affairs and Minister of Housing. After a further shift on September 10, 1993, he was named Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and Government House Leader, once again receiving responsibility for Sport, the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act, the Boxing and Wrestling Commission and (until May 9, 1995) the Manitoba Lotteries Foundation Act. Ernst and the Conservative government were convincingly re-elected in 1995. He was removed from cabinet following a shuffle on January 6, 1997, and resigned from the legislature that October 28. After leaving politics, Ernst was appointed Vice-President of Optx 2000, a research and development firm. He has also served as Chief Executive Officer of the Team Canada Volleyball Centre, and presided over the elimination of that organization's debt in 2002.

They formed their partnership in 1962, originally appearing as singers in local pubs around north-west England. According to an interview with Eddie Large in Metro newspaper (11 January 2019), they went professional in October 1963. After deciding to concentrate on comedy, Little and Large's big break came in 1971 when they appeared on ITV talent show Opportunity Knocks. They won the programme's vote, turning them into household names virtually overnight. Within five years, the duo had their own prime-time show on ITV called The Little and Large Tellyshow. It began with a pilot episode in 1976, which earned the pair a commission for a series in 1977. However, the duo transferred to BBC1 with a new show called The Little and Large Show from 1978, and remained on the channel for over a decade until its cancellation in 1991. At its peak, the series was watched by an estimated nearly 15 million people each week. Eddie Large was generally the funny man while Syd Little was the more serious 'straight guy'. Eddie Large performed a number of impressions, particularly cartoon characters like Deputy Dawg and Woody Woodpecker,'The Story of Light Entertainment' BBC Two, 25 February 2012 while Syd Little simply stood next to him, looking perplexed and distressed. They continued to appear in theatres and pantomimes, including Babes in the Woods, written by Ian Billings. The partnership's popularity peaked in the 1980s but, as mainstream comedy moved away from their pantomime style towards alternative comedy, it dwindled. Eddie Large was told he might have a heart attack at any moment. The partnership split up when Large had to have a heart transplant. Syd Little performed on cruise ships, such as the QE2, during September 2007, and used to run The \\"Little\\" Restaurant at the Strawberry Gardens pub and now runs a restaurant in the oldest pub in his home town Fleetwood, called The Steamer. Eddie Large remained in showbusiness. Large said in a 2010 interview he had not spoken to Syd Little for several years. They did subsequently have a reunion in 2018 when they appeared on Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, featuring in the sketch serial \\"Saturday Knight Takeaway\\", and in February 2019, appearing together on Pointless Celebrities. They reached the head-to-head round (in effect, the semi-final). On 2 April 2020, Eddie Large died following contraction of COVID-19.

Estelle Sharp, Hugh Potter, and the Hoggs created a telephone campaign which had River Oaks mothers make telephone calls to persuade Edison E. Oberholtzer, the HISD superintendent, into modeling the school's education program after John Dewey's ideals. River Oaks opened in 1929. As the school grew, more classrooms were added. First permanent additions were built. Later temporary buildings were set up on the school grounds.

By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. Vanguard and neighborhood program controversy On March 2, 1995, HISD board trustee Ron Franklin introduced a request by the River Oaks neighborhood to have a neighborhood school at the board table. Parents from River Oaks, Oak Estates, Royden Oaks, and Avalon Place pressured the school into adding back a neighborhood program. Some Vanguard parents felt concern with the proposal, because they liked the Vanguard program and feared that introducing neighborhood children would adulterate the Vanguard program, believing that River Oaks parents would use political influence and money to have underqualified children admitted to the Vanguard program. Some parents believed that the River Oaks neighborhood program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1995 the school had about 500 students, with 40% White, 30% Black, 28% Hispanic, and 1% Asian. Large numbers of parents who were White, Black, and Hispanic protested against the proposal.Markley, Melanie. \\"Regardless of where they live, parents ask same question: How good are the schools?\\" (). Houston Chronicle. October 13, 1996. Accessed July 12, 2008. Donald R. McAdams, a former HISD trustee and the author of Fighting to Save Our Urban Schools-- and Winning!: Lessons from Houston, stated that Vanguard parents were afraid of having to give up complete control over the school and share power with neighborhood parents.McAdams, p. 171. During that year, the HISD school board voted on a proposal to open the school to neighborhood parents. The four White board members voted in favor, while the five non-White board members voted against it. Lana Shadwick, an assistant attorney of the Harris County government, campaigned for the HISD board to allow neighborhood enrollment at River Oaks. Two board members, Esther Campos and Robert Jefferson, said that an entity, through intermediaries at the request of Shadwick, offered $50,000 in board election campaign contributions if they would change their votes, and threatened to rally a group of parents to campaign for their opponents if they did not change their votes.

Laurie Bricker, a white HISD board member, introduced a new plan that allowed parents of Vanguard students to include their non-Vanguard children in the neighborhood classes along with River Oaks neighborhood students.McAdams, p. 192. Bricker had the neighborhood program as a phase-in to appease Vanguard parents but some minority HISD trustees did not like that aspect of her program. On March 21, 1996, the board voted in favor of Bricker's program 5‚Äì2, with 2 abstaining. Many neighborhood parents accepted the plan. Some Vanguard parents had objected.

The playground for smaller children was to be located in the center of the play area tract, the playground for older boys was to be located on the south side of the play tract, and the playground for older girls was to be located on the north side of the play tract. The plan called for trees to be planted parallel to sidewalks along Avalon Road, Kirby Drive, and San Felipe Road. The auditorium was built square-shaped. Its kindergarten area once housed a fireplace, which, along with its chimney, was given to the school by Ima Hogg. In 2005 the fireplace was moved to the teacher's lounge during renovations, and it was later placed in the attic. As of 2010 there were efforts to restore the fireplace, with donations being the source of funding. Azalea flowers, used in the landscaping of various Houston landmarks, have been present in the landscaping of this school.Becker, Charles Dain and Joan Blaffer Johnson with Ann Dunphy Becker.

In November 2008 the alumni of River Oaks Elementary started a campaign to raise $3.4 million ($ when adjusted for inflation) to build a new library. They had already received a $1 million ($ when adjusted for inflation) gift. The plans for the library included a reading area with 16,500 books, a technology center with 32 computers, and a courtyard. Jennifer Radcliffe of the McClatchy - Tribune Business News said \\"The addition would put the River Oaks library -- which already has one of the largest collections in HISD -- head and shoulders above other campuses.\\" Barry Bishop, a director of library information at the Spring Branch Independent School District, said that the expansion of the River Oaks Elementary library \\"kind of shakes the equity issue\\" but because schools with poorer pupils have access to federal funds, foundation funds, and grants inaccessible to schools with wealthier student bodies, \\"If you actually look at the money spent per student, at least from the library perspective, it kind of balances out.\\" A neighborhood activist from Sunnyside, Alice Pradia, argued that HISD did not do enough to bolster libraries of school campuses.

() Donald R. McAdams wrote that in 1995, at the time of the political turf battle involving River Oaks Elementary and neighborhood students, River Oaks was a \\"middle class school.\\"McAdams, p. 170. The student mix was 40% White, 30% Black, 28% Hispanic, and 1% Asian. 9% of students qualified for free and reduced lunch. According to HISD standards, all of the students were gifted and talented. McAdams wrote that most of the minority children classified as gifted and talented by HISD came from middle class households. In 1995, the largest group of River Oaks Elementary School parents resided in the City of West University Place and nearby neighborhoods. McAdams wrote that in 1995 White parents liked the demographics because there was a \\"high-cost, first class education in an almost perfect ethnic mix, and all this with ethnic harmony.\\" McAdams wrote that the demographics made the school attractive to River Oaks parents who wanted to send their children there. Academics and gifted and talented designation Donald R. McAdams wrote that in 1995 River Oaks was \\"not really full of gifted children\\". He cited the fact that, at the time, HISD put ethnic balances on the gifted and talented roster, with no more than 35% White and Asian and at least 65% Black and Hispanic overall, leading many White and Asian children to be excluded. In addition McAdams cited the mechanisms for gifted testing at the time. As of 1995, under Texas state law a gifted child was defined as one in the 95th percentile. Testing for gifted and talented status took place at Kindergarten. McAdams wrote that many children identified as gifted under this formula were simply well-educated by their parents and that this became apparent in the third grade. However a school would not dismiss a child already identified as gifted at that point. In 1997 HISD removed the ethnic guidelines to Vanguard enrollment after a reverse discrimination lawsuit was filed in a federal court.McAdams, p. 175. McAdams wrote that in 1995, compared to other Vanguard programs River Oaks test scores were on the \\"low\\" side. McAdams stated that eight neighborhood schools in trustee district 5, his district, had higher average test scores than River Oaks. Those schools had minority enrollments from 27% to 52%.

Literary magazines usually publish short stories, poetry, and essays, along with literary criticism, book reviews, biographical profiles of authors, interviews and letters. Literary magazines are often called literary journals, or little magazines, terms intended to contrast them with larger, commercial magazines.  History  Nouvelles de la r√©publique des lettres is regarded as the first literary magazine; it was established by Pierre Bayle in France in 1684. Literary magazines became common in the early part of the 19th century, mirroring an overall rise in the number of books, magazines, and scholarly journals being published at that time. In Great Britain, critics Francis Jeffrey, Henry Brougham and Sydney Smith founded the Edinburgh Review in 1802. Other British reviews of this period included the Westminster Review (1824), The Spectator (1828), and Athenaeum (1828). In the United States, early journals included the Philadelphia Literary Magazine (1803‚Äì08), the Monthly Anthology (1803‚Äì11), which became the North American Review, the Yale Review (founded in 1819), The Knickerbocker (1833‚Äì1865), Dial (1840‚Äì44) and the New Orleans-based De Bow's Review (1846‚Äì80). Several prominent literary magazines were published in Charleston, South Carolina, including The Southern Review (1828-32) and Russell's Magazine (1857-60). The North American Review, founded in 1815, is the oldest American literary magazine. However, it had its publication suspended during World War II, and the Yale Review (founded in 1819) did not; thus the Yale journal is the oldest literary magazine in continuous publication. Begun in 1889, Poet Lore is considered the oldest journal dedicated to poetry. By the end of the century, literary magazines had become an important feature of intellectual life in many parts of the world. One of the most notable 19th century literary magazines of the Arabic-speaking world was Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa. Among the literary magazines that began in the early part of the 20th century is Poetry magazine. Founded in 1912, it published T. S. Eliot's first poem, \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\". Other important early-20th century literary magazines include The Times Literary Supplement (1902), Southwest Review (1915), Virginia Quarterly Review (1925), World Literature Today (founded in 1927 as Books Abroad before assuming its present name in 1977), Southern Review (1935), and New Letters (1935). The Sewanee Review, although founded in 1892, achieved prominence largely thanks to Allen Tate, who became editor in 1944.History Two of the most influential‚Äîthough radically different‚Äîjournals of the last-half of the 20th century were The Kenyon Review (KR) and the Partisan Review. The Kenyon Review, edited by John Crowe Ransom, espoused the so-called New Criticism. Its platform was avowedly unpolitical. Although Ransom came from the South and published authors from that region, KR also published many New York-based and international authors. The Partisan Review was first associated with the American Communist Party and the John Reed Club; however, it soon broke ranks with the party. Nevertheless, politics remained central to its character, while it also published significant literature and criticism. The cover of Tin House, a literary magazine published in Portland, Oregon The middle-20th century saw a boom in the number of literary magazines, which corresponded with the rise of the small press. Among the important journals which began in this period were Nimbus: A Magazine of Literature, the Arts, and New Ideas, which began publication in 1951 in England, the Paris Review, which was founded in 1953, The Massachusetts Review and Poetry Northwest, which were founded in 1959, X Magazine, which ran from 1959 to 1962, and the Denver Quarterly, which began in 1965. The 1970s saw another surge in the number of literary magazines, with a number of distinguished journals getting their start during this decade, including Columbia: A Journal of Literature and Art, Ploughshares, The Iowa Review, Granta, Agni, The Missouri Review, and New England Review. Other highly regarded print magazines of recent years include The Threepenny Review, The Georgia Review, Ascent, Shenandoah, The Greensboro Review, ZYZZYVA, Glimmer Train, Tin House, Half Mystic Journal, the Canadian magazine Brick, the Australian magazine HEAT, and Zoetrope: All-Story. Some short fiction writers, such as Steve Almond, Jacob M. Appel and Stephen Dixon have built national reputations in the United States primarily through publication in literary magazines. The Committee of Small Magazine Editors and Presses (COSMEP) was founded by Hugh Fox in the mid-1970s. It was an attempt to organize the energy of the small presses. Len Fulton, editor and founder of Dustbook Publishing, assembled and published the first real list of these small magazines and their editors in the mid-1970s. This made it possible for poets to pick and choose the publications most amenable to their work and the vitality of these independent publishers was recognized by the larger community, including the National Endowment for the Arts, which created a committee to distribute support money for this burgeoning group of publishers called the Coordinating Council of Literary Magazines (CCLM). This organisation evolved into the Council of Literary Magazines and Presses (CLMP). Many prestigious awards exist for works published in literary magazines including the Pushcart Prize and the O. Henry Awards. Literary magazines also provide many of the pieces in The Best American Short Stories and The Best American Essays annual volumes.  Online literary magazines  SwiftCurrent, created in 1984, was the first online literary magazine. It functioned as more of a database of literary works than a literary publication. In 1995, the Mississippi Review was the first large literary magazine to launch a fully online issue. By 1998, Fence and Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern were published and quickly gained an audience. Around 1996, literary magazines began to appear more regularly online. At first, some writers and readers dismissed online literary magazines as not equal in quality or prestige to their print counterparts, while others said that these were not properly magazines and were instead ezines. One of the first literary magazines was The Morpo Review, published by a group from Omaha, Nebraska, in the 1990s. Since then, though, many writers and readers have accepted online literary magazines as another step in the evolution of independent literary journals. There are thousands of online literary publications and it is difficult to judge the quality and overall impact of this relatively new publishing medium.\\"Technology, Genres, and Value Change:the Case of Literary Magazines\\" by S. Pauling and M. Nilan. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 57(7):662-672 doi10.1022/asi.20345 Little magazines Little magazines, often called \\"small magazines\\", are literary magazines that publish experimental literature and the non-conformist writings of relatively unknown writers. Typically they had small readership, were financially uncertain or non-commercial, were irregularly published and showcased artistic innovation. The earliest significant examples are the transcendentalist publication The Dial (1840‚Äì44), edited by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller, in Boston, and The Savoy (1896), edited by Arthur Symons, in London, which had as its agenda a revolt against Victorian materialism. Little magazines were significant for the poets who shaped the avant-garde movements like Modernism and Post-modernism across the world in the twentieth century.

Aysun, together with his father Sulayman al- Arabi, joined Charlemagne's army that besieged Zaragoza in 778. When Zaragoza failed to surrender, Charlemagne took hostages from his allies, including Sulayman. Aysun and his brother Matruh ben Sulayman al-Arabi were allied to the Basques, and at Roncesvalles they attacked the baggage train of the Frankish army in 778, releasing their father. Their father returned to Zaragoza and sent to Matruh to govern Barcelona (and Girona). However, in 780 Sulayman was killed by his former friend and Husayn of Zaragoza. As a result, Aysun gave his loyalty to the Emir of Cordoba who was seeking to impose control over the northern Iberian states. He participated in the assault on Zaragoza in 781 (that compelled to Husayn submit) and in subsequent expeditions into Basque territories and Cerda√±a, moving on then to Barcelona where his brother as Wali also submitted to the Emir. Aysun had two servants called Amrus (later General Amrus ibn Yusuf) and Sabrit, who after 785 served Matruh. Matruh rebelled and took Huesca and Zaragoza in about 789. However, Matruh was killed by Amrus (who became a supporter of the Emir) and Sarhabil ibn Saltan al-Zawagi in 791 or 792. Later life Al-Udri reports that Aysun was taken prisoner during the capture of Girona and sent to Aachen. According to Al-Udri, Aysun later escaped with the assistance of his servant Amrus. Aysun shares his name with Aiss√≥, leader of a revolt in 826. It has accordingly been suggested by historians including Al-Udri that as an elderly man Aysun escaped in the 826, to lead the revolt of the Goths and supporters of peace with the Muslims. However, there is no evidence to prove this, and it may simply have been a confusion of two different people with similar names.

Its name is derived from professional, indicating its intended use by certified professionals. History In October 2000 Jason Drummond came up with the concept for a new top level domain name (TLD) and established RegistryPro to jointly bid with Register.com for .pro. In May 2002 RegistryPro signed its contract with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) the organization that administers global domain names; under which it will operate the registry for the new top level domain (TLD) .pro. The domain was originally launched in June 2004 with registrations restricted to four professions: accountants, engineers, lawyers and medical professionals in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. In March 2005, the registrar EnCirca introduced its controversial ProForwarding service which enabled unverified people and businesses to register domains. Registrants then had thirty days to provide verified credentials prior to their domain being activated. Total registrations reached 6,899 by January 2008. Following consultation with ICANN, the domain was relaunched in September 2008 with a wider remit to include government certified professionals in all countries. Registrants are required to self-certify their professional status and agree to terms of use before registration, then subsequently provide detailed license information. In 2012, RegistryPro was acquired by Afilias Limited. Registrations The official domain website describes the eligibility criteria as follows: *Applicant provides professional services *Applicant is admitted to or licensed by a government certification body or jurisdictional licensing entity recognized by a governmental body that regularly verifies the accuracy of its data. *Applicant is in good standing. The domain registry allows registration of third-level domains in the following domains: *Legal: law.pro, avocat.pro, bar.pro, jur.pro, recht.pro *Accountancy: cpa.pro, aaa.pro, aca.pro, acct.pro *Medical: med.pro *Engineering: eng.pro As of April 2011, the domains may be registered through 44 accredited domain registrars. In January 2011, the number of registered domains surpassed 100,000.

April 21, 2014 Meb was born in Eritrea on May 5, 1975, the third son of Russom and Awetash Keflezighi. At the time, Eritrea was embroiled in an often-brutal 30-year war for liberation from Ethiopia (Eritrea finally achieved independence in 1993), and Russom was a liberation supporter. This meant that he sometimes had to leave his home in Adi Beyani to escape Ethiopian soldiers and their brutal massacres. Meb recalls that his childhood included regular encounters with death and dismemberment of his Eritrean friends and neighbors. He didn't see a car until he was 10 yrs old. Thinking it was a death machine, he took flight. \\"That was one of the races I lost,\\" he once told the New York Times. Awetash feared that her husband would be killed, and eventually convinced him to flee Ethiopia for a better life. He ended up in Milan, Italy, for 5 yrs, sending money home until he could afford to bring the family to Italy. That reunion took place in 1986, and afforded Meb his first chance to watch TV. He couldn't figure out how the actors got inside the small box. A year later, the Keflezighis moved to San Diego, arriving on October 21, 1987, and eventually settling into a 3-bedroom apartment that now held 8 family members, including the 6 children. Eventually, the Keflezighis would have 10 children. Russom worked as many jobs as he could find, but insisted that his children focus their attention on schoolwork. Meb began running while a student at Memorial Academy in San Diego, where he ran a 5:10 mile before going on to win both the 1600 meters and 3200 meters at the CIF California State Championships in 1994 for San Diego High School.See YouTube highlights.

Initially a trio of guitar, bass, and drums performing in an identifiable post-punk style, the band soon pioneered a dynamic use of digital sampling in addition to standard rock instruments. While commercially unsuccessful during their existence, the band is considered to be a key post- rock act. History Disco Inferno formed in 1989 in Essex by teenagers Ian Crause (guitars and vocals), Paul Willmott (bass), Daniel Gish (keyboards) and Rob Whatley (drums), although Gish soon quit the band to join Bark Psychosis, leaving Disco Inferno as a trio. They were initially a post-punk band heavily influenced by bands such as Joy Division and Wire, releasing their first album Open Doors, Closed Windows in July 1991, alongside the \\"Entertainment\\" single, also from 1991, and 1992's Science EP, all of which were compiled onto the compilation album In Debt (1992). However, Crause soon became infatuated with the unique sounds of bands My Bloody Valentine and the Young Gods, as well as the Bomb Squad's hip hop production and sampling on the music of Public Enemy, and with the release of the Summer's Last Sound EP, released later on in 1992 by, the band's musical style changed towards sample-based electronic sounds. The band \\"hit upon a seemingly simple but ultimately world-opening idea\\" with the EP: to write their instruments through samplers, and unlike their contemporaries who sampled elements of music, film dialogue or other media, Disco Inferno \\"engaged with the whole world\\", using their set up to record sounds ranging from running water, the wind, whistling birds, boots, car crashes and angry voices. Crause had purchased a Roland S-750 sampler with his savings and started programming towards the band's sound for six months. In a 2011 interview, Wilmott recalled of the era: The production style of Public Enemy and the Bomb Squad was an important influence on Disco Inferno. Summer's Last Sound was praised for its uncompromising, innovative and experimental sound, and the group expanded the approach with their subsequent EPs A Rock to Cling To (1992) and The Last Dance (1993), both of which were released on Rough Trade Records after their previous label Cheree closed. According to Andy Kellman of AllMusic, the new label \\"saved the band's life, as the members believed that they were too challenging for anyone else to understand or care for.\\" Kellman commented that, \\"disorienting, confusing, and highly schizophrenic, the challenging releases were in direct contrast to the prevailing Britpop scene of the time,\\" taking \\"A.R. Kane's futurist pop a couple steps further and secured a devout and small following that found solace in their wildly imaginative, peerless nature.\\" The band became characterized as one of the first post-rock bands. In a 2011 interview, Crause explained \\"Most of these other what are now called post-rock groups, I think they regarded us as a kind of tinker-toy group because of the pop songs and the sampling so there was little chance of them deciding to follow us in the sampling - no critical consensus had been built for them to aspire to it - we kind of got ours from Public Enemy, who were too black and the Young Gods, who sang in French, for fuck's sake! And it wasn't seen as 'serious' enough, perhaps meaning it wasn't seen as commercially viable enough... who knows. Anyway, I did it 'cos I had the ideas.\\" The band's musical approach reached its peak on their second album D. I. Go Pop, released in February 1994. The album's music was harsh and concise, with the melody on the eight tracks often carried by the bassline, while an array of samples (including running water, breaking glass, car crashes and fax machines) built the musical collages. After D. I. Go Pop the band opted for restraint on the Second Language EP, which also featured a new-found optimism in Crause's lyrics. The band's next single, \\"It's a Kid's World\\", sampled the drumbeat from Iggy Pop's \\"Lust for Life\\" and added in a series of old children's TV themes. Despite critical acclaim, Disco Inferno attracted little commercial success. Combined artistic and financial pressure began to erode their sense of common purpose and loyalty. The band split acrimoniously in 1995, prior to the release of their final album, Technicolour, which was released in July 1996. In September 1999, the Tugboat label released The Mixing It Session, which featured six instrumental tracks the band had recorded for radio, while One Little Indian Records reissued D. I. Go Pop and gave Technicolour a belated US release in 2004. In September 2011, One Little Indian released a compilation entitled The 5 EPs, featuring tracks from all five of the now out-of-print EPs released between 1992 and 1994. Subsequent projects Ian Crause After the split, Ian Crause formed Floorshow who recorded some material for an unreleased album which was to be called The Vertical Axis. Some of these songs later appeared on his solo singles in the early 2000s (\\"Elemental\\" and \\"Head Over Heels\\"), which featured drummer Ritchie Thomas (Dif Juz, The Jesus and Mary Chain). Crause would then spend the best part of a decade away from music and eventually left the UK to move to Bolivia. Crause returned to music in mid-2012 with a track called \\"More Earthly Concerns\\", which resurrected Disco Inferno's sample-heavy textured approach and was released via various blogs. This was followed in November 2012 by \\"The Song of Phaethon\\", a long-form single release on Bandcamp inspired by both Greek mythology and British involvement in the Second Gulf War. Several other tracks (\\"The Vertical Axis\\", \\"Suns May Rise\\", \\"Black Light\\", and \\"A World of Ghosts\\") were released on Bandcamp in early 2013. Crause's long-delayed debut solo album, The Vertical Axis (also a Bandcamp release) followed in December 2013. Paul Wilmott Paul Wilmott formed Transformer, who recorded a cover of Wire's \\"Outdoor Miner\\", which appeared on the Wire tribute album, Whore (1996). He would later play in the short-lived London Records-signed trip hop band Lisp. Discography Albums *Open Doors, Closed Windows (Ch√©, July 1991) *D. I.

The Du'a is not an exclusively Shi'a dua, however, as none of its content is controversial among Shi'a and Sunni schools of thought. According to Allama Majlesi, Kumayl ibn Ziyad, a confidante of Ali ibn Abi Talib had attended an assembly in the Mosque at Basra which was addressed by Imam Ali in the course of which the night of the 15th of Sha'aban (a month) was mentioned. Ali said :\\"Whosoever keeps awake in devoutness on this night and recites the Du'a of Prophet Khidhr, undoubtedly that person's supplication will be responded to and granted.\\" When the assembly at the Mosque had dispersed, Kumayl called at the house where Ali was staying, and requested him to acquaint him with Prophet Khidhr's supplication. Ali asked Kumayl to sit down, record and memorise the du'a which he dictated to Kumayl. Ali then advised Kumayl ibn Ziyad to recite this du'a on the eve of (i.e. evening preceding) every Friday, or once a month or at least once in every year so that, added Ali, \\"Allah may protect thee from the evils of the enemies and the plots contrived by impostors. O' Kumayl! in consideration of thy companionship and understanding, I grant thee this honour of entrusting this du'a to thee.\\" Considered one of the famous supplications, that of Khidr, Ali choose to teach this du'a to Kumayl as his disciple. The Du'a al-Kumayl is specifically recited for \\"protecting against the evil of enemies, for opening the gate of one's daily bread and for the forgiveness of sins.\\" The Du'a al- Kumayl is to be recited specifically \\"during the nights of the middle of Sha'ban and every Thursday evening.\\" As the Du'a al-Kumayl is such well known, it has become a fixture of great Islamic tradition within the Sufi world and the larger Muslim faith. Composed by Khidr and passed down through Ali to Kumayl and beyond, the Du'a al-Kumayl has proven its value in the Islamic faith. Sheikh Tusi (460 AH / 1067 CE) and Sayyid ibn Tawus (664 AH / 1271 CE) both record this prayer under the acts of worship for the 15th of Sh'ban. Sheikh Tusi names this prayer \\"Du'a al-Khadir\\" and narrates that Kumayl ibn Ziyad saw Imam 'Ali narrate this prayer while he was in sujood (prostration).Introduction to Du'a Kumayl Text A manner of reciting Du'a Sample passages from Kumayl supplication O He in whose hand is my forelock! O He who knows my affliction and my misery! O He who is aware of my poverty and indigence! My Lord! My Lord! My Lord! I ask You by Your Truth and Your Holiness And the greatest of Your Attributes and Names, That You make my times in the night and the day inhabited by Your remembrance, And joined to Your service And my deeds acceptable to You, So that my deeds and my litanies may all be a single litany And my occupation with Your service everlasting. ... ... And protect me with Your mercy! And make my tongue remember You without ceasing And my heart enthralled by Your love! And be gracious to me by answering me favorably, And nullify my slips And forgive my lapses! ... ... O He, whose satisfaction is quickly achieved! Forgive him who owns nothing but supplication For You do what You will O He whose Name is a remedy, And whose remembrance is a cure, And whose obedience is wealth! Have mercy upon him whose main wealth is hopefulness And whose weapon is weeping! You can see the complete English text of Du'a Kumayl here and also here via video with English subtitle. Du'a A Du'a, or supplication, is largely an appeal to God on behalf of oneself or another. This appeal, or invocation may be one calling for blessings or evil. This personal prayer differs from the alternative liturgical prayer of salat. Muslims practice salat, a fixed vocal prayer, regularly for the five prayers of the day. In contrast, a du'a, or mental prayer, is a private, inward prayer often of meditation, fikr. A du'a may address God in any circumstance to which one may be afflicted. Environmental conditions and how to pray, adab, have been suggested to Muslims praying intimately with God through Du'a. These suggested \\"rules\\" are intended to guarantee the efficacy of a du'a, enhancing the legal purity of the gesture. Widely considered a request for one's own or a community's well being, a du'a serves as a direct spiritual connection with God. while a du'a may or may not be promptly or accurately answered, reason always lies behind God's spiritual deliverance of prayer requests. The outcome that God suffices, will always produce a greater benefit to all, rather than to that of the individual. The interpretation of one's personal interaction with God through du'a presents several differences. A distinction is often made, however, between fixed predetermination, kada, suspended predetermination and universal determinism. Belief in fixed predetermination suggests that a prayer cannot change God's will, while he may grant prayers implored of Him. In contrast, suspended or conditional predetermination states that while God predetermines all creation's fate, the deity may grant prayers based upon a conditional decree. Lastly, the view of universal determinism claims that the granting of a prayer is a direct result of terrestrial dispositions in accordance with celestial causes, thus through the laws of the macrocosm. The heartfelt attempt to rationalize du'a suggests the importance of supplication with God to the Islamic faith.'' The Role of Du'a A du‚Äôa, or supplication, serves as an intimate express of oneself to God. While some Du‚Äôas may be declarations directly from the heart, many are transcribed prayers passed down from the Prophet and his Companions, thus becoming a part of Islamic tradition. A Du‚Äôa‚Äôs composition itself is often unknown, however, many were written during a time of great spiritual commitment. During the time of the Prophet and his Companions, spiritual devotion through the concept of tawhid, recitation of the Qur‚Äôan and remembrance of God were an important aspect of many lives. Within Islamic faith, du‚Äôa is a primary means of devotion to God in accordance with Divine Will. Through the negation of personal desires and attributes, a Muslim may strengthen ones relationship with God through the guidance and imitation of a trained companion of God. Often short and easy to recite, du‚Äôas are often a means to ensure ones focus on God at all times, an important trait of fana, or self-annihilation as one loses themselves to God. The practice of teaching and guiding Muslims in faith has been carried down for multiple generations. Beginning with the Prophet, Imams were taught the practice of du‚Äôa, recitation of the Qur‚Äôan and spiritual devotion, then in turn the great Companions were the next to learn. At the time of the Prophet and today, the role of guide along one‚Äôs spiritual path still serves to enrich one‚Äôs religious life. For it is the duty of all possessing the knowledge to pass it on, thus supplications were recorded for annual public occasions and inward prayer alike. The role of Du‚Äôa is to form an intimate relationship with God through learning his will, supplication, recitation of the Qur‚Äôan and spiritual devotion.''

She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1990 to 1999, and was a senior cabinet minister of the government of Gary Filmon. Early life and career Vodrey was born Rosemary Webster, the daughter of senior Toronto police officer Jack Webster.Radha Krishnan, \\"Orchard out of hot seat\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 September 1993; Gwyn \\"Jocko\\" Thomas, \\"Copper Jack leaves a legacy\\", Toronto Star, 12 September 2000, 1; Ellis Quinn, \\"Police veteran 'Copper Jack' Webster\\", Toronto Star, 29 June 2002, B3. She studied Psychology at the University of Toronto before moving to Winnipeg with her partner. Vodrey later became a school psychologist, and lectured in Home Economics at the University of Manitoba.Bruce Owen, \\"Rosie Rosi\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 June 1996, B1; Frances Russell, \\"Row with judges shows Vodrey's flaw\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 July 1994. She became politically active after befriending Gary and Janice Filmon,Shane Minkin, \\"Vodrey at odds with news media\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 June 1996, B4. and sought election to the Manitoba legislature in the 1988 provincial election in the central Winnipeg division of Osborne. She finished third, behind Liberal candidate Reg Alcock and incumbent New Democrat Muriel Smith. Member of the Legislative Assembly Vodrey ran for the legislature a second time in the 1990 provincial election, and defeated incumbent Liberal Laurie Evans in the Fort Garry division in south-central Winnipeg.She had completed her first year of law studies by this time. See David Roberts, \\"Manitoba Justice Minister proud of get-tough tactics\\", Globe and Mail, 18 February 1995, A4. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government, and Vodrey entered the legislature as a government backbencher. She faced a credible challenge from Liberal Jim Woodman in the 1995 provincial election, but was re-elected as the Filmon government won a second majority across the province.Frances Russell and Gerald Flood, \\"Ridings hold hope for Grits\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 April 1995. Vodrey served as co-chair of the party's campaign management committee in 1995. See Frances Russell, \\"Truth lost in the shuffle\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 February 1999, A10. Cabinet minister Minister of Education and Training Vodrey was appointed to Gary Filmon's cabinet on January 14, 1992, replacing Len Derkach as Minister of Education and Training.\\"Filmon replaces education minister\\", Toronto Star, 15 January 1992, A120. Derkach had previously been accused of interfering in the civil service hiring process. Some criticized Filmon's choice, arguing that Vodrey's decision to send her own children to private school made her an inappropriate choice to oversee the public system.Winnipeg Free Press columnist Jim Carr would later write that Vodrey never fully recovered from this early criticism. See Jim Carr, \\"Dog days offer a chance to reflect on cabinet\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 7 August 1993. ;Court decisions There were two important court decisions relating to education during Vodrey's tenure as Education Minister. In August 1992, a provincial judge determined that a section of the Manitoba Public Schools Act requiring mandatory Christian prayer in the classroom was unconstitutional.David Roberts, \\"Canada's last bastion of school prayer falls\\", Globe and Mail, 14 August 1992, A1. Manitoba was the last Canadian province to require prayer in public schools, and Vodrey did not challenge the decision. In March 1993, the Supreme Court of Canada issued a unanimous decision requiring Manitoba to give exclusive control over French- language education to the province's francophone community. Vodrey welcomed this decision, saying that her government was already proceeding with legislation and promising that a new francophone school division would be in place by September.Sean Fine, \\"Let francophones control schooling, Manitoba ordered\\", Globe and Mail, 5 March 1993, A4. Manitoba's francophones generally supported the framework plan that was introduced two months later.Don Campbell, \\"French division proposal on table\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 May 1993; Arlene Billinkoff, \\"French school battle avoided\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 May 1993. ;Budget cuts The Filmon government introduced austerity measures on education in 1993, including a $16 million cut to public education funding and a 2% cap on school tax increases. Many parents opposed the cuts, while trustees criticized the cap as an encroachment on the autonomy of their boards.Brad Oswald, \\"Vodrey won't legislate teacher salary rollbacks\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 March 1993; Brad Oswold, \\"Santos gives MAST ultimatum\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 March 1993. Vodrey later rejected a request from the Manitoba Association of School Trustees (MAST) to introduce wage freezes that would absorb some of the resulting financial burden, though she did agree to a separate proposal that allowed boards not to pay their staff for as many as eight professional development days.Brad Oswald, \\"Vodrey won't legislate teacher salary rollbacks\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 March 1993; Aldo Santin, \\"Trustees ask Vodrey for freeze Minister says she'll refuse, but would help cut in-services\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 March 1993; Aldo Santin, \\"School staff face layoffs, loss of pay\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 March 1993. For an editorial sympathetic to the trustees' position, see Terry Moore, \\"Handcuffed trustees\\", '\\"Winnipeg Free Press, 21 March 1993. Manitoba's universities were also affected by the austerity drive, with officials at the University of Manitoba predicting layoffs and restricted access to some courses. Vodrey's decision to cap tuition increases at 5% was nevertheless described as relatively favourable to student interests.Brian Cole, \\"Arts enrolment to be curbed by budget, U of M dean says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 March 1993. Vodrey also announced cuts to rural and northern clinician services, as well as the elimination of Manitoba's post-secondary bursary program, a 35% cut to her department's New Careers program, and a 75% surcharge on tuition fees for international students.Aldo Santin, \\"Teachers target cuts in media blitz\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 March 1993; Donald Campbell, \\"Bursary program scrapped\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 May 1993; Don Campbell, \\"Job-training program cut disclosed\\", '\\"Winnipeg Free Press, 15 May 1993; Jim Carr, \\"Wisdom needed\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 25 October 1993. See also \\"Students inherit debt\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 11 May 1993; Terry Moore, \\"Improving student aid\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 11 May 1993. She argued that the cuts were necessary as part of her government's response to a debt crisis. Some in the media speculated that Finance Minister Clayton Manness, rather than Vodrey, was the primary instigator of this policy.Aldo Santin, \\"Principals blame politicians\\", 12 April 1993; Jim Carr, \\"Some fresh old faces\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 11 September 1993. ;Other initiatives Vodrey unveiled a task force report on Manitoba education in April 1993, highlighted by recommendations that the province assume all costs for special-needs children and that parents be given a greater role in education. John Plohman, education critic for the opposition New Democratic Party, welcomed the report but expressed concern that many of its recommendations would never be implemented by the Filmon government.Paul Samyn, \\"Province unveils education report\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 April 1993. In July 1993, Vodrey established a provincial commission to review Manitoba's school division boundaries. The five-person commission was headed by former Winnipeg Mayor Bill Norrie, and was given 16 months to conduct its research. Some critics expressed concern that the commission's work would lead to fewer and larger divisions.Stevens Wild, \\"School mergers expected\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 July 1993. See also Stevens Wild, \\"U of M prof condemns school review\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 July 1993. Vodrey favoured greater cooperation with the federal government to establish national goals and standards for education.Paul Samyn, \\"Federal learning plan gets passing grade\\", '\\"Winnipeg Free Press, 14 April 1993. In Canada, education is traditionally the domain of the provinces. ;Assessments In a June 1993 editorial, Winnipeg Free Press columnist Jim Carr described Vodrey as \\"perhaps the biggest disappointment\\" in the Filmon cabinet. He characterized her treatment of school boards as \\"cavalier\\", and wrote that she had demonstrated little interest in improving the public school system.Jim Carr, \\"Time for a Shuffle\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 27 June 1993. Frances Russell also described Vodrey's performance as \\"inept\\". See Frances Russell, \\"'Teflon premier' feels heat\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 September 1993. For a different perspective, see Campbell Alexander, \\"In defence of Mrs. Vodrey\\" [letter], Winnipeg Free Press, 10 July 1993. He later described her as \\"little more than a messenger of bad news\\" to school divisions and universities, while also writing that her skills might be better suited to a \\"less sensitive portfolio\\".Jim Carr, \\"Dog days offer a chance to reflect on cabinet\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 7 August 1993. In 1995, the Winnipeg Free Press reported that the Filmon government had quietly shifted funds away from public and post-secondary education and into private training programs and private schools between 1988 and 1993.Aldo Santin, \\"Revolving door at top has educators in tizzy\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 April 1995. Minister of Justice Vodrey was promoted to Minister of Justice and Attorney General on September 10, 1993, with additional ministerial responsibility for Constitutional Affairs and the Status of Women. She was retained in these positions after the 1995 provincial election. ;Criminal justice Vodrey's first major decision as Justice Minister was to call an emergency summit of police, educators and community groups, following the fatal stabbing of a 16-year-old boy in Winnipeg.Dan Lett, \\"Boy's death spurs drive for action\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 September 1993. See also Bud Robertson, \\"Street kids scorn summit\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 October 1993; Paul Samyn, \\"Summit seeks strategy to curb youth violence\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 December 1993. The summit took place in December, and featured diverse opinions on the effectiveness of Canada's Young Offenders Act.Randy Turner, \\"Youth jails bulging at seams\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 December 1993. Two months after the summit, Vodrey brought forward a crime reform package that included wilderness boot camps for young offenders, increased police surveillance of gangs, violence prevention workshops, a school violence coordinator, and a youth gang and violence phone line that would both receive confidential information and provide counseling services.Paul Samyn, \\"Vodrey tough enough?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 February 1994. The telephone line was introduced in June of the same year. See Glen MacKenzie, \\"'Fink line' aims to cut youth crime\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 June 1994. Vodrey's proposal for boot camps was very controversial. New Democratic Party Justice critic Gord Mackintosh described it as \\"a simplistic, sensational way of pandering to vengeance\\", while some social workers argued the camps would actually reinforce criminal behaviour.Dave Bedard, \\"Youth boot camps not answer, social workers say\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 February 1994; Frances Russell, \\"U.S. boot camps don't work\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 March 1994; Frances Russell, \\"Boot camps not the answer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 April 1994. Aboriginal leaders also expressed concern that these camps could have the same negative effect on native children as did the residential school system, and criticized Vodrey for not seeking input from indigenous groups.Jon Jenkins, \\"Natives demand input into boot-camp plans\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 February 1994; Tom Brodbeck, \\"Natives 'miffed' at minister for not asking about boot camps\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 May 1994. Others argued that Vodrey's proposal had merit, and deserved to be given a trial run.Terry Moore, \\"Give boot camp a try\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 22 February 1994; Fred Cleverley, \\"Getting a break in a boot camp\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 April 1994. See also David Vienneau, \\"Army-style boot camp a cure for teen thugs, Manitoba says\\", Toronto Star, 24 March 1994, A14; David Roberts, \\"Manitoba marching toward 'boot camps'\\", Globe and Mail, 27 April 1994, A1. In response to criticism, Vodrey promised that the camps would be humane and non- abusive, unlike the harsh, military-style youth camps that had been introduced previously in the United States.Maureen Houston, \\"Humane boot camps' vowed\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 May 1994; Terry Moore, \\"The bootie camps\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 19 May 1994. Vodrey formally opened two camps in September 1994, though opposition critics suggested that her department had simply made minor adjustments to existing youth correction services.Paul Wiecek, \\"Kids off to camp - and it won't be fun, Vodrey vows\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 September 1994; Paul Samyn, \\"Boot camps kicked about\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 October 1994. In mid-1995, Mackintosh argued that few of Vodrey's youth crime initiatives had actually been implemented. See Alice Krueger, \\"Vodrey scolded on crime\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 August 1995, B3; Alice Krueger, \\"Crime-busting phantoms hit\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 November 1995, A9. During the same period, Vodrey also closed down a Teen Adventure Groups program for delinquents and at-risk youth. Some had credited this wilderness- activity based program with improving the lives of participants. See Allison Bray, \\"Teens learned to trust until program dumped\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 January 1996, A1. Vodrey also introduced legislation to make parents financially liable for the property offenses of their children. Critics questioned the effectiveness of this measure, noting that many of the affected families would already be low-income.Paul Samyn, \\"Parents will pay for crime\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 May 1996, A1; Ruth Teichrob, \\"Vodrey's new law won't help anyone\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 2 June 1996, B2; Michael Fitz- James, \\"The sins of the child visited upon the parents \\", Financial Post, 18 June 1996, p. 12; Robert Sheppard, \\"The parent trap\\", Globe and Mail, 3 July 1996, A13. The measure was passed by Vodrey's successor, Vic Toews, in 1997. Vodrey's plan to take driver's licenses from young offenders was less controversial, and won the support of the NDP opposition.Paul Samyn and Stevens Wild, \\"Punks walk in Tories' plan\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 April 1994. She later brought forward legislation compelling parents who refuse to pay child support to lose their licenses, joint holdings, and pension credits.Car thieves and vandals were also targeted. Paul Samyn, \\"Rip off car, lose licence\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 June 1994; Alice Krueger, \\"Deadbeat parents targeted Vodrey proposes tough penalties\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 January 1995. The NDP also supported this proposal, but expressed concern that Vodrey did not provide for automatic financial deductions. See Alice Krueger, \\"Mothers applaud Vodrey\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 January 1995. The legislation was passed in 1995.Ruth Teichrob, \\"The best intentions\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 March 1995; Alice Krueger, \\"Tories revive maintenance bill\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 June 1995, B2; Linda Quatrain, \\"Single parents upset unchanged bill\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 June 1995, B2; Alice Krueger, \\"Tough new measures target deadbeat parents\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 July 1995, B6. Later in the year, Manitoba's acting ombudsman reported that most of its reforms had not yet been implemented, and that no significant change had taken place in the child support system.Alice Krueger, \\"Deadbeat collection under fire\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 December 1995, A1. In early 1996, Vodrey introduced significant fine increases for offenses such as speeding and under- age drinking.\\"Manitoba hiking car fines\\", Globe and Mail, 12 April 1996, N6. In February 1995, Vodrey introduced a policy that allowed law enforcement agencies to publicize the names of high-risk sex offenders being released from prisons into Manitoba communities. This was believed to be the first such policy in Canada,Alice Krueger, \\"Sexual predators targeted\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 February 1995; Alice Krueger, \\"Panel has broad powers\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 February 1995; Jim Carr, \\"A response to fear\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 10 February 1995. and some expressed concern that it could provoke vigilantism.Frances Russell, \\"Vodrey invites vigilantism\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 16 February 1995; David Roberts, \\"Manitoba Justice Minister proud of get-tough tactics\\", Globe and Mail, 18 February 1995, A4. Vodrey also announced changes to the province's prisons in early 1995, including a ban on television during the day, fewer telephone calls, reduced visit time, and a stricter work regimen.Allison Bray, \\"From country club to budget hotel?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 February 1995. The executive director of the John Howard Society of Manitoba criticized the initiative, arguing that it would do nothing to reduce recidivism. In December 1995, Vodrey launched a provincial task force to make civil courts more responsible, accessible and efficient. Critics noted that the Manitoba Bar Association had already set up a similar task force, which included a member appointed by Vodrey's department.Paul Samyn, \\"Second look at court reform\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 December 1995, A4. ;Relations with the federal government As provincial Justice Minister, Vodrey often encouraged the federal government to toughen provisions of the Young Offenders Act. In 1994, she proposed that the government publicize the names of young offenders when doing so would increase public safety, lower the age of criminal responsibility below 12 for repeat and \\"heinous\\" offenders, and make parents financially liable for the property offenses of their children.Paul Samyn, \\"Talking tough on punks\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 March 1994. The government of Alberta supported Vodrey's approach, while Ontario and Quebec favoured more cautious reforms.\\"Split won't halt changes in youth law\\", Hamilton Spectator, 25 March 1994, A3. In early 1995, federal Justice Minister Allan Rock announced that he would accept Vodrey's proposal to name offenders, but would not lower the age of criminal responsibility or make parents liable.Paul Samyn, \\"Rock rejects plans for tougher laws Vodrey's anti-stalking push turned away\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 January 1995. Vodrey had criticized Rock's changes to the Young Offenders Act the previous year, describing them as inadequate. See Ross Howard, \\"Youth rehabilitation loses priority\\", Globe and Mail, 3 June 1994, A1. Vodrey suggested several changes to Canada's anti-stalking laws in early 1995, including a reverse-onus bail clause for alleged stalkers, a provision that stalkers who kill their victims be deemed automatically guilty of first-degree murder, and a requirement that persons convicted of stalking submit their weapons and licenses to authorities.Stephen Bindman, \\"Anti-stalking law to be beefed up: Manitoba views spark changes\\", Toronto Star, 16 January 1995, A1; Paul Samyn and Dan Lett, \\"Tougher stalking laws studied\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 January 1995; Glen MacKenzie, \\"System criticized in deaths\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 January 1995. Rock's reform package, announced in late 1995, included Vodrey's recommendation for mandatory first-degree murder charges.Dan Lett, \\"Feds to stiffen penalty for stalkers who kill\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 December 1995, B5. Vodrey later supported Rock's effort to increase penalties for violent and sexual offenders.Dan Lett, \\"Grits target worst cons\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 September 1996, A1. Vodrey opposed the creation of the Canadian gun registry, and refused to administer the program in Manitoba.Paul Samyn, \\"Vodrey backs gun owners\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 November 1994; Frances Russell, \\"Anti-gun law ministers fire blanks\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 May 1995; Dan Lett, \\"Just say no to registration\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 September 1995, A11; Brian Laghi, \\"Provinces fight gun registry\\", Globe and Mail, 27 September 1996, A1. ;Judiciary In December 1993, opposition parties and aboriginal groups called for an independent inquiry into complaints about controversial provincial judge Bruce McDonald. McDonald had been suspended from the bench in May 1993 after the Winnipeg Free Press ran a series of investigative articles into his handling of family law cases, drawing particular attention to prejudiced statements he had made about women and indigenous Canadians. He later resigned from the bench just as a judicial review into his conduct was scheduled to begin. Vodrey argued that McDonald's resignation obviated the need for a public review, and said that further concerns could be raised during a planned overhaul of the judicial council the following year.Ruth Teichrob, \\"Case closed, Vodrey says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 December 1993; Ruth Teichrob, \\"Growing outrage over judicial inaction spurs call for probe\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 December 1993; Ruth Teichrob, \\"Ex- chief judge sparks new calls for investigation\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 December 1993. In December 1994, Vodrey announced that future judicial reviews could be permitted to continue even if the judges in question decide to resign.Kevin Rollason, \\"Judges won't escape inquiries, Vodrey says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 December 1994. The Filmon government imposed ten unpaid Fridays per year on provincial judges as a cost-cutting measure in the early 1990s. Several judges criticized this decision, arguing that it created an unacceptable backlog in the system. In July 1994, the Manitoba Provincial Judges Association filed legal papers alleging that the government had threatened to withhold a pay raise if the judges proceeded with a planned lawsuit over the matter. Vodrey declined to comment, but opposition parties accused the government of treating judges like civil servants.Paul Samyn, \\"Tories accused of attempt to blackmail, stifle judges\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 July 1994; Kevin Rollason, \\"Judges censure province, Winnipeg Free Press, 5 July 1994. Vodrey appointed Judith Webster as Chief Justice of the Provincial Court of Manitoba in December 1993. Webster was the first woman to hold this position.Paul Samyn, \\"Webster named chief judge\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 December 1993. ;Other In February 1994, the federal and provincial governments joined with indigenous groups to establish a new funding formula for police services in aboriginal communities. In supporting the pact, Vodrey said that it would allow aboriginal input into the allocation of funds. Critics noted that it did not provide for the immediate restoration of native-run police agencies, most notably the Dakota Ojibway Tribal Council (DOTC) force that had been dismantled the previous year.\\"Police pact faulty: MLA Native-run forces needed, Grit says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 February 1994; \\"Chiefs warn lives at risk\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 February 1994. Later in the year, Vodrey signed an interim agreement to provide for the DOTC force's return.Don Langford, \\"Reserves to receive police service 'soon'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 April 1994. Vodrey announced a provincial gun amnesty program in May 1994, in which Manitobans were encouraged to turn in illegal firearms without fear of arrest.\\"Province to announce gun amnesty\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 May 1994. The project yielded 500 weapons, including explosives and three machine guns.\\"3 machine-guns, explosives all part of gun-amnesty yield\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 December 1994. Later in the same year, Vodrey granted the Brandon police force permission to carry semi-automatic handguns.\\"New police guns\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 September 1994. On October 23, 1995, Vodrey gave Winnipeg Mayor Susan Thompson $2 million to hire forty new police officers for the city. Some skeptics noted that this event took place two days before the 1995 municipal election, in which Thompson was facing a difficult challenge from two rival candidates. Vodrey denied there was any attempt to influence the outcome of the vote.Nick Martin, \\"Vodrey's gift for mayor raises eyebrows\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 October 1995, A1; Jim Carr, \\"We're not that dumb\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 October 1995, A10. Vodrey commissioned a civil justice review task force in early 1996, to review the province's handling of divorce and child-custody cases and to prevent damage being done to spouses, children and families.Bruce Owen, \\"Forum to seek ways to ease pain\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 April 1996, A2. ;Headingley Jail Riot A serious riot broke out at Manitoba's Headingley Correctional Institution on April 25, 1996. Eight guards and about forty prisoners were injured, some seriously, as a group of inmates ransacked parts of the jail for the better part of a day. By the end of the riot, the prison had no heat or electricity and the actual building was largely destroyed.David Roberts, \\"Police end riot at Manitoba jail; 8 guards injured\\", Globe and Mail, 27 April 1996, A1. Several guards later complained that staff cutbacks and unsafe working conditions were ongoing concerns in the period leading up to the violence.Randy Turner, \\"Angry guards fear inmates will strike again\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 April 1996, A1. Vodrey announced an independent review into the riot, but rejected requests for a full-scale public inquiry.Paul Samyn, \\"Vodrey orders inquiry into riot\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 April 1996, A4. Prison guards across the province subsequently went on a three-day strike, seeking both an inquiry and the resignation of several officials responsible for overseeing the prison, including Vodrey.Linda Quattrin, \\"Angry jail guards walk out\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 May 1996, A1; David Roberts, \\"Manitoba guards refusing to work RCMP officers staff 7 prisons\\", Globe and Mail, 7 May 1996, A1; Allison Bray, \\"Guards say concerns real, ignored too long\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 May 1996, A2. The opposition New Democratic Party also criticized Vodrey's response to the crisis, arguing that she was not forthcoming about the number of prisoners released from other prisons to alleviate overcrowding when inmates were transferred from Headingley.Bruce Owen, \\"Rosie Rosi\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 June 1996, B1; Shane Minkin, \\"Vodrey at odds with news media\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 June 1996, B4; Paul Samyn, \\"Judges left in the dark after riot\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 October 1996, A5. These criticisms were reduced somewhat after Vodrey appointed respected former judge Ted Hughes to conduct the inquiry. Hughes submitted a report in December 1996 that described Headingley as having been a social powder keg before the riot, with serious problems in both safety and labour relations. He also described Vodrey as \\"surprisingly\\" ignorant of these problems in her capacity as minister.Alice Krueger, \\"Vodrey admits some regrets\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 December 1996, A4. Vodrey accepted responsibility, and expressed regret that she did not know of the prevailing circumstances at the prison.David Roberts, \\"Attack roots of crime, report on prison riot urges\\", Globe and Mail, 10 December 1996, A10. ;Assessments Vodrey became known for making high-profile policy announcements during her time in the Justice portfolio, and there was some speculation she would eventually be a candidate to succeed Gary Filmon as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party.Jim Carr, \\"Post-Filmon era beckons\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 28 July 1994; David Roberts, \\"Manitoba Justice Minister proud of get-tough tactics\\", Globe and Mail, 18 February 1995, A4; Paul Samyn, \\"Filmon cabinet to get facelift\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 April 1995. This speculation ended after the Headingly riot, which did serious damage to her political standing. Some Winnipeg Free Press journalists noted that street gangs and juvenile crime actually increased during the period of Filmon and Vodrey's hardline approach.Brian Cole, \\"Preventing crime\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 7 February 1997, A14. Minister of Culture, Heritage and Citizenship Vodrey was reassigned as Minister of Culture, Heritage and Citizenship on January 6, 1997. She retained ministerial responsibility for the Status of Women, and was also given responsibility for Multiculturalism and the Liquor Control Act. In June 1997, Vodrey introduced legislation to change Manitoba's access to information rules for the provincial and municipal governments and crown corporations. She also brought forward a companion bill for the protection of personal health records, which was intended to allow Manitoba's public health system to be transferred online. Some doctors expressed concern about the latter measure, arguing that patient privacy could not be ensured.Alice Krueger, \\"Bill broadens access to information\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 June 1997, A4. The access to information bill was expected to be less controversial, but was nonetheless met with opposition from journalists and others who argued that it would reduce public access to government files, and to electronic files in particular.Alice Krueger, \\"Information access bill alarms group\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 June 1997, A3; Tom Oleson, \\"Shameful legislation\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 23 June 1997, A6; Alice Krueger, \\"Citizens argue Bill 50 bad for democracy\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 June 1997, A3; David Roberts, \\"Manitoba bill still flawed, critics say\\", Globe and Mail, 25 June 1997, A9. Vodrey revised the bill in response to this criticism.Fred Vallance-Jones, \\"Access to information\\", Media Magazine, Spring 1998, accessed 20 November 1998. Vodrey announced several cultural grants in the summer of 1997, including $1.5 million to the Franco-Manitoban Heritage Centre and $400,000 to the Portage Community Centre Inc.\\"Heritage centre ground broken at building site\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 July 1997, A5; Bud Robertson, \\"Portage centre to get $400,000 from province\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 August 1997, A7. In June 1998, she appointed a Ministerial Millennium Advisory Committee to advise on the best ways of celebrating the millennium.\\"Manitobans to mull over the millennium\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 June 1998, A4. See also \\"Advisory Council seeks ideas for projects to mark millennium\\" [government press release], M2Presswire, 6 January 1999; \\"Province budgets $10M for millennium\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 May 1999, A11. Vodrey changed the governance structure of Manitoba Film and Sound in late 1998, establishing a nine-member board appointed by the provincial government.Paul McKie, \\"Nine-member board named to run Manitoba film industry\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 September 1998, A4. One of her final acts in office was to oversee a financial bailout of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra.\\"Tories make good on WSO bailout\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 July 1999, 6. Vodrey also oversaw Manitoba's immigration policy during her time as Minister of Culture. In 1998, the province received a $7 million funding increase for immigration from the federal government, and was given a direct role in recruitment strategies.\\"Manitoba gets boost on immigration\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 June 1998, A1. In early 1998, Vodrey and three other politicians were awarded robes of honour from Winnipeg's Sikh community.Claudia Garcia, \\"Sikhs honour 4 politicians\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 January 1998, A4. Minister responsible for the Status of Women In 1995, Vodrey introduced a $50,000 scholarship program for women entering high-technology fields at Manitoba community colleges. Female enrollment in these programs was very low at the time.Paul Samyn, \\"Province willing to pay for 50 high-tech women\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 January 1995. In the same year, she was an official observer at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.Alice Krueger, \\"Manitobans take views to Beijing\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 August 1995, A10. She announced an anti-stalking initiative in 1996, allowing Manitobans to remove their names from provincial land title documents as a means of keeping their addresses confidential.Paul Samyn, \\"Land titles access altered in bid to thwart stalkers\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 March 1996, A8. In 1996, journalist Lindor Reynolds wrote that Vodrey had a mixed record of effectiveness on women's issues. Reynolds noted that Manitoba's domestic abuse committee, started by former Justice Minister Jim McCrae, was shut down after Vodrey became Justice Minister in 1993. However, she commended Vodrey for releasing a 50-page guide entitled \\"Stop The Violence\\" that was used by women's shelters, crisis workers, doctor's offices and counselors.Lindor Reynolds, \\"Guide may save victims of violence\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 March 2008, A4. Minister responsible for the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission Vodrey introduced a review of the province's four existing private wine stores in May 1997.Alice Krueger, \\"Gov't denies it is looking at privatizing liquor stores\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 May 1997, A3. The following year, she announced that the Filmon government would begin licensing private sales throughout the province. Jim Maloway of the New Democratic Party described this as \\"privatization by stealth\\", and expressed concern that the province would eventually privatize the Liquor Control Commission.Doug Nairne, \\"MLCC uncorks wine sales\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 July 1998, A1. Federal politics Vodrey was co-chair of Kim Campbell's Manitoba campaign in 1993, during her ultimately successful bid to succeed Brian Mulroney as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.Larry Kusch, \\"Supporters crank up Manitoba campaign\\", '\\"Winnipeg Free Press, 27 March 1993. Out of politics Vodrey announced in March 1999 that she would not be a candidate in the next provincial election.\\"Vodrey won't seek re-election\\", Globe and Mail, 18 March 1999, A7; Doug Nairne, \\"Vodrey jumps Tory ship\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 March 1999, A5. She formally resigned from cabinet with the rest of the Filmon ministry on October 5, 1999.

The film stars Dominique Labourier as Julie and Juliet Berto as C√©line. It won the Special Prize of the Jury at the Locarno International Film Festival in 1974 and was an Official Selection at the 1974 New York Film Festival. Plot summary The film begins with Julie sitting on a park bench reading a book of magic spells when a woman (C√©line) walks past, and begins dropping (√† la Lewis Carroll's White Rabbit) various possessions. Julie begins picking them up, and tries to follow C√©line around Paris, sometimes at a great pace (for instance, sprinting up Montmartre to keep pace with C√©line's tram). After adventures following C√©line around the Parisian streets--at one point it looks as if they have gone their separate ways, never to meet up again--C√©line finally decides to move in with Julie. There are incidents of identity swapping, with C√©line pretending to be Julie to meet the latter's childhood sweetheart, for example, and Julie attempting to fill in for C√©line at a cabaret audition. The second half of the film centers around the duo's individual visits to 7 bis, rue du Nadir-aux-Pommes, the address of a mansion in a quiet, walled off grounds in Paris. While seemingly empty and closed in the present day, the house is yet where C√©line realizes she knows as the place where she works as a nanny for a family--two jealous sisters, one widower, and a sickly child. Soon, a repetitive pattern emerges: C√©line or Julie enters the house, disappears for a time, and then is suddenly ejected by unseen hands back to present day Paris later that same day. Each time either C√©line or Julie is exhausted, having forgotten everything that has happened during their time in the house. However, each time upon returning via a taxi the women discover a candy mysteriously lodged in their mouth. It seems to be important, so each makes sure to carefully save the candy. At one point, they realize that the candy is a key to the other place and time; sucking on the sweet transports them back to the house's alternative reality (in this case a double reference to both Lewis Carroll and to Marcel Proust's madeleine) of the day's events. The remainder of the film consists of the two women attempting to solve the central mystery of the house: amidst the jealous conniving of women of the house over the attentions of the widower, a young child is mysteriously murdered. But this narrative is one that repeats like a stage play, with exact phrases they soon learn well enough to start joking about. Each time they repeat eating the candy, they remember more of the day's events. Just as if reading a favorite novel, or again watching a beloved movie, they find that they can enter the narrative itself, with each twist and turn memorized. Far from being the passive viewers/readers that they were at first--and most movie viewers always are--the women come to realize that they can seize hold of the story, changing it as they wish. Now, even as the plot continues to unfold in its clockwork fashion, the women begin to take control, making it \\"interactive\\" by adding alterations to their dialogues and inserting different actions into the events unreeling in the house. Finally, in a true act of authorship, they change the ending, and rescue the young girl who was originally murdered. Both realities are fully conjoined when, after their rescue of the girl from the House of Fiction, the two not only discover themselves transported back in Julie's apartment, but this time it isn't another \\"waking dream\\" for the young girl, Madlyn, has joined them, safely back in 1970s Paris. To relax, C√©line, Julie, and Madlyn take a rowboat on a placid river, rowing and gliding happily along. But something isn't quite right. They go silent upon seeing another boat quickly coming to pass them on the water. On that boat we see the three main protagonists from the house-of- another-time: that alternate reality has followed them back to their world. But C√©line, Julie, and Madlyn see them as the antique props they are, frozen in place. The film ends as we watch C√©line this time, half nodding off on a park bench, who catches sight of Julie hurrying past her, who in her White Rabbit way, drops her magic book. Picking it up, she calls and runs after Julie. Themes Magic is one of the themes of the film. C√©line, the stage magician, does her magic tricks in a nightclub performance. Magic seems to come too from Julie's Tarot card readings. Finally, \\"real\\" magic comes from the design of a potion, which enables both women to enter the house and take charge of the narrative. At the start, the two women are leading relatively conventional lives, each having jobs (Julie, a librarian, is more conservative and sensible than C√©line, a stage magician, with her bohemian lifestyle). As the film develops, C√©line and Julie separate from the world by leaving their jobs, moving in together, and gradually becoming obsessed with the mysterious and magical events in the old house. In one scene, according to critic Irina Janakievska, Julie is playing Tarot cards, with one of the cards interpreted as signifying that Julie's future is behind her--exactly when we see C√©line, wearing a disguise, observing Julie from one of the library desks. As C√©line draws an outline of her hand in one of the books, Julie echoes that as she plays with a red ink pad. Another noticeable aspect of the film is its use of puns. For instance, the title of the film, C√©line et Julie vont en bateau, has other meanings from that of taking a boat ride: \\"aller en bateau\\" also means \\"to get caught up in a story that someone is telling you\\", or, in English, getting taken up in a \\"shaggy dog story\\".

National Mall by the Million Mom March organization to call for stricter gun control. The march reportedly drew an estimated attendance of 750,000 people at the D.C. location, but with 150,000 to 200,000 people holding satellite events in more than 70 cities across the country, the total number of participants was about one million. A counter-rally by the pro- firearm Second Amendment Sisters, was also held on the same day. History The Million Mom March began as a grassroots movement sparked by Donna Dees- Thomases after she viewed broadcast coverage of the Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting in Granada Hills, California. In October 1999, she and several Tri-State activists from the New York metropolitan area held a news conference in Manhattan, where they announced their intent to march in Washington. The march was held on May 14, 2000 to coincide with Mother's Day, with the organization reporting a turnout of 750,000 supporters. Following the event the organization became chapter-based and merged with the victim-led pro-gun control group Bell Campaign. In 2001 the Million Mom March organization merged with the Brady Campaign. On the anniversary of the first march, more than 100 rallies were held across the nation calling for stricter gun laws at the state level. In New York, Republican Governor George Pataki joined Democratic U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton in a show of support for stricter gun laws. Turnouts to the second Washington march and to further marches were diminished, with the 2001 march on Washington reporting about 200 in attendance. The group did not plan demonstrations in Washington in 2002 or 2003, instead focusing its efforts in the states. Debate Gun rights advocates have routinely challenged the Million Mom March on its use of statistics on child gun casualties with individuals and organizations on both sides of the gun debate either verifying or criticizing the group's data. In 2004, Wendy McElroy estimated that only 5,732 children under the age of 17 died in gun related deaths, \\"or roughly 40 percent of what MMM asserts.\\" An investigation by The New York Times reported that the incidence of accidental child firearm deaths occur \\"roughly twice as often as the records indicate\\" due to idiosyncrasies in how authorities in various states classify these incidents. The report also asserted that the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups utilize the lower statistics in order to lobby against more restrictive gun laws.

He retired in 1975 and became a best-selling author of comedy books. In 1980, his comedy album Cinderelly was nominated for a Canadian Juno Award.

Clouston married Ida Bridden at St. John's Topsail Anglican Church on November 25, 1933, and they remained together until her death. Clouston died aged 94, and was survived by their two children (Carol Ann and Ian Bridden; died 2008), four grandchildren (Nancy, Doug, John, and Elizabeth), and five great- grandchildren. Alwyn was the son of John Clouston, grandson of Thomas Clouston (both of St. John's), and the great-grandson of John Clouston, a stonemason from Kirkwall, Orkney (early 19th century). He was almost certainly related (at least distantly) to Brian Clouston, Sir Edward Clouston, 1st Baronet, Storer Clouston and William Alexander Clouston, as the surname Clouston is (according to Storer Clouston in his book Family of Clouston) exclusive to descendants of Haakon Harvardson Klo, from whom the name derives.

The game was released in North America on August 5, 1993, in Japan on August 6, 1993, and in Europe in 1993. Rocket Knight Adventures was designed by Nobuya Nakazato, designer of several titles in the Contra series such as The Alien Wars, Hard Corps and Shattered Soldier. Its protagonist is Sparkster, an opossum knight who fights an army of robots and pigs, many of whom are piloting various mechanical vehicles. Sparkster is armed with a sword that can project energy over a short distance and a rocket pack that allows him to fly.  Gameplay  Rocket Knight Adventures Gameplay is often a side scrolling platform, with linear runs through levels. The player is able to jump, attack with Sparkster's sword, either directly or by \\"shooting\\" energy forward when swung, or charge up their rocket pack and go flying in one of the 8 standard directions, depending of the direction the player presses (if no direction is pressed, Sparkster performs a stationary spinning attack). Levels are occasionally switched up with alternate styles of gameplay. Some levels are horizontal scrolling shooters (akin to Gradius, often with in-level references to that game), while one level has the player controlling a large machine to duel with Axel Gear. The difficulty levels in the game are differently presented in each regional version of the game. Both the Japanese and European versions have two difficulty levels accessible normally via the options menu, while in the American version four are enabled by default.  Plot  The first King El Zebulos repelled some invaders in a powerful ship called the Pig Star and was made ruler of the land. Knowing the Pig Star had the power to destroy entire worlds, El Zebulos had it placed under a magic seal for safekeeping. The \\"Key to the Seal\\" would be guarded and passed down by El Zebulos, and his Royal Family. Generations into the future, the kingdom has been subject to attack by neighboring countries which wanted control of The Pig Star. To protect the kingdom of Zebulos, an elite group of warriors known as the Rocket Knights were formed. These Warriors wore armor with Rocket Packs, wielded mystical swords, and harnessed awesome combat skills. Around this time, an orphan named Sparkster was taken in by Mifune Sanjulo; a friend of the King, and current leader of the Rocket Knights. Sparkster was trained to become a Rocket Knight at an early age. Later on, a corrupt Rocket Knight by the name of Axel Gear fought and wounded Mifune as he tried to steal an ancient book, which contained the secrets of the rocket knights. Sparkster was appointed the new Rocket Knight leader and spent 10 years posing as an outlaw as he searched for Axel Gear, only to return to Zebulos and hear rumors about Axel Gear's return. By now the Kingdom is under attack by the Devotindos Empire led by Emperor Devligus Devotindos; who is said to have the power of hypnosis. Sparkster finds that Axel Gear has kidnapped Princess Sherry in attempt to blackmail the king into surrendering The \\"Key to the Seal\\". However it just so happens that the Princess is the only one who knows of its location. Sparkster rushes through jungles, caves, and even into Devotindos territory to save the princess, until he finally confronts Devilgus himself, who quickly flees after he gets the \\"Key to the Seal\\" from the Princess and takes off into space to The Pig Star. The Princess casts a spell on Sparkster to allow him to go after Devilgus and into The Pig Star. Sparkster fights the Emperor himself, only to discover he was a machine all along. Exploring the spaceship shows that Devilgus was not unique as the ship was a factory of Devilgus robots. After Devilgus' destruction, Sparkster runs into Axel Gear, who tries to jettison Sparkster into space, but gets sucked into space instead. Inside the ship's core, Sparkster discovers that the real Devligus was the Pig Star's core itself, hinting that the Emperor Devilgus was but a robotic proxy sent to Earth to establish an empire to invade Zebulos in an attempt to break free from its confinement. The ship's core attempts to destroy Sparkster. However, its efforts fail as The Pig Star explodes, and it makes a last-ditch effort to kill Sparkster while he is defenseless in an escape pod, eventually burning apart in Elhorn's atmosphere. Sparkster escapes in one piece and reaches the castle with Princess Sherry. Satisfied that the kingdom is safe, Sparkster flies off to continue his duties.  Development   Ports, sequels and spin-offs  A SNES version of Rocket Knight Adventures was planned, but was never released. Two follow-up titles Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2 on the Mega Drive, and Sparkster on the SNES were released. Despite both games being produced simultaneously and sharing the same name and box art, they were different games, sharing only their character design and music score, with the Mega Drive release acting as a direct sequel and the SNES game being a spin-off. The two titles are often confused for being the same game due to the \\"Rocket Knight Adventures 2‚Äù subtitle only being employed in Japan. In October 2009, Konami announced they would release another sequel, titled Rocket Knight (which is the sequel to the Sega Megadrive/Genesis game called Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2, but not really a remake of the Sega Megadrive/Genesis game called Rocket Knight Adventures), made by the British developer, Climax Group. The game was released on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Steam on May 12, 2010. Nobuya Nakazato was not involved with this title in any way, though Nazakato was credited by the developers in the Special Thanks section of the game credits. Sparkster has appeared as a playable character in a few recent titles, such as New International Track & Field for Nintendo DS and Krazy Kart Racing for iPhone and iPod Touch. He also has cameos in Ganbare Goemon 2: Kiteretsu Sh≈çgun Magginesu for the SNES, Snatcher for the Mega-CD, Jikky≈ç Power Pro Wrestling '96: Max Voltage for the SNES, Mitsumete Knight for the PlayStation, They was disguised by Pastel in TwinBee PARADISE in Donburishima for PC, and a figure resembling him also appears in an alternate ending to Contra: Shattered Soldier for the PlayStation 2, and as nonogram pixel on Pixel Puzzle Collection for the iPhone and Android. A Sparkster comic was written by Nigel Kitching in the UK-made Sonic the Comic. It was based on the Mega Drive/Genesis version of Sparkster. In an interview, Kitching said that Sparkster was the easiest game to adapt into a story, due to being similar to the Sonic the Hedgehog games. He was working on a second Sparkster story, but the plan was dropped when Fleetway were unable to obtain permission from Konami to use the character.  Reception  Sparkster stood out in the Animal mascot era, with gamers labeling him a second prodigy for Sega behind Sonic. Rocket Knight Adventures was well received by critics, who praised the music and graphics. HonestGamers gave the game a 9/10. Sega-16 gave it the same mark, saying that \\"it is not only one of the system‚Äôs best titles, it‚Äôs one of the greatest platformers ever made.\\"  References   External links  * Category:1993 video games Category:Konami franchises Category:Konami games Category:Platform games Category:Cancelled Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sega Genesis-only games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Steampunk video games Category:Video games scored by Aki Hata Category:Video games scored by Akira Yamaoka Category:Video games scored by Michiru Yamane Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Rocket Knight Adventures"},{"id":"1112672","text":"Bakke may refer to: ;Denmark *Amager Bakke, a waste-to-power incinerator plant in Copenhagen, Denmark *Bispebjerg Bakke (building), an apartment complex in Copenhagen, Denmark ;Norway *Bakke, Norway, former municipality in Vest-Agder county in Norway *Bakke Abbey in Trondheim, Norway *Bakke Church (Trondheim), a church in Trondheim municipality in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway *Bakke Church (Vest-Agder), a church in Flekkefjord municipality in Vest-Agder county, Norway ;United States *Bakke Mountain, a summit in Florida, Massachusetts *Bakke Graduate University in Dallas, Texas ;Other * De Bakke, an area near Hermanus, South Africa *Bakke (surname) See also *Regents of the University of California v.

The act was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, by voice vote, on October 4, 2004; was passed by the U.S. Senate, by unanimous consent, on October 6, 2004; and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 20, 2004. It is codified, as amended, at 22 U.S.C. 5811 note. The law expresses the sense of Congress that the Belarusian authorities should not receive various types of non-humanitarian financial aid from the U.S. It also calls for the President to report to Congress on arms sales by Belarus to state sponsors of terrorism and on the personal wealth and assets of senior Belarus officials. The U.S., said President Bush in his signing statement of October 20, 2004, \\"will work with our allies and partners to assist those seeking to return Belarus to its rightful place among the Euro-Atlantic community of democracies.\\" All three bills were introduced by Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey.https://www.c-span.org/video/?177388-2/house-session Earlier versions of the act that were introduced in 2001 and 2003 but not enacted into law were more severe, prohibiting travel of Belarusian officials, freezing assets, blocking certain trade, and referring to the role of Russia. Aftermath Spokesman Richard Boucher of the U.S. Department of State stated, according to an October 26, 2004 editorial in the Voice of America, that the U.S. was concerned about the Belarusian government's increasingly repressive steps against independent news media and pro-democracy groups. He further stated that Belarusian security forces used excessive force against peaceful protesters following the parliamentary elections and referendum. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and his government were highly displeased with the passage the act. On December 8, 2006, the United States House of Representatives passed, and (following Senate enactment) on January 12, 2007, President Bush signed into law, the Belarus Democracy Reauthorization Act of 2006, a statute amending and updating the act.

In 1967, Sveinson married Millie Prokopich. Sveinson was elected as a school trustee in Seine River in 1986, and re-elected in 1989. He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the general election of 1990, beating his nearest opponent by about 1000 votes in the rural southeastern riding of La Verendrye. Sveinson was re-elected in the 1995 election by about 2000 votes over his nearest opponent. He was never appointed to cabinet, though he did serve as Deputy Chair of Committees for a time. The Progressive Conservatives were defeated by the New Democratic Party in the 1999 provincial election. Sveinson was upset in La Verendrye, losing to NDP candidate Ron Lemieux by 166 votes. Sveinson did not seek a return to office in 2003. Following his defeat, Sveinson joined the real estate firm Century 21. He also joined the federal Progressive Conservative riding association executive in the riding of Provencher. In 2003, he led the executive in a unanimous vote against a political merger with the Canadian Alliance, and declared his support for Joe Clark's (ultimately unsuccessful) attempts to prevent the merger.

It, like most barium salts, is colorless, toxic, and water-soluble. It burns with a green flame and is an oxidizer; the compound is commonly used in pyrotechnics. Manufacture, occurrence, and reactions Barium nitrate is manufactured by two processes that start with the main source material for barium, the carbonate. The first involves dissolving barium carbonate in nitric acid, allowing any iron impurities to precipitate, then filtered, evaporated, and crystallized. The second requires combining barium sulfide with nitric acid. It occurs naturally as the very rare mineral nitrobarite.Mindat, http://www.mindat.org/min-2918.html At elevated temperatures, barium nitrate decomposes to barium oxide: : 2Ba(NO3)2 ‚Üí 2BaO + 4NO2 \\\\+ O2 Applications Barium nitrate is used in the production of BaO- containing materials. Military Although no longer produced, Baratol is an explosive composed of barium nitrate, TNT and binder; the high density of barium nitrate results in baratol being quite dense as well. Barium nitrate mixed with aluminium powder, a formula for flash powder, is highly explosive. It is mixed with thermite to form Thermate-TH3, used in military thermite grenades. Barium nitrate was also a primary ingredient in the \\"SR 365\\" incendiary charge used by the British in the De Wilde incendiary ammunition with which they armed their interceptor fighters, such as the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire, during the Battle of Britain. It is also used in the manufacturing process of barium oxide, the vacuum tube industry and for green fire in pyrotechnics. Safety Like all soluble barium compounds, barium nitrate is toxic by ingestion or inhalation.Barium Nitrate Solutions of sulfate salts such as Epsom salts or sodium sulfate may be given as first aid for barium poisoning, as they precipitate the barium as the insoluble (and non-toxic) barium sulfate. Inhalation may also cause irritation to the respiratory tract. While skin or eye contact is less harmful than ingestion or inhalation, it can still result in irritation, itching, redness, and pain. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set occupational exposure limits at 0.5 mg/m3 over an eight-hour time-weighted average.CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards References Category:Barium compounds Category:Nitrates Category:Nitrate minerals Category:Pyrotechnic oxidizers Category:Pyrotechnic colorants Category:Oxidizing agents ","title":"Barium nitrate"},{"id":"1112726","text":"Roda de Ter () is a municipality in the comarca of Osona, province of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, near Vic, on the Ter River above the Sau Reservoir.

The Virgin Mary, La Mare de D√©u del S√≤l del Pont is the patron of the village. On the site of an Iberian town a Roman villa was established. In its later fortified state it existed until 826, when was destroyed by Aiss√≥, in revolt against the Frankish count Bernat of Septimania. Many years passed before it was repopulated and grew slowly. The fierce independence of the mountain people of northern Catalonia manifested itself in banditry in which villagers were encouraged to participate, even by their silence, by a share in the takings. The bandit leaders might be peasants or local noblemen. On one occasion in 1646, the whole of the village of Roda de Ter was briefly incarcerated as fautors (\\"abettors\\") for their part in sheltering members of a local gang. The Catalan fighters against the French forces of the Bourbon Philip V of Spain are an easily overlooked local part of the European War of the Spanish Succession, but Roda was a hotbed of partisans for the unsuccessful Habsburg claimant. One of them, Francesc Maci√† i Ambert (died 1713), who came from Roda de Ter, is memorialized in Barcelona by a street and a metro station that bear his nom de guerre Bac de Roda. Before the comarca was called simply Roda; it took the name of Roda de Ter in late 20th century when the municipality was split into Roda de Ter (the town) and Masies de Roda (the rural zone). Roda de Ter lies on Catalan route C-153. The foundry Fundiciones de Roda produced fine cast iron components for hydraulics.

Tisza√∫jv√°ros owes its existence to the industrialization wave that took over the then- socialist Hungary after World War II. The government wanted to speed up industrial development and to create new job opportunities in the north- eastern part of the country. The town is one of the few Hungarian towns that do not have a history dating back to the Middle Ages or even earlier periods, although it was built near to an old village called Tiszaszederk√©ny (which was eventually annexed to the new town) and used the name Tiszaszederk√©ny until 1970. The construction of the town began on 9 September 1955; among the first buildings was a thermal power station and some blocks of flats around it. In the next stage of construction the Tiszai Vegyi Kombin√°t (TVK, \\"Chemical Factory\\") was built. It is one of the major chemical complexes in Hungary and, according to their website, represents more than 20% of petrochemical capacities in Central Europe. The first production unit, the paint factory started operating in 1961. Newer production units produce chemical fertilizers, polyethylene, and carbon black. An oil refinery was built too. The factories needed workers, so living quarters were needed in the town. By 1962 several houses were built, mainly using prisoner labor force, and shops and restaurants were opened as well. On 1 June 1961 the council of Tiszaszederk√©ny moved to the new town. The first stage of construction was over. During the second stage (1962‚Äì1965) more houses and shops were built. By 1966 there were 1,464 flats for the workers, and on 1 April 1966 the town was officially granted town status. Between 1966 and 1970 ‚Äì in the 3rd stage of town construction ‚Äì two primary schools, a secondary school and a community centre were built. The town was now inhabited by 10,000 people. On 22 April 1970 ‚Äì the 100th anniversary of Lenin's birth ‚Äì the town's name was changed to Leninv√°ros (Lenin Town). In the 1980s the town developed slower, but steadily. In 1989 the socialist regime ended in Hungary, and in 1991 the town's name was changed to Tisza√∫jv√°ros (literally: \\"Tisza new city\\", i.e., 'new city on the Tisza River'; another Hungarian industrial city, Szt√°linv√°ros ‚Äì Stalin City ‚Äì similarly changed its name to Duna√∫jv√°ros, \\"new city on the Danube\\" three decades earlier). During the 1990s the town developed fast, three churches and several new houses were built. One of the most popular tourist attractions is a thermal bath and water park with chutes.

Sanneh served as the Gambian Minister of Foreign Affairs from October 2004 to March 2005, and as the Gambian Ambassador to Senegal from November 2005 to February 2006. Early life and education Sanneh was born on 2 December 1947 in Bathurst, the only child of Morro Sanneh, a police inspector, and Aji Mallen Gaye. He was one of the first students to go through Gambia High School, beginning his studies there in 1959. He attended university in the United States, completing a bachelor's degree in economics and political science at Wilberforce University, Ohio. He then completed a master's degree in agricultural economics at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison before completing a diploma in urban management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a student, Sanneh campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy in his bid to become the Democratic nominee in the 1968 US Presidential election. Career Sanneh worked as an assistant to the Mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, before working as the city's Public Service Employment Administrator and later the Coordinator of the Community Development Block Grant for both the city of Madison and Dane County. He returned to the Gambia in 1977, following the death of his father, when he joined the Gambian civil service. His first role was in the Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development (MEPID), working under Dr Jabez Langley. From MEPID, he was seconded for three years to the Ministry of Agriculture to return the scandal-ridden Rural Development Project (RDP) to credibility. Following this, he returned to MEPID before transferring to the Ministry of Education. At the Ministry of Education he ran a project of investment into the education sector that culminated into what is now the University of the Gambia. In 1989, he was asked to move again, this time to the Ministry of Finance and Trade where he worked as a Deputy Permanent Secretary. In January 1992, he left government service to work as an Executive Director of the African Development Bank Group in Abidjan. He left the Bank in June 2001 when he became a Senior Advisor on Resource Mobilisation with the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Regional Bureau for Africa. He became the Gambian Minister of Foreign Affairs on 14 October 2004 and served in that position until 24 March 2005, when he was removed without explanation. When relations between the Gambia and Senegal turned sour later that year, Jammeh asked him to return but as the Gambian Ambassador to Senegal. He took this role on in November 2005, with concurrent accreditation for Burkina Faso and Mali, and presented his credentials to the Senegalese government in January 2006. One of the most pressing issues he had to deal with were negotiations over the Casamance conflict. In early February 2006, Sanneh received a call from a prominent Gambian parliamentarian and Jammeh appointee, warning him that Jammeh suspected him of working with the Gambian opposition. On 16 February, Sanneh received a call notifying that he had been relieved of his duty as an ambassador, but Sanneh insisted on a formal written notification. In March, a Gambian National Intelligence Agency (NIA) agent brought Sanneh the written notification, and informed him that he was to bring him back to Banjul, but Sanneh refused to leave. The Gambian government then granted him permission to remain in the embassy residence until his daughter's school year had ended. Following the end of his daughter's school year, Sanneh and his family moved to a hotel in Dakar. At the hotel, Sanneh and his family received threatening anonymous phone calls and noticed a large number of Gambian cars around the hotel and a large number of Gambians working in and staying in the hotel, causing them to fear for their lives. In August 2006, the US Embassy in Dakar requested authorization for Sanneh and his family to be taken in under the US Refugee Resettlement Program, writing that they considered \\"their lives to be in immediate danger\\". In January 2007, Sanneh returned to the United States, and in January 2008, he was made program Director at Dyncorp International in Falls Church, Virginia. He currently blogs about the Gambian government and is considered a \\"dissident\\".

It is the brothers' most popular and most widely translated novel outside the former Soviet Union. As of 2003, Boris Strugatsky has counted 55 publications of \\"Picnic\\" in 22 countries. The story is published in English in a translation by Antonina W. Bouis. A preface to the first American edition (MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1977) was written by Theodore Sturgeon. Stanislaw Lem wrote an afterword to the German edition of 1977. The 1979 film Stalker, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, is loosely based on the novel, with a screenplay written by the Strugatsky brothers. The term \\"stalker\\" became a part of the Russian language and according to the authors, became the most popular of their neologisms. In the book, a stalker is a person who breaks the prohibition, enters the Zone and takes out artifacts from it, which he sells as a living. In Russian, after Tarkovsky's film, the term acquired the meaning of a guide who navigates forbidden and uncharted territories; later on, fans of industrial tourism, especially those visiting abandoned sites and ghost towns, were also called stalkers. Plot introduction Roadside Picnic is a work of fiction based on the aftermath of an extraterrestrial event called the Visitation that simultaneously took place in half a dozen separate locations around Earth over a two-day period. Neither the Visitors themselves nor their means of arrival or departure were ever seen by the local populations who lived inside the relatively small areas, each a few square kilometers, of the six Visitation Zones. The zones exhibit strange and dangerous phenomena not understood by humans, and contain artifacts with inexplicable, seemingly supernatural properties. The title of the novel derives from an analogy proposed by the character Dr. Valentine Pilman, who compares the Visitation to a picnic: In this analogy, the nervous animals are the humans who venture forth after the Visitors have left, discovering items and anomalies that are ordinary to those who have discarded them, but incomprehensible or deadly to those who find them. This explanation implies that the Visitors may not have paid any attention to, or even noticed, the human inhabitants of the planet during their visit, just as humans do not notice or pay attention to grasshoppers or ladybugs during a picnic. The artifacts and phenomena left behind by the Visitors in the Zones were garbage, discarded and forgotten, without any preconceived plan to advance or damage humanity. There is little chance that the Visitors will return again because for them it was a brief stop, for reasons unknown, on the way to their actual destination. Plot  Background The novel is set in a post-visitation world where there are now six zones known on Earth that are full of unexplained phenomena and where strange happenings have briefly occurred, assumed to have been visitations by aliens. Governments and the UN, fearful of unforeseen consequences, try to keep tight control over them to prevent leakage of artifacts from the Zones. A subculture of stalkers, scavengers who go into the zones to steal the artifacts for profit, has evolved around the zones. The novel is set in and around a specific zone in Harmont, a fictitious town in a fictitious country (loosely resembling Canada), and follows the protagonist over the course of eight years. Introduction The introduction is a live radio interview with Dr. Pilman who is credited with the discovery that the six Visitation Zones' locations were not random. He explains it so: \\"Imagine that you spin a huge globe and you start firing bullets into it. The bullet holes would lie on the surface in a smooth curve. The whole point (is that) all six Visitation Zones are situated on the surface of our planet as though someone had taken six shots at Earth from a pistol located somewhere along the Earth‚ÄìDeneb line. Deneb is the alpha star in Cygnus.\\" Section 1 The story revolves around Redrick \\"Red\\" Schuhart, a tough and experienced young stalker who regularly enters the Zone illegally at night in search of valuable artifacts for profit. Trying to clean up his act, he becomes employed as a lab assistant at the International Institute, which studies the Zone. To help the career of his boss, whom he considers a friend, he goes into the Zone with him on an official expedition to recover a unique artifact (a full \\"empty\\"), which leads to his friend's death later on. This comes as a great shock when the news reaches Redrick, drunk in a bar, and he blames himself for his friend's fate. While Redrick is at the bar, a police force enters looking for stalkers. Redrick is forced to use a \\"shrieker\\" to make a hasty getaway. Red's girlfriend Guta is pregnant and decides to keep the baby no matter what. It is widely rumored that incursions into the Zone by stalkers carry high risk of mutations in their children, even though no radiation or other mutagens had been detected in the area. They decide to marry. Section 2 Disillusioned Redrick returns to stalking. In the course of his joint expedition into the Zone with a fellow stalker named Burbridge The Vulture, the latter steps into a substance known as \\"hell slime,\\" which slowly dissolves his leg bones. Amputation must be urgently performed in order to avoid to Burbridge losing his legs entirely. Redrick pulls Burbridge out of the Zone and drops him off at a surgeon, avoiding the patrols. Later on Redrick is confronted by Burbridge's daughter, who gets angry at him for saving her father. Guta has given birth to a happy and intelligent daughter, fully normal but for having short, light full body hair and black eyes. They lovingly call her the \\"Monkey\\". Redrick meets with his clients in a posh hotel, selling them a fresh portion of the Zone artifacts, but what they are really after is \\"hell slime\\". It is hinted that they want it for military research. Redrick claims he does not have it yet and leaves. Shortly afterward Redrick is arrested, but escapes. He then contacts his clients, telling them where he hid the \\"slime\\" sample that he had smuggled out previously. Redrick insists that all the proceeds from the sale be sent to Guta. He realizes that the \\"slime\\" will be used for some kind of weapon of mass destruction, but decides he has to provide for his family. He then gives himself up to the police. Section 3 Redrick's old friend Richard Noonan (a supply contractor with offices inside the Institute), is revealed as a covert operative of an unnamed, presumably governmental, secret organization working to stop the contraband outflow of artifacts from the Zone. Believing that he's nearing the successful completion of his multi-year assignment, he is confronted and scolded by his boss, who reveals to him that the flow is stronger than ever, and is tasked with finding who is responsible and how they operate. It is revealed that the stalkers are now organized under the cover of the \\"weekend picnics-for- tourists\\" business set up by Burbridge. They jokingly refer to the setup as \\"Sunday school\\". Noonan meets with Dr. Valentine Pilman for lunch and they have an in-depth discussion of the Visitation and humanity in general. This is where the idea of \\"Visitation as a roadside picnic\\" is articulated. Redrick is home again, having served his time. Burbridge visits him regularly, trying to entice him into some secret project, but Redrick declines. Guta is depressed because their daughter has nearly lost her humanity and ability to speak, more and more resembling an actual monkey. Redrick's dead father is also present, having had come home from the cemetery inside the Zone, as other very slowly- moving (and completely harmless) reanimated dead are now returning to their homes all around town. They are usually destroyed by the authorities as soon as they are discovered; Redrick, however, had forcibly managed to defend his father from being taken away. Section 4 Redrick goes into the Zone one last time in order to reach the wish-granting \\"Golden Sphere.\\" He has a map, given to him by Burbridge, whose son Arthur joins him on the expedition. Redrick knows one of them has to die in order to temporarily deactivate a phenomenon known as the \\"meatgrinder\\" in order for the other to reach the sphere, but he keeps this a secret from Arthur, whom he intends to sacrifice to it in order to make a wish to turn his daughter back to normal. After they get to the location, surviving many obstacles, Arthur rushes towards the sphere shouting out selfless wishes for a better world, only to be savagely dispatched by the meatgrinder. With the \\"Golden Sphere\\" in front of him, an exhausted Redrick looks back in confusion and bitterness on his whole life of desperate survival in a harsh world, his servitude and lack of free will, and finds that he cannot articulate what he actually wants from the sphere. After much unaccustomed introspection, Red at first leaves it to the Sphere to look into his untainted soul \\"to figure out\\" his wish, because \\"it can't be bad\\" but then despite his earlier contempt for Arthur's apparent naivety, he realizes he actually wants nothing other than the same thing the boy wanted: \\"HAPPINESS FOR EVERYBODY, FREE, AND MAY NO ONE BE LEFT BEHIND!\\" History The story was written by the Strugatsky brothers in 1971 (the first outlines were written January 18‚Äì27 in Leningrad, and the final version was completed between October 28 and November 3 in Komarovo).

Adaptations and cultural influence * A 1977 Czechoslovak TV miniseries N√°v≈°tƒõva z Vesm√≠ru (Visit from Space). After its TV premiere, all copies were destroyed by censors. * A 1979 science fiction film, Stalker, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, with a screenplay written by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, is loosely based on the novel. * While not a direct adaptation, the video game series S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is heavily influenced by Roadside Picnic. The first game in the series, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, references many important plot points from the book, such as the wish granter and the unknown force blocking the path to the center of the zone. It also contains elements such as anomalies and artifacts that are similar to those described in the book, but that are created by a supernatural ecological disaster, not by alien visitors. *The book is referenced in the post-apocalyptic video game Metro 2033. A character shuffles through a shelf of books in a ruined library and finds Roadside Picnic, he states that it is \\"something familiar\\". Metro 2033 was created by individuals who had worked on S.T.A.L.K.E.R. before founding their own video game development company. The game was based on a novel of the same name which also took influence from Roadside Picnic. * The 1992 video game Star Control II references alien visitations with mysterious effects and the mosquito mange regarding the disappearance of the Androsynth. * In 2003, the Finnish theater company Circus Maximus produced a stage version of Roadside Picnic, called Stalker. Authorship of the play was credited to the Strugatskys and to Mikko Viljanen and Mikko Kanninen. * A tabletop role-playing game in 2012 titled Stalker was developed by Ville Vuorela of Burger Games. * M. John Harrison's novel Nova Swing (2007), which features a location called the 'Event Zone' where reality is skewed in various ways, can be seen to be influenced by Roadside Picnic. * A Finnish low-budget indie film Vy√∂hyke (Zone), directed by Esa Luttinen, was released in 2012. The film is set in a Finnish visitation zone, and refers to material in the novel as well as the Tarkovsky film. * British progressive rock band Guapo's 2013 album History of the Visitation, is based on the novel. * In 2016, the US TV channel WGN America ordered a pilot for a TV adaptation, starring Matthew Goode and directed by Alan Taylor, but did not proceed to a series order. * The 2016 video game The Final Station is partly based on the book, in which an alien \\"Visitation\\" occurred across several countries in the game. The Visitation devastated human society but also left some advanced technology to humanity. * The documentary HyperNormalisation by Adam Curtis discusses the book and its role in questioning the realism of Soviet society. *Japanese writer Iori Miyazawa's 2017 Ura Sekai Picnic (Otherside Picnic) is a light novel and manga series in which two girls explore the \\"Otherside\\", a world of urban legend populated by ghosts of folklore. * Annihilation, a 2018 science fiction psychological horror film, written and directed by Alex Garland, though based on the eponymous novel by Jeff VanderMeer, for some critics betrays obvious similarities with the Roadside Picnic and Stalker.

These plans may be set up by employers, insurance companies, trade unions, the government, or other institutions. Congress has expressed a desire to encourage responsible retirement planning by granting favorable tax treatment to a wide variety of plans. Federal tax aspects of retirement plans in the United States are based on provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the plans are regulated by the Department of Labor under the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Types of retirement plans Retirement plans are classified as either defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans, depending on how benefits are determined. In a defined benefit (or pension) plan, benefits are calculated using a fixed formula that typically factors in final pay and service with an employer, and payments are made from a trust fund specifically dedicated to the plan. Separate accounts for each participant do not exist. By contrast, in a defined contribution plan, each participant has an account, and the benefit for the participant is dependent upon both the amount of money contributed into the account and the performance of the investments purchased with the funds contributed to the account. Some types of retirement plans, such as cash balance plans, combine features of both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. Defined contribution plans According to Internal Revenue Code Section 414, a defined contribution plan is an employer-sponsored plan with an individual account for each participant. The accrued benefit from such a plan is solely attributable to contributions made into an individual account and investment gains on those funds, less any losses and expense charges. The contributions are invested (e.g., in the stock market), and the returns on the investment are credited to or deducted from the individual's account. Upon retirement, the participant's account is used to provide retirement benefits, often through the purchase of an annuity. Defined contribution plans have become more widespread over recent years and are now the dominant form of plan in the private sector. The number of defined benefit plans in the U.S. has been steadily declining, as more employers see pension funding as a financial risk they can avoid by freezing the plan and instead offering a defined contribution plan. Examples of defined contribution plans include individual retirement account (IRA), 401(k), and profit sharing plans. In such plans, the participant is responsible for selecting the types of investments toward which the funds in the retirement plan are allocated. This may range from choosing one of a small number of pre-determined mutual funds to selecting individual stocks or other securities. Most self-directed retirement plans are characterized by certain tax advantages. The funds in such plans may not be withdrawn without penalty until the investor reaches retirement age, which is typically the year in which taxpayer reaches 59.5 years of age. Money contributed can be from employee salary deferrals, employer contributions, or employer matching contributions. Defined contribution plans are subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 415 limits on how much can be contributed. As of 2015, the total deferral amount including the employee and employer contribution is capped at $53,000. The employee-only amount is $18,000 for 2015, but a plan can permit participants who are age 50 or older to make \\"catch-up\\" contributions of up to an additional $6,000. Defined benefit plans Commonly referred to as a pension in the US, a defined benefit plan pays benefits from a trust fund using a specific formula set forth by the plan sponsor. In other words, the plan defines a benefit that will be paid upon retirement. The statutory definition of defined benefit encompasses all pension plans that are not defined contribution and therefore do not have individual accounts. While this catch-all definition has been interpreted by the courts to capture some hybrid pension plans like cash balance (CB) plans and pension equity plans (PEP), most pension plans offered by large businesses or government agencies are final average pay (FAP) plans, under which the monthly benefit is equal to the number of years worked multiplied by the member's salary at retirement multiplied by a factor known as the accrual rate. At a minimum, benefits are payable in normal form as a Single Life Annuity (SLA) for single participants or as a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (QJSA) for married participants. Both normal forms are paid at Normal Retirement Age (usually 65) and may be actuarially adjusted for early or late commencement. Other optional forms of payment, such as lump sum distributions, may be available but are not required. The cash balance plan typically offers a lump sum at and often before normal retirement age. However, as is the case with all defined benefit plans, a cash balance plan must also provide the option of receiving the benefit as a life annuity. The amount of the annuity benefit must be definitely determinable as per IRS regulation 1.412-1. Defined benefit plans may be either funded or unfunded. In a funded plan, contributions from the employer and participants are invested into a trust fund dedicated solely to paying benefits to retirees under a given plan. The future returns on the investments and the future benefits to be paid are not known in advance, so there is no guarantee that a given level of contributions will meet future obligations. Therefore, fund assets and liabilities are regularly reviewed by an actuary in a process known as valuation. A defined benefit plan is required to maintain adequate funding if it is to remain qualified. In an unfunded plan, no funds are set aside for the specific purpose of paying benefits. The benefits to be paid are met immediately by contributions to the plan or by general assets. Most government-run retirement plans, including Social Security, are unfunded, with benefits being paid directly out of current taxes and Social Security contributions. Most nonqualified plans are also unfunded. Hybrid and cash balance plans Hybrid plan designs combine the features of defined benefit and defined contribution plan designs. In general, they are treated as defined benefit plans for tax, accounting, and regulatory purposes. As with defined benefit plans, investment risk is largely borne by the plan sponsor. As with defined contribution designs, plan benefits are expressed in the terms of a notional account balance, and are usually paid as cash balances upon termination of employment. These features make them more portable than traditional defined benefit plans and perhaps more attractive to a highly mobile workforce. A typical hybrid design is the cash balance plan, where the employee's notional account balance grows by some defined rate of interest and annual employer contribution. In the United States, conversions from traditional plan to hybrid plan designs have been controversial. Upon conversion, plan sponsors are required to retrospectively calculate employee account balances, and if the employee's actual vested benefit under the old design is more than the account balance, the employee enters a period of wear away. During this period, the employee would be eligible to receive the already accrued benefit under the old formula, but all future benefits are accrued under the new plan design. Eventually, the accrued benefit under the new design exceeds the grandfathered amount under the old design. To the participant, however, it appears as if there is a period where no new benefits are accrued. Hybrid designs also typically eliminate the more generous early retirement provisions of traditional pensions. Because younger workers have more years in which to accrue interest and pay credits than those approaching retirement age, critics of cash balance plans have called the new designs discriminatory. On the other hand, the new designs may better meet the needs of a modern workforce and actually encourage older workers to remain at work, since benefit accruals continue at a constant pace as long as an employee remains on the job. As of 2008, the courts have generally rejected the notion that cash balance plans discriminate based on age, while the Pension Protection Act of 2006 offers relief for most hybrid plans on a prospective basis. Although a cash balance plan is technically a defined benefit plan designed to allow workers to evaluate the economic worth their pension benefit in the manner of a defined contribution plan (i.e., as an account balance), the target benefit plan is a defined contribution plan designed to express its projected impact in terms of lifetime income as a percent of final salary at retirement (i.e., as an annuity amount). For example, a target benefit plan may mimic a typical defined benefit plan offering 1.5% of salary per year of service times the final 3-year average salary. Actuarial assumptions like 5% interest, 3% salary increases and the UP84 Life Table for mortality are used to calculate a level contribution rate that would create the needed lump sum at retirement age. The problem with such plans is that the flat rate could be low for young entrants and high for old entrants. While this may appear unfair, the skewing of benefits to the old worker is a feature of most traditional defined benefit plans, and any attempt to match it would reveal this backloading feature. Requirement of permanence To guard against tax abuse in the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has promulgated rules that require that pension plans be permanent as opposed to a temporary arrangement used to capture tax benefits. Regulation 1.401-1(b)(2) states that \\"[t]hus, although the employer may reserve the right to change or terminate the plan, and to discontinue contributions thereunder, the abandonment of the plan for any reason other than business necessity within a few years after it has taken effect will be evidence that the plan from its inception was not a bona fide program for the exclusive benefit of employees in general. Especially will this be true if, for example, a pension plan is abandoned soon after pensions have been fully funded for persons in favor of whom discrimination is prohibited...\\" The IRS would have grounds to disqualify the plan retroactively, even if the plan sponsor initially got a favorable determination letter. Qualified retirement plans Qualified plans receive favorable tax treatment and are regulated by ERISA. The technical definition of qualified does not agree with the commonly used distinction. For example, 403(b) plans are not considered qualified plans, but are treated and taxed almost identically. The term qualified has special meaning regarding defined benefit plans. The IRS defines strict requirements a plan must meet in order to receive favorable tax treatment, including: * A plan must offer life annuities in the form of a Single Life Annuity (SLA) and a Qualified Joint & Survivor Annuity (QJSA). * A plan must maintain sufficient funding levels. * A plan must be administered according to the plan document. * Benefits are required to commence at retirement age (usually age 65 if no longer working, or age 70 1/2 if still employed). * Once earned, benefits may not be forfeited. * A plan may not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. * A plan must be insured by the PBGC. Failure to meet IRS requirements can lead to plan disqualification, which carries with it enormous tax consequences. SIMPLE IRAs A SIMPLE IRA is a type of Individual Retirement Account (IRA) that is provided by an employer. It is similar to a 401(k) but offers simpler and less costly administration rules. Like a 401(k) plan, the SIMPLE IRA is funded by a pre-tax salary reduction. However, contribution limits for SIMPLE plans are lower than for most other types of employer-provided retirement plans. SEP IRAs A Simplified Employee Pension Individual Retirement Account, or SEP IRA, is a variation of the Individual Retirement Account. SEP IRAs are adopted by business owners to provide retirement benefits for the business owners and their employees. There are no significant administration costs for self-employed person with no employees. If the self-employed person does have employees, all employees must receive the same benefits under a SEP plan. Because SEP accounts are treated as IRAs, funds can be invested the same way as is the case for any other IRA. Keogh or HR10 plans Keogh plans are full-fledged pension plans for the self-employed. Named for U.S. Representative Eugene James Keogh of New York, they are sometimes called HR10 plans. Nonqualified plans Plans that do not meet the guidelines required to receive favorable tax treatment are considered nonqualified and are exempt from the restrictions placed on qualified plans. They are typically used to provide additional benefits to key or highly paid employees, such as executives and officers. Examples include SERP (Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans) and 457(f) plans. Contrasting types of retirement plans Advocates of Defined contribution plan point out that each employee has the ability to tailor the investment portfolio to his or her individual needs and financial situation, including the choice of how much to contribute, if anything at all. However, others state that these apparent advantages could also hinder some workers who might not possess the financial savvy to choose the correct investment vehicles or have the discipline to voluntarily contribute money to retirement accounts. Portability and valuation Defined contribution plans have actual balances of which workers can know the value with certainty by simply checking the record of the balance. There is no legal requirement that the employer allow the former worker take his money out to roll over into an IRA, though it is relatively uncommon in the U.S. not to allow this (and many companies such as Fidelity run numerous TV ads encouraging individuals to transfer their old plans into current ones). Because the lump sum actuarial present value of a former worker's vested accrued benefit is uncertain, the IRS, under section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, specifies the interest and mortality figures that must be used. This has caused some employers as in the Berger versus Xerox case in the 7th Circuit (Richard A. Posner was the judge who wrote the opinion) with cash balance plans to have a higher liability for employers for a lump sum than was in the employee's \\"notional\\" or \\"hypothetical\\" account balance. When the interest credit rate exceeds the mandated section 417(e) discounting rate, the legally mandated lump sum value payable to the employee [if the plan sponsor allows for pre-retirement lump sums] would exceed the notional balance in the employee's cash balance account. This has been colourfully dubbed the \\"Whipsaw\\" in actuarial parlance. The Pension Protection Act signed into law on August 17, 2006 contained added provisions for these types of plans allowing the distribution of the cash balance account as a lump sum. Portability: practical difference, not a legal difference A practical difference is that a defined contribution plan's assets generally remain with the employee (generally, amounts contributed by the employee and earnings on them remain with the employee, but employer contributions and earnings on them do not vest with the employee until a specified period has elapsed), even if he or she transfers to a new job or decides to retire early. By contrast, in many countries defined benefit pension benefits are typically lost if the worker fails to serve the requisite number of years with the same company. Self-directed accounts from one employer may usually be 'rolled-over' to another employer's account or converted from one type of account to another in these cases. Because defined contribution plans have actual balances, employers can simply write a check because the amount of their liability at termination of employment which may be decades before actual normal (65) retirement date of the plan is known with certainty. There is no legal requirement that the employer allow the former worker take his money out to roll over into an IRA, though it is relatively uncommon in the US not to allow this. Just as there is no legal requirement to give portability to a Defined contribution plan, there is no mandated ban on portability for defined benefit plans. However, because the lump sum actuarial present value of a former worker's vested accrued benefit is uncertain, the mandate under in section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code specifies the interest and mortality figures that must be used. This uncertainty has limited the practical portability of defined benefit plans. Investment risk borne by employee or employer It is commonly said that the employee bears investment risk for defined contribution plans, while the employer bears that risk in defined benefit plans. This is true for practically all cases, but pension law in the United States does not require that employees bear investment risk. The law only provides a section 404(c) exemption under ERISA from fiduciary liability if the employer provides the mandated investment choices and gives employees sufficient control to customize his pension investment portfolio appropriate to his risk tolerance. PBGC insurance: a legal difference ERISA does not provide insurance from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) for defined contribution plans, but cash balance plans do get such insurance because they, like all ERISA-defined benefit plans, are covered by the PBGC. Plans may also be either employer-provided or individual plans. Most types of retirement plans are employer-provided, though individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are very common. Tax advantages Most retirement plans (the exception being most non qualified plans) offer significant tax advantages. Most commonly the money contributed to the account is not taxed as income to the employee at the time of the contribution. In the case of employer provided plans, however, the employer is able to receive a tax deduction for the amount contributed as if it were regular employee compensation. This is known as pre-tax contributions, and the amounts allowed to be contributed vary significantly among various plan types. The other significant advantage is that the assets in the plan are allowed to grow through investing without the taxpayer being taxed on the annual growth year by year. Once the money is withdrawn it is taxed fully as income for the year of the withdrawal. There are many restrictions on contributions, especially with 401(k) and defined benefit plans. The restrictions are designed to make sure that highly compensated employees do not gain too much tax advantage at the expense of lesser paid employees. Currently two types of plan, the Roth IRA and the Roth 401(k), offer tax advantages that are essentially reversed from most retirement plans. Contributions to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s must be made with money that has been taxed as income. After meeting the various restrictions, withdrawals from the account are received by the taxpayer tax- free. EGTRRA and later changes The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) brought significant changes to retirement plans, generally easing restrictions on the ability of the taxpayer to roll money from one type of account to the other, and increasing contributions limits. Most of the changes were designed to phase in over a period of 4 to 10 years.

Williams in the 1936 Plaid Cymru pamphlet Coelcerth Rhyddid David John Williams (26 June 1885 - 4 January 1970) was one of the foremost Welsh- language writers of the twentieth century and a prominent Welsh nationalist. He died in 1970 in Rhydcymerau, Carmarthenshire, Wales.  Life  Williams was born Penrhiw, Llansawel, Carmarthenshire, moving with his family to a smaller farm, Abernant, near Rhydcymerau in 1891. He left home in 1902 and spent four years working in the south Wales coalfield. He resumed his studies, eventually studying English at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth and Jesus College, Oxford. At Oxford he was befriended with Flora Forster, and she declined his offers to marry him. For most of his life he taught English at the grammar school in Fishguard (now Ysgol Bro Gwaun), Pembrokeshire.  Politics  A socialist, he was one of the founders of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh National Party, in 1925. He took part, with Saunders Lewis and Lewis Valentine, in the symbolic burning of a bombing school in Penyberth in north- west Wales in 1936. He spent nine months in Wormwood Scrubs prison.  Literary Career  Williams was a short story writer of renown and also the author of two volumes of autobiography.

The latest stable version 1.4.23-svn is tested with PHP up to version 7.3 and replaces version 1.4.22 which can only run on PHP version 5.0-5.4. The svn part in the version name points out that bugfixes and minor improvements are no longer published as new versions, but instead are maintained within Apache Subversion version control system.  History  The webmail portion of the project was started by Nathan and Luke Ehresman in 1999 and is written in PHP. SquirrelMail can be employed in conjunction with a LAMP \\"stack\\", and any other operating systems that support PHP are supported as well. The web server needs access to the IMAP server hosting the email and to an SMTP server to be able to send mails. SquirrelMail webmail outputs valid HTML 4.0 for its presentation, making it compatible with a majority of current web browsers. SquirrelMail webmail uses a plugin architecture to accommodate additional features around the core application, and over 200 plugins are available on the SquirrelMail website. The SquirrelMail IMAP proxy server product was created in 2002 by Dave McMurtrie while at the University of Pittsburgh (where it was named \\"up-imapproxy\\", although it has become more commonly known as \\"imapproxy\\") and adopted by the SquirrelMail team in 2010. It is written in C and is primarily made to provide stateful connections for stateless webmail client software to an IMAP server, thus avoiding new IMAP logins for every client action and in some cases significantly improving webmail performance. Both SquirrelMail products are free and open-source software subject to the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2. SquirrelMail webmail was included in the repositories of many major GNU/Linux distributions and is independently downloaded by thousands of people every month. Platforms SquirrelMail webmail is available for any platform supporting PHP. Most commonly used platforms include Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and the server variants of Microsoft Windows. SquirrelMail IMAP Proxy compiles on most flavors of Unix, and can generally be used on the same platforms that the webmail product can with the exception of Microsoft Windows, unless used in a Cygwin or similar environment. Apple shipped SquirrelMail as their supported web mail solution in Mac OS X Server. Plugins The SquirrelMail webmail client itself is a complete webmail system, but extra features are available in the form of plugins. There are over 200 third-party plugins available for download from the SquirrelMail website and SquirrelMail ships with several \\"standard\\" or \\"core\\" plugins. Internationalization SquirrelMail webmail has been translated into over 50 languages including Arabic, Chinese, French, German, and Spanish. Notable installations SquirrelMail has been implemented as the official email system of the Prime Minister's Office of the Republic of India for its security advantages over Microsoft's Outlook Express.

Since 1972, Greetsiel has been part of the municipality of Krummh√∂rn, which has its administrative seat in Pewsum. The nearest railway station is at Emden, about away, and the two towns are linked by a bus service. Although originally just a small but picturesque fishing village, Greetsiel has become a major tourist attraction. In December 2006, it had 1,534 inhabitants, but the number of people living in the village significantly increases during the summer months and over the Christmas holidays.  Geography  Greetsiel is situated on the Leybucht, a small bay on the East Frisian coast. Over time, large parts of the bay were reclaimed behind dykes, so that Greetsiel is the only port in the bay today. In the 1990s, the Leybuchth√∂rn was completed. This structure extends as a spit out into the Wadden Sea. Within the Leybuchth√∂rn is a reservoir and the approach channel from the North Sea into Greetsiel Harbour (Greetsieler Hafen). Between the port and the open sea is a lock. Since the completion of the structure, Greetsiel Harbour has been accessible from the sea, irrespective of the tide. The distance to the nearest towns of Emden and Norden is to the north and south respectively.  History  Greetsiel is first mentioned in the records in letters dating to the year 1388 (Ocko I tom Brok). At that time, Hamburg's ships lay at anchor in the port of Greetsiel and had to pay tariffs. The place was founded by the Domain of Appingen under the chiefs of Cirksena. While Appingen increasingly lost its importance, Greetsiel became the seat of the chief. In 1462 Count Edzard the Great was born at the Cirksenaburg; under his rule East Frisia extended from the River Weser as far as Groningen. In 1547 Ubbo Emmius was born here. On old Dutch maps the town is marked as Grietjezijl. In creating the municipality of Krummh√∂rn in 1972, a debate erupted over whether the administrative headquarters should be Pewsum or Greetsiel. Because Greetsiel was a more isolated location, Pewsum was preferred.  Culture and points of interest   Buildings  Of all the East Frisian Siel villages (a Siel is a sluice in a dyke), Greetsiel has the best preserved old fishermen's cottages. In its picturesque fishing harbour there are still 28 shrimp cutters (Krabbenkutter). Other notable buildings are: *Greetsiel Church, an Evangelical Reformed church. The rectangular, brick, aisleless church (Saalkirche) was built between 1380 and 1410 as the private church of the chief, Haro Edzardsna, in two stages. In 1401, long before its final completion, it was to be consecrated to Saint Mary. The building is crowned by a small fl√®che (Dachreiter) decorated with a clock. This is adorned by a 1730 weather vane in the shape of a ship. The actual clock tower stands off to one side. The simple interior, which at one time had a flat ceiling, has been covered by a slightly vaulted wooden ceiling since 1852. The organ was completely renovated in 1963, but its case is from 1738; the pulpit, however, had already been made in 1669. *Steinhaus, the former seat of the Cirksena family. The brick building at the end of the high street (Hohe Stra√üe) was built about 1600 on the foundations of a previous building erected around 1390. In the interior the original hall has been restored in the course of renovation work. *Houses. Among the most famous photographic motifs in Greetsiel is the row of houses on Sielstra√üe flanking the harbour. The houses at No. 11 and No. 15, with their bell-shaped gables based on Dutch designs, are particularly striking. While the former is dated 1741, No. 15 was built in 1792. The Poppingas Old Bakery (Poppingas Alte B√§ckerei), No. 21, from the 19th century is also found on Sielstra√üe and is used now as a museum, cafe and gallery; its interior has been preserved unchanged. Near the church is the so-called High House (Hohes Haus) at 1, Hohe Stra√üe, a two-storey, sideways-on, brick building, which once served as the seat of the treasurer or Rentmeister. According to the anchor plate on the gable it dates to \\"1696\\", but is thought to have already been in decline by the middle of the 16th century. Today the building, whose street fa√ßade is covered with an ashlar facing, houses a hotel. The Amtmannshaus on Neuer Deich is probably from the same period, but was extensively renovated during the 19th century. In the latest renovation the exterior appearance of the house and its associated Gulf barn was changed significantly by the addition of modern dormers. In M√ºhlenstra√üe is Haus von Halem, built in 1794 and one of the most important residential examples of neoclassical architecture in East Frisia. The two-storey brick building with a hip roof is divided by a huge pilasters. The portal has a richly carved fanlights in the late rococo style.  Windmills  thumb The twin windmills () of Greetsiel-West date from 1856 (green) and Greetsiel-Ost from 1706 (red, renovated in 1921 with parts of Aurich's Wallm√ºhle mill of 1750). They are smock mills ().  Other places of interest  Other places of interest include the scoop wheel, the old Siel (1798), the new Siel (1887) and the Pilsum Lighthouse. Greetsiel also hosts the largest ship in a bottle museum in Germany and Europe, with about 800 examples.greetsiel.de: Museumshaus , accessed on 2 June 2011. Of all the places in the municipality of Krummh√∂rn, Greetsiel has the highest influx of tourists.  Regular events  An annual painting and art exhibition, known as Greetsiel Week (Greetsieler Woche), is of national prominence. It has been running for more than 30 years and exhibits a range of works including: art, ceramics, goldsmiths' products and sculptures. Every two years, the Imke Folkerts Prize for Fine Arts, worth 10,000 euros, is awarded at the event.Imke Folkerts Prize for Fine Arts, accessed on 6 January 2013. Qualifying entries include works in the fields of art, graphics, photography and sculpture. There are also regular exhibitions in Greetsiel's twin windmills. Every year in mid- summer is the boat parade in which the majority of Greetsiel's cutters take part. The crews take guests on a roughly four-hour boat trip. The port also hosts a supporting programme of events with music and shrimp-shelling competitions.greetsiel.de: Kutterkorso , accessed on 2 June 2011  Transport  Former railway station buildings Greetsiel is linked by state roads to Norden and Emden and from there the A 31. At one time the Emden-Pewsum- Greetsiel light railway linked Pewsum and Greetsiel with Emden. The operation of the gauge railway began in 1899 between Emden and Pewsum and, in 1906, the line was extended to Greetsiel. Kleinbahnstra√üe in Greetsiel recalls that period, along which there are still several railway buildings that are now used for other purposes. The narrow-gauge railway was closed in 1963; since when passenger services have been taken over by buses. Today, Greetsiel is connected by bus with the former county town of Norden as well as Emden. Greetsiel can also be reached by smaller boats from the direction of Emden. The Alte Greetsieler Sieltief and the Neue Greetsieler Sieltief connect the port with the East Frisian inland waterways network.

In addition to making red varietal wines, Mourv√®dre is a prominent component in \\"GSM\\" (Grenache, Syrah, and Mourv√®dre) blends. The variety is also used to make ros√© and port-style fortified wines.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pp. 459-460 Oxford University Press 2006 Mourv√®dre tends to produce tannic wines that can be high in alcohol. The style of wine produced from the grapes varies greatly according to where it is produced, but according to wine expert Jancis Robinson Mourv√®dre wines often have wild game, or earthy notes to them, with soft red fruit flavors.Robinson, Jancis Vines, Grapes & Wines Mitchell Beazley 1986 According to wine expert Oz Clarke, young Mourv√®dre can come across as faulted due to the reductive, sulfur notes and \\"farmyard-y\\" flavors that some wines can exhibit before those flavors mellow with age.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 140-141 Harcourt Books 2001 The variety can be a difficult grape to grow, preferring \\"its face in the hot sun and its feet in the water\\" meaning that it needs very warm weather, a low leaf-to-fruit ratio but adequate water or irrigation to produce intensely flavored fruit that is not overly jammy or herbaceous. The vines' susceptibility to many viticultural hazards such as powdery and downy mildew as well as overly vigorous foliage can present additional problems for vine growers. History Mourv√®dre from an early 20th-century ampelography text Most wine historians agree that Mourv√®dre is likely to be Spanish in origin, though its exact history is difficult to pinpoint. The variety was probably introduced to Valencia by the Phoenicians around 500 BC. The French-adapted name Mourv√®dre probably came from Murviedro (Mourv√®dre in Valenciano, nowadays Sagunt) near Valencia while the name Mataro is thought to have come from Matar√≥, Catalonia near the modern-day city of Barcelona. Despite this close association with Murviedro and Matar√≥, the grape became known in Spain as Monastrell for reasons that are still unknown though Oz Clarke speculates that a \\"neutral\\" name may have been chosen so as not to offend the local pride of both regions. Mourv√®dre had a well-established presence in Roussillon region of France by at least the 16th century when still part of Spain (until 1659) where it spread eastwards towards Provence and the Rhone. There it had a well established foothold until the phylloxera epidemic of the mid to late 19th century decimated plantings. As the French and other European wine regions recovered from the phylloxera scourge by grafting Vitis vinifera varieties to American rootstock, it was discovered that Mourv√®dre vines did not take well to the grafting and many vineyards were replanted with other varieties.Tablas Creek Vineyard \\"About Mourv√®dre:\\" Grape Variety Guide. Accessed: July 2nd, 2012 Mourv√®dre arrived in California in the 1860s as part of the Pellier collection. The variety, known as Mataro, was used primarily for bulk produced jug wines. In the late 20th century, interest in Mourv√®dre as a premium grape variety picked up as the Rhone Rangers began seeking out old vine plantings of the variety in Contra Costa County vineyards. In the 1990s, critically acclaimed bottlings from Bonny Doon Vineyard and Cline Cellars Winery promoted demand in the variety and by the mid-2000s, plantings of Mourv√®dre in California had risen to 260 ha (650 acres). In Australia, the variety (known there as Mataro) has had a long history in the country with plantings dating back to the mid-19th century. In the 1980s, many of these old vine plantings were uprooted in a government sponsored vine pulling scheme but some still survive and are producing today. While historically the variety was used mainly as an anonymous blending grape in fortified wines, the variety saw a rise in interest in the 1990s as producers started receiving acclaim for GSM (Grenache, Syrah, and Mourv√®dre) blends (many from the surviving, low yield old vine plantings). With a slight increase in planting there were more than 1000 ha of Mataro in Australia by the mid-2000s. It has been put forward by Ampelographists that Mourv√®dre may be the parent to the esteemed grape Mavrud, or that at least Mavrud is a clone of Mourv√®dre, imported into Bulgaria by the Romans. Viticulture According to ampelographer Pierre Galet Mourv√®dre thrives in warm climates as the variety has a tendency to both bud and ripen very late. While the variety can recover well from late spring frost due to the late budding, it can be very temperature sensitive throughout its growing season with even low winter temperatures affecting its dormancy. Though the grape can adapt to a variety of vineyard soil types, the most ideal sites are very warm, south facing (Northern hemisphere) slopes with shallow, clay soils that can retain the necessary moisture to keep the vines \\"feet\\" wet without letting it grow its foliage too vigorously. In addition to a warm climate, Mourv√®dre also does best in a dry climate with sufficient wind to protect it from the viticultural hazards of powdery mildew and downy mildew. Mourv√®dre leaf. The grape clusters of Mourv√®dre are relatively compact, enhancing its susceptibility to mildew, with small thick-skinned berries that are high in both color and flavor phenolics, particularly tannins. Even though the variety ripens late, it has the potential to ripen to high Brix sugar levels which can translate into a high alcohol level during fermentation. The vine can also be very vigorous, producing abundant foliage that can shade the grape clusters, affecting canopy management decisions for growers. In Australia and California, many of the oldest plantings of Mourv√®dre are bush trained as the vines grows well vertically but the variety can be grown under many different kinds of vine training systems. The harvest window for the grape tends to be very short once it reaches peak ripeness, with acidity rapidly falling and the grapes soon desiccating and developing \\"prune-y\\" flavors. One advantage of the thick skins is that Mourv√®dre can withstand late harvest rains without the berries swelling and bursting like thinner skin varieties such as Grenache. In regions such as the Paso Robles AVA of California, it is often one of the last varieties to be harvested sometimes hanging onto the vine until early November. Mourv√®dre produces medium-size, compact bunches that are usually conical in shape with a small wing cluster that may be discarded during green harvesting. The leaves often have truncate cuneiform \\"wedge\\" shape. Since World War II, newer clones and better rootstock have been developed that have allowed Mourv√®dre vines to be grafted more easily. Today many plantings of Mourv√®dre are to 110R and 41B rootstocks. Wine regions A ros√© Bandol wine from Provence made mostly from Mourv√®dre. Spain In Spain, Mourv√®dre is called Monastrell and was the fourth most widely planted red wine grape variety with in 2015. Like many other Spanish varieties, its numbers have been declining in recent years (in 1996 there was over 100,000 ha/250,000 of the vine planted in SpainJ. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 115-116 Oxford University Press 1996 ) as growers pull up older plantings and replant them with popular international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. However, the variety still has a strong hold in eastern Spain where it is widely planted in several Spanish wine regions around Murcia and the Valencian Community. Under Spanish wine law, Monastrell is one of the primary red wine grape varieties in the DOPs of Jumilla, Yecla, Valencia, Almansa, and Alicante. Other Spanish DOPs where Monastrell is a permitted variety include Binissalem-Mallorca and Pl√† i Llevant in the Balearic Islands, Bullas, Catalunya, Cari√±ena, Costers del Segre, Manchuela, Pened√®s and Ribera del Guadiana. Monastrell is also permitted in the sparkling wine Cava though it is rarely used.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 230-241 Firefly Books 2004 France In France, Mourv√®dre doesn't grow much farther north than the Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape AOC in the southern Rh√¥ne; and even there it has some trouble ripening in cooler vintages. It tends to ripen most consistently in the warmer Proven√ßal region of Bandol AOC along the Mediterranean coast where the growing season is often 5 ¬∞C warmer. While plantings have been declining in Spain, they have been increasing in France, particularly in the Languedoc- Roussillon region where the grape variety has seen growing popularity as both a varietal wine and as a blending component. After the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century and with declining interest in the variety for most of the 20th century, there were less than 900 ha in 1968, mostly in the southern Rh√¥ne and the Bandol AOC of Provence. But the spark of interest and international investment in the Languedoc saw planting sharply increase and by 2000 there were over 7,600 ha of Mourv√®dre planted throughout Southern France. A Mourv√®dre from the Horse Heaven Hills AVA in Washington State. While Bandol is the AOC region that most prominently features Mourv√®dre (by law all red Bandols must contain at least 50% Mourv√®dre), other Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC)s that has Mourv√®dre as a permitted variety include Cassis, Collioure, Corbi√®res, Costi√®res de N√Æmes, Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence, Coteaux du Languedoc, Coteaux de Pierrevert, Coteaux Varois, C√¥tes du Luberon, Coteaux du Tricastin, C√¥tes de Provence, C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne, C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne Villages, C√¥tes du Roussillon, C√¥tes du Roussillon Villages, C√¥tes du Ventoux, Faug√®res, Fitou, Palette, Saint-Chinian, Gigondas, Lirac, Minervois and Vacqueyras.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 37-109 Firefly Books 2004 In Ch√¢teauneuf-du- Pape it is one of the 18 permitted varieties in the red wine but is often a secondary component behind Grenache and Syrah. The exceptions are notable blends from producers such as Ch√¢teau de Beaucastel which often has Mourv√®dre account for more than a third of the blend. As of 2009, Mourv√®dre accounted for 6.6% (213 ha) of all Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape plantings.H. Karis The Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape Wine Book pg 76 Kavino Publishing (2009)  New World  In the United States, Mourv√®dre is found primarily in California and Washington State with some limited plantings in Arizona, Missouri, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas and Virginia. In the US, the style of Mourv√®dre tends to be less tannic than Old World examples such as Bandols. In Washington State, the grape was first planted at Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA in 1983. The 1990s and 2000s saw an increase of plantings of the variety, most notably at Alder Ridge Vineyard and Destiny Ridge Vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills AVA and Ciel du Cheval Vineyard in the Red Mountain AVA. In Washington, the grape is used in both varietal and Rhone-style blends where it provides a medium body structure with cherry fruit flavors as well smokey, spicy and gamy notes.P. Gregutt \\"Washington Wines and Wineries: The Essential Guide\\" pg 72 University of California Press 2007 Mourv√®dre/Mataro was first planted in Washington State at Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley. In California, Mourv√®dre reached the United States in the 1860s as part of the Pellier collection and was likely first planted in Santa Clara County. The variety, known as Mataro, was widely planted in anonymous field blends that was used primarily for bulk produced jug wines. From the middle of the 20th century, it saw its plantings rapidly decline from more than 2700 acres in 1968 to less than a third of that by the 2000s.C. E. Olken and J. Furstenthal The New Connoisseurs' Guidebook to California Wine and Wineries pg 43 University of California Press, Berkeley (2010) Its numbers would have declined more drastically had the variety not captured the interest of Rhone Rangers in the late 20th century who began seeking out old vine plantings of the variety in vineyards Contra Costa County. On the heels of some critically acclaimed varietal and Rhone-style blends (as well as the introduction of better quality clones) featuring Mourv√®dre plantings in California risen slightly from 260 ha (650 acres) at the turn of the 21st century to 900 acres in 2010. There are around 12 square kilometres of Mourv√®dre in Australia, where it is also known as Mataro though more producers have begun adopting the French name Mourv√®dre. While the grape has a long history of being used for generic cask wines and fortified wine, it has recently become more popular in highly acclaimed GSM blends with Grenache and Syrah. Like many grape varieties, Mourv√®dre was first introduced to Australia as part of James Busby's collection of cuttings from his European travels in the 1830s. There it was quickly established in the South Australia wine region of the Barossa Valley by Lutheran immigrants from the Silesia Province in Prussia. From there it was spread by English immigrants to the McLaren Vale region south of Adelaide. Some of the oldest continually producing vines of Mourv√®dre are in the New South Wales wine region of Riverina or South Australian wine region of Riverland.Halliday, James. Wine Atlas of Australia pgs 15-18, 40-43 & 78 Berkeley: University of California, 2007. Turkey Flat Vineyards in the Barossa Valley was one of the forerunners of producing Mourv√®dre as a single varietal wine with its first vintage in 2005.  Other regions  A Spanish Mourv√®dre, known there as Monastrell, from the Bullas wine region. According to Pierre Galet, there are some plantings of Mourv√®dre in Azerbaijan under a variety of synonyms that have not all been fully identified. In South Africa, Rhone-style producers have also begun working with the variety.  Winemaking and wine styles  Example of Mourv√®dre (left) and a saign√©e ros√© (right) separated from the same fermentation batch after a few days of skin contact The small, thick-skin berries of Mourv√®dre are high in phenolic compounds that have the potential to produce a deeply colored, very tannic wine with significant alcohol levels if harvested at high sugar levels. However, the variety is rarely harvested at sugar levels below 13% alcohol (approx 23 Brix) because the flavors at those lower levels are often very weak and herbaceous. In winemaking, wines made from Mourv√®dre are prone to both oxidation and reductive flavors (such as hydrogen sulfide) if care is not taken at the winery. While in Bandol, it is common to ferment Mourv√®dre with the stems, the grapes usually go through a crusher/destemmer in New World regions such as a California due to the harsher, green tannins that are more typical of the stems in those regions. While the wine can be stored in oak barrels, it often does not absorb oak flavors as well as other varieties (such as Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon) so it is often stored in neutral oak or large format barrels. In many regions of the world, Mourv√®dre is often blended with other varieties such as Grenache and Syrah in the \\"GSM\\" blends of Rh√¥ne, Australia and the United States. In these blends, Mourv√®dre often provides color, fruit and some tannic structure to complement the fruity Grenache and elegant Syrah. In Provence and Rh√¥ne it also sometimes blended with Cinsault and Carignan as part of both red table wines and ros√©. In Australia, the variety is sometimes used in fortified port- style wines. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, in favorable vintages Mourv√®dre can produce highly perfumed wines with intense fruit flavors and notes of blackberries and gamy or meaty flavors. Oz Clarke notes that some examples of Mourv√®dre may come across as faulted in their youth with \\"farmyard-y\\" and strong herbal flavors. As the wine ages, more earthy tertiary aromas may develop before becoming more leather and gingerbread aroma notes. In both Old and New World wine regions, Mourv√®dre is a popular grape to be used in ros√© winemaking. These wines can be made as a dedicated ros√© where the skins are allowed only a brief period of skin contact (a few hours or a single day) before they are pressed or as saign√©e where some of the juice destined for a red Mourv√®dre is \\"bled off\\" during fermentation creating two separate wines‚Äîa darker, more concentrated red wine and the lighter ros√©.E. Goldstein \\"Perfect Pairings\\" pg 5 University of California Press 2006 Synonyms and relationship to other grapes Mourv√®dre is the name used in France. Worldwide, there are 95 other names, including Mataro, which is used in Portugal and parts of the New World; and Monastrell, which is used in Spain. In English-speaking wine producing areas, Mourv√®dre is most commonly used; it is the official name used by the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.Integrated Viticulture Online s.v. Mourv√®dre, University of California. Despite the similarities of its synonyms, Mourv√®dre has no relation to the Spanish wine grape Graciano which is also known as Morrastel in France. At one point, the Cognac grape Balzac blanc was thought to be a color mutation of Mourv√®dre due to the similarities in synonyms with Mourv√®dre also being known as Balzac noir. However, DNA analysis at the turn of the 21st century showed that the two varieties had no relation.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J.

It is located at (OS grid ref. SD233637). It is one of the Islands of Furness. It is the location of the English Heritage-owned Piel Castle. The island is within the administrative boundaries of the mainland town of Barrow-in-Furness and is owned by the people of the town, having been given by the Duke of Buccleuch in the early 20th century. The Borough Council's administrative duties also include the selection of the \\"King\\" of Piel, who is the landlord of the island's public house, the Ship Inn. The area of Piel is about . As well as the landlord and his family the island has three other permanent residents who live in the old Pilots Cottages. History Piel Castle In the Middle Ages Piel was known as Fowdray (or Fouldrey or Fowdrey) island. This name would seem to be derived from the Old Norse words ', meaning \\"fodder\\", and ay or oy, meaning \\"island\\". The island's known history dates from the time of King Stephen who, in 1127, gave the island to the Savignac monks as part of a land grant for an abbey. When the Savignacs became part of the Cistercian order later in the 12th century, the island came under the control of the Cistercians at nearby Furness Abbey. In the early 13th century the Cistercians used Piel as a safe harbour and built a warehouse for the storage of grain, wine and wool. Some of these commodities were shipped over from Ireland. In 1212 the monks were granted a licence by King John to land one cargo of \\"wheat, flour and other provisions\\" to stave off a famine caused by the failure of the local harvest. Later in the century an unlimited cargo licence was granted and in 1258 ships owned by the abbey were placed under royal protection. The monks fortified the island, firstly with a wooden tower surrounded by a ditch with palisades, and then in 1327 they commenced the building of a motte and bailey fort (also known as a \\"peel\\" - hence the island's modern name). This structure was, at the time, the largest of its kind in northwest England. It was probably built as a fortified warehouse to repel pirates and raiders, but it would appear to have had a measure of success in keeping the customs men at bay as well; smuggling was widespread at the time and the abbey was known to have been involved. Indeed, in 1423 an accusation was made against the Abbott of Furness that he smuggled wool out of the country from \\"la Peele de Foddray\\". The red sandstone ruins of the fort came to be known as the \\"Pile of Fouldrey\\", and are known today as Piel Castle. Romanticist William Wordsworth, who wrote of the island in a poem about his time at RampsideThe next noteworthy episode in the island's history occurred on 4 June 1487 when Lambert Simnel and his supporters arrived from Dublin. Simnel, crowned as \\"Edward VI\\" in Ireland, was being passed off as Edward, 17th Earl of Warwick, the Yorkist heir, by John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln in his attempt to regain the throne for the Yorkists. Simnel and 2,000 German mercenaries made their way via Piel to do battle for the throne. They were eventually defeated at the Battle of Stoke near Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire on 16 June 1487. A customs creek Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537 Piel Island and its castle became the property of the king. The castle's fortifications were strengthened at the time of the Spanish Armada but from then until the Civil War nothing of note happened on the island. The area of Furness was a Parliamentarian stronghold during the Civil War. For this reason the Parliamentarian fleet retreated to Piel Harbour when the Royalists captured Liverpool. In 1662, following the restoration of Charles II, the lordship of Furness was given to the Duke of Albemarle and this included the castle and parts of the island. After this date activity on Piel seems to have revolved around shipping and industry. A salt works is recorded as existing on the island from as early as 1662, which was still apparently present in the 1690s.Elsworth, D., 2007, Ship Inn, Piel Island, Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, Archaeological Evaluation, p10 Piel Island became an important trading post during the 18th century and customs men were permanently stationed there; smuggling was still rife at the time. In the second half of the 18th century the iron ore trade began to develop on the Furness Peninsula and the harbour continued to be important to the local economy. As the volume of shipping increased \\"His Majesty's boatmen\\" were stationed on Piel as harbour pilots and customs inspectors. Their cottages still stand, now used as summer residences by sailors. In formal terms, it was a creek (outstation) of the port of Lancaster, and known as Piel Foudray. In the 19th century the island was the subject of a poem by romanticist William Wordsworth. Piel Island eventually fell under the ownership of the Duke of Buccleuch. He donated it to the people of Barrow-in-Furness in 1920 as a World War I memorial. Modern-day Piel Island Piel Island from Roa Island Being separated from neighbouring Roa Island by the Piel Channel, the island is accessible via a ferryboat from Roa Island pier during summer weekends. Piel can be reached from Walney Island but is only passable with care at low tide. Piel Castle is managed by English Heritage and there is free, unlimited access. The castle, located on the southeast tip of Piel Island, is an impressive ruin made up largely of stones from the beach. The three-storey keep affords good views of the island although it is no longer accessible to visitors. Campers may pitch a tent in its shadows. The island is a haven for wildlife with many different species of sea bird to be found. Visitors should take care not to disturb nesting birds while walking on the beach. A marsh pond in the centre of the island now attracts many other types of bird. The Ship Inn The Ship Inn dates from the late 18th century. Today it provides sustenance for sailors, fishermen and day-trippers to the island. The landlord is known as 'The King of Piel', a title originating from the time of Lambert Simnel and his attempt to usurp the English throne. A tradition associated with the pub is known as the 'Knighthood of Piel'. Local fishermen have handed this down over the centuries. In a room of the inn is a large oak chair and anyone who sits in it is made a 'Knight of Piel'. The ceremonial knighting is carried out by the King of Piel or a fellow knight. The present-day cost of becoming a knight is to buy a round of drinks for all those present. However, the privilege afforded to knights is that they may demand food and lodging off the innkeeper should they be shipwrecked on Piel. The pub's licence ended in November 2005 and Rod Scarr, who had been King of Piel for 20 years, left the island in April 2006. The island thus fell under the control of Barrow Borough Council. The opportunity was taken to fully renovate the pub, though work did not begin until July 2008, shortly before the new 'King of Piel', Steve Chattaway, was crowned (an event that was documented in the TV series Islands of Britain). The origins of the Ship Inn are obscure; it is said to be over 300 years old, but the evidence is uncertain. In 1746 a lease for agricultural land situated within the castle ditch was granted to an Edward Postlethwaite, who is described as an innkeeper from the ‚ÄòPile of Fowdrey‚Äô. The earliest direct reference to an inn, or ‚Äòpublick house‚Äô, is only in 1800. In 1813 a visitor painted a vivid picture of the life of the innkeeper at that time: The earliest map reference, in 1833, refers to the inn as 'The Herdhouse', and the first person who can confidently be identified as a landlord of the Ship Inn is James Hool as he is listed in the 1841 census as a publican.Elsworth, D., 2007, Ship Inn, Piel Island, Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, Archaeological Evaluation, p12-13 References External links * The Ship Inn Website * The Cumbria Directory - Piel Island Category:Islands of Furness Category:Tidal islands of England Category:Tourist attractions in Cumbria Category:Tourist attractions in Barrow-in-Furness Category:Districts of Barrow-in-Furness ","title":"Piel Island"},{"id":"1112813","text":"SUDAAN is a proprietary statistical software package for the analysis of correlated data, including correlated data encountered in complex sample surveys.

In the conventional tail drop algorithm, a router or other network component buffers as many packets as it can, and simply drops the ones it cannot buffer. If buffers are constantly full, the network is congested. Tail drop distributes buffer space unfairly among traffic flows. Tail drop can also lead to TCP global synchronization as all TCP connections \\"hold back\\" simultaneously, and then step forward simultaneously. Networks become under-utilized and flooded‚Äîalternately, in waves. RED addresses these issues by pre-emptively dropping packets before the buffer becomes completely full. It uses predictive models to decide which packets to drop. It was invented in the early 1990s by Sally Floyd and Van Jacobson.  Operation  RED monitors the average queue size and drops (or marks when used in conjunction with ECN) packets based on statistical probabilities. If the buffer is almost empty, then all incoming packets are accepted. As the queue grows, the probability for dropping an incoming packet grows too. When the buffer is full, the probability has reached 1 and all incoming packets are dropped. RED is more fair than tail drop, in the sense that it does not possess a bias against bursty traffic that uses only a small portion of the bandwidth. The more a host transmits, the more likely it is that its packets are dropped as the probability of a host's packet being dropped is proportional to the amount of data it has in a queue. Early detection helps avoid TCP global synchronization.  Problems with classic RED  According to Van Jacobson, \\"there are not one, but two bugs in classic RED.\\" Improvements to the algorithm were developed, and a draft paper was prepared, but the paper was never published, and the improvements were not widely disseminated or implemented. There has been some work in trying to finish off the research and fix the bugs. Pure RED does not accommodate quality of service (QoS) differentiation. Weighted RED (WRED) and RED with In and Out (RIO) provide early detection with QoS considerations.  Other variants  WRED In weighted RED you can have different probabilities for different priorities (IP precedence, DSCP) and/or queues. ARED The adaptive RED or active RED (ARED) algorithm infers whether to make RED more or less aggressive based on the observation of the average queue length. If the average queue length oscillates around min threshold then early detection is too aggressive. On the other hand, if the average queue length oscillates around max threshold then early detection is being too conservative. The algorithm changes the probability according to how aggressively it senses it has been discarding traffic. See Srikant for an in-depth account on these techniques and their analysis. RRED Robust random early detection (RRED) algorithm was proposed to improve the TCP throughput against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, particularly Low-rate Denial-of-Service (LDoS) attacks. Experiments have confirmed that the existing RED-like algorithms are notably vulnerable under Low-rate Denial-of-Service (LDoS) attacks due to the oscillating TCP queue size caused by the attacks. RRED algorithm can significantly improve the performance of TCP under Low-rate Denial-of-Service attacks.

Despite the low yields from its small grapes, it plays a big part in the blends used for ports, and is increasingly being used for table wine in the Douro and D√£o. Touriga Nacional provides structure and body to wine, with high tannins and concentrated flavors of black fruit. Jancis Robinson has compared its relationship with Touriga Francesa to the partnership between Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, the former providing structure, the latter filling out the bouquet.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 216 Mitchell Beazley 1986 Viticulture The vine is very vigorous, and good results depend on keeping it in check. In the Douro it is grown in searing heat in steep schisty vineyards that are more rock than soil. The alternative name of Mort√°gua pays tribute to these harsh conditions. It is usually trained under one of the Guyot systems, and needs severe pruning to keep it under control. In contrast, the vine produces just a few bunches of blue-black grapes which vary in size from 'small' to 'tiny'. Thus yields are among the lowest of any commercial grape variety. In recent years, scientists have been working on cloning the Touriga Nacional to produce vines that are able to pollinate better with the goal of increasing yields by 15% and sugar content by 10%.T.

In the late 1990s there were 2,760 hectares of Touriga Nacional in Portugal. Its poor yields mean that it represents a tiny part of the wine production in the Douro, but it plays a major part in the blends of the best ports. Traditionally a lot of US wine was fortified, and many of the producers of such 'port' have experimented with using Portuguese grapes as a way to improve their product. 553 tons of Touriga were crushed in 2006, up 26% on the previous year.Great article on the new Californian 'ports' Wines The tiny berries of Touriga Nacional have a high skin to pulp ratio which heightens the amount of extract in the wines.

Kenmore Square is a square in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, consisting of the intersection of several main avenues (including Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue) as well as several other cross streets, and Kenmore station, an MBTA subway stop. Kenmore Square is close to or abuts Boston University and Fenway Park, and it features Lansdowne Street, a center of Boston nightlife, and the Citgo sign. It is also the eastern terminus of U.S. Route 20, the longest U.S. Highway. History Boston Hotel Buckminster at intersection of Beacon Street and Brookline Avenue; Sovereign Bank and Pizzeria Uno signs also visible. The land that is now Kenmore Square was originally the swampy, uninhabited corner of the mainland, which marked where the narrow Charles River fed into the wide, marshy Back Bay. It was part of the colonial settlement of Boston until 1705, when the hamlet of Muddy River incorporated as the independent town of Brookline. The land ended up in Brookline because the Muddy River - several blocks to the east - formed the eastern border of the new city.See :Image:Middlesex Canal (Massachusetts) map, 1852.jpg or 1844 Brookline map Known as Sewell's Point at the time, an 1821 map shows the Great Dam, Brighton Road (Brighton Ave and Commonwealth Ave), and Punch Bowl Road (now Brookline Ave) intersecting at Kenmore which was now connected to the mainland to the west, in addition to the southern connection shown in 1777. The portion of Beacon Street west of Kenmore Square was laid out in 1850, intersecting with Avenue Street (now the Allston portion of Commonwealth Avenue), Mill Dam Road (now Brookline Avenue), and Western Avenue, a road traversing the Back Bay mill dam in approximately the modern location of Beacon Street. The Boston and Worcester Rail Road and the Charles River Branch Railroad combined here to cross the Back Bay on a separate railroad bridge, making a beeline for the Leather District. The railroad lines still exist on more or less their original alignments, with the city developing around them. Minor adjustments have been made for the construction of South Station, what is now the MBTA Green Line, and the Massachusetts Turnpike. The town of Brighton was merged with Boston in 1874, and the Boston-Brookline line was redrawn to connect the new Back Bay neighborhood with Allston-Brighton. Even as late as 1880, Kenmore Square was only sparsely developed. By 1890, the Back Bay landfill project had reached Kenmore Square, for the first time fully connecting it with parts of the city to the east. right Streetcar tracks were laid on Beacon Street in 1888, passing through Kenmore Square on the surface, from Coolidge Corner to Massachusetts Avenue. These would eventually become the Green Line C branch. Tracks were laid on what by then was called Commonwealth Avenue in 1896, from Union Square in Brighton. These would later serve the Green Line A branch and Green Line B branch. The Boylston Street subway was extended to Kenmore Square in 1914, where it rose above ground. In 1932, the Kenmore Square portion of the Green Line was put underground, and branch portals opened at Blandford and St. Mary's Streets. In 1915, the Kenmore Apartments were built on the corner of Kenmore and Commonwealth Avenue. Later, the apartments became the Hotel Kenmore with 400 guest rooms. The Kenmore was owned by Bertram Druker, a prominent Boston developer and was known as the baseball hotel. It housed every one of the 14 teams after World War II. From the 1960s to 1979 it was used by Grahm Junior College as a residence hall, cafeteria, library, and classroom facility. Later, after Grahm Junior College closed and larger hotels like the Sheraton were built, the Hotel Kenmore started to show its age and eventually became apartments again. It is now called Kenmore Abbey. In media Gary Cherone reminisces about the Kenmore Square music scene in the 1980s on disc one (track six) of Extreme‚Äôs 2010 live album Take Us Alive.

Produced and distributed by Toho Studios, it is the 21st film in the Godzilla franchise, as well as the sixth film in the franchise's Heisei series. The film is notable for the introduction of the monster SpaceGodzilla, as well as the re-introduction of the mecha character M.O.G.U.E.R.A.; its first appearance on-screen since the 1957 film The Mysterians. Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla stars Megumi Odaka, Jun Hashizume, Zenkichi Yoneyama, Akira Emoto, and Towako Yoshikawa, with Kenpachiro Satsuma as Godzilla. The film was released theatrically in Japan on December 10, 1994, and was commercially successful, despite it receiving mixed reviews. In Japan, the film was followed by Godzilla vs. Destoroyah the following year. Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla was released direct-to-video in the United States in 1999 by Columbia Tristar Home Video. Plot Godzilla cells brought into space by Biollante, in 1990, and Mothra, in 1993, are exposed to intense radiation from a black hole, resulting in the birth of \\"SpaceGodzilla\\", which quickly makes his way to Earth, destroying a NASA space station along the way. Meanwhile, members of the United Nations Godzilla Countermeasures Center arrive at Birth Island in order to plant a mind control device on Godzilla. The Cosmos, Mothra's twin priestesses, appear to psychic Miki Saegusa and warn her of SpaceGodzilla's arrival. M.O.G.U.E.R.A. (Mobile Operations G-Force Universal Expert Robot: Aero-type), a mecha built by the JSDF to replace Mechagodzilla, is sent in to intercept SpaceGodzilla, but suffers damage in the process. SpaceGodzilla lands on Birth Island and attacks Godzilla's offspring, Little Godzilla. Godzilla intervenes but finds himself overwhelmed by SpaceGodzilla, and is powerless to stop his clone from trapping Little Godzilla in a crystal prison. SpaceGodzilla leaves for Japan with Godzilla in pursuit. Shortly thereafter, the Yakuza abduct Miki and bring her back to their base in Fukuoka in an attempt to use her psychic abilities to gain control over Godzilla. Miki is saved by a rescue team before SpaceGodzilla arrives. SpaceGodzilla lands in central Fukuoka and forms a massive fortress of celestial crystals. M.O.G.U.E.R.A. arrives to once again to fight SpaceGodzilla, but is still no match for him. Godzilla arrives in Kagoshima Bay and fights SpaceGodzilla, but SpaceGodzilla easily gains the upper hand. The JSDF discovers that SpaceGodzilla is using Fukuoka Tower as a power converter, using it to transform the Earth's core into an energy that SpaceGodzilla can absorb, slowly killing the planet. While Godzilla wrestles with SpaceGodzilla, M.O.G.E.R.A. splits into two different mechas: the Star Falcon, a flying battleship, and the Land M.O.G.U.E.R.A., a tank with a large drill in front of it. The mechas damage the crystal fortress while Godzilla pushes over Fukuoka Tower, cutting off SpaceGodzilla's energy supply. M.O.G.U.E.R.A. quickly reforms and blasts off SpaceGodzilla's crystal-like shoulder formations, weakening him. SpaceGodzilla critically damages M.O.G.U.E.R.A., but is subsequently incinerated by Godzilla's supercharged atomic heat ray. SpaceGodzila is destroyed, but the JSDF claims that if they keep polluting space another SpaceGodzilla may appear someday. Godzilla makes his way back to Birth Island after Miki uses her psychic powers to remove the mind control device from his neck which he turns to her and nods in gratitude. Little Godzilla is then freed from the crystal prison and begins blowing tiny radioactive bubbles. Cast Production Early concept art of SpaceGodzilla Although director Kensho Yamashita and screenwriter Hiroshi Kashiwabara had more experience in producing teen idol movies, they were not newcomers to the kaiju genre, having both assumed minor roles in the making of Terror of Mechagodzilla. The two decided early in production to make the film more lighthearted than its predecessors and more focused on character development, centering it on Megumi Odaka's recurring character Miki Saegusa, who had previously played marginal roles in the series. The emphasis on lightheartedness was such that a scene depicting Godzilla desperately trying to rescue his son from SpaceGodzilla's crystal prison was deleted on account of its seriousness, a move disapproved of by Godzilla suit actor Kenpachiro Satsuma. The idea of a \\"Space Godzilla\\" was first conceived in 1978, and was designed as a homage to the monster's hinted progenitor Biollante by incorporating tusks and a hissing roar reminiscent of the latter monster. Creature designer Shinji Nishikawa had initially envisioned SpaceGodzilla as a much more western dragon-like creature with large fin-like wings on the back. The final design bore greater resemblance to Godzilla's final form from the video game Super Godzilla, itself also designed by Nishikawa.David Milne, \\"Shinji Nishikawa Interview\\", Kaiju Conversations (December 1995) Effects artist Koichi Kawakita redesigned Godzilla's son as a more cartoonish-looking character, having disliked the more dinosaurian-looking version in Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II. It was rumoured that Kawakita intended to use the new design in a children's spinoff TV special entitled Little Godzilla's Underground Adventure. However, this was nothing more than a myth. The M.O.G.U.E.R.A. suit was worn by Mechagodzilla performer Wataru Fukuda, and consisted of three pieces applied separately. The new Godzilla suit used for the majority of the film combined aspects of the suits used in Godzilla vs. Biollante/Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah and Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II, having a stocky, triangular build, wide shoulders and much less pronounced ribbing on the neck. The face bore similarities to those used in the previous two films, though the eyes were increased in size and given more prominent whites, thus making it relatively less menacing looking than its predecessors. Innovations included the head's ability to fully rotate around the body,Robert Biondi, \\"The Evolution of Godzilla ‚Äì G-Suit Variations Throughout the Monster King‚Äôs Twenty One Films\\", G-FAN #16 (July/August 1995) and the incorporation of an air duct which solved the chronic ventilation problems present in previous suits. The suit from Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II was reused for Godzilla's entrance and exit from Birth Island and during the scene where he is telekinetically tossed by SpaceGodzilla. Composer Akira Ifukube refused to be involved in the film after reading the script, which reminded him too much of a teen idol film and included rap music.David Milner, \\"Akira Ifukube Interview III\\", Kaiju Conversations (December 1995) English version After the film was released in Japan, Toho commissioned a Hong Kong company to dub the film into English. In this international version of the movie, an English title card was superimposed over the Japanese title, as had been done with the previous 1990s Godzilla films. Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla and Godzilla vs. Destoroyah on home video on January 19, 1999. This was the first time either film had been officially released in the United States. TriStar used the Toho dubs, but cut the end credits and created new titles and opening credits for both films. Toho's complete international version of Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla (sans any onscreen text besides the English title) has been broadcast on several premium movie channels since the early 2000s, as well as the 2014 Blu-Ray release. Reception Box office Released on December 10, 1994, the film sold tickets in Japan and grossed around $20,000,000 (U.S) (US$32,000,000 worldwide). As the film's release coincided with the Kobe earthquake, Toho feared that the event would put off audiences due to the film's main battle sequence taking place in the same area, and thus sought to remedy this by lowering ticket prices. Critical reaction The film received mainly mixed reviews. Monster Zero called the film \\"a curiously uninvolving effort\\" that \\"disappoints in nearly all aspects of the production\\".Review ‚Äì Ed Godziszewski . Monster Zero.

The Jesuit Relations, ethnographic documents from the 17th century, refer to the river as Chouacoet. Course The river rises at Saco Lake in Crawford Notch in the White Mountains and flows generally south-southeast through Bartlett and Conway in Carroll County, New Hampshire before crossing into Oxford County, Maine. Shortly after entering Fryeburg, Maine, the river branches into the \\"Old Course\\" Saco River and the more commonly used \\"Canal River\\". Constructed in the 1800s to be more convenient for farmers, the long canal is shorter than the old courseU.S. Geological Survey. 1:24,000-scale Digital Line Graph data. and is now considered to be the official course for the river, as the upstream end of the old course is largely silted over. The two channels merge again near Lovell, Maine. After running through six hydropower stations operated by NextEra Energy Resources (including Skelton Dam and Bonny Eagle Dam), the river enters York County, crosses under Interstate 95, and passes between Saco and Biddeford, where it is bridged by U.S. Route 1. It enters Saco Bay on the Atlantic with Camp Ellis in Saco on the north shore and Hills Beach in Biddeford on the south shore. Stream flow The United States government maintains two stream gauges on the Saco river. The first is at Conway, New Hampshire () where the river's watershed is .

Attractions The Saco River at Saco, Maine, seen from the bridge over U.S. Route 1 The Saco is a popular recreational river, drawing an estimated 3,000 to 7,000 people per summer weekend, mostly on the stretch from Swan's Falls (a campground formerly maintained by the Appalachian Mountain Club and now maintained by the Saco River Recreation Council), to Brownfield, Maine. There are many sand beaches along the Saco when not at flood stage and camping is allowed along some of these beaches for free. Misuse, including large quantities of garbage left behind by users and illegal fires, as well as discourtesy toward landowners, has led many beaches to be posted and monitored. A permit is required from the State of Maine for campfires along any unposted river beaches. The Saco is a major attraction for canoeists. One area of the river, Walker's Rip, is a set of rapids that has caused less talented canoers to capsize, although it can be navigated successfully. Several canoeing rentals are available throughout the river's distance. The Saco river is also famous for sport fishing, even though the number of fish in it has decreased tremendously throughout time. Problems Multiple violent and reportedly alcohol-related incidents in 2001 led to increased police patrols and efforts by livery companies, landowners, and government agencies to improve conditions. Local legends have held that the river is subject to the Saco Curse of Squandro.

Designed during the 1970s and released in 1979, it can control 100,000 telephone lines. The purpose of the DMS-100 Switch is to provide local service and connections to the PSTN public telephone network. It is designed to deliver services over subscribers' telephone lines and trunks. It provides plain old telephone service (POTS), mobility management for cellular phone systems, sophisticated business services such as automatic call distribution (ACD), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), and Meridian Digital Centrex (MDC), formerly called Integrated Business Network (IBN). It also provides Intelligent Network functions (AIN, CS1-R, ETSI INAP). It is used in countries throughout the world. There are also DMS-200 and DMS-250 variants for tandem switches. Much of the hardware used in the DMS-100, with the possible exception of the line cards, is used in other members of the DMS family, including the DMS-200 toll switch. Hardware All power distribution is at -48 VDC (nominal), from which DC to DC converters on every shelf provide other necessary voltages. Central Control Complex (CCC) The Central Control Complex comprises the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Program Store (PS), Data Store (DS) and the Central Message Controller (CMC). Block Diagram of the DMS-100 Telephone Switch The CPU contains two identical 16-bit processors running in hot standby mode. The original CPU core was referred to as the NT40 CPU and was implemented in approximately 250 discrete logic devices across several circuit boards running at 36 MHz. The NT40 core consisted mainly of the NT1X44 stack card, which provides some register and stack functions of the processor, the NT1X45 which contained the arithmetic and logic functions, the NT1X46 which provides more registers and the load- route read-only memory (ROM) and the NT1X47 timing and control card which provides the micro-cycle source and microstore decoding functions of the processor. The NT1X47 card also contained the 2-digit hexadecimal display to indicate test result codes and the condition of the core. The NT1X48 processor maintenance card contained a thumbwheel on the faceplate to enable various diagnostic tests of the CPU. A later modification of these same five circuit boards with faster pin-compatible discrete logic devices enabled the CPU to operate at 40 MHz allowing central offices to improve call throughput capacity by 10 percent. When the CPU is configured in dual hot standby mode, a mate exchange bus (MEB) between the two CPUs enables the state of one CPU to be continuously compared to that of the other CPU on a cycle by cycle basis. Any discrepancy between the two CPUs results in maintenance circuitry determining which CPU is at fault and activity to change to the same CPU. A Program Store is dedicated to each CPU and is a memory for the program instructions required by that CPU for processing calls, maintenance and for administrative tasks. The PS associated with the other CPU contains identical program instructions. A Data Store is dedicated with each CPU and contains dynamic information on a per-call basis, as well as customer data and office-specific settings. The other CPU is also associated with its own DS containing duplicate data. The Central Message Controller controls the flow of messages between the other units of the CCC and prioritizes them for the Network Message Controller (NMC) in the various Network Modules (NM), or the Input/Output Controller (IOC). Both CPUs have access to either CMC which share the message load to the Line Modules or peripherals. The original NT40 based CCC was replaced by the compatible DMS SuperNode in 1987. DMS SuperNode The DMS SuperNode Computing Module was first based on the Motorola 68020 Central Processing Unit (CPU) and then upgraded to the Motorola 68030. In the early 1990s it was further upgraded to use the Motorola 88100 and 88110 Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) CPUs. This RISC version of the SuperNode Computing Module was known as the BRISC (BNR Reduced Instruction Set Computing) CPU. With the BRISC CPU the DMS SuperNode had a processing capacity of 1,500,000 call attempts per hour. DMS SuperNode featured increased processing capacity across a distributed architecture allowing for the development of new features and services. Each of the elements of the DMS SuperNode uses a common SuperNode CPU hardware design differing only in the software used to control them. The SuperNode consists of two main elements: DMS Core and DMS Bus. Northern Telecom DMS-100 SuperNode Architecture Block Diagram DMS Core provides the main computing facility and is made up of the Compute Module, System Load Module and a Message Controller. The Compute Module contains redundant SuperNode CPUs to handle call processing and maintenance functions and, like the NT40 core, can operate in a synchronized mode with its mate. The System Load Module contains all the necessary software for every element of the DMS switch and also provides file system and data storage functions on magnetic tape and hard disk. The Message Controller provides communications links between the DMS Core and the DMS Bus. DMS Bus is used to interconnect the DMS Core, the switching network and the Input/Output controller (IOC) and manage message flows between these units and consists of redundant Message Switches. The Message Switches of the DMS Bus operate in a load-sharing mode and one of them provides the main clock source for the DMS-100 system while the others are synchronized to it. Messages between all SuperNode units are carried by optical DS512 links. The operating system used by both generations of the DMS-100 switch was called Support Operating System (SOS) and was written in a high level language called PROTEL which stood for PRocedure Oriented Type Enforcing Language developed at Bell Northern Research (BNR). Hardware and maintenance are administered locally through cathode-ray terminals, through a multilevel menu system called MAPCI. There are various methods used to access the DMS remotely as well, including modem and telnet. Backups and other hard drive work are administered through a DISKUT command line program. Line Module Analog lines are terminated on individual line cards, each with its own codec, in pull-out Line Drawers in frames. The original design of such frames was called the Line Module (LM) with 32 lines per drawer. LMs were not able to send caller-id information (CLASS services) and became rare late in the century, having been supplemented or replaced by the newer Line Concentrating Module (LCM). Duplicated ringing generators serve each LM or pair of LCM. For DC testing, each line card has a relay to connect it to a test bus. Line Concentrating Module LCM have smaller line cards, serving 64 lines per physical drawer (2 logical drawers) of the same size as in the LM. An LCM require only half the space as an LM for the same number of lines. The majority of line cards are NT6X17, with three relays for loop start lines. Others include NT6X18 which have four or more relays and a slide switch for ground start lines (a newer version of the NT6X18 has eliminated the ground switch). The NT6X18 also has the ability to provide current reversal required for some coin phones and business systems. The NT6X17BA and the NT6X18BA is known as the world line card and is software configurable to more than 15 million functional settings to meet almost any signalling and transmission requirement in any market. Northern Telecom DMS-100 Line Card Drawer showing line cards. NT6X19 line card allows the use of older style, neon message- waiting lamps, this feature also requires an addition card per drawer that supplies the voltage. Type NT6X21 cards serve P-sets (Meridian Business Sets), a special analogue telephone with a proprietary Nortel data link operating at 8 kHz to provide advanced call handling services. For example, a telephone number may appear on multiple P-sets even though each such telephone has only one pair of wires, thus providing a simpler replacement for key telephone systems. An LCME, for ISDN service, which uses NTBX27 cards serve Basic Rate ISDN lines. When provided with ring generators, an LCME can also support other linecard types. LCMs are served by a Line Group Controller (LGC) and communicate over DS-30 connections to NT6X48AA interface cards on the LGC. The number of LCMs per LGC depends on traffic: 3-4 LCM per LGC but as few as two where traffic is heavy. DMS-100 Peripheral Configuration Remote Cluster Controller Remote offices, anywhere from a kilometre to 100 km from the host, can be served by a Remote Line control Module (RLCM), Remote Switching Center (RSC); a later vintage is known as RCC2. They use T1 links to the host LGC. RCCs/RCC2s work like LGCs in controlling LCMs. Large remotes may have 2+ RCC/RCCs and they can be equipped with links between the RCCs - Interlinks; so calls within the remote do not tie up host links. The RCCs/RCC2s are usually equipped so they will provide calling within the remote office if the host links fail; this feature is called ESA; Emergency Stand Alone. Remote Units Another type of remote office is known as Remote Carrier Urban (RCU). Such units typically reside on the side of a road in a large box, approx 3 meters across, almost 2 meters high and almost a meter through. In the 1980s many telcos installed an early version of these instead of pulling more cable into a remote area. They were much cheaper and could provide up to approx 500 lines. Back then they needed two 'boxes' to work- a host box called a Central Terminal (CT) that had the dial tone lines wired into it and a remote box called a Remote terminal (RT) where the dial tone 'came out'. They used 2-6 T1 links on copper - i.e. LD-1 or fiber. As Telcos modernized, these same remote boxes were re-configured to work directly from a SMU peripheral at the host DMS. Typically each SMU can handle 3-6 RCUs. Trunk Modules Transmitters, receivers and other service circuits are in Trunk Module (TM) and Miscellaneous Trunk Module (MTM) shelves. Trunks are on DTC (Digital Trunk Controller) or DTCI (Digital Trunk Controller ISDN) or PDTC (PCM30 Digital Trunk Controller) shelves, usually two T-1 lines per card, ten cards per DTC for a total of 480 ds0 voice channels. At the turn of the century many original NT6X50AA cards were still in service that cannot perform T-carrier extended superframe signaling, this can be performed with a plug-in replacement NT6X50AB card, used for services such as PBX ISDN T1s. Trunks can also be provisioned on SPM (Synchronus Peripheral Module) capable of handling 2016 DS0s, nearly 4.2x more than the DTC. Line Controllers Internal connections to the time switch (network) are on 2.56 Mbit/s (DS-30) Speech Links, each carrying thirty channels plus synchronization and data channels, on four wires plus a ground wire. Connections to the network are handled by the NT6X40AA DS-30 interface card on an LGC or LTC and these link may also be DS-512 optical interfaces. Using the NT6X44AA time switch card, LGCs and LTCs internally map channels on the NT6X48AA DS-30 & NT6X50AA/AB DS1 interface links to available channels on NT6X40AA DS-30 or NT6X40FA DS-512 interfaces out to the network. European PDTCs were complemented by the DTCOI2 and DTCO2. The DTCOI2 was designed to run PRI and DPNSS services as per existing PDTCOI and MSB7 peripherals. The DTCO2 was designed to carry CAS and SS7 as per existing PDTCO peripheral. Northern Telecom DMS-100 Digital Trunk Controller (DTC) Time Division switching is performed in E-Net, similar to the Communication Module of 5ESS switch or the Switching Network of EWSD or the Group Switch of AXE telephone exchange. Successors There are also DMS-200 and DMS-250 variants for tandem switches. In 2006 Nortel introduced the Communication Server 1500 (CS 1500) Softswitch based on VOIP to modernize the DMS based telephone switches. A CS 1500 softswitch system can replace all the DMS component modules except for the LCMs, reducing the footprint of a DMS-100 to one 19\\" rack and allowing operators to reduce cooling and power requirements significantly. A successor to the DMS-100 is the Communication Server 2000 (CS2K), which shares many components and software with the DMS. The significant difference is the addition of VOIP technology into the CS2K.

It included the elevation of the Bavarian frontier march of Austria (') to a duchy, which was given as an inheritable fief to the House of Babenberg. Content The name is opposed to the 14th century ', which was a forgery drawn up at the behest of the Habsburg duke Rudolf IV of Austria. The recipient of the ' was Frederick's paternal uncle, the Babenberg margrave Henry II Jasomirgott. In addition to the elevation of his margraviate, the emperor determined that inheritance should also be possible through the female line of the ducal family. In the absence of children, the duke was allowed to designate a successor ('). However, this extraordinary privilege was bound to the persons of Henry Jasomirgott and his wife Theodora Komnene (') for life, as both had no children and Henry's brothers Otto I of Freising and Conrad I of Passau had chosen ecclesiastical careers. The emperor reserved for himself the act of enfeoffment but would respect Henry's choice. The duke's duty to attend the Imperial Diet was limited to those cases where it convened within the Bavarian lands ('), which saved costly traveling throughout the Empire. Also, Austria was henceforth only required to provide troops to the emperor in wars in its vicinity ('). Henry Jasomirgott was obliged to further on discharge his traditional duties as former margrave. Background The issue of the Privilegium Minus document is to be seen within the context of the conflict that pitted the Imperial House of Hohenstaufen against the ducal House of Welf in the Holy Roman Empire. In 1138 Emperor Frederick's uncle and predecessor, King Conrad III of Germany had deposed the reluctant Bavarian duke Henry the Proud and had enfeoffed his duchy to the Austrian margrave Henry Jasomirgott. King Conrad died in February 1152 and a few weeks later his nephew Frederick was elected King of the Romans, probably with the support of late Henry the Proud's son Henry the Lion. The young king and Henry the Lion were cousins through Frederick's mother Judith of Bavaria, sister of Henry the Proud. Frederick prepared for a campaign to Rome to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor and in order to gain military support wished to end the conflict he had inherited from his uncle. He called for a diet at W√ºrzburg ‚Äîhowever, Henry Jasomirgott, who anticipated the king's intentions, did not appear under the pretext, that he had not been duly summoned. After several attempts to make an arrangement, Frederick left for Italy and was crowned Emperor on 18 June 1155. Back in Germany, Frederick resolved upon returning the Duchy of Bavaria to Henry the Lion. He finally was able to hold a secret meeting with Henry Jasomirgott on 5 June 1156 near the Bavarian capital Regensburg. After the conditions were fixed, the emperor called for another diet in Regensburg on 8 September, where the Babenberger officially renounced the Bavarian duchy, which passed to the Welf Henry the Lion. To make up for the loss, Austria with the explicit consent by the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire, led by Duke Vladislaus II of Bohemia, was raised to the status of a duchy. Frederick thereby avoided the degradation of Henry Jasomirgott to the rank of a margrave, which would have lacked any explanation and furthermore would have exposed Henry Jasomirgott to persecution by the Welfs. On the other hand, Henry the Lion only received a diminished Bavarian duchy and Henry Jasomirgott's right of ' would prevent any succession of the House of Welf in Austria. Disappointed, Henry the Lion turned to his Saxon estates in Northern Germany. Frederick prevailed, settling the long-time conflict, keeping the Welfs covered and securing support by the House of Babenberg. Only much later, the document turned out to be the founding act for what was to become a nation. 1156 is therefore sometimes given as Austria's date of independence, which it gained from Bavaria. Application 13th century succession crisis Because the Babenberg Austria was inheritable by female lines, two rival candidates emerged after the last male Babenberg Frederick II, Duke of Austria, Styria and Carinthia died in 1246. * Herman VI, Margrave of Baden (died 1250), second husband of Gertrude of Babenberg, the daughter of the late Henry of Modling, the elder brother of the now late Duke Frederick. She was the primogenitural heir of Duke Frederick and the entire Babenberg line of Dukes of Austria. Her first husband Vladislav of Bohemia, Margrave of Moravia (died 1247) had already claimed the Austrian duchy against duke Frederick, as Gertrude was heiress of the elder brother. After Herman's death, her third husband Roman, Prince of Novogrudok (married 1252, divorced 1253) continued the claim in 1252-53. And then Gertrude and Herman's son Frederick I, Margrave of Baden's claim was asserted to the Babenberg inheritance, but he was killed in 1268, leaving a sister (the future Countess of Heunburg) to continue the line. * King Ottokar II of Bohemia (1233‚Äì78), since 1252 husband of the (childless) Margaret of Babenberg, dowager Queen of the Romans and the only surviving sister of Duke Frederick. By proximity of blood, she was the closest surviving relative of the last duke. Ottokar and Margaret were proclaimed Duke and Duchess of Austria. However, Margaret was barren and they got divorced in 1260, Ottokar marrying a younger woman. Margaret died in 1267 and left no children (so her heiress would be Gertrude again) - but Ottokar kept Austria, Styria etc. claiming to be the heir designated by Margaret in their divorce settlement. He held the duchies until deposed by king Rudolf I of Germany in 1276. 18th century succession crisis The Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 was partially based on provisions of the Privilegium Minus of Austria. Although not given to the Habsburgs but to the Babenbergs, it anyway allowed female heirs to succeed in Austria, and it designated to the Duke the right to name a successor in absence of heirs. It led to the War of Austrian Succession.  References  Further reading Blackwell, Basil, Source for the History of Medieval Europe (1966), pp. 160‚Äì164.

At the age of 12 he started playing drums and listening to Otis Redding songs. Cerrone's passion for music was discouraged by his father, who tried to distract him from his obsession. By the end of the 1960s, he was fascinated by Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana and Blood, Sweat & Tears, among others. At the age of 17, he convinced Gilbert Trigano to hire rock bands for his holiday clubs: Club Med (Club Mediterran√©e). Cerrone became the A&R; scout for 40 Club Med vacation villages around the world. Kongas His first recordings as a part of Kongas were released on Barclay Records, where he issued his first hit single, \\"Boom\\", and the 1974 album Afro-Rock. He is most famous from the Kongas days for \\"Anikana-O\\", co-written and produced by Alec R. Costandinos. A remix was done by Tom Moulton for the US release on Salsoul Records. This mix was also used on other international releases. Love in C Minor Based in Paris, Cerrone recorded, composed, and performed his solo debut Love in C Minor, again with Costandinos. Released on his own Malligator imprint, and distributed by Warner Filipacchi in France, it immediately shocked audiences with its controversial cover. Copies of the LP were sent to the US, apparently in error, but it was heard by New York DJs who began playing it. Atlantic Records signed Cerrone to a contract, and the musician relocated to the U.S.. The album was later released with a new, tamer cover that took flashes of nude women into the background and replaced them with four arms clenched instead for the American release. As well as \\"Love in C Minor\\", it also featured a cover version of Los Bravos's \\"Black Is Black\\" and \\"Midnite Lady\\", an instrumental piece. Cotillion Records released the album through Warner distribution in the U.S. The album was released unedited in Canada, using the original master tapes. This was the final collaboration between Cerrone and the Egyptian-born Costandinos, who went on to create dancefloor hits such as \\"I've Found Love\\" by Love & Kisses, and the disco opera re-telling of the story of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\". Reviewing Cerrone in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau gave it a B-plus and wrote, \\"Catchy tracks, a remake of 'Black Is Black,' and a new standard in disco porn‚Äîthe protagonist brings three women to simultaneous orgasm while keeping one finger on the 'Door Close' button.\\" Cerrone's Paradise Cerrone continued using pieces of photographic and audio erotica when he released his second album, Cerrone's Paradise. It was recorded with Alain Wisniak co writing and arranged by Raymond Donnez, also known as \\"Don Ray\\", as part of his arrangement entourage after parting company with Costandinos. The original French album cover featured a naked model draped over the top of a fridge with a jar of white powder spilled in front of it.

The album also featured \\"Sweet Drums\\", a three-minute-and-ten-second drum breakdown. The original French album cover was again different, having a gatefold opening with nudes in the centre. The music itself was the same. \\"Supernature\\" was used as the theme music to Thames TV's The Kenny Everett Video Show (as well as being danced to by Hot Gossip in the same show), which was shown across the United Kingdom.Marc Cerrone profile, Internet Movie Database; retrieved 20 May 2013] The Golden Touch After the success of Supernature, Cerrone IV: The Golden Touch Cerrone signed up for management with Steven and Martin Machat. They helped oversee his worldwide career. Steven Machat negotiated a new deal for Cerrone in the US and Canada with Atlantic and CBS outside the US, Canada as well as France. These were major artists deals for that time period. The album got great reviews in the US and Atlantic threw a party in New York City, October 1978 that was one of the largest parties ever thrown for an artist up to that point in time. The album was another Cerrone U.S. disco chart-topper. Driven by \\"Je Suis Music\\", \\"Look for Love\\", and the urban-slanted \\"Rocket in the Pocket\\" which featured Jimmy Page on guitar, this album showed his fusion attributes, foreshadowing his future releases. Cerrone then ventured into movie scoring, supplying the music score for Brigade Mondaine, a French film. Alternate mixes of his hits were made, such as \\"Give Me Love\\", \\"Phonic\\" (originally released as a 12\\" single on the Crocos label), and \\"Striptease\\". The latter was an underground hit, introduced to international audiences through the Disconet subscription service for DJs. It was a key inclusion on \\"Cerrone by Bob Sinclar\\". Cerrone V‚ÄìXIII Cerrone V marked a radical departure for the artist, where he made a full-fledged attempt to become the vocalist. Moving from Cotillion to Atlantic Records in the U.S., \\"Rock Me\\" was the first single and, although clubs reacted fairly well, it did not reach the heights of his previous releases. Sonically, it bears a resemblance to \\"Hot Stuff\\" by Donna Summer. Recorded in Los Angeles with the musicians backing Toto, Cerrone co- wrote \\"Call Me Tonight\\" with producer Bob Esty and vocalist/lyricist Michelle Aller. His sixth album, Cerrone VI, was the first of his albums not to be released in the U.S. and was issued on Malligator and Unidisc in Canada. Unlike his previous albums, this non-rhythmic offering, using new electronic elements such as the Fairlight CMI computer, was more of Cerrone exploring the entire musical landscape. Lyricist Pamela Forrest, a Liverpool-born, Paris- based lyricist, added her magic to the album. The instrumental, Herb Alpert- inspired \\"Rendezvous\\" received scattered Adult Contemporary airplay in Canada. Cerrone also returned to the erotic album covers, using an existing Cheyco Leidmann photograph of a bare-breasted blonde in a lawnchair, and inserting himself in the photograph. In a true return to form, \\"You Are the One\\" was the cornerstone of his seventh record. An 11-minute version of \\"Cherry Tree\\" remains on the shelf. This album was rumoured to have been recorded twice: first with Stoke-on-Trent, England, native Kay Garner, long the voice of Cerrone's biggest successes; and then with Brown. The version with Garner on the lead vocals has never been released. As a bridge between Cerrone's seventh and eighth albums, a 12\\" single, \\"Tripping on the Moon\\", was released prior and was a blockbuster import hit. Sung by Kay Garner, and vocally reminiscent in tone of \\"Supernature\\", it was never released in North America as a single. It later became a part of Cerrone VIII: Back Track. It was released on John Luongo's Portrait label, distributed by CBS. Although the title track was a mild chart hit in the nightclub, the album's lone bright spot was a re- recording of \\"Supernature\\" sung by Montreal-based Nanette Workman. Workman had a 1973 hit with the song \\"The Queen\\" on Big Tree Records. A short time thereafter, Canadian-born singer Claudja Barry did a cover version of \\"Trippin'\\", released on Personal Records. 1980s‚Äì1990s His ninth album, Your Love Survived, featured male lead vocals other than his own sung by Arthur Simms. Simms along with his brother John had also recorded an album entitledJohn & Arthur Simms with Alec R. Costandinos on his Ibis/Casablanca imprint. Pamela Forrest also rejoined the cast, writing lyrics on the album. Re-recordings of hits such as \\"Give Me Love\\", \\"Look for Love\\", and \\"Call Me Tonight\\" were also featured on this double LP set. Key tracks included \\"Get Your Lovin'\\" and \\"Workout\\". Another return to form was his tenth album, Where Are You Now?. Sung by American Carole Rowley and released on Malligator in France, Hi-NRG producer and mixer Ian Levine was tabbed to do the mix, prompting a 12\\" release on the Record Shack label. In 1984, \\"Club Underworld\\" was also released as a single, in both France and the United States on Personal Records, with a new mix. Perhaps the most-interesting Cerrone record that was never to be on a full-length album was his interpretation of \\"Standing in the Shadows of Love\\" intertwined with his own composition \\"Freak Connection\\". It was released only in France. Cerrone's boutique label, Crocos, was the home to a number of independently produced projects. \\"Africanism\\" by Kongas, arranged by Don Ray, was an energetic fusion of tribal drum beats and emotive male vocals framed around a cover version of \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\" by Traffic. It was licensed for North American distribution in a deal between Cerrone and Polydor U.S. Don Ray created a furore with his dance-pop album Garden of Love, which was written with Cerrone, the entire album is considered a seminal classic. Hits such as \\"Got to Have Lovin'\\", \\"Body & Soul\\", and \\"Standing in the Rain\\" guided the album to No. 1 Stateside. The previously mentioned Lene Lovich wrote the lyrics. Revelacion, a studio act, released two albums: a side-long version of \\"House Of The Rising Sun\\" on Crocos (which was also released at almost the same time as Santa Esmeralda's second album) and \\"Don't Give A Damn\\", a 16-minute electronic-spiced, downtempo track recalling \\"Music of Life\\" on Malligator. He also produced singles \\"Tonight the Night\\" for percussionist Mo Foster and \\"Phonic\\" by Cristal, the latter of which echoes the synth boom that was started by Space's \\"Magic Fly\\". A song featuring La Toya Jackson was also issued, entitled \\"Oops, Oh No\\". In 1992, Cerrone's show Dreamtime ran on Broadway at The Ed Sullivan Theater. In 1995 the Dream CD, with music from the Broadway musical Dreamtime, was released by Malligator, a division of Unidisc Music Inc. Recent projects By the 2000s, Cerrone's European success helped his 2002 hit \\"Hysteria\\", and the album become a success. By 2007, he issued the song \\"Laisser Toucher\\". It is the lead single from his album Celebrate!, released in early 2008. The second single from the album was \\"Misunderstanding\\". Cerrone issued his twentieth album release, Love Ritual on 7 July 2008. The lead single is the title track which preceded the full-length album. \\"Love Ritual\\" also has a supporting music video. It was quickly followed by the next two singles, \\"It Had to Be You\\" and \\"Tattoo Woman\\". The single, \\"Tattoo Woman\\" with remixes by Jamie Lewis was made available domestically in the U.S. on traxsource.com. On 12 March 2009, Cerrone released the album Cerrone by Jamie Lewis for free on his website. He stated that \\"music is condemned to be free and that it is necessary to find other solutions to make revenues\\". In September 2016 he released the single \\"Move Me\\" featuring Brendan Reilly as a precursor to the forthcoming album Red Lips. It was followed by a remix EP of the same song in January 2017 released through Big Beat Atlantic Records. Notable performances He performed in front of hundreds of thousands of people at huge concerts and events such as the 2005 Dance Party Live in Versailles and the 2000 Los Angeles Millennium C√©l√©bration where, at the request of the Mayor of Los Angeles, Cerrone staged the initials Hollywood and produced an exceptional opera. Also in 1989, he performed in the concert at Paris's Place de la Concorde for the celebration of the bicentenary of the Revolution in front of more than 600,000 spectators. In 1991 he performed a concert event in Tokyo for the launch of the first HD satellite TV channel in Japan. He claims, and it is often credited by others, that he was \\"the first\\" to put the kick drum (or bass drum) into the foreground of modern dance music. * In November 1988, he organized a production of the rock opera The Collector on the square of Trocad√©ro (the site of the Palais de Chaillot) at the request of Jack Lang, then the French Minister of Culture, and the City Hall of Paris. * On 14 July 1989, he participated in the celebrations of the Bicentenary of the French Revolution on the edges of the Seine. * In 1991, Cerrone performed the concert show \\"Harmony\\", which took place in the Port of Tokyo during the evening for the launch of the first Japanese high definition television channel. * On 12 July 1996, he produced a show of sounds and lights for peace, with the support of the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, settled off the Promenade des Anglais in Nice. * He played at the Los Angeles Millennium Celebration, which was held to mark the passage into the year 2000. * On 1 July 2005, he organized a free concert at the Palace of Versailles, claiming it was \\"the biggest discotheque in the world\\" which was followed the next day by the concert Live 8. * On 17 November of the same year, he released the DVD Live Cerrone at Versailles. * In 2008, with his old accomplice Nile Rodgers, he organized the \\"NY Dance Party\\" in the middle of Central Park, in New York, recreation of a huge discoth√®que to celebrate thirty years of dance music (the event was originally planned for 6 October 2007 and had to be held in Times Square, between 42nd and 49th Street). Return to the foreground In 2000, Bob Sinclar worked with Cerrone for his disco album, which was released in 2001 under the title Cerrone by Bob Sinclar. In 2002, he released the album Hysteria. The song \\"Hysteria\\" was the only single from the album. In February 2005, he signed the score of the French adaptation of A Clockwork Orange given in the Cirque d'Hiver in Paris. In 2005, Cerrone was promoted to the rank of Commandeur in the Order of Arts and Letters. By 2009, Joey Negro released a remix of Cerrone's \\"Paradise\\". He became one of the members of the jury of the television program X Factor in France on W9 and in Belgium on RTL-TVI. Cerrone Symphony, Variations of Supernature was released in February 2010 with a first single: \\"Supernature Project\\" featuring Dax Riders. \\"Supernature Symphony\\" took place in Paris-La-D√©fense on 2 October 2010, in the evening of \\"Nuit Blanche\\". It was the first date of his tour which included Los Angeles, London, Rome, Dubai and Moscow. Discography Adapted from Discogs.Cerrone discography, discogs.com; retrieved 21 May 2013.

Burwash Landing is located on the Historic Milepost 1093 Alaska (Alcan) Highway. It sits on the northwest shore of Kluane Lake. Several prominent geographic features have been renamed in Southern Tutchone language. Southern Tutchone people Burwash landing is the traditional home of the Southern Tutchone Athabascans. It used to be a summer camp. A revival of the Southern Tutchone language and culture has been taking place in this quiet lakeside community. This is readily apparent to visitors when they pull into town and are met with Southern Tutchone street and traffic signs, within and nearby Burwash Landing. Several prominent geographic features have been renamed in Southern Tutchone and signs can be seen along the Alaska (Alcan) Highway. Burls Burwash Landing is known for its black spruce burls. Burls start as an irritation in the spruce. The tree sends extra sap as healant, which creates a growth (burl). Burls are either \\"green,\\" harvested from live trees in the spring, or they are \\"dry burls,\\" taken from dead burl trees. Burls are peeled off their bark and used in their natural form as fenceposts, for example, or they may be shaped and finished into a variety of objects, such as bowls. Check the Burlbilly Hill on the Milepost 1061.6, the visitor will see rows of \\"burly logs\\" on the hill. Climate Burwash Landing has a typical subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfc), bordering on a dry-winter subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dwc).

From 7 July to 9 July Moray's special mission was service as picketboat southeast of Honsh≈´ in preparation for 3rd Fleet bombardment. Then she continued lifeguard operations. By June 1945, successful American submarine operations had made enemy targets almost nonexistent, and lifeguard duty became a vital mission for American submarines. However, Moray did get a chance at some action, when she and attacked a convoy off Kinkazan, Honsh≈´, 10 July. Allowing Kingfish to attack first, Moray then moved in to fire six torpedoes, then pulled out to rearm and permit Kingfish a second stab. A few moments later one of Moray's torpedoes hit a whaler \\"Fumi Maru No.6\\" {361 GRT}. No other shipping was sighted; on 16 July the patrol was shifted to the Kurile Islands. Moray completed her patrol at Midway 6 August. On 1 September the submarine sailed for the West Coast, arriving San Francisco, California, 11 September. She then went into deactivation overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard. She decommissioned 12 April 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet in January 1947. She was redesignated an Auxiliary Research Submarine AGSS-300 on 1 December 1962.

It began east of the village of Skaneateles and ran east across southern Onondaga and Madison counties to Richfield Springs in northern Otsego County. The road began and ended at the Cherry Valley Turnpike, part of the Great Western Turnpike system, and largely paralleled the Cherry Valley Turnpike between Skaneateles and Richfield Springs. Most of the road is now county-maintained, but a handful of sections are now part of New York state touring routes. Route description The Skaneateles Turnpike began at the Cherry Valley Turnpike in the hamlet of Clintonville that at that time hada a Tavern and a large barn for the stagecoach horses and was located about east of the village of Skaneateles in western Onondaga County. West of this point, the Cherry Valley Turnpike served Skaneateles and eventually connected to the Seneca Turnpike. The Skaneateles Turnpike headed generally southeastward from Clintonville, running along part of Otisco Lake before leaving the lake shore and taking a more easterly routing toward the village of Tully. From Tully, the road took on a slightly northeasterly alignment for , passing through Fabius, New Woodstock, and Erieville on its way to Eaton. At Eaton, the turnpike veered southeast to serve Hamilton before curving back to the northeast at East Hamilton. The remaining of the turnpike served only a handful of small hamlets, scattered across sparsely populated areas of modern Madison and Otsego counties. The largest of these were Brookfield in eastern Madison County and Leonardsville, a riverside community located just south of where the road crossed the Unadilla River. Past the river, the turnpike continued generally northeastward across the rural northwestern corner of Otsego County to the village of Richfield Springs, where it ended at the Cherry Valley Turnpike in the village center. History The Skaneateles Turnpike was incorporated under the name \\"the President and Directors of the Hamilton and Scaneatelas Turnpike\\" on April 2, 1806.The Revised Statutes of the State of New-York, Volume III, 1829, p. 595 In 1807 the company was authorized to intersect the Great Western Turnpike (now U.S. Route 20) at any point east of the west branch of the Unadilla River. The connection was ultimately made at Richfield Springs. In western Onondaga County, the turnpike is now New York State Route 174 (NY 174), County Route 124 (CR 124), and CR 23\\\\. From CR 23's east end in Tully to West Woodstock, Madison County, it is now NY 80\\\\. While NY 80 follows NY 13 south from West Woodstock, the turnpike's path heads east to West Eaton as CR 52\\\\. Here, NY 26 joins the road, only to leave to the east in Eaton. Between Eaton and Hamilton, the old road is Hamilton Hill Road and Eaton Street (CR 85). The remainder of the Skaneateles Turnpike between Hamilton and the Unadilla River is part of CR 70 and all of CR 72, CR 74, and CR 80\\\\. Across the river in Otsego County, the turnpike is now part of CR 21 and CR 25\\\\. A section between the two roads is locally maintained. While most of the old turnpike is now known by other names, several sections still reference the turnpike in their road name. In Otsego County, CR 25 is named Old Skaneateles Turnpike while CR 21 and the town-maintained segment between CR 21 and CR 25 are named Skaneateles Turnpike. The turnpike's old name is also used for CR 80 in Madison County.

The terms refer to any news story or article whose main focus is describing how a particular candidate or candidates is faring during the election, in other words, trying to predict the outcome. This category includes polls. There is a thin line between a horse race news story and a non horse race news story. For example, an article simply describing a candidate's economic policy is a non horse race article, but an article which is about how certain groups of voters are angry at a candidate's economic policy is a horse race article. Criticisms of horse race coverage Critics of the news media say that the vast majority of all articles during a political election are horse race style. Different criticisms have been raised as to why that is bad: *It is argued that news sources tend to use horse race journalism as a ploy to lure in audiences and tighten polls during election cycles by discrediting candidates favored to win and hyping underdogs *Horse race coverage is considered by some to cause voters to change their actual perceptions on a candidate in a sort of vicious cycle. For example, a poll showing a third party candidate having a low support percentage may discourage other people from voting for that person so as to avoid the spoiler effect. That effect is magnified if a particular media outlet has a biased point of view that they want to get across. One way that a biased news outlet would use this technique is similar to the \\"some say\\" rhetorical device, namely by making uncited references to constituent outrage or support of some particular issue. *Some say that horse race coverage destroys coverage of the issues, because often, an article is mostly about how groups reacted to a speech or other presentation of a candidate on an issue and has little room to discuss the candidate's point of view itself. *A horse race style of article allows for the use of weasel words: a subtle way of editorializing on the part of the author by focusing on the criticisms or praise of an anonymous or small group of voters. *It is argued that horse race coverage distracts voters from issues surrounding candidates by emphasizing poll results, regardless of how reliable the polls may be.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1995 to 1999,River Heights Riding Profile and was a cabinet minister in the government of Premier Gary Filmon from 1997 to 1999. The son of Leslie Radcliffe and Edith Bole, he was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree and an LL.B. from the University of Manitoba. From 1970 to 1996, he was a partner in the firm of Baker, Radcliffe, Murray, Kovnats. Radcliffe was a freemason but is now the Grand Knight for the St. Ignatius Church council (#5808) of the Knights of Columbus. In 1974, he married Linda Anne Leach. In 1912, Radcliffe's father was planning to travel on what turned out to be the final voyage of the RMS Titanic with his uncle Charles Sedgwick and aunt Adelaide, who were on their way to Mexico City. In the end, because of concerns about safety related to the Mexican Revolution, the uncle made the voyage alone; his body was never found. In the Canadian general election of 1993, Radcliffe ran as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party in the riding of Winnipeg South Centre. The riding was held by Lloyd Axworthy at the time, and was considered as safe for Liberal Party of Canada; Radcliffe received only 3878 votes, against Axworthy's 25667. In the provincial election of 1995, Radcliffe ran as a Progressive Conservative in the upscale west-end Winnipeg riding of River Heights. He was successful on this occasion, defeating Liberal Anita Neville (later a federal MP) by 994 votes. Radcliffe was appointed to cabinet on January 6, 1997, serving as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs with responsibility for the Gaming Control Act. On February 5, 1999, he became the province's Minister of Labour, with responsibility for the Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Superannuation Act, the Civil Service Special Supplementary Severance Benefits Act (1983), the Public Servants Insurance Act and the Workers Compensation Act. The Progressive Conservatives were defeated by the New Democratic Party under Gary Doer in the provincial election of 1999. The NDP does not have a strong base in River Heights, and Radcliffe would probably not have had difficulty being re-elected under normal circumstances. It was to his misfortune, however, that provincial Liberal leader Jon Gerrard decided to contest the riding. Although the Liberals as a whole ran a poor provincial campaign and lost 10% from their 1995 support level, Gerrard's personal popularity was such that he was able to defeat Radcliffe by 465 votes. Radcliffe attempted to defeat Gerrard in a rematch in the 2003 provincial election, but lost by almost 2000 votes. In 2004, Radcliffe was the official campaign agent for Raj Joshi, Conservative candidate in Winnipeg South Centre.

They were intended for use on the line from to and , which was electrified in 1967. Appearance Outwardly, the units were virtually identical to the earlier Class 303 units built in 1960. The interiors were also very similar, including the panoramic full forward passenger view through the glass-walled driving cabs, although the Class 311s had fluorescent lighting (unlike the Class 303s which were fitted with tungsten filament bulbs). The larger fleet of class 303 units had been built by Pressed Steel at their factory in Linwood, Paisley. By the time the Class 311 were required, Pressed Steel no longer built railway carriages, so Cravens of Sheffield worked to the same original drawings, updated at a few points, to build the trains. Along with the Class 303s, the wrap-around driving cab windows were replaced with flat, toughened glass in the 1970s to give better protection to drivers in the event of attacks by stone-throwing vandals. Construction 19 units were built, initially classified as AM11 units, and numbered 092-110. This was later changed to Class 311 under the TOPS system, and the units were renumbered 311092-110. Each unit was formed of three carriages; two outer driving trailers and an intermediate motor coach. The technical description of the formation was BDTCOL+MBSO+DTSO. Individual carriages were numbered as follows: *76403-76421 - BDTCOL *62163-62181 - MBSO *76422-76440 - DTSO Operations The units were built to operate services on the newly electrified routes from to and to ; now known as the Gourock and Wemyss Bay branches of the Inverclyde Line. In practice, the Class 311s operated almost interchangeably with the Class 303s. The units could be found in service across the Glasgow electrified suburban network (north and south of the Clyde, and as far south as Ayr). Consideration was given to upgrading 11 of the units for the Ayr line electrification until it was found to be cheaper to buy 21 of the new Class 318 units and the plan was cancelled. Withdrawal Being a much smaller and unrefurbished fleet, the Class 311s were replaced (in the 1990s) earlier than the Class 303s. After being withdrawn from normal traffic, two units, nos. 311103/104 were transferred to departmental duties as Class 936 sandite units, nos. 936103/104. These lasted in service until 1999, when they were withdrawn. They were not scrapped immediately as Railtrack was anxious to ensure that one of the units was preserved. In 2002, Railtrack donated one of the units to the Summerlee Heritage Park museum in Coatbridge. The other unit was scrapped in 2003. One of the driving coaches on the unit donated to Summerlee was subsequently scrapped. Preservation *311103 - 76414+62174+76433 - Summerlee Heritage Park, Coatbridge (76414 since scrapped) This unit was the former Class 936 sandite unit, no. 936103, formed of 977844+977845+977846. In February 2017, work finally started on restoring the ex-British Rail Class 311 unit to its original condition.

It was essentially a modified version of the Privilegium minus issued by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1156, which had elevated the former March of Austria into a duchy. In a similar way, the Privilegium maius elevated the duchy into an Archduchy of Austria. The privileges described in the document had great influence on the Austrian political landscape, and created a unique connection between the House of Habsburg and Austria. Background The House of Habsburg had gained rulership of the Duchy of Austria in 1282. Rudolph IV (1339‚Äì1365) attempted to restore the Habsburg influence on the European political scene by trying to build relations with Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg and increasing the respect of the Austrian rulers. However, Rudolph IV did not belong to the seven Prince-electors, who‚Äîas dictated by the Golden Bull of 1356‚Äîhad the power to choose the king. In the same way Charles IV had made Prague the center of his rule, Rudolph did the same for Vienna, giving it special privileges, launching construction projects and founding the University of Vienna. All this aimed at increasing the legitimacy and influence of the House and its Austrian lands. For this purpose, in the winter of 1358/1359, Rudolph IV ordered the creation of a forged document called Privilegium maius (\\"the greater privilege\\"). Document The Privilegium maius consists of five forged deeds, some of which purported to have been issued by Julius Caesar and Nero to the historic Roman province of Noricum, which was roughly coterminous with the modern Austrian borders. Though purposefully modeled on the Privilegium minus, the original of which \\"got lost\\" at the same time, the bundle was already identified as a fake by contemporaries such as the Italian scholar Petrarch. In the Privilegium maius, Rudolf IV declared Austria an \\"archduchy\\", endowed with rights similar to those of the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire such as: * inseparability of the territory * automatic inheritance of the first-born (primogeniture), later extended to female heirs in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 in favour of Archduchess Maria Theresa * independent jurisdiction and legislature, without any possibility to appeal to the Emperor (privilegium de non evocando) * permission to display certain symbols of rule Rudolf also created the title Pfalzerzherzog (\\"Archduke Palatine\\"), similar to the Elector Palatine of the Rhine, the holder of an electoral vote. The first Habsburg ruler who actually used the title of an archduke was Ernest of Iron, ruler of Inner Austria from 1406 to 1424. From the 15th century onward, all princes of the Habsburg dynasty were called Erzherz√∂ge. Effects Emperor Charles IV refused to confirm the Privilegium maius, the forgery being recognised by his advisor, the poet and scholar Petrarch. However, the Habsburg Frederick V of Austria after his election as Holy Roman Emperor was able to grant himself permission to assume the archducal title, later again confirmed by his descendants Rudolf II and Charles VI. It did not, however, involve the electoral dignity itself and in 1519 Archduke Charles I had to borrow an enormous sum (almost 3 tonnes of gold) from Jacob Fugger to bribe the prince- electors to secure his succession as rex Romanorum against his rival for the position, Francis I of France. The Privilegium maius had great influence on the Austrian political landscape. The Habsburg archduke arrogated an almost king-like position, and demonstrated this to outsiders through the usage of special insignia. The Habsburgs gained a new foundation for their rule in these lands; in a way, the House of Habsburg and Austria became a single unit. Thus, the forgery was a success. The family subsequently published special editions of the documents, and forbade all discussion of their authenticity.Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche. . pp.30-35 With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Privilegium maius finally lost its meaning. In 1852, it was proven a forgery by historian Wilhelm Wattenbach.

From an impoverished home background, and mainly self-educated, he became The Manchester Guardians cricket correspondent in 1919 and its chief music critic in 1927, holding the two posts simultaneously until 1940. His contributions to these two distinct fields in the years before the Second World War established his reputation as one of the foremost critics of his generation. Cardus's approach to cricket writing was innovative, turning what had previously been largely a factual form into vivid description and criticism; he is considered by contemporaries to have influenced every subsequent cricket writer. Although he achieved his largest readership for his cricket reports and books, he considered music criticism as his principal vocation. Without any formal musical training, he was initially influenced by the older generation of critics, in particular Samuel Langford and Ernest Newman, but developed his own individual style of criticism‚Äîsubjective, romantic and personal, in contrast to the objective analysis practised by Newman. Cardus's opinions and judgments were often forthright and unsparing, which sometimes caused friction with leading performers. Nevertheless, his personal charm and gregarious manner enabled him to form lasting friendships in the cricketing and musical worlds, with among others Newman, Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir Donald Bradman. Cardus spent the Second World War years in Australia, where he wrote for The Sydney Morning Herald and gave regular radio talks. He also wrote books on music, and completed his autobiography. After his return to England he resumed his connection with The Manchester Guardian as its London music critic. He continued to write on cricket, and produced books on both his specialisms. Cardus's work was publicly recognised by his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1964 and the award of a knighthood in 1967, while the music and cricket worlds acknowledged him with numerous honours. In his last years, he became a guru and inspirational figure to aspiring young writers. Early life Family background and early childhood Neville Cardus was born on 2 April 1888 in Rusholme, Manchester.O'Brien, pp. 23‚Äì25 Throughout his childhood and young adulthood he was known as \\"Fred\\".Brookes, p. 3 and pp. 67‚Äì74 There has been confusion over his birth date. The birthdate of 2 April 1888 is as given on his baptism record; and it is 2 April when he celebrated his birthday, albeit believing that he was born in 1889: Cardus himself hosted a dinner party on 2 April 1959 believing this to be his 70th birthday.Hart-Davis: Lyttelton Hart- Davis Letters, Volume 4: letters of 29 March and 5 April 1959, pp. 227 and 230 His birth certificate shows a birthdate of 3 April 1888, but this has been argued to be incorrect, since the date of registration of 15 May 1888 was such that using the birth date of 2 April would have breached the requirement to register a birth in no more than 42 days.O'Brien, p. 24 Some sources give the birthdate as 2 April 1889, Neville's mother was Ada Cardus, one of six daughters of Robert and Ann Cardus of 4 Summer Place, Rusholme. On 14 July 1888, when the baby was three months old, Ada married Neville's father, John Frederick Newsham, a blacksmith.O'Brien, pp. 30‚Äì32 Cardus's autobiographical works refer to his father as a violinist in an orchestra, but there is no other evidence for this.O'Brien, pp. 33 Four days after the wedding, Cardus's father left by boat for America, with the intention that Ada followed.O'Brien, p. 32 However, Ada changed her mind and went to live with Eliahoo Joseph, a Turkish merchant and possibly a pimp, with Ada a prostitute.O'Brien, pp. 34‚Äì41 John Frederick Newsham returned to England and divorced Ada in 1899.O'Brien, pp. 34‚Äì37 It was said that within a few years Ada and Neville had returned to her parents' home in Summer Place. Robert Cardus was a retired policeman; Neville referred to him as receiving a small pension,Cardus, Autobiography, p. 13 although a search of police archives found no trace of this.O'Brien, p. 19 The family took in neighbours' washing, and the household income was further supplemented by his daughters' earnings from part-time prostitution. In his autobiographical writings, Cardus refers to his home environment at Summer Place as \\"sordid ... unlettered and unbeautiful\\", yet enlivened by laughter: \\"Humour kept breezing in\\".Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 18‚Äì19 Commentators have suggested that Cardus tended to overstate the deprived aspects of his childhood; his biographer Christopher Brookes asserts that \\"Cardus was the product neither of a slum, nor a cultural desert\\".Brookes, p. 40 Robert Cardus, though uneducated, was not illiterate, and was instrumental in awakening his grandson's literary interests. Theatres, libraries and other cultural facilities were easily accessible from the Cardus home.Brookes, pp. 55‚Äì57 Neville described his formal schooling as limited to five years at the local board school, where the curriculum was basic and the methods of tuition harsh: \\"[T]he boy who showed the faintest sign of freedom of the will was caned\\".Cardus: Second Innings, p. 82 There is, however, doubt as to whether his schooling lasted only five years and whether he attended a board school or a Church of England school.O'Brien, pp. 42‚Äì43 The experience did not curb Neville's intellectual curiosity; at a very young age he was expanding his cultural horizons, through the worlds of reading and of music hall and pantomime. When he was 10 years old he discovered the novels of Dickens;Daniels, p. 10 years later he wrote that there were two classes of person, \\"those who have it in them from birth onwards to appreciate Dickens and those who haven't. The second group should be avoided as soon as detected\\".Cardus: Second Innings, p. 46 His earliest creative writing took the form of a handwritten magazine, The Boy's World, full of articles and stories he had written. He circulated it among his schoolmates, until it was discovered and torn up by an irate teacher.Cardus: Second Innings, pp. 83‚Äì90 Manchester, 1901‚Äì12 Albert Square, Manchester (depicted in 1910 by Adolphe Valette), where Cardus and his self-educated friends met regularly for discussion and debate After Robert Cardus's death in 1900 the family moved several times, eventually breaking up altogether.Brookes, p. 47 Cardus left school in 1901 and took a variety of short-term, unskilled jobs before finding more secure employment as a clerk with Flemings' marine insurance agency.Daniels, pp. 11‚Äì12 He lived for a time with his Aunt Beatrice with whom, according to Brookes, he had at an early age \\"embarked on a lifelong love affair ... In his eyes she could do no wrong\\".Brookes, p. 22 A flamboyant character, Beatrice brought colour into Cardus's life; she encouraged him to read worthwhile books and her memory, Brookes asserts, \\"remained a potent inspirational force\\" throughout his later life as a writer.Brookes, pp. 22 and 42 She also bought him his first cricket bat.Cardus: Autobiography, p. 34 These years were a period of intense self-education. Cardus became an habitu√© of the local libraries, and extended his reading from Dickens to include many of the masters of literature: Fielding, Thackeray, Conrad and‚Äîwith more reservation‚ÄîHardy and Henry James.Daniels, p. 8 In due course he added philosophy and metaphysics to his curriculum; this began with his discovery of George Henry Lewes, which led him on to the works of Kant, Hume, Berkeley and, eventually, Schopenhauer.Brooks, p. 58 He supplemented these studies by attending free lectures at Manchester University,Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 49‚Äì50 and met regularly with a group of like-minded autodidacts at Alexandra Park or, in the winter, at the Lyons caf√© in Albert Square, to discuss and debate for whole afternoons. At first Cardus's schedule of self-improvement was random; eventually he compiled what he called a \\"cultural scheme\\" whereby he devoted a set weekly number of hours to different subjects.Brookes, pp. 61‚Äì62 Victor Trumper, whose batting was placed among \\"all the delights I have known\\" (Autobiography)Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 182‚Äì83 Cardus's interest in music began with the popular tunes sung by his mother and her sisters in the family home. He remembered hearing for the first time the melody of the \\"Vilja\\" song from Franz Leh√°r's operetta The Merry Widow, which \\"curled its way into my heart to stay there for a lifetime\\".Cardus: Second Innings, pp. 100‚Äì02 In April 1907 he was \\"swept ... into the seven seas of music\\" by a performance of Edward German's operetta Tom Jones.Brookes, p. 83 \\"I am unable to explain\\", Cardus wrote many years later, \\"why it should have been left to Edward German‚Äîof all composers‚Äîto release the flood\\".Cardus: Autobiography, p. 53 He began going to the Hall√© Orchestra's concerts at the Free Trade Hall where, on 3 December 1908, he was present at the premiere of Elgar's first symphony, under Hans Richter. He regularly attended the fortnightly concerts at the Royal Manchester College of Music, where students' performances were assessed by the principal, Adolph Brodsky.Brookes, p. 59 As part of his scheme of study, Cardus briefly took singing lessons, his only formal instruction in music.Cardus: Second Innings, p. 122 and Daniels, p. 306 In 1916 Cardus published his first musical article, \\"Bantock and Style in Music\\", in Musical Opinion.O'Brien, p. 90 Alongside his intellectual pursuits Cardus played and followed cricket. As a small boy he had begun to visit Old Trafford Cricket Ground to watch Lancashire matches: \\"The first cricketer I saw was A.C. MacLaren ... I can still see the swing of MacLaren's bat, the great follow- through finishing high and held there with the body poised\\".Cardus: Autobiography, p. 3 In 1902 he saw the Test match against Australia in which Victor Trumper scored a century before lunch and thereby won a permanent place among Cardus's heroes.Brookes, p. 46 Cardus first played cricket on rough waste land close to his home in Rusholme;Brookes, pp. 49‚Äì50 as he matured he developed as an effective medium-paced off break bowler, and for several seasons from 1908 onwards he played as a weekend professional in Manchester league cricket. \\"I am not ashamed to confess that I seldom hesitated, as soon as a batsman came to the crease, to let him have a quick one bang in the penis; after which a quick, simple straight one would invariably remove him from the scene\\". Shrewsbury Shrewsbury School, seen from the River Severn In the spring of 1912, in search of a change from his unrewarding clerical job, Cardus applied for the post of assistant cricket coach at Shrewsbury School, citing his bowling averages in Manchester club cricket.Brookes, p. 64 and Cardus: Autobiography, p. 59 He reasoned that, by living frugally during the Shrewsbury summers, he would be able to finance his winter studies of music and literature.Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 60‚Äì61 His application was successful, and in May 1912 he began his duties. He worked initially under Walter Attewell, a former Nottinghamshire professional, and later under the Yorkshire and England cricketer Ted Wainwright.Brookes, p. 64 Cardus established good working relations with both of these, but identified most closely with Cyril Alington, the school's headmaster: \\"Because of Alington I call myself ... an old Salopian\\".Cardus: Autobiography, p. 81 Alington first detected Cardus's intellectual potential when he found him reading a copy of Gilbert Murray's translation of Euripides's drama Medea.Daniels, p. 15 In August 1914, in addition to his cricketing duties he became Alington's secretary, after the previous incumbent joined the army at the outbreak of war; Cardus was rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight.Brookes, p. 65 and Cardus: Autobiography, p. 81 Cyril Alington in 1908 Cardus did not find his duties at Shrewsbury onerous.Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 71‚Äì72 He made frequent trips to Manchester, for Hall√© concerts or to watch Thomas Beecham conduct at the Manchester Opera House.Brookes, pp. 65‚Äì66 He found time for other work; thus, in the winter of 1913‚Äì14, he was the music critic for the northern edition of The Daily Citizen. This short-lived newspaper was an official organ of the early Labour Party; mainly out of admiration for Bernard Shaw Cardus had joined the Independent Labour Party, but quickly lost interest in socialism: \\"Their creed or system was obviously not to be a means to an end but an end in itself\\".Cardus: Autobiography, p. 45 According to Brookes, the influence of Shrewsbury School affected Cardus to the extent that \\"[t]he playing fields of an English public school were for him a more natural setting than the iconoclastic frenzy of the Lyons caf√© where socialism vied with Richard Strauss for pride of place in the race to modernity\\".Brookes, p. 73 The Daily Citizen paid poorly, and Cardus's association with it ended in April 1914.Daniels, p. 21; O'Brien, pp. 88‚Äì91 Cardus spent his winters in Manchester, studying hard in anticipation of any opportunity for an opening as a music critic, eking out his summer savings by taking temporary clerical work. Around 1916 he met Edith King, an art teacher and amateur actress who became a regular attender at the Lyons caf√© meetings. In the summers, when Cardus returned to Shrewsbury, she kept him informed of musical and cultural events in Manchester.Brookes, p. 68 The Shrewsbury years, which Brookes describes as a \\"magical interlude\\", ended suddenly when, at the end of the 1916 summer, Alington was appointed headmaster of Eton. Initially it seemed likely that Cardus would join him there as his secretary, but Cardus's military exemption was under review; the uncertainty of his position ended the possibility of a post at Eton. He left Shrewsbury in September 1916 with little money, and no immediate prospects of regular work.Daniels, p. 17 Manchester Guardian, 1917‚Äì1940 First years C. P. Scott, editor of The Manchester Guardian from 1872 to 1929 In the winter of 1916‚Äì17 Cardus continued his private studies while working intermittently; among various jobs, he collected insurance premiums for a burial society.Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 89 Early in January 1917 he wrote to C. P. Scott, The Manchester Guardians editor, asking for any available post at the paper, as \\"the means whereby to continue my education\\".Brookes, pp. 78‚Äì79 To bolster his chances he enclosed specimens of his writing.Cardus: Autobiography, p. 91 The result was, first, a temporary unpaid position as Scott's secretary, but in mid-March Scott offered a job on the paper's reporting staff.Brookes, pp. 80‚Äì81 The writer J. B. Priestley later asserted that Cardus, who did not know shorthand, was engaged not as a reporter, but as a \\"writer\\". In Cardus's own account of these years he appears to have been fully engaged in reporters' duties, his lack of shorthand being dismissed by the chief reporter, Haslam Mills, who paraphrased Shakespeare: \\"Some men are born to shorthand, others achieve shorthand, while others have shorthand thrust upon them\\".Cardus, Autobiography, p. 95 Mills advised Cardus to concentrate on style: \\"We can be decorative at times; we can even be amusing. Here, possibly, you will find scope\\".Cardus: Autobiography, p. 96 Within a year Cardus had been moved from the reporters' room to take charge of the paper's \\"Miscellany\\" column. He also resumed the duties of part-time secretary to Scott,Brookes, p. 76 who was at this time over 70, and had edited The Manchester Guardian since 1872.Daniels, p. 26 Despite his years, he struck Cardus as \\"of inexhaustible energy and aliveness\\".Daniels, p. 27 (quoting from Cardus): \\"Fifty years with the Guardian\\" in The Bedside Guardian 15, London, Collins 1966 Scott was a demanding employer, who gave his young writers free rein, but expected in return long hours and total dedication. Driven hard, sometimes to the point of exhaustion, Cardus nevertheless relished these years, and never complained to Scott of weariness.Brookes, pp. 88‚Äì89 Early in 1919 his role changed again, when he was made junior drama critic under the direction of C.E. Montague, the paper's principal theatre critic who had returned from war service with no great desire to continue in the role. Cardus's principal ambitions still lay in the direction of music criticism, though he recognised that this door was closed while Samuel Langford, music critic since 1906, remained in post. In preparation for any opportunity that might arise in that direction, Cardus maintained a daily two-hour study of music or music literature.Cardus: Autobiography, p. 114 Cricket correspondent In the spring of 1919, while recovering from a serious pulmonary condition, Cardus took up a suggestion from his news editor, William Percival Crozier, that he should watch some cricket at Old Trafford and, if he felt able, write reports on a few matches. He had earlier written four articles on cricket for the newspaper.O'Brien, pp. 102‚Äì103. On 19 May 1919 Cardus went to the first day of Lancashire's match with Derbyshire. His first published cricket report, on the following day, showed little sign of his later characteristic style: \\"I simply had no intention of writing on cricket for any length of time; this was a spare-time affair ... and I fitted myself into the idioms and procedures of the sporting writers of 1919\\".Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 127‚Äì28 Scott nonetheless saw a potential, and from the beginning of 1920 Cardus became the paper's regular cricket correspondent, under the by-line \\"Cricketer\\", a position he held for 20 years.Brookes, pp. 89‚Äì90 Cardus's emergence as cricket correspondent was concurrent with another appointment, that of deputy and successor designate to Langford as music critic. In January 1920 Cardus reported on two recitals by the Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing, and apparently impressed Scott with the quality of his notice, although the accuracy of Cardus's summary of events has been questioned.O'Brien, pp. 136‚Äì138. With the succession to Langford assured, and a significant increase in salary, Cardus was happy to devote his summers exclusively to cricket. He remained circumspect about his commitment to the sport: \\"Never have I regarded my cricket as more than a means to an end; that end being always music\\".Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 131‚Äì35 Nevertheless, he developed a style of cricket reporting that quickly lifted him to the forefront of contemporary sports writers. He did this, according to his fellow cricket writer Gerald Howat, by using imagery and metaphor to create \\"a mythology of characters and scenes\\". John Arlott described Cardus as \\"the creat[or] of modern cricket writing\\". The Saffrons, Eastbourne (2007 photograph), scene of Cardus's \\"scoop\\", August 1921 The new sense of financial and professional security was probably instrumental in the decision of Cardus and Edith King to marry, on 17 June 1921.Brookes, pp. 100‚Äì01 The marriage, which lasted until Edith's death 47 years later, was unconventional; the couple led individual lives and rarely lived together, while remaining devoted friends.Brookes, pp. 118‚Äì21 Cardus described his wife as \\"a great spirit and character, born for sisterhood not marriage.\\" From this time onward, Cardus used the forename \\"Neville\\" in place of \\"Fred\\", and adopted the initials \\"N.C.\\" for his music reviews, to distinguish this persona from \\"Cricketer\\". In August 1921 Cardus gained what he termed \\"the only scoop of my career\\", when he reported the unexpected victory by 28 runs of MacLaren's scratch side over the previously unbeaten Australian touring team. The match, at The Saffrons ground at Eastbourne, had attracted little interest from other cricket correspondents, being treated as a foregone conclusion.Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 176‚Äì78 The focus of much of Cardus's cricket writing was the Lancashire side of the inter-war years, and in particular their twice-yearly battles with rivals Yorkshire. His eye was as much on the players and their personalities as on the game, on \\"the match within the match\\",Daniels, p. 53 with the actual scores treated as secondary. Cardus justified this: \\"Do I add up the notes of a Mozart \\"Vivace\\" to evaluate the music?\\"Cardus: Full Score, p. 101 To meet Cardus's requirements, the players were sometimes \\"enlarged\\", notably Emmott Robinson, the veteran Yorkshire all-rounder of the 1920s who through Cardus's pen became \\"the apotheosis of Yorkshire cricket and Yorkshire character\\".Brookes, pp. 108‚Äì09 In the 1930s, Cardus's style became less effusive, as his older heroes were replaced by players with, in his view, less romantic appeal. Bradman was an exception; after his exploits in the England versus Australia Test series of 1930 Cardus described the Australian as \\"an incredible exponent who in himself sums up all the skill and experience that have gone before him ... he has kindled grand bonfires of batsmanship for us\\".Brookes, pp. 126‚Äì27 Selections from Cardus's Manchester Guardian cricket writings were published in a series of books between 1922 and 1937.Brookes, p. 77 Because of financial constraints the paper did not send \\"Cricketer\\" to Australia to cover the \\"Bodyline\\" tour of 1932‚Äì33. Cardus was generally approving of Jardine's controversial bodyline tactics, writing on 5 March 1933: \\"[H]ad [Jardine] been a weak man, all the energy of Larwood [England's premier bowler] might have proved as vain a thing as it did in 1930\\". In 1936‚Äì37, Cardus accompanied the MCC team to Australia;Brookes, pp. 130‚Äì31 otherwise he continued to write on English domestic cricket until the 1939 season was summarily truncated. On 1 September, the day that Germany invaded Poland, Cardus observed the removal of the bust of W. G. Grace from the Lord's pavilion; he was informed by a bystander: \\"That means war\\".Cardus: Autobiography, p. 167 It has been argued that this should be regarded as a good story rather than literal truth: there was no match at Lord's that day, and Cardus was on holiday in Derbyshire.O'Brien, pp. 158‚Äì161 Music critic Sketch by an orchestra member of Hamilton Harty, chief conductor of the Hall√© Orchestra, of whose performances Cardus was often critical Following Langford's death in May 1927, Cardus became The Manchester Guardians chief music critic. For several years he had worked closely with Langford, whose influence on the younger man was equalled only by that of Ernest Newman, Langford's predecessor as the paper's music critic: \\"Langford taught me to feel and translate, while Newman taught me to observe and analyse\\".Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 213‚Äì15 Cardus's fellow-critic Hugo Cole has described his approach as personal rather than academic, based on his own reactions to the music he was hearing, and with a complete independence of judgement. Cardus was, Cole says, \\"the last distinguished music critic never to have received formal musical training ... he was a writer first, and a music critic second\\". Cardus's lack of deference sometimes led to friction, as with Hamilton Harty, chief conductor of the Hall√© Orchestra from 1920. In his reviews of the Hall√© concerts until Harty's departure in 1933, Cardus frequently criticised the conductor's choices and interpretations. On one occasion he observed that Harty's rendering of the adagio in Beethoven's Ninth had broken the world record for slowness, and quoted minutes and seconds.Brookes, pp. 116‚Äì17 Responding to Harty's outraged protests, Cardus threatened to bring an alarm clock to the next performance, \\"less for critical purposes than for those of personal convenience\\".Cardus: Autobiography, p. 222 When Harty left, he was not replaced as chief conductor; the Hall√© employed distinguished visiting conductors such as Beecham, Malcolm Sargent, Pierre Monteux, Adrian Boult and Ernest Ansermet. Cardus considered that a lack of central direction was adversely affecting the orchestra, and his biting criticisms of some performances led to temporarily strained relations.Brookes, pp. 145‚Äì46 Cardus often expressed views contrary to popular and critical opinion. He dismissed Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring as \\"a sophisticated exploitation of primitive rum-ti-tum\\". When Harty introduced Gershwin's symphonic poem An American in Paris into a Hall√© concert, Cardus proposed \\"a 150 per cent [import] tariff against this sort of American dry-goods\\". He professed to think that Sullivan's \\"preoccupation with comic opera, to the neglect of oratorio and symphony\\" was a \\"deplorable\\" loss to English music,Cardus: Autobiography, p. 242 although he also wrote that without Gilbert, nothing of Sullivan's music would have survived. Cardus championed Delius against the consensus of his fellow-critics: \\"His music looks back on days intensely lived through; it knows the pathos of mortal things doomed to fade and vanish\\".Cardus: Ten Composers, p. 152 At the 1929 Delius Festival in London, Cardus briefly met the composer, who thought he looked too young to be The Manchester Guardians music critic, and counselled him: \\"Don't read yourself daft. Trust to y'r emotions\\". Also against the grain of critical opinion, Cardus commended the then unfashionable music of Richard Strauss and Anton Bruckner.Brookes, pp. 138‚Äì39 In 1931 Cardus visited the Salzburg Festival, where he met Beecham and began a friendship which lasted until Sir Thomas's death in 1961‚Äîdespite numerous disagreements. One of Cardus's notices in 1937 so incensed Beecham that he announced he would not conduct any concert at which Cardus was present. Cardus later numbered Beecham, with Elgar and Delius, as \\"one of the three most original spirits known in English music since Purcell\\". The annual Salzburg Festival became a highlight of Cardus's musical calendar; in 1936 he saw Toscanini conduct a performance there of Wagner's Die Meistersinger that, he said, \\"will remain in the mind for a lifetime ... Toscanini held us like children listening to a tale told in the chimney corner, lighted by the glow of olden times\\". Cardus's final prewar Salzburg visit was in 1938, just after the German-Austrian Anschluss which led to the withdrawal in protest of many of the Festival's leading figures.Brookes, p. 152 Despite financial incentives from London newspapers, Cardus remained loyal to The Manchester Guardian.Hart- Davis: The Essential Neville Cardus p. 13 On the outbreak of war in September 1939 the Free Trade Hall closed, requisitioned for military purposes. The Hall√© Society left Manchester to tour with Sargent around the north-west of England.Brookes, pp. 156‚Äì57 With no music in Manchester and all first-class cricket suspended, Cardus was unemployed, \\"imprisoned in Manchester, useless to anybody\\". Thus, when he received an offer from Sir Keith Murdoch to join The Herald of Melbourne in Australia, he accepted immediately.Cardus: Second Innings, p. 223 Australia In Australia, Cardus developed friendships with C. B. Fry, Sir Thomas Beecham and Donald Bradman. Cardus had been known to Australian readers since the 1920s, when The Argus in Melbourne reported his view that Australians made cricket \\"a war game ... with an intensity of purpose too deadly for a mere game.\\" His books on cricket were widely reviewed in the Australian press in the 1920s and 30s; one critic commented in 1929, \\"Mr. Cardus mingles fancy with fact. The latter is preferable.\\" Another Australian writer, quoting him extensively in 1932, observed, \\"Mr. Cardus is a gifted writer and a most impartial critic.\\" By 1936 he was known to a considerable section of the Australian public as a cricket writer, although he was hardly known there in his musical capacity. The 1936‚Äì37 MCC tour of Australia under G.O. Allen was the occasion of Cardus's first visit to the country.Brookes, p. 128 During the tour he made, or consolidated, friendships with players and colleagues including C. B. Fry and Donald Bradman. Fry, a former England cricket captain, was a boyhood hero of Cardus, and was covering the Tests for the London Evening Standard.Wilton, p. 376 In Bradman, Cardus found a sophistication and sensitivity that other writers had failed to detect.Brookes, pp. 128‚Äì31 and Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 150‚Äì51 When interviewed on his arrival in Australia, Cardus speculated how he would cope for the six months of the tour without music; he was touched when the following day music students in Perth gave him a private recital of music by Chopin and Hugo Wolf. During this tour Cardus wrote for The Herald in Melbourne, and broadcast about cricket on Australian radio. Cardus made a private visit to Australia from mid-January to mid-March 1938. When he joined The Herald in 1940, his initial brief was to cover a series of concerts conducted by Beecham for the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). Daily contact between the two men during Beecham's time in Australia between June and October 1940 helped to consolidate their friendship.Cardus: Sir Thomas Beecham, pp. 17‚Äì19, 48 and 52 At the end of his tour Beecham tried to persuade Cardus to join him in sailing to America, asking, \\"Do you propose to stay in this barbarous country all your life?\\"Cardus: Sir Thomas Beecham, p. 57 Cardus insisted on remaining in Australia, but moved from Melbourne to Sydney. Concluding that he could not satisfactorily review concerts for an evening newspaper, he joined the staff of The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH). At first Cardus failed to adjust his expectations to the prevailing standard of music- making in Australia, which was not at that time comparable to the best on offer in Europe or America. He was accused of being \\"just one more sneering Pommy bastard come to hand down higher wisdom to the ignorant colonials.\\"Brookes, p. 158 His biographer Christopher Brookes suggests that Cardus was applying critical standards \\"more appropriate to Salzburg than to Sydney\\".Brookes, p. 160 Over the next two years Cardus and the public slowly came to terms with each other, and by 1942 he was both popular and respected among Australians.Brookes, p. 162 For ABC Cardus presented a weekly hour-long programme, \\"The Enjoyment of Music\\", which enlarged the audience for classical music across the country. His topics included concert works, such as the late Beethoven string quartets and Mahler's Ninth Symphony, operas including The Marriage of Figaro and Der Rosenkavalier, and performers such as Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler and Arturo Toscanini. He also gave a weekly, fifteen-minute talk on music, illustrated by records, for the children's Argonauts Club programme and regularly wrote for ABC Weekly.Brookes, p. 164 Cardus rented a small flat in the Kings Cross district of Sydney, where he wrote his Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). He said later that he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial.Cardus: Second Innings, p. 225 After his wife announced her intention of sailing from England in 1941 to join him,O'Brien, p. 175. Cardus declined to move to a larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.Brookes, pp. 169 and 171 By the end of the war Cardus's thoughts were turning to England. Refusing an offer of a highly paid permanent contract to cover both music and cricket for the SMH he considered his options; with some reluctance he agreed to cover the MCC's 1946‚Äì47 tour of Australia for the SMH and also for The Times and The Manchester Guardian.Brookes, pp. 175‚Äì76 and 178 The novelist Charles Morgan wrote of Cardus's reports, \\"the best [I have] read these 40 years. Who shall dare to say now that George Meredith is forgotten?\\" Later career Years of uncertainty In April 1947 Cardus returned to England. He had not as yet decided to leave Australia permanently, but \\"felt in need of spiritual refreshment\\".Cardus: Second Innings, p. 238 He found a war-weary England in which much had changed; familiar landmarks had disappeared, and old friends and acquaintances had died. The Free Trade Hall was a burnt-out shell, and the Queen's Hall in London completely destroyed; however, Cardus was struck by the apparent good health of the English music scene. He also found an undamaged Lord's, and enjoyed a season of magnificent cricket, marked by the batting exploits of the Middlesex pair, Denis Compton and Bill Edrich.Brookes, pp. 182‚Äì84 Cardus was back in Sydney by the end of the year, but early in 1948, having accepted an offer from The Sunday Times to cover that year's Test series against Australia, he left for England again.Cardus: Full Score, pp. 198‚Äì99 Another factor that brought Cardus to England in 1948 was the prospect of succeeding Newman, whose retirement as chief music critic of The Sunday Times was assumed to be imminent. However, Newman had no intention of retiring, and made it clear that he would resent any successor-designate looking over his shoulder.Daniels, p. 270 Feeling slighted, Cardus resigned from the paper and accepted an offer from the London Evening Standard to be its music critic. This new appointment was short-lived; Cardus's lengthy and discursive concert reviews were incompatible with this paper's style, and were ruthlessly cut by subeditors. At the end of 1948 he was back in Australia, proclaiming his intention to settle there permanently. This determination, too, was brief; the lure of London life proved irresistible. Because of the commercial success of his Autobiography, published in 1947, and the immediate commissioning of a second autobiographical work, Cardus was not under immediate financial pressure.Cardus: Full Score, p. 194 He left Australia again in the spring of 1949, and although he spent the English winter of 1950‚Äì51 in Australia, writing about the 1950‚Äì51 England v. Australia Test series for the Sydney Morning Herald,Brookes, pp. 228‚Äì30 London was thereafter his permanent home.Brookes, pp. 193‚Äì94 Here he worked as a freelance writer, in which role he resumed his association with The Manchester Guardian. In December 1951 he was appointed the paper's London music critic, on a permanent salaried basis. London critic Cardus vigorously promoted the music of Gustav Mahler (pictured) through the 1950s and 1960s In 1949 Cardus set up his London home at the National Liberal Club, while Edith took a flat in Bickenhall Mansions, just off Baker Street. The pair lived harmoniously apart, though in frequent contact, until Edith's death.Brookes, p. 196 Cardus found London's musical life invigorating, with five major orchestras and a host of distinguished conductors and solo artists performing regularly.Brookes, p. 198 Toscanini paid his final visit to England in 1952, with two concerts at the Royal Festival Hall. Outside London, Cardus was a regular visitor to the Edinburgh Festival and to Glyndebourne, and was in Manchester for the reopening of the Free Trade Hall and the \\"homecoming\\" of the Hall√© Orchestra in November 1951. The inaugural concert concluded with Kathleen Ferrier singing \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\".Brookes, p. 222 Cardus had first heard Ferrier at the Edinburgh Festival in 1947;Daniels, pp. 128‚Äì29 he became a devoted admirer to the extent that, eventually, questions were raised about his critical blindness to her technical weaknesses.Brookes, pp. 226‚Äì27 He wrote of her singing that it was, \\"like the woman herself ... imbued with a quiet but reliant sense and a feeling for the fun and goodness of life\\".Cardus (ed.): Kathleen Ferrier, p. 33 He was devastated by her death from cancer in October 1953; the following year he edited and contributed to a memorial volume of tributes. For The Manchester Guardian, Cardus wrote around 30 music articles a year. These included \\"survey\\" pieces, which often reflected his personal enthusiasms; a regular subject was the music of Gustav Mahler, who in the early 1950s was by no means a popular composer with British audiences. Cardus sought to change that, with a series of articles between 1952 and 1957 under titles such as \\"Mahler's Growing Influence\\", \\"Misunderstanding Mahler\\", and \\"The Mahler Problem\\". He wrote the first volume of a detailed analysis entitled Gustav Mahler: His Mind and his Music; the book, dealing with Mahler's first five symphonies, was published in 1965, but was poorly received by critics. Volume II was never written.Brookes, pp. 204‚Äì05 and 234 Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Cardus wrote cricket articles; these included an annual reflection for Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and occasional columns for The Manchester Guardian, for whom he covered the 1953 Test Matches against Australia. In the English winter of 1954‚Äì55 Cardus made his final visit to Australia, to report on the Test series for The Sydney Morning Herald; he undertook to write \\"impressions\\" rather than day-to-day reports on play. He found time to enjoy Sydney's theatrical and music scene, but was disappointed in what he perceived as a decline in the city's musical standards.Brookes, pp. 231‚Äì32 In the decades after the war many of Cardus's earlier heroes and acquaintances died. On Fry's death in 1956 Cardus wrote of him as \\"A great Englishman, measured by any standards of occupation, art and civilisation\\".Cardus: Full Score, p. 119 In 1959, still in harness, Newman died at the age of 90; Cardus considered him the most outstanding of all music critics, and thought he should have been appointed a Companion of Honour (CH), or even to the Order of Merit.Brookes, pp. 242‚Äì45 Beecham died on 8 March 1961. Cardus had for some years noted a decline in his old friend's powers,Brookes, pp. 208‚Äì09 though he had written in 1954, on the occasion of Beecham's 75th birthday, of the debt the music world owed to the conductor: \\"He led us out of the Teutonic captivity. He showed us other and more sensitive worlds\\". After Beecham's death, Cardus organised the publication of a celebratory memoir, as he had done with Kathleen Ferrier. To an extent the departed idols were replaced with new heroes: in music, Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer, Clifford Curzon and Claudio Arrau;Brookes, p. 212 in cricket, Keith Miller and Garfield Sobers.Daniels, pp. 271 and 327 Cardus maintained a keen antagonism towards much of contemporary music; discussing Pierre Boulez's Pli selon pli after a performance in 1965, he said he \\"could not relate the varied succession of aural phenomena to music as my musical intelligence and senses recognise music\\".Brookes, pp. 213‚Äì14 In 1964 Cardus was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In a letter to his friend Marjorie Robinson he described the investiture at Buckingham Palace, remarking that the Queen \\"might have been any nice shy young lady in D.H. Evans or Kendal Milnes\\". Just over two years later Cardus was awarded a knighthood, the first music critic to receive such an honour, although in all likelihood it was awarded as much for his cricket writing.Daniels, p. 361 Years previously Beecham had advised: \\"In the unlikely event of you being offered a knighthood, Neville, take it. It makes tables at the Savoy so much easier to come by\\". Final years Edith Cardus died on 26 March 1968. Despite their separate day-to-day lives, she had been an influential presence for nearly all Cardus's adult life; they had communicated by telephone almost daily, and he felt her loss keenly. After her death he left the National Liberal Club and moved into her flat, which remained his base for the rest of his life.Brookes, pp. 250‚Äì51 In the ensuing months he worried about his deteriorating relationship with The Guardian; the paper had been renamed in 1959 following reorganisation, and its editorial offices had moved to London in 1964. Cardus felt that much of the old ethos had departed, and that his once-sacrosanct copy was now at the mercy of subeditors.Brookes, p. 252 He was particularly incensed by the treatment meted out to his 1969 Edinburgh Festival reports, and referred to the subeditors' room as \\"the Abattoir\\" in one of many letters complaining of editorial butchery.Brookes, pp. 257‚Äì58 As well as his work for The Guardian Cardus wrote occasionally for The Sunday Times, a particular pleasure to him in view of his failure to achieve Newman's post.Daniels, p. 271 In 1970 he published Full Score, the last of his autobiographical works and, in Daniels's view, the least substantial of all the Cardus books.Daniels, pp. 268‚Äì69 In his eighties, Cardus assumed the role of guru to young aspiring writers, before whom he would hold court in favourite locations: the Garrick Club, the National Liberal Club, or Lord's. According to Daniels, Cardus \\"thrived in the role of patron, encourager, [and] accoucheur\\". Howat describes his appearance in these years as not having changed much from his younger days: \\"... the lean, ascetic figure of moderate height, with sharp features, sleek hair, and strong glasses\\". Cardus died on 28 February 1975 at the Nuffield Clinic, London, a few days after collapsing at home. His cremation service was private. On 4 April more than 200 people attended a memorial service at St Paul's, Covent Garden. These included representatives from Cardus's worlds of cricket, journalism and music. Flora Robson and Wendy Hiller gave readings, and Clifford Curzon, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, played the second movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23.Brookes, p. 263 The eulogy was given by the cricket writer and historian Alan Gibson, who took as his text verses from Blake's Auguries of Innocence: Reputation, honours and influence Cardus's contribution to cricket writing has been acknowledged by various commentators on the game. John Arlott wrote: \\"Before him, cricket was reported ... with him it was for the first time appreciated, felt, and imaginatively described.\\" Howat commented: \\"He would have his imitators and parodists, and no serious cricket writer would remain unaffected by him\\". His influence on his successors was more specifically acknowledged by Gibson: > \\"All cricket writers of the last half century have been influenced by > Cardus, whether they admit it or not, whether they have wished to be or not, > whether they have tried to copy him or tried to avoid copying him. He was > not a model, any more than Macaulay, say, was a model for the aspiring > historian. But just as Macaulay changed the course of the writing of > history, Cardus changed the course of the writing of cricket. He showed what > could be done. He dignified and illuminated the craft\\". As a music critic, Cardus's romantic, instinctive approach was the opposite of Newman's objective school of musical criticism. Initially in awe of Newman's reputation, Cardus soon discovered his own independent, more subjective voice.Daniels, pp. 99‚Äì100 A fellow critic wrote that Newman \\"probed into Music's vitals, put her head under deep X-ray and analysed cell-tissue. Cardus laid his head against her bosom and listened to the beating of her heart.\\"Brookes, p. 137 Despite their different approaches, the two writers held each other in considerable regard; at times, Newman's own prose showed the influence of Cardus's style. Among leading musicians who have paid tribute to Cardus, Yehudi Menuhin wrote that he \\"reminds us that there is an understanding of the heart as well as of the mind ... in Neville Cardus, the artist has an ally\\". Colin Davis highlighted \\"the quality and verve of Cardus's writing\\", which had made him a household name.Daniels, p. xix Beside his CBE and knighthood, Cardus received numerous honours from the musical and cricketing worlds, at home and overseas. In 1963 he was awarded the City of Bayreuth's Wagner Medal; he was given honorary membership of the Royal Manchester College of Music in 1968, and of the Royal Academy of Music in 1972. The Hall√© Orchestra honoured him with two special concerts in April 1966 to mark his long association with the orchestra. In 1970 he received the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class. Among the honours he most valued was the presidency, for two years, of Lancashire County Cricket Club, which he accepted in 1971.Brookes, p. 245 Cardus was not an \\"establishment\\" figure. His friends encountered initial resistance when they sought his election to the MCC, although he was eventually accepted in 1958.Brookes, pp. 200‚Äì01 He was denied the civic honour of the Freedom of the City of Manchester, and although he made light of this omission he was hurt by it. Long after his death, the city named a pathway close to the rebuilt Summer Place \\"Neville Cardus Walk\\". Aside from formal institutional recognition, Cardus was highly regarded by prominent individual cricketers and musicians, as indicated by the \\"tribute book\\" he received at his 70th birthday celebration lunch. The book included contributions from Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs and Len Hutton, and also from Klemperer, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Bruno Walter. He managed to maintain close friendships with both Beecham and Sir John Barbirolli, though the two conductors cordially disliked one another.Lucas, pp. 308‚Äì10 In the conventional sense, Cardus was not a religious man; Dennis Silk, a one-time MCC president, suggests that Cardus's religion was \\"friendship\\".Daniels, p. xxii In Autobiography Cardus says he found his Kingdom of Heaven in the arts, \\"the only religion that is real and, once found, omnipresent\\"‚Äîthough his rationalism was shaken, he confesses, when he came to understand the late string quartets of Beethoven. He ends his autobiography by declaring: \\"If I know that my Redeemer liveth it is not on the church's testimony, but because of what Handel affirms\\".Cardus: Autobiography, p. 281 Within the relaxed framework of his marriage, Cardus enjoyed relationships with many women. These included Hilda \\"Barbe\\" Ede, with whom he shared a passionate affair in the 1930s before her sudden death in 1937;Brookes, pp. 123‚Äì25 Cardus referred to her as \\"Milady\\", and devoted a chapter of Full Score to her.Cardus: Full Score, pp. 67‚Äì74 After his return from Australia his closest women friends were Margaret Hughes and Else Mayer- Lismann, to whom he referred respectively as his \\"cricket wife\\" and his \\"music wife\\". Hughes, who was more than 30 years younger than Cardus, became his literary executor after his death, and edited several collections of his cricketing and musical writings.

In this example, the domain D is the inner circle and the domain E is the square. Because the square's area (4) can be easily calculated, the area of the circle (œÄ*1.02) can be estimated by the ratio (0.8) of the points inside the circle (40) to the total number of points (50), yielding an approximation for the circle's area of 4*0.8 = 3.2 ‚âà œÄ. In mathematics, Monte Carlo integration is a technique for numerical integration using random numbers. It is a particular Monte Carlo method that numerically computes a definite integral. While other algorithms usually evaluate the integrand at a regular grid,Press et al, 2007, Chap. 4. Monte Carlo randomly chooses points at which the integrand is evaluated.Press et al, 2007, Chap. 7. This method is particularly useful for higher-dimensional integrals. There are different methods to perform a Monte Carlo integration, such as uniform sampling, stratified sampling, importance sampling, sequential Monte Carlo (also known as a particle filter), and mean field particle methods.  Overview  In numerical integration, methods such as the trapezoidal rule use a deterministic approach. Monte Carlo integration, on the other hand, employs a non-deterministic approach: each realization provides a different outcome. In Monte Carlo, the final outcome is an approximation of the correct value with respective error bars, and the correct value is likely to be within those error bars. The problem Monte Carlo integration addresses the computation of a multidimensional definite integral :I = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega}f(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}) \\\\, d\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}} where Œ©, a subset of Rm, has volume :V = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega}d\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}} The naive Monte Carlo approach is to sample points uniformly on Œ©:Newman, 1999, Chap. 1. given N uniform samples, :\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}_1, \\\\cdots, \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}_N\\\\in \\\\Omega, I can be approximated by : I \\\\approx Q_N \\\\equiv V \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N f(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}_i) = V \\\\langle f\\\\rangle. This is because the law of large numbers ensures that : \\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} Q_N = I. Given the estimation of I from QN, the error bars of QN can be estimated by the sample variance using the unbiased estimate of the variance. : \\\\mathrm{Var}(f)\\\\equiv\\\\sigma_N^2 = \\\\frac{1}{N-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\left (f(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}_i) - \\\\langle f \\\\rangle \\\\right )^2. which leads to : \\\\mathrm{Var}(Q_N) = \\\\frac{V^2}{N^2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mathrm{Var}(f) = V^2\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Var}(f)}{N} = V^2\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_N^2}{N}. As long as the sequence : \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sigma_1^2, \\\\sigma_2^2, \\\\sigma_3^2, \\\\ldots \\\\right \\\\\\\\} is bounded, this variance decreases asymptotically to zero as 1/N. The estimation of the error of QN is thus :\\\\delta Q_N\\\\approx\\\\sqrt{\\\\mathrm{Var}(Q_N)}=V\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_N}{\\\\sqrt{N}}, which decreases as \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N}}. This is standard error of the mean multiplied with V. This result does not depend on the number of dimensions of the integral, which is the promised advantage of Monte Carlo integration against most deterministic methods that depend exponentially on the dimension.Press et al, 2007 It is important to notice that, unlike in deterministic methods, the estimate of the error is not a strict error bound; random sampling may not uncover all the important features of the integrand that can result in an underestimate of the error. While the naive Monte Carlo works for simple examples, an improvement over deterministic algorithms only can be accomplished with algorithms that use problem specific sampling distributions. With an appropriate sample distribution it is possible to exploit the fact that almost all higher-dimensional integrands are very localized and only small subspace notably contributes to the integral. A large part of the Monte Carlo literature is dedicated in developing strategies to improve the error estimates. In particular, stratified sampling‚Äîdividing the region in sub- domains‚Äî, and importance sampling‚Äîsampling from non-uniform distributions‚Äîare two of such techniques.  Example  Relative error as a function of the number of samples, showing the scaling \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N}} A paradigmatic example of a Monte Carlo integration is the estimation of œÄ. Consider the function :H\\\\left(x,y\\\\right)=\\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if }x^{2}+y^{2}\\\\leq1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{else} \\\\end{cases} and the set Œ© = [‚àí1,1] √ó [‚àí1,1] with V = 4. Notice that :I_\\\\pi = \\\\int_\\\\Omega H(x,y) dx dy = \\\\pi. Thus, a crude way of calculating the value of œÄ with Monte Carlo integration is to pick N random numbers on Œ© and compute :Q_N = 4 \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N H(x_{i},y_{i}) In the figure on the right, the relative error \\\\tfrac{Q_N-\\\\pi}{\\\\pi} is measured as a function of N, confirming the \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N}}.  C example  Keep in mind that a true random number generator should be used. int i, throws = 99999, insideCircle = 0; double randX, randY, pi; srand(time(NULL)); for (i = 0; i < throws; ++i) { randX = rand() / (double) RAND_MAX; randY = rand() / (double) RAND_MAX; if (randX * randX + randY * randY < 1) ++insideCircle; } pi = 4.0 * insideCircle / throws;  Wolfram Mathematica example  The code below describes a process of integrating the function :f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\sinh(2x)\\\\log(x)^2} from 0.8 using the Monte-Carlo method in Mathematica: func[x_] := 1/(1 + Sinh[2*x]*(Log[x])^2); (*Sample from truncated normal distribution to speed up convergence*) Distrib[x_, average_, var_] := PDF[NormalDistribution[average, var], 1.1*x - 0.1]; n = 10; RV = RandomVariate[TruncatedDistribution[{0.8, 3}, NormalDistribution[1, 0.399 , n]; Int = 1/n Total[func[RV]/Distrib[RV, 1, 0.399 *Integrate[Distrib[x, 1, 0.399], {x, 0.8, 3}] NIntegrate[func[x], {x, 0.8, 3}] (*Compare with real answer*)  Recursive stratified sampling  thumb|right|An illustration of Recursive Stratified Sampling. In this example, the function: f(x,y) = \\\\begin{cases}1 & x^2+y^2<1 \\\\\\\\\\\\0 & x^2+y^2 \\\\ge 1 \\\\end{cases} from the above illustration was integrated within a unit square using the suggested algorithm. The sampled points were recorded and plotted. Clearly stratified sampling algorithm concentrates the points in the regions where the variation of the function is largest. Recursive stratified sampling is a generalization of one-dimensional adaptive quadratures to multi-dimensional integrals. On each recursion step the integral and the error are estimated using a plain Monte Carlo algorithm. If the error estimate is larger than the required accuracy the integration volume is divided into sub-volumes and the procedure is recursively applied to sub-volumes. The ordinary 'dividing by two' strategy does not work for multi-dimensions as the number of sub-volumes grows far too quickly to keep track. Instead one estimates along which dimension a subdivision should bring the most dividends and only subdivides the volume along this dimension. The stratified sampling algorithm concentrates the sampling points in the regions where the variance of the function is largest thus reducing the grand variance and making the sampling more effective, as shown on the illustration. The popular MISER routine implements a similar algorithm.  MISER Monte Carlo  The MISER algorithm is based on recursive stratified sampling. This technique aims to reduce the overall integration error by concentrating integration points in the regions of highest variance.Press, 1990, pp 190-195. The idea of stratified sampling begins with the observation that for two disjoint regions a and b with Monte Carlo estimates of the integral E_a(f) and E_b(f) and variances \\\\sigma_a^2(f) and \\\\sigma_b^2(f), the variance Var(f) of the combined estimate :E(f) = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\left (E_a(f) + E_b(f) \\\\right ) is given by, :\\\\mathrm{Var}(f) = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_a^2(f)}{4 N_a} + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_b^2(f)}{4 N_b} It can be shown that this variance is minimized by distributing the points such that, :\\\\frac{N_a}{N_a + N_b} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_a}{\\\\sigma_a + \\\\sigma_b} Hence the smallest error estimate is obtained by allocating sample points in proportion to the standard deviation of the function in each sub-region. The MISER algorithm proceeds by bisecting the integration region along one coordinate axis to give two sub-regions at each step. The direction is chosen by examining all d possible bisections and selecting the one which will minimize the combined variance of the two sub-regions. The variance in the sub-regions is estimated by sampling with a fraction of the total number of points available to the current step. The same procedure is then repeated recursively for each of the two half-spaces from the best bisection. The remaining sample points are allocated to the sub-regions using the formula for Na and Nb. This recursive allocation of integration points continues down to a user-specified depth where each sub-region is integrated using a plain Monte Carlo estimate. These individual values and their error estimates are then combined upwards to give an overall result and an estimate of its error.  Importance sampling  There are a variety of importance sampling algorithms, such as  Importance sampling algorithm  Importance sampling provides a very important tool to perform Monte-Carlo integration.Newman, 1999, Chap. 2. The main result of importance sampling to this method is that the uniform sampling of \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}} is a particular case of a more generic choice, on which the samples are drawn from any distribution p(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}). The idea is that p(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}) can be chosen to decrease the variance of the measurement QN. Consider the following example where one would like to numerically integrate a gaussian function, centered at 0, with œÉ = 1, from ‚àí1000 to 1000. Naturally, if the samples are drawn uniformly on the interval [‚àí1000, 1000], only a very small part of them would be significant to the integral. This can be improved by choosing a different distribution from where the samples are chosen, for instance by sampling according to a gaussian distribution centered at 0, with œÉ = 1. Of course the \\"right\\" choice strongly depends on the integrand. Formally, given a set of samples chosen from a distribution :p(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}) : \\\\qquad \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}_1, \\\\cdots, \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}_N \\\\in V, the estimator for I is given by : Q_N \\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\frac{f(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}_i)}{p(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}_i)} Intuitively, this says that if we pick a particular sample twice as much as other samples, we weight it half as much as the other samples. This estimator is naturally valid for uniform sampling, the case where p(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}) is constant. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is one of the most used algorithms to generate \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}} from p(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{x}}), thus providing an efficient way of computing integrals.  VEGAS Monte Carlo  The VEGAS algorithm approximates the exact distribution by making a number of passes over the integration region which creates the histogram of the function f. Each histogram is used to define a sampling distribution for the next pass. Asymptotically this procedure converges to the desired distribution.Lepage, 1978 In order to avoid the number of histogram bins growing like Kd, the probability distribution is approximated by a separable function: :g(x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots) = g_1(x_1) g_2(x_2) \\\\ldots so that the number of bins required is only Kd. This is equivalent to locating the peaks of the function from the projections of the integrand onto the coordinate axes. The efficiency of VEGAS depends on the validity of this assumption. It is most efficient when the peaks of the integrand are well-localized. If an integrand can be rewritten in a form which is approximately separable this will increase the efficiency of integration with VEGAS. VEGAS incorporates a number of additional features, and combines both stratified sampling and importance sampling.

He is also the president of American Renaissances parent organization, New Century Foundation, through which many of his books have been published. He is a former member of the advisory board of The Occidental Quarterly and a former director of the National Policy Institute, a Virginia-based white nationalist think tank. He is also a board member and spokesperson of the Council of Conservative Citizens. Taylor and many of his affiliated organizations are accused of promoting racist ideologies by civil rights groups, news media, and academics studying racism in the United States.American Renaissance Southern Poverty Law Center  Early life and education  Taylor was born on September 15, 1951, to Christian missionary parents from Virginia in Kobe, Japan. He lived in Japan until he was 16 years old and attended Japanese schools up to the age of 12, becoming fluent in Japanese in the process. He attended Yale University, where he earned a BA with a major in philosophy in 1973. Taylor then spent three years in France and received an MA degree in international economics at the Paris Institute of Political Studies in 1978.. See the alumni directory of the institution for the date. During a period that interrupted his undergraduate and later graduate college years, he worked and traveled extensively in West Africa, improving his French in the Francophone regions of the continent. Taylor is fluent in French, Japanese, and English. Career Taylor worked as an international lending officer for the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation from 1978 to 1981, and as West Coast editor of PC Magazine from 1983 to 1988. He has also taught Japanese at the Harvard Summer School, and worked as a courtroom translator. In the 1980s, at the time of the country's strong economic growth, Taylor was viewed as a \\"Japan expert\\" in the mainstream media. In 1983 he published a well-received book on Japanese culture and business customs entitled Shadows of the Rising Sun: A Critical View of the Japanese Miracle. While critical of certain aspects of Japanese culture, Taylor argued that Japanese society was more successful in solving social issues than the West, with lower crime rates and a similar or higher standard of living. Sometime in his early thirties, Taylor reassessed the liberal and cosmopolitan viewpoint commonly professed in his working environment, which he had himself shared until then. He became deeply convinced that human beings are tribal in nature and feelings, and that they differ in talent, temperament and capacity. In the mid-1980s, he developed an interest in the emerging fields of evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology, especially in the controversial works of Richard Lynn, J. Philippe Rushton and Helmuth Nyborg, and came to believe that differences between human beings are largely of genetic origin, and therefore quasi-immutable. All the social miracles of Japan, Taylor averred by 1991 under the pen name Steven Howell, were at least partly a result of Japan's racial and cultural homogeneity. See Howell, Steven (October 1991). \\"The Case of Japan (Part II)\\". American Renaissance: \\"Japanese society is a perfect example of the advantages of ethnic homogeneity.\\" In November 1990, he founded and published the first issue of American Renaissance, a white supremacist subscription-based monthly newsletter. He created the New Century Foundation in 1994 to assist with the running of American Renaissance. Many of the early articles were written by Taylor himself and were intended to put white racial advocacy on a higher intellectual level than the traditional Klansman's or white skinhead's discourse that dominated the media at that time. The journal ceased its print publication in 2012 to focus on a daily webzine format. In 1992, Taylor published a book titled Paved with Good Intentions in which he criticizes what he deems the unwise welfare politics that contributed to the economic situation of the African-American underclass. Unlike many of his American Renaissance articles, the work avoids genetic-based reasoning due to fears of not being able to get it published had he talked about IQ differences.; . In 1994, he was called by the defense team in a Fort Worth, Texas black-on-black murder trial, to give expert testimony on the race-related aspects of the case. Prior to testifying in the trial, Taylor, presented as a \\"race-relations expert and author\\" by the Washington Post, called young black men \\"the most dangerous people in America\\" and added \\"This must be taken into consideration in judging whether or not it was realistic for [the defendant] to think this was a kill-or-be-killed situation.\\" Views Taylor has been described as a white nationalist, *Leonard Zeskind, Blood and Politics: The History of the White Nationalist Movement from the Margins to the Mainstream (Farrar, Straud and Giroux, 2009), p. 370 & 427: \\"Taylor began his public foray into the white nationalist arena with a newsletter he edited called American Renaissance... Taylor, by eschewing conspiracy mongering and what they called 'paramilitary infantilism,' gave white nationalism greater potential access to the conservative mainstream.\\" *Roxanne Lynn Doty, The Law Into Their Own Hands: Immigration and the Politics of Exceptionalism (University of Arizona Press, 2009), p. 61: \\"One of the more prominent members of the new white nationalism is Jared Taylor, editor of American Renaissance.\\" *Carol M. Swain, The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration (Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 121: \\"White nationalist Jared Taylor had this to say...\\" *Eric J. Sundquist, King's Dream (Yale University Press, 2009), p. 79: \\"the white nationalist Jared Taylor\\" white supremacist, and racist by civil rights groups, news media, academics studying racism in the US, and others. Taylor has \\"strenuously rejected\\" being called a racist, and maintains that he is instead a \\"racialist who believes in race-realism.\\" He has also disputed the white supremacist label, preferring to describe himself as a \\"white advocate\\", and contends that his views on nationality and race are \\"moderate, commonsensical, and fully consistent with the views of most of the great statesmen and presidents of America's past\\". Taylor has said he does not know what \\"white nationalist\\" means.https://www.amren.com/news/2010/07/race_realist_ja/ News coverage of Taylor has associated him with the alt-right. Race Taylor is a proponent of scientific racism and voluntary racial segregation. Taylor also asserts that there are racial differences in intelligence among the various ethno- racial groups across the world. Taylor argues that Blacks are generally less intelligent than Hispanics, while Hispanics are generally less intelligent than whites, and whites are generally less intelligent than East Asians: \\"I think Asians are objectively superior to Whites by just about any measure that you can come up with in terms of what are the ingredients for a successful society. This doesn't mean that I want America to become Asian. I think every people has a right to be itself, and this becomes clear whether we're talking about Irian Jaya or Tibet, for that matter\\". Taylor describes himself as an advocate for white interests.. He states that his publication, American Renaissance, was founded to provide a voice for such concerns, and argues that its work is analogous to other groups that advocate for ethnic or racial interests.. American Renaissance, however, has been described as a white supremacist publication and a \\"forum for writers disparaging the abilities of minorities\\". In the journal in 2005, he stated, \\"Blacks and whites are different. When blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western civilization any kind of civilization disappears.\\" A 2005 feature in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described Taylor as \\"a racist in the guise of expert\\".\\"Jared Taylor, a Racist in the Guise of 'Expert'\\". Dennis Roddy. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. January 23, 2005. Taylor describes his segregationist project as based on civil liberties and freedom of association. Taylor has described government-mandated segregation as morally unjust. He believes that all anti-discrimination laws \\"from the Civil Rights Act of 1964 onward\\" are an unacceptable expansion of federal power. Taylor also opposes anti- miscegenation laws as impinging on the freedom of association of private citizens.. Taylor believes that the multi-racial American society is \\"doomed to failure\\", and that non-white groups should not constitute a significant part of the American population, especially Hispanics, Africans, Afro- Caribbeans and Middle Easterners, although he also includes Northern Asians, who he holds in high regard. He thus supports immigration policies that would favor white immigrants over other groups. Taylor has said: \\"Whites deserve a homeland,\\" and when questioned about the US immigration laws passed in 1965, under the Hart-Celler Act, said that \\"Whites are making a terrible mistake by setting in motion forces that will reduce them to a minority.\\"Jared Taylor, in an interview with ABC News' Amna Nawaz, on 26 March 2017; Jared Taylor, ABC Interview 2017. Taylor supports the white genocide conspiracy theory, and has hosted the Suidlanders on his AmRen podcast to discuss the topic, while encouraging donations to the South African organisation. He has recommended Jean Raspail's The Camp of the Saints to his followers. Judaism and anti- Semitism Taylor welcomes Jews to his organization and views American Jews as potential powerful allies. He has never sought to either welcome or expel anti-Semitic voices, and several speakers of Jewish descent have participated in American Renaissance conventions. This position has sparked tensions with far-right anti-Semitic organizations claiming that Jews are infiltrating their movements. In 2006, a clash erupted at one convention between anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist David Duke and Michael Hart, a Jewish astrophysicist sharing many of Taylor's ideas.; citing Smith 2009. The Forward reported that Taylor \\"has been trying to de-Nazify the movement and draw the white nationalist circle wider to include Jews of European descent. But to many on the far right, taking the Jew-hatred out of white nationalism is like taking the Christ out of Christmas ‚Äî a sacrilege.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) comments that Taylor is unusual among the radical right in \\"his lack of anti-Semitism.\\" Scholar Kathleen R. Arnold states that \\"unlike many other white supremacists, Taylor is not anti-Semitic, and in fact encourages Jews to join his fight...however many within the white supremacist/anti-immigration movement disagree with Taylor..... and he has been under tremendous pressure to break ties with the Jewish community.\\" Donald Trump Taylor supported Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and recorded robocalls to support Trump before the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. Taylor attended Trump's inauguration with front-row VIP tickets, and he described the event as \\"a sign of rising white consciousness\\". A spokesperson told CNN that the candidate \\"disavows all super PACs offering their support and continues to do so.\\" When asked about the robocalls in an interview with CNN, Trump responded \\"I would disavow that, but I will tell you people are extremely angry.\\"  Influence  Madison Grant, the author of The Passing of the Great Race (1916), and Lothrop Stoddard, the author of The Rising Tide of Color (1920), each the object of celebratory articles in American Renaissance, seem to have influenced or reinforced Taylor's belief in separate racial homelands. Southern conservatives Samuel Francis and Sam Dickson, who have been regular speakers at American Renaissance conferences, are also cited as influential on Taylor's views. According to scholar Russell Nieli, \\"the combination of southern regional conservatism and Taylor's experience of living in (...) Japan has undoubtedly had a formative effect on his thinking about race.\\" Hoping his ethnonationalist project will go global, Taylor has sought in recent years to establish relations with populist radical right parties in Europe such as France's National Rally, Britain's UKIP, Austria's Freedom Party, Germany's Alternativ f√ºr Deutschland, and Flanders's Vlaams Belang. Nieli notes that Taylor appears to have a special intellectual affinity for the French New Right author Guillaume Faye, whose books were favorably reviewed by Taylor in American Renaissance; both of them believe that white people need to join in a worldwide fight for their racial, cultural, and demographic survival. According to Nieli, Taylor \\"may well have been as central to structuring the fledgling [America's radical Right] in the 1990s as the late William F. Buckley Jr. was in the 1950s and 1960s in structuring post-World War II American conservatism. The growing Alt Right movement in America today owes a great deal to Taylor's past efforts.\\" Reception The Southern Poverty Law Center describes Taylor as \\"a courtly presenter of ideas that most would describe as crudely white supremacist‚Äîa kind of modern-day version of the refined but racist colonialist of old.\\" Mark Potok and Heidi Beirich, writers for the Intelligence Report (a publication of the SPLC), have written that \\"Jared Taylor is the cultivated, cosmopolitan face of white supremacy. He is the guy who is providing the intellectual heft, in effect, to modern-day Klansmen.\\" They have also stated that \\"American Renaissance has become increasingly important over the years, bringing a measure of intellectualism and seriousness to the typically thug-dominated world of white supremacy\\". On December 18, 2017, his account (as well as the account for American Renaissance) was suspended by Twitter, after Twitter adopted new rules prohibiting accounts affiliated with the promotion of violence. In February 2018, Taylor filed a lawsuit against Twitter, claiming that the suspension violated his right to free speech.

It was created in 1549 by Spain in the area around the R√≠o de la Plata. It was at first simply a renaming of the New Andalusia Governorate and included all of the land between 470 and 670 leagues south of the mouth of the R√≠o Santiago along the Pacific coast. After 1617, Paraguay was separated under a separate administration (Asunci√≥n had been the capital of the governorate since Juan de Ayolas.) After the founding of the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1542, the governorate was since its birth under its authority until the formation of the independent Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata in 1776. Similarly, it was under the jurisdiction of the Royal Audience of Charcas until the formation of the independent Royal Audience of Buenos Aires from 1661 to 1671 and after 1783.

Vla is available in many different flavors of which vanilla is most popular. Other flavors include chocolate, caramel, banana, orange and apple.Vla flavors of market leader Campina. Vla was originally sold in glass bottles and the consistency made extracting the complete amount difficult, so a special bottle scraper (flessenschraper or flessenlikker) was specifically designed. Despite the fact that vla is now normally sold in cartons, these scrapers are still common in Dutch family kitchens. Although vla is originally a typical Dutch product, it has also been introduced to Wallonia and Germany by Campina since 2010.

Cutting bit rotation speeds on metal working equipment is typically too slow to produce good results in wood. Typical wood piece before router cutting Typical work done by a CNC wood router A CNC wood router is a CNC router tool that creates objects from wood. CNC stands for computer numerical control. The CNC works on the Cartesian coordinate system (X, Y, Z) for 3D motion control. Parts of a project can be designed in the computer with a CAD/CAM program, and then cut automatically using a router or other cutters to produce a finished part. The CNC router is ideal for hobbies, engineering prototyping, product development, art, and production work.  Operation  A CNC wood router uses CNC (computer numerical control) and is similar to a metal CNC mill with the following differences: *The wood router typically spins faster -- with a range of 13,000 to 24,000 RPM *Professional quality machines frequently use surface facing tools up to 3\\" in diameter or more, and spindle power from 5 to 15 horsepower. Machines capable of routing heavy material at over a thousand inches per minute are common. *Some machines use smaller toolholders MK2 (Morse taper #2 - on older machines), ISO-30, HSK-63 or the tools just get held in a collet tool holder affixed directly to the spindle nose. ISO-30 and HSK-63 are rapid-change toolholding systems. HSK-63 has begun to supplant the ISO-30 as the rapid change standard in recent years. A wood router is controlled in the same way as a metal mill, but there are CAM and CAD applications such as Artcam, Mastercam, Bobcad, and AlphaCam, which are specifically designed for use with wood routers. Wood routers are frequently used to machine other soft materials such as plastics. Typical three-axis CNC wood routers are generally much bigger than their metal shop counterparts. 5' x 5', 4' x 8', and 5' x 10' are typical bed sizes for wood routers. They can be built to accommodate very large sizes up to, but not limited to 12' x 100'. The table can move, allowing for true three axis (xyz) motion, or the gantry can move, which requires the third axis to be controlled by two slaved servo motors.  Advantages  The advantages of CNC wood router (compared to general machine) as follows, * High degree of automation * Consistent quality * High productivity * Processing complex shape * Easy to implement CAD/CAM *2D, 2.5D and 3D capable  Components   Separate heads  Some wood routers have multiple separate heads that can come down simultaneously or not. Some routers have multiple heads that can run complete separate programs on separate tables all while being controlled by the same interface.  Dust collection / vacuum collector A CNC router with brushes to prevent chips and dust escaping The wood router typically has 6\\"-10\\" air ducts to suck up the wood chips and dust created. They can be piped to a stand-alone or full shop dust collection system. Some wood routers are specialized for cabinetry and have many drills that can be programmed to come down separately or together. The drills are generally spaced 32 mm apart on centres - a spacing system called 32 mm System. This is for the proper spacing of shelving for cabinets. Drilling can be vertical or horizontal (in the Y or X axis from either side/end of the workpiece) which allows a panel to be drilled on all four edges as well as the top surface. Many of these machines with large drilling arrays are derived from CNC point-to-point borers.  Securing the workpiece   Suction systems  A typical CNC wood router with suction holes visible The wood router typically holds wood with suction through the table or pods that raise the work above the table. Pods may be used for components which require edge profiling (or undercutting), are manufactured from solid wood or where greater flexibility in production is required. This type of bed requires less extraction with greater absolute vacuum. A second type hold down uses a spoil board. This allows vacuum suction through a low density table and allows the placement of parts anywhere on the table. These types of tables are typically used for nest-based manufacturing (NBM) where multiple components are routed from a single sheet. This type of manufacturing precludes edge drilling or undercut edge work on components. Vacuum pumps are required with both types of tables where volume and \\"strength\\" are determined based on the types of materials being cut.  Maintenance  Proper operation and maintenance in right way can greatly extend machine's life and reduce the incidence of failures. * Avoid the direct sunlight, excessive dust and humidity * Keep away from the equipment with high vibration *Keep dust and similar away from wheels and bearings, use compressed air External links Category:Woodworking machines Wood router ","title":"CNC wood router"},{"id":"1112996","text":"Paulo S√©rgio Oliveira da Silva (19 October 1974 ‚Äì 27 October 2004), better known as Serginho, was a Brazilian footballer.

It reaches its highest point at the Kulpenberg with an elevation of . The range is the site of medieval Kyffhausen Castle (Reichsburg Kyffhausen) and the 19th century Kyffh√§user Monument; it has significance in German traditional mythology as the legendary resting place of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Etymology The origin of the name has not been conclusively established. Kyffh√§user (formerly also Kiffh√§user) probably stems from the Low German word cuf, meaning \\"head\\" or \\"peak\\", and huse, \\"house\\". Other explanations refer to kiff, \\"quarrel\\" and the historic castles at the site. Geography Map of the Kyffh√§user range (about 1913) The Kyffh√§user is a small Mittelgebirge located in the Kyffh√§userkreis district of Thuringia and the Mansfeld-S√ºdharz district of Saxony-Anhalt, not far from the larger Harz range to the northwest. The range has a length of , from west to east, and a width of . The highest point at the Kulpenberg, with the Kulpenburg TV tower, is located near the village of Steinthaleben in Thuringia. The range borders on the Hainleite hill chain and the fertile Goldene Aue basin in the south. Large portions are protected as a nature park. Some parts of the range on the western and southern slopes are karstified and bare of trees, covered by calcareous grassland. The area shaped by numerous sandstone quarries today is the site of a geopark, comprising the Kyffh√§user Monument, the Barbarossa Cave near Rottleben, the Kaiserpfalz at Tilleda, and the Bilzingsleben Paleolithic site. The Schlachtberg hill on the southeastern rim near Bad Frankenhausen was the site of the decisive Battle of Frankenhausen during the German Peasants' War in 1525, commemorated in the monumental Early Bourgeois Revolution in Germany by Werner T√ºbke. History The settlement of Tilleda, located below the northern rim of the range, was already mentioned as Dullide in the early 9th century in the Breviarium Sancti Lulli register of Hersfeld Abbey. A Kaiserpfalz at the site is attested by the 972 Marriage Charter of Empress Theophanu. Numerous stays of her husband Otto II, as well as by his successors Otto III, Conrad II, and Henry III are documented by deeds they issued here. During the 11th century, Tilleda was superseded by a castle on the hill above the settlement that may have been erected by Emperor Henry IV during the Saxon Rebellion. His son Henry V inherited the quarrels and the castle was finally slighted by the Saxon Duke (and later Emperor) Lothair of Supplinburg in 1119. Lothair himself started the reconstruction in his later years and the Imperial Castle of Kyffhausen, one of the largest castle complexes in Germany, was completed under the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Tilleda was last mentioned as an Imperial castle in 1194, when Frederick's son Henry VI reconciled here with the insurgent Welf duke Henry the Lion. In 1698 Count Albert Anton of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt had a Baroque hunting lodge erected at the hamlet of Rathsfeld in the centre of the Kyffh√§user range. Last used as a residence by Prince G√ºnther Victor of Schwarzburg after his abdication in 1918, it was turned into a recreation home of the Kyffh√§userbund veterans' association in 1925. After World War II the remote site became a Young Pioneer camp and a training camp of the East German Gesellschaft f√ºr Sport und Technik; since German reunification, the empty premises have decayed. Kyffh√§user legend Barbarossa awakens, 19th-century painting by Hermann Wislicenus in the Imperial Palace of Goslar According to a king asleep in mountain legend, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who actually drowned on 10 June 1190 in the Calycadnus River near Seleukeia in Asia Minor during the Third Crusade, is not in fact dead, but sleeps in a hidden chamber underneath the Kyffh√§user hills. He sits motionless at a stone table and his beard has supposedly grown so long over the centuries that it grew through the table. As in the similar legend of King Arthur, Barbarossa supposedly awaits his country's hour of greatest need, when he will emerge once again from under the hill. The presence of ravens circling the Kyffh√§user summit is said to be a sign of Barbarossa's continuing presence. Similar rapture legends refer to Emperor Frederick II or to Charlemagne sleeping in the Untersberg near Salzburg. The Barbarossa myth was first documented in the late 17th century and later popularized by the Brothers Grimm and a poem written in 1817 by Friedrich R√ºckert. Frequently taken up by Romantic authors, and satirized in Germany. A Winter's Tale by Heinrich Heine, it became the expression of the desire for the Old Empire's re-emergence as a German nation state. When the Kyffh√§user Monument was built at the ruins of the Imperial Castle in 1890‚Äì1896, with a statue of Frederick Barbarossa and an Emperor William monument, the German Emperor William I was thought to have \\"laid to rest\\" Barbarossa by the 1871 unification of Germany. The true background of the Kyffh√§user legend might be found in a cave on that mountain, in which important human remains were found. Some 130 persons seem to have been sacrificed to a female goddess in Bronze to Iron age times. Traces of cannibalism were found. This sacrifice to the goddess in the mountain (as well as in lakes and swamps) might be connected to the veneration of goddess Freia, Hulda or Dame Holle in the region. It could also be connected to the Venusberg of Wagner's Tannh√§user, set in the same area. The cave can be seen on the hill side, but is not accessible, due to a grate protecting it. Today Today, the hills are a popular tourist site, featuring the restored medieval Reichsburg Kyffhausen complex, including a small museum and the castle well, at depth said to be \\"the deepest castle well in the world\\". The downhill Pfalz of Tilleda is an archaeological open-air museum and a stop on the scenic Romanesque Road. The range is also the site of an annual touring car hillclimbing and of the Kyffh√§user-Berglauf cross country running competition. The range is a popular destination for hikers; the Kaiser Way leads across the Kyffh√§user northwards to the Harz mountains.

History   Origins  First developed in Italy, the stiletto dates from the late 15th century, and is thought to be a development of the rondel dagger or misericordia, a needle-pointed weapon with a narrow blade designed primarily for thrusting, though possessing cutting edges.Peterson, Harold, Daggers and Fighting Knives of the Western World, Dover Publications, , (2002), pp. 16-26Ford, Roger, et al., Weapon: A Visual History of Arms and Armor, London: DK Publishing Inc., , (2006), pp. 69, 131: In the late 1400s new blade shapes were introduced to the rondel dagger, an equilateral triangular cross-section, followed by the appearance of narrow square (cruciform) blades foreshadowing the emergence of the stiletto. Early stilettos normally used a one-piece cast-metal handle which was shaped and turned on a lathe. The stiletto blade was usually hammer-forged into a dense rod with a narrow, triangular cross-section, without any sharpened edges. However, other examples of the period have emerged bearing round, square, or diamond cross-sections. The Italian word \\"stiletto\\" comes from the Latin stilus, the thin pointed Roman writing instrument used to engrave wax or clay tablets in ancient times. The stiletto began to gain fame during the late Middle Ages, when it was the secondary weapon of knights. Originally designed as a purely offensive weapon, the stiletto was used to finish off a fallen or severely wounded heavily armored opponent. The needle-like blade could, if used with sufficient force, penetrate most mail or find its way through gaps in a knight's plate armor, and was narrow enough to pass through the eye slits of the helmeted knight. A severely wounded opponent who was not expected to survive would be given a \\"mercy strike\\" (French coup de gr√¢ce), hence the name mis√©ricorde. Later, the Gunner's Stiletto became a tool for clearing cannon- fuse touch holes; used in the manner of an automotive oil dipstick, they were often inscribed with marks indicating levels of powder charges for ranging distance.  Use as offensive weapon  The stiletto was later adopted throughout Italy as the favored offensive thrusting knife (arma manesca) of the medieval assassin,Robertson, Alexander, Father Paolo Sarpi: the Greatest of the Venetians, London: Sampson, Low, Marston & Co. (1893), pp. 114-116 so much so that it was invariably prohibited as a treacherous weapon (arma insidiosa) by the authorities of the day. The stiletto was preferred by assassins as it was silent, easily concealed inside a sleeve or jacket, and featured a blade capable of easily penetrating the heavy leather and fabric clothing of the day, while inflicting mortal wounds that tended to bleed less than those made by other types of knives. In Italy, the stiletto began to be employed along with the dagger as a fighting weapon; a 1536 dueling treatise authored by Achille Marozzo, Opera Nova, contains sections on dagger and stiletto fighting.Marozzo, Achille, Opera Nova Chiamato Duello (3rd ed.), Venetia, Italia (1568) By the time of the Renaissance, the term stiletto had come to describe a range of slender thrusting knives closely resembling the French poignard, many with conventional dagger-profile blades and sharpened edges, but always retaining the slim profile and needle-like point.Demmin, Auguste, An Illustrated History of Arms and Armour: The Dagger, Poniard, Stiletto, Kouttar, Crease, Etc., London: George Bell & Sons (1877), pp. 400-402 To lighten the weapon, many stilettos were equipped with blades carrying fullers over a portion of their length. The stiletto remained a popular weapon of criminals or political assassins from the 16th through the end of the 19th century, particularly in France, Corsica, and Italy.Baring- Gould, Sabine, The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte, London: Methuen & Co. (1897), pp. 223-224Cowen, William, Six Weeks In Corsica, London: Thomas C. Newby (1848), pp. 30-32News of the Week, The Spectator, Volume 72, No. 3,444 (30 June 1894), p. 889Bell, J. Bowyer, Assassin: Theory and Practice of Political Violence, New Brunswick NJ: Transaction Publishers, , (2005), p. 37 While still used as a weapon of surprise and assassination, the use of stiletto in preference to the dagger in close combat confrontations between adversaries became widespread throughout Italy, Sardinia, and Corsica.Letters from Italy: On the Nobility of the Genoese, The Universal Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure, London: John Hinton, Vol. 58 (July 1776), pp. 43-45 The continued popularity of the stiletto in the Kingdom of Sicily resulted in the development of the scherma di stiletto siciliano (Sicilian school of stiletto fighting).Quattrocchi, Vito, The Sicilian Blade: The Art of Sicilian Stiletto Fighting, J. Flores Publications, , (1993) A person skilled in the use of a stiletto would thrust the knife deep into the victim, then twist the blade sharply in various directions before retracting it, causing the sharp point to inflict severe internal damage not readily apparent when examining the entrance wound.Lathrop, Walter M.D., American Medicine: Modern Treatment of Wounds, Vol. 7 No. 4, January 23, 1904, p. 151: The resident surgeon at the Pennsylvania State Hospital in Hazleton noted the severe internal wounds caused by a stiletto used by a trained operator. The stiletto followed the first wave of Italian diaspora to the city of New Orleans, Louisiana during the mid-19th century, where the knife became a popular weapon of gamblers, gang members, and assorted assassins.Margavio, Anthony V. and Salomone, Jerome J., Bread and Respect: The Italians of Louisiana, Gretna, LA: Pelican Publishing Co. Inc., (2002), p. 215 The stiletto was involved in so many stabbings and murders in New Orleans that the city passed an ordinance in 1879 outlawing the sale or exhibition for sale of any stiletto within the city limits.Jewell, Edwin L., The Laws and Ordinances of the City of New Orleans: Title 16, Police Regulations, publ. Edwin L. Jewell (1882), p. 326 Italian immigrants to America frequently purchased or made such knives for self- defense,Rood, Henry E., A Pennsylvania Colliery Village, The Century Magazine, Vol. 55 No. 6 (April 1898), p. 815 and the stiletto was used by anarchists as well as by members of various Black Hand organizations to assassinate Italian- Americans and others who either opposed the Black Hand or ignored its demands for blackmail.Watkins, John, The Big Stunts of Great Detectives: The Scrapbook, Vol. 4, No. 6, New York: Frank A. Munsey (December 1907), p. 1098 The Black Hand even established schools for training its members in the use of the stiletto.  First World War  The emergence of fierce hand-to-hand combat in the trenches of World War I created a new need for stabbing weapons, resulting in the reappearance of the dagger and the stiletto. Many versions of these stabbing knives exist, some individually made by soldiers, while others were government-procured and authorized. On the Allied side, the French Lebel M1886 √©p√©e (needle sword) bayonet was frequently cut down and converted into a stiletto or thrusting knife (Poignard-Ba√Øonnette Lebel). These weapons were used to eliminate sentries in trench raids as well as for personal defense. As a class, these daggers, knives, and stilettos were given the title trench knife.Johnson, Thomas M., LTC (Ret.) & Wittmann, Thomas T.: Collecting the Edged Weapons of Imperial Germany, Vol. I, Privately published, 1988, p. 317.  Second World War  A Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife (F-S) World War II saw a resurgence of the stiletto in the form of combat knives for commando raiding forces and other troops who needed a weapon for silent killing.Dunlop, Richard, Behind Japanese Lines: With the OSS in Burma, New York: Time Life Co., , (1991): \\"Fairbairn had invented a stiletto as precise as a surgeon's scalpel. He wielded it with a flashing, slashing vigor that invariably proved fatal to an opponent. 'Why is it so long and thin?' I asked him one day in a question period during my own course of instruction. 'It doesn't have a cutting edge.' 'It doesn't leave any marks on the body,' he replied. 'Scarcely more than a tiny drop of blood.'\\" In late 1940, the famed British hand-to-hand combat instructors William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes designed the Fairbairn‚ÄìSykes fighting knife, a double-edged dagger with a long narrow point designed to optimize the blade for thrusting, though it was also capable of slashing strokes if the cutting edges were sharpened.Dunlop, Richard, Behind Japanese Lines: With the OSS in Burma, New York: Time Life Co., , (1991): Troops trained in the use of the Fairbairn-Sykes were taught not only knife fighting skills but also methods for employing the knife offensively as a single-thrust weapon in the manner of a stiletto to quietly eliminate sentinels or individual enemy soldiers. V-42 stiletto Other variations of the F-S knife soon emerged, including the U.S. Marine Raider Stiletto, which was based upon the Fairbairn-Sykes knife, and the U.S. V-42 stiletto, designed from the outset to emphasize thrusting over cutting.  The 1950s: folding knives and stiletto switchblades  During the 1950s, large numbers of folding switchblade or automatic opening knives with locking blades were imported from Italy to the United States. Most of these switchblades were side-opening designs, though some employed a telescoping blade. These Italian switchblades were commonly and popularly referred to as stilettos, since most incorporated a long, slender blade tapering to a needle-like point, together with a slim-profile handle and vestigial cross-guard. The majority of these Italian stiletto switchblade knives used a now-iconic bayonet-style blade with a single sabre-grind edge (often unsharpened) and a long opposing false edge. As with the medieval stiletto, the stiletto switchblade was designed primarily as an offensive weapon, optimized for thrusting rather than cutting. Most of these knives were designed with a locking device which locked the blade in the open position, and this lock, combined with the stiletto blade profile, enabled the knife to be used as an effective thrusting or stabbing weapon (unlike most U.S. switchblade designs of the day). Though most switchblade stilettos used a single-edge blade equipped with a long false edge, many variations exist. The stiletto switchblade is produced to this day in Italy and many other countries, and now includes many derivative folding knife designs that incorporate the same basic 'stiletto' or bayonet-style blade profile, including spring-assist, non-locking, and lock blade variants.

The Ford Aerospace AN/AVQ-10 Pave Knife was an early targeting pod developed by the USAF and US Navy to designate and guide laser-guided bombs. Pave Knife was developed in 1969 to replace the original, essentially improvised Airborne Laser Designator (ALD) and TRIM pod (see A-6 Intruder). ALD was not a pod but a hand-held laser operated by the weapon systems officer to mark targets for Paveway laser- guided bombs. Pave Knife was a roughly banana-shaped external pod, weighing about 550 kg (1,200 lb), containing a steerable laser and closed-circuit television camera. The weapon systems officer or bombardier/navigator (BN) monitored the TV image with a small Sony TV in the cockpit and steered the laser onto the target with a hand controller, then passing the target information to the aircraft's gun sight. The Pave Knife bid was a firm fixed- price contract, involving design, development, and manufacture of one prototype, which was considered to be of vital nature due to the war in Vietnam. Ford Aerospace was known at that time as Philco-Ford, Aeronutronics Division, in Newport Beach, California. This facility was recognized for its strong engineering skills in electro-optics and image stabilization. During this time, Philco-Ford was producing the optical heat seeking section of the AIM-9 missile. A project manager convinced the company to invest (while the bids were being reviewed by the USAF) in creating the specifications for the subcontracts, selecting the subcontractors, preparing contract verbiage, and setting it up to be able to turn on all the engineering and procurement on the day after the winner of the bidding was announced. The remainder of the design, prototype fabrication and system integration was completed within budget, and on-time with delivery accomplished in an astonishing 6 months from the contract award date. The key subcontractors were Dalmo Victor in the San Francisco Bay peninsula who provided the night vision system. Another contractor provided a very complex power supply with multiple outputs to operate numerous system components, which had to be squeezed into a semi-oval shape to fit against the inner shape of the pod, with protrusions on the power supply to fit into whatever space was left after other components were designed in. Yet another provided the laser designator. All the subcontractors met their specifications, price, and delivery dates. When the pod was shipped to Florida for testing at Eglin Air Force Base, the system met specifications. It immediately entered testing and performed so well that within a few weeks, it was shipped to Vietnam and placed into service where it met objectives. McDonnell Douglas F-4D-31-MC, 66-7693, acted as the test-bed at the Armament Development Test Center, and the pod was carried on left inner wing pylon (Station 2), bolted on in an asymmetric configuration which typically included a 370 US gallon drop tank on the starboard wing, plus up to two LGBs (on Stations 1 and 8), along with the regular fit of a centerline tank, Sparrows and ECM.Thornbororough, Anthony M., and Davies, Peter E., \\"The Phantom Story\\", Arms and Armour Press, A Cassell Imprint, London, UK, 1994, , page 126. The system used various technologies including image stabilization, night vision, target designation with a laser, and optical tracking to stay with moving ground targets. It had to withstand high G forces as well as very low and very high temperatures. A second jet with a laser-guided bomb using a guidance system provided by Texas Instruments would operate as a team with the first jet and drop the munitions. Pave Knife was used by F-4 Phantom II and A-6 Intruder aircraft in the attack role. It was used operationally in the Vietnam War; while it had its limitations, it validated the combat utility of laser- guided bombs. The Pave Knife was superseded by the later Pave Spike and Pave Tack systems, and is no longer in service. A dozen USAF F-4Ds of the 433d Tactical Fighter Squadron, all from Block 31, were wired for Pave Knife, a dozen of which pods were built and six deployed to Southeast Asia. Three were held in reserve and three were diverted to the U.S. Navy for use on A-6As of VA-145.Thornbororough, Anthony M., and Davies, Peter E., \\"The Phantom Story\\", Arms and Armour Press, A Cassell Imprint, London, UK, 1994, , page 126.

Since the latter are strings of numbers, one can view this as a kind of numeral system for representing N, although the main utility is representing a k-combination by N rather than the other way around. Distinct numbers correspond to distinct k-combinations, and produce them in lexicographic order; moreover the numbers less than \\\\tbinom nk correspond to all k-combinations of }. The correspondence does not depend on the size n of the set that the k-combinations are taken from, so it can be interpreted as a map from N to the k-combinations taken from N; in this view the correspondence is a bijection. The number N corresponding to (ck,...,c2,c1) is given by :N=\\\\binom{c_k}k+\\\\cdots+\\\\binom{c_2}2+\\\\binom{c_1}1. The fact that a unique sequence so corresponds to any number N was observed by D. H. Lehmer.Applied Combinatorial Mathematics, Ed. E. F. Beckenbach (1964), pp.27‚àí30. Indeed a greedy algorithm finds the k-combination corresponding to N: take ck maximal with \\\\tbinom{c_k}k\\\\leq N, then take ck ‚àí 1 maximal with \\\\tbinom{c_{k-1}}{k-1}\\\\leq N - \\\\tbinom{c_k}k, and so forth. Finding the number N, using the formula above, from the k-combination (ck,...,c2,c1) is also known as \\"ranking\\", and the opposite operation (given by the greedy algorithm) as \\"unranking\\"; these operations are known by those names in most computer algebra systems, and in computational mathematics.http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~lucia/courses/5165-09/GenCombObj.pdfhttps://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/combinat/subset.html The originally used term \\"combinatorial representation of integers\\" is shortened to \\"combinatorial number system\\" by Knuth,. who also gives a much older reference; the term \\"combinadic\\" is introduced by James McCaffrey (without reference to previous terminology or work). Unlike the factorial number system, the combinatorial number system of degree k is not a mixed radix system: the part \\\\tbinom{c_i}i of the number N represented by a \\"digit\\" ci is not obtained from it by simply multiplying by a place value. The main application of the combinatorial number system is that it allows rapid computation of the k-combination that is at a given position in the lexicographic ordering, without having to explicitly list the k-combinations preceding it; this allows for instance random generation of k-combinations of a given set. Enumeration of k-combinations has many applications, among which software testing, sampling, quality control, and the analysis of lottery games.  Ordering combinations  A k-combination of a set S is a subset of S with k (distinct) elements. The main purpose of the combinatorial number system is to provide a representation, each by a single number, of all \\\\tbinom nk possible k-combinations of a set S of n elements. Choosing, for any n, } as such a set, it can be arranged that the representation of a given k-combination C is independent of the value of n (although n must of course be sufficiently large); in other words considering C as a subset of a larger set by increasing n will not change the number that represents C. Thus for the combinatorial number system one just considers C as a k-combination of the set N of all natural numbers, without explicitly mentioning n. In order to ensure that the numbers representing the k-combinations of } are less than those representing k-combinations not contained in }, the k-combinations must be ordered in such a way that their largest elements are compared first. The most natural ordering that has this property is lexicographic ordering of the decreasing sequence of their elements. So comparing the 5-combinations C = {0,3,4,6,9} and C' = {0,1,3,7,9}, one has that C comes before C', since they have the same largest part 9, but the next largest part 6 of C is less than the next largest part 7 of C'; the sequences compared lexicographically are (9,6,4,3,0) and (9,7,3,1,0). Another way to describe this ordering is view combinations as describing the k raised bits in the binary representation of a number, so that C = {c1,...,ck} describes the number :2^{c_1}+2^{c_2}+\\\\cdots+2^{c_k} (this associates distinct numbers to all finite sets of natural numbers); then comparison of k-combinations can be done by comparing the associated binary numbers. In the example C and C' correspond to numbers 10010110012 = 60110 and 10100010112 = 65110, which again shows that C comes before C'. This number is not however the one one wants to represent the k-combination with, since many binary numbers have a number of raised bits different from k; one wants to find the relative position of C in the ordered list of (only) k-combinations.  Place of a combination in the ordering  The number associated in the combinatorial number system of degree k to a k-combination C is the number of k-combinations strictly less than C in the given ordering. This number can be computed from C = { ck, ..., c2, c1 } with ck > ... > c2 > c1 as follows. From the definition of the ordering it follows that for each k-combination S strictly less than C, there is a unique index i such that ci is absent from S, while ck, ..., ci+1 are present in S, and no other value larger than ci is. One can therefore group those k-combinations S according to the possible values 1, 2, ..., k of i, and count each group separately. For a given value of i one must include ck, ..., ci+1 in S, and the remaining i elements of S must be chosen from the ci non-negative integers strictly less than ci; moreover any such choice will result in a k-combinations S strictly less than C. The number of possible choices is \\\\tbinom{c_i}i, which is therefore the number of combinations in group i; the total number of k-combinations strictly less than C then is :\\\\binom{c_1}1+\\\\binom{c_2}2+\\\\cdots+\\\\binom{c_k}k, and this is the index (starting from 0) of C in the ordered list of k-combinations. Obviously there is for every N ‚àà N exactly one k-combination at index N in the list (supposing k ‚â• 1, since the list is then infinite), so the above argument proves that every N can be written in exactly one way as a sum of k binomial coefficients of the given form.  Finding the k-combination for a given number  The given formula allows finding the place in the lexicographic ordering of a given k-combination immediately. The reverse process of finding the k-combination at a given place N requires somewhat more work, but is straightforward nonetheless. By the definition of the lexicographic ordering, two k-combinations that differ in their largest element ck will be ordered according to the comparison of those largest elements, from which it follows that all combinations with a fixed value of their largest element are contiguous in the list. Moreover the smallest combination with ck as largest element is \\\\tbinom{c_k}k, and it has ci = i ‚àí 1 for all i < k (for this combination all terms in the expression except \\\\tbinom{c_k}k are zero). Therefore ck is the largest number such that \\\\tbinom{c_k}k\\\\leq N. If k > 1 the remaining elements of the k-combination form the -combination corresponding to the number N-\\\\tbinom{c_k}k in the combinatorial number system of degree , and can therefore be found by continuing in the same way for N-\\\\tbinom{c_k}k and instead of N and k.  Example  Suppose one wants to determine the 5-combination at position 72. The successive values of \\\\tbinom n5 for n = 4, 5, 6, ... are 0, 1, 6, 21, 56, 126, 252, ..., of which the largest one not exceeding 72 is 56, for n = 8\\\\. Therefore c5 = 8, and the remaining elements form the 4-combination at position . The successive values of \\\\tbinom n4 for n = 3, 4, 5, ... are 0, 1, 5, 15, 35, ..., of which the largest one not exceeding 16 is 15, for n = 6, so c4 = 6\\\\. Continuing similarly to search for a 3-combination at position one finds c3 = 3, which uses up the final unit; this establishes 72=\\\\tbinom85+\\\\tbinom64+\\\\tbinom33, and the remaining values ci will be the maximal ones with \\\\tbinom{c_i}i=0, namely . Thus we have found the 5-combination }.  National Lottery example in Excel  For each of the \\\\binom{49}6 lottery combinations c1 < c2 < c3 < c4 < c5 < c6 , there is a list number N between 0 and \\\\binom{49}6 - 1 which can be found by adding : \\\\binom{49-c_1} 6 + \\\\binom{49-c_2} 5 + \\\\binom{49-c_3} 4 + \\\\binom{49-c_4} 3 + \\\\binom{49-c_5} 2 + \\\\binom{49-c_6} 1. Suppose you want to find a position of a British National Lottery result 3,6,15,17,18,35 in a list of possible results. Excel function COMBIN(49,6) would show that number of results is 13983816. Now if you put numbers 3,6,15,17,18,35 each in its cell and formulas COMBIN(49-3,6), COMBIN(49-6,5), COMBIN(49-15,4), COMBIN(49-17,3), COMBIN(49-18,2), 49‚àí35 under each of them. Use cell references instead of actual values, the actual values are provided for readability. You would get a row of numbers of 9366819,962598,46376,4960,465,14. Adding these would show particular position 10381232. Note that you do not need use formula COMBIN(49-35,1) to get 14. You can have it by subtraction 49-35 alone. Also the COMBIN function does not return 0 in case 49-X becomes less than 6. You'd need to use IF with ISNUMBER function to convert #NUM! into 0. Now the reverse engineering is a bit trickier. You could use 49 IF statements in one cell or use solver to find maximum argument for COMBIN result to be less or equal than position number. Instead let's use a table of 6 by 49 and use MATCH function where resulting row number would be the argument and a ball number. If you make column headings from 6 to 1 (B1:G1) in descending order and row labels of 1 to 49 (A2:A50) in ascending order (vertically ascending in Excel means numbers growing from top to bottom). Then if you fill up the table with formula COMBIN($A2,B$1) starting from left top corner. $ signs will make sure that index values are always taken from heading row and label column. Replace #NUM! with zeros. You should get something like this: 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 0 0 0 1 3 3 4 0 0 1 4 6 4 5 0 1 5 10 10 5 6 1 6 15 20 15 6 7 7 21 35 35 21 7 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 9 84 126 126 84 36 9 10 210 252 210 120 45 10 11 462 462 330 165 55 11 12 924 792 495 220 66 12 ... 49 13983816 1906884 211876 18424 1176 49 Now if you create a new row of six cells and fill them with formulas which would find the largest values in each column which are less than or equal to position number in question: The first cell with =INDEX(B2:B50,MATCH(10381232,B2:B50)), the rest of the cells with INDEX(C2:C50,MATCH(10381232-SUM(of previous cells),C2:C50)) ... INDEX(G2:G50,MATCH(10381232-SUM(of previous cells),G2:G50)) This would present you with a row of values you have already seen 9366819,962598,46376,4960,465,14 Now in a next row first cell write =49-MATCH(10381232,B2:B50) and similarly =49-MATCH(10381232-9366819,C2:C50) ... =49-MATCH(10381232-9366819-962598-46376-4960-465,G2:G50) Again use the references to cells instead of actual values. You should be presented with original ball numbers of 3,6,15,17,18,35. Now you can generate a fresh Lottery number combination from single =randbetween(1,combin(49,6)) or you could look at the list position numbers of earlier results to see if there is a trend.  Applications  One could use the combinatorial number system to list or traverse all k-combinations of a given finite set, but this is a very inefficient way to do that. Indeed, given some k-combination it is much easier to find the next combination in lexicographic ordering directly than to convert a number to a k-combination by the method indicated above. To find the next combination, find the smallest i ‚â• 2 for which ci ‚â• ci‚àí1+2 (if there is no such i, take i = k+1); then increase ci‚àí1 by one and set all cj with to their minimal value . If the k-combination is represented by its characteristic vector, that is as a binary value with k bits 1, then the next such value can be computed without any loop using bitwise arithmetic: the following C++ function will advance to that value or return : // find next k-combination bool next_combination(unsigned long& x) // assume x has form x'01^a10^b in binary { unsigned long u = x & -x; // extract rightmost bit 1; u = 0'00^a10^b unsigned long v = u + x; // set last non-trailing bit 0, and clear to the right; v=x'10^a00^b if (v0) // then overflow in v, or x0 return false; // signal that next k-combination cannot be represented x = v +(((v^x)/u)>>2); // v^x = 0'11^a10^b, (v^x)/u = 0'0^b1^{a+2}, and x ‚Üê x'100^b1^a return true; // successful completion } This is called Gosper's hack; corresponding assembly code was described as item 175 in HAKMEM. On the other hand the possibility to directly generate the k-combination at index N has useful applications. Notably, it allows generating a random k-combination of an n-element set using a random integer N with 0\\\\leq N<\\\\tbinom nk, simply by converting that number to the corresponding k-combination. If a computer program needs to maintain a table with information about every k-combination of a given finite set, the computation of the index N associated with a combination will allow the table to be accessed without searching.

Early life and career Former residence of Xue Yue in Nanjing. Born to a Hakka peasant family in Shaoguan, Guangdong, Xue joined the Tongmenghui in 1909. In the Spring of 1912, he was admitted to the Guangdong Military Primary School. In 1917, he was admitted to the sixth class of the Baoding Military Academy. However, in July 1918, he departed south for Guangzhou and joined an army created by Sun Zhongshan and Chen Jiongming with the rank of captain. Afterwards, he became commander of the first battalion of Sun's bodyguard. When Sun and Chen fell out, Xue escorted Soong Ching-Ling to safety. Xue was one of the most effective nationalist commanders of the Northern Expedition, serving as the commander of the 1st Division of the 1st Army. After the April 12 Incident, he recommended that Chiang Kai-shek be arrested as a counterrevolutionary. Purged from the 1st Army, Xue returned to Guangdong to serve as a divisional commander under Li Jishen. After political turmoil that saw Chiang return to power, Xue joined Zhang Fakui and served in the Guangdong 4th Army. During the Guangzhou Uprising, Xue's troops were called into the city to help suppress the Communists. Due to losses suffered over the course of the latter part of 1927, the 4th Army accepted Chiang's offer to reorganize. However, internal divisions saw newly appointed commander Miao Peinan forced out and Zhang Fakui's return as commander of the Guangdong 4th Army. Xue was promoted to become Zhang's deputy. During the Central Plains War, the Guangdong 4th Army supported the New Guangxi Clique in opposing Chiang. During the combined forces' entry into Hengyang, their line of retreat was cut off by Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai. In the ensuing Battle of Hengyang, the combined Guangdong-Guangxi army suffered a serious defeat. The Guangdong 4th Army was forced to join Chiang, Zhang Fakui was forced to resign, and Xue was promoted to command of the army. During the first stage of the Chinese Civil War, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek ordered General Xue to lead the Guangdong First Army to attack the Chinese communists during the Fifth Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet, forcing them to start the Long March and his forces chased the retreating communists all the way to Sichuan and Guizhou, until the communist forces retreated across the great swamplands and finally escaped to Shaanxi Province. He then turned his forces around and marched unstopped to Central China and defeated the famed Red Army commanders like He Long and Ye Ting of the communist area which they controlled and forced them out of these strongholds. For these accomplishments, Chiang Kai-shek hailed him as \\"a true example of a Chinese officer\\". Second Sino-Japanese War After the Xi'an Incident, however, Xue's loyalty was in doubt after he offered to personally arrest Chiang Kai- shek and hand him over to the Communists if Chiang refused to fight the Japanese immediately. Although he immediately reconciled with Chiang Kai-shek, his relations with the KMT were strained throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War. Xue commanded the 19th Army Group that fought the Battle of Shanghai. Later, during the Campaign of Battle of Northern and Eastern Henan (January‚ÄìJune 1938) he commanded the Eastern Henan Army. Xue was also involved in the Battle of Wuhan,Wuhan, 1938, Stephen R. MacKinnon, Robert Capa, p 27, accessed July 2009 commanding the 1st Army Corps. In the mountains northwest of Wuhan, Xue succeeded in nearly destroying the entire 106th division of the imperial Japanese army. During the battle, most of the Japanese officers were killed and the Japanese had to air-drop 300 officers by parachutes into the battlefield. This was the only occasion the Imperial Japanese Army had to use airborne strategy to save a whole division from being eliminated by enemy forces during the Second World War. Xue Yue was also responsible for the victories of the 9th Front, in the First, Second and Third Battle for Changsha. His forces of the 9th Front were also victorious at the Battle of Changde but were defeated in the Fourth Battle of Changsha. The KMT and General Stilwell would not support him or supply his soldiers with ammunition to fight the Japanese due to Stillwell's belief that there was rampant corruption in the KMT Army that resulted in generals or KMT officials diverting resources away from the battlefield. To Stillwell's dismay, however, Chennault's air forces supplied Xue with ammunition throughout the war, whenever this was possible. Xue's 9th Front was also responsible for protecting Chennault's airfields. Chennault and Xue became sworn brothers and remained close friends until Chennault's death in 1958. Chennault also recounts in his memoirs, \\"Way of a Fighter,\\" that in July 1945, just as Chennault had resigned, he made a trip over enemy lines to see Xue Yue. (In his memoirs, Chennault refers to Xue Yue as Hsueh Yo). Xue had marched for two days to get to the meeting, but Chennault was only able to disappoint him in his quest for arms and ammunition to launch a counteroffensive: Chennault's superiors had taken everything for an effort being organized in Chongqing. And so: Chinese civil war and after After World War II, Xue refused to exchange his gold for the Gold Yuan paper currency as mandated by law. When Huang Shaoxiong informed Xue that this was illegal, Xue responded that he and his subordinates' gold was paid for in blood and he was personally responsible for it. When Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan in 1949, Xue was put in charge of defending Hainan Island. The victorious Red Army defeated the demoralized Nationalist Forces. Xue left for Taiwan after the defense of Hainan collapsed. In Taiwan, he served as adviser to the chief of staff, in name only. He was Master of Ceremony, an honorary title, at Chiang Kai-shek's funeral in 1975. He lived until 1998 to the age of 101.

It is a sub-prefecture of the department. Geography Cognac is situated on the river Charente between the towns of Angoul√™me and Saintes. The majority of the town has been built on the river's left bank, with the smaller right bank area known as the Saint Jacques district. The town is situated on one of the pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela and is home to the French Air Force training base 709. Cognac is southwest of Paris. Climate History Unknown prior to the 9th century, the town was subsequently fortified. During the Hundred Years' War, the town changed sides on several occasions as the result of fighting and treaties in the region. The town gave its name to the 1526 League of Cognac, an anti-Habsburg alliance formed by Francis I, who granted it the lucrative right to trade salt along the river, which led to its later development as a center of wine and brandy. In November 1651, it was besieged by rebels led by Prince de Cond√© during the 1648-1653 civil war or \\"Fronde\\"; it was relieved in December by a force under Comte d' Harcourt and given additional trading privileges by Louis XIV as a reward for its resistance. Population The inhabitants of the town are known as Cogna√ßais. Landmarks * The Old Town. The town's medieval quarter \\"Vieux Cognac\\" runs from the Tours Saint-Jacques, alongside the river, up to the Saint-L√©ger church. The area contains many unusual buildings, built between the 15th and 18th centuries, situated on narrow cobbled streets. Many contain sculptures of the salamander, the symbol of King Fran√ßois I, as well as gargoyles and richly decorated fa√ßades. * The Ch√¢teau des Valois, an important medieval trading post. * The Saint-L√©ger church. Church Exterior * The mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire (art and history museum) * The mus√©e des arts du Cognac (art museum) * The Saint-Gobain glassworks and barrelworks * Cognac Public Garden The area also contains many Romanesque churches as well as several ch√¢teaux. Cognac brandy The town gives its name to one of the world's best-known types of brandy or eau de vie. Drinks must be made in certain areas around the town of Cognac and must be made according to strictly defined regulations to be granted the name Cognac. Cognac is a unique spirit in that it is double-distilled. This process can be viewed in one of the many \\"Grande Marque\\" Cognac houses which all have visitor centers. Most central in the town are Hennessy, Martell, Otard, Camus and Remy Martin. About east of Cognac is Jarnac, home to Courvoisier. There are six vineyard areas around the Cognac area, all of which are within the Appellation Controlee for Cognac, but which are considered to vary in quality from the best growth area of \\"Grande Champagne\\" (nothing to do with the Champagne wine region in NE France), through \\"Petite Champagne\\" then \\"Borderies\\", \\"Fins Bois\\", \\"Bon Bois\\" and finally \\"Bois Ordinaire\\". The best Cognacs are generally only made using Grande and Petite Champagne grapes, but all Cognac is produced by blending a variety of \\"Eau de Vie\\" which can be made from grapes from different locations, and from different vintages. It is the cellar master's skill that ensures that a brand's Cognac is recognizable regardless of when it is produced since he can blend multiple eaux de vie to achieve the right taste for his house. Different qualities of Cognac are produced by all brands, and include VS (\\"Very Special\\"); VSOP (\\"Very Superior [or, more commonly, \\"Special\\", though the Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac specifies \\"Superior\\"] Old Pale\\") and XO (\\"eXtra Old\\"). (English terms are still used, since in the early days of Cognac production it was the British and Irish who were the main consumers and also became some of the main producers of Cognac, using techniques acquired from the distillation of whiskey, etc.) These are controlled by the length of time the Cognac is allowed to mature in oak barrels, a minimum time being required at each grade level. The longer the Cognac matures in the barrel the smoother it will generally become. Once it is bottled no further development takes place. Most houses still have barrels of Cognac dating back to the 19th century sitting in their cellars waiting for fine blending by the Cellar Master.

Administratively, it is within the Birkenhead and Tranmere Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in Merseyside. Before local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974, it was part of the County Borough of Birkenhead, within the geographical county of Cheshire. At the 2001 census, the population of Tranmere was 11,668. By the 2011 census the suburb was combined with the centre of Birkenhead. The population was recorded as 15,879. History Its name was given by Norwegian Vikings who settled and colonised Wirral in the 10th century. Tranmere in Old Norse is Trani-melr, meaning \\"crane (bird) sandbank\\" or \\"sandbank with the cranes\\". Until the early 19th century, Tranmere was the second most populous settlement in Wirral, with a population of 353 in 1801, centred mainly in the area of what is now Church Road and the nearby hamlet of Hinderton. By 1901, the number of residents had grown to 37,709. Tranmere Old Hall and its estate, was situated around what is now Church Road. It was a large, gabled building constructed around 1614. According to the author Philip Sulley's The Hundred of Wirral (1889), in about 1860: > ... [Tranmere Old Hall] was pulled down by an ignorant boor who became > possessed of it by some mischance, to make way for shops and houses. Historically a township in the parish of Bebington in the Wirral Hundred, it became a civil parish from 1866. In 1877 Tranmere was absorbed into the County Borough of Birkenhead, Cheshire, and the civil parish was abolished in 1898. On creation of the county of Merseyside in 1974, Tranmere became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. The Ingleborough Road Memorial Playing Fields were part of the now defunct Birkenhead Instutute school from 1925 and opened for use the following year. The fields and pavilion were created as a memorial to the former students of the school killed in action in World War I, which included the poet Wilfred Owen. Ornamental gates were added to the site in 1933. The site was purchased by Tranmere Rovers Football Club in 1995. Despite opposition, the land was redeveloped for housing in 2012. Ferry service Queen Elizabeth granted John Poole the lease of ferry rights at Tranmere in 1586. The Etna, the first steam-powered ferry on the River Mersey operated from Tranmere Pool to Liverpool on 17 April 1817. The early part of the 19th Century were prosperous times for Tranmere's ferry service, but this was to change with the completion of Thomas Brassey's New Chester Road in 1833 and the opening of the Chester and Birkenhead Railway in 1840. Further blows to trade came with the commencement of a horse-drawn tramway in 1877 between New Ferry and Woodside Ferry and the opening of the Mersey Railway between Liverpool and nearby Green Lane railway station in 1886. By 1904, the ferry service had ceased and Tranmere Pool was enclosed as Cammell Laird Dock as part of an extension of the shipyard. Air raid shelter Tranmere contains one of the largest and most expensive World War II air raid shelters in the country. The shelter consists of a series of tunnels stretching to a total length of , and was designed to house up to 6,000 people; many of them workers at the strategically important Cammell Laird shipyard. However, by the time the tunnels were completed, they were no longer needed as the threat of invasion had diminished. The tunnels were later used by the Ministry of Food for storage, and were considered as a nuclear fallout shelter during the Cold War era. The tunnels were finally sealed off in 1989, amid growing health and safety concerns. The tunnels still exist and building work in 2008 uncovered a shaft, which allowed temporary exploration, before being sealed off again. Geography Tranmere is situated on the eastern side of the Wirral Peninsula, at the western side of the River Mersey. The area is approximately south-south-east of the Irish Sea at New Brighton and about east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Thurstaston. Tranmere is at an elevation of between above sea level, with the highest point to the south of St Catherine's Hospital. Governance Tranmere is within the parliamentary constituency of Birkenhead. The current Member of Parliament is Mick Whitley, a Labour representative. At local government level, the area is mostly incorporated into the Birkenhead and Tranmere Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. (A small portion to the south of Green Lane station is now part of the Rock Ferry Ward.) Representation on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council is undertaken by three councillors. The most recent local elections took place on 2 May 2019. Community Tranmere is made up of industrial buildings and Victorian terraced houses, although it has seen a significant amount of property development recently. From 2005, the area was one of the 35 government neighbourhood pathfinder areas. Education Mersey Park Primary School serves the area. Healthcare St Catherine's Health Centre occupies a large site in Higher Tranmere. The original facility on the site was built as the Birkenhead Union Workhouse between 1861 and 1863 and designed by Thomas Leyland. Around 2013, the Victorian hospital buildings were replaced with a modern medical facility and community centre. Green spaces Two urban parks are located in Tranmere. Mersey Park to the north and Victoria Park to the south. Mersey Park hosts one of several annual Bonfire Night municipal firework displays put on by Wirral Borough Council. Victoria Park contains a community hall at the bottom of Albany Road, a cricket pitch and clubhouse. Victoria Park was originally the gardens of a large property called The Towers, built in the 1860s as a French- style chateau by Victor Poutz, a French cotton merchant. Landmarks Tranmere Cross, Victoria Park At the top end of Victoria Park stands the Tranmere Cross, a cross fragment with a worn stone base, believed to be circa fifteenth century in origin. The structure is a designated Grade II listed building that was put on the present site in 1937 and which once marked the entrance to Tranmere on Church Road. Sport Tranmere is best known for its football club, Tranmere Rovers F.C., founded in 1884. Tranmere Rovers now plays at nearby Prenton Park, in Birkenhead itself, but has kept the Tranmere name. Transport Green Lane railway station is situated on the Wirral line of the Merseyrail network. Services operate northbound to Liverpool, via Birkenhead town centre and southbound to Chester and Ellesmere Port. Notable people Mersey Park Primary School has several famous former pupils including Jason McAteer (footballer) and Patricia Routledge (Hyacinth Bucket in the BBC TV sitcom Keeping up Appearances). Paul O'Grady, famous for his alter-ego creation Lily Savage, was raised in the area. Colin Haygarth, the Scottish gunmaker, was born in Tranmere. He lived in Milton Road until he was four years old, when his family moved to nearby Irby. He was The Queen Mother's gunmaker from 1965 until 2002, is the oldest living gunmaker in the UK and the last to have done \\"war work\\". He made parts for Sten guns in the workshops of the gunmaker W.C. Carswell in Liverpool, and served in the Irby branch of the Home Guard.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1999, and a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1999. The son of Marshall F. Findlay and Verna B. Cochrane, he was born in Shoal Lake, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba and the University of Illinois. He worked as a farmer on his family's 5,000 acre beef farm after returning to the province, and was a professor in the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Manitoba from 1970 to 1977. He married Katherine E. Kennedy. Findlay was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1986, easily winning the rural riding of Virden as a Progressive Conservative. The election was narrowly won by the New Democratic Party under Howard Pawley, and Findlay joined 25 other Conservatives in the official opposition. The Pawley government fell in 1988, when disgruntled backbencher Jim Walding voted against his own government. Findlay was re-elected without difficulty in the general election which followed, and was appointed Minister of Agriculture with responsibility for the Manitoba Telephone System on May 9, 1988. The Virden riding was eliminated by redistribution in the 1990 election and Findlay ran in the riding of Springfield, where he defeated NDP candidate Deborah Barron-McNabb by almost 2,000 votes. He endorsed Jean Charest's bid to lead the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in June 1993. On September 10, 1993, he was named Minister of Highways and Transportation, retaining responsibility for the provincial telephone system. He was re-elected in the provincial election of 1995, again defeating his NDP opponent by about 2000 votes. In 1996, Findlay was responsible for coordinating the government's highly controversial decision to sell the MTS. Findlay left cabinet on February 5, 1999, and did not seek re-election later in the year. In 2000, he was appointed to a federal panel reviewing the Canada Transportation Act. In 2006, he was appointed by the federal government to the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board.

It is a subsidiary of the Go-Ahead Group and operates most buses under contract to Transport for London. The company is named after the London General Omnibus Company, the principal operator of buses in London between 1855 and 1933. History The original logo The modern-day London GeneralCompanies House extract company no 2328489 London General Transport Services Limited commenced operating on 1 April 1989 when London Buses was divided into 11 separate business units. Its original logo being an omnibus in reflection of the name's history. In 1994 the company was sold in a management buyout, before being sold to the Go-Ahead Group in May 1996.Go-Ahead annual report 29 June 1996 Go- Ahead Group plc The company moved its offices to an address in Merton, adjacent to the Merton bus garage. In August 2008, Go-Ahead's London bus operations all adopted the Go-Ahead London trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo. In October 2009, Go-Ahead completed the purchase of East Thames Buses from Transport for London and incorporated it into London General. Although Transport for London's normal practice is to put routes out for tender, London General began a new five-year contract for all East Thames Buses routes without going through the tendering process. In March 2012, First London's Northumberland Park garage was purchased. On 1 April 2014, the London operations of Metrobus depots in Croydon and Orpington were integrated into London General. On 25 April 2014, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency formally increased London General's licence to accommodate the Metrobus buses.Go-Ahead London welcomes Metrobus garages into fold Bus Talk issue 27 April 2014\\"Metrobus within Go-Ahead London\\" The London Bus (London Omnibus Traction Society) issue 598 June 2014 page 7\\"Go-Ahead London\\" Buses Magazine issue 713 August 2014 page 71 However, as at September 2014, the buses continued to carry Metrobus branding. Garages London General operates 9 bus garages. Sutton (A) As at February 2020, Sutton garage operate routes 80, 93, 151, 154, 164 (partial Sunday allocation only), 213. Go-Ahead London History Opened by the London General Omnibus Company in January 1924 at cost of ¬£30,000, Sutton garage had a capacity for 100 buses. During its early years, less than half of the garage was put to use, holding only 40 buses by 1926. This would change somewhat by the extension of the Underground to Morden and major house- building projects in the area. Between 1945 and 1953, it had an allocation of exactly 100 relaxed-Utility Daimlers (classed as Ds) numbered from D182 - D281. By 1952, the garage had 128 buses allocated, achieved mainly by parking buses in surrounding streets. However, this would soon fall again, to 100 in 1966, 82 in 1976 and 62 in 1987. The garage passed to the reborn London General bus company in the run-up to privatisation in 1985. Sutton Garage also partly took control of route 200 at a yard in Colliers Wood (AA) in 1989, after Cityrama withdrew from their contract. Sutton was responsible for providing drivers for the service, whilst Merton garage were contracted to do the maintenance. By 1994, the garage allocation had grown to 85 buses and again to 92 in 2001, including 10 buses subcontracted to Surrey County Council. Sutton also helped when Carshalton garage closed in 1964. Putney (AF) Putney bus garage As of March 2020, Putney garage operate routes 14, 22, 74, 337, 424, 430, 639, 670, N22 and N74. History With its ancestry going back to the horse bus days of the 1880s, Chelverton Road Garage was converted to a motor-bus garage in 1912. The garage is well hidden in a side road with a modest frontage, yet it has an allocation of 112. It has been modernised twice, firstly in 1935 and then again in 1985. The garage was well- known for being allocated the pre-war RTs in 1940, which displaced the STLs. During the war the garage was under-utilised and was used to store de-licensed buses. Renamed Putney, in 1963, after the closure of Putney Bridge Garage (F), it started to receive both short and long wheelbase AEC Routemasters for its Central London routes. The Routemasters remained at the garage until July 2005, when both the 14 and 22 were converted to low floor one-person-operated buses. Merton (AL) As at February 2020, Merton garage operate routes 44, 57, 131, 152, 163, 164, 200, 219, 280 and 655. It also runs the St. Bede's School private bus services 514 and 519, which run between the Caterham area and the school, on behalf of Surrey County Council. History The garage was modernised in 1960, and again in 1991 when a new roof was fitted and various stores and welfare areas were moved to provide a larger, unobstructed parking area, which had previously been long and narrow. Merton was also responsible for the maintenance of vehicles for route 200 in 1988/9 after the withdrawal of the Cityrama sightseeing company, whilst the route was operated from Sutton garage. The garage has become Go-Ahead London's head office, following the sale of Raleigh House, Mitcham and the acquisition of the former pub (King's Head, Merton) next door. Croydon (C) As of September 2020, Croydon garage operate routes 119, 127, 197, 355, 359, 403, 434, 455 and X26 History The Beddington Lane depot was opened by Metrobus in December 2005 to house route 127 which had been surrendered early by Centra. Work was completed on the garage buildings in February 2006. This garage took over the London routes that ran from Godstone with the exception of the 146 and 246 which moved to Orpington. Orpington (MB) As of August 2019, the Green Street Green garage operate routes 126, 138, 162, 208, 227, 233, 246, 320, 352, 353, 358, 654, R1, R2, R3, R4, R6, R8, R9 and R11. History A former farm, Green Street Green depot was for many years the only garage for all of Metrobus' London tendered routes since the award of route 61 in 1986. More recently routes have been operated from Godstone and in December 2005 a new depot was constructed in Croydon to cope with new tender awards. During mid-2005 major reconstruction started on the Green Street Green site to make improvements and provide an expansion. During these works, a temporary base was being used at Sevenoaks in next to the base of what was Southlands Travel. Northumberland Park (NP) As at June 2020, Northumberland Park garage operate routes 4, 67, 76, 106, 153, 184, 212, 214, 230, 232, 357, 379, 444, 476, 657 and W10. History Capital Citybus was bought out by the management team in late 1995, and subsequently by FirstGroup in 1998 becoming First Capital. In March 2012, FirstGroup sold Northumberland Park garage, together with its route contracts, vehicles and staff to the Go-Ahead Group with it becoming part of London General.Go-Ahead Group Acquires Northumberland Park Bus Depot Go-Ahead Group 19 March 2012On 13 October 2017, route 257 was transferred to Stagecoach London (East London) On 2 June 2018, route 491 was transferred to Metroline. On 9 June 2018, route 231 was transferred to Metroline and route 327 was transferred to Sullivan Buses. On 15 June 2020, London General commenced operating route 4 Waterside Way (PL) As at February 2020, Waterside Way, Wimbledon garage operated routes 39, 485, and 493. This depot also acts as a storage for the training bus fleet. Waterloo (RA) Waterloo garage operates Red Arrow routes 507 and 521. History The garage opened in the early 1980s as a Red Arrow garage and in the 1990s had an allocation of AEC Routemasters for route 11. The garage only operates Monday to Friday due to its proximity to residential properties. In June 2002. the Red Arrow Leyland Nationals were replaced by London's first fleet of Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses. Because of the extra space required to stable these, the route 11 Routemasters were transferred to Stockwell garage. In September 2009 the articulated fleet was replaced by Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaros. Stockwell (SW) As of December 2019, Stockwell Garage operated routes 11, 77, 87, 88, 93, 118, 155, 170, 315, 322, 432, 670, G1, N11, N44, N87 and N155 History Opened in 1952 after nearly four years of planning and building with many materials short of supply and problems re- housing residents of the houses that stood on the site. Stockwell garage is a listed building, and when built was a masterpiece of architectural design incorporating a new roof structure that did not need supports which enabled for a unobstructed parking space. The offices and workshops are on the edges of the garage but do not take up any of the parking space. In the first few days of operation the garage ran just 11 buses on route 178 which had moved from Rye Lane (Peckham), but then gained more work from the next stage of the tram replacement program for which it had been designed, but it was still well short of capacity. More work arrived in late 1953 and early 1954 when routes 77 and 77A (now 87) moved from Victoria garage due to recruitment problems, and the closure of Nunhead which increased the PVR to 110 buses. In the early 1970s the Round London Sightseeing Tours moved to Stockwell. In 1984 Stockwell was chosen to conduct comparative testing on route 170, consisting of MCW Metrobuses, Leyland Titans, Leyland Olympians, Dennis Dominators, and Volvo Ailsas. The allocation steadied at around 120 for many years, but has increased in the last few years, partially due to taking back full control of route 11 from Waterloo garage. Former garages Mandela Way (MW) As at May 2015, Mandela Way, Bermondsey garage operate routes 1, 453, 521, 624, 658 N1. It was included in the 2009 East Thames Buses purchase. On 28 July 2017, Mandela Way garage was closed with bus routes being transferred to other garages.Mandela Way garage has closed its gates, after nearly 10 years Go- Ahead London August 2017, \\"New garage for Go-Ahead London\\" Buses Magazine issue 750 September 2017 page 24 Belvedere (BV) As at May 2015, Belvedere garage operated routes 180, 244, 669 and N1. History Belvedere was purchased by Harris Bus in 1998 to house its operations that moved from Crayford. Harris Bus went into receivership in 2000, and its routes and garage were taken over by London Buses under the guise of East Thames Buses. East Thames Buses remained a subsidiary of London Buses, taking over routes from defunct operators such as London Easylink's 42 and 185 when this company ceased operating in 2002. Following the move to Mandela Way the engineering is now done there, however limited engineering facilities exist at Belvedere. In October 2009, East Thames Buses was sold to Go-Ahead London. As a result of the purchase by Go-Ahead some route and allocation movements have taken or are due to take place. Even though Belvedere was a London General Garage it operated as a satellite of London Central's Bexleyheath garage. All of Belvedere's engineering and fleet and staff management was done at or organised by Bexleyheath. Belvedere Garage closed on 1 December 2017 when the lease expired. Routes 180 and N1 transferred to the recently opened Morden Wharf bus garage in Greenwich, while Routes 244 and 669 transferred to Bexleyheath.

His most memorable role was Henry Frankenstein, the creator of the monster, in the 1931 film Frankenstein and its 1935 sequel, Bride of Frankenstein. Early life Clive was born in Saint-Malo, France, to an English colonel, Colin Philip Greig, and his wife, Caroline Margaret Lugard Clive. He attended Stonyhurst College and subsequently Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where an injured knee disqualified him from military service and contributed to his becoming a stage actor. Clive created the role of Steve Baker, the white husband of racially mixed Julie LaVerne, in the first London production of Show Boat; the production featured Cedric Hardwicke and Paul Robeson. Clive first worked with James Whale in the Savoy Theatre production of Journey's End and subsequently joined the British community in Hollywood, repeating his stage role in the film version. Hollywood Clive's first screen role, in Journey's End (1930), was also directed by James Whale. Clive played the tormented alcoholic Captain Stanhope, a character that (much like Clive's other roles) mirrored his personal life. He was an in-demand leading man for a number of major film actresses of the era, including Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Corinne Griffith and Jean Arthur. He starred as Edward Rochester in the 1934 adaptation of Jane Eyre opposite Virginia Bruce. He was a descendant of Clive of India and appeared in a featured role in a film biography of his ancestor in 1935. Personal life Clive was rumored to be bisexual. He married Jeanne de Casalis in June 1929, though they were estranged for several years before his death. Death Colin Clive suffered from severe chronic alcoholism and died from complications of tuberculosis in 1937 at age 37. Clive's alcoholism was apparent to his co-stars, as he was often seen napping on set and sometimes was so intoxicated that he had to be held upright for over-the- shoulder shots. Clive was tormented by the medical threat of amputating his long-damaged leg. Forrest J Ackerman recalled visiting Clive's body: \\"I actually saw him in death, lying in a bed at a mortuary where it was possible for the public to view his body. He looked remarkably as he had when lying in bed in The Bride of Frankenstein.\\" Over 300 mourners turned out. One of the pallbearers was Peter Lorre. His cenotaph is located at Chapel of the Pines Crematory. Roles Stage *Peter and Paul (September 1925) *Advertising April (November 1925) * Journey's End (1929) Film *Journey's End (1930) - Capt.

Founded in 1907, it enrolls approximately 1,500 undergraduates and 500 graduate students. History Treadwell Mansion (Oakland, CA) CCA was founded in 1907 by Frederick Meyer in Berkeley as the School of the California Guild of Arts and Crafts during the height of the Arts and Crafts movement. The Arts and Crafts movement originated in Europe during the late 19th century as a response to the industrial aesthetics of the machine age. Followers of the movement advocated an integrated approach to art, design, and craft. Today, Frederick Meyer's \\"practical art school\\" is an internationally known and respected institution, drawing students from around the world. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website () In 1908 the school was renamed California School of Arts and Crafts, and in 1936 it became the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC). The college's Oakland campus location was acquired in 1922, when Meyer bought the four-acre James Treadwell estate at Broadway and College Avenue. Two of its buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places. The Oakland campus still houses the more traditional, craft based studios like the art glass, jewelry metal arts, printmaking, painting, sculpture and ceramic programs. In 1940 a Master of Fine Arts program was established. In 2003 the college changed its name to California College of the Arts. Academics Montgomery Building, San Francisco campus CCA offers 22 undergraduate and 13 graduate majors. CCA confers the bachelor of fine arts (BFA), bachelor of arts (BA), bachelor of architecture (BArch), master of fine arts (MFA), master of arts (MA), master of architecture (MArch), master of advanced architectural design (MAAD), masters of design (MDes) and master of business administration (MBA) degrees. The CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, located near the San Francisco campus in a new facility on Kansas St., is a forum for contemporary culture. In 2013 the Wattis Institute recruited a new director, Anthony Huberman, formerly of Artist's Space in New York. In 2018, U.S. News and World Report listed the California College of the Arts as having the 15th best Fine Arts program in the United States (tied with Stanford University and Temple University).U.S. News PayScale lists CCA as the #1 art school in the United States for return on investment and #4 for average alumni salary (bachelor's degree).PayScale.PayScale.

It is home to historic Wilan√≥w Palace, the \\"Polish Versailles,\\" and second home to various Polish kings. History The first mentions of a settlement in the area can be traced to the 13th century, when a village named Milan√≥w was founded by the Benedictine monastery of P≈Çock. In 1338 it became a private property of the Dukes of Mazovia and in 1378 Prince Janusz I of Warsaw gave it to one of his servants. It was he who established the first mansion and a chapel in the village. His descendants adopted the name Milanowski, after the name of the village. Wilan√≥w Palace as seen from the park by Zygmunt Vogel, 1791-92. In the 17th century the village was bought by the family of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, who started the construction of a new palace; however, the works were stopped by The Deluge when the forces of Sweden captured the area and plundered it completely. In 1676 the depopulated village was bought by King Jan III Sobieski. By his order, Tylman van Gameren and Augustyn Wincenty Locci erected the new baroque-style palaceAugustyn Wincenty Locci, the Author of Wilan√≥w Village at the Wilan√≥w Palace MuseumTylman of Gameren at the Wilan√≥w Palace Museum and St. Anne's Church. Initially the palace was named Villa Nova (New Village), to distinguish it from the nearby village of Stara Wie≈õ (Old Village). However, soon the name was polonised to Wilan√≥w, similar to the former name Milan√≥w. Thanks to the proximity of both the kings' summer residence and the city of Warsaw, Wilan√≥w has for ages been a suburb of Warsaw and a popular holiday spot for Polish magnates. It was also the final point on the historical Royal Road. In the 18th century, the palace became the property of Hetman Adam Miko≈Çaj Sieniawski. His widow, El≈ºbieta Sieniawska, joined the village with the nearby villages of Kabaty, Powsin and . After that both the so-called key of villages (group of villages run together by a common owner) and the palace changed hands several times, with each new owner changing something in the look of the palace. Tortoise-shell cabinet of John III Sobieski, looted by the Germans from the Wilan√≥w Palace during World War II In 1863, after the fall of the January Uprising, the Russian authorities introduced a new administrative division, stripping the key of the rest of villages and making Wilan√≥w a capital of all the communes located south of it. The area became one of the most important providers of food for ever-growing Warsaw and in 1890 a horse-drawn railway was opened for transport of grain and passengers. The line linking Wilan√≥w with Warsaw's Lublin Union Square proved to be a major success and in 1892 the line was extended and started to run steam-drawn trains. Also, new railway stations were built on both ends of the line. After World War II the palaces in Wilan√≥w, Natolin and Morysin were nationalised by the new communist authorities of Poland. The former was converted into a museum and in one of the palace's barracks a Museum of Posters was opened on June 4, 1968. It is probably the only such museum in Europe. In 1951 Wilan√≥w was incorporated into Warsaw. Initially a separate unit of administrative division, in 1976 it was joined with the borough of Mokot√≥w. In 1994 it became a separate unit of administrative division and the following year it became one of the boroughs of Warsaw. Currently, the surrounding area is home to many expatriates living in Warsaw, as this area is home to many international schools. However, in 2000, the American School of Warsaw moved about 6 km out, to the suburb of Konstancin-Jeziorna.

He is a regular columnist for The Times and the author of Paddling to Jerusalem: An Aquatic Tour of Our Small Country (2000), Voodoo Histories: the role of Conspiracy Theory in Modern History (2009) and Party Animals: My Family and Other Communists (2016). He won the Orwell Prize for political journalism in 2001, and the What the Papers Say \\"Columnist of the Year\\" award for 2003. He previously wrote for The Independent and The Guardian.

His parents were atheists whose \\"faith was Marxism\\", according to Aaronovitch, and he is ethnically half Jewish and half Irish. He has written that he was brought up \\"to react to wealth with a puritanical pout\\".Stephen Byers and the sad ghost of new Labour Aaronovitch attended Gospel Oak Primary School until 1965, Holloway County Comprehensive (now Holloway School) The Old Camdenians Club. Retrieved 31 January 2015 until 1968, and William Ellis School from 1968 to 1972, all in London. He studied Modern History at Balliol College, Oxford from October 1973 until April 1974. Aaronovitch completed his education at the Victoria University of Manchester, graduating in 1978 with a 2:1 BA (Hons) in History. While at Manchester, Aaronovitch was a member of the 1975 University Challenge team that lost in the first round after answering most questions with the name of a Marxist (\\"Trotsky\\", \\"Lenin\\", \\"Karl Marx\\" or \\"Che Guevara\\"). The tactics were a protest against the fact that Oxford University and Cambridge University were allowed to enter each of their colleges into the contest as a separate team, even though the colleges were not universities in themselves. Aaronovitch was initially a Eurocommunist, and was active in the National Union of Students (NUS). There he got to know the president at the time, Charles Clarke, who later became Home Secretary. Aaronovitch himself succeeded Trevor Phillips as president of the NUS from 1980 to 1982. He was elected on a Left Alliance ticket.  Career in journalism  Aaranovitch began his media career in the early 1980s as a television researcher and later producer for the ITV programme Weekend World. In 1988, he began working at the BBC as founding editor of the political current affairs programme On the Record. He moved to print journalism in 1995, working for The Independent and Independent on Sunday as chief leader writer, television critic, parliamentary sketch writer and columnist until the end of 2002. He began contributing to The Guardian and The Observer in 2003 as a columnist and feature writer. Aaronovitch's columns appeared in The Guardians G2 section. His desire for his pieces to appear on the main comment pages, according to Peter Wilby, was reportedly vetoed by the section editor, Seumas Milne, although Aaronovitch himself does not know if Milne was involved in the decision. Since June 2005, he has written a regular column for The Times. He has also been a columnist for The Jewish Chronicle. In addition, Aaronovitch has written for a variety of other major British news and opinion publications, such as the New Statesman. In addition, he has written for New Humanist, and is an \\"honorary associate\\" of its publisher, the Rationalist Association. Aaronovitch also presents or contributes to radio and television programmes, including the BBC's Have I Got News for You and BBC News 24. In 2004 he presented The Norman Way, a three-part BBC Radio 4 documentary looking at r√©gime change in 1066. Aaronovitch also hosted the BBC series The Blair Years (2007), which examined the prime ministership of Tony Blair. Some journalists were unimpressed with Aaronovitch or dismissed the series.  Political views  Aaronovitch gave strong support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Since the invasion he has taken the view that it liberated Iraqis, and has played down the significance of Iraq's putative weapons of mass destruction. However, he wrote in 2003: \\"If nothing is eventually found, I ‚Äì as a supporter of the war ‚Äì will never believe another thing that I am told by our government, or that of the US ever again. And, more to the point, neither will anyone else. Those weapons had better be there somewhere.\\" On 7 September 2018, he labelled people who ask him about the article \\"lamebrains\\". He remains a strong supporter of former Prime Minister Tony Blair. In late 2005, Aaronovitch was co-author, with Oliver Kamm and journalist Francis Wheen, of a complaint to The Guardian, after it published an apology to Noam Chomsky for an interview by Emma Brockes, in which she asserted that Chomsky had denied the Srebrenica massacre.The Chomsky Complaint David Aaronovitch's weblog, 20 March 2006. Brockes, Emma (31 October 2005). \\"The Greatest Intellectual?\\", The Guardian (London); the background was that Chomsky complained that Brockes' article was defamatory in implying he denied the fact of the Srebrenica massacre of 1995. The article has since been withdrawn from the Guardian's website, but, as Chomsky is opposed to censorship, it remains available on the official Chomsky website Chomsky.info A Guardian readers' editor found that the newspaper had misrepresented Chomsky's position on the Srebrenica massacre, and that judgement was upheld in May 2006 by an external ombudsman, John Willis.Willis, John (25 May 2006). External Ombudsman Report, The Guardian. In his column of 5 September 2013, Aaronovitch criticised the Labour leader Ed Miliband for providing no alternative to military intervention in Syria, after the use of chemical weapons in the Ghouta attacks of 21 August 2013. For Aaronovitch, \\"politically [Miliband] is not a presence at all, he is an absence\\" and \\"is neither hunter nor prey, he is scavenger.

Aaronovitch later claimed that Brexit would eventually be reversed as the number of older voters, who typically voted for Britain to leave the European Union, gradually die. In 2019, Aaronovitch defended the practice of milkshaking political opponents. In late 2019, Aaronovitch announced on Twitter that he'd fallen victim to an 'elaborate scam'. The scam involved a man pulling up to Aaronovitch on a street in Central london and asking him to hand over hundreds of pounds in exchange for several PVC faux leather jackets, which Aaronovitch duly did.

The lawyer, linguist, philologist Philippe Sarchi was born in Gradisca d'Isonzo. Geography The municipality is located in north-eastern Italy on the right bank of the Isonzo River, about southwest of Gorizia. It received town privileges on 14 July 1936. As of 2011, the population of Gradisca is about 6,580. The town is an important centre of the Friulian culture in the Julian Venetia region.  History  The town's name is a Slavic toponym: in archaic Slovene, gradi≈°ƒçe (cf. gord) was a term indicating a fortified site or a ruin and is a widespread toponym in the Slovene Lands. The strategic important area on the Isonzo River was probably already settled in Roman times and under the Lombard kingdom, later exposed to the attacks by Hungarian forces on Northern Italy. Gradisca Castle The rural settlement of Gradisca is mentioned for the first time in 1176, when it had a mixed population of Slavic and Latin origin. It then belonged to the estate of Farra, held by the Patriarchs of Aquileia. From 1420 onwards their lands were gradually conquered by the Republic of Venice, annexed and incorporated into the Venetian Domini di Terraferma in 1473. The Venetians fortified Gradisca as a bastion against Ottoman raids, then part of a massive defence line along the Isonzo River relying on plans designed by Leonardo da Vinci. During the War of the League of Cambrai against Venice, Gradisca was conquered by Emperor Maximilian I in 1511, and thenceforth it was a Habsburg possession ruled within the County of Gorizia as part of the Inner Austrian lands. In 1615 a Venetian attempt to reconquer it initiated the War of Gradisca. The town was however kept by the Imperial House of Habsburg; in 1647 Emperor Ferdinand III made it the capital of an autonomous County of Gradisca and sold the territory to his confident John Anthony of Eggenberg. The Eggenberg dynasty, formally elevated to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire in 1654, held Gradisca until 1717, enlarging and enriching it constantly as a princely residence. With the extinction of the Eggenbergs, the county returned to the House of Habsburg, being re-united with the remaining County of Gorizia. The union resulted in the creation of the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca in 1754, which existed until the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918. The town remained in the Cisleithanian side after the Compromise of 1867 as head of the district of the same name (GRADISCA), one of the 11 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the Austrian Littoral province.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 During Austrian domination, the town retained its predominantly Italian character. According to the last Austrian census of 1910, 60.0% of the population of the town spoke Italian or Friulian, 13.8% spoke Slovene, and a mere 2.3% spoke German as their first language.http://www.sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:836 In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gradisca fought under Austria-Hungary.

For example, with p = 7, this says that 1716 is one more than a multiple of 343. The theorem was first proved by Joseph Wolstenholme in 1862. In 1819, Charles Babbage showed the same congruence modulo p2, which holds for p \\\\geq 3. An equivalent formulation is the congruence :{ap \\\\choose bp} \\\\equiv {a \\\\choose b} \\\\pmod{p^3} for p \\\\geq 5, which is due to Wilhelm Ljunggren (and, in the special case b = 1, to J. W. L. Glaisher) and is inspired by Lucas' theorem. No known composite numbers satisfy Wolstenholme's theorem and it is conjectured that there are none (see below). A prime that satisfies the congruence modulo p4 is called a Wolstenholme prime (see below). As Wolstenholme himself established, his theorem can also be expressed as a pair of congruences for (generalized) harmonic numbers: :1+{1 \\\\over 2}+{1 \\\\over 3}+...+{1 \\\\over p-1} \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{p^2} \\\\mbox{, and} :1+{1 \\\\over 2^2}+{1 \\\\over 3^2}+...+{1 \\\\over (p-1)^2} \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod p. (Congruences with fractions make sense, provided that the denominators are coprime to the modulus.) For example, with p=7, the first of these says that the numerator of 49/20 is a multiple of 49, while the second says the numerator of 5369/3600 is a multiple of 7.  Wolstenholme primes  A prime p is called a Wolstenholme prime iff the following condition holds: :{{2p-1}\\\\choose{p-1}} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{p^4}. If p is a Wolstenholme prime, then Glaisher's theorem holds modulo p4. The only known Wolstenholme primes so far are 16843 and 2124679 ; any other Wolstenholme prime must be greater than 109. This result is consistent with the heuristic argument that the residue modulo p4 is a pseudo-random multiple of p3. This heuristic predicts that the number of Wolstenholme primes between K and N is roughly ln ln N ‚àí ln ln K. The Wolstenholme condition has been checked up to 109, and the heuristic says that there should be roughly one Wolstenholme prime between 109 and 1024. A similar heuristic predicts that there are no \\"doubly Wolstenholme\\" primes, for which the congruence would hold modulo p5.  A proof of the theorem  There is more than one way to prove Wolstenholme's theorem. Here is a proof that directly establishes Glaisher's version using both combinatorics and algebra. For the moment let p be any prime, and let a and b be any non-negative integers. Then a set A with ap elements can be divided into a rings of length p, and the rings can be rotated separately. Thus, the a-fold direct sum of the cyclic group of order p acts on the set A, and by extension it acts on the set of subsets of size bp. Every orbit of this group action has pk elements, where k is the number of incomplete rings, i.e., if there are k rings that only partly intersect a subset B in the orbit. There are \\\\textstyle {a \\\\choose b} orbits of size 1 and there are no orbits of size p. Thus we first obtain Babbage's theorem :{ap \\\\choose bp} \\\\equiv {a \\\\choose b} \\\\pmod{p^2}. Examining the orbits of size p2, we also obtain :{ap \\\\choose bp} \\\\equiv {a \\\\choose b} + {a \\\\choose 2}\\\\left({2p \\\\choose p} - 2\\\\right){a -2 \\\\choose b-1} \\\\pmod{p^3}. Among other consequences, this equation tells us that the case a=2 and b=1 implies the general case of the second form of Wolstenholme's theorem. Switching from combinatorics to algebra, both sides of this congruence are polynomials in a for each fixed value of b. The congruence therefore holds when a is any integer, positive or negative, provided that b is a fixed positive integer. In particular, if a=-1 and b=1, the congruence becomes :{-p \\\\choose p} \\\\equiv {-1 \\\\choose 1} + {-1 \\\\choose 2}\\\\left({2p \\\\choose p} - 2\\\\right) \\\\pmod{p^3}. This congruence becomes an equation for \\\\textstyle {2p \\\\choose p} using the relation :{-p \\\\choose p} = \\\\frac{(-1)^p}2{2p \\\\choose p}. When p is odd, the relation is :3{2p \\\\choose p} \\\\equiv 6 \\\\pmod{p^3}. When p‚â†3, we can divide both sides by 3 to complete the argument. A similar derivation modulo p4 establishes that :{ap \\\\choose bp} \\\\equiv {a \\\\choose b} \\\\pmod{p^4} for all positive a and b if and only if it holds when a=2 and b=1, i.e., if and only if p is a Wolstenholme prime.  The converse as a conjecture  It is conjectured that if when k=3, then n is prime. The conjecture can be understood by considering k = 1 and 2 as well as 3. When k = 1, Babbage's theorem implies that it holds for n = p2 for p an odd prime, while Wolstenholme's theorem implies that it holds for n = p3 for p > 3, and it holds for n = p4 if p is a Wolstenholme prime. When k = 2, it holds for n = p2 if p is a Wolstenholme prime. These three numbers, 4 = 22, 8 = 23, and 27 = 33 are not held for () with k = 1, but all other prime square and prime cube are held for () with k = 1. Only 5 other composite values (neither prime square nor prime cube) of n are known to hold for () with k = 1, they are called Wolstenholme pseudoprimes, they are :27173, 2001341, 16024189487, 80478114820849201, 20378551049298456998947681, ... The first three are not prime powers , the last two are 168434 and 21246794, 16843 and 2124679 are Wolstenholme primes . Besides, with an exception of 168432 and 21246792, no composites are known to hold for () with k = 2, much less k = 3. Thus the conjecture is considered likely because Wolstenholme's congruence seems over- constrained and artificial for composite numbers. Moreover, if the congruence does hold for any particular n other than a prime or prime power, and any particular k, it does not imply that :{an \\\\choose bn} \\\\equiv {a \\\\choose b} \\\\pmod{n^k}.  Generalizations  Leudesdorf has proved that for a positive integer n coprime to 6, the following congruence holds: : \\\\sum_{i=1\\\\atop (i,n)=1}^{n-1} \\\\frac{1}{i} \\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{n^2}.

After a gap year working on a kibbutz in Israel with the Labour Zionist Habonim Dror, he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Wadham College, Oxford. While at Oxford, he was editor of Cherwell, the student newspaper. Journalism The younger Freedland began his Fleet Street career at the short-lived Sunday Correspondent. In 1990 he joined the BBC as a news reporter across radio and television, including for The World at One and Today on Radio 4. In 1992, he was awarded the Laurence Stern fellowship on The Washington Post, serving as a staff writer on national news. He was Washington Correspondent for The Guardian from 1993 until 1997, when he returned to London as an editorial writer and columnist. Between 2002 and 2004, Freedland was an occasional columnist for the Daily Mirror and from 2005 to 2007 he wrote a weekly column for the London Evening Standard. He writes a monthly column for The Jewish Chronicle. He has also been published in The New York Times, The New York Review of Books, Newsweek and The New Republic. Freedland was named 'Columnist of the Year' in the 2002 What the Papers Say awards and in 2008 was awarded the David Watt Prize for Journalism, in recognition of his essay \\"Bush's Amazing Achievement\\", published in The New York Review of Books. Nominated on seven occasions, Freedland was awarded a special Orwell Prize in May 2014 for his journalism.Williams, Martin (21 May 2014), \\"Two Guardian journalists win Orwell prize for journalism\\", The Guardian.Katie Rosseinsky, Kate (21 May 2014), \\"Double win for Alan Johnson as This Boy receives the Orwell Prize\\", The Daily Telegraph. In 2016, he won the \\"Commentariat of the Year\\" prize at the Comment Awards. Freedland was executive editor of the opinion section of The Guardian from May 2014 till early 2016 and continues to write a Saturday column for it.Jason Deans \\"Janine Gibson appointed editor-in- chief of theguardian.com\\", theguardian.com, 7 March 2014 In November 2019, Freedland apologised for making a \\"very bad error\\" in falsely reporting that a shortlisted Labour Prospective parliamentary candidate had been fined for making antisemitic remarks on Facebook. He attributed the mistaken identification by confusing two lawyers with the same name to a \\"previously reliable Labour source\\" whose information he had \\"passed on too hastily\\". Author Freedland has published ten books: two non-fiction works under his own name and eight novels, seven of them under the pseudonym Sam Bourne. Bring Home the Revolution: The case for a British Republic (1998), Freedland's first book, argued that Britain should reclaim the revolutionary ideals it exported to America in the 18th century, and undergo a constitutional and cultural overhaul. The book won a W. Somerset Maugham Award for non-fiction and was later adapted into a two-part series for BBC Television. Jacob's Gift (2005) is a memoir recounting the lives of three generations of his own Jewish family as well as exploring wider questions of identity and belonging.Anthony Juluius \\"The bearers of memory\\", The Guardian, 19 February 2005 In 2008, he broadcast a two-part series for BBC Radio 4 ‚Äì British Jews and the Dream of Zion ‚Äì as well as two TV documentaries for BBC Four: How to be a Good President and President Hollywood. The Righteous Men (2006), is a religious thriller published under the Bourne nom de plume. It is about a news reporter whose life is disrupted when his wife is kidnapped while he is reporting a story of a militia man found dead. As more murders of 'righteous men' happen across the globe, Will soon finds himself in the middle of a plot to bring about nothing less than Judgement Day. The book was followed by another Sam Bourne title, The Last Testament (2007), set against the backdrop of the Middle East peace process. It draws on the author's experiences in that region as a reporter for over twenty years, and a Guardian newspaper sponsored dialogue which was influential in the 2003 Geneva Accords. The central character finds herself involved in a mix of the modern political situation and ancient revelations. The Final Reckoning (2008), was based on the true story of the Avengers: a group of Holocaust survivors who sought revenge against their Nazi persecutors, and just missed the peak of The Sunday Times best-seller list. Just before The Chosen One (2010), the fourth thriller by Sam Bourne was published in the UK, The Bookseller reported in April 2010 that HarperCollins had signed Freedland for three more Bourne books. HarperCollins published \\"Pantheon\\" in July 2012. Freedland's sixth novel, The 3rd Woman, was published by HarperCollins in 2015. His sixth Bourne novel, To Kill a President, was published by HarperCollins on 4 July 2017. The seventh novel under the Sam Bourne pseudonym, To Kill the Truth, was published in February 2019. Views Israel, Zionism and antisemitism A leading liberal Zionist in the UK,Lerman, Antony (22 August 2014), \\"The End of Liberal Zionism: Israel‚Äôs Move to the Right Challenges Diaspora Jews\\", New York Times. he wrote in 2012 that he uses the word Zionism infrequently, as the word has been misunderstood and has become defined as right-wing.Freedland, Jonathan (18 July 2012), \\"Yearning for the same land\\", New Statesman. On the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, he believes that military action perpetuates conflict and has called for negotiations to end the cycles of violence. He defends Israel's right to exist despite the disposession of the Palestinians, but hopes that Israel will recognise the 'high price' paid by Palestinians. Freedland has accused the Labour Party in the UK of being in denial on the issue of antisemitism. He has urged the left to treat Jews \\"the same way you‚Äôd treat any other minority\\". He has also commented on the perceived antisemitic expressions of Palestinians with whom Corbyn has associated and expressed the view that many of the Labour Party's new members were hostile to Jews. Freedland has attracted some criticism for his views. Other issues Freedland was critical of the role of the local authority and management company in the period leading up to the Grenfell Tower fire.\\"Grenfell Tower will forever stand as a rebuke to the right\\", The Guardian. He believes that the British public are tired of the duration and impact of austerity.Freedland, Jonathan (21 June 2017), \\"Here‚Äôs what the Queen‚Äôs speech needed to say ‚Äì but didn't\\", The Guardian. He is concerned that the impact of Hurricane Harvey in the United States received more publicity than more serious events in Asia. Freedland is also concerned about the war in Yemen and the role of western governments in supplying weapons to Saudi Arabia.Freedland, Jonathan (1 September 2017), \\"There's a disaster much worse than Texas. But no one talks about it\\", The Guardian. He maintains that reduced police funding enables terrorism in the United Kingdom and blames the large Internet companies for not preventing the spread of terrorist material.Freedland, Jonathan (20 September 2017), \\"It isn‚Äôt just tech giants that disown responsibility for terrorist attacks\\", The Guardian. Personal life Freedland is married to Sarah Peters, a radio and podcast producer. They have two sons, Jacob and Sam, and conform to Conservative Judaism.

Put more simply, it tries to do the following without changing the meaning of the code: * Avoid pipeline stalls by rearranging the order of instructions. * Avoid illegal or semantically ambiguous operations (typically involving subtle instruction pipeline timing issues or non-interlocked resources). The pipeline stalls can be caused by structural hazards (processor resource limit), data hazards (output of one instruction needed by another instruction) and control hazards (branching).  Data hazards  Instruction scheduling is typically done on a single basic block. In order to determine whether rearranging the block's instructions in a certain way preserves the behavior of that block, we need the concept of a data dependency. There are three types of dependencies, which also happen to be the three data hazards: # Read after Write (RAW or \\"True\\"): Instruction 1 writes a value used later by Instruction 2. Instruction 1 must come first, or Instruction 2 will read the old value instead of the new. # Write after Read (WAR or \\"Anti\\"): Instruction 1 reads a location that is later overwritten by Instruction 2. Instruction 1 must come first, or it will read the new value instead of the old. # Write after Write (WAW or \\"Output\\"): Two instructions both write the same location. They must occur in their original order. Technically, there is a fourth type, Read after Read (RAR or \\"Input\\"): Both instructions read the same location. Input dependence does not constrain the execution order of two statements, but it is useful in scalar replacement of array elements. To make sure we respect the three types of dependencies, we construct a dependency graph, which is a directed graph where each vertex is an instruction and there is an edge from I1 to I2 if I1 must come before I2 due to a dependency. If loop-carried dependencies are left out, the dependency graph is a directed acyclic graph. Then, any topological sort of this graph is a valid instruction schedule. The edges of the graph are usually labelled with the latency of the dependence. This is the number of clock cycles that needs to elapse before the pipeline can proceed with the target instruction without stalling.  Algorithms  The simplest algorithm to find a topological sort is frequently used and is known as list scheduling. Conceptually, it repeatedly selects a source of the dependency graph, appends it to the current instruction schedule and removes it from the graph. This may cause other vertices to be sources, which will then also be considered for scheduling. The algorithm terminates if the graph is empty. To arrive at a good schedule, stalls should be prevented. This is determined by the choice of the next instruction to be scheduled. A number of heuristics are in common use: * The processor resources used by the already scheduled instructions are recorded. If a candidate uses a resource that is occupied, its priority will drop. * If a candidate is scheduled closer to its predecessors than the associated latency, its priority will drop. * If a candidate lies on the critical path of the graph, its priority will rise. This heuristic provides some form of look- ahead in an otherwise local decision process. * If choosing a candidate will create many new sources, its priority will rise. This heuristic tends to generate more freedom for the scheduler.  Phase order  Instruction scheduling may be done either before or after register allocation or both before and after it. The advantage of doing it before register allocation is that this results in maximum parallelism. The disadvantage of doing it before register allocation is that this can result in the register allocator needing to use a number of registers exceeding those available. This will cause spill/fill code to be introduced, which will reduce the performance of the section of code in question. If the architecture being scheduled has instruction sequences that have potentially illegal combinations (due to a lack of instruction interlocks), the instructions must be scheduled after register allocation. This second scheduling pass will also improve the placement of the spill/fill code. If scheduling is only done after register allocation, then there will be false dependencies introduced by the register allocation that will limit the amount of instruction motion possible by the scheduler.  Types  There are several types of instruction scheduling: #Local (basic block) scheduling: instructions can't move across basic block boundaries. #Global scheduling: instructions can move across basic block boundaries. #Modulo scheduling: an algorithm for generating software pipelining, which is a way of increasing instruction level parallelism by interleaving different iterations of an inner loop. #Trace scheduling: the first practical approach for global scheduling, trace scheduling tries to optimize the control flow path that is executed most often. #Superblock scheduling: a simplified form of trace scheduling which does not attempt to merge control flow paths at trace \\"side entrances\\". Instead, code can be implemented by more than one schedule, vastly simplifying the code generator.  Compiler examples  The GNU Compiler Collection is one compiler known to perform instruction scheduling, using the (both instruction set and scheduling) or (only scheduling) flags. It uses descriptions of instruction latencies and what instructions can be run in parallel (or equivalently, which \\"port\\" each use) for each microarchitecture to perform the task. This feature is available to almost all architectures that GCC supports. Until version 12.0.0, the instruction scheduling in LLVM/Clang could only accept a (called in LLVM parlance) switch for both instruction set and scheduling. Version 12 adds support for () for x86 only. Sources of information on latency and port usage include: * GCC and LLVM; * Agner Fog, who compiles extensive data for the x86 architecture; * InstLatx64, which uses AIDA64 to collect data on x86 CPUs. See also the \\"Comments\\" link on the page. LLVM's should be usable on all machines, especially to gather information on non-x86 ones.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1999, and a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1997. Driedger was born in Steinbach, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba. He returned to the Steinbach area after graduation, and worked as a real estate broker and farmer. In 1958, Driedger married Mary Penner. Between 1967 and 1972, he served as reeve of the municipality of Hanover. He was also a director of the Elim Mennonite Church. On July 15, 1970, his frog Georges won the First International Frog Jumping Championship in St. Pierre-Jolys, Manitoba, as part of a series of festivities surrounding a royal visit. Driedger was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1977 as a Progressive Conservative, defeating incumbent New Democrat Steve Derewianchuk by about 1000 votes in the rural southeastern riding of Emerson. In his first term, he served as a backbench MLA supporting the Progressive Conservative government of Sterling Lyon. The NDP defeated Lyon's government in the 1981 provincial election, although Driedger was able to retain Emerson by 356 votes over his NDP challenger Paul Dupuis. He was re-elected by a greater majority in the 1986 election, which the NDP won by a narrow margin. In 1988, disgruntled NDP backbencher Jim Walding brought down his government and forced a new election. Driedger was again re-elected without difficulty, and was appointed Minister of Government Services and Minister of Highways and Transportation on May 9, 1988. Following the redistribution of provincial electoral districts for the 1990 election, Driedger ran in the riding of Steinbach; he once again won without any difficulty. He lost his position as government services minister on February 5, 1991, and on September 10, 1993, was transferred from highways and transportation to the Ministry of Natural Resources. Once again, he experienced no difficulties in the 1995 provincial election. He supported Jean Charest's bid to lead the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1993 (Winnipeg Free Press, 12 June 1993). Driedger was dropped from cabinet on January 6, 1997, and did not seek re-election in 1999. After leaving politics, he was chairman of the board for the Menno Home for the Aged in Grunthal. Driedger died on July 18, 2011, at the age of 75, days after suffering a stroke.

It is a remake of the 1967 film of the same name, written by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, which was itself a comic retelling of the Faust legend. Plot The Devil runs a computer simulation to analyze souls to determine individual weaknesses to exploit. The program settles on Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser), a geeky, over-zealous man working a dead-end job in a San Francisco computer company. He has no friends and his co-workers avoid him. He has a crush on colleague Alison Gardner (Frances O'Connor), but lacks the courage to ask her out. After Elliot is ditched by his co-workers at a bar while trying to talk to Alison, he says he would give anything for Alison to be with him. The Devil, in the form of a beautiful woman (Elizabeth Hurley), overhears him and offers to give Elliot seven wishes in exchange for his soul. As a test, Elliot wishes for a Big Mac and a large Coke. The Devil takes him to McDonald's and places the order. Elliot has to pay for it, because, \\"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.\\" After taking Elliot to her office, based at a nightclub in Oakland, the Devil convinces Elliot to sign her contract, and delivers further wishes. Each wish has Elliot living them out with Alison and his co-workers in surrogate roles. However, the Devil always spoils his wishes by adding something he does not expect or want. After going through five wishes, Elliot is arrested after confessing his story to a priest who believed he was drunk. The Devil, dressed as a police officer, throws him in a cell, telling him that she likes him, and it would not hurt to have her as a friend. Elliot's cellmate tells him that he cannot sell his soul as it belongs to God, and although the Devil may try to confuse him, in the end he will realize who he truly is, and what his purpose is. Elliot questions the man as to his identity, but the response is simply \\"a really good friend\\". Elliot asks the Devil to cancel their contract. When the Devil refuses, Elliot states he will not use his final wish. The Devil teleports them to Hell. When the Devil pushes him to make a final wish, Elliot wishes that Alison could have a happy life - with or without him. The Devil sighs and Elliot falls into the depths of Hell. He wakes up on a marble staircase, wondering if it is Heaven. The Devil tells him that a provision in the contract's fine print states that a selfless wish voids the contract. Elliot admits that despite her manipulation of him he has come to like the Devil and regards her as a friend. She advises that Heaven and Hell can be found on Earth; it is up to humans to choose. Elliot asks Alison out, but discovers she is already dating another man. He continues with his life, with a better understanding of who he is. Elliot is confronted by Bob, one of his co-workers, who ridicules Elliot at the encouragement of his co-workers. Elliot grabs a terrified Bob by the shirt, but lets go, simply saying, \\"Nice talking to you.\\" At home, he meets a new neighbor, Nicole, whose looks resemble Alison's but whose personality, interests and fashion sense are much closer to his. He offers to help her unpack and they begin a relationship. While the two walk along a boulevard, the Devil and Elliot's cellmate, both dressed in white, are playing chess. The Devil's computer program lists Nicole and Elliot's foibles, which they tolerate. Cast * Brendan Fraser as Elliot Richards / Jefe / \\"Mary\\" / Abraham Lincoln * Elizabeth Hurley as The Devil * Frances O'Connor as Alison Gardner / Nicole Delarusso * Orlando Jones as Daniel / Dan / Danny / Esteban / Beach Jock / Lamar Garrett / Dr. Ngegitigegitibaba * Paul Adelstein as Bob / Roberto / Beach Jock / Bob Bob * Toby Huss as Jerry / Alejandro / Beach Jock / Jerry Turner / Lance * Miriam Shor as Carol / Penthouse Hostess * Gabriel Casseus as God * Brian Doyle- Murray as Priest * Jeff Doucette as Desk Sergeant * Aaron Lustig as Synedyne Supervisor * Rudolf Martin as Raoul * Julian Firth as John Wilkes Booth Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. Hurley's performance was praised, but her attendance of its premiere was met with backlash from the Screen Actors Guild because it occurred during a strike it was holding. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote, disappointedly, that \\"'Bedazzled' recycled is not the finest hour for Fraser or Hurley‚Äîthough Fraser, Elliot Richards in this movie, comes closer. It isn't Ramis' finest hour either‚Äîthough he's one American moviemaker who excels at concept comedies, as he's proved in 'Groundhog Day' and 'Dave' and the best parts of the crude and lewd 'Caddyshack.' 'Bedazzled,' one of the best comic premises ever, should have been duck soup to him.\\" Wilmington's rival, the Chicago Sun- Times Roger Ebert, commented that \\"the new movie has been directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay that uses the 1967 film more as inspiration than source. It is lacking in wickedness. It doesn't smack its lips when it's naughty. When its hero sells his soul to the devil, what results isn't diabolical effrontery, but a series of contract negotiations and consumer complaints. This is twice in two weeks (after the Winona Ryder exorcism movie \\"Lost Souls\\") that Satan loses on points.\\" The Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan stated that \\"as written by Larry Gelbart, director Harold Ramis and Peter Tolan, this 'Bedazzled,' though amusing from moment to moment, is erratic, unfocused and uncertain where it's going. And whenever it gets too insecure about itself, the film falls back, in classic the-devil-made-me-do-it Hollywood fashion, on explosions, gunfights, helicopter stunts, car crashes and computer-generated effects. What should be a drawing-room comedy ends with moments best left to 'Gone in 60 Seconds.'\\" On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 49% based on 113 reviews, with an average of 5.5/10. The site's general consensus states: \\"Though it has its funny moments, this remake is essentially a one joke movie with too many flat plots, and not a patch on the superior original.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 49 out of 100 based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The film did reasonably well at the box office. It topped British box office sales when it debuted in the UK during the weekend of 10 November 2000, and finished at #2 on its American opening weekend behind the surprise smash hit Meet the Parents.

Situated between Austinmer and Bulli, it is approximately 13 kilometres north of Wollongong, and 69 km south of Sydney. It lies between the Pacific Ocean and a section of the Illawarra escarpment known as Lady Fuller Park, adjacent to Bulli Pass Scenic Reserve. History View of George Street, date unknown Before European settlement, Wodi Wodi Aborigines inhabited the area known then as Thurrural, meaning \\"The Valley of the Cabbage Tree Palms\\". Cabbage tree palms were once plentiful in the area. Early white settlers used cabbage tree palms to make strong fence posts. The trees are still present on either side of Bulli Pass. Early settlement began in the late 1860s in the hilly area of the village as the lower beachside area was swampy and susceptible to flooding with high tides sometimes combining with heavy rain. Occupations consisted of farming, cedar logging, whaling and fruit growing and eventually mining when the Bulli Mine was opened in 1859 and the Bulli Jetty which shipped the coal from the mine opened in 1863. The township was known as North Bulli until February 1880 when the name of Robbinsville was chosen. The new name was decided upon at a meeting of ten men (including Frederick Robbins) in George's Whitford's \\"big new House\\" (located on the site of today's Ryans Hotel) in 1880. One suggestion for a name for the place was \\"Mudmire\\" but somehow Robbins convinced the others to call the town after himself. It only had a total population of 490 in 1891. The town was then known as Robbinsville until 1892, when the name \\"Thirroul\\" was officially adopted by the Railways Department - most probably due to the influence of the politician Archibald Campbell who was also then owner and editor of the Illawarra Mercury who included both the names \\"Thirroul (\\"cabbage tree\\") and \\"Throon\\" (\\"bush leech - 'blackfellow doctor'\\") in a still-extant list of Aboriginal words he compiled in the early 1890s. The name \\"Thirroul\\", however, appears to be a misnomer. William Saddler (a well known Aboriginal elder from Port Kembla) contacted the Illawarra Mercury newspaper and complained about the \\"meaningless\\" name. He said the area was called \\"Throon\\" which meant \\"Bush leech\\". Saddler claims Aboriginal people warned their children about the large number of leeches found high on the escarpment near the site of what would later become the Excelsior Colliery. In 1888 the rail link with Sydney was finished. Early construction workers on the railway caused a population increase, and the eastern side of the town progressed rapidly. The Thirroul Locomotive Depot opened in 1917. It closed in 1965 and only the barracks for the accommodation of the railway crews remain. The Railway Institute Hall (opened in 1920) where workers once studied has been classified as a heritage building. The construction of the rail link also created an increase in tourism for Thirroul. It became a popular family seaside holiday destination with boarding houses and holiday cottages in demand. Two known early residents include Samuel McCauley and Frederick Robbins. McCauley was one of the oldest residents of the Illawarra district when he died in June 1899 in Thirroul. A street in Thirroul has been named McCauley street. Robbins was a prominent resident who gave his name to the township of North Bulli as it was then called. He was made the first postmaster of Robbinsville in 1888 after, along with other residents, lobbying the government to supply a post office and railway platform. In 1898 the Amy was shipwrecked on the rocks at the southern end of Thirroul beach. All of its crew died. A memorial plaque to the Amy and her crew is located in the Thirroul Beach Park. Coal mining operations began at the start of the 20th century and miners needed residences, though logging had been occurring before for some time. Thirroul circa 1920 showing the town as it was described by D. H Lawrence. The world-famous English author, D. H. Lawrence visited Thirroul in 1922 and wrote the novel Kangaroo about Australian fringe politics after the First World War whilst there. Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, his house Wyewurk is the earliest Australian bungalow to show the influence of the Californian Bungalow style of architecture. He gave this description of the town: \\"... The town trailed down from the foot of the mountain towards the railway, a huddle of grey and red painted iron roofs. Then over the rail line towards the sea, it began again in a spasmodic fashion ... There were wide unmade roads running straight as to go nowhere, with little bungalow homes ... Then quite near the inland, rose a great black wall of mountain or cliff ...\\". A park and a monument (dedicated 21 November 1988) commemorate D H Lawrence's time at Thirroul in 1922 when he wrote the novel \\"Kangaroo\\". The book D.H. Lawrence at Thirroul by lifelong Thirroul resident Joseph Davis was published by Collins (Sydney) in 1989 and questioned many of the assumptions made by Robert Darroch in his 1981 work entitled \\"D.H. Lawrence in Australia\\" published by Macmillan (Melbourne). The Cambridge edition of Kangaroo (edited by Bruce Steele) tended to accept the views of Davis rather than those of Darroch. Davis has gone on to write numerous articles and a number of books about art and the environment in Thirroul and the local area, including \\"Greetings from Thirroul\\" (1994), \\"Greetings from Wollongong\\" (1995), \\"The Illawarra Society of Artists\\" (2001), \\"Lake Illawarra: an ongoing history\\" (2005), \\"John Brown of Brownsville\\" (2011), \\"Gooseberry & Hooka\\" (2012),\\"One Hundred Seasons\\" (2014), \\"Wobbly Wollongong\\" (2016), \\"The Real Alexander Harris\\" (2018) and \\"Rachel Henning and Deighton Taylor in Illawarra 1853-1896\\" (2019). Michael Bialoguski, later to become a prominent player in the Petrov Affair (1954) and later still an orchestral conductor in the UK and Europe, had a medical practice in Thirroul in the late 1940s. The artist Brett Whiteley died from a heroin overdose in the Beachside Motel in Thirroul on 15 June 1992, aged 53. The artist Paul Ryan is a long- term resident of Thirroul, as is the artist Frank Nowlan. The Thirroul Village Committee (TVC) was formed in 1983 because, in the words of Don Gray, \\"the town was looking rather tatty\\" and something needed to be done. Don was the founding Chairperson and Lynne Jones, the founding Secretary. In 1983 the population of less than 5,000 qualified Thirroul as a village. In 1993 the TVC won the Basil Ryan gold award at the Rise & Shine Awards presentation for improved streetscapes. The Thirroul Seaside and Arts Festival, which is a successful community event, was the idea of Don Gray. The first festival was run in 1993. Lynne Jones organised the Festival for many years, building to the point where it was handed over to the Lions Club. Another community event was \\"the Growing Green Kids Festival' ‚Äì a not-for-profit event which was the brain-child of resident Cate Wilson (1948‚Äì2012). Cate was also President of the Thirroul Action Group (TAG) - an environmental group which has functioned for around 30 years. Residents concerned about health risks picketed against the Telstra phone tower in 1997. Storms and floods severely affected the Thirroul area in August 1998. In August 2007, Thirroul's CBD and beach was declared an alcohol free zone as a council initiative to prevent public drinking on streets and footpaths within the designated area. A local developer, John Comelli, re-opened the old King's Picture Theatre In Thirroul as Anita's Theatre in 2007 after a lavish refurbishment. In June 2011 the theatre was purchased for $1.05 million by a consortium headed by Rennie Cristini. A buyer from Sydney with a \\"vested interest in theatre\\" is the new owner of Anita's Theatre in Thirroul. In 2013, the property sold for $1.4million ‚Äì $350,000 more than its last sale price in 2011\\" according to the Illawarra Mercury. (Illawarra Mercury 15 November 2013). Thirroul resident Don Gray has released (June 2011) a self-published book of his memories called My Thirroul illustrated by local artist, Christine Hill. A children's playground was opened by Wollongong Council with a plaque carrying their names on 4 July 2012. Some of the art work evokes Gray's memories of an elephant stuck in the former Thirroul Beach lagoon on the current site of the playground ‚Äì a story he recalled (and which Christine Hill illustrated) in his book. Gray died on 28 April 2013, aged 93 (Illawarra Mercury, 30 April 2013).  Heritage listings  Thirroul has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Illawarra railway: Thirroul railway station Commerce & services The town's major commercial area lies between an area just north of Bulli Pass, where the Princes Highway splits to form the Lawrence Hargrave Drive, to Thirroul Station, over the bridge and past the main centre and the Anita's Theatre building. Supermarkets include a Coles and IGA. Thirroul is steadily growing in population, and many new shops are added regularly. Many cafes now exist in Thirroul's main commercial area, adding to its popularity as a seaside holiday town. The Beaches Hotel (originally the Thirroul Rex Hotel)Roberts M. The Beaches Hotel, Thirroul. Looking Back. Retrieved 7 December 2017. and Ryans Hotel are lively pubs for locals and tourists alike, both located on the main road. Thirroul has many fashion, gift & lifestyle shops along the main streets. Thirroul is also home to King's Theatre (1913), which underwent large-scale renovations in 2006/2007 and was renamed to Anita's Theatre by the developer John Comelli, in honour of his late wife. Anita's Theatre was for sale as of May 2010 but was purchased for 1.05 million dollars in 2011 by a consortium of Italian investors. The boutique clothing and jewellery shops, florists, conveniences stores, news agencies and other shopping essentials make it the main shopping area for the northern suburbs of Wollongong. Thirroul also has a sub-branch of the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL). Thirroul is part of the Northern Illawarra Chamber of Commerce, which was established in 1996 and is recognised as an official body by the Wollongong City Council. Its aim is to promote the identity of the Northern Illawarra in co-operation with local business owners, the residents community, and government and tourism bodies to generate local business growth for the region. There are two primary schools, St. Michael's and Thirroul Public School. St. Michael's is a Catholic school that was established by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1940 and is located in Station Street. The current principal is Mrs. Belinda Hughes. Thirroul Public school was established in 1889 after Frederick Robbins sold one acre of his land, \\"well situated and elevated, being the centre of population\\", to the Department of Education for the purpose of building a school and teacher's residence. The school subsequently opened in 1889 with 154 children on the roll. Thirroul Public School is located in Roxburgh Avenue. The current principal is Mr. Gary Graham. Thirroul also has a Thirroul Scout Group as part of the Scout Association of Australia, NSW Branch. In June 2009, the new Thirroul District Library and Community centre was opened. This library offers email and word processing, inter-library loans, photocopying and printing, free Internet access and children's programs. The annual Thirroul Seaside & Arts Festival is held over a weekend in the first week of April. It includes activities such as art exhibitions and workshops, kids activities, live stage entertainment, buskers, a variety of stalls, pony and carnival rides and face painting. The festival won the 2003 Illawarra tourism Award in the events/festivals category. Involved in organising the event is the Austimer-Thirroul Lions Club. The festival actively involves community organisations, educational institutions, sporting groups, performing and visual art studios, scouts, surf lifesavers and the general public.  Demographics  In the , there were 6,083 people in Thirroul. 79.9% of residents were born in Australia compared to 72.7% for the Wollongong Local Government LGA. The next most common countries of birth in Thirroul were England at 5.5% and New Zealand at 1.7%. In addition, 89.7% of the Thirroul population only spoke English in the home, compared with 78.2% for the Wollongong LGA. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 37.8%, Catholic 24.4% and Anglican 16.7%. The median weekly household income for Thirroul was $1,947 which is higher than the Wollongong LGA median of $1339. Levels of qualification in Thirroul are also higher than the Wollongong LGA, with 60% of population completing tertiary education compared with an average of 47% across the LGA. Of the employed people in Thirroul, 5.0% worked in Higher Education. Other major industries of employment included Hospitals 4.8%, Secondary Education 4.0% and Primary Education 4.0%. Many former Sydneysiders have moved to Thirroul and now commute to work from the northern area and real estate prices have become ridiculously expensive. The price of a now near derelict house with ocean glimpses in Spray Street Thirroul increased from $80,000 in 1986 to selling for $1,560,000 on 7 May 2016 - an increase of some 1900%. Average Weekly Earnings have simply not kept pace with such dramatic rises. Few employment opportunities exist in the suburb with much of the labour force commuting to Sydney for work.  Transport  Thirroul railway station is a major station on the South Coast railway. Although not as important as in steam days, it is the major station between Wollongong and the Sydney metropolitan area. Local Wollongong suburban services terminate at Thirroul, while all express intercity services stop at Thirroul. Passenger services are provided by NSW TrainLink. Thirroul retains a number of passing / refuge sidings for the many coal trains from Metropolitan Colliery and the western coalfields which pass through the town. Entrance to the railway station Thirroul is served by express and all stations trains on the NSW TrainLink South Coast line. All trains stop at Thirroul. In 2005, the station was equipped with lifts. Lawrence Hargrave Drive starts just south of Thirroul at the Princes Highway in Bulli and travels north through Thirroul, connecting with the Old Princes Highway and Southern Freeway at the Helensburgh exit.  Thirroul Beach  Thirroul beach is a prominent feature, as well as the backdrop of the 400 metre (1,300 ft) high escarpment, attracting many bush-walkers to northern Austinmer and surfers to both beaches. The beach is popular with both locals and tourists, becoming particularly busy in summer months and long weekends. The beach is 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) long and backed by a large, grassy reserve. Swimming can be potentially hazardous because of permanent and shifting rips. The beach is patrolled in summer and a 50 metres (160 ft) ocean pool is located near the beach. The Thirroul Surf Lifesaving Club was established in 1907 as one of 14 foundation clubs in NSW. There have also been complaints of under-age drinking, noise and anti-social behaviour occurring on Thirroul Beach Park after dark, especially in the summer months. Former Ironman champions Darren and Dean Mercer are from Thirroul and their parents still reside in the town.leftThe SLSC is the home of the Thirroul Seagulls IRB (inflatable rescue boat) Racing Team, who have competed strongly for the last 15 years. Aerial photo from north west Thirroul is an exposed beach and reef break, and has reliable surf all year. The most desirable wind for surfing there is offshore winds from the west north-west. Most of the surf comes from |groundswells, with the best swell direction the south-east. The beach break provides for both left and right-handers. Caution should be taken with rips, rocks, sharks and, during the summer, bluebottles.  Natural environment and wildlife  The Sandon Point Stockland development, has given rise to much controversy and conflict between developers and environmental and Aboriginal groups over Aboriginal heritage and coastal wetland and floodplain since 1989, is just south in Bulli. Dootch Kennedy, Al Oshlack and Karen Gough have co- ordinated a series of legal actions against the development's impact on Aboriginal heritage. This protest is ongoing, and included a 24/7 picket for five years before an arson attack, and a continuing Aboriginal Tent Embassy. Resident Jill Walker has been heroic in taking Stockland and the Minister for Planning to both the Land and Environment and Supreme Courts over a number of outstanding non-Aboriginal environmental issues relating to the development. It is also the starting/finishing point to the bike track that runs south to Wollongong, the Wollongong to Thirroul Bike Track. The escarpment area is rich in its variety of birdlife. Recorded birds in the northern suburbs of Wollongong include the Australian King Parrot, Crimson Rosella, Eastern Sea Eagle and the Brown Gerygone. Sport Sporting teams have been a prominent part of Thirroul history and the \\"working class\\" people that established the village. Many of the existing sporting clubs having history dating back to the early settlement. Thirroul is represented in the Tooheys Illawarra Rugby League by the Thirroul Butchers. The Butchers were established in 1913. Star players include Ben Couchman, Brendon Smith, Aaron Beath and Fuad Suljkanovic. The Thirroul Butchers attract crowds between 500 and 1500 a game, depending on their opponents. Thirroul is also home to the Thirroul Junior Football Club (TJFC). The club consists of many male & female junior teams ranging from under 6's to under 18's, 4 senior women's sides and 3 senior men's. In 2002 the first senior women's football side was entered into the local IWSA competition, that team went on to finish third in their inaugural season. The first senior men's side, the Thunder, was established for the 2008 season. That same year the women's sides became affectionately known as: 'The Thunderbirds'. Currently Thirroul is the only club in the Illawarra to enter a women's team into each of the IWFA's 4 competitions: Premier / Reserve Grade, Division 1 and Over 30s. Football (soccer) is played at the southern end of the local Thomas Gibson Park and rugby league is held at the northern end which has a large grandstand. Thirroul is also part of the Northern Suburbs Netball Club. The Thirroul Amateur Swimming Club has been operating in Thirroul since 1954. Swim nights are conducted weekly between October and March. The club is non-profit and affiliated with NSW Swimming. Thirroul District Cricket Club was established in 1896. It is believed the original home ground was the current site of Slacky Flat, before games moved to Gibson Park in the early 1900s. In 1976/77, Woonona Cricket Club folded and merged with Thirroul Cricket Club. In the mid 1990s, the unenviable decision to relocate the club's home ground to Hollymount Park, Woonona was made and in 1996 the Senior division of the club underwent a name change from Thirroul Cricket Club to Northern Districts Cricket Club. Initially matches were played on the western turf pitch of Hollymount Park however in 2005 a new five (5) pitch turf wicket square was installed on the Eastern side of Hollymount Park and the Eastern clubhouse was redeveloped. The junior division of the club incorporates both names as Thirroul & Northern Districts Cricket Club. In popular culture Thirroul features in the musical piece Small Town by Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe. A note published by Faber Music states that forty years after the visit of D.H. Lawrence and his novel Kangaroo, \\"Peter Sculthorpe envisaged Thirroul as the quintessential Australian town, frozen in a more innocent time\\". The music evokes the architecture of the town, the township monument and includes a rendering of the Last Post evoking an Anzac Day ceremony at the town war memorial.

The name Associated Equipment Company was hardly ever used; instead it traded under the AEC and ACLO brands. History Inception The London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) was founded in 1855 to amalgamate and regulate the horse-drawn omnibus services then operating in London. The company began producing motor omnibuses for its own use in 1909 with the X-type designed by its chief motor engineer, Frank Searle, at works in Blackhorse Lane, Walthamstow. The X-type was followed by Searle's B-type design, considered to be one of the first mass- produced commercial vehicles. In 1912, LGOC was taken over by the Underground Group of companies, which at that time owned most of the London Underground, and extensive tram operations. As part of the reorganisation following the takeover, a separate concern was set up for the bus manufacturing elements, and was named Associated Equipment Company, better-known as AEC. AEC's first commercial vehicle was a lorry based on the X-type bus chassis. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, AEC's ability to produce large numbers of vehicles using assembly line methods became important in supplying the increasing need for army lorries. AEC began large-scale production of the 3-ton Y-type lorry, commenced in 1916, and continued beyond the end of the war. From then on, AEC became associated with both lorries and buses. Interwar years A 1921 AEC S-type Bus at the Heritage Motor Centre In 1926, AEC and Daimler formed the Associated Daimler Company, which was dissolved two years later. In 1927, AEC moved its manufacturing from Walthamstow to a new plant at Southall. G. J. Rackham was appointed Chief Engineer and Designer in 1928. He had previously worked for Leyland Motors. His ideas contributed significantly to AEC's reputation for quality and reliability. From 1929, AEC produced new models: the names of lorries began with \\"M\\" (Majestic, Mammoth, Mercury, and so on), and those of buses began with \\"R\\" (Regent, Regal, Renown, and so on). These original \\"M-models\\" continued in production until the end of World War II. AEC introduced diesel engines across the range in the mid-1930s. From 1931 to 1938, AEC and English Electric co-produced trolleybuses. AEC supplied the chassis, and English Electric the electric motors and control equipment. In 1932, AEC took a controlling interest in the British subsidiary of the American Four Wheel Drive (FWD) company, and began to use more standard AEC components in those vehicles. To avoid confusion, these were marketed under the name Hardy. Production ceased about 1936. World War II AEC Matador artillery tractor Non-military production stopped in 1941, from then until 1944 AEC produced nearly 10,000 vehicles for the war effort. During the war, AEC produced their 10-ton 4x4 Matador artillery tractor (an adaptation of their commercial 4x2 Matador lorry that exploited AEC's experience with the Hardy FWD venture). A 6x6 version was designated as the AEC Marshall but almost always called the Matador. To this they added the AEC Armoured Car in 1941. Other uses of the Matador chassis were the Deacon self-propelled anti-tank gun vehicle, used briefly in North Africa; and the AEC Armoured Command Vehicle, popularly known as the Dorchester. Post war A 1957 AEC Regent V A 1961 AEC Routemaster AEC bus in Malta In 1946 AEC and Leyland Motors formed British United Traction as a joint venture to manufacture trolleybuses and traction equipment for diesel railcars since reduced demand would not require the existing capacity of both parents. In 1946 AEC resumed civilian production with the 0661/20 Regent II and the 0662/20 Regal I. These were not new models but a recommencement of the most basic AEC 1939 specification bus models. The single-decker was going to be marketed as Regal II until somebody at Southall remembered the 1936-8 lightweight 0862 model of that name and as a result the name was corrected after the launch publicity had been printed. At the end of 1946 the postwar 0961 RT was in build and by 1948 Mammoth Major, Matador and Monarch Mk IIIs were in production, followed by the 'provincial' Regent III and the Regal III. Also in 1948 AEC acquired Crossley Motors and the Maudslay Motor Company and on 1 October 1948 AEC set up Associated Commercial Vehicles (ACV) as the holding company for the newly acquired businesses and its own manufacturing firm, which was renamed AEC Limited. The initials AEC remained on its vehicles, with the exception of some badge-engineered versions, such as the Crossley Regent bus. In 1949 ACV acquired the bus coachbuilding company Park Royal Vehicles, along with its subsidiary Charles H Roe. Park Royal designed a new cab for the AEC Mercury in the mid-1950s, which appeared on all models across the range about this time. In 1961 ACV acquired Thornycroft. The Thornycroft name disappeared from all the vehicles except the specialist airport crash tenders, such as the Nubian, and the Antar off-road tractor unit. Production of the AEC Dumptruk was transferred to Basingstoke, and the Thornycroft six-speed constant-mesh gearbox and later nine and ten-speed range-change versions were fitted to AEC, Albion and Leyland buses and lorries. The AEC engines were used in Finnish Vanaja lorries and buses in the 1960s. Leyland takeover Leyland Motors acquired ACV in 1962. AEC lorries were given the same \\"Ergomatic\\" cabs used across several Leyland marques (including Albion). In 1968, all AEC double-decker buses ceased production with the completion of the last Routemasters, and its last buses, motorcoaches and lorries were built in 1979. The AEC name actually disappeared from commercial vehicles in 1977, but the Leyland Marathon was built at the Southall plant until British Leyland closed it in 1979.AEC plant closes as Marathon moves Commercial Motor 17 November 1978Southall's last TL12 Marathon Commercial Motor 20 April 1979 In 1979, the production of Leyland (AEC) vehicles was transferred to remaining Leyland Truck and Bus plants. Foreign operations ACLO ACLO (supposed to be the acronym of Associated Company Lorries and Omnibuses) was the brand name used by AEC in Latin American countries, including Brazil, and in Spain (except Portugal) to sell all their products. It seems that there was no clear reason for this badge engineering operation, although a formal request from the German AEG industrial group, which was very active in the Spanish-speaking countries, has been suggested. This is quite likely as the AEC 422 NS type exported to BVOAG Berlin was also badged ACLO. ACLOs were specially pervasive in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. Particularly in Uruguay, there were two ACLO fleets. They were interesting buses, quite faster than Leyland Tiger in use by other fleets. It was said at the time (early '60s) that the main reason was inter-urban gearing instead of purely urban gearing present in Leylands. An interesting feature was preselector gear-change, similar to those in Leyland buses, commanded by a smallish gated lever installed by the steering wheel, with a reversed gate, with first gear to the right and up, and fourth gear to the bottom and left. In Spain, ACLOs could be seen mainly as double-deck buses in Barcelona, and as line coaches in ALSA fleet. UTIC-AEC In Portugal, the AEC vehicles, mainly coaches and buses but also lorries, were assembled and bodied by UTIC, a large coachbuilding firm based in Lisbon, and marketed under the UTIC-AEC badge, for many years. From 1971-73 the Loughborough based dealer Moseley imported nine UTIC U2043 coaches which were marketed as the Moseley Continental Tagus. They were mechanically equivalent to a rear-engined Reliance or a coach version of the Swift 691 which AEC had planned but never marketed. They were expensive to buy new and the square sided styling looked dated to British eyes in the age of the Elite and Dominant coaches, thus they were slow selling. These were probably the only right hand drive coaches built by UTIC. At the time Moseley also marketed Salvador Caetano Coaches under its own name. Barreiros AEC In the late 1950s, Spanish government restrictions on imports reduced AEC sales in Spain to virtually nil. As a consequence, AEC approached a Spanish truck manufacturer, Barreiros Diesel, to jointly produce buses and coaches based on AEC designs. The venture started in 1961, used Barreiros AEC as brand name, disregarding ACLO, and seemed very promising; production of the AEC off-road dump trucks being planned too. Nevertheless, the Leyland takeover in 1962 soon undermined the agreement, as Leyland was partnering with Barreiros's Spanish arch-rival, Pegaso; and eventually Barreiros looked for another collaborator in the bus arena, signing in 1967 an agreement with Belgian company Van Hool. Vehicles A preserved AEC Renown, previously run by King Alfred Motor Services. Buses Lorries and other commercial vehicles ;Y Type AEC's first purpose-built commercial vehicle, the Y Type was introduced in 1915. The improved YA Type appeared in 1917. More than ten thousand of these vehicles were supplied to the War Department by 1919. Many of these were acquired by civilian operators following the war. YB and YC Types continued in production until 1921. ;Model 201 ;Model 428 ;Model 501 & 506 ;Model 701 ;Roadtrain The AEC Roadtrain was an experimental early 1930s road train. ;Majestic There were three distinct incarnations of the AEC Majestic: * Majestic, model 666 (built 1930-36) - 6 ton normal-control lorry. * Majestic, models 3521/3531 (1950‚Äì57) - 10-ton twin-steer (\\"Chinese six\\") 6x2 cabover. * Majestic, model GB6 (1959‚Äì68), - 6x4 variant of heavy normal-control Mogul, built primarily for export and specialist uses. Mammoth Major Tanker ;Mammoth The AEC Mammoth was introduced in 1930, being largest truck in the AEC range and the first to be available as a cabover. It was originally a 7/8 ton 4x2 lorry with a six-cylinder overhead valve engine developing on a wheelbase of 16 ft 7 in. A 6x4 variant was the \\"Mammoth Major\\". From 1934 a distinction was made between the lighter Mammoth Minor, and the heavier Mammoth Major 6 (6x4) and Mammoth Major 8 (8x2 or 8x4), which appeared in 1934. The Mammoth Major Mk II was introduced in 1935; the eight-wheeler could carry 15-ton loads. It remained in production until 1948 when it was superseded by the Mk III, which was mechanically similar, but had the Park Royal cab. Subsequent Mammoth Majors featured the Mk V cab, and finally the tilting Ergomatic cab. The original 4x2 Mammoth and lightweight Mammoth Minor were relatively short-lived models, but both names were later re-used. * Mammoth, model 667 (1930‚Äì34) - 4x2 cabover * Mammoth Major 6 Mk.I/II, models 668 (1930‚Äì35), 366/O366 (1935‚Äì48) - 6x4 cabover (Mk.II from 1934) * Mammoth Major 6 Mk.III, models 3671/3672/3673 (1948‚Äì60) - 6x4 cabover ('tin front' cab from 1955) * Mammoth Major 6 Mk.V, models G6 (1959‚Äì66) - 6x4 cabover * Mammoth Major 6, model TG6R (1965‚Äì78) - 6x4 cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab) * Mammoth Major 8 Mk.II, models 680 (1934‚Äì35), 386/O386 (1935‚Äì48) - 8x4 cabover * Mammoth Major 8 Mk.III, models 3871/3872/3873/3881/3882 (1948‚Äì61)- 8x4 cabover ('tin front' cab from 1955) * Mammoth Major 8 Mk.V, model G8 (1959‚Äì66) - 8x4 cabover, * Mammoth Major 8, model TG8R (1966‚Äì78) - 8x4 cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab) * Mammoth Minor, model 366L (1936‚Äì41) - lightweight 6x2 cabover * Mammoth Minor, model TG6RF (1965‚Äì67) - twin-steer (\\"Chinese six\\") 6x2 cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab) Normal control variants of the Mammoth family were also available, although much less common that the cabovers: * Mammoth Major 6 Mk.I/II, model 266 (1930‚Äì36) and 366 (1936‚Äì48) - 6x2 normal control * Mammoth Major 6 Mk.III, models 2671 (1948‚Äì60) and 2621/2631 (1956‚Äì62) - 6x4 normal control * Mammoth Mk.III, model 2421/2431 (1956‚Äì62), 4x2 normal control AEC Mandator ;Mandator The AEC Mandator name was originally used for medium-duty models in the 1930s, but in 1949 the Matador 4x2 was renamed Mandator. The name was used for the heavier AEC 4x2s until the end of production in the 1970s, and was especially popular as a tractor unit. * Mandator, model 669 (1931‚Äì35) - medium-duty 4x2 cabover * Mandator, model 672 (1931‚Äì32) - medium-duty 4x2 normal control * Mandator Mk.III, models 3472/3474/3475 (1949‚Äì55) - 4x2 cabover.

A few were given AEC badges to satisfy individual customer preferences. The Marathon name had formerly been used on a Maudslay bus chassis. ;Marshal Pre-war 6x4 3ton military lorry built with various body styles- some were employed by the Royal Air Force as cranes (using the Coles Crane). The name was reintroduced for 6x2 and 6x4 medium-duty lorries from the 1960s-1970s. * Marshal, model 644 (1932/35-41) - 6x4 military truck. Prototypes (1932) included both normal- control and cabover versions, but all production vehicles were cabovers. * Marshal, model GM6 (1961‚Äì66) - 6x2 or 6x4 medium-duty cabover (Mk.V cab) * Marshal, model TGM6 (1965‚Äì77) - 6x2 or 6x4 medium-duty cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab). Variant with larger (but downrated) engine was known as Marshal Major, model 2TGM6 * Marshal 8, model TGM8 (1967‚Äì68) 8x4 medium duty cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab) See also: Matador ;Matador The original AEC Matador five-ton 4x2 commercial lorry was introduced in 1932, but the name was most famously used for the 4x4 artillery tractor version introduced in 1938. These vehicles exploited AEC's experience with four-wheel drive that it had gained from its involvement in the British Four Wheel Drive vehicles marketed under the name Hardy. AEC produced 9,620 artillery tractors; 514 6x6 bowsers for the Royal Air Force; 192 6x6 lorries (some of which had Coles Cranes mounted); and 185 similar vehicles, but 6x4, for mobile oxygen plants. They were known by the nickname \\"Mat\\". New civilian Matadors appeared after the war, and many ex- military Matadors were adapted for post-war commercial use, especially as timber lorries and recovery vehicles. There was a final short run of the 0853 4x4 Matador for the Army in the early fifties, due to ongoing issues with the introduction of the replacement Leyland. The last Matador was a 4x4 variant of the Mercury, introduced in 1960. * Matador Mk.I, model 645 (1932‚Äì35) - 4x2 cabover version of Mercury * Matador Mk.II, model 346/O346 (1935‚Äì47) - 4x2 cabover. Model 236/O246 (1935‚Äì40) was the normal-control version * Matador Mk.II/III, model 853/O853 (1938‚Äì59) - 4x4 cabover (Mk.III from 1947) * Matador Mk.III, model 3471 (1947‚Äì49) - 4x2 cabover. Renamed Mandator in 1949 * Matador, model 4GM4 (1960‚Äì65) - 4x4 cabover (Mk.V cab, but marketed as \\"Matador Mk.II\\") The Matador name is often used for the 10-ton 6x6 military vehicles of Model 854/O854 (built 1940-44), but this model was never given an official name. It was an extended Matador chassis, mated to a Marshal double- drive bogie. A 1970 AEC Mercury A 1962-AEC Mercury ;Mercury The AEC Mercury (Model 440) was first built in 1928. This was a forward-control lorry with a wheelbase of for 4 ton payloads. The Model 640 was introduced in 1930, with a four-cylinder petrol engine developing 65 bhp. The name was resurrected for medium-duty 4x2 lorries and tractors built from the 1950s to the 1970s. * Mercury, model 640 (1928‚Äì37) - 4x2 normal control * Mercury, model G4M (1953‚Äì65) - 4x2 medium-duty cabover. The Mk.I (1953‚Äì55) usually had a Duramin cab, whereas the Mk.II (1955‚Äì65) usually had Park Royal cabs ('tin front' and later Mk.V cabs). Other cab manufacturers included Bowyers. * Mercury, model TGM4 (1964‚Äì77) - 4x2 medium duty cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab). In some export markets (notably New Zealand) this model was sold as a Monarch ;Militant The AEC Militant - or \\"Milly\\" - was the 1952 replacement for the Matador; a 6x4 or 6x6 artillery tractor/military lorry which continued in various forms until the 1970s. The Militant name had earlier been used by Maudslay in the 1930s. * Militant Mk.I, models O859 and O860 (1952‚Äì66) - 6x4 and 6x6 cabover * Militant Mk.II (1962, prototypes only) - 6x6 cabover (Park Royal Mk.V type cab) * Militant Mk.III models O870 and O880 (1966‚Äì79) - 6x6 cabover. These were the last vehicles to use a variant of the AEC/Park Royal cab. ;Mogul The AEC Mogul model GM4 (1959‚Äì67) was a normal-control 4x2 built primarily for export markets. The Mogul name had originally been used on Maudslay lorries. ;Monarch The original AEC Monarch was built from 1931 to 1939 at AEC's Southall works. The first version had payload of 7 tons (increased to tons from 1933) and was fitted with either an four-cylinder 5.1-litre diesel engine or an 80 hp four-cylinder 5.1-litre petrol engine. This was a robust and well-designed lorry, popular with both drivers and operators. The model was discontinued in the 1950s, although the name lived on into the 1970s in some export markets. 16px TL 3513 (1934) KYE 402 (1949) * Monarch Mk.I, models 641 (1930‚Äì33) and 647/648 (1933‚Äì35) - 4x2 cabover * Monarch Mk.II, models 344/346/O346 (1935‚Äì47) - 4x2 cabover. There was also a normal-control version, model 244 (1935‚Äì40) * Monarch Mk.III, models O345/3451 (1947‚Äì56) - 4x2 cabover * Monarch, model TGM4 (see Mercury TGM4) ;Mustang The AEC Mustang model GM6 (1956‚Äì61) was a medium-weight, twin-steer (\\"Chinese six\\") 6x2 cabover, derived from the Mercury ;Dump Trucks From 1957 to 1971 AEC built a series of large off-road dump trucks: * Model 3673M (1957‚Äì63) - 6x4 half-cab derived from Mammoth Major, with 10 cubic yard dump dumper capacity * Model HDK4 (1959‚Äì65) - 4x4 normal-control with 18 cu/yd capacity * Model DK6 (1961‚Äì62) - 6x4 or 6x6 semi-cabover derived from Militant, 10 cu/yd capacity. * Model BDK6 (1964‚Äì71) - normal-control 6-wheeler, 10 cu/yd capacity.

By far the biggest was hosted by The AEC Society, and was held over the weekend of 26 and 27 May 2012 at Newark Showground in Nottinghamshire. It was the biggest ever gathering of AEC's, and over 225 AEC vehicles attended as well as over 350 vehicles of other marques. It was the biggest rally ever held by The AEC Society and as well as glorious weather all weekend, was closed by a BBMF flypast.

It is the fourth constitution adopted by the Vietnamese government since the political reunification of the country in 1976. Current constitution The current constitution, known as the 2013 Constitution, contains a preamble and 11 chapters: *Chapter I: Political System *Chapter II: Human Rights, Basic Civil Rights and Civic Duties *Chapter III: The Economy, Society, Culture, Education, Science, Technology, and the Environment *Chapter IV: Defence of the Homeland *Chapter V: The National Assembly *Chapter VI: President of the Republic *Chapter VII: The Government *Chapter VIII: The People's Court and the People's Procuracy *Chapter IX: Local Government *Chapter X: The National Electoral Council and the State Audit Office *Chapter XI: The Effect of the Constitution and Amending the Constitution Previous constitutions The Democratic Republic of Vietnam had two constitutions: *1946 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, adopted on November 9, 1946 *1959 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, adopted on December 31, 1959 Upon political reunification of the country in 1976, the 1960 Constitution of the Democratic Republic became the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Since then, the Vietnamese government has adopted two constitutions before the 2013 Constitution *1980 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, adopted on December 19, 1980 *1992 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, adopted on April 25, 1992 and amended in 2001. The former Republic of Vietnam also had two constitutions, adopted in 1956 and 1967. Neither of these constitutional documents is in force, as the 1967 Constitution was abrogated when the government of the Republic of Vietnam collapsed in 1975. 1946 Constitution The 1946 constitution was crafted with the intent of making the DRV become a people's democratic regime. Accordingly, it provided freedom of speech, organization, press. The document remained in effect in Viet Minh- controlled areas throughout the First Indochina War and in North Vietnam following partition in 1954, until it was replaced with a new constitution in 1959. 1959 Constitution While the 1946 constitution was a superficially liberal democratic document, its 1959 successor was a fully Communist document. Its preamble defined the DRV as a \\"people's democratic state led by the working class,\\" thus codifying the actual state of affairs that had prevailed since 1945. The document provided for a nominal separation of powers among legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. On paper, the legislative function was carried out by the National Assembly. The assembly was empowered to make laws and to elect the chief officials of the state, such as the president (who was largely a symbolic head of state), the vice president, and cabinet ministers. Together those elected (including the president and vice president) formed a Council of Ministers, which constitutionally (but not in practice) was subject to supervision by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. Headed by a prime minister, the council was the highest executive organ of state authority. Besides overseeing the Council of Ministers, the assembly's Standing Committee also supervised on paper the Supreme People's Court, the chief organ of the judiciary. The assembly's executive side nominally decided on national economic plans, approved state budgets, and acted on questions of war or peace. In reality, however, final authority on all matters rested with the Political Bureau. 1980 Constitution The reunification of North and South Vietnam (the former Republic of Vietnam) in 1976 provided the primary motivation for revising the 1959 constitution. Revisions were made along the ideological lines set forth at the Fourth National Congress of the VCP in 1976, emphasizing popular sovereignty and promising success in undertaking \\"revolutions\\" in production, science and technology, culture, and ideology. In keeping with the underlying theme of a new beginning associated with reunification, the constitution also stressed the need to develop a new political system, a new economy, a new culture, and a new socialist person. The 1959 document had been adopted during the tenure of Ho Chi Minh and demonstrated a certain independence from the Soviet model of state organization. The 1980 Constitution was drafted when Vietnam faced a serious threat from China, and political and economic dependence on the Soviet Union had increased. Perhaps, as a result, the completed document resembles the 1977 Soviet Constitution. The 1980 Vietnamese Constitution concentrates power in a newly established Council of State much like the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, endowing it nominally with both legislative and executive powers. Many functions of the legislature remain the same as under the 1959 document, but others have been transferred to the executive branch or assigned to both branches concurrently. The executive branch appears strengthened overall, having gained a second major executive body, the Council of State, and the importance of the National Assembly appears to have been reduced accordingly. The role of the Council of Ministers, while appearing on paper to have been subordinated to the new Council of State, in practice retained its former primacy. Among the innovative features of the 1980 document is the concept of \\"collective mastery\\" of society, a frequently used expression attributed to the late party secretary, Le Duan (1908- 1986). The concept is a Vietnamese version of popular sovereignty that advocates an active role for the people so that they may become their own masters as well as masters of society, nature, and the nation. It states that the people's collective mastery in all fields is assured by the state and is implemented by permitting the participation in state affairs of mass organizations. On paper, these organizations, to which almost all citizens belong, play an active role in government and have the right to introduce bills before the National Assembly. Another feature is the concept of socialist legality, which dictates that \\"the state manage society according to law and constantly strengthen the socialist legal system.\\" The concept, originally introduced at the Third National Party Congress in 1960, calls for achieving socialist legality through the state, its organizations, and its people. Law, in effect, is made subject to the decisions and directives of the party. The 1980 Constitution comprises 147 articles in 12 chapters dealing with numerous subjects, including the basic rights and duties of citizens. Article 67 guarantees the citizens' rights to freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and association, and the freedom to demonstrate. These rights, however, were subject to a caveat stating that \\"no one may misuse democratic freedoms to violate the interests of the state and the people.\\" In practice, the party and the government had considerable latitude to determine what was in \\"the interests of the state and the people.\\" References  Further reading   General reading and the 1992 Constitution and 2001 amendments  *Mark Sidel, The Constitution of Vietnam: A Contextual Analysis, Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2009. *Mark Sidel, Law and Society in Vietnam, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008. *To Van-Hoa, Judicial Independence, Lund: Jurisf√∂rlaget i Lund, 2006. *Mark Sidel, Analytical Models for Understanding Constitutions and Constitutional Dialogue in Socialist Transitional States: Re-Interpreting Constitutional Dialogue in Vietnam, 6 Singapore Journal of International and Comparative Law 42-89 (2002). *Pip Nicholson, Vietnamese Legal Institutions in Comparative Perspective: Constitutions and Courts Considered, in K Jayasuriya (ed.), Law, Capitalism and Power in Asia: The Rule of Law and Legal Institutions, London: Routledge, 1999. *Russell H K Heng, The 1992 Revised Constitution of Vietnam: Background and Scope of Changes, 4:3 Contemporary Southeast Asia 221 (1992).

They were first observed in Crookes tubes during experiments by the German scientist Eugen Goldstein, in 1886. Later work on anode rays by Wilhelm Wien and J. J. Thomson led to the development of mass spectrometry. Anode ray tube Simplified representation of an anode ray tube, showing the rays to the right of the perforated cathode 210x210px Goldstein used a gas- discharge tube which had a perforated cathode. When an electrical potential of several thousand volts is applied between the cathode and anode, faint luminous \\"rays\\" are seen extending from the holes in the back of the cathode. These rays are beams of particles moving in a direction opposite to the \\"cathode rays\\", which are streams of electrons which move toward the anode. Goldstein called these positive rays Kanalstrahlen, \\"channel rays\\" or \\"canal rays\\", because they were produced by the holes or channels in the cathode. The process by which anode rays are formed in a gas-discharge anode ray tube is as follows. When the high voltage is applied to the tube, its electric field accelerates the small number of ions (electrically charged atoms) always present in the gas, created by natural processes such as radioactivity. These collide with atoms of the gas, knocking electrons off of them and creating more positive ions. These ions and electrons in turn strike more atoms, creating more positive ions in a chain reaction. The positive ions are all attracted to the negative cathode, and some pass through the holes in the cathode. These are the anode rays. By the time they reach the cathode, the ions have been accelerated to a sufficient speed such that when they collide with other atoms or molecules in the gas they excite the species to a higher energy level. In returning to their former energy levels these atoms or molecules release the energy that they had gained. That energy gets emitted as light. This light-producing process, called fluorescence, causes a glow in the region where the ions emerge from the cathode. Anode ray ion source An anode ray ion source typically is an anode coated with the halide salt of an alkali or alkaline earth metal. Application of a sufficiently high electrical potential creates alkali or alkaline earth ions and their emission is most brightly visible at the anode.

Under the Polish People's Republic, it was one of the most advertised construction sites and a principal venue for Party and state festivities. In the 1980s the stadium became dilapidated, as no funds could be found to refurbish it. After 1989 it was used mainly as a bazaar called Jarmark Europa, becoming famous as the place to buy a whole range of goods, most notably clothes, software, hardware and media. Its demolition began in September 2008, and the new National Stadium was constructed in its place to serve as one of the venues for Euro 2012. History In 1953 the Association of Polish Architects held an open contest for the project of an \\"Olympic Stadium for the city of Warsaw\\". It was won by the team led by Jerzy Hryniewiecki, Zbigniew Ihnatowicz, and Jerzy So≈Çtan and later the same year the construction was started. The stadium was constructed mostly with rubble from buildings destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. The project involved the construction of an open air oval-shaped Olympic stadium: it contains a football pitch and a 400-metre racing track. Theoretically the terraces with wooden benches provided seats for 71,008 people, but during the biggest festivals organised there it accommodated more than 100,000 spectators. In addition, the stadium was equipped with a practice field, a small sports dome, 900 parking spaces and was surrounded by a park. The stadium was also connected to a nearby bus station and a railway station opened specifically for the transport of spectators. Soon after its opening, it became Poland's national stadium. It housed most important international football matches and athletics competitions, as well as communist party galas, concerts, and commemorative festivals. In addition, it served as the final lap of the Peace Race. In 1968, it was the site of Ryszard Siwiec's self- immolation in protest at the invasion of Czechoslovakia during a propaganda festival. In 1983, due to technical problems, the stadium was abandoned. In 1989 it was rented by the City of Warsaw to a company that turned the stadium into an outdoor market known as Jarmark Europa, which soon became Europe's largest open-air market. With over 5000 traders (and many more unregistered; a large number of traders were from other countries) it was the biggest facility of its kind in Poland. Official figures state an annual turnover of 500 million zloty, which is generally believed to be an underestimate. The top tier of the market was full of vendors of such items as clothing, souvenirs, and bootlegged CDs and movies. Police say the market was the main selling point for black market goods in the country. Between 1995 and 2001 more than 25,000 traders were prosecuted, while approximately 10 million infringing CDs and video tapes were confiscated. It is commonly believed that this was the tip of the iceberg. Amongst the English-speaking community in Warsaw the stadium was often referred to as the \\"Russian market\\". The black market aspect of the stadium, with all its shady dealings, illegal products, and in particular the weapons, has made it into mainstream media of which one example is the suspense novel by Jack King: The Fifth Internationale. New National Stadium Clearing the ground for the construction of the new National Stadium The old stadium was demolished to prepare for the construction of the new National Stadium accommodating 55,000 spectators. Construction on the stadium was finished in 2011, and was one of the stadiums hosting the Euro 2012. Adjoining the new stadium there are to be erected the following structures: a 15,000-seat indoor arena, a new railway station \\"Warszawa Stadion\\", a modern hotel, a covered Olympic swimming pool with seats for 4,000 spectators, a meeting hall and a metro station \\"Stadion\\" on a yet-to-be built subway line. During the European Championship itself the following matches are to be played at the stadium: the opening match, group matches, a quarterfinal and a semifinal. Stadion Dziesiƒôciolecia and its grounds are the property of the Government of Poland, and the City of Warsaw has declared that for this reason it would be illegal for the city to financially participate in the project, which is to be financed by the national government. The building of the National Stadium was delayed by disputes with vendors who protested against orders to leave the 10th-Anniversary Stadium.

It was also, for a short period between 1909 and 1912, a motor bus manufacturer.  Overview  A LGOC motor bus c1903. The London General Omnibus Company was founded in 1855 to amalgamate and regulate the many independent horse-drawn omnibus services then operating in London. Originally an Anglo-French enterprise, also known as the Compagnie Generale des Omnibus de Londres, the LGOC soon became the largest omnibus operator in London. It bought out hundreds of independently owned buses and established a consistent level of service for its fleet. Within a year, the LGOC controlled 600 of London's 810 omnibuses. Under its chairman Sir John Pound, in 1902 it looked at an option to purchase a competitor, the Star Omnibus Company, but it was unable to complete negotiations. LGOC began using motor omnibuses in 1902, and the last LGOC horse-drawn bus ran on 25 October 1911. In 1908 the LGOC bought the Road Car Company, the Vanguard Company, and its other main rivals, thereby gaining a virtual monopoly in London. The merger of these three companies (the Road Car Company was also known as Union Jack owing to its habit of flying the British flag on its vehicles) gave the new and enlarged LGOC the most experienced operating and engineering personnel of any operator - and perhaps manufacturer - in the country at the time. The LGOC absorbed the Great Eastern London Motor Omnibus Company (previously known as London Motor Omnibus Company) in March 1911. In 1912, the Underground Group, which owned most of the London Underground, bought the LGOC. This followed the start of negotiations between the two companies in 1910 that finally led to the publication of an official statement regarding the proposed terms of the merger on 19 January 1912.Croome & Jackson, Rails through the Clay, London, 1962, p149 By early February 1912 the majority of shareholders in the LGOC had accepted the terms. op cit, p149 This in time allowed increasing co-ordination between LGOC bus and tube services, with integrated fares, such as was seen with the opening of the bus station adjacent to Hammersmith station in April 1914. Croome & Jackson, Rails through the Clay, London, 1962, p149 In 1933, the LGOC, along with the rest of the Underground Group, became part of the new London Passenger Transport Board. The name London General fell into disuse, and London Transport instead became synonymous with the red London bus.  Manufacturing  LGOC began producing motor omnibuses for its own use in 1909 at works established in premises inherited from Vanguard at Blackhorse Lane, Walthamstow, London. The first model built was the LGOC X-type, which was designed by Frank Searle, LGOC's chief engineer. The X-type was followed by the LGOC B-type, from the same designer.Thackray, Brian (2004). AEC Vehicles: Origins to 1929. Venture Publications Ltd. After the Underground Group's acquisition of the LGOC in 1912, the bus manufacturing elements of the LGOC were split out to create the Associated Equipment Company (AEC). Rebirth of the name In the privatisation of London bus services in the 1980s, London Transport created a series of shadow bus operating companies with names of geographic or historic significance, and one of these was christened London General in honour of the LGOC. The new London General was initially privatised by management buy-out, and acquired by the Go-Ahead Group in 1996. Popular culture The London General Omnibus Company was featured in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Isambard Kingdom Brunel, played by actor Kenneth Branagh, was depicted arriving in a green horse-drawn London General Omnibus Company Limited bus at the start of the ceremony. In the video game Assassin's Creed Syndicate published by Ubisoft in 2015, assassins come to the aid of Edward Hodson Bayley and company, who was said to be responsible for the founding of the united London General Omnibus Company in the storyline campaign, supplying omnibuses for the city.

During World War II, he served in the Waffen- SS, the combat branch of the SS, and commanded several SS divisions and corps. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. Together with Paul Hausser, he contributed significantly to the development and transformation of the Waffen-SS into a combat force made up of volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and un-occupied lands. Steiner was chosen by Heinrich Himmler to oversee the creation of and then command the SS Division Wiking. In 1943, he was promoted to the command of the III SS Panzer Corps. On 28 January 1945, Steiner was placed in command of the 11th SS Panzer Army, which formed part of a new Army Group Vistula, an ad-hoc formation to defend Berlin from the Soviet armies advancing from the Vistula River. On 21 April 1945, during the Battle for Berlin, Steiner was placed in command of Army Detachment Steiner, while Adolf Hitler ordered Steiner to envelop the 1st Belorussian Front through a pincer movement, advancing from the north of the city. However, as his unit was outnumbered by ten to one, Steiner made it clear that he did not have the capacity for a counter-attack on 22 April during the daily situation conference in the F√ºhrerbunker. After the capitulation of Germany, Steiner was imprisoned and investigated for war crimes. He faced charges at the Nuremberg Trials, but they were dropped and he was released in 1948. Along with other former high-ranking Waffen-SS personnel, Steiner was a founding member of HIAG, a lobby group of negationistic apologists formed in 1951 to campaign for the legal, economic and historical rehabilitation of the Waffen-SS. He died in 1966. World War I Born in 1896, Felix Steiner joined the Royal Prussian Army as an infantry cadet. During World War I, he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd class. In 1919, Steiner joined the paramilitary Freikorps in the East Prussian city of Memel and was incorporated into the Reichswehr in 1921. In 1933, he left the army having attained the rank of major. SS career Steiner first joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) (membership number: 4,264,295) and the Sturmabteilung (SA). In 1935 he enlisted in the SS. He took command of a battalion of SS- Verf√ºgungstruppen (SS-VT) troops, and within a year had been promoted to SS- Standartenf√ºhrer; and later was put in command of the SS-Deutschland Regiment. At the outbreak of World War II, he was SS-Oberf√ºhrer (Senior leader) in charge of the Waffen-SS regiment SS-Deutschland. He led this regiment through the Invasion of Poland and the Battle of France, for which he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 15 August 1940. Steiner was introduced to Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, to oversee the creation of, and then command the new SS Division Wiking. At the time of its creation, it consisted mostly of non-German volunteers (Dutch, Flemish, Finns and Scandinavians), including the Danish regiment Frikorps Danmark. Steiner was an outstanding soldier, an aggressive commander, of considerable personal courage, a born leader with a shrewd knowledge of panzer warfare: \\"Gruppenfuhrer Steiner moved quickly and fearlessly behind the tanks, in his light-coloured dust jacket and with his small battle staff. His command post was up front. Decisions and orders were adjusted to the progress of the fighting - rapidly with no time lapse. The artillery went into position; the forward observers registered and corrected the guns.\\"E. Klapdor, Viking Panzers, p.30. In April 1943, he was placed in command of a newly formed III SS Panzer Corps. The unit participated in anti-partisan actions in Yugoslavia. In November/December 1943 his corps was transferred to the Eastern Front and positioned in the northern sector at Leningrad under Army Group North. Steiner's Panzer Corps played a leading role during the Battle of Narva and the Battle of Tannenberg Line. His unit then withdrew with the rest of Army Group North to the Courland Peninsula. Battle of Berlin In January 1945, Steiner along with the III SS Panzer Corps was transferred by ship from the Courland Pocket to help with the defence of the German homeland. The corps was assigned to Army Group Vistula under the new Eleventh SS Panzer Army, although this army really only existed on paper. Once the Soviet Army reached the Oder river, the Eleventh SS Panzer Army became inactive and the III SS Panzer Corps was reassigned to the German Third Panzer Army as a reserve during the Soviets' Berlin Offensive Operation. During the Battle of Seelow Heights, the first major battle of the offensive, General Gotthard Heinrici, the commander of Army Group Vistula, transferred most of the III SS Panzer Corps' divisions to General Theodor Busse's Ninth Army. By 21 April, Soviet Marshal Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the German lines on the Seelow Heights. Hitler, ignoring the facts, started to call the ragtag units that came under Steiner's command Army Detachment Steiner (Armeeabteilung Steiner). An army detachment was something more than a corps but less than an army. Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the huge salient created by the 1st Belorussian Front's breakout. Steiner's attack was due to coincide with General Busse's Ninth Army, attacking from the south in a pincer attack. The Ninth Army had been pushed to south of the 1st Belorussian Front's salient. To facilitate this attack, Steiner was assigned the three divisions of the Ninth Army's CI Army Corps: the 4th SS Panzergrenadier Division Polizei, the 5th J√§ger Division, and the 25th Panzergrenadier Division. All three divisions were north of the Finow Canal on the Northern flank of Zhukov's salient. Weidling's LVI Panzer Corps, which was still east of Berlin with its northern flank just below Werneuchen, was also ordered to participate in the attack. The three divisions from CI Army Corps planned to attack south from Eberswalde on the Finow Canal towards the LVI Panzer Corps. The three divisions from CI Army Corps were 24 kilometres (about 15 miles) east of Berlin and the attack to the south would cut the 1st Belorussian Front's salient in two. Steiner called Heinrici and informed him that the plan could not be implemented because the 5th J√§ger Division and the 25th Panzergrenadier Division were deployed defensively and could not be redeployed until the 2nd Naval Division arrived from the coast to relieve them. This left only two battalions of the 4th SS Panzergrenadier Division available and they had no combat weapons. Based on Steiner's assessment, Heinrici called Hans Krebs, Chief of Staff of the German General Staff of the Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres or OKH), and told him that the plan could not be implemented. Heinrici asked to speak to Hitler, but was told Hitler was too busy to take his call. On 22 April 1945, at his afternoon conference, Hitler became aware that Steiner was not going to attack and he fell into a tearful rage. Hitler declared the war was lost, he blamed the generals and announced that he would stay on in Berlin until the end, then kill himself. On the same day, General Rudolf Holste was given what few mobile forces Steiner commanded so that he could participate in a new plan to relieve Berlin. Holste was to attack from the north while General Walther Wenck attacked from the west and General Theodor Busse attacked from the south. These attacks amounted to little and, on 25 April, the Soviet forces attacking to the north and to the south of Berlin linked up to the west of the city. Post-war After the surrender, Steiner was incarcerated until 1948. He faced charges at the Nuremberg Trials, but they were dropped for lack of solid evidence and he was released. With Paul Hausser, Herbert Gille and Otto Kumm, Steiner became a founding member of HIAG, the lobby group founded by former high-ranking Waffen-SS officers in West Germany in 1951. From his home in West Germany he published Die Freiwilligen der Waffen-SS: Idee und Opfergang; English: \\"The Volunteers of Waffen-SS: Idea and Sacrifice\\" in 1958. Steiner's books and memoirs have been characterised by historian Charles Sydnor as one of the \\"most important works of apologist literature,\\" together with warfare analyses Grenadiere by Kurt Meyer and Waffen-SS in Action by Paul Hausser. These works demanded rehabilitation of the military branch of the NSDAP, with Steiner's works being important in stressing the theme of the purely military Waffen-SS. A second book was published in 1963 under the title Die Armee der Ge√§chteten (English: \\"The Army of the Outlaws\\") and was also tendentious. Steiner died on 12 May 1966, 11 days before his 70th birthday. He never married.

A 24-minute OVA was released in 2003 followed by a six- episode TV series, broadcast in Japan in 2006. A DVD collection containing the OVA and TV series was released in North America in 2010. The origin of this anime series is different from most other anime series' as it is based on an Internet hoax rather than a previously existing manga series. History Papillon Rose started out as a metafiction joke on what was claimed to be the website for a new anime project Lingerie Fighter Papillon Rose. The website posted pictures of characters (which were usually copied from scenes in Sailor Moon, with the artwork changed) and a lyrics to opening and ending theme songs. Demand grew due to people finding the page and assuming it was for an actual series. Subsequently, an episode guide for the (non-existent) first series and manga was also made available, as well as a set of CD-ROMs containing a 2-minute animated promotional clip, eight tracks (six BGM and two vocal songs), system voice clips for computers, a Papillon Rose mahjong game, and two screen savers. The CDs were only made available for Comiket, and were not distributed outside Japan. The project homepage was redesigned and fake manga illustrations and notes from the fictional author were added. Amateur voice actors and singers were also contacted online to provide sample character voice clips for a handful of the villains and heroines. A 25-episode ONA series was promised in 2001 along with the release of an animated teaser trailer. Nothing other than the trailers were ever released online or elsewhere. On January 2002, a second season concept was introduced, named Lingerie Soldier Papillon Rose R, aiming to be released as an artbook on Comiket. On April 2004, a movie finale concept was introduced as well, named Lingerie Soldier Papillon Rose G. Subsequently, all of the project websites were either taken down or replaced with a blank page with the former content removed. There is no evidence that any fan-submitted material was ever used for either the OVA episode or the TV series. In the fall of 2014, a blog was opened featuring new artwork for what claimed to be a new version of the Papillon Rose series, a rebuild of the original idea as a film trilogy. A new website was opened a few days afterwards, advertising a Papillon Rose booth in the 2015 Comiket. A new doujinshi artbook was released together with two pencil boards, featuring new artwork for the characters and a similar storyline to the original incarnation of the web series. Lingerie Soldier Papillon Rose OVA 2003 was released as a single 24-minute OVA episode, produced by Echigoya. This one-episode OVA was distributed on VHS and DVD formats by Pink company and Office F&O; in 2003. This OVA episode is included in the 2010 North American DVD release with the six-episode Papillon Rose: The New Season TV series. Papillon Rose: The New Season TV series (2006) A six-episode TV series titled Papillon Rose: The New Season was broadcast in Japan in 2006. The TV series images and dialog are toned down considerably from the 2003 OVA. The TV series covers a time beginning a year after the ending of the OVA events and introduces new characters. Plot Summary We find the girls in town going about their lives without any memories of their past exploits or ability to transform. Tsubomi is approached by Rama, the cat, whom, at first, she does not understand. But the Earth, specifically the Tokyo otaku district of Akiba, is under attack by a trio of powerful alien women along with their minions. The explosions around her restore her memories and she reassembles the rest of the Papillon team to defend the town. The Papillon team is reassembled and the enemies are won over by the team's magical-girl powers and their \\"charms\\". North American Releases In March 2010, Section23 Films announced plans to release the six-episode TV series and the OVA on DVD for North America on behalf of Maiden Japan. The collection was released on June 8, 2010, on a single DVD titled \\"Papillon Rose.\\" This title was the first licensed by Maiden Japan for release in North America. It is in the Japanese language with English subtitles. In January 2014 the six episodes of the TV series and the single OVA episode were posted on the Anime Network website for online streaming. Reception The North American DVD release was reviewed by Chris Beveridge on the popular media blog Mania.com and given an overall grade of B. He summarizes his review: > ‚Ä≥Papillon Rose serves up just the right kind of parody of the Sailor Moon > and magical girl world with this release.

It was assigned to the family Elephantidae (Abel, 1919), but has also been placed in the Stegodontidae (R. L. Carroll, 1988). Stegodonts were present from 11.6 million years ago (Mya) to the late Pleistocene, with unconfirmed records of localized survival until 4,100 years ago. Fossils are found in Asian and African strata dating from the late Miocene; during the Pleistocene, they lived across large parts of Asia and East and Central Africa, and in Wallacea as far east as Timor.PaleoBiology Database: Stegodon, basic info Philippine National Museum A review of 130 papers written about 180 different sites with proboscidean remains in southern China revealed Stegodon to have been more common than Asian elephants; the papers gave many recent radiocarbon dates, the youngest being 2,150 BCE (4,100 BP).H. Saegusa, \\"Comparisons of Stegodon and Elephantid Abundances in the Late Pleistocene of Southern China \\", The World of Elephants -- Second International Congress, (Rome, 2001), 345-349. However, Turvey et al. (2013) reported that one of the faunal assemblages including supposed fossils of Holocene Stegodon (from Gulin, Sichuan Province) is actually late Pleistocene in age; other supposed fossils of Holocene stegodonts were lost and their age cannot be verified. The authors concluded that the latest confirmed occurrences of Stegodon from China are from the late Pleistocene, and that its Holocene survival cannot be substantiated. Life-sized models of Stegodon Morphology Skeletal restoration of S. zdansky Size Stegodon was one of the largest proboscideans, along with more derived genera. S. zdansky is known from an old male (50-plus years old) from the Yellow River that is tall and would have weighed approximately in life. It had a humerus long, a femur long, and a pelvis wide. Dwarfism S. florensis insularis is an extinct subspecies of Stegodon endemic to the island of Flores, Indonesia, and an example of insular dwarfism. The direct ancestor of S. florensis insularis is the larger-bodied S. florensis florensis, from Early Pleistocene and early Middle Pleistocene sites on Flores.Van Den Bergh, G.D., Aweb, R.D., Morwoodc, M.J., Sutiknab, T., Jatmikob and Saptomo, E. W. 2008. The youngest stegodon remains in Southeast Asia from the Late Pleistocene archaeological site Liang Bua, Flores, Indonesia. Quaternary International 182(1): 16-48. Remains of S. florensis insularis are known from the cave of Liang Bua. Similar to modern-day elephants, stegodonts were likely good swimmers,Simpson, G. (1977). Too Many Lines; The Limits of the Oriental and Australian Zoogeographic Regions. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 121(2), 107-120. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/986523 as their fossils are frequently encountered on Asian islands (such as Sulawesi, Flores, Timor, Sumba in Indonesia; Luzon and Mindanao in the Philippines; Taiwan; and Japan), all locations not connected by land bridges with the Asian continent even during periods of low sea level (during the cold phases of the Pleistocene). A general evolutionary trend in large mammals on islands is island dwarfing. The smallest dwarf species known is S. sumbaensis from Sumba, with an estimated body mass of 250 kg. The slightly larger S. sondaari, known from Early Pleistocene layers on the Indonesian island of Flores, had an estimated body weight of between 355 and 650 kg. Another estimate gives a shoulder height of and a weight of . A medium- to large-sized stegodont, S. florensis, with a body weight of about 1,700 kg, appeared about 850,000 years ago, and then also evolved into a dwarf form, S. f. insularis, with an estimated body mass of about 570 kg. Another estimate gives a shoulder height of and a weight of . The latter was contemporaneous with, and hunted by, the dwarf hominin Homo floresiensis, and disappeared about 49,600 years ago, earlier than initially thought. Dwarf stegodonts were believed to be the main prey of the still- extant Komodo dragon before modern humans introduced their modern main prey in its range, banded pig, rusa deer, and water buffalo.Diamond, Jared M. (1987). \\"Did Komodo dragons evolve to eat pygmy elephants?\\". Nature. 326 (6116): 832. Taxonomy Fossils of S. aurorae (left) and S. orientalis (right) at the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo Skull of S. ganesha Philippine National Museum In the past, stegodonts were believed to be the ancestors of the true elephants and mammoths, but currently they are believed to have no modern descendants. Stegodon may be derived from Stegolophodon, an extinct genus known from the Miocene of Asia. Stegodon is considered to be a sister group of elephants and mammoths. Some taxonomists consider the stegodonts a subfamily of the Elephantidae. Both Stegolophodon and primitive elephants were derived from the Gomphotheriidae. The most important difference between Stegodon and (other) Elephantidae can be observed in the molars. Stegodont molars consist of a series of low, roof-shaped ridges, whereas in elephants, each ridge has become a high-crowned plate. Furthermore, stegodont skeletons are more robust and compact than those of elephants. In Bardia National Park in Nepal, a population of Indian elephants, possibly due to inbreeding, exhibits many Stegodon-like morphological features. These primitive features are considered recent mutations rather than atavisms. Fossils of the small, specialized stegodont S. aurorae are found in the Osaka Plain, Japan, and date from around 2 million to 7 million years ago. This species possibly evolved from S. shinshuensis.

In 2000, it moved from the Office Division to the Specialized Devices and Applications Group inside the Entertainment and Devices Division, and is now back inside the Microsoft Office division.  History  Prior to the creation of the Mac BU, Microsoft had developed Macintosh software, starting in 1984 with Word 1.0 for Macintosh. During the early and mid 1990s, Microsoft's Word, Excel, and Powerpoint teams simultaneously developed Windows and Macintosh versions of these applications, but after releasing Office 97 for Windows, Microsoft decided, in January 1997, to form a separate Macintosh Business Unit to focus on creating applications optimized for the Macintosh platform. In August 1997, as part of a broader partnership agreement with Apple, Microsoft committed to continue developing and supporting Macintosh software for at least 5 more years, renewing this pledge on January 10, 2006 at the Macworld Conference & Expo. Ben Waldman was the Mac BU's founder and first General Manager (GM), serving from its inception in January 1997 through January 2000, when he was succeeded by Kevin Browne, who served through December 18, 2002, and Roz Ho, who served from December 18, 2002 to June 8, 2007; after that, Craig Eisler became the GM.

Construction and commissioning S-32 was laid down on 12 April 1918 by the Union Iron Works in San Francisco, California. She was launched on 11 January 1919 sponsored by Miss Margaret Tynan, and commissioned on 15 June 1922 with Lieutenant Edward E. Hazlett, Jr., in command. Service history Pre- World War II Soon after commissioning, S-32, assigned to Submarine Division 17 and homeported at San Pedro, California, was ordered to New London, Connecticut. She was decommissioned there on 25 September 1922 and, after engineering alterations by the prime contractor, the Electric Boat Company, and the engineering sub-contractor, the New London Ship and Engine Company, she was recommissioned on 21 February 1923. Temporary duty with Division 11 then took her south to the Caribbean Sea and the Panama Canal Zone for winter exercises with the Fleet, after which she rejoined the S-boats of her division, now designated Division 16, and returned to San Pedro. During the summer of 1923, she participated in cold weather exercises in the Aleutian Islands. In the fall, she resumed local operations off southern California and that winter, she returned to the Canal Zone. In April 1924, she moved back to San Pedro, whence she operated into 1925. Early that year, however, her division was transferred to the Asiatic Fleet and its submarines shifted to Mare Island to prepare for the trans-Pacific crossing. On 15 April 1925, S-32 departed San Francisco, California, for the Philippines. She arrived at Cavite in mid-summer and through the winter of 1926 conducted local exercises in the Luzon area. That spring, she deployed to the China coast, conducting exercises both en route to and from her summer base, the former German base at Tsingtao. Overhaul followed her September return to the Philippines and completed an annual employment schedule which she maintained for the next six years. In 1932, Division 16 was ordered back to the eastern Pacific Ocean. S-32 departed Manila Bay on 2 May and, at the end of the month, arrived at Pearl Harbor, her homeport for the next five years. In June 1937, she sailed for the East Coast. In August, she reported for inactivation at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and, on 7 December, she was decommissioned and berthed at League Island.  World War II  Within two years, however, World War II had begun in Europe. Hostilities soon extended across the Atlantic; and, in the summer of 1940, S-32 began activation. Recommissioned on 18 September 1940 and assigned to Division 52, S-32 conducted trials out of New London through November and, in December, proceeded to the Panama Canal Zone, whence she operated until April 1941. She then returned to New London but, toward the end of April, moved south again, to Bermuda. Through May, she patrolled and conducted training exercises out of the base at St. George, Bermuda, that had been acquired in the Destroyers for Bases Agreement of 2 September 1940. In late June, she resumed exercises out of New London. In September, she moved down to Philadelphia for an overhaul and, by December, she was back in Connecticut. With 1942, however, she received orders back to Panama.  First, Second, and Third War Patrols  She arrived at Coco Solo in February. During the spring, she conducted two defensive patrols in the Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal and, in June, she proceeded to San Diego, California, en route to the Aleutians. In early July, she arrived at Dutch Harbor; and, on 7 July, she departed that Unalaska base on her first offensive war patrol. She patrolled the fog-covered waters of the Rat Islands and Amchitka into August, then shifted to an area north of Attu, returning to Dutch Harbor on 10 July.  Fourth War Patrol  Twelve days later, she departed on her fourth war patrol. Moving westward, she hunted in the Japanese traffic lanes between Kiska and Attu during the first week of the patrol. On 28 July, leaks developed in the after trim tank, but were compensated for by placing nine tons of water in the forward trim tanks. Although this meant that space was left to accommodate water for only one torpedo reload, depth control was regained, and with fuel suction shifted forward, reload capability slowly improved. On 29 August, she was off Amchitka to check for enemy shipping in sheltered areas on that island's north coast; then, on 31 August, she headed east to cover the Allied occupation of Adak. On 14 September, she returned to the junction of Rat Island and Amchitka where she continued her patrol for another six days. On 20 September, she headed for Dutch Harbor.  Fifth War Patrol  Arriving on 23 September, S-32 departed again on 8 October. During a trim dive, a fuel discrepancy, caused by the presence of water in the line during fueling at Dutch Harbor, was discovered. On 12 October, the S-boat ran out of reserve fuel in the number-three main ballast tank. The discrepancy was approximately 9000 gallons, but S-32 continued west, into the Kuril Islands. On 17 October, she arrived off Paramushiro and, that evening, she took up station off the southeast coast of the island to patrol the entrances to Musashi Wan and Onekotan Strait. On the morning of 18 October, she sighted two ships at anchor in Musashi Wan, and, after a periscope check disclosed no other ships in the area, she began working her way to an attack position west or southwest of the targets. Moving slowly, with short and infrequent periscope exposures, through the calm and poorly charted bay, she went up for a final check at 10:23. While looking, she struck an uncharted sand bar. The S-boat, her tubes ready for firing, angled up 10 degrees. Her depth gauge showed . During the next few seconds she slid over the bar, apparently showing periscope shears, bow, and, possibly, the whole bridge structure; then, over the bar, she took a down angle at high speed. At 10:25, she fired. Two torpedoes set at six feet, were sent against each of the targets. On firing the fourth and final \\"fish\\", she changed course and maneuvered at high speed toward the open sea. Two explosions were heard as she cleared the immediate area. At 10:45, she came to periscope depth to observe the damage. One of the targets was afire amidships and had settled somewhat; she was anchored in shallow water and might have been resting on the bottom. The second target was obscured by the first. S-32 went to and proceeded out of the bay. At 12:05, she resumed her patrol east out of Onekotan Strait. That evening, she turned toward the Aleutians; and, on 27 October, she arrived at Dutch Harbor. From Dutch Harbor, S-32 returned to San Diego. Overhaul followed her 11 November arrival; and, from 21-25 December, she tested newly installed equipment: a fathometer, radar, and keel-mounted sound gear. From 28 December 1942 to 26 January 1943, she provided services to the West Coast Sound School, and on 6 February, she headed north toward Dutch Harbor.  Sixth War Patrol  S-32 departed Unalaska on her sixth war patrol on 25 February. En route to her assigned station off Attu, she encountered very rough seas, strong winds, rain, mist, and fog. On 26 February, rolling was measured as much as 65 degrees to starboard. Progress west was slow, but, on 1 March, she set a course toward Holtz Bay to check for enemy shipping. The next day, heavy mist and fog hindered her reconnaissance of Stellar Cove; and she turned to the coastal shipping lanes to intercept enemy traffic between Cape Wrangell and Holtz Bay. The entrances to the latter, to Chichagof Harbor, and to Sarana Bay, however were her primary hunting grounds. On the night of 9 March, off Holtz Bay, she attacked and damaged an enemy destroyer, then underwent a brief depth charging. Leaks caused by the depth charging were minimized, and S-32 continued her patrol. Four nights later, on 13 March, seventeen miles (27 km) north of Holtz Bay, she attacked an enemy submarine which was lying to on the surface with her engines smoking. At 20:59, the S-boat launched two torpedoes at ten-second intervals at the enemy. At 21:00, she went deep, and as she passed , one torpedo exploded. At 21:20, S-32 came to periscope depth, but the fog had closed in. The target was no longer visible. On the afternoon of 15 March, a second submarine was sighted. The weather, for the first time, was \\"perfect for a periscope approach.\\" At 17:27, S-32 fired a three-torpedo spread, estimated range ; track angle favorable. About two and a half minutes later, a muffled explosion was heard in the torpedo room. No explosion was heard by the control party. The S-boat went to periscope depth. Smoke was pouring skyward from the enemy's conning tower. A photograph was taken of the scene as the damaged target headed for the nearest beach. At 17:36, however, the enemy disappeared from view. Sound reported that the enemy's screws had stopped. S-32 departed the Attu area early on the morning of 17 March. On 20 March, she moored at Dutch Harbor and, nine days later, she again sailed west. En route to Attu, cold weather caused icing on the superstructure, but the seas remained fairly calm and the sun was occasionally visible. On 3 April, however, as she approached Attu, more normal Aleutian weather closed in. From then to 16 April, snow and rain storms were almost continuous, seas were rough, winds were strong, and periods of sunlight were limited. At 01:57 on 10 April, while patrolling on a north-south line out of Holtz Bay, S-32 picked up a target on radar, some away. Ten minutes later, a second smaller ship was detected ahead of the first target. Five minutes after the appearance of the second ship on the screen, the first ship was sighted, range about . S-32 launched four torpedoes. Two very loud explosions were heard and were followed by distant rumblings. At 0219, at a range of just over , all traces of the ships disappeared from the screen.  Seventh War Patrol  On 16 April, S-32 set a course for Dutch Harbor. On 20 April, she arrived and commenced refit. On 4 May, she again sailed west. En route to the Kurils, she patrolled across possible Japanese reinforcement routes to Kiska and Attu, but almost zero visibility during the passage hindered hunting. On 12 May, she entered her assigned area off Paramushiro. The next day, she obtained her first fix, off Onekotan, and commenced patrolling across the approaches to Onekotan Strait and Musashi Wan. Visibility remained poor; seas were rough. Her radar, which had gone out of commission on 11 May, functioned improperly throughout her short time on station. On 15 May, the port main motor armature developed a zero resistance to ground. Repeated repair attempts failed, and the motor was secured. S-32 turned back toward Unalaska and moored at Dutch Harbor on 23 May.  Later operations  On 27 May, the submarine departed the Aleutians for the last time; and, on 6 June 1943 she arrived at San Diego, where she provided training services for the remainder of World War II. Decommissionung and disposal Shortly after the war's end, S-32 was designated for inactivation, she arrived at San Francisco on 13 September 1945 and was decommissioned at Mare Island on 19 October. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1945, and her hulk was sold for scrapping to the Learner Company of Oakland, California, in May 1946. Awards and honors S-32 received five battle stars for her service in World War II. This was the highest number of battle stars earned by an S-Class submarine.

A former defence industry systems engineer,Forbes - August 2000 - Feature he claims to have had little interest in motor racing before programming his first racing game (Formula 3) back in 1984, but he holds a physics degree, which may explain the realism of some of his programming. As a consequence of that project he became a big fan of Formula One motor racing. At the end of the 80s, this interest, plus the ever improving capabilities of home computers, inspired him to specialise in programming Formula One racing simulations.  Games  One of his early releases was Aviator, a Spitfire simulator marketed for the BBC Micro by Acornsoft. Although displayed in only four colours and has few of the features of modern simulators for more powerful computers, Aviator was of unparalleled quality at the time of its release (c. 1983), with a realistic flight model that included g-forces that could tear the wings off in a dive. This would be accompanied by a continuous high pitched beep. The wings could be restored by removing the physical pressure on the airframe which was causing the flight envelope to be exceeded. Generally, this could be achieved by returning the joystick to a neutral centre position. The landscape was crudely rendered, and was basically a plane. Some scenic features were drawn as vector graphics, including low hills, fields, a lake, a suspension bridge over a river, and a small town which comprised a cluster of three buildings. Bonus points could be earned for flying under the bridge or along the main street of the town at a lower altitude than the buildings. Double points were earned for performing these stunts upside down. The game also had a shoot-'em-up mode in which alien vessels were seeded in the fields, feeding on the crops and growing until they could become airborne, at which point they headed for the town. The player could destroy the aliens on the ground as they fed, or (for reduced points) tackle them in the air (the aliens were agile but could not return fire). If an alien reached the town, the game was lost. A minor bug permitted the plane to be landed upside down without consequence, so long as the landing gear had been deployed. Although better known for his Formula One simulation games on the PC and Amiga platforms, his first motor racing simulator was REVS, a Formula Three simulator that debuted on the BBC Micro platform in 1984. The BBC version of Revs featured just one track, the Silverstone circuit, but the realistic implementation of motor racing physics and artificial intelligence of the computer controlled components gave the game enormous depth and replayability. A Commodore 64 version of the game, entitled Revs Plus, was released in 1986, which added the Brands Hatch track to the game. An enhanced edition of the BBC version was later released called 'REVS 4 Tracks' which included Brands Hatch, Donington Park, Oulton Park and Snetterton race tracks. Later the Commodore 64 version added the N√ºrburgring to this list to continue the \\"4 Tracks\\" theme as Brands Hatch had already been included with the initial REVS Plus release. The N√ºrburgring was chosen as its new layout had recently been completed and computer based design data was available. This gives an idea of just how accurate REVS was as a simulation rather than 'just' a game. The Sentinel was published by Firebird on the BBC Micro in 1986. It was a 3D puzzle game, featuring ten thousand levels, in which the player had to manoeuvre his way through a landscape of cliffs, trees and boulders to topple the ominous Sentinel. The game was a critical and commercial success. Conversions for the ZX Spectrum, C64, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and PC soon followed. A sequel, Sentinel Returns, was published by Psygnosis in 1998 on the PC and PlayStation platforms. Crammond's attention returned to motor racing simulators. Stunt Car Racer was a slightly offbeat driving simulation, rewarding the player for performing outrageous stunts on a number of elevated, roller-coaster-like courses. Although less serious in tone than his previous simulators, the game nevertheless used an impressive physics engine to offer a realistic driving experience. The game enjoyed cult status among many Amiga and Atari ST gamers. Ever since the early 1990s, Crammond's primary focus has been on developing the award-winning Formula One Grand Prix series of games. The first game in the series, F1GP (aka World Circuit in the USA), was released by MicroProse on the Amiga in 1991 and is essentially the spiritual successor to Revs. Around this time Amiga Power magazine began referring to him as Sir Geoff, a running gag which has caught on with many others. The game was an instant success, earning a conversion to the Atari ST and PC platforms, but the inevitable sequel, Grand Prix 2, remained in development for three years before eventually being released on the PC in 1996. Grand Prix 3 was released on the PC in 2000 and was well received by fans and critics alike.http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/grand-prix-3 Crammond's series now had considerable competition from other developers, particularly Psygnosis/Sony, who were licensed by the FIA to produce the official Formula One gaming titles. Grand Prix 4 was released on the PC in 2002 and is generally regarded as the most accurate game in the series. After Grand Prix 4 there were rumours that Crammond's next game would be Stunt Car Racer Pro, an updated version of his classic game. The rumours were later confirmed with an announcement that he was co-operating with Lost Toys studios. Lost Toys studios were closed in late 2003. At the beginning of 2005, the game was rumoured to be cancelled. Crammond's most recent game release is still GP4 (2002), which is still supported by fans with annual mods, in spite of MicroProse's closure in 2001. Following that, Crammond kept a low profile, but continues to engage in various programming projects.

Auburn is located west of the Sydney central business district and is in the local government area of Cumberland City Council, having previously been the administrative centre of Auburn Council.Liberty Plains: a history of Auburn N.S.W. - Centenary edition Auburn prides itself as one of the most multicultural communities in Australia. The traditionally immigrant Anglo- Celtic European population has slowly been replaced by a high percentage of immigrants from Afghan, Turkish, Lebanese, and Chinese backgrounds. History Origins The suburb was named after Oliver Goldsmith's poem The Deserted Village, which describes 'Auburn' in England as the loveliest village of the plain.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 11 The Auburn area was once used by Aboriginal people as a market place for the exchange of goods, a site for ritual battles and a 'Law Place' for ceremonies. The area was located on the border between the Darug inland group and the Eora/Dharawal coastal group. The Wangal and Wategoro, sub-groups or clans, are the groups most often recognised as the original inhabitants of the Auburn/Homebush Bay region. Bennelong, one of the most famous Aboriginies of the time, was a member of Wangal, as was his wife, Barangaroo. Pemulwuy, who organised tribes to resist the white settlement of the Sydney region from 1790 to 1802 was also a member of the Wangal. On 5 February 1788, soon after the landing of Captain Phillip at Sydney Cove, Captain John Hunter and Lieutenant William Bradley sailed up what is now known as the Parramatta River, as far as Homebush Bay. Captain Hunter was the first white person to set foot within the Auburn Local Government Area. Ten days later, the Governor, along with a well- armed party in three boats, reached Homebush Bay. They ventured about inland. The following day a party of explorers traced the river in a westerly direction, coming to the place where the Duck River enters the Parramatta River. They explored the tributary as far as the depth of water permitted. Seeing what appeared to be ducks rising out of a swamp covered with reeds, they named the river Duck River. The ducks were actually Eastern Swamp Hens, but the name Duck River remained. The Eastern Swamp Hen featured prominently on the Council's Coat of Arms and was part of the former Auburn City Council logo. Settlement In February 1793 Auburn area was established as the first free-agricultural settlement thanks to Governor Phillip's repeated applications to the British government for free settlers. Phillip was of the opinion that only free settlers with the assistance of convicts will be able to create an environment in which a country could support its inhabitants. Secretary Dundas endorsed Governor's opinion and secured an agreement with several farmers, some of them were members of Religious Society of Friends ‚Äì Quakers, to settle in the colony. The first grants were given to Thomas Rose, Frederic Meredith, Thomas and Joseph Webb as well as Edward Powell. The deeds of the land described the farms' location as Liberty Plains and this is the name given to the neighbourhood of their farms by the first settles, although the actual area bearing that name was a little further, lying at the upper part of Port Jackson. Dwellers of the Liberty Plains Parish were very proud of the fact that in the colony of felons they were the first people who came to Australia as free men and were given a privilege of choosing their own grants. When in 1876 Auburn adopted its name, inspired by Oliver Goldsmith's poem The Deserted Village, describing the English village of Auburn as \\"the loveliest village of the plain\\", the people of Auburn still wanted to emphasise the fact that they were free settles. Hence, the first Auburn coat of arms depicted this in its motto: \\"Liberty, with steady zeal\\". One of the early settlers in the area was Fred Chisholm, who had an estate west of the present site of Auburn railway station. In the 1880s, John Buchanan, a timber merchant, purchased land from Fred Chisholm and built his home, Duncraggarn Hall, a two- storey Italianate mansion with a central tower and elaborate wrought-iron balconies. In 1892, Buchanan sold his thirteen-acre estate to the Sisters of Charity, who turned the house into St Joseph's Hospital for Consumptives. In 1903, extensions to the hospital were constructed and the house itself became a convent for the sisters. Further modifications and extensions took place over the years, with the eventual result that the old hospital site became St Joseph's Village‚Äîa retirement village‚Äîwith a modern hospital next door. Duncraggarn Hall is heritage-listed.State Heritage Register Auburn council The formal Auburn Local Government Area was formed in 1948, when Auburn and Lidcombe Councils merged into Auburn Municipal Council. In 2006 it became the City of Auburn which in 2016 was split between other local government areas.Local Government (City of Parramatta and Cumberland) Proclamation 2016 NSW Government 20th century and immigration In the late 20th century, Auburn became a popular point of settlement for successive waves of immigrants. In the post-World War II era, immigrants from the Ukraine, Russia, Italy and Greece settled in Auburn, who were succeeded in the 1960s by immigrants from Turkey and Vietnam. More recently, a large number of immigrants have settled in Auburn from China and Afghanistan. The history of immigrant settlement in Auburn has resulted in a suburb which is noted for its multicultural environment.  Heritage listings  Auburn has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Great Southern and Western railway: Auburn Railway Signal Box * 93 Parramatta Road: Electricity Substation No. 167 Commercial area Auburn has a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial areas. A commercial area is located close to Auburn railway station. There are many multicultural restaurants and cafes. South of the railway station, the commercial area stretches for approximately and features many shops, restaurants and supermarkets, including a number of shops and restaurants specialising in Middle Eastern, Turkish and East Asian products and cuisine. This reflects Auburn's history as a popular place of settlement for successive waves of immigrants in Sydney. It is a focal point especially for significant events such as football matches or political developments in the Middle East. Some distance north of the town centre clustered around the railway station, commercial and industrial developments are also located along the length of Parramatta Road and surrounding streets. It is home to the LFL team Auburn Wildcats who play in the Australian Eastern Conference as it is one of 6 teams in Sydney who represent this league. There are 40 teams in total of the LFL Australia and 12 are located in NSW.

The Sri Mandir in Auburn is Australia's oldest Hindu temple, having opened in 1977. The Auburn Gallipoli Mosque took thirteen years to construct and was largely funded by the Turkish community in the area.Gallipoli Mosque The name of the mosque reflects the legacy of Gallipoli in Turkey and the shared bond between Australian society and the Australian Turkish Muslim Community who constructed the mosque. Foundation and planning for the mosque to be built started with Bahattin Ozdemir (President of the Mosque at that time). He brought over plans from Turkey made by Architect Omer Kirazoglu designed it in the Classical Ottoman Style of Architecture characterised by a central dome and minarets. The builder was Ahmet Asim who donated much of his time. It is a source of pride for the local community and whilst considered a Turkish mosque it is frequented by all sections of the Islamic community and is one of Sydney's busiest mosques.

Generally, absenteeism is unplanned absences. Absenteeism has been viewed as an indicator of poor individual performance, as well as a breach of an implicit contract between employee and employer. It is seen as a management problem, and framed in economic or quasi-economic terms. More recent scholarship seeks to understand absenteeism as an indicator of psychological, medical, or social adjustment to work.  Workplace  High absenteeism in the workplace may be indicative of poor morale, but absences can also be caused by workplace hazards or sick building syndrome. Measurements such as the Bradford factor, a measurement tool to analyze absenteeism which believes short, unplanned absences effect the work group more than long term absences, do not distinguish between absence for genuine illness reasons and absence for non-illness related reasons. In 2013, the UK CIPD estimated that the average worker had 7.6 absent days per year and which cost employers ¬£595 per employee annually.CIPD. (2017). 2016 annual survey report of absence management. Retrieved from absence- management_2016_tcm18-16360.pdf. Measurement methods are not exact and all encompassing, resulting in skewed results depending on variables being observed. As a result, employees can feel obliged to come to work while ill, and transmit communicable diseases to their co-workers. This leads to even greater absenteeism and reduced productivity among other workers. View the latest trends in health-related workplace absenteeism in the United States. Work forces often excuse absenteeism caused by medical reasons if the employee provides supporting documentation from their medical practitioner. In Poland, if employees themselves, or anyone under their care including children and elders, falls ill, sick leave can be applied. The psychological model that discusses this is the \\"withdrawal model\\", which assumes that absenteeism represents individual withdrawal from dissatisfying working conditions. This finds empirical support in a negative association between absence and job satisfaction, in particular, the satisfaction with the work itself. Factors attributed to absence from work can include stress, family related concerns, work culture, the employees ability to do the job, and supervisor-subordinate relationship. Medical-based understanding of absenteeism finds support in research that links absenteeism for medical reasons with mental and behavioral disorders, diseases of the digestive system, neoplasms, and diseases of the genitourinary system. This excludes pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium. The cost of this, in euros, is 7.43 billion per year for men and 9.66 billion for females (6.7 billion euro after taking out pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium.) Research shows that over one trillion dollars are lost annually due to productivity shortages as a result of medical-related absenteeism. The line between psychological and medical causation is blurry, given that there are positive links between both work stress and depression, and absenteeism. Depressive tendencies may lie behind some of the absence ascribed to poor physical health, as with adoption of a \\"culturally approved sick role\\". This places the adjective \\"sickness\\" before the word \\"absence\\", and carries a burden of more proof than is usually offered. Evidence indicates that absence is generally viewed as \\"mildly deviant workplace behavior.\\" For example, people tend to hold negative stereotypes of absentees, under report their own absenteeism, and believe their own attendance record is better than that of their peers. Negative attributions about absence then bring about three outcomes: the behavior is open to social control, sensitive to social context, and is a potential source of workplace conflict. One tactic companies use to combat unplanned absences is the notion of paying back unused sick time.  Managing  Absenteeism is a habitual pattern correlated with emotional labor and personal reasoning, but there are resolutions to finding ways to alleviate the cause. Kelley, et al. (2016) says stress accounts for twelve percent of absenteeism in the workplace a year, which is a matter in which the company needs to stay in communication with the employee and work towards a solution. A great example of finding progress is forming an employee assistantship program (EAP), which is \\"a strategy to help workers deal with issues outside of work that employees bring to the workplace\\" (Quinley, 2003). This not only involves stress, but other mental health factors that employees deem worthy of attention. EAP can help those employees bring a more positive attitude to work, which can allude to the creation of a positive workplace environment. Another matter in which employees' absenteeism can be reduced is involving the employees' personal matters (i.e. children at home, ill family, etc.) and the willingness of the company to be flexible. Perfect attendance is hard to accomplish in the workplace. Outside matters always play factors in absences, which can be spontaneous and uncontrollable. Flexibility is a key factor when working a balanced business, and it's important for communication to flow effectively in the workplace. Every company is different, and absence in the workplace should be limited. Effective communication can help in this effort to avoid problems in the workplace. Absenteeism not only affects the individual(s) work, but also the company from a group standpoint. Communication remains top priority when dealing with absenteeism. Communicating and willing to work together to achieve a common goal is a main reason that managing this pattern effectively are ways to avoid absenteeism in the workplace.  Planned vs unplanned  Planned absences from work include scheduled time off, retirement, and sabbaticals. These absences cause little to no disruption to work spaces because of the time given to work around the absence. Unplanned absence from work is defined as leave that is not planned or predictable. It includes sick time off, injured time off, special circumstances, and absence without permission. Unplanned absences indicate an important factor of the health of the workplace, including employee satisfaction and commitment.  Bullying  Nearly every workplace that has a bully in charge will have elevated staff turnover and absenteeism.Robert Killoren (2014) The Toll of Workplace Bullying - Research Management Review, Volume 20, Number 1  Narcissism and psychopathy  According to Thomas, there tends to be a higher level of stress with people who work or interact with a narcissist, which in turn increases absenteeism and staff turnover.. Boddy finds the same dynamic where there is a corporate psychopath in the organization..  In school  While occasional school absenteeism may not be problematic, excessive absenteeism has shown to have a negative impact. Students with poor attendance records are found to be at a disadvantage both academically and socially. Compared to their peers, these students are more at risk of academic under-performance and early school leaving. They are also at risk of having more restricted opportunities in terms of further education and employment, and are likely to experience social and emotional problems in adulthood.Thornton, M., Darmody, M., & McCoy, S. (2013). Persistent absenteeism among Irish primary school pupils. Educational Review, 65(4), 488-501. doi:10.1080/00131911.2013.768599 Missing school can be a habit- forming behavior and can be challenging to deal with despite growing awareness of the causes of absenteeism. Research evidence suggests that early interventions are six times more likely to be successful than those after students' non-attendance has reached the persistent stage.Reid, K. (2012). The strategic management of truancy and school absenteeism: finding solutions from a national perspective. Educational Review, 64(2), 211-222. doi:10.1080/00131911.2011.598918 Equally, there is normally one initial reason, referred to as \\"the trigger point\\", for the students' non-attendance. By the time students' absences have reached the persistent stage, there are at least several more reasons used to justify the action. There are positive and negative reinforcements regarding student absenteeism. A positive reinforcement meaning that the student will receive either more attention from their parent or guardian, or receive tangible benefits from not going to school. A negative reinforcement meaning that the student is avoiding school. Dube and Orpinas conducted a study by surveying 99 upper-elementary and middle schools, targeting students with attendance problems. Three major profiles were identified from these students. Dube and Orpinas found that 17.2 percent missed school to avoid fear, anxiety problems, or escape from social or evaluative situations; 60.6 percent missed school to gain parental attention or tangible benefits; and 22.2 percent had no profile.Dube, Shanta R. and Pamela Orpinas. \\"Understanding Excessive School Absenteeism as School Refusal Behavior.\\" Children & Schools, vol. 31, no. 2, Apr. 2009, pp. 87-95. EBSCOhost All three groups significantly differed in mean scores for behavioral difficulties. Children who fit within multiple profiles had the highest level of behavioral problems, and children in the no-profile group had the lowest. Children with multiple profiles had higher mean scores on frequency of victimization and total number of traumatic or stressful events than did those in the other groups. Although there are many theories to treating absenteeism, there is no universal treatment. There is however, a step by step process identified by Evie Bald, to manage absenteeism. This process includes identifying chronic absenteeism, identifying the reasoning behind the absences, work with families to address issues, and offer positive reinforcements if necessary.Blad, E. (2017). Schools Fight Back Against Chronic Absenteeism: Districts work to ensure students are in school. Education Week, 37(9), 5-8.

One of the smallest towns in Shropshire, it was granted its market charter in 1253. The town is usually referred to simply as 'Cleobury'. Several pronunciations of the town's name are in use. In Cleobury itself is commonly used, while in surrounding areas variations such as and are used. History The name is believed to derive from the contraction of the Old English meaning a steep place and bury meaning fortified settlement. Mortimer comes from Ranulph de Mortimer of Normandy to whom the land was granted after the Norman conquest. He founded the Mortimer dynasty of Marcher Lords who held power in the Welsh Marches throughout the Middle Ages and were closely involved with power struggles with successive English monarchs and other powerful Lords. Cleobury has a significant entry in the Domesday Book, and the vicinity was the location of at least two castles. Cleobury Castle, which was situated near St Mary's Church, was destroyed in 1155 and only earthworks remain today. Toot Castle was situated on the other side of the River Rea from the town. The centre of Cleobury in 1950. The central section of the town was laid out in burgage plots, the lines of which are still evident. With the decline of the Marcher Lords, and peace along the Welsh border, Cleobury's importance declined during the Middle Ages, leaving it as an undistinguished market town, albeit with a dependent hinterland. In the 16th century, exploitation of local iron ores became important, and when Elizabeth I granted the town to Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, his familiarity with modern ironworking technology led to the establishment of an important iron industry, with at least two furnaces (in which iron ore was converted to pig iron) and two water-powered forges (in which pig iron was converted to wrought iron). For a while, Cleobury's iron industry was an important part of the general industrialisation in Shropshire (sometimes claimed as the seat of the Industrial Revolution), and iron from Cleobury's forges was valued as a high- quality material. However, poor transport connections led to the decline of Cleobury's iron industry in the early 19th century, and soon the town reverted to being an agricultural hub, although a large water-powered paper mill survived on the River Rea until a catastrophic fire towards the end of the century. By 1900, the town was an important civic centre, with a railway station, union workhouse, magistrates' court, police station, Agricultural College, Infants' School and Primary School. Since the start of the twentieth century, Cleobury lost many of these facilities, although its population has grown. It thus exemplifies a common pattern for rural settlements, where centralisation and the rise of road transport have seen a decline in the local provision of services, despite a rising population. Two literary figures have strong connections with Cleobury: William Langland and Simon Evans. Langland, a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, was almost certainly born in the vicinity in the 14th century, and is commemorated in the very fine and intricate (Victorian) East Window of St Mary's Church, as well as in a local road name. Simon Evans is a 20th-century writer, who fought throughout the First World War, and suffered from being gassed. He had been a postman on Merseyside before the war, and after the war sought a rural postal round, to soothe both nerves and body. Cleobury suited him well; here he blossomed, took a correspondence course in English, and became a successful writer and radio broadcaster in the 1930s. Heath Cranton published five of his books, and he married 'Auntie Doris' (Aldridge), a radio performer, but his new life was cut short in 1940, when the effects of the gassing finally caught up with him. His legacy is visible in the naming of a local street, a plaque on the old Post Office, and a dedicated local walk ‚Äì 'The Simon Evans Way' ‚Äì which the CM Footpath Association has created in recent years. Geography The A4117 as it passes through the town. The River Rea runs to the east of the town, whilst through the town itself is the Pudding (or Burrell) Brook, which flows from west to east before meeting the Rea. The land gradually rises from 110 metres above sea level near to the river, to 150 metres in the west of the town. The Clee Hills, the highest hills in Shropshire, are nearby and the Wyre Forest lies between the town and Bewdley. The border with Worcestershire is a mile to the south. The A4117 Kidderminster to Ludlow road runs through the centre of the town and crosses the River Rea at New Bridge. The B4363 runs between Cleobury Mortimer (its junction with the A4117 being immediately east of New Bridge) and Bridgnorth. The county town, Shrewsbury, is some distant by road, making Cleobury the most distant town from Shrewsbury in the county. Cleobury was formerly served by two now-defunct railways: the Tenbury & Bewdley Railway and the Cleobury Mortimer and Ditton Priors Light Railway. The opening of the latter in 1908 elevated Cleobury Mortimer station (which was located some distance from the town, in the Wyre Forest) to the status of a 'Junction'. A separate station called Cleobury Town existed nearer the town, but only on the Ditton Priors line. Today the nearest railway stations are on the heritage Severn Valley Railway, with the nearest mainline stations at Ludlow and Kidderminster. There is a regular bus service (Diamond Bus 292) that runs between Ludlow and Kidderminster via Cleobury. This was at one time part of a much longer service which operated between Hereford and Birmingham but was divided into separate routes several years ago. Historically The civil parish of Cleobury Mortimer has no notable settlements other than the town itself, though covers a large rural area including part of the Wyre Forest. In 2017, the parish council officially gave notice to Shropshire Council that it would thereafter be styled Cleobury Mortimer Town Council, although it does not elect a mayor. To the north lie the settlements of Neenton and Neen Savage, and to the southwest lies the small village of Neen Sollars. \\"Neen\\" was the name of the River Rea in the past.Raven, Michael (2005) A Guide to Shropshire p 144 Further to the north lies Cleobury North, a small village with the same etymological root. Governance An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward stretches mainly to the North and at the 2011 Census had a population of 7,226. Landmarks and amenities St Mary's church There are a number of landmarks in the town, the most famous of which is the 12th- century St. Mary's churchThe church spine is a point within the book The Giant, The Witch & the Rainbow. Many focal points of Cleobury Mortimer are in the book like the Wells, Mawley Hall and Clee Hill.For more information see the Cleobury Benefice website in the town centre, renowned for its crooked spire, the combined result of the warping of its oak timbers, and damp-induced rot where the timber spire sits on the masonry tower. Across the road from the churchyard is The Wells, fed from a local spring and for centuries serving as a public water supply. In 2010, for reasons as yet unexplained, the inflow to The Wells ceased for a while, and has only been intermittent since then. To the west of the church is the recently refurbished Market Hall, which now houses a number of facilities including the Tourist Information Centre. There are six public houses in the town of Cleobury, with a further one (the Blount Arms) on the A4117 road in the direction of Kidderminster.Shropshire Pub Survey Cleobury Mortimer The town also has a secondary school, Lacon Childe,Lacon Childe School a primary school, a library, a post office and a fire station; until 2014 it also had a police station. The town featured in a series of reports by Declan Curry in BBC Breakfast in June 2006. As part of the series, Curry interviewed a number of local residents and business owners to learn more about the rural economy. Brewery The King's Arms with St Mary's churchyard in the foreground. Hobsons brewery was established in 1993 and moved to its present site at New House Farm, on Tenbury Road approximately 500 metres SW of the town centre, in 1995. The brewery brews and delivers its beer to public houses within a 50-mile radius, as well as bottle-conditioned ale to shops throughout the UK. Its regular mild, best bitter and strong bitter (Old Henry) ales have won taste awards, and the mild was chosen to be a guest beer in the House of Commons bar in 2008. Hobsons produce a bottle-only mild ale, named in honour of Simon Evans, called Postman's Knock. In 2009, the brewery installed a small wind turbine, which generates around a third of the electricity required by the brewery, and the company use other environmentally sustainable technologies. The King's Arms in the town became the brewery tap in 2007 and was the first pub to receive a delivery of Hobsons beer in 1993.

The film stars Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler. The film grossed $22.6 million and has an 8% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 39 critics. The film was released in the United States on September 6, 1996. Plot Archie Moses is a small-time thief in Los Angeles who smuggles drugs for drug lord Frank Colton, who launders his drug money through a car dealership. Moses is unaware that his best friend, Rock Keats, is actually LAPD undercover cop Jack Carter, who befriended him only to infiltrate Colton's gang. Carter has Moses include him in Colton's next drug shipment, secretly planning to arrest Colton and take in Moses, whom he has come to care about, unharmed. Carter's undercover status is revealed before he can enact his plan, however, and a hurt Moses pulls a gun on him. During the raid on Colton's warehouse, an out of control crane hits Moses in the back, causing him to accidentally shoot Carter in the head. Moses then flees the state, and is subsequently found and arrested. Carter miraculously survives and makes a full recovery with the aid of his physical therapist, Dr. Traci Flynn, with whom he falls in love. Moses is brought into custody, and he agrees to testify against Colton, but the trial is set to take place at the other side of the country. Carter's superior officer, Capt. Jensen, orders him to personally transfer Moses to the courtroom. Carter harbors resentment against Moses, and tensions escalate once the simple transfer goes awry. Colton learns through bribed federal agents and LAPD officers of Moses' attempt to testify against him. As they flee from Colton's men, Carter and Moses slowly mend their friendship, and are successful in returning to Carter's precinct. However, Colton apparently holds Flynn hostage, and blackmails Carter into turning Moses over in order to save Flynn. Carter and Moses pretend to comply with Colton, and shoot their way through Colton's guards. It is later revealed that Flynn is on Colton's payroll, and is responsible for leaking Carter's and Moses' whereabouts to Colton. Moses takes a bullet in the shoulder to save Carter's life, giving Carter time enough to arrest Flynn; Moses then shoots Colton dead. Moses gives the incriminating documents on Colton to Carter, who allows him to escape. Moses heads to Mexico to become a bullfighter, with Carter and Moses' mother later accompanying him.

Esther invited Haman and the king to two banquets. In the second banquet, she informed the king that Haman was plotting to kill her (and the other Jews). This enraged the king, who was further angered when (after leaving the room briefly and returning) he discovered Haman had fallen on Esther's couch, intending to beg mercy from Esther, but which the king interpreted as a sexual advance.Esther 7:2-8 On the king's orders, Haman was hanged from the 50-cubit-high gallows that had originally been built by Haman himself, on the advice of his wife Zeresh, in order to hang Mordechai.Esther 7:9-10 The bodies of Haman's ten sons were also hanged, after they died in battle against the Jews.Esther 9:6-14 \\"All the enemies of the Jews\\" were additionally killed by the Jews, 75,000 of them. The apparent purpose of this unusually high gallows can be understood from the geography of Shushan: Haman's house (where the pole was located) was likely in the city of Shushan (a flat area), while the royal citadel and palace were located on a mound about 15 meters higher than the city. Such a tall pole would have allowed Haman to observe Mordechai's corpse while dining in the royal palace, had his plans worked as intended.Yehuda Landy, Purim and the Persian Empire, p. 83  Haman in other sources   Midrash  According to midrash, his mother was named Amathlai daughter of Orvati.Bava Batra 91a In Rabbinical tradition, Haman is considered to be an archetype of evil and persecutor of the Jews. Having attempted to exterminate the Jews of Persia, and rendering himself thereby their worst enemy, Haman naturally became the center of many Talmudic legends. Being at one time extremely poor, he sold himself as a slave to Mordechai.Megillah 15a He was a barber at Kefar Karzum for the space of twenty-two years.Megillah 16a Haman had an idolatrous image embroidered on his garments, so that those who bowed to him at command of the king bowed also to the image.Esther Rabbah 7 Haman was also an astrologer, and when he was about to fix the time for the genocide of the Jews he first cast lots to ascertain which was the most auspicious day of the week for that purpose. Each day, however, proved to be under some influence favorable to the Jews. He then sought to fix the month, but found that the same was true of each month; thus, Nisan was favorable to the Jews because of the Passover sacrifice; Iyyar, because of the small Passover. But when he arrived at Adar he found that its zodiacal sign was Pisces, and he said, \\"Now I shall be able to swallow them as fish which swallow one another\\" (Esther Rabbah 7; Targum Sheni 3). Haman had 365 counselors, but the advice of none was so good as that of his wife, Zeresh. She induced Haman to build a gallows for Mordechai, assuring him that this was the only way in which he would be able to prevail over his enemy, for hitherto the just had always been rescued from every other kind of death. As God foresaw that Haman himself would be hanged on the gallows, He asked which tree would volunteer to serve as the instrument of death. Each tree, declaring that it was used for some holy purpose, objected to being soiled by the unclean body of Haman. Only the thorn-tree could find no excuse, and therefore offered itself for a gallows (Esther Rabbah 9; Midrash Abba Gorion 7 (ed. Buber, Wilna, 1886); in Targum Sheni this is narrated somewhat differently). Haman's lineage is given in the Targum Sheni as follows: \\"Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, son of ‚ÄòAda, son of Bizna‚Äôi, son of Aphlitus, son of Djosos, son of Peros, son of Hamdan, son of Talyon, son of Atnisomos, son of Harum, son of Harsum, son of Shegar, son of Genar, son of Parmashta, son of Vaizatha, son of Agag, son of Sumqar, son of Amalek, son of Eliphaz, son of Esau\\". There are apparently several generations omitted between Agag, who was executed by Samuel the prophet in the time of King Saul, and Amalek, who lived several hundred years earlier.  Josephus  Haman is mentioned by Josephus in his Antiquities of the Jews. Josephus's account of the story is drawn from the Septuagint translation of the Book of Esther and from other Greek and Jewish sources, some no longer extant. Septuagint In the LXX, Haman is called a \\"Macedonian\\" by Xerxes (see Esther 16:10). Scholars have had two different explanations for this naming. 1. Macedonian was used to replace the word \\"Mede\\", and emphasises this when he also says that there was no Persian blood in him. (In practice the Persians and the Medes co-ruled an empire, but there was great friction between them.) 2. Another opinion is that Xerxes was calling him a Macedonian Spy, due to his insistence on causing civil war within Persia between the Jews and the Persians. The Septuagint translates the \\"hang\\" () of Esther 7:9-10 as \\"crucify\\" or \\"impale\\" (), using the same verb later used in the New Testament's Gospel of Matthew. The fifty-cubit apparatus used in the execution is described ambiguously using a word () which could mean a tree, a club, a stave, a gibbet, a gallows, the vertical component of a cross for crucifixion, or anything made of wood, an ambiguity already present in the original ().  Vulgate  Crucifixion of Haman by Michelangelo, Sistine Chapel As in the Septuagint, the execution of Haman is ambiguous, suggestive of both hanging and crucifixion. The fifty-cubit object, described as xylon in the Septuagint (), is similarly ambiguously referred to as \\"wood\\" (). The Vulgate translation of Esther 7:10 furthermore refers to a , used elsewhere to describe the cross-piece in crucifixion, when describing the fate of Haman: . In the corner of the Sistine Chapel ceiling is a depiction in fresco of the execution of Haman by Michelangelo; Haman is shown crucified in a manner similar to typical Catholic depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus, though the legs are parted and the apparatus resembles a natural tree shorter than fifty cubits high.  Bible in English  Translations of the Book of Esther's description of Haman's execution have treated the subject variously. Wycliffe's Bible referred both to a tre (tree) and a iebat (gibbet), while Coverdale's preferred galowe (gallows). The Geneva Bible used tree but the King James Version established gallows and hang as the most common rendering; the Douay‚ÄìRheims Bible later used gibbet. Young's Literal Translation used tree and hang. The New International Version, Common English Bible, and New Living Translation all use impale for and pole for .  Purim traditions  The Jewish holiday of Purim commemorates the story of the deliverance of the Jews and the defeat of Haman. On that day, the Book of Esther is read publicly and much noise and tumult is raised at every mention of Haman's name. A type of ratchet noisemaker called in Hebrew a ra'ashan (◊®◊¢◊©◊ü) (in Yiddish: \\"grogger\\" or \\"hamandreyer\\") is used to express disdain for Haman. Pastry known as hamentashen (Yiddish for 'Haman's pockets'; known in Hebrew as ◊ê◊ñ◊†◊ô ◊î◊û◊ü ozney Haman 'Haman's ears') are traditionally eaten on this day. Etymology and meaning of the name The name has been equated with the Persian name OmanesEncyclopaedia Judaica CD-ROM Edition 1.0 1997, Haman (Old Persian: êé°êé∂êé¥êé°êèÅ ImƒÅni≈°) recorded by Greek historians. Several etymologies have been proposed for it: it has been associated with the Persian word Hamayun, meaning \\"illustrious\\" (naming dictionaries typically list it as meaning \\"magnificent\\"); with the sacred drink Haoma; or with the Persian name Vohuman, meaning \\"good thoughts\\". The 19th-century Bible critic Jensen associated it with the Elamite god Humban, a view dismissed by later scholars.A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Book of Esther, Lewis Bayles Paton, The Biblical World, Vol. 33, No. 2 (Feb., 1909) Ahriman, a Zoroastrian spirit of destruction, has also been proposed as an etymon. In popular culture Haman appeared in The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible episode \\"Queen Esther\\". The 1994 animated television film Scooby-Doo! in Arabian Nights depicts Haman as an evil vizier to the sultan in its story segment, \\"Aliyah- Din\\". Mr. Lunt portrayed this biblical figure in the 2000 VeggieTales episode \\"Esther the Girl who Became Queen\\". In the South Park episode \\"Jewbilee\\", Haman is depicted as the primary antagonist, trying to enter the mortal world once more to rule over the Jews. Rhett Butler mentions Haman in Gone With the Wind when he is in jail facing the prospect of hanging.

It was known as Brongos in antiquity.  Origin  The West Morava originates in the Ta≈°ti field, east of the town of Po≈æega, from the Golijska Moravica and ƒêetinja headstreams. ƒêetinja receives from the left its main tributary, the Skrape≈æ. Less than a kilometer after the confluence, it meets the Golijska Moravica flowing from the south, forming the West Morava. Given the proximity of the confluences of ƒêetinja, Skrape≈æ and Golijska Moravica, some sources consider all three rivers to be direct headstreams of the West Morava River. Following the direction of the course, the ƒêetinja is a natural headstream of the West Morava. But, since Golijska Moravica is 23 km longer, the latter is considered as the main headstream. Measured from the source of the Golijska Moravica, the West Morava is 282 km long; the length of the West Morava proper is 184 km.  Course  Unlike the South and Great Morava's meridian (south-to-north) flow, the West Morava runs in an opposed, latitudinal (west-to-east) direction, dividing the region of ≈†umadija of the central Serbia from the southern parts of the country. Due to the West Morava's direction, it flows between many mountains, regions and sub-regions: * between the regions of Zlatibor (Srbija) to the north and Dragaƒçevo to the south; here it receives the Bjelica from the south and the small town of Luƒçani, center of Dragaƒçevo, is located in the vicinity, south of the river. * between the Ovƒçar (north) and Kablar (south) mountains; the river here carved the Ovƒçar-Kablar Gorge; the West Morava is dammed in the gorge (which is called Serbian Mount Athos, due to many monasteries) and again right after it, so the artificial Ovƒçar-Kablar and Meƒëuvr≈°je lakes are formed. * between the Takovo region (north) and Jelica mountain and Goraƒçiƒái region (south); here is located the town of ƒåaƒçak, the river is dammed again (Lake Parmenac) and receives many tributaries (mostly from the left: the ƒåemernica, Bresniƒçka reka, Laƒëevaƒçka reka); at this point, the river enters the low valley of Zapadno Pomoravlje, meanders and floods often, so from now on the major settlements will be further from the river (Goriƒçani, Laƒëevci, Mrƒçajevci). * between the Kotlenik mountain and the Gru≈æa region (north) and the Stolovi mountains (south); the town of Kraljevo and its suburbs of Adrani and Ratina are located south of the river, where the Ibar empties into the West Morava from the right; also from the right it receives the Tovarnica and from the left, the Gru≈æa. * between the mountains of Glediƒáke planine (north) and Goƒç (south); the most famous Serbian spa, Vrnjaƒçka Banja, its suburbs of Vrnjci and Novo Selo, the industrial town of Trstenik and the monastery of Ljubostinja are located in this section. * between the regions of Temniƒá (north) and Rasina (south); several large villages are located north of the river (Medveƒëa, Velika Drenova, Kukljin, Bo≈°njane, while the village of Globoder, town of Kru≈°evac and its suburbs of Jasika, Pepeljevac, Parunovac and ƒåitluk are located south of it. North of the small town of Stalaƒá, the West and Ju≈æna Morava meet and form the Great Morava.  Economy  The West Morava river valley, Zapadno Pomoravlje, is economically the most developed of all three Morava river valleys. With the valley of the Ibar, the West Morava has a huge potential in electricity production (the Ovƒçar (6 MW) and Meƒëuvr≈°je (7 MW) hydroelectric power plants). Water is also used for the irrigation and for the same purpose the artificial lake Parmenac is created on the river, thus helping the already fertile region (grains, orchards). Also, out of all three Morava rivers, the West Morava's valley is the most forested one. The watershed of the West Morava is rich in ores, (the Ibar section most of all), and includes the mining of hard coal, magnesite, chromium, etc. As a result, the industry is very developed with a string of heavily industrialized towns: U≈æice, Po≈æega, ƒåaƒçak, Kraljevo, Trstenik and Kru≈°evac. The traffic is also important for the economy as the whole of the river valley is a natural route for the both roads and railways connecting eastern, central and western Serbia.  Characteristics  Altogether, the West Morava receives 85 tributaries. The river used to be longer (319 km), but due to the regulation of the flow, it is shorter now. The West Morava has an average discharge of 120 m¬≥/s, but it is characterized by extreme fluctuations, which results in severe floods. The West Morava drains an area of 15,754 km¬≤ (41.2% of the entire Great Morava watershed), belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin and it is not navigable. When melioration program began in 1966, it was projected that it will become navigable from Kru≈°evac to ƒåaƒçak. In the central section of the flow, the special nature reserve Osredak was established in February 2020, and placed under the state protection.

It is located in the heart of Mysore city adjacent to the railway station. Founded in 1924 by Sri Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV , it is the first medical college to be established in the Karnataka region and the seventh in India. The college is affiliated to the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, Jayanagar, Bangalore. History Sri Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV founded Mysore Medical College. Since there were no medical institutions in the erstwhile state of Mysore, a scheme for giving medical education was started in 1881 under which carefully selected students were given scholarship and sent to places like Madras and Bombay to undergo training and to return and work as \\"Hospital Assistants\\". After the Madras Presidency expressed its inability to admit Mysore State students, the Government of Mysore sanctioned another scheme in April 1917 including a \\"Mysore Medical School\\", which was started at Bangalore to train the then called \\"Sub Assistant Surgeons\\". Trainees had to undergo a course for 4 years to qualify as a Licensed Medical Practitioner (LMP). In 1924 the \\"Mysore Medical School\\" was upgraded and was now called the \\"Mysore Medical College\\". The college was affiliated to the University of Mysore and the trainees were now granted medical degrees. Mysore Medical College was the first medical college in the state of Mysore and only the seventh in India at this time. At the request and insistence of Sri Krishnadevaraja Wodiyar the College was shifted from Bangalore to Mysore in 1930. The foundation stone was laid in 1930 by Sri Krishnadevaraja Wodiyar and the main building was constructed by Boraiah Basavaiah & Sons, a famous contractor of Mysore. It was further expanded in 1940. The Krishnarajendra Hospital (K R Hospital) was constructed at a cost of Rs. 3,65,000/- and started as a 100 bedded hospital with X-ray apparatus. It is attached to the Mysore Medical College. The Mysore Medical School continued functioning in Bangalore for a few years and was eventually shut down two years after Bangalore Medical College came into existence in 1954. Cheluvamba hospital, earlier known as Vanivilas Hospital, was built in 1880 with 24 beds, and was upgraded to a 200-bed hospital in 1939. It was further expanded in 1954 and the new OPD Block of OBG was built in 1997. New facilities have been continuously added onto the existing infrastructure, but the most impressive of all is the new multistoried OPD building with its ultra-modern air-conditioned ICCU which along with the medical wards on upper floors was added onto the K R Hospital complex in 1998. Other relatively new structures include a blood bank and a burns ward. It is attached to the Mysore Medical College. Admissions Under Graduate The total intake is 150 for MBBS course. Of this 85% is filled through the CET conducted by the Government of Karnataka and only residents of Karnataka are eligible. The rest 15% is All India Quota, open to any citizen of India, and is filled through the National Eligibility and Entrance Test from 2016.

It was used in humans during the 1950s as an antipsychotic, but is now almost exclusively used on animals as a sedative and antiemetic. Its closely related analogue, chlorpromazine, is still used as an antipsychotic in humans. Acepromazine is used primarily as a chemical restraint in hyperactive or fractious animals. The standard pharmaceutical preparation, acepromazine maleate, is used in veterinary medicine in dogs and cats. It is used widely in horses as a pre-anesthetic sedative and has been shown to reduce anesthesia related death. However, it should be used with caution (but is not absolutely contraindicated) in stallions due to the risk of paraphimosis and persistent priapism. Its potential for cardiac effects, namely hypotension due to peripheral vasodilation, can be profound and as such is not recommended for use in geriatric or debilitated animals. Pharmacology The clinical pharmacology of acepromazine is similar to that of other phenothiazine derived anti- psychotic agents. The primary behavioral effects are attributed to its potent antagonism of post-synaptic D2 receptors and, to a lesser degree, the other D2-like receptors. Additional effects are related to its appreciable antagonistic effects on various other receptors, including the Œ±1 receptors, H1 receptors, and mACh receptors. It is metabolized by the liver, oxidized to produce its primary metabolite, hydroxyethylpromazine sulfoxide, which is then excreted in the urine. Its action at the chemoreceptor trigger zone (in the area postrema) and the solitary nucleus (in the medulla oblongata) allow it to have an antiemetic effect. Veterinary use Canine and feline The most common uses of acepromazine in animals are as an oral sedative before stressful events (such as thunderstorms), an injectable tranquilizer for particularly aggressive or fractious animals, and when combined with opiates, a premedication or a post-operative pain reliever. It is also labeled for use in preventing motion sickness.Park E. Motion sickness. In: General Medical Officer (GMO) Manual: Clinical Section. Wilmette, IL: Brookside Press; 1999. Its effects as a CNS depressant means that less opiates are required to reach the same amount of sedation, and it prevents the arrhythmia and vomiting that many opiates induce. Its use as an oral sedative is somewhat controversial; acepromazine can increase sensitivity to noise and cause exaggerated startle reflexes. The dysphoric effect of phenothiazines and this increase in sensitivity can make some aggressive dogs and fractious cats more so. Adverse effects in cats While acepromazine is also used in cats, its absorption is erratic and can differ wildly from one cat to the next. It also generally induces less sedation than in dogs. It also causes spontaneous motor activity (in both cats and dogs, but more often in cats) by blocking dopamine receptors in the striatum and substantia nigra. Adverse effects in dogs Literature from the 1950s raised concerns about phenothiazine-induced seizures in human patients. For this reason, caution has typically been advised when contemplating acepromazine use in epileptic canine patients, as it was widely believed to lower the seizures threshold. More current studies, however, have failed to show a positive association between use of acepromazine and seizure activity and show a possible role for acepromazine in seizure control: in a retrospective study at University of Tennessee, acepromazine was administered for tranquilization to 36 dogs with a prior history of seizures and to decrease seizure activity in 11 dogs. No seizures were seen within 16 hours of acepromazine administration in the 36 dogs that received the drug, and the seizures abated for 1.5 to 8 hours (n=6) or did not recur (n=2) in eight of 10 dogs that were actively seizing. Excitement-induced seizures were reduced for 2 months in one dog. A second retrospective study also concluded that administration of acepromazine to dogs with prior or acute seizure history did not potentiate seizures, and there was some trend toward seizure reduction. The original seizure cautions reported in the 1950s were in human patients on relatively high doses of the antipsychotic chlorpromazine while the doses of acepromazine used in the two published veterinary studies cited above are much lower. Acepromazine and its major metabolite, hydroxyethylpromazine sulfoxide (aka 2-(1-hydroxyethyl) promazine sulfoxide). In some boxers, acepromazine can cause vasovagal syncope (due to a decreased stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system) and hypotension (due to vasodilation), leading to collapse. This may occur only in certain families of boxers, but the unknown risk to an individual dog means that acepromazine should be used at reduced doses, or not at all, in this breed. Individual dogs of any breed can have a profound reaction characterized by hypotension, especially if there is an underlying heart problem. In giant-breed dogs and sighthounds, the sedative effects of acepromazine may last for 12‚Äì24 hours, which is much longer than the usual 3‚Äì4 hours. Dogs with a mutation in the ABCB1 (MDR1) gene P-glycoprotein (P-gp), also known as multidrug resistant protein 1 (MDR1), is a protein found in cell membranes which is important in the metabolism and excretion of some drugs, such as acepromazine and ivermectin. This protein is encoded by the ABCB1 gene (previously known as the MDR1 gene). A mutation in ABCB1 prevents P-gp from being correctly produced, so that dogs with this mutation have an increased sensitivity to drugs (such as acepromazine) which are substrates of P-gp. Dogs which are heterozygous (that is, which have one functioning ABCB1 gene, and one non-functioning gene) are less sensitive to acepromazine than dogs which are homozygous (that is, which have two copies of the mutant gene). 75% of Collies carry the mutated ABCB1 gene, as do 50% of Australian Shepherds. Other affected breeds include: Border Collie, English Shepherd, German Shepherd, Old English Sheepdog, and Sighthounds, shelties, long haired greyhound. Tests for this mutation are available. Equine In equine surgery, premedication with acepromazine has been shown to reduce the perianaesthetic mortality rate, possibly due to its actions as a sedative and anxiolytic. It is less effective as a sedative if the horse is already excited. Additionally, acepromazine is used as a vasodilator in the treatment of laminitis, where an oral dose equivalent to \\"mild sedation\\" is commonly used, although the dose used is highly dependent on the treating veterinarian. While it is shown to elicit vasodilation in the distal limb, evidence showing its efficacy at increasing perfusion in the laminae is lacking. It is also sometimes used to treat a horse experiencing equine exertional rhabdomyolysis. In the UK, acepromazine is not authorized for use in horses intended for human consumption. Adverse effects Side effects are not common, but the use of acepromazine in stallions should be used with caution (but is not absolutely contraindicated) due to the risk of paraphimosis and priapism. Acepromazine also lowers blood pressure, and should therefore be used with caution in horses that are experiencing anemia, dehydration, shock, or colic. It should not be used in horses dewormed with piperazine.

He opposed the Shah and, after the 1979 Revolution, he first founded the movement of Revolutionary Marxism and in 1983 he co-founded the Communist Party of Iran which was opposed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. In 1991 he separated from this party and founded the Worker-communist Party of Iran (WPI), which he led until his death in 2002. He was the husband of fellow politician Azar Majedi. Life Born in Tehran, Hekmat moved to Shiraz, where he graduated in economics at the University of Shiraz, before moving to the UK where completed his Masters at Bath University. He moved to London in 1973 to start his Phd at Birkbeck University, where he studied under the supervision of Marxist theorist Ben Fine and became a critic of what he saw as distorted versions of communism, including Russian communism, Chinese communism, the guerrilla warfare movement, social democracy Trotskyism and nationalism amongst the left. He founded the Union of Communist Militants in 1979, then took part in the Iranian Revolution of 1979 ‚Äì marked by the creation of workers' councils (shoras) ‚Äì and, unlike the major part of the Iranian left- wing, refused to pay allegiance to Islamism and Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini. He denounced the \\"myth of a progressive national bourgeoisie\\". Hekmat's grave in London's Highgate Cemetery.

Hekmat's Union then fused with a Kurdish group of Maoist roots, Komalah ‚Äì together, they formed the Communist Party of Iran (CPI) based on Revolutionary Marxism. Hekmat and a group of other CPI members left the party and, in 1991, founded the WPI. He also helped establish the Worker-Communist Party of Iraq. He died of cancer in hospital in the UK and his headstone is at Highgate Cemetery, a few meters away from Karl Marx's grave. Views Hekmat supported the \\"return to Marx\\", and theorized that the working class is to rely only on itself - arguing that it had been the only class to impose beneficial changes in the 20th century. He opposed Stalinism and never accepted that either the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China were socialist countries. He famously said \\"The basis of Socialism is the human being\\". Hekmat was also a practicing vegetarian and towards the end of his life became vegan. Hekmat believed in free, legalised abortions but encouraged criticism of the strong feminist movements of his time whom he criticized as having a lack of compassion on this matter. He believed all should be done to create a world in which women are supported socially, economically, culturally and politically to keep their children, to reduce the need for abortions.

Miller Lite competes mainly with Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light and Coors Brewing Company Coors Light. Miller Lite is the official beer sponsor of the Dallas Cowboys, Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Brewers, Milwaukee Bucks, and Bellator MMA, and a primary sponsor of Brad Keselowski's No. 2 Ford Mustang in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. History Miller Lite was the first successful mainstream light beer in the United States market. After its first inception as \\"Gablinger's Diet Beer\\", developed in 1967 by Joseph L. Owades, PhD, a biochemist working for New York's Rheingold Brewery, the recipe was given by Owades to Chicago's Peter Hand Brewing. That year, Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors, renamed Meister Brau Brewing, and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite, a companion to their flagship Meister Brau. Under the new management, Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems, and in 1972, sold several of its existing labels to Miller. The recipe was relaunched simply as \\"Lite\\" on packaging and in advertising (with \\"Lite Beer from Miller\\" being its \\"official\\" name until the late '90s) in the test markets of Springfield, Illinois, Providence, Rhode Island, Knoxville, Tennessee, and San Diego, California, in 1973, and heavily marketed using masculine pro sports players and other, so-called, macho figures of the day in an effort to sell to the key beer-drinking male demographic. Miller Lite was introduced nationally in 1975. Miller's heavy-advertising approach worked where the two previous light beers had failed, and Miller's early production totals of 12.8 million barrels quickly increased to 24.2 million barrels by 1977 as Miller rose to 2nd place in the American brewing marketplace. Other brewers responded, in particular Anheuser-Busch with its heavily advertised Bud Light in 1982, which eventually overtook Lite in sales by 1994. Anheuser- Busch played on the branding style of \\"Lite\\" by highlighting the fact that their beer was called \\"Bud Light\\" as \\"everything else is just a light\\". In 1992, light beers became the biggest domestic beer in America, and in 1998, Miller relabeled its \\"Lite\\" brand as \\"Miller Lite\\". In 2008, Miller Brewing Company test-marketed three new recipes ‚Äì an amber, a blonde ale, and a wheat ‚Äì under the Miller Lite brand, marketed as Miller Lite Brewers Collection.Official Miller Lite Brewers Collection website In December 2013, as part of a product placement marketing campaign with the film Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, Miller reintroduced the 1974 navy-blue blackletter font \\"Lite\\" packaging on its cans for a limited time (the original 1972 cans used a light-blue script logo). However, the vintage packaging was such a success that by September 2014, the company decided to switch back to the vintage packaging full-time, including on bottles and tap handles, mirroring the unexpected success that PepsiCo had in 2009 with its Pepsi Throwback & Mountain Dew Throwback lines in tapping into the retro-themed packaging market. The unexpected sales increase, combined with wanting to differentiate the packaging from Bud Light, were factors in the decision, with some consumers even stating that Miller actually improved on the taste when nothing changed in the beer itself.Miller Lite Brings Back Its White Label, Possibly Also Its Mojo Bloomberg Businessweek (09/02/2014)People Really Think Miller Lite In Vintage-Style Cans Tastes Better Consumerist (09/02/2014) Awards At the 2010 and 2014 Great American Beer Festival, Miller Lite won the gold medal for Best American Style Lager or Light Lager, besting Miller Genuine Draft, which received the. The beer ranked #1 on the list of top 100 beers by the Cold Cans podcast.Cold Cans Advertising The Miller Lite logo, 2003-2014. Miller Lite's long-running \\"Tastes Great!...Less Filling!\\" advertising campaign was ranked by Advertising Age magazine as the eighth best advertising campaign in history. The campaign was developed by the advertising agency McCann-Erickson Worldwide.\\"TOP 100 ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS.\\" Advertising Age. Accessed on July 2, 2006 In the prime of the campaign, television commercials typically portrayed a Lite Beer drinker noting its great taste followed by another who observed that it was less filling. This usually led to a parody of Wild West saloon fights in which every patron got involved in the dispute for no real reason, though in this case it was always a shouting match, and blows were never thrown. The commercials were closed with a voice- over from actor Eddie Barth, who read the slogan, \\"Lite Beer from Miller: Everything you've always wanted in a beer. And less.\\" The then-recently retired New York Jets running back Matt Snell was the first person to appear in Miller Lite's first commercial in 1973. To attract 'Joe Sixpack' to a light beer, these commercials started to feature both elite ex-athletes such as Ray Nitschke, Ben Davidson, and Bubba Smith but also oddball cultural figures such as Mickey Spillane (accompanied by a blonde, Lee Meredith, who is better known for her role as Ulla, the secretary in The Producers), and comedian Rodney Dangerfield. As the series of commercials went on, it began featuring athletes and celebrities of all sorts. Some commercials from this era include: * Former Major League catcher and Milwaukee Brewers broadcaster Bob Uecker being moved from his seat at a ballgame, and escorted away by an usher. Uecker exclaims \\"I must be in the front row,\\" but ends up in the back row of the stands. This gave rise to the term \\"Bob Uecker seats\\".https://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-17/sports/sp-2233_1_bob-uecker *Heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier walking into a full bar as part of a barbershop quartet while the on-screen caption says \\"Joe Frazier, Famous Heavyweight Singer\\". The quartet sings \\"do like Smokin' Joe\\" and the song goes on to praise Miller Lite's advantages.YouTube * Former Baltimore Orioles first baseman Boog Powell and former umpire Jim Honochick doing a spot together, with Honochick unaware who he is standing next to, until he puts his glasses on at the end, and exclaims, \\"Hey - you're Boog Powell!\\" * Footballer and actor Bubba Smith proclaims at the end of a spot, \\"I also like the easy- opening can\\", then tears off the top third of an aluminum Miller Lite can. In a later ad, pro ten-pin bowler Don Carter laments that bowlers are athletes too, and attempts to prove it by repeating Smith's feat, but struggles to do so. * When Billy Martin and George Steinbrenner were in the middle of their 1970s feuds, they did an ad with Martin saying, \\"Tastes great, George\\", and Steinbrenner replying, \\"Less filling, Billy!\\", back and forth until Steinbrenner finally says, \\"You're fired!\\" (changed to \\"You're hired!\\" when Martin was re-hired by Steinbrenner in real life). Martin replies, \\"Not Again!\\" A truck delivering Miller Lite As the popularity of the ads and the number of athletes and celebrities that appeared in them grew, Miller produced occasional \\"alumni\\" ads featuring all of the stars, generally in some sort of competition between the 'Less Fillings' and the 'Taste Greats'. The ads usually ended with Rodney Dangerfield somehow being the goat of the losing team. In one of the last spots to feature Dangerfield, the Miller Lite alumni are competing in a bowling match. It is the last frame of a tie game, and Ben Davidson grumbles to Dangerfield, \\"All we need is one pin, Rodney.\\" Dangerfield rolls the ball down the lane, only to have it bounce horizontally off the head pin and into the gutter, knocking down zero pins. As part of this campaign, Miller Brewing ran a series of television commercials in the winter of 1993-1994 showing several fictitious \\"extreme sports\\" such as \\"Wiener Dog Drag Racing\\" (which featured two wiener dogs racing each other at a drag racing strip), \\"Sumo High Dive\\" (which depicted a Japanese sumo wrestler diving off a platform) and \\"The Miss Perfect Face-Off\\" (which featured beauty pageant contestants playing ice hockey). The tag line that followed was, \\"If you can combine great taste with less filling, you can combine anything.\\" and the question \\"Can your beer do this?\\" In 1995-1996, Miller Lite ran the \\"Life Is Good\\" campaign, which showed Miller Lite drinkers' aspirational transition to more fun via a Miller Lite bottle tap, like \\"Beach Rewind\\", where three men on a beach admired three beautiful women walking by, and could rewind, and enjoy, the scene repeatedly. The campaign was developed by Leo Burnett Company, and received the American Marketing Association EFFIE award for outstanding advertising effectiveness. The campaign included celebrities such as Larry Bird, Keith Jackson, and Richard Karn. Beginning January 12, 1997, a series of surrealistic Miller Lite ads, purportedly made by a man named \\"Dick\\", began to air. They were hallmarked as such either at the beginning or the end of the commercial. The campaign was developed by Minneapolis-based ad agency Fallon. The series of \\"Dick\\" commercials was directed by Gerald Casale of the new wave band Devo. Such commercials include one where a middle-aged man sees the message \\"twist to open\\" on a Miller Lite bottle cap, and he proceeds to do the Twist.\\"See Dick Make Ads\\" . University of Iowa Department of Communication. Accessed on July 2, 2006 Screenshot from the Catfight commercial where a blonde and a brunette fight over whether Miller Lite beer tastes great or is less filling The ad campaign changed back to using high- profile celebrities who were either on opposite ends of the spectrum or had bragging rights to exchange with the other. Notable pairings included the following: * George Brett and Robin Yount. Brett and Yount were both elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 with 98 and 77 percent of the vote respectively while Yount won two MVP awards to Brett's one. * Edgar Winter and George Hamilton. Winter's albinism was a stark contrast to the tanned look of Hamilton on screen. * Ken Stabler and Dan Fouts. Stabler needles Fouts about never getting to or winning a Super Bowl while Fouts lets Stabler know about his inferior passing statistics. In 2002, \\"Catfight\\", another high-profile commercial in the long-running \\"Great Taste...Less Filling\\" campaign, was denounced by critics as depicting women as sexual objects.\\"Miller Lite's 'Catfight' ad angers some viewers.\\" USA Today. Accessed on July 2, 2006 The commercial featured two women, a blonde (Tanya Ballinger) and a brunette (Kitana Baker), discussing the classic \\"Great Taste/Less Filling\\" debate, except they engaged in a catfight, hence the ad's title, with the fight moving from a fountain to a mud pit, with the girls stripping each other of their clothing in the process. An uncensored version of the commercial ended in the muddy beauties, stripped down to their underwear, sharing a passionate kiss. The girls received much publicity from the commercial, and later starred in a few related commercials, videos and events. In 2006, Miller Lite had an advertising campaign called Man Laws featuring celebrities that include actor Burt Reynolds, professional wrestler Triple H, comedian Eddie Griffin, and former American football player Jerome Bettis. The celebrities and other actors were in a \\"Men of the Square Table\\", a group meeting where they discuss different situations that should be included in the \\"Man Laws\\". The ads were developed by the ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky/Miami, and were directed by comedy film director Peter Farrelly.Miller Lite \\"Unopened Beer\\". AdWeek. Accessed on July 2, 2006 In June 2010, commercials premiered featuring actresses Lindsey McKeon and Nadine Heimann as bartenders. In 2020, the Venice, California based podcast known as Dirty Sports was sponsored by the Miller Lite brand. This move is an illustration of larger brands moving into the podcast sphere. Motorsport sponsorship The Miller Lite car in 2012. The car's current driver, Brad Keselowski, won the Sprint Cup Series title that same year. Miller Brewing Company began their NASCAR sponsorship in 1983 with driver Bobby Allison, advertising the Miller High Life brand and later in 1990 with driver Rusty Wallace, advertising the Miller Genuine Draft brand. In 1997, the company began advertising the Miller Lite brand on Wallace's #2 Penske Racing car. The car later earned the nickname \\"Blue Deuce\\", due to its number and blue paint scheme. Wallace retired following the 2005 season, and Kurt Busch was named as his replacement. Busch drove the \\"Blue Deuce\\" from 2006 to 2010. The car is currently driven by Brad Keselowski, who won the 2012 Sprint Cup Series championship. Other promotion in motorsport included the sponsoring of Don Prudhomme's Larry Dixon-driven NHRA top fuel dragster from 1997 to 2007. Prior to that, Dixon was sponsored by Miller Genuine Draft. Additionally, Miller Brewing sponsored the Unlimited hydroplane of R.B. \\"Bob\\" Taylor in 1984 with the U-7 \\"Lite All-Star\\", driven by Tom D'Eath. The following year, Miller switched teams and brands with the \\"Miller American\\" Unlimited hydroplane owned by Fran Muncey and Jim Lucero‚Äîwhich resulted in the 1985 National Championship, and APBA Gold Cup wins in 1985, 1986, and 1987, driven by Chip Hanauer.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1995, and a cabinet minister in the NDP government of Premier Howard Pawley from 1982 to 1988. The son of Hans W. Plohman and Anne Werstiuk, he was educated at the University of Manitoba, University of Winnipeg, and Red River Community College. He worked as a teacher before entering public life. In 1980, he was elected a municipal councillor in the town of Dauphin. Plohman was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1981 as a New Democrat, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Jim Galbraith by 636 votes in the central-northern riding of Dauphin. He entered cabinet on August 20, 1982, serving as Minister of Government Services with responsibility for the Manitoba Telephone Act. Following a cabinet shuffle on November 4, 1983, he became Minister of Highways and Transportation. On January 30, 1985, he was also named Minister of Government Services. Plohman was re-elected by an increased margin in the 1986 provincial election. He relinquished the Government Services portfolio on February 4, 1987, and on September 21, 1987 he left the Highways and Transportation portfolio to accept the position of Minister of Natural Resources. The Manitoba NDP were defeated in parliament in early 1988, when disgruntled backbench Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Jim Walding voted against his government's budget. Despite this Plohman was re-elected in the following election, defeating Progressive Conservative Russell Secord by 548 votes. The NDP were reduced to 12 seats (out of 57) and third-party status following this election; Plohman formally resigned his cabinet portfolio on May 9 when the new government was sworn into office. The NDP recovered to twenty seats in the provincial election of 1990, and Plohman was re-elected with an increased majority. He did not seek re-election in 1995 and returned to the teaching profession from which he retired in 2003. In 2002, Plohman was appointed to a provincial advisory board recommending ways to stimulate economic growth at the Port of Churchill, in northern Manitoba. In 2004 he was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Churchill Gateway Development Corporation. In 2005, Plohman was appointed as the first Chairman of the Board of the newly formed Manitoba Agriculture Services Corporation (MASC). In this capacity Plohman provided leadership in the amalgamation of the former Manitoba Agriculture Credit Corporation (MACC) and the Manitoba Crop Insurance Corporation (MCIC) into the dynamic MASC serving the lending and insurance needs of rural Manitobans. In 2014 Plohman was appointed to the Government of Manitoba's Crown Corporations Council as a Director from which he resigned on May 25, 2016. John Plohman married the former Patricia Ann Yanke in 1971 and they have three children, Rychelle Anne Plohman Lytle, Dr. Jodi Lynn Plohman Jones and Robert James Plohman CA.

Because of this, Bishweshwar began to study at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta as per his father's wishes. Towards the end of 1930, he left college and returned to Banaras. In 1932, he completed his intermediate level of studies. His father again insisted that his son join Scottish Church College in Calcutta. So for the second time, he joined the college, but left it soon afterwards. In 1934, he completed his bachelor's degree in Economics and Politics from Banaras Hindu University. He also earned a degree in Law from the University of Calcutta in 1937, and practised for several years in Darjeeling. While still a student, he became involved in the Indian nationalist movement. In 1934, he joined the Indian National Congress. During World War II, he was interned by the British in Dhanbad for two years (1942‚Äì1944). Political career Home Minister B. P. Koirala in Delhi 1951 Following his release, with Indian independence imminent, he set about trying to bring change to Nepal. In 1947 he founded from India the socialist Nepali National Congress, which in 1950 became the Nepali Congress Party. On 9 March 1947, Koirala crossed over to Nepal for helping brother Girija Prasad Koirala instigate the Biratnagar jute mill strike. He was arrested along with Girija Prasad Koirala and four other National Congress leaders and taken with his fellow agitators to Kathmandu via a 21 days long, slow walk across the hills. The prisoners' march attracted much attention and helped to radicalise the peasants whose villages lay en route. The Koirala along with other detainees were kept in Kathmandu bungalow but were soon released after a 27-day hunger strike, popular protests, and at the request of Mahatma Gandhi in August 1947 Koirala went back to India, and began looking for arms to storm Kathmandu. Finally, Koirala led the Revolution of 1951, which overthrew Nepal's 104-year- old Rana regime. The last Rana prime minister was dismissed in October 1951 when the Rana-Congress coalition cabinet (in which Koirala served for nine months as the Home minister) broke apart. Koirala then concentrated on developing the Nepali political structure. King Mahendra responded with a new constitution enabling free parliamentary elections to take place in 1959. Only a fragmented parliament was expected, but Koirala's Nepali Congress scored a landslide, taking more than two-thirds of the seats in the lower house. After several weeks of significant hesitation, Mahendra asked Koirala to form a government, which took office in May 1959. Koirala led his country's delegation to the United Nations and made carefully poised visits to China and India, then increasingly at odds over territorial disputes. Yet, he was in trouble at home almost from the beginning. His land reform measures, especially the revision of the tenancy laws so easily passed by parliament, deeply offended the landed aristocracy which had long dominated the army. King Mahendra, on 15 December 1960, suspended the constitution, dissolved parliament, dismissed the cabinet, imposed direct rule, and for good measure imprisoned Koirala and his closest government colleagues. Many of them were released after few months, but Koirala, though he was suffering from throat cancer, was kept imprisoned without trial until 1968. In 1968, the then Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, played a significant role in releasing Koirala from prison, but he was the main actor for also making sure that Koirala stays out of the country in self-exile for the rest of his life. Koirala was in self-exile in Banaras, India until December 1977. After his return from almost a decade of self exile in Banaras, he was kept under house arrest in his Chabahil residence. During that time, King Birendra asked the then Prime Minister Dr Tulsi Giri, a tough political rival of Koirala to recommend him by the joint meeting of the Council of Ministers and Back to the Village National Campaign Central Committee, whether Koirala should be freed for medical treatment in the USA or not. Accordingly, the joint meeting recommended King Birendra to release Koirala and provide him with necessary expenses to undertake the medical treatment in the USA. The passport and necessary visa were arranged by the government of Nepal for Koirala and his wife Sushila Koirala, a doctor and an assistance. The then Royal Nepalese Embassy in the Washington DC, was instructed to provide all support to Koirala family for the medical treatment.A commentary prepared by Bhola Chatterjee, a close friend of B. P. Koirala and renowned Indian journalist from Kolkata, India King Birendra, educated in England and the United States, succeeded his father in 1972 when the political climate was believed to be gradually improving. Koirala, however, was arrested immediately upon his return from exile in 1976 and charged with the capital offence of attempting armed revolution. Finally, in March 1978, he was cleared of all treason and sedition charges. Then, in 1981, he was cleared to travel to the United States for medical treatment. The Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa convinced the king to allow Koirala to proceed to the US for treatment as per recommendation from the royal physician Dr. M. R. Pandey. The government of Nepal bore a portion of the cost of his medical treatment in the US, while the rest was arranged by his nephew Shail Updhaya, Dr. Shukdev Shah, family and friends. After returning from a further medical visit to the United States, he had a series of audiences with King Birendra, as he tried for a \\"national reconciliation\\". During the student demonstrations in 1979, he was under house arrest. However, he welcomed King Birendra's call for a national referendum on the question of the political system for Nepal. The referendum results were announced to be in favour of retaining the political system led by the B. P. Koirala was the first leader to welcome the result of the national referendum and accepted the people verdict and claimed that the referendum was fair and free. However, owing to differences in the electoral process to seek membership of class organization as mandatory, Koirala demanded a boycott of the 1981 elections. Despite obviously failing health and political strength, Koirala could still draw a great popular support. He addressed one of Nepal's largest public meetings in recent years in Kathmandu's Ratna Park in January 1982. He died on 21 July 1982, in Kathmandu. An estimated half a million people attended his funeral. Literature Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala While Koirala is considered one of the most charismatic political leader of Nepal, he was also one of the most well-read and thoughtful writers of Nepalese literature. He wrote short stories and novels, and some poems. Koirala began writing short stories in Hindi. His first stories were published in Banaras in Hansa, a Hindi literary magazine edited by Prem Chand (India's Tolstoy). His first Nepali short story \\"Chandrabadan\\" was published in Sharada, a Nepali literary magazine in 1935. Koirala was very good at depicting the character and mind of women. Four other stories of Koirala were included in Katha Kusum (an anthology of Nepali stories), published in 1938 in Darjeeling. As a social realist, with good psychological insight as he was first writer to write stories and novels based on human psychology in history of Nepalese literature, Koirala had established himself as one of the most important Nepali short story writers by 1938. Doshi Chashma [Guilty Glasses], Koirala's anthology of sixteen short stories, was published in 1949. He was one of the greatest writer to contribute to the Nepali literature. Koirala was very busy in the 1950s as he was often found amidst the political situations of Nepal. He was, however, able to write an incomplete novel Hitlar ra Yahudi (Hitler and the Jews) in the form of travelogue. The 1960s were very productive for Koirala in terms of his literary output. He wrote many novels and short stories in jail during 1960‚Äì68. They include: Tin Ghumti (Three Turns), 1968; Narendra Dai (Brother Narendra), 1969; Sumnima (A story of the first Kirata woman), 1969; Modiain (The Grocer's Wife), 1980; Shweta Bhairavi (The White Goddess of Terror), 1983; Babu Ama ra chora (Father, mother and sons), 1989; and an incomplete autobiography Mero Katha (My Story), 1983, and many more yet to be published. Koirala also has dozens of political essays including the following: \\"Rajatantra ra Lokatantra\\" (\\"Monarchy and Democracy\\"), 1960; \\"Thichieka Janata Jagisake\\" (\\"The Oppressed People Rise\\"), 1969; \\"Rastriyata Nepalko Sandarbhama\\" (\\"Nationalism in the Context of Nepal\\"), 1970; \\"Kranti: Ek Anivaryata\\" (\\"Revolution: An Absolute Necessity\\"), 1970; \\"Panchayati Vyavastha Prajatantrik Chaina\\" (\\"The Panchayat System is not Democratic\\"), 1978; \\"Prajatantra ra Samajvad\\" (\\"Democracy and Socialism\\"), 1979; and \\"Rastriya Ekata ko Nimti Ahwan\\" (\\"A Call for National Reconciliation\\"), 1980. Koirala's writings (both political and literary) were banned until recently. Nepalese youths spent several years of imprisonment just on the charges of possessing Koirala's writings. Another problem is that his rare and important writings have been scattered all over. Old newspapers and magazines (including the underground publications) have to be researched. Libraries, museums, and archives in Kathmandu, Banaras, Calcutta, New Delhi, London, Paris, Berkeley, Stanford, and many other places have to be visited to collect the materials on Koirala. As a result, one can hope to produce volumes of his political writings and literary works. Koirala was the focus of Nepalese politics during the 1950s, 1960s, and the 1970s. Even today, long after his death, people of Nepal feel that the restoration of multi-party democracy is a tribute to him. Koirala was also one of the most important literary figures of Nepal. In politics Koirala was a social democrat; in literature he was an existentialist especially in his novel Tin Ghumti (Three Turns). He said that he wrote his literary works to satisfy his anarchist impulses, impulses which revolted against the traditional order of things. But as a social democrat he was in search of a political order that was agreeable to every citizen of Nepal. As a politician, Koirala struggled throughout his life for the establishment of a multi-party democracy in his country. Traditional forces, still strong to resist such effort, made it very hard for \\"B. P.\\" to accomplish his political mission. As a social democrat, Koirala differed with communists; as he often said man cannot live by bread alone. He also differed with the capitalists as he thought that unbridled consumerism was immoral, and that the appalling exploitation of the world's resources was short-sighted and unrealistic. He believed that only socialism could guarantee political freedom and equal economic opportunities to the people. He said, \\"socialism is the wave of the future.\\" Koirala had studied economics, logic, literature, and law. He was a voracious reader of English, German, French, Russian, Hindi, Bengali and Nepali literature. His educational background and artistic abilities were combined in his own works to present a view of life in an artistic, logical and compelling manner. He would thus shake the conscience of Nepali readers by questioning their unreflective acceptance of the traditional value systems. Koirala's short stories were first published in the 1930s in Hindi and Nepali literary magazines. Koirala first came to notice in Nepali literature because often his characters seemed to have been treated with an understanding of Freudian psychoanalysis. Even when a short story or novel of Koirala was not Freudian in its approach, it was still noteworthy to Nepali readers because he presented an unconventional approach to life. Modiain (The Grocer's wife) is probably his shortest novel. In Modiain Koirala looks at the Mahabharata war from the point of view of a young woman who loses her husband to the war. This woman was not alone. There were hundreds of thousands of young women who were widowed by the war. Thus, Koirala presents a passionate plea against the philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita, which assumes that the world is but an illusion and thus makes life and death a meaningless phenomena and that the observance of one's own duty is the ultimate priority. Koirala was against war, and by looking at the Vedanta philosophy and the issue of war from a war widow's point of view, he once again shakes the conscience of the Nepali readers who generally tend to accept the philosophy of Vedanta especially its idea of karma (fate). Characteristically, Koirala presents one more instance in which he analyses the mind of a woman, as he did in most of his short stories and novels. Legacy The following institutions have been set up in his memory: #In 1992, the B. P. Koirala Nepal Health Foundation was inaugurated by the prime ministers of India and Nepal with the objective of supplementing the normal cooperation and interaction at the Government-to- Government level by providing statesmen, media persons, etc. to constantly nurture and further enhance the understanding and friendship between two countries. The trust is a symbol of Nepali renaissance #In 1992, the Government of Nepal has established the B. P. Koirala Memorial Planetarium, Observatory and Science Museum Development Board in 1992 in order to establish Planetaria, Observatories and Science Museums in Nepal & conduct research activities in the area of Astronomy, Astrophysics and Cosmology #B. P. Koirala Memorial Trust (B. P. Trust) was established in 2000 in memory of the late B. P. Koirala. It is the only legal institution approved by the government of Nepal to collect royalties, claim copyrights and allow legal permission regarding B. P. Koirala. B. P. Trust receives financial support from the government. The establishment of this Trust in B. P. Koirala's memory can be considered as a remarkable achievement. Also, various programs are organized in Nepal as well as outside Nepal to remember his selfless contributions to Nepal.

It is in the parish of Overchurch and administratively, the village is a ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. Upton is in the traditional county of Cheshire. At the 2011 census, the population was 16,130. Upton was originally settled as an Anglo-Saxon farming community, and remained as a farming community until the village's rapid urbanisation and expansion from the mid-19th century. This was brought about by the development of Liverpool as a major port, with rail and road links across the Mersey estuary. The village now has a strong service economy which is based primarily around healthcare and retail, with a variety of places nearby, and within the village, to pursue sport and leisure activities. History Etymology The name Upton is from the Old English upp, meaning up, high or a hill, and t≈´n, meaning a farmstead or settlement. Upton therefore could be explained as meaning Hill Farm. This is still recognisable today, as Upton is on a low hill. As the name Upton is relatively common, it was sometimes known historically as Upton in Wyrhale (in 1307) or Upton by Birkenhead. The name Overchurch may translate as \\"shore church\\", from the Old English ofer meaning a shore and cirice, a church. This implies that, during the Anglo-Saxon era, the shoreline of the Irish Sea was much closer to the centre of the village. Ownership of the manor Upton was originally settled as a farming community, during the Anglo-Saxon period. In Norman times, Upton was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Optone and was written as being in the possession of William Malbank. The manor passed to the Orrebies under the family of Praers, and then through the Arderne family, and by marriage to Baldwin of Bold in 1310. His descendants owned the manor for six generations, before it was sold in 1614. Subsequent owners have included the Earls of Derby. Notably, as a likely consequence of the 8th Earl of Derby who lived at nearby Bidston Hall. From Elizabethan times, the manor was associated with Upton Hall, which passed hands along with the manor. Upton Hall was sold by the Webster family to the Society of the Faithful Companions of Jesus (FCJ) who turned it into a school (currently Upton Hall School FCJ). Early modern Upton Manor. Upton was the primary economic centre of northern Wirral until the industrial development of Birkenhead during the mid-19th century. Five important local roads converged on the village, and its main thoroughfare was the place of a weekly market, recorded as being held from 1662. Fairs were also held in the village at Michaelmas and Easter. When the original parish church at Overchurch was pulled down in 1813, a runestone, attributed to the 7th or 8th centuries, was discovered in the ruins. It has been interpreted as a memorial to √Üthelmund, perhaps a local leader or missionary. The stone is now kept at the Grosvenor Museum in Chester. > \\"..though now only a small village, Upton was formerly considered the > metropolis of the lower mediety of Wirral, and had two annual fairs of > considerable importance, and also a weekly market that was discontinued in > 1620, the village having been recently almost entirely rebuilt, contains > several good houses, among which may be particularly mentioned Upton Hall > ...\\" > > ‚Äîsaid of Upton in the History of the Hundred of Wirral by William Williams > Mortimer, 1847. A major contributor to the village was William Inman, owner of the Inman Line, who donated money for the construction of St. Mary's Church. Inman resided at Upton Manor, within the grounds of Upton Park. Both Upton Manor and St. Mary's Church were designed by John Cunningham. Few buildings remain in Upton from before the mid-19th Century. Two notable examples are the Stone House at the top of the village, on Ford Road, and the Old Smithy on Rake Lane. These buildings are both built of local red sandstone, hewn into large blocks. They are both of similar material and style to many old buildings which are found throughout Cheshire and Lancashire farming communities. Neither of these buildings is designated as a listed building. World War II Just prior to World War II, the War Department requisitioned a large amount of land to the northern side of Arrowe Farm, next to the Police station. This was used for military weapons storage. The camp was known as 64 Anti-Aircraft Ordnance Depot. The site had three reinforced bunkers for storage of ordnance, in the area which is now occupied by the Sainsbury's building. The site eventually came into the use of the Territorial Army and part of the area is currently in use by army and air force cadets. During this period, RAF West Kirby was also situated just under west the centre of the village, along Saughall Massie Road, and backed on to Larton. Civic history Upton was a township in the ancient parish of Overchurch in the Wirral Hundred, which became a civil parish in 1866. Between 1894 and 1933 Upton was administered as part of Wirral Rural District. The civil parish was disbanded on 1 April 1933 and absorbed into the county boroughs of Birkenhead and Wallasey. On 1 April 1974, local government reorganisation in England and Wales resulted in most of the Wirral Peninsula, including Upton, transfer from the county of Cheshire to the newly created county of Merseyside. Geography, geology and environment Upton lies at the geographic centre of the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, from the Irish Sea at Leasowe Lighthouse, north-east of the Dee Estuary and a similar distance south-west of the River Mersey. Upton sits on a low-lying hill, in a wide and shallow glacial U-shaped valley, formed during the Quaternary Ice Age, between Bidston Hill and Thurstaston Hill. The underlying bedrock is Triassic bunter sandstone of the Helsby Sandstone Formation and the Sidmouth Mudstone Formation. This is overlain with boulder clay from the Quaternary Ice Age, similar to the nearby Dee Cliffs, and clay soil. The bedrock is not usually visible, as it is on the nearby Bidston Hill. The highest point in Upton is above sea level, just off the junction with the A551 and the B5139, at Moreton Road, in the centre of the village. A further prominence of above sea level is at Upton Manor, from the centre of the village. Most of the populated area is more than above sea level, and most of the ground is on a gentle hillside. Consequently, Upton has avoided the significant flooding which can happen in the nearby low-lying Fender valley. Due to its inland location and elevation Upton is not prone to coastal flooding, which can happen at West Kirby, Hoylake, Meols and New Brighton. Upton is bounded by Arrowe Brook, at Upton Meadow, and the River Fender which is alongside the M53 motorway. Both are tributaries of the Birket, which discharges into West Float and then into the River Mersey. Upton Meadow Millennium Wood Upton Meadow Millennium Wood is an ancient, semi-natural woodland, a community forest and a county wildlife site which has informal public access. The area has of footpaths and a bridleway along the western boundary. The area is one of the last remaining unbuilt, natural areas in Upton. Parts of the site were planted in 1997 and the site was leased to the Woodland Trust on a 99-year lease, from Wirral Borough Council, in the same year. The woodland contains a mixture of species such as oak, ash, hazel, birch, blackthorn and hawthorn. Additional plantations by the local council, in 1980, have also included maple, grey alder, grey willow and guelder rose. Other plants include holly, English elm and sycamore. The area has a pond which contains a good population of invertebrates and some amphibians, with a significant colony of common toad. The meadow is and the habitat is rare, within the local area. Climate Upton has a temperate maritime climate (K√∂ppen: Cfb), similar to much of the rest of the United Kingdom. Being close to the sea and sheltered from the prevailing south-westerly wind by Snowdonia, the area has relatively warm summers. The winters are generally mild and wet, mornings with light frost are common, and there are few days of snow. The nearest official weather station, as the crow flies, is at Hall Road in Crosby, which is about away. * The earliest sunrise is on 18 June, at 4.43am. Meanwhile, the latest sunrise is on 1 January, at 8.28am. * The earliest sunset is on 14 December, at 3.53pm. Whilst the latest sunset is on 24 June, at 9.45pm. * The Winter Solstice has 7h 29m 05s of daylight, and the Summer Solstice has 17h 01m 10s of daylight. Complete darkness occurs for about three hours a night, during midsummer, with about two hours of twilight either side. Demography The population, by age, at the 2011 census. The population was 141 in 1801, 227 in 1851, 622 in 1889 and 788 in 1901. At the 2001 census, the population was recorded as 15,731 (7,268 males, 8,463 females). At the 2011 census, the population had increased to 16,130 (7,529 males, 8,601 females). Key Statistics (Source: 2011 census) In 2011 there were 31.7 persons per hectare and 7,127 occupied households in Upton. 17.2% of people aged 16 or older have five or more grade A-C GCSEs or equivalent. This figure is higher than England as a whole. Whilst 29.2% have no formal qualifications, which is a figure that is also higher than England as a whole. Of the adult population, aged between 16 and 74 years of age, 34.7% of people are economically inactive, whilst 5.4% are economically active, but unemployed. This gives a combined non-employment rate of 40.1% of the adult population. 59.9% of adults are, therefore, occupied with work, training or education, in one form or another. 95.3% of the population is White British, with the remainder being of other ethnicities. With regards to religion, are that 73.4% of people are Christian, 18.7% of people have no religion and 6.7% of people did not state their religion, with the remaining 1.2% of people have other religions. Governance The village is part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. It is also within the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. The current member of parliament is Margaret Greenwood, a Labour MP who is the fourth representative for the constituency. The previous incumbent of the post, the third representative for the constituency, was Esther McVey, a Conservative politician who was MP from 2010 until 2015. The second representative, Stephen Hesford, who was a Labour MP and had a constituency office in the village. He was MP from 1997 until 2010.

Earlier MPs have included Selwyn Lloyd, a former Foreign Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Speaker of the House of Commons, as well as William Lever, the founder of Lever Brothers. The area is also a local government ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. Upton is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by three councillors. These are Jean Robinson, Tony Smith and Stuart Whittingham, who are all Labour councillors. The most recent local elections took place on 2 May 2019. Economy The major employment sectors, in Upton, are healthcare and retail. The major employer is the Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust at Arrowe Park Hospital. Other significant employers include J Sainsbury PLC, Homebase, Argos, McDonald's and the Royal Mail. The Village The village had a branch of one of the United Kingdom's major banks, Barclays Bank, in a building formerly occupied by Martins Bank. The Post Office also operates banking services. Other banks and building societies have operated in the village include NatWest, the Midland Bank (which was latterly HSBC), the Abbey National, Birmingham Midshires, Lloyds Bank and TSB. The village has newsagents, food retailers including a branch of Domino's Pizza, three restaurants, which provide Mediterranean, Kerala and Balti cuisine, a cafe and an award-winning fish and chip shop.

Lipton's used to have a supermarket in the village, in the building which is now used as the fitness centre. Spar has also operated a supermarket in the village, firstly following Lipton's in the same building, and then at the bottom of Arrowe Park Road. Clarks has previously had a shoe shop, in the building currently used by Ladbrokes. Wirral Business Park A former major employer was the Champion spark plug factory on Arrowebrook Road. The factory was opened in 1968. At its peak, the business employed over 1,000 people in Upton. The factory was closed in 2006 with production transferred to Italy. After the business withdrew from the area, the buildings were allowed to remain and the site is now operated as the Wirral Business Park and, informally, as the Champion's Business Park. The site is now primarily intended for the use of small businesses which need a significant degree of indoor space. Vacant space, at the business park, has been utilised quite rapidly, since the closure of the Champion's business. Businesses, at the site, now include a furniture retailer, a recording studio and rehearsal room, a hydroponics store and a self-storage facility amongst others. Upton Retail Park Upton Retail Park is a small retail park which was developed in the early 1990s. The development was built on of Upton Meadow, adjacent to Arrowe Park Road and Upton Bypass. There was local protest to the new development on a green space. The original businesses to open on the site were J Sainsbury PLC and Homebase, which still operate. McDonald's opened shortly after the retail park was opened to the public, and Argos opened around 2010. Other shops Other small shopping areas are located on Royden Road and along Manor Drive, the latter having a branch of The Co- operative Food. Services The care home on Salacre Lane. Arrowe Park Hospital is barely a mile from the centre of the village, and includes an Accident and Emergency department. Upton is served by Upton Group Practice, a dentist and two opticians. Pharmacies in the village include Boots Pharmacy and Numark, as well as further pharmacies at Upton Group Practice and Arrowe Park Hospital. Upton is also served by several residential, care and nursing homes, one of which is situated at Upton Manor and another on Ford Road, as well as a recently built care home on Salacre Lane. Upton has its own Police station, which is a branch of Merseyside Police, and a Fire station which is a branch of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, as well as an ambulance station, operated by the North West Ambulance Service, at the nearby Arrowe Park Hospital. The village has a Jobcentre Plus, as well as a postal sorting office. There is also a driving test centre on Arrowe Park Road and two MOT test centres, one of which is on Manor Drive and the other being on Arrowe Park Road, next to the fire station. There are two petrol stations in the village, these being operated by Shell, which is a 24-hour business, as well as Sainsbury's. Both of these are situated next to Upton Bypass at Arrowe Park Road. Meanwhile, the Arrowebrook telephone exchange is situated on Church Road and serves approximately 25,000 residential premises and 686 non-residential premises. The exchange is operated by BT. This provides ADSL and SDSL services, among others. The village once had several toll houses, only one of which now remains. The toll houses were used by passing travellers, during the 19th century, to pay for use of the turnpike. These were situated at the junction of Saughall Massie Lane and Old Greasby Road, at the top of Moreton Road, and the Arrowe Park Road junction with Arrowe Brook Road. This final toll house is the only surviving example.  Community  Schools Upton Hall School. Upton has a number of schools. These include Overchurch Primary School and St. Joseph's Primary School, which are both on Moreton Road, and Hayfield School on Manor Drive. These all cater for children between the ages of four and eleven. Overchurch Primary School is separated into two parts. These are Overchurch Infants' School, which is for children between the ages of 4 to 8 years, and Overchurch Junior School, which is for children from 9 to 11 years old. Upton Hall School FCJ, a grammar school for girls, is situated near to the centre of the village, with entrances on Moreton Road and Saughall Massie Lane. The original school in Upton was situated on Rake Lane, before moving to the building which is now part of St. Mary's church hall, and then onto Overchurch Primary School. The original school building still stands in Rake Lane and was used as a church hall for teenagers, prior to the opening of \\"The Bank\\". Other former schools include St. Benedict's High School which has now been closed and demolished, as well as Kingsley Nursery School, which suffered a similar fate. Upton is also home to Wirral's only bilingual day nursery, Hablahttps://habladaynursery.co.uk/ which caters for children aged 6 months to 5 years. Churches St. Mary's Church. Holmleigh, Church Road. St. Mary's Church is Upton's Church of England parish church. This is a large church, which was consecrated on 28 April 1868. The church had its own office and meeting room, situated in Holmleigh, which was next door to the church hall, on Church Road. Holmleigh was originally built by William Inman, for his estate bailiff, in 1869. The building was given to the church, in 1884, by another owner and became the vicarage in 1911. A new vicarage was built in 1928, further down Church Road, and the building was sold. However, the church repurchased Holmleigh in 1985, when the building acquired its present use. St. Mary's Church replaced Holmleigh and the church hall, with modern housing. This led to some opposition to the proposal. St. Joseph's Church, the local Roman Catholic parish church, was opened on 31 August 1954. Upton's United Reformed Church was opened on 11 May 1900, with the final service held on 26 July 2015. Former Churches and Religious Buildings The original Norman church was a steepled church, of decorative design, and was situated opposite Upton Manor on Moreton Road. The earliest reference to the church is in 1347. The steeple was damaged by a storm in 1709 and, by 1813, the church was in such poor condition that it was petitioned to be demolished. The church is understood to have been built on the site of at least one previous Saxon church. The 1837 tithe map of the area indicates a half-circle of standing stones, around a wooded hollow which was situated next to the church, at a diameter of . Although much detail is lost to history, this has raised the possibility that the site was once a stone circle and, therefore, a pre- Christian, Neolithic religious site. Greenbank Church was built in 1813 and was situated closer to the centre of the village, next to Greasby Road. This church reused material from the former Norman church, though was of much simpler design. This church was used until the construction of St. Mary's and was later demolished. During which time, the Overchurch runic stone was discovered. The priory was originally known as The Parsonage. This building was situated on Ford Road, was constructed before 1850, and was used as the vicarage until 1911. The building was quite large, with seven bedrooms. The building no longer stands, having been demolished in the 1950s. However, the wall and the walled-in gateway still remain, on Ford Road. Leisure Upton Library. Victory Hall, a community hall rebuilt in 1963, was originally sited in a large Victorian villa, which had been purchased by public subscription. Upton Library was opened in 1936 and built in the Art Deco style of architecture. The village's war memorial is located within its grounds. The Village Youth Project, known as The Bank, is a youth club set up in 1999. This provides a range of activities for the youth of Upton. The club runs various events for the community, including a popular annual fair, situated at Overchurch Primary School each summer. The club also organises many residential visits to various parts of the United Kingdom. Overchurch Upton Scout Group was formed in 1924, and is situated on Salacre Lane. The site of the scout hut was acquired after the 3rd World Scout Jamboree, held less than a mile away, in Arrowe Park, in 1929. Public Houses The Eagle and Crown. The village has two public houses and a new micropub, which are close to the centre. These are the Bow-Legged Beagle, which open in December 2018, Eagle and Crown, built around 1840, and the Horse and Jockey. Built around 1850, the Horse and Jockey used to be situated opposite the Eagle and Crown and was owned by William Inman until 1875. The old Horse and Jockey building was demolished in the 1960s, before moving to new premises nearby. Meanwhile, the Overchurch Hotel and the Stirrup are situated away from the centre of the village. Upton also used to have a beer house known as The Traveller's Rest. This beer house closed in 1903, although the building remains. Parks and Commons Upton has a number of parks and commons, the largest of which is Arrowe Park, which is less than a mile from the centre of the village. This park is also home to Arrowe Park Hospital and was the location of the 3rd World Scout Jamboree, in 1929. The park is used, weekly, by amateur football teams playing against the Arrowe Park Blades FC and for the Wirral Radio Control Flying Society. Upton Park is the second largest park in the area. This park is situated near to Upton Manor and next to the M53 motorway, on the border with Moreton. The park used to have a racecourse and was part of the property of Upton Manor. This park has an annual firework display, which is free, on Guy Fawkes Night. Warwick Park is a small suburban park with an area of and which is situated in Overchurch. This park has its own group of friends. The park was originally known as Warwick Hay. Overchurch Park is situated nearby to Warwick Park, and includes the site of the old Norman Church and graveyard, which have been scheduled as monuments by English Heritage. Upton Meadow is a public common with a semi-natural woodland and of footpaths. This area is bordered by Arrowe Brook and separates Upton from Greasby. Meanwhile, Salacre Common is also a public common, but somewhat smaller. Salacre common was originally the front garden of a large house and is the closest green space to the centre of the village. Sport Victory Hall. The village is represented in sport by Upton Cricket Club, which was established in 1901 by William Hannay, following a lease of land from Lord Leverhulme. The cricket club originally had its own tennis and football clubs. However, the tennis club had folded, on this site, by 1968. Upton Victory Hall Lawn Tennis & Badminton Club was established in 1919, and was situated behind a large house on the corner of Salacre Lane, known as \\"The Elms\\". The Elms building was sold in 1963, and Victory Hall was built behind the house, before the house was demolished. The tennis club has four grass courts and four AstroTurf courts. The clubhouse is a separate building from Victory Hall, and has its own bar, function room and an entrance on Rake Lane. The sports club also provides facilities for croquet and bowls. In football, Upton FC was founded in 1994, and has teams for both boys and girls of all abilities and ages from six onwards. Upton Park is an area of recreational open space and woodland. The park was part of William Inman's Upton Manor estate and had included a racecourse between 1922 and 1924. Part of the Upton Park site is now the Moreton Spur road, connected to the M53 motorway. Transport Roads The B5139, Old Greasby Road, heading towards Upton village. Upton today is most notable for its central location between Birkenhead and West Kirby. The consequence of this is that road transport through Upton is uncharacteristically efficient for the rural suburban area of Wirral. Upton is situated at the junction of roads from Birkenhead, Moreton (the A551), Greasby (the B5139), Saughall Massie and Arrowe Park (the A551). The road network was further enhanced with the building of a bypass (the A5027) in the early 1980s. The M53 motorway, at Junction 2, is situated less than a mile from the centre of the village and connects directly to the bypass. Buses The first bus to run from Upton village was a horse-drawn bus, in 1891. This bus operated to Claughton Village. Whilst the first motorised Birkenhead Corporation bus worked on 14 July 1920. Until deregulation of the bus services, in 1986, Upton was served by both the forerunner to Merseytravel, the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (MPTE) and the separate operator, Crosville. Present-day services are run primarily by Arriva, and are coordinated by Merseytravel. The village has bus stops along all four of the main roads entering the village. Merseytravel's daily \\"Saveaway\\" Area B and All Zones tickets are valid to use from any bus stop in Upton, on the basis of being for the passenger of relevant age, in-date and for use after 9:30am. Railways Upton is not part of the major electrified Merseyrail Wirral line from Birkenhead to West Kirby, which instead passes around the more densely populated coast. Upton railway station exists as part of the Borderlands line between Bidston and Wrexham and is operated by Transport for Wales, with a diesel service. However, the station is within the Merseytravel area. Journeys can be made from the station with a daily \\"Saveaway\\" ticket. This is a reasonably priced ticket, and allows unlimited travel within the Merseytravel area, for one day, as far afield as Chester, Southport, Ormskirk and Newton-le-Willows, as well as Birkenhead and Liverpool. Though, due to its location, the station is more of service to the Noctorum community, rather than Upton. This is not considered a problem however, as the locality is well served by regular bus services. Cycling National Cycle Route 56 passes along the eastern side of the village. This route goes from Chester to Liverpool via Leasowe and Seacombe and includes part of the Wirral Way, along its course. Notable people The most notable person that lived in Upton was William Inman, who was the owner of the Inman Line of ships which operated from Liverpool to New York. Whilst the most notable person to have an association with Upton is Dixie Dean, the professional footballer who holds the league record for the most goals scored in one season. Dixie Dean worked in Upton as a delivery boy. Athlete Andrew Baddeley, who is an English middle distance runner who competed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics, was born in Upton. Danny Harrison, an English footballer who previously played for both Tranmere Rovers and Chester, has also lived in Upton. BBC journalist Sally Nugent was educated at Upton Hall School and is a sports presenter on BBC Breakfast. Berlie Doherty is an English writer who was also educated at Upton Hall School. A former teacher from the same school, Angela Topping, is also an English writer. Opera singer Joan Carlyle was born in Upton. Chris Shaw is an English synthpop musician from Upton. In religion, notable Anglican priests, who have both been incumbent at St. Mary's Church, are Cecil Druitt and George Aickin.

Founded in July 1944 by Dr. Mario Flores Ortiz. PSN operated as the official communist party in the country. At the time of its foundation, PSN supported the regime of Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a. PSN considered that Somoza (nominally a liberal) was an anti- fascist ally.Foroohar, Manzar. The Catholic Church and Social Change in Nicaragua. SUNY Press, 1989. p. 101-102 In the mid-1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 250.Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H.. Communism and Economic Development, in The American Political Science Review, Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar., 1968), pp. 122. After the surge of the FSLN (which had its origins in PSN), PSN was gradually side-lined. In 1967 a group of radicals who opted for armed struggle were expelled. They formed the Socialist Workers Party. In 1974 PSN joined UDEL. From 1976 onwards there was a PSN breakaway group, called the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (de los S√°nchez). Towards the end of the Somoza regime, PSN constructed the Organizaci√≥n Militar del Pueblo (Military Organization of the People). OMP carried out a few attacks against the regime. In 1990 PSN joined hands with right-wing forces in the National Opposition Union to topple the Sandinista government. PSN still exists, but is no longer a communist party per se. PSN publishes El Popular. For the 2006 Nicaraguan general election, it joined with the Sandinista Renovation Movement.

It is one of three forms of locomotion adopted by terrestrial mammals. The other options are digitigrade, walking on the toes with the heel and wrist permanently raised, and ungulates, walking on the nail or nails of the toes (the hoof) with the heel/wrist and the digits permanently raised. The leg of a plantigrade mammal includes the bones of the upper leg (femur/humerus) and lower leg (tibia and fibula/radius and ulna). The leg of a digitigrade mammal also includes the metatarsals/metacarpals, the bones that in a human compose the arch of the foot and the palm of the hand. The leg of an unguligrade mammal also includes the phalanges, the finger and toe bones. Among extinct animals, most early mammals such as pantodonts were plantigrade. A plantigrade foot is the primitive condition for mammals; digitigrade and unguligrade locomotion evolved later. Among archosaurs, the pterosaurs were partially plantigrade, walking on the whole of the hind foot and the fingers of the hand-wing. List of plantigrade mammals Plantigrade mammal species include (but are not limited to): *primates (including humans) *Carnivora: **Musteloidea: red pandas, skunks, raccoons, weasels **bears **Barbourofelis *rodents: mice, rats, porcupines *lagomorphs: rabbits *hedgehogs *hyraxes *Marsupialia: kangaroos Evolution The primary advantages of a plantigrade foot are stability and weight-bearing ability; plantigrade feet have the largest surface area. The primary disadvantage of a plantigrade foot is speed. With more bones and joints in the foot, the leg is both shorter and heavier at the far end, which makes it difficult to move rapidly. In humans and other great apes, another possible advantage of a plantigrade foot is that it may enhance fighting performance as it makes it easier to perform kicks. Plantigrade foot occurs normally in humans in static postures of standing and sitting. It should also occur normally in gait (walking). Hypertonicity, spasticity, clonus, limited range of motion, abnormal flexion neural pattern, and a plantar flexor (calf) muscle contracture, as well as some forms of footwear such as high heeled shoes, may contribute to an individual only standing and/or walking on his or her toes. This would be evident by the observable heel rise.

A regular columnist for the i and the London Evening Standard, she is a well-known commentator on immigration, diversity, and multiculturalism issues. She is a founding member of British Muslims for Secular Democracy. She is also a patron of the SI Leeds Literary Prize.Patrons , SI Leeds Literary Prize. Early life and family Alibhai-Brown was born in 1949 into the Ugandan Asian community in Kampala. Her family belonged to the Nizari Ismaili branch of the Shia Islamic faith, and she identifies as a Shia Muslim. Her mother was born in East Africa and her father moved there from British India in the 1920s. After graduating in English literature from Makerere University in 1972, Alibhai-Brown left Uganda for Britain, along with her niece, Farah Damji, shortly before the expulsion of Ugandan Asians by Idi Amin, and completed a Master of Philosophy degree in literature at Linacre College, University of Oxford, in 1975. After working as a teacher, particularly with immigrants and refugees, she moved into journalism in her mid-thirties. She is married to Colin Brown, chairman of the Consumer Services Panel of the Financial Services Authority. The couple have a daughter, and Alibhai-Brown has a son from a previous marriage. Career and views A journalist on the New Statesman magazine in the early 1980s, Alibhai-Brown contributes a weekly column to The Independent. She has also written for The Guardian, The Observer, The New York Times, Time magazine, Newsweek, and the Daily Mail, and has appeared on the current affairs TV shows Dateline London and The Wright Stuff. Alibhai-Brown has won awards for her journalism, including Media Personality of the Year in 2000 (awarded by the Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy (EMMA)), the George Orwell Prize for Political Journalism in 2002, and the EMMA Award for Journalism in 2004. Alibhai-Brown was a research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), a think tank associated with New Labour, from 1996 to 2001. She ended her connection with the Labour Party over the 2003 war in Iraq and other issues, and supported the Liberal Democrats in the 2005 and 2010 general elections. She is senior research associate at the Foreign Policy Centre, an honorary fellow at Liverpool John Moores University, and honorary visiting professor at Cardiff and Lincoln Universities. In the New Year Honours 2001, Alibhai-Brown was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) \\"for services to journalism\\". In 2003 Benjamin Zephaniah's public refusal of an OBE inspired her to return the award. She wrote that her decision had been made partly in a growing spirit of republicanism and partly in protest at the Labour government, particularly its conduct of the war in Iraq, and has since criticised the British honours system as \\"beyond repair\\". In May 2011, Alibhai-Brown wrote in The Independent that Muslims and others should stop focusing solely on the wrongdoings of Israel, saying that \\"We Muslims need to accept our burdens too.\\" She also said that, \\"It is no longer morally justifiable for activists to target only Israel and either ignore or find excuses for corrupt, murderous Arab despots. That kind of selectivity discredits pro-Palestinian campaigners and dishonours the principles of equality and human rights.\\" Brown previously condemned ethnic minority campaigners against racism failing to mention white victims of racially motivated crimes, suggesting they were guilty of double standards. Highlighting cases such as the murder of Ross Parker, Alibhai-Brown wrote: \\"Our values are worthless unless all victims of these senseless deaths matter equally\\", adding \\"to treat some victims as more worthy of condemnation than others is unforgivable and a betrayal of anti-racism itself\\". In May 2012, Alibhai-Brown received an anonymous three-page letter alleging that while the writer was a schoolgirl in the 1970s she had been sexually abused by veteran BBC presenter Stuart Hall. After Alibhai-Brown passed the letter to police, an investigation was initiated, culminating in Hall being arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual assault. On 16 April 2013, Hall pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting 13 girls, aged from nine to 17, during the period 1967‚Äì86. The police credited Alibhai-Brown's actions as instrumental in triggering an investigation into Hall's past. In 2016 Alibhai-Brown won the Columnist of the Year Broadsheet at the British Press Awards. Criticism Alibhai-Brown has attracted criticism for her views. Michael Wharton has accused her of an excessive pursuit of political correctness: \\"At 3.6 degrees on the Alibhai-Brown scale, it sets off a shrill scream that will not stop until you‚Äôve pulled yourself together with a well-chosen anti-racist slogan.\\"cited in Stephen Pollard accused her of racism and called her opinions \\"utterly vile\\" in The Jewish Chronicle in June 2008. In October 2009, Luciana Berger, M.P. and then director of Labour Friends of Israel, criticised Alibhai-Brown for writing in her column: \\"All three parties were lavishly entertained by the over-influential Friends of Israel.\\" Berger said that Alibhai-Brown had not attended the LFI event or provided any evidence to sustain her comment. Berger insisted the hospitality (\\"house wine or orange juice and chips. Crisps and peanuts if you got to a bowl in time\\") was not lavish.

She was launched at Harland & Wolff's yard at Belfast on 25 August 1949 by Mrs Leif Egeland, wife of the High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa in London. She was completed on 25 March 1950. Built for Union-Castle Line's Intermediate service to South and East Africa, she was their first one-class ship. She took her name after the town of Bloemfontein, capital of the Orange Free State. The Bloemfontein Castle was given the familiar Union-Castle profile of well-raked rounded stem, cruiser stern, a low streamlined funnel and a single mast abaft the bridge, giving a well-balanced appearance. There were two hatches forward and three aft, served by six 10-ton and four 5-ton capacity derricks. Cargo 'tweendeck spaces were insulated for the carriage of fruit, with certain compartments for chilled and frozen produce. The Bloemfontein Castle was the first intermediate liner to be built since the war had ended, and the institution of a single class-tourist was an innovation for Union-Castle. She was built to cater for an expected emigrant boom and to alleviate the still considerable pressure at the time for accommodation at lower range fares. The main public rooms were on the promenade deck, a large lounge forward being extended the whole width of the ship so there were no passageways either side. Aft of this was a combined library and writing room, connected by a long gallery to a commodious smoking room. On the upper deck a dining room for 386 also extended the width of the ship. Accommodation for 739 passengers was spread through seven decks. Some 250 of Union-Castle's staff were invited for the shakedown cruise made from London in March, 1950. She left London on her maiden voyage on 6 April 1950 ‚Äì sailing the London ‚Äì Rotterdam ‚Äì Las Palmas ‚Äì Ascension ‚Äì St. Helena ‚Äì Walvis Bay ‚Äì Cape Town ‚Äì Port Elizabeth ‚Äì East London ‚Äì Durban ‚Äì Louren√ßo Marques ‚Äì Beira route that she alone served. She sometimes called at Southampton homewards during the busy fruit season. On 8 January 1953, Bloemfontein Castle rescued 234 passengers and crew from the Holland Afrika liner Klipfontein which was sinking after hitting a sunken German U-boat off Mozambique. Captain J. A. Fergurson and his senior officers later received commemorative gifts from the Holland Afrika Line. When the expected flow of European emigrants to South Africa did not materialize, Bloemfontein Castle was sold to the Greek Chandris Lines in 1959, after a short life of only nine years with Union-Castle. Renamed Patris and refitted in just three weeks for Chandris' service between Europe and Australia, the ship was the first large liner in the Chandris fleet. After Darwin was almost destroyed by Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Day in 1974, the Patris anchored in Darwin Harbour for nine months to provide emergency accommodation for those left homeless. In 1979 Chandris sold Patris to Karageorgis Lines, who first renamed her Mediterranean Island then Mediterranean Star in 1981. She was refitted and used as a ferry until sold to Pakistani breakers in 1987.

ATLIS was developed starting in 1976, entering service in 1980. It was developed for the French Arm√©e de l'Air, initially carried by SEPECAT Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft. ATLIS incorporates a laser designator boresighted with a television camera. The pilot or weapon systems officer uses the crosshairs to mark a target, which can then be attacked with laser-guided bombs or other guided weapons from the designating aircraft or other, friendly forces. Because it is designed for use by single-seat aircraft, it has a novel automatic lock-on feature, which keeps the laser focused on the target without further operator intervention (using an inertial guidance system, it can generally keep the laser on target even if the beam is temporarily interrupted by clouds). ATLIS II is used by the SEPECAT Jaguar, Mirage F1, Mirage 2000, Mirage 2000N, and some Pakistani F-16s. It is compatible with various U.S. and French laser-guided bombs, with the French Aerospatiale AS-30L missile, and even with some Russian bombs and guided weapons. In 1985, Pakistan Air Force selected ATLIS-II for its F-16 aircraft, making it the first non-European operator of this system. ATLIS-II pod is carried on the 5L intake station on the F-16. Over the years precision targeting using ATLIS has been a distinct phenomenon over-viewed regularly in PAF‚Äô s operational exercises. In the recent PAF operations in Global War on Terrorism, ATLIS-II was extensively used for precision targeting. The pod is limited in being primarily a daylight/clear-weather system.

History The name derives from either the Old Norse word Lundr or the Old Swedish word lunder, both meaning \\"grove\\" or \\"copse\\". This was likely a reference to the remnants of a large ancient forest that existed in the area at the time the settlement was founded. The town was first documented in 1251 in the Chartulary of Cockersand Abbey, where it was referred to as \\"de Lund\\". However, earlier settlement have been discovered through recent archaeological excavations at Lunt Meadows which were commissioned and funded by the Environment Agency, supported by National Museums Liverpool ahead of the transformation of farmland in the Alt valley, Sefton into a wetland reserve and flood alleviation scheme. These excavations found settlement buildings dating back to the mesolithic period (5800 BC) when the inhabitants were still living as hunter-gatherers Governance From 1997 until 2010 the village of Lunt was part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency represented by George Howarth, a Labour Party MP. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency was abolished with Sefton East, including Lunt, being merged with the northern parts of the former Crosby constituency, which was also abolished, to form the new Sefton Central constituency which is represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1995, and a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Howard Pawley from 1982 to 1988. He was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the son of Clifford Earl Storie and Iris Eloise Young, and was educated at Brandon University and the University of Manitoba. In 1970, Storie married Betty Louise Embury. (She died in March 2007.) They moved to Flin Flon in 1975 and he worked as a teacher and sociologist for the Flin Flon School Division before entering public life. Storie was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1981 general election, defeating Progressive Conservative Bob McNeil by over 1400 votes in the northern riding of Flin Flon. He entered the cabinet on August 20, 1982, having been appointed Minister of Housing, with responsibility for the Landlord and Tenant Act, the Residential Rent Corporation Act, the Housing and Renewal Corporation Act and the Infirm Persons' Housing Act. Following a cabinet shuffle on November 4, 1983, Storie was named Minister of Northern Affairs with responsibility for the Communities Economic Development Fund Act, the Manitoba Natural Resources Act, and Manitoba Forestry Resources Ltd.. He was relieved of the Northern Affairs portfolio and the first two responsibilities on January 30, 1985, and named Minister of Business Development and Tourism, with responsibility for Manitoba Data Services (he also retained the Forestry responsibility). Storie was re-elected by a substantial majority in the 1986 provincial election. On April 17, 1986, he was promoted to Minister of Education, and on September 21, 1987 was again shifted to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, with responsibility for Manitoba Hydro and the Natural Resources Development Act. On November 23, 1987, he was also given responsibility for the Natural Gas Supply Act. Throughout his second term in office, he retained responsibility for Forestry. The NDP government of Howard Pawley was defeated in 1988, when disgruntled backbencher Jim Walding voted against his government's budget. The party was reduced to only twelve seats (out of fifty-seven) in the election which followed, although Storie was re-elected in his riding without any serious difficulties. He was again re-elected in the 1990 provincial election, in which the NDP recovered to twenty seats. He retired from the legislature on July 20, 1994. He returned to the field of education as Area 4 Superintendent for the Frontier School Division in Cranberry Portage, Manitoba throughout the late 1990s. In 2001, Storie negotiated on behalf of Manitoba's provincial government in a dispute with the Canadian federal government over hydro resources. He later became Superintendent of the Turtle Mountain school division in Manitoba. Storie was appointed the Dean of Education at Brandon University in 2005.

Individuals born with SCID are abnormally susceptible to infections, and exposure to typically innocuous pathogens can be fatal. Vetter was referred to as \\"David, the bubble boy\\" by the media, as a reference to the complex containment system used as part of the management of his SCID. Vetter's surname was not revealed to the general public until 10 years after his death in order to preserve his family's privacy. In his first years of life he lived mostly at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, Texas. As he grew older, he lived increasingly at home with his parents and older sister Katherine in Dobbin, Texas. He died in 1984, at the age of 12. Family and birth Vetter's parents were David Joseph Vetter, Jr. and Carol Ann Vetter. Their first son, David Joseph Vetter III, was also born with SCID and died at 7 months of age. Vetter's parents were advised by physicians that any future male children they might conceive would have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. At the time, the only management available for children born with SCID was isolation in a sterile environment until a successful bone marrow transplant could be performed. The Vetters, who already had a daughter, decided to proceed with another pregnancy. Their third child, David Phillip Vetter, was born September 21, 1971. A special sterilized cocoon bed was prepared for Vetter at his birth. Immediately after being removed from his mother's uterus, Vetter entered the plastic germ-free environment that would be his home for most of his life. Vetter was baptized a Roman Catholic with sterilized holy water once he had entered the bubble. Initial plans to proceed with a bone marrow transplant came to a halt after it was determined that the prospective donor, Vetter's sister, Katherine, was not a match.David Vetter's Sister , The American Experience Life in the bubble David Vetter inside his protective bubble. Water, air, food, diapers and clothes were sterilized before entering the sterile chamber. Items were placed in a chamber filled with ethylene oxide gas for four hours at 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60ÀöC), and then aerated for a period of one to seven days before being placed in the sterile chamber. After being placed in the sterile chamber, Vetter was touched only through special plastic gloves attached to the walls of the chamber. The chamber was kept inflated by air compressors that were very loud, making communications with the boy very difficult. His parents and medical team, which included Dr. John Montgomery, sought to provide him as normal a life as possible, including a formal education, and a television and playroom inside the sterile chamber. About three years after Vetter's birth, the treatment team built an additional sterile chamber in his parents' home in Conroe, Texas, and a transport chamber so that Vetter could spend periods of two to three weeks at home. Vetter had his sister and friends for company while at home. A friend arranged for a special showing of Return of the Jedi at a local theater so that Vetter could attend the movie in his transport chamber.The Boy In The Bubble . American Experience, PBS When Vetter was four years old, he discovered that he could poke holes in his bubble using a butterfly syringe that was left inside the chamber by mistake. At this point, the treatment team explained to him what germs were and how they affected his condition. As he grew older, he became aware of the world outside his chamber, and expressed an interest in participating in what he could see outside the windows of the hospital and via television. In 1977, researchers from NASA used their experience with the fabrication of space suits to develop a special suit that would allow Vetter to get out of his bubble and walk in the outside world. The suit was connected to his bubble via an eight-foot (2.5 m) long cloth tube and although cumbersome, it allowed him to venture outside without serious risk of contamination. Vetter was initially resistant to the suit, and although he later became more comfortable wearing it, he used it only seven times. He outgrew the suit and never used the replacement one provided for him by NASA. Death Approximately $1.3 million was spent on Vetter's care, but scientific study failed to produce a true \\"cure\\" and no donor match had been identified. Vetter later received a bone marrow transplant from his sister, Katherine. While his body did not reject the transplant, he became ill with infectious mononucleosis after a few months. He died 15 days later on February 22, 1984, from Burkitt's lymphoma at age 12. The autopsy revealed that Katherine's bone marrow contained traces of a dormant virus, Epstein‚ÄìBarr, which had been undetectable in the pre-transplant screening.Roane, Kit (December 6, 2015). \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" .

Legacy An elementary school which opened in 1990 in The Woodlands in unincorporated Montgomery County, Texas, was named David Elementary after Vetter. Aftermath Vetter's parents later divorced. His father went on to become the mayor of Shenandoah, Texas. His mother married Kent Demaret, a magazine reporter who had written about her son. Vetter's psychologist, Mary Murphy, wrote a book about Vetter's case that was to be published in 1995; however, its initial publication was blocked by his parents and Baylor College of Medicine.

Squeezed between the often-tempestuous Tasman Sea to the west and steep forested cloud- shrouded mountains to the immediate east, the town is the largest in this sparsely populated part of New Zealand. Long known as a coal-mining town, the population has declined as the industry has waned. The population was 237 in the 2013 census, an increase of 18 from 2006. Several neighbouring towns, such as Denniston, have become virtually ghost towns. The name \\"Granity\\" was given to the town by gold prospectors, in reference to the large quantity of granite in the area.  Economy  The Granity Creek Sawmill was established in 1846 and was a significant employer in the area. The town was also the location of the engineering division of the Westport Coal Company, and the railway station was used for loading and dispatching coal from the nearby Millerton mine.

In the 1930s DKW pioneered the Schn√ºrle two-stroke loop scavenging process to dispense with the use of a deflector piston and improve efficiency of the combustion chamber. DKW also developed a highly efficient arrangement of transfer ports. These two features were included in the RT 125 to great commercial advantage. Competitor companies such as Adler and TWN copied the adoption of flat-topped pistons and strove to develop equally transfer port arrangements without infringing DKW's patent. Copies and variants Copies of the RT 125 were built by at least eight different entities in at least six countries. War reparations After World War II the Soviet Union took plans, tooling and even several dozen personnel as war reparations to MMZ in Moscow (later transferred to MMVZ and SMZ) and to a factory in Kovrov, and produced copies of the RT 125 as the M1A Moskva and K-125 respectively. WFM of Poland made a modified version of the RT 125 (under SHL 125 and Sok√≥≈Ç 125 brands), developed into 125/175 cc family motorcycles, produced until 1985. RT 125 plans were also taken to the United Kingdom where they became the basis of the BSA Bantam, and to the USA where they formed the basis of the Harley- Davidson \\"Hummer\\" (Hummer is really just a few specific years, but generally people call the Harley lightweights Hummers). Postwar German production: DKW and MZ After the Second World War, DKW's factories in Zschopau were in the Soviet occupation zone. As such, they were under the control of the Soviet Union until they were handed over to the government of East Germany. The factory continued production of the RT 125 under the MZ (Motorradwerk Zschopau) brand into the 1950s. Meanwhile, DKW had reorganized itself in Ingolstadt, where it began production of the RT 125W (for \\"West\\") in 1949. Variants of the RT 125W, usually with larger engines, were in production throughout the 1950s. Yamaha YA-1 Yamaha YA-1 In the 1950s, after reestablishing themselves as manufacturers of musical instruments, Nippon Gakki decided to use the manufacturing equipment left over from wartime production to make motorcycles. Since the copyright on the RT 125 had been voided by the Allies, the company reverse engineered it as the basis for their first motorcycle. Nippon Gakki formed the Yamaha Motor Company in 1955 to build their copy of the RT 125 as the Yamaha YA-1, which was in production from 1955 to 1958.

The R-2600-3 was originally intended for the C-46 Commando (being fitted to the prototype CW-20A). It was also the original engine choice for the F6F Hellcat; a running change (one which would not stop production) for the CW-20A, and one in late April 1942 for the second XF6F-1, led to the adoption of the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp in the R-2600's place for both designs. The Twin Cyclone went on to power several important American World War II aircraft, including the A-20 Havoc, B-25 Mitchell, TBF Avenger, SB2C Helldiver, and the PBM Mariner.

During his days with Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians, he used his childhood nickname \\"Lumpy\\". Early years Brannum was born in Sandwich, Illinois, in 1910 to a Methodist minister. He attended Maine Township High School in suburban Chicago, where he played sousaphone in the school's marching band, later learning the bass violin. He went to college at University of Redlands, where he became interested in jazz; after graduation in 1931, he played bass in various bands. Career Keeshan (l.) and Brannum on set During World War II, he enlisted in the US Marine Corps and joined a Marine band led by Bob Crosby. After the war, he joined the Four Squires, later moving to Fred Waring and His Pennsylvanians; Waring's group had a regular radio show, where Hugh met fellow Marine Bob Keeshan, an employee at the station who later hired Brannum for Captain Kangaroo. Before his time on Captain Kangaroo, he hosted a local children's TV series called Uncle Lumpy's Cabin, seen weekday mornings on WJZ- TV, (now WABC-TV) in New York City during the 1951 season. Mr. Green Jeans earned his moniker from his distinctive apparel, a pair of farmer's overalls (later, jeans and a denim jacket) in his signature green (although, since the show was broadcast in black-and-white for much of its run, this was lost on viewers). He was a talented and inquisitive handyman who provided assistance at the Treasure House. He frequently visited the Captain with the latest addition to his menagerie of zoo animals. Aside from Mr. Green Jeans, Brannum played a number of characters on Captain Kangaroo from 1955 to 1984, including the Professor, Greeno the Clown, the New Old Folk Singer, and Mr. Bainter the Painter. His role as Mr. Green Jeans was partly based on stories about a farm kid named \\"Little Orley\\" that he told with the Fred Waring orchestra, on the radio and on 78-rpm records under the pseudonym \\"Uncle Lumpy\\". According to Bob Keeshan, Mr. Green Jeans was an extension of Brannum's real personality. The shows were performed before a live audience. During one episode of Captain Kangaroo, a lion cub bit Brannum's finger and drew blood. Brannum stuck his bleeding hand into his pocket and never broke character for the remainder of the episode.Little Orley Lil Orly Orlie Records by Uncle Lumpy Death Brannum died of cancer in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1987.

In 1893, in Chicago, Modjeski opened his own design office, which still exists as \\"Modjeski & Masters,\\" after it was joined in 1924 by Frank M. Masters. Modjeski's first project as chief engineer was the railroad bridge across the Mississippi River at Rock Island, Illinois. During his career, he served as chief or consulting engineer on dozens of bridges around the country. He took over the mis-designed Quebec Bridge after the 1907 disaster that killed 75 workers, and succeeded in creating the longest truss span in the world (though a construction accident killed another thirteen workers). It is still the longest cantilever bridge in the world. Modjeski was world-famous as a designer of bridges and rail lines. He pioneered suspension bridges. He built nearly 40 bridges spanning the great rivers of North America. He trained succeeding generations of American bridge designers and builders, including Joseph B. Strauss, chief engineer of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge (which was completed six months after Modjeski's San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge). Modjeski was considered \\"America's greatest bridge builder.\\" He was the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees. In 1911 he received a doctorate in engineering from Illinois State University, in 1923 the Franklin Medal, in 1929 a doctorate honoris causa from the Lw√≥w Polytechnic, in 1930 the prestigious John Fritz Medal. He died June 26, 1940, in Los Angeles, California.

Although Pentagon spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has not come forward with documentation that explains how it arrived at the figure of 377 tons of missing explosives. The IAEA so far only has verified in its paperwork that 219 tons of explosive materials were at Al-Qaqaa and surrounding facilities. The explosives, considered dangerous by the IAEA, were certified by UN weapons inspectors to be inside facilities whose doors were fastened with chains and the United Nations' seal, at the Al Qa'qaa industrial complex in Iraq in 2003. By October 2004, the facility was empty. Background In October 2004, the Iraqi interim government warned the U.S. that nearly 380 tons of conventional explosives had been removed from the Al-Qa'qaa facility. The Bush Administration was criticized for failing to guard known weapons stashes of this size after the invasion. Critics of the Bush Administration claimed that U.S. forces were to blame for the looting, which put weapons that were formerly under UN control into the hands of insurgents. The Bush Administration asserted before the 2004 U.S. election that the explosives were either removed by Iraq before invaders captured the facility, or properly accounted for by US forces, even while White House and Pentagon officials acknowledged that they had vanished after the invasion. MSNBC News wrote: :\\"Whether Saddam Hussein's forces removed the explosives before U.S. forces arrived April 3, 2003, or whether they fell into the hands of looters and insurgents afterward ‚Äî because the site was not guarded by U.S. troops ‚Äî has become a key issue in the campaign.\\"Pentagon: Some explosives possibly destroyed - Conflict in Iraq - nbcnews.com Time Magazine reported the sequence of events: \\"In late April IAEA's chief weapons inspector for Iraq warned the U.S. of the vulnerability of the site, and in May 2003, an internal IAEA memo warned that terrorists could be looting \\"the greatest explosives bonanza in history.\\" Seventeen months later, on Oct. 10, in response to a long-standing request from the IAEA to account for sensitive materials, the interim Iraqi government notified the agency that al-Qaqaa had been stripped clean. The White House learned about the notification a few days later.\\" Evidence indicated that the explosives were most likely removed after invading US forces captured the facility. The looting was witnessed by U.S. Army reservists and National Guardsman from separate units as well as officials of the new Iraqi government. Frank Rich editorialized in The New York Times (May 15, 2005): :It's also because of incompetent Pentagon planning that other troops may now be victims of weapons looted from Saddam's munitions depots after the fall of Baghdad. Yet when The New York Times reported one such looting incident, in Al Qaqaa, before the election, the administration and many in the blogosphere reflexively branded the story fraudulent. But the story was true. It was later corroborated not only by United States Army reservists and national guardsmen who spoke to The Los Angeles Times but also by Iraq's own deputy minister of industry, who told The New York Times two months ago that Al Qaqaa was only one of many such weapon caches hijacked on America's undermanned post-invasion watch. For a timeline of events resulting in the storage and subsequent loss of the high explosives, please see Al Qa'qaa high explosives timeline. Other facilities looted Sami al-Araji, Iraq's deputy minister of industry, noted that besides al Qa'qaa, looters had targeted explosives and other weapons material in the Nida Factory, the Badr General Establishment, Al Ameer, Al Radwan, Al Hatteen, and Al Qadisiya. Some of these factories had WMD significance, such as the Nida Factory and Al Radwan, which were part of Saddam's nuclear program in the early 1990s. The looting of five of these sites were also confirmed by the IAEA's satellite reconnaissance. Former U.S. Ambassador Peter W. Galbraith (who supported Bush's war in Iraq) reported two additional incidents of significant looting in post-invasion Iraq. He witnessed U.S. troops standing outside Baghdad's Disease Center as looters attacked the complex on 16 April 2003, \\"taking live HIV and black fever virus among other potentially lethal materials.\\" At the same time, looters attacked Iraq's nuclear facilities at Tuwaitha, taking \\"barrels of yellowcake (raw uranium), apparently dumping the uranium and using the barrels to hold water. US troops were at Tuwaitha but did not interfere.\\" Galbraith noted that the facilities were all under IAEA seal and that \\"they remained untouched until the US troops arrived.\\" Former counterterrorism directors for the National Security Council Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon noted the danger of these nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists as a result of the U.S. invasion: \\"Another potential consequence of the invasion is the spread of weapons of mass destruction to al-Qaeda or other terrorists... [T]he International Atomic Energy Agency certified that there were highly radioactive materials at the al-Tuwaitha facilities, including partially enriched‚Äîthough not weapons-grade‚Äîuranium. These materials could be used to fabricate one or more radiological dispersion devices‚Äîor 'dirty bombs,' as they have come to be known. Some of these materials appear to be missing‚Äîhow much remains unclear‚Äîand it seems a fair conjecture that someone ... may have 'privatized' these weapons with the intent of selling them to the highest biddeer. Ultimately, this material could find its way into the hands of al-Qaeda. It is difficult to imagine a more horrifyingly ironic outcome to the war.\\"Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, The Age of Sacred Terror: Radical Islam's War against America (New York: Random House, 2003) p. 462. Impact of the looting Many commentators expressed fears that the explosives had fallen into the hands of terrorists and would be used by the Iraqi insurgency to mount attacks against US and Iraqi troops. Many insurgent attacks have been carried out using improvised explosive devices made from military munitions, most often 122 mm artillery shells and landmines. IEDs made with high explosives are far more powerful and devastating and have been used in some of the most damaging attacks carried out in Iraq, such as the August 19, 2003 suicide attack on the U.N. headquarters, and the March 17, 2004 attack on the Mount Lebanon Hotel, both in Baghdad. It is not clear whether these attacks were mounted using explosives from Al Qa'qaa. However, on October 28, 2004 a video was released by a group calling itself \\"Al-Islam's Army Brigades, Al- Karar Brigade\\" in which a masked man claimed that \\"the American intelligence\\" had helped them to obtain a \\"huge amount of the explosives that were in the Al Qa'qaa facility\\" and that the explosives would be \\"use[d] against the occupation forces and those who cooperate with them in the event of these forces threatening any Iraqi city.\\" And a December 2003 report from a joint Defense Department intelligence task force concluded that the insurgents in Iraq \\"retain access to virtually all the weapons systems and ordnances previously controlled by the Iraqi military, security and intelligence assets. Unsecured arms depots and storage sites, in addition to open and black market availability of weapons and ammunition, eliminate the need for the [insurgents] to maintain a formidable arsenal.\\" Montgomery McFate of the Human Terrain Team program noted in 2005: The high explosives The high explosives were stored under the supervision of the United Nations due to their sensitive nature and dual use in WMDs. According to the IAEA, there were 340 tonnes consisting of: * 194.741 tonnes of HMX, * 141.233 tonnes of RDX, and * 5.800 tonnes of PETN. These explosives were stored in solid crystalline form and could be used to make powerful plastic explosives, are safe to transport and do not detonate on impact. The total quantity, 341.744 tonnes (753,417 pounds), would require approximately 40 large trucks to convey. Chemical weapons equipment In addition to the explosives, al Qa'qaa held some of the remnants of Iraq's chemical warfare program from the early 1990s, \\"including 800 pieces of chemical equipment.\\" The areas that had been involved in chemical processing were \\"wrecked by fire and possible extensive looting\\" after the invasion; as The New York Times reported, \\"Unknown is the fate of such equipment there like separators, heat exchangers, mixers and chemical reactors, all of which can be used in making chemical weapons.\\" (13 March 2005). The Times reported that \\"the kinds of machinery at the various sites included equipment that could be used to make missile parts, chemical weapons or centrifuges essential for enriching uranium for atom bombs.\\" Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, said, \\"Targeted looting of this kind of equipment has to be seen as a proliferation threat.\\" The storage facilities The HMX was stored at the Qa'qaa Store, one of a number of facilities at the Al Qa'qaa complex in Iraq. Al Qa'Qaa is very large, occupying 28 km¬≤ of land near to Iskandariya and about 48 km south of Baghdad. It includes almost 1100 individual structures and buildings. This is about the same size as Newport, Rhode Island, Little Cayman or Bath. As a result of its large size, most accounts of the complex deal only with a specific facility located within its bounds. The Qa'qaa Store was located at the southern end of the facility in underground bunkers. The bunker doors were sealed by IAEA officials upon being closed. Although the doors were sealed, the bunker itself was not hermetically sealed. Air ventilation shafts leading into the bunkers were not sealed. The high explosives subject to the controversy were the only materials under UN seal at Al Qa'qaa. The RDX was stored at the Al Mahaweel Stores, a site physically separate from, but administered by, Al Qa'qaa. Satellite imagery of the main Al Qa'qaa complex (about 28 km ¬π) is publicly available for 2001 from GlobalSecurity.orgAl Qa Qaa and for 2003 and 2004 from DigitalGlobe.DigitalGlobe Sample Imagery Claims of removal prior to US arrival * \\"A U.S. Army officer came forward Friday, October 29, 2004 to say a team from his 3rd Infantry Division took about 250 tons of munitions and other material, including plastic explosives, from the Al-Qaqaa arms-storage facility 10 days after Saddam Hussein's regime fell in April 2003. According to ABC News, however, \\"the Pentagon stopped short of saying that the material that is reputed to be lost, missing, unaccounted for is the material that this exploitation team took away.\\" (ABC World News Tonight, 31 October 2004). * An aerial photograph declassified and released by Donald Rumsfeld showing two trucks at the site after IAEA inspectors last visited it before the invasion.

The Al Qa'qaa complex was occupied for two days by the United States Army's 3rd Infantry Division following a brief battle on April 3, 2003, shortly before the fall of Baghdad. Although no banned weapons were discovered, atropine and 2-Pam chloride -- both antidotes for nerve gas -- were reported found there. Thousands of bottles of white powder were also discovered, but were found to be explosives rather than chemical weapons. On April 10, 2003, troops from the Second Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division arrived at Al Qa'qaa en route to Baghdad. They stopped overnight and moved on the following day. According to the brigade's commander, Colonel Joseph Anderson, at this point the complex showed few signs of looting or damage. Al Qa'qaa was reportedly unoccupied and unguarded until the arrival of the 75th Exploration Task Force (better known as Task Force 75) on May 27. By this time, according to Wathiq al-Dulaimi, a local security chief, and other local Iraqis, the complex had been thoroughly looted with enterprising locals even renting their trucks to looters. Task Force 75 found that the complex had largely been stripped of anything of value. Although they searched 32 bunkers and 87 other buildings, they found no signs of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. The team did not find any of the explosives sealed by the IAEA inspectors two months earlier. On April 13, a team from the 3rd Infantry Division led by Maj. Austin Pearson arrived at Al-Qaqaa. Pearson said at a Pentagon news conference that his mission was to secure and destroy ammunition and explosives. He estimated that his team, \\"Task Force Bullet\\", removed 250 tons of material including TNT, plastic explosives, detonation cords and munitions.\\"U.S. Team Took 250 Tons of Iraqi Munitions \\", FOX News (30 October 2004). Pearson's story provoked skepticism as it came the morning after new videotape surfaced indicating that the explosives were still at the base after Saddam's fall; the videotape (from April 18, 2003) shows what appeared to be high explosives still in barrels bearing IAEA seals. \\"The photographs are consistent with what I know of Al-Qaqaa\\", David A. Kay, who directed the hunt in Iraq for WMD and visited the site, told The New York Times. \\"The damning thing is the seals. The Iraqis didn't use seals on anything. So I'm absolutely sure that's an IAEA seal.\\" The situation did not become publicly known for over a year afterwards, but IAEA officials reportedly warned as early as May 2003 that looting at Al Qa'qaa could be \\"the greatest explosives bonanza in history.\\" Although IAEA inspectors were unable to inspect the site themselves due to the US ban on their presence, they were able to obtain commercial satellite imagery in late 2003 that showed severe damage to the facility. Two of roughly ten bunkers in which high explosives had been stored appeared to have been leveled by blasts. Other bunkers were damaged and some were untouched.James Glanz, William J. Broad, and David E. Sanger, \\"Huge Cache of Explosives Vanished From Site in Iraq\\", The New York Times (25 October 2004). On October 10, 2004, Dr. Mohammed J. Abbas of the Iraqi Ministry of Science and Technology wrote to the IAEA to say that the Qa'qaa stockpile had been lost after April 9, 2003, because of the \\"theft and looting of the governmental installations due to lack of security.\\" Nearly 340 tonnes of HDX and RDX explosives, an amount equivalent to 40 ten-ton truckloads, was said to be missing. The news led to an immediate controversy in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. Presidential challenger John Kerry has accused President George W. Bush of presiding over an inexcusable failure to prevent the loss of the explosives, while President Bush has criticized Senator Kerry for \\"jump[ing] to conclusions without knowing the facts.\\" On October 28, 2004, the DoD released imagery dated March 17, 2003, showing two trucks parked outside one of the 56 bunkers at Al Qa Qaa. However, the bunker nearest where the trucks were parked are not any of the nine bunkers identified by the IAEA as containing the missing explosive stockpiles. On the same day, the London Financial Times reported that the French and Russians may have been involved in the removal of the explosives from Al Qa'qaa before the war began, quoting Deputy Undersecretary for Defense John A. Shaw, who said \\"various Russian units on the eve of hostilities [helped] to orchestrate the collection of munitions and assure their transport out of Iraq via Syria\\". He also told The Washington Times \\"the organized effort was done in advance of the conflict\\". The Washington Times also reported that defense officials believed the Russians could also explain what happened to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. The Russian Government has denounced this theory as \\"nonsense\\", saying that there were no Russian military in the country at the time. Shaw's theory has attracted little public support from elsewhere in the Administration. On October 29, 2004, The New York Times reported the existence of a videotape made by a KSTP-TV St. Paul, Minnesota television crew embedded with U.S. 101st Airborne Division troops on April 18, 2003, nine days after Hussein's fall. The television crew accompanying US troops recorded the sealed explosives containers at the site, displaying the ammunition cache of explosives and other weapons supplies. Commentators have pointed out that the complex would have been under intensive surveillance during the war as a suspected centre of WMD production. They point out that an operation involving removing 40 truckloads of materials should have been extremely visible and would probably have been attacked, had it been spotted. Some said that the materials being moved might just as easily have been WMDs being moved to the battlefront. However, there is no indication that any such transport operation was spotted by US forces. The tape displaying the sealed explosives containers, as they were being found by the 101st Airborne Division troops, was re-broadcast by ABC on October 27, and by MSNBC on October 28, 2004. The explosives, classified as \\"dual use\\" materials, had been sealed by the IAEA, and reported 18 months earlier. The Administration subsequently stated that it was a \\"mystery\\" when the explosives disappeared and that the President did not want to comment on the matter until the facts were known. The Bush administration asserted that an investigation had begun into how, where, and when the explosives went missing; no such investigation has been reported on since the 2004 election. In May 2005, Iraqi official Sami al-Araji reported on the Iraqi government's investigation into the theft, indicating that the looters \\"came in with the cranes and the lorries, and they depleted the whole sites. They knew what they were doing; they knew what they want. This was sophisticated looting.\\" (The New York Times, March 13, 2005).

Willow Run, also known as Air Force Plant 31, was a manufacturing complex in Michigan, located between Ypsilanti Township and Belleville, constructed by the Ford Motor Company for the mass production of aircraft, especially the B-24 Liberator heavy bomber. Construction of the Willow Run Bomber Plant began in 1940 and was completed in 1942.  Defense plant  Turning out parts for bomber planes at Willow Run, 1942 The plant began production in summer 1941; the dedication plaque is dated June 16. The plant initially built components. The aircraft manufacturer Douglas Aircraft, and the B-24's designer Consolidated Aircraft, assembled the finished airplane. Remote assembly proved problematic, however, and by October 1941 Ford received permission to produce complete Liberators.Lloyd, Alwyn T. (1993), Liberator: America's Global Bomber, Pictorial Histories Publishing Co, Inc, O'Leary, Michael, (2003), Consolidated B-24 Liberator (Osprey Production Line to Frontline 4), Osprey Publishing, Willow Run's Liberator assembly line ran through May 1945, building almost half of all the Liberators produced. Airport Willow Run Airport was built as part of the bomber plant. The airfield passed into civilian hands after the war and is now controlled by Wayne County Airport Authority. Part of the airport complex operated at various times as a research facility affiliated with the University of Michigan, and as a secondary United States Air Force Installation. Willow Run Airport has remained active as a cargo and general aviation airfield and, since 1992, it has been home to the Yankee Air Museum. Postwar Ford built the factory and sold it to the government, then leased it back for the duration of the war. When Ford declined to purchase the facility after the war, Kaiser-Frazer Corporation gained ownership, and in 1953 Ford's rival General Motors took ownership and operated the factory as Willow Run Transmission until 2010. Willow Run Assembly operated from 1959 to 1992 on a parcel to the south of the airport. The Fisher Body division also operated at Willow Run Assembly until its operations were assumed by the GM Assembly Division in the 1970s. In 2009 General Motors announced that it would shut down all operations at the GM Powertrain plant and engineering center in the coming year. Since the 2010 closure of Willow Run Transmission, the factory complex has been managed by the RACER Trust, which controls the properties of the former General Motors. In 2011 A.E. Equities Group Holdings offered to buy the former Powertrain plant from the RACER Trust. In April 2013 a redevelopment manager for the RACER Trust confirmed that, whether or not the Yankee Air Museum relocates to the original bomber plant at a future date, unused portions of the powertrain plant would likely be razed as a step toward redeveloping the property. The majority of the plant was demolished in late 2013 and early 2014. The Willow Run complex has given its name to a community on the east side of Ypsilanti, defined roughly by the boundaries of the Willow Run Community School District. History Inspection of the landing gear of a transport plane at Willow Run Willow Run takes its name from a small tributary of the Huron River that meandered through pastureland and woods along the Wayne‚ÄìWashtenaw county line until the late 1930s. By the mid-1920s a local family operating as Quirk Farms had bought the land in Van Buren Township that became the airport. Quirk Farms was purchased by automobile pioneer Henry Ford in 1931. Ford, a keen exponent of the virtues of country living, used it as farmland for a \\"social engineering\\" experiment that brought inner-city boys to the Willow Run Camp to learn about farming, nature, and the rural way of life.  Camp Willow Run  The residents of the Willow Run Camp planted, tended, and harvested field crops and collected maple syrup, selling their products at the farm market on the property. In the process, the boys were to learn self- discipline and the values of hard work, and benefit from the fresh air of the country. Camp Willow Run was for boys age 17-19, mostly sons of dead or disabled WWI vets and those helping to support their families. According to the Benson Ford Research Center, the camp offered:  Chapel of Martha and Mary  Henry and Clara Bryant Ford dedicated a series of churches, the chapels of Martha and Mary as a perpetual tribute to their mothers, Mary Ford and Martha Bryant. The Fords built seven of these: The first at Greenfield Village, Michigan, was completed in 1929. The others, completed in the 1930s, were located in Dearborn, Michigan (site of the Fords' Fair Lane estate); Sudbury, Massachusetts; two in Richmond Hill, Georgia (the Fords' winter home); Macon, Michigan; and Willow Run. The Willow Run Chapel was the one originally built for Camp Willow Run, and became the place of worship for the Belleville Presbyterian Church in 1979 after a series of handoffs. After the war, Ford sold the chapel to Kaiser-Frazer, who in turn sold it to General Motors as part of the purchase of the Willow Run bomber plant. GM used the building to store files until an undetermined time, where it was sold to the Cherry Hill Baptist Church. When Cherry Hill outgrew the little chapel and decided to build a new church, it sold the chapel to the Belleville Presbyterian Church for one dollar in July 1978. The Willow Run chapel of Martha and Mary now stands a few miles from where it was originally constructed and on property that used to be owned by Henry Ford's Quirk Farms. Of the seven chapels, this is the only one currently in use as a regular place of worship. It still has the original pews and other furnishings; the only other set in active use belongs to the Greenfield Village chapel. From farm to flight line Like virtually all of the United States' industrial concerns, Ford Motor Company, by this time under the direction of Henry Ford's only son Edsel, directed its manufacturing output during World War II to Allied war production. In early 1941 the Federal government established the Liberator Production Pool Program to meet the projected demand for the B-24, and the Ford company, joined the program shortly thereafter. Ford Motor would not only build the bombers, it would supply the airfield as well; the farm at Willow Run was an ideal location for the airfield's runways, being under the personal ownership of Henry Ford (thus solving any land acquisition problem) and sited between the main roads and rail lines connecting Detroit with Ann Arbor and points to the west. Easements were acquired from landowners across the county line in Ypsilanti Township where the Liberator plant (and eventually the airport terminal) would be built. Although officially retired, Henry Ford still had a say in the company's affairs and refused government financing for Willow Run, preferring to have his company build the factory and sell it to the government, which would lease it back to the company for the duration of the war. Ford Motor was to have first option on the plant after war production ended, an option it ultimately chose not to exercise, although a rumor in Drew Pearson's syndicated column had Ford planning a postwar use as a tractor factory, but that never came to pass. Ford would eventually sell its land to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation's Defense Plant Corporation in July 1944, shortly after the Ford farms were transferred to the company's ownership. Architect Albert Kahn designed the main structure of the Willow Run bomber plant, which had of factory space, and an aircraft assembly line over a mile (1600 m) long. It was thought to be the largest factory under one roof anywhere in the world. The Willow Run plant featured a large turntable two- thirds of the way along the assembly line, allowing the B-24 production line to make a 90¬∞ turn before continuing to final assembly. According to legend, this arrangement allowed the company to pay taxes on the entire plant (and its equipment) to Washtenaw County, and avoid the higher taxes of Wayne County where the airfield is located; overhead views suggest that avoiding encroachment on the airfield's taxiways was also a motivation.Weber, Austin. \\"A Historical Perspective.\\" Assembly Magazine, 2001. B-24 Production Employee housing crisis Even with people driving 100 miles or renting every spare room between Ann Arbor and Grosse Pointe, the sheer size of Willow Run led inevitably to a housing shortage. Because of the urgent need for shelter, the Federal Public Housing Administration took action and built temporary housing.  Willow Run Lodge and Village  The resulting housing complexes were built in several different groups. Willow Run Lodge was a series of dormitories for single people and was built on the land north of Michigan Avenue and south of Geddes Road. This covered 90 parcels of land totaling . In February 1943 the first dormitory (Willow Run Lodge) opened, consisted of fifteen buildings containing 1,900 rooms, some single- and others double-occupancy, with room for 3,000 people. Between June and December 1943, construction was completed on temporary \\"flat-top\\" buildings providing homes for 2,500 families. This section was known as Willow Run Village. The flat- tops contained four, six, or eight apartments with one, two, or three bedrooms. Also in the Willow Run Village were the \\"West Court\\" buildings, with peaked rooftops and space for couples or three adults. Of the 1,000 apartments in West Court, some had no bedrooms and were called \\"zero bedroom\\" apartments, and the rest had one bedroom. The first of these apartments were ready for occupancy in August 1943. Another large dormitory project, containing 1,960 rooms and known as West Lodge, was also ready for tenants at that time. By the end of 1943 there were six different temporary projects in the vicinity of Willow Run: two dormitory projects, two trailer projects (one renting trailers, and another for privately owned trailers; each with community laundry, shower, and toilet facilities), and two projects with apartments for couples or families, West Court and the Village. Between them, there was a shelter for more than 15,000 people, or roughly, the number of people living in Ypsilanti at the time.  Parkridge Homes  African American worker at Willow Run, July 1942 In addition to the Willow Run Lodge and Village housing projects, another community named Parkridge Homes was also built in 1943 to house African-American Willow Run employees. Efforts to desegregate Willow Run Lodge and Village and build additional integrated housing were rebuffed by the Detroit Housing Commission and the National Housing Agency, so noted African-American architect Hilyard Robinson was contracted to design an 80-unit community. The housing complex remained in use until 2016 as public housing when it was demolished and rebuilt with new modern units. In May of 2017, the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office recognized Parkridge Homes with the unveiling three historic markers signifying the importance to Ypsilanti history. Also constructed at this time was the Parkridge Community Center.  Sociological study on Willow Run housing crisis  Sociologist and professor Lowell Juilliard Carr and James Edson Stermer of the University of Michigan studied the sociological conditions at Willow Run arising from the wartime surge in the worker population in their book of 1952.* Carr, Lowell J., and Stermer, James Edison, Willow Run (Work, Its Rewards and Discontents): a Study of industrialization and Cultural Inadequacy, New York: Harper & Brothers, 1952. () They discuss \\"cultural inadequacy theory\\", stating that \\"industrial culture provides no criterion by which either a manufacturer or a government official can determine in advance when a manufacturer should divert his own capital to housing and other community services and when he shall rely on the capital of others for such facilities and services\\". Liberator production Despite intensive design efforts led by Ford production executive Charles E. Sorensen,. the opening of the plant still saw some mismanagement and bungling, and quality was uneven for some time. Although the Ford Trimotor had been a success in the 1920s, the company had since shied away from aviation, and initially, Ford was assigned to provide B-24 components with final assembly performed by Consolidated at its Fort Worth plant, or by fellow licensee Douglas Aircraft at its Tulsa, Oklahoma, plant. However, in October 1941 Ford received permission from Consolidated and the Army to assemble complete Liberators on its own at its new Willow Run facility. Even then it would take nearly a year before finished Liberators left the factory. According to Max Wallace, Air Corps Chief General \\"Hap\\" Arnold told Charles Lindbergh, then a consultant at the plant, that \\"combat squadrons greatly preferred the B-17 bomber to the B-24 because 'when we send the 17's out on a mission, most of them return. But when we send the 24's out, most of them don't.'\\"Wallace, Max. (2003). The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich. New York: St. Martin's Press. page 311 A 1943 committee authorized by Congress to examine problems at the plant issued a highly critical report; the Ford Motor Company had created a production line that too closely resembled an automobile assembly line \\"despite the warning of many experienced aircraftmen.\\"Wallace, page 312 Although the jumping of an automotive company into aircraft production posed these quality problems, it also brought remarkable production rates. The plant held the distinction of being the world's largest enclosed \\"room.\\" The first Ford-built Liberator rolled off the Willow Run line in September 1942; the first series of Willow Run Liberators was the B-24E. A small part of the world's largest one-story war production plant, the giant bomber factory at Willow Run, Michigan. Fixtures in background hold bomber wings during assembly, 1942 The Willow Run Plant had many initial startup problems, due primarily to the fact that Ford employees were used to automobile mass production and found it difficult to adapt these techniques to aircraft production. The plant at Willow Run was also beset with labor difficulties, high absentee rates, and rapid employee turnover. The factory was nearly an hour's drive from Detroit, and the imposition of wartime gasoline and tire rationing had made the daily commute difficult. In only one month, Ford had hired 2,900 workers but had lost 3,100. Also, Henry Ford was cantankerous and rigid in his ways. He was violently anti-union and there were serious labor difficulties, including a massive strike. In addition, Henry Ford refused on principle to hire women. However, he finally relented and did employ \\"Rosie the Riveters\\" on his assembly lines, probably more because so many of his potential male workers had been drafted into the military than due to any sudden change of principle on his part. By autumn 1943, the top leadership role at Willow Run had passed from Charles Sorensen to Mead L. Bricker.. At the request of the government, Ford began to decentralize operations and many parts were assembled at other Ford plants as well as by the company's sub- contractors, with the Willow Run plant concentrating on final aircraft assembly. The bugs were eventually worked out of the manufacturing processes, and by 1944, Ford was rolling a Liberator off the Willow Run production line every 63 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. At its peak monthly production (August 1944), Willow Run produced 428 B-24s with highest production listed as 100 completed Bombers flying away from Willow Run Between April 24 and April 26, 1944. By 1945, Ford produced 70% of the B-24s in two 9-hour shifts. Ford built 6,972 of the 18,482 total B-24s and produced kits for 1,893 more to be assembled by the other manufacturers. The B-24 holds the distinction of being the most produced heavy bomber in history. Army Air Forces support and post-production activities After their manufacture, the next step in the process was the delivery of the aircraft to the operational squadrons. This was done at Willow Run by 1st Concentration Command (1st CC). The 1st CC was responsible for completing the organization and equipment of tactical and combat bombardment squadrons prior to their deployment to the overseas combat theaters. It also provided a final inspection of the aircraft and made any appropriate final changes; i.e., install long-range fuel tanks, remove unnecessary equipment, and give it a final flight safety test.AFHRA Document 00155775 1 Concentration Command History While the planes were being serviced and made ready for overseas movement, personnel for these planes were also being processed. Pilots, co-pilots, navigators and crew chiefs were assigned as a crew for each aircraft, sleeping on 1,300 cots as they waited for the B-24s to roll off the assembly line. Paperwork was handled, necessary specific B-24 life support equipment was issued and some technical training for supporting the aircraft accomplished.AFHRA Document 00150138 AAFTC Technical Training Command Once production began, it became difficult to introduce changes dictated by field experience in the various overseas theaters onto the production line in a timely fashion. Consequently, newly constructed Liberators needed modifications for the specific geographic areas they were to be flown in combat. For this reason, a series of Air Technical Service Command modification centers were established for the incorporation of these required theater changes into new Liberators following their manufacture and assignments. There were seven known modification centers: the Birmingham Air Depot in Alabama; Consolidated's Fort Worth plant, the Oklahoma City Air Materiel Center at Tinker Field, the Tucson Modification Center at Tucson International Airport; the Northwest Airlines Depot in Minneapolis; the, Martin-Omaha manufacturing plant, and the Hawaiian Air Depot at Hickam Field. The Birmingham Air Depot's primary mission was modifying Liberators from Willow Run. Liberator variants produced at Willow Run The B-24E was the first variant of the B-24 that underwent primary manufacture by Ford at Willow Run. Not only did Ford build 490 complete planes, but it also supplied components of B-24Es as kits that could be trucked for final assembly at the factories of Consolidated in Fort Worth and Douglas in Tulsa, 144 and 167 kits. B-24E engine installation, Willow Run 1943 B-24Es built and fully assembled at Ford were designated B-24E-FO; those assembled at Tulsa and Fort Worth out of parts supplied by Ford were designated B-24E-DT and B-24E-CF respectively. Because of production delays encountered at Willow Run as a result of the inevitable difficulties and snags involved in the adaptation of automobile manufacturing techniques to aircraft, the B-24Es produced at Willow Run were, generally, obsolete by the time that it began to roll off the production lines, and most were relegated to training roles in the United States and hence few ever saw combat.Davis, Larry, (1987), B-24 Liberator in Action - Aircraft No. 80, Squadron/Signal Publications Inc. The B-24H was the first variant produced by Ford at Willow Run in large numbers that went into combat. The B-24H differed from earlier B-24s by having a second turret placed in the nose of the aircraft to increase defensive firepower. Because of the many structural changes required to accommodate the nose turret, the first B-24Hs were delivered slightly behind schedule, with the first machines rolling off the production lines at Ford in late June 1943. Production for the B-24H at Willow Run was 1,780. Upon the introduction of the B-24J, all three of the Liberator manufacturing plants converted to the production of this version. The B-24J incorporated a hydraulically driven tail turret and other defensive armament modifications in the nose of the aircraft. The bomber plant produced its first B-24J in April 1944; 1587 were built at Willow Run. During June 1944, the Army determined that the San Diego and Willow Run plants would be capable of meeting all future requirements for Liberator production. The Boeing B-29 Superfortress was taking over the long-range bombing role in the Pacific Theater and no new B-24 units were programmed for deployment in the other combat theaters of Europe, the Mediterranean or in the CBI. The B-24L was the first product of the new, downsized Liberator production pool. It was an attempt to reverse the trend toward ever-increasing weight of the Liberator as more and more armament, equipment, and armor had been added, with no corresponding increase in engine power. With the weight reduction and more powerful engines, it also had a much longer range than earlier models. 1250 B-24L aircraft were built at Willow Run. The B-24M was the last large-scale production variant of the Liberator. Apart from a new tail turret, the B-24M differed little from the B-24L. The first B-24Ms were delivered in October 1944, and by the end of its production in 1945, Willow Run had built 1677; 124 Ford-built B-24Ms were cancelled before delivery. Ford had switched over to the single-tailed B-24N in May 1945, but the end of the war in Europe in the same month brought a rapid end to Liberator production; the contract with Ford was officially terminated on 31 May 1945 and orders for 5168 unbuilt B-24N-FO bombers were cancelled as well. The delivery of seven YB-24Ns by Ford in June 1945 marked the end of Liberator production at Willow Run.Johnson, Fredrick A (1996) Consolidated B-24 Liberator - Warbird Tech Vol. 1, Specialty Press. Post-war conversion Although Ford had an option to purchase the plant once it was no longer needed for war production, the company declined to exercise it, and ended its association with Willow Run. Kaiser takes control Kaiser-Frazer C-119 built at Willow Run After Ford declined to purchase the plant, it was sold to the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation, a partnership of construction and shipbuilding magnate Henry J. Kaiser and Graham-Paige executive Joseph W. Frazer. The plant produced both Kaiser and Frazer (automobile) models, including the compact Henry J, which with minor differences was also sold through Sears-Roebuck as the Allstate. Willow Run produced 739,000 cars as part of Kaiser-Frazer and Kaiser Motors, from 1947 through 1953, when after years of losses, the company (now called Kaiser Motors after Frazer's exit from the partnership) purchased Willys-Overland and began moving its production at Willow Run to the Willys plant in Toledo, Ohio. Although Willow Run is synonymous with the Liberator bomber, B-24s were not the only planes manufactured at Willow Run. As the US Air Force struggled to expand its airlift capacity during the Korean War, Kaiser-Frazer built C-119 Flying Boxcar cargo planes at Willow Run under license from Fairchild Aircraft, producing an estimated 88 C-119s between 1951 and 1953. Kaiser also built two C-123 Provider airframes at Willow Run, which were scrapped before delivery, as a procurement scandal involving the company put an end to any chance for future Air Force contracts. General Motors operations Later in 1953, after a fire on August 12 destroyed General Motors' Detroit Transmission factory in Livonia, Michigan, the Willow Run complex was first leased to GM, and eventually sold to it, with the salvaged Hydramatic transmission tooling and machinery relocated to Willow Run, and put back into production just nine weeks after the fire.Kidder, Warren Benjamin, Willow Run, Colossus of American Industry Michigan:KFT,1995 1976 Chevrolet Nova built in Willow Run Over the years, GM expanded the bomber plant by roughly half, into a nearly GM Powertrain factory and engineering center; a parcel of land to the south of Powertrain was set aside for assembly operations that began in 1959, including a Fisher Body plant that built bodies for the Chevrolet models assembled there, including the Corvair and Nova. In 1968, General Motors began reorganizing its body and assembly operations into the GM Assembly Division (GMAD). GMAD required 16 years to completely absorb Fisher Body's operations, and Fisher would manufacture bodies at Willow Run Assembly until the 1970s; vehicles would roll off the line there until 1992. In addition to making automatic transmissions, Willow Run Transmission also produced the M16A1 rifle and the M39A1 20mm autocannon for the US military during the Vietnam War. By the time General Motors entered bankruptcy in 2009, manufacturing and assembly operations at Willow Run had dwindled to almost nothing; the GM Powertrain plant closed in December 2010 and the complex passed into the control of the RACER Trust, which is charged with cleaning up, positioning for redevelopment and ultimately, selling properties of the former General Motors. MARC and Willow Run Laboratories On the other side of the airport from the assembly plant were a group of World War II hangars, which were sold to the University of Michigan in 1946. The university operated the Michigan Aeronautical Research Center (MARC), later known as Willow Run Laboratories (WRL), from 1946 to 1972 at Willow Run. MARC and WRL produced many innovations, including the first ruby laser and operation of the ruby maser, as well as early research into antiballistic missile defense and advanced remote sensing. In 1972, the University spun off WRL into the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, which eventually left Willow Run for offices in Ann Arbor. Redevelopment efforts and the Yankee Air Museum The airfield, owned by the Wayne County Airport Authority since 2004, continues to operate as the Willow Run Airport and is primarily used for cargo and general aviation flights. The Yankee Air Museum resides on the airport grounds, occupying as of April 2013 a hangar and other properties. For a period of time before the eventual demolition of Willow Run Assembly, portions were used as a warehouse, about a quarter of which was leased by GM as a facility for parts distribution. In April 2013, the Detroit Free Press confirmed that the facility's current owner, RACER Trust, was negotiating with the Yankee Air Museum to preserve a small portion of the original bomber plant as a new home for the museum. Yankee was originally granted until August 2013 (deadline was later extended) to raise the funds needed to purchase and separate a portion of the approximately 5,000,000 sq. ft. building, which later became the GM Powertrain facility. The museum would consolidate operations scattered on various parcels at Willow Run, and the Trust expects to clear the remainder of the plant for redevelopment. The portion of the original bomber plant that Yankee seeks to preserve is less than 5% of the massive facility, comprises the end of the former B-24 assembly line at the far eastern edge of the property, and contains the two iconic bay doors from which the finished Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers exited the plant during World War II. The campaign to save a portion of Willow Run for the Yankee Air Museum was called SaveTheBomberPlant.org, and is centered on a fundraising website by the same name.Save The Bomber Plant ‚Äì Information and fundraising site for Yankee Air Museum's effort to save a portion of the Willow Run Bomber Plant The campaign attracted national, and even international, attention from media outlets that include many major news dailies in the US as well as National Public Radio, The History Channel magazine, National Geographic TV, The Guardian and the Daily Mail, both of the UK. Building owner RACER Trust extended the original fundraising deadline (August 1, 2013) a total of three times since the Yankee Air Museum launched its SaveTheBomberPlant.org campaign. The first two extensions were to October 1, 2013, and then to November 1, 2013. On October 26, 2013, RACER Trust and the Yankee Air Museum again reached a third, and final, deadline extension agreement that gave Yankee until May 1, 2014, to raise the $8 million estimated as necessary to secure, enclose and preserve a portion of the original Willow Run plant for the Yankee Air Museum. The majority of the $8 million goal reflects separation costs to make the preserved portion of the plant viable as a standalone structure. RACER Trust has been supportive of the campaign, even reconfiguring engineering and demolition plans to save cost for the museum. At the time of the May 1, 2014, deadline, the Yankee Air Museum had raised over $7 million of its original $8 million fundraising goal, which was enough to enable the building's owners to move forward with signing a Purchase Agreement with Yankee, with the actual purchase expected to be finalized in late summer or fall of 2014. Meanwhile, the remaining portion of the Willow Run property, which includes over 95% of the historic original bomber plant building, was optioned to Walbridge, Inc., for redevelopment as a connected car research and test facility. The option to Walbridge has since lapsed and the property remains available for purchase and redevelopment. Decommision and demolition GM Service and Parts Operations, 2011 Michigan Live reporter Amy Biolchini toured the empty Willow Run facility in early 2013, observing: Part of the tour led them to a hidden room within the facility: Demolition of the majority of the Willow Run facility began in December 2013. The Yankee Air Museum was able to gain control of approximately 144,900 square feet of the plant and has plans to develop a permanent home for the museum. By mid-2014, the majority of the facility had been demolished and cleared.

Rutgers University was named after him, and he donated a bond which placed the college on sound financial footing. He also gave a bell that is still in use today. Early life Rutgers was born in New York City, in the Province of New York which was then a part of British America. He was the son of New Netherland colonists Hendrick Rutgers and Catharine (n√©e DePeyster) Rutgers. His maternal grandparents were Johannes de Peyster, the 23rd Mayor of New York City, and Anna (n√©e Bancker) de Peyster, the sister of Evert Bancker, the 3rd and 12th Mayor of Albany, New York. His paternal grandparents were Harmanus Rutgers and Rachel (n√©e Meyers) Rutgers, herself a granddaughter of Claes Martenszen van Rosenvelt, the first Roosevelt to arrive in America. Through his father's sister, he was a first cousin of Samuel Provoost, the first Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. He was a third cousin twice removed of both U.S. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roosevelt_family He graduated from King's College (now Columbia University) in 1766. Career Following his graduation, he promptly became an advocate for independence of the American colonies from Great Britain. He went on to serve as a captain of American forces at the Battle of White Plains, and later as a colonel for the New York militia. His home served as a barracks during the British occupation of New York in 1776. Colonel Rutgers would continue to play a role in the defense of the young nation after the Revolution, presiding over a meeting held June 24, 1812 to organize American forces in New York in anticipation of a British attack in the ensuing War of 1812. Politics and public life The bronze bell donated by Henry Rutgers hangs in the cupola of Old Queens In 1783, Colonel Rutgers was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he served in the 7th New York State Legislature. He also served on the New York Board of Education Regents from 1802 to 1826. He was a Presidential Elector, chosen by the legislature, in 1808, 1816, and 1820. Rutgers supported the American Colonization Society, arguing against abolitionists that free people of color should be removed from the United States rather than allowed to grow as a population. He was himself a slaveowner, like many of his relatives. In his later years, Rutgers, a bachelor, devoted much of his fortune to philanthropy. As a landowner with considerable holdings on the island of Manhattan (especially in the vicinity of Chatham Square), he donated land for the use of schools, churches, and charities in the area. Both Henry Street and Rutgers Street in lower Manhattan are named for him, as well as the Rutgers Presbyterian Church (formerly the Collegiate Presbyterian Church) which was also named for Colonel Rutgers who donated the parcel of land at the corner of Henry Street and Rutgers Street on which the original church was built in 1798. Colonel Rutgers' most lasting legacy however, is due to his donations to Queen's College in New Brunswick, New Jersey, which at the time was suffering considerable financial difficulties and temporarily closed. The college had been founded as a seminary for the Reformed Church in America and appealed to Colonel Rutgers, a devout member of the church with a reputation for philanthropy, for aid. Rutgers donated a bond valued at $5000 to reopen the faltering school, and subsequently donated a bronze bell that was hung in the cupola of the Old Queens building which housed the college. In gratitude, and hoping the college would be remembered in the Colonel's will, the trustees renamed it Rutgers College on December 5, 1825. (Colonel Rutgers left nothing to the college upon his death.) The institution later became \\"Rutgers University,\\" then \\"Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey\\". Death and legacy Henry Rutgers died in New York City, at the age of 84. Rutgers was initially buried in the Reformed Church on Nassau Street (the same church in which he was baptized). However, as cemeteries in Manhattan were redeveloped during the mid-1800s, the Colonel‚Äôs body was re-interred several times (first moved in 1858 to the Middle Church in Lafayette Place, on the corner of Nassau Street and Cedar Street in Manhattan, and then, in 1865, interred in Green- Wood Cemetery). For many years, no one remembered where his body had been finally laid to rest, although it was long believed that he was buried in a Dutch Reformed churchyard in Belleville, New Jersey. One road running alongside this New Jersey graveyard is now called Rutgers Street (signed as, but not technically part of, Route 7). Misplaced by history for over 140 years, Henry Rutgers' final \\"final resting place\\" was rediscovered in October 2007Source: contemporaneous personal correspondence with the Civil War research volunteers (including Mark & Stephanie Carey, two Rutgers alums) who found the Colonel's re-burial record while searching for Civil War veteran/casualty burial records. They notified the Cemetery historian, who worked with Rutgers historians & the Veterans' Administration to ensure that the Colonel's burial place was properly marked and recorded. by Civil War research volunteers sifting through burial records of the historical Green- Wood Cemetery. In 1865, Rutgers' body had been finally laid to rest in an unmarked grave (he is interred in Lot 10776, Sec. 28, in an underground vault) within the Dutch Reformed Church's plot at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. The Green-Wood Historic Fund and members of the Rutgers Community honored the Colonel‚Äôs memory on Flag Day, June 14, 2008 by unveiling a bronze marker at his gravesite. Elsewhere in Green-Wood Cemetery lies the grave of Mabel Smith Douglass, founder and first dean of the New Jersey College for Women (renamed Douglass College in her honor), the former women‚Äôs college associated with Rutgers University.

It is situated on the Denniston Plateau, 600 metres (2000 feet) above sea level in the Papahaua Ranges. During the first few decades of the 20th Century, up to 1400 people lived in the townships on the Denniston Plateau to service the large coal mines there. Coal was transported in railway wagons from the plateau via the Denniston Incline to Conns Creek, where steam locomotives of New Zealand Railways took coal trains to the port of Westport. The Denniston Incline closed in 1967. The plateau now has a population of fewer than 10 people, and virtually all the buildings and structures have gone, although many historical relics remain ‚Äì scattered throughout the plateau and incline area amongst the scrub vegetation. There are proposals for future mining on the Denniston Plateau. Overview Top of Denniston Incline in 2013 The townships of the Denniston Plateau, and the Denniston Incline itself, existed solely to extract coal from the plateau. Living conditions at Denniston were harsh; the rocky, windswept plateau is often immersed in cloud, receives a high annual rainfall, and very low temperatures are common. Once good road access to the plateau was established and the demand for coal declined, the townships shrank ‚Äì and disappeared altogether once the incline and mines closed. A former schoolhouse, now used as a museum, is one of the few buildings remaining. Very few people now live on the plateau but the area is of increasing interest to tourists interested in its history. Future opencast mining is a possibility. The setting and history of Denniston is similar to that of Millerton, located on a similar plateau 12 kilometres (7 miles) to the north. History The Westport Coal Company The Westport Colliery Company, predecessor to the Westport Coal Company, was formed in 1878 to mine the high quality coal on the Mount Rochfort Plateau, commonly known as the Denniston Plateau. To access the coal, the company extended the nearby Wellington Coal Company's branch railway on the south bank of the Waimangaroa River by 1.1 kilometres (0.7 miles) to Conns Creek, and constructed the Denniston Incline, and the roperoads from the mines to the top of the incline.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), p. 19. To raise additional capital to develop the mines further, the Westport Colliery Company was reformed into the Westport Coal Company in 1881. The company also operated mines in other places on the West Coast, including Millerton, and by 1905, the company was by far the largest coal producer in New Zealand. The Westport Coal Company's mines and the Denniston Incline were taken over by the New Zealand State Mines Department in 1948.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), p. 29. Denniston incline Bottom of Denniston Incline, c.1880s-90s. The Denniston Incline began operation in April 1880. It was a self-acting ropeway that used gravity to lower 12.5 ton gross laden weight New Zealand Railways' coal wagons one at a time from Brakehead, at Denniston, at the top to Conns Creek below. Each descending wagon hauled an empty one up the incline by means of wire ropes, each wagon attached to its own rope and brake drum. The two drums were mounted beside each other on a common shaft, and the wire rope wound in opposite directions on each drum. So while one drum was letting the rope out and lowering a full wagon down the incline, the other drum was winding its rope in and pulling an empty wagon up the incline. Hydraulic pistons slowed the rotation of the winding drums to control the speed of the wagons.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), pp. 42-43. The Denniston Incline was actually two inclines. The higher of the two began at Brakehead, and descended steeply to the appropriately named Middle Brake. Here wagons were disconnected from the first incline's rope, and placed on the rope of the second incline for a more gentle descent to Conns Creek, where the accumulated wagons would then be marshalled into trains before being taken to Westport.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008). pp. 50-61. The drum from Middle Brake is now on display at Westport's Coaltown Museum.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), p. 91. The upper part of each incline had essentially two sets of railway tracks side by side (three rails, with the inner rail shared by both tracks), while below the midsection of each incline (where wagons passed each other) the two sets of track were 'interwoven'.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), pp. 45-46. Each side of the inclines alternately had wagons ascending and descending ‚Äì otherwise the ropes would get crossed over. (An image of a full wagon descending the upper part of one incline can be seen below in External links.) The southern side of the inclines was called the 'Company Side', as that was the side the company offices were located on; the northern side of the inclines was called the 'Donkey Side'. The system did not always function as intended and collisions, derailments and runaways were not unknown.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), pp. 62-63. The remains of several wrecked wagons still lie beside, or even some distance from, the incline formation.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), p. 61. The Denniston incline fell a total of 516 metres (1,694 feet) in 1,670 metres (83 chains or 1.04 miles), with some sections having gradients steeper than 1 in 1.3. (The short-lived Koranui Incline on the other side of the valley was higher, with a total fall of 700 metres (2,300 feet), and over twice as long as the Denniston Incline, with a length of 3.6 kilometres (2.2 miles).) Wagons could be delivered from Denniston to Conns Creek at a rate of 12 to 18 wagons per hour.Petchey, P. G .(2007), p. 16. The track gauge was the standard NZR track gauge of . The railway wagons used on the incline were mainly the common \\"Q\\" class hopper wagons, the hoppers of which could be detached from their wagon bodies and lifted by wharf crane over the hold of a ship, and the bottom discharge doors of the wagons then opened manually to discharge coal into the ships' holds. (Two images of a crane lifting a hopper out of a wagon and over a ship's hold can be seen below in External links.) The mines and roperoads The mines on the Denniston Plateau included the Banbury, Ironbridge, Coalbrookdale, Whareatea, and Sullivan mines.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008). pp. 33, 38. The first mine was the Banbury, which began production in 1880. A double track 2 ft (0.61m) gauge 560-metre long horse tramway was built from the top of the incline to the Banbury Mine above the Waimangaroa Gorge to carry coal from the mine to the top of the incline.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), p. 23. Later, horse-power was replaced by a steam engine-powered moving endless rope to which mine tubs were hooked by chains for their journeys to and from the bins at Brakehead. By 1889, the double track tramway (now called a roperoad) had been extended through and beyond the Banbury Mine, past the Ironbrook Mine and on to the Coalbrookdale Mine‚Äîa distance of about 2.4 kilometres (1.5 miles). The roperoad system was renewed along a partly new alignment between 1900 and 1904.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), pp. 29, 33. (An image of one of these roperoads can be seen below in External links.) In 1952, a monocable aerial ropeway 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) in length was commissioned (with buckets carrying coal suspended from the rope) to carry coal from the new Whareata and Sullivan mines to Brakehead, and the roperoad was abandoned.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), p. 38. The Coalbrookdale and Ironbridge mines had reached the end of their economic lives and closed in 1944 and 1945 respectively; Banbury Mine had closed in 1890.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), p. 8. The Westport Coal Company's coal production from the Denniston Plateau increased to an annual peak in 1910, when 464 men working underground produced 348,335 tons of coal. Production then declined.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008). p. 34. In all, the incline carried an estimated 12.6 million tons of coal during its life.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), p. 47. Some mining continued and the Escarpment Mine operated from 1964 to 1982. The townships and people There were three main townships on the Denniston Plateau ‚Äì Denniston, Burnett's Face, and Coalbrookdale.Petchey, P. G. (2007), pp. 50-80. There were no roads connecting the townships, and everyone walked alongside the roperoads to move about.Hawes, C. (2004), p. 111. The population of the plateau as a whole peaked in 1911, at just over 1400 inhabitants (the population of Denniston township peaked later, in 1926). Denniston The first settlement, known as \\"The Camp\\", was located on a rock ledge above the Waimangaroa River. It was built below the level of the plateau between two escarpments for protection from relentless winds. The first workers developed the Banbury Mine, but many did not stay long owing to the inhospitable conditions. However, by 1883 there were about a hundred residents, a school, and a brass band. The company's offices were above The Camp and Brakehead, alongside the tramway from the mine to the top of the incline.Hawes, C, (2004), pp. 106-108.Petchey, P. G. (2007), pp.50-57. A bridle track was built between Waimangaroa and Denniston by 1885.Petchey, P. G. (2007), p.50. Prior to this, the only access for people and goods had been to ride in coal wagons travelling at high speed up or down the incline.Hawes, C. (2004), p. 109. Settlement soon spread up onto the plateau itself, and by 1887 there were three hotels, a postal and telegraph office, four general stores, three butchers and three bakers in Denniston. Living conditions were squalid and visitors complained about the unsanitary and 'smelly' nature of the township. The cottages were utilitarian small wooden buildings with roofs and chimneys of corrugated iron. There was no running water, no baths in houses, and toilets were tin sheds with cans that were emptied by night cart men. Large families were often confined to two-room huts for long periods during bad weather. There were no shrubs flowers or gardens. Even after 20 years, these poor living conditions still prevailed.Hawes, C. (2004), p. 112-113. Denniston played a key role in the development of the union movement in New Zealand, and the country's first miner's union was formed at Denniston in 1884.Petchey, P. G. (2007), p. 11. A report to the coal industry in 1919 attributed much of the industrial unrest and dissatisfaction of the Deniston miners to their 'sordid' living conditions. Denniston had a communal recreation and sports ground, its own sports clubs and Returned Services Association, and churches included Presbyterian, Methodist, Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Salvation Army.Hawes, C. (2004), p. 112. There were five lodges (Masonic, Druids, Odd Fellows, Orange and Buffaloes). In the days before social welfare, in an isolated community on low hourly wages, churches, unions, friendly societies and lodges provided important security for their members. Miners had formed their own Medical Association in 1883 (a doctor was contracted to visit Denniston twice a week) and an Accident and Relief Fund Association was formed in 1890.Hawes, C. (2004), p. 108. A hospital, which opened in 1910 ‚Äì paid for by subscriptions, levies and fundraising efforts ‚Äì was built in a central location to deal with emergencies from mines in all directions.Hawes, C. (2004), pp. 111-112. Denniston did not have a cemetery as the ground was too hard; bodies were transported from Denniston to Waimangaroa for burial, initially down the Denniston Incline and later by road.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), pp. 29, 84. The peak of population came in 1926, when there were 910 living in the township. During the 1932-35 Depression, and after World War 2, people began to move away from Denniston, with many houses being moved in sections for re-erection at Waimangaroa or Westport. For the remaining workers, the provision of buses enabled them and their families to live in more pleasant conditions down on the coastal plain. The school, last shop, and last hotel (the Red Dog Saloon, owned by Johnny Cotter) closed in the 1960s, and the Post Office closed in 1971.Petchey, P. G. (2007), p. 51. The last lodge, the Buffaloes Lodge, closed in 1996 ‚Äì though by then it had relocated from Denniston to the former Waimangaroa RSA rooms. Burnett's Face The coal-mining settlement of Burnett's Face (circa 1910) The development of the Ironbridge Mine led to the establishment of the settlement known as Burnett's Face, about 2 kilometres southeast from Denniston. It was initially a cluster of tents, but by 1891 there were wooden cottages, a school, two hotels, a butchery, a bakery, several stores, two halls, and two billiard saloons.Hawes, C. (2004), p. 110. Its main road was the constantly running roperoad skipway linking the mine with the bins at the head of the Denniston Incline. By the 1950s, little remained of the settlement. Coalbrookdale Another township, Coalbrookdale, stretched for several hundred metres along sides of the roperoad in the lower Coalbrookdale Valley, southwest of Burnett's Face. There were about 21 buildings in Coalbrookdale in 1891, and the population peaked in 1896 when there were 165 people living in the valley. There was a licensed hotel from 1894 to c.1921. The last permanent resident departed in 1956.Petchey, P. G. (2007), pp. 63, 65. Decline and closure The community at Denniston served no other purpose than to support the operations of the coal mines and the incline. Once a usable road was put through from Waimangaroa to the plateau, people started to drift away from the plateau to the warmer climate of Waimangaroa or Westport below. By the 1960s, demand for coal was falling and the Denniston Incline closed on 16 August 1967. The Conns Creek branch, which connected to the foot of the incline, was cut back to become a 1 kilometre (0.6-mile) long spur siding where the coal carried by truck from the bins at Brakehead was transferred into railway wagons. A few months later, in 1968, the aerial ropeway from the mines also closed in favour of trucking of coal down the hill directly from the mines. In May 1968, the Inangahua earthquake caused much damage to the incline, making the closure irreversible.Prebble, B. (Ed.) (2008), pp. 40-41. Thus, what was once described as the \\"Eighth Wonder of the World\\" by locals, faded into history. Denniston Plateau today Heritage preservation Little remains of the Incline or the townships on the plateau but relics can be found throughout the area.Petchey, P. G. (2007), pp. 18-80. Middle Brake is one of the most intact industrial areas remaining because its inaccessibility resulted in much equipment being left on site.Petchey, P. G. (2007), p. 26. At Brakehead and Denniston township, the main street grid, building foundations, chimneys, and the square water tanks that many houses had, are the main relics that can be seen. Most of the former building sites are empty and covered in low scrub and only a few buildings still stand.Petchey, P. G. (2007), p. 57. The former high school is occupied by the Friends of the Hill and is used as a museum and information centre. Other remaining buildings are now privately owned. Denniston is listed as a Category 1 Historic Place on the New Zealand Heritage List, and considered to have special or outstanding historical or cultural significance or value. The Denniston Incline and the key historical areas of the plateau are now managed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. At Brakehead, replicas have been built of some of the former trackwork and three original Q wagons placed on the site.Petchey, P. G. (2007), pp. 1, 5. With recognition of the historic nature of Denniston and its increasing status as a local tourist icon and one that is close to Westport, a group of mainly locals, The Friends of the Hill, seek to preserve Denniston's heritage and interpret it for the benefit of people visiting one of New Zealand's most famous coalfield settlements.Petchey, P. G. (2007), p. 2. The growth of interest in Denniston has been aided by The Denniston Rose, an historical novel by Jenny Pattrick, set in the 1880s at Denniston. Future mining Coal is still mined on the Denniston Plateau, at a small scale, and 9 kilometres (6 miles) to the north at the Stockton Mine near Millerton. In 2010 Bathurst Resources announced the Escarpment Mine Project to mine for coal on the Denniston Plateau, a move strongly opposed by environmentalists. In March 2013 the Environment Court gave Bathurst the go-ahead, though groups such as Forest & Bird vowed to continue fighting.

It was produced under license in France as the Hispano-Suiza 9V or Hispano-Wright 9V, and in the Soviet Union as the Shvetsov M-25. Design and development The R-1820 Cyclone 9 represented a further development of the Wright P-2 engine dating back to 1925. Featuring a greater displacement and a host of improvements, the R-1820 entered production in 1931. The engine remained in production well into the 1950s. The R-1820 was built under license by Lycoming, Pratt & Whitney Canada, and also, during World War II, by the Studebaker Corporation. The Soviet Union had purchased a license for the design, and the Shvetsov OKB was formed to metricate the American specification powerplant for Soviet government-factory production as the M-25, with the R-1820's general design features used by the Shvetsov design bureau for many of their future radials for the Soviet air forces through the 1940s and onwards. In Spain the R-1820 was license-built as the Hispano-Suiza 9V or Hispano-Wright 9V.Lage(2004) pp. 157-162 The R-1820 was at the heart of many famous aircraft including early Douglas airliners (the prototype DC-1, the DC-2, the first civil versions of the DC-3, and the limited-production DC-5), every wartime example of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Douglas SBD Dauntless bombers, the early versions of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter (as the M-25), and the Piasecki H-21 helicopter. The R-1820 also found limited use in armoured vehicles. The G-200 variant developed at 2,300 rpm and powered the strictly experimental M6 Heavy Tank.

The Vautour was operated by France's Arm√©e de l'Air, having been originally developed by Sud Aviation in response to a French requirement for a jet aircraft for bombing, low-level attack and all-weather interception operations. The Vautour was used in the Force de frappe under the Commandement des Forces A√©riennes Strat√©giques; each aircraft was suitable for the carriage of a nuclear weapon. The shortcomings of the type as a bomber, such as its lack of radar or other advanced navigation/attack systems, led to the type being replaced by the more capable Dassault Mirage IV. The Vautour never saw combat use with the French Air Force. The only other customer for the Vautour was Israel. During its service with the Israeli Air Force (IAF), the type undertook various mission and roles and was quickly used in combat. Vautours were used during the wars between Israel and its neighbors, including the Six-Day War and the War of Attrition. Only one air-to-air kill was recorded by a Vautour; the type was used more for bombing and ground strafing and was reportedly considered by Israel to be comparable to the Soviet-built Ilyushin Il-28 medium bombers used by its regional adversaries. During the early 1970s, the Vautour was replaced by the American Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. Development Origins In the aftermath of the Second World War, France set about the rebuilding and modernisation of its armed forces. In regards to aviation, this task had been made substantially more difficult due to setbacks incurred by the German occupation of France during the conflict; nearly all aircraft factories had been destroyed while individual design teams had scattered, meaning that there was little to no continuity of work and that the nation would be basically starting from scratch. Additionally, France had little technical knowledge or operational know-how with the newly developed field of jet propulsion in comparison to other powers, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. A major step towards bridging this gap was a licensing arrangement between Hispano-Suiza and British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Limited, under which the former would manufacture the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine; accordingly, the majority of early French jet aircraft were powered by the Nene while an indigenous engine was to be developed in the form of the Snecma Atar engine. During June 1951, the French Arm√©e de l'Air (AdA) issued a detailed requirement for a jet-powered aircraft capable of functioning in several roles, including as a bomber, a low-level attack aircraft, or an all- weather interceptor. In response to this requirement, French aircraft manufacturer SNCASO decided to adapt its existing S.O. 4000 design so that it could perform the desired missions roles. During 1951, test flight of the S.O.4000 prototype had demonstrated promising performance for the type, supporting the decision to proceed with a further development of the design.\\"IAF Aircraft Inventory: Sud-Ouest S.O. 4050 Vautour.\\" Jewish Virtual Library, Retrieved: 16 September 2017. According to aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, \\"It would be fair to claim that in the early 1950s the Vautour was the most promising twin-jet warplane in Western Europe\\".Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 125. An initial order for three prototypes was placed by the AdA. On 16 October 1952, the first prototype of the revised design, which had been designated as the S.O. 4050, conducted its maiden flight.Gunston 1981, p. 215. The flight test programme proceeded relatively smoothly; during one early flight, a prototype was recorded as having exceeded Mach 1 during a shallow dive. A follow-on order for six pre- production aircraft was soon received; one of these was powered by a pair of Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire engines while another was furnished with Rolls- Royce Avon engines, both British designs, while the remainder were powered by the French Atar engine. Subsequent production aircraft would use the Atar engine, having proven to be sufficiently mature and, with the aid of water injection, capable of sufficient power to enable the Vautour to take off while carrying a full payload.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 125‚Äì126. Production and further development Vautour II, the aircraft was manufactured in three distinct variants. During 1958, the aircraft entered service with the AdA; the Vautour would remain in use by the AdA for several decades. While the final French aircraft being retired from frontline service during 1979, a number were retained and soldiered on in various secondary duties into the early 1980s. The Vautour ultimately saw no combat usage during its service with the AdA; throughout the majority of its service life, the type was maligned as obsolete and relatively underpowered. Although it had been a moderately competent aircraft when it had been originally developed, the Vautour never benefitted from the adoption of sufficiently powerful engines, even though suitable powerplants did become available over time. As an interceptor, it was soon outclassed by the newer Dassault Mirage III, while in its roles either as a bomber or attack aircraft, the lack of an advanced navigation/attack system became a crippling limitation upon its effectiveness. The only export customer for the Vautour was Israel, who had chosen to procure a number of other types of combat aircraft from France as well. During the 1950s, France and Israel closely cooperated on various areas of defence, including armaments, aviation, and nuclear research.Crosbie 2015, pp. 109‚Äì115. According to author Sylvia K. Crosbie, a major motivating factor in the Israeli decision to procure the Vautour was to make a political statement to the country's neighbours, viewing the aircraft as a counterpart, and a response, to the Soviet-built Ilyushin Il-28 medium bombers, which had been acquired by Egypt.Crosbie 2015, pp. 113‚Äì114. During 1956, two years prior to the Vautour even entering squadron service, France had issued a more demanding requirement for a supersonic replacement aircraft. The Vautour was used as a stop-gap measure as the airborne carrier of France's independent nuclear deterrent while the more capable follow-on aircraft was being selected and developed; its performance in this role was typically thought to be limited at best. While the newer bomber requirement would ultimately result in the selection, development and manufacture of the Dassault Mirage IV bomber; Sud Aviation had also chose to respond to the requirement, producing their own proposal for the production of an envisioned Super Vautour. According to aviation author Bill Gunston, the unbuilt 'stretched' Super Vautour variant would have featured an increased combat radius of 1,700 miles as well as the ability to attain at least Mach 0.9.Gunston 1973, p. 104. Design Vautour II N The Sud Aviation Vautour was a jet-propelled mid-sized combat aircraft, typically employed as a bomber and attack aircraft, as well as having some usage as an interceptor. In terms of its basic configuration, it had a shoulder-wing monoplane configuration, furnished with a 35¬∞ swept wing and a \\"flying\\" tail. Power was provided by a pair of SNECMA Atar 101 turbojet engines, which were carried in pods located underneath the wings. The Vautour was equipped with a bicycle-type landing gear configuration in which the main units were located upon the underside of the fore and aft fuselage, these were augmented by smaller stabilizing gear set into bottom of the engine pods. The internal space of the central fuselage was largely dedicated to a large 5.0 meter (16 ft 5 in) weapons bay, along with substantial internal fuel tankage.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 124‚Äì125. The Vautour IIB bomber lacked any sort of radar arrangement or many of the contemporary navigational aids and attack systems that were installed upon several aircraft performing the same role during this era. Aiming of the armaments was performed by a bombardier, who would principally perform his bomb-aiming function using a Second World War-vintage American-built Norden bombsight. The navigator/bombardier position was within the nose section, which was glazed to provide external visibility. Both the Vautour IIB and IIA models were restricted to performing missions only under clear-weather operations during daylight. The Vantour IIN interceptor model was not as restrictive, having some capacity to conduct both nighttime and adverse weather operations, having been furnished with a radar system. During its service in Israel, where the weather of the local climate was generally favorable and daylight missions commonplace, the Vautour's lack of advanced targeting and navigation equipment was found to be not a crippling limitation. However, when operated in Europe, these restrictions were considered to be a major disadvantage. As a result, the French AdA never deployed their single- seat Vautour IIA fleet in a frontline capacity; the majority of its IIB bombers were quickly converted to the improved Vautour IIBR standard, which was used to perform photo reconnaissance missions instead. The Vautour was capable of being equipped with various armaments. In Israeli service, it was typically armed with a pair of 30 mm cannons, as well as up to four removable underwing rocket pods, containing up to 19 air-to-ground rockets each; up to 3,000lb of bombs or alternatively a maximum of 232 68 mm rockets could be accommodated internally in the bomb bay. 4,000lb of bombs could also be mounted externally.Hammel 2010, p. 128. The Vautour IIB bomber could be used to carry and deploy nuclear weapons in addition to its conventional arsenal. The internal bomb bay of a single aircraft could contain either one AN-11 or one AN-22 nuclear bomb; however, in AdA service, the primary carrier of nuclear weapons would quickly be transitioned to the newer and more capable Dassault Mirage IV, which supplemented and eventually replace the Vautour IIB bomber.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 126. Operational history Originally, the AdA had intended to order a total of 440 Vautours, comprising 300 of the IIA model and 140 of the IIN variant. However, plans were modified; ultimately no Vautour IIAs would enter AdA service and around 30 were believed to be constructed, 18 of which being sold to Israel at a relatively low price. In place of the IIA, the Vautour IIB was procured instead, which was suitable for performing level bombing runs across all altitudes, as well as the low altitude toss bombing attack profile. To address a deficiency of the Vautour that had been determined mid-service life, this being its limited range in comparison to contemporary strategic bombers, considerable emphasis was placed upon the introduction and perfection of aerial refueling techniques in the AdA. This led to the adoption of a 'buddy pack' to enable pairs of Vautours to refuel one another in mid-air, allowing for the range factor to be better addressed.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 126-127. A fleet of 40 AdA-operated Vautour IIBs constituted the original air-based component of the French force de frappe, the Commandement des Forces A√©riennes Strat√©giques (CFAS) of the French Air Force, which had been established during 1955.Gunston 1973, p. 105. However, their use in the strategic bomber role was determined to be less than optimal; allegedly, the Vautour's performance was commonly considered to be marginal and suitable for use as a stop gap measure at best. The deficiencies of the type contributed to France issuing a more stringent requirement calling for a new high performance bomber aircraft to be developed to perform the strategic mission. While efforts were made by Sud Aviation to design improved variants of the Vautour to conform with the new demands, the AdA opted to pursue rival aircraft company Dassault Aviation's proposal, which eventually resulted in the deployment of the Mirage IV, which eventually succeeded the Vautour in the bombing role in French service. As early as 1955, preliminary agreements for Israel's procurement of the Vautour were being drawn up and advanced plans being laid for its deployment.Crosbie 2015, p. 56. During early 1957, the type was officially selected to replace the British-built de Havilland Mosquito then in service the Israeli Air Force (IAF). On 1 August 1957, the first Vautour arrived in Israel, delivered secretly via French air bases in Tunisia and with AdA markings. The planes were delivered at a rate of 1 or 2 per month. Their entry into service had allegedly been delayed by several months due to political issues between Israel and France, which was resolved when permission to commence operations was granted by the latter.Crosbie 2015, p. 113. Deliveries of the type were completed in 1958. During August 1958, the existence of Israeli Vautours was publicly revealed in an air display. Crosbie described the Vautour as being \\"Israel's most important delivery system at the time\\", also observing the type to possess the capability to launch attacks upon the majority of Egyptian targets while carrying a payload of 6,000-8,000lb bombs. The IAF fielded a pair of squadrons equipped with the type. In Israeli service, the Vautour was used to perform many different roles, the IIN variant were initially tasked with night fighter operations, before transitioning to the attack role or being converted to perform aerial reconnaissance or electronic warfare operations. The Vautour proved to be quite capable as a reconnaissance aircraft; on 23 January 1962, one overflew right across Egypt to the Libyan border, evading repeated attempts at interception; during the following years, the type was used to gather evidence of Soviet-provided surface to air missiles (SAM)s present in Egypt. Likewise, in the electronic warfare mission, the aircraft proved effective at disabling Egyptian air defenses via onboard jamming equipment. In Israeli service, the Vautour had a relatively active combat career. As early as 1959, the type was being used against Egyptian targets; the Vautour would also participate in a series of actions throughout major conflicts between Israel and its neighbours, including the Six-Day War and the War of Attrition. Israeli Vautours were normally used to conduct bombing and strafing runs, along with several air-to-air engagements. During the Six-Day War, Israeli Vautours engaged in air-to-air combat with Iraqi Air Force aircraft while in the process of performing raiding missions against H-3 airfield in Iraq's western region. On 6 June 1967, Captain Ben-Zion Zohar scored the type's only aerial victory, having downed an Iraqi Hawker Hunter during one such engagement, although this did not mean the aircraft had a clear advantage over the latter, emphasized by a pair of Vautours being downed after having been struck by cannon fire from Iraqi Hunters on the following day.Aloni, Shlomo. \\"In a class of its own: The story of the Sud Aviation Vautour in Israeli Service.\\" Air Enthusiast, 72. November/December 1997. pp. 50‚Äì55. Overall, a total of 15 Vautours were recorded as having been lost in combat. Remaining examples of the type were retired during 1971 in favor of the American-built Douglas A-4 Skyhawk; the last aircraft left operational service during March 1972, their final role being decoy aircraft flown in the vicinity of the Sinai. The Israelis were pleased with the Vautour's range and versatility, and it was well regarded in Israeli service. Variants Vautour II A * S.O. 4050-01 : Two-seat all-weather fighter prototype, powered by two 23.5-kN (5,291-lb) Atar 101B turbojet engines. First flew on 16 October 1952.

Background The Wright Aeronautical Corporation was formed in 1919, initially to develop liquid- cooled Hispano-Suiza V8 engines under license. The Corporation's first original design, the R1, was also the first successful high-powered radial in the USA. Funded by contracts from the US Navy for new air-cooled radials, Wright started a new design (initially called the P2) in 1924. The resignation of Frederick Rentschler to form the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company, along with several key engineering personnel, seriously affected the development of the P2 and it did not go into production. Cyclone family R-1300 Cyclone 7 R-1750 Cyclone 9 A new design was launched in 1926, known as the R-1750 Cyclone. This was a nine-cylinder radial with a displacement of 1750 cu in and internally cooled exhaust valves. It was type-tested at 500 hp in 1927. R-1820 Cyclone 9 In 1932, the R-1750 was developed to a capacity of 1823 cu in. This was the F model Cyclone, designated R-1820. This engine introduced a forged aluminium crankcase and was developed through the 1930s to reach 890 hp. It used a General Electric supercharger, and Wright concluded that this feature limited the potential power output of the engine. For the next development, the G-Series of 1937, Wright developed its own single-speed supercharger. The G-series was developed to deliver 1200 hp at 2500 rpm and made up the bulk of R-1820 Cyclone production during World War 2. It was installed in the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. The final phase of development of the single-row radial design was the H-Series at 1350 hp. A licensed, metricated variant was developed as the Shvetsov M-25. R-2600 Cyclone 14 (Twin Cyclone) Wright went on to develop two-row engines with 14 cylinders in two rows of seven, called the Cyclone 14, R-2600. This was installed in the Boeing 314, Grumman TBM/TBF Avenger, North American B-25 Mitchell, and some models of the Douglas A-20 Havoc (RAF Boston). R-3350 Cyclone 18 (Duplex Cyclone) The penultimate Cyclone development was the 18-cylinder engine R-3350, named the Duplex Cyclone or Cyclone 18. Among other applications, it was installed in the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, Douglas A-1 Skyraider, Lockheed P-2 Neptune, and Lockheed C-121 Constellation. In commercial applications it stayed in production until 1957. R-4090 Cyclone 22 An experimental 22-cylinder two-row radial intended to compete with the large Pratt & Whitney radial engines. Three prototypes are known to have been built, but development was abandoned to allow resources to be used for the R-3350 development programme.

MyoD, which was discovered in the laboratory of Harold M. Weintraub, belongs to a family of proteins known as myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). These bHLH (basic helix loop helix) transcription factors act sequentially in myogenic differentiation. Vertebrate MRF family members include MyoD1, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4 (Myf6). In non-vertebrate animals, a single MyoD protein is typically found. MyoD is one of the earliest markers of myogenic commitment. MyoD is expressed at extremely low and essentially undetectable levels in quiescent satellite cells, but expression of MyoD is activated in response to exercise or muscle tissue damage. The effect of MyoD on satellite cells is dose- dependent; high MyoD expression represses cell renewal, promotes terminal differentiation and can induce apoptosis. Although MyoD marks myoblast commitment, muscle development is not dramatically ablated in mouse mutants lacking the MyoD gene. This is likely due to functional redundancy from Myf5 and/or Mrf4. Nevertheless, the combination of MyoD and Myf5 is vital to the success of myogenesis. History MyoD was cloned by a functional assay for muscle formation reported in Cell in 1987 by Davis, Weintraub, and Lassar. It was first described as a nuclear phosphoprotein in 1988 by Tapscott, Davis, Thayer, Cheng, Weintraub, and Lassar in Science. The researchers expressed the complementary DNA (cDNA) of the murine MyoD protein in a different cell lines (fibroblast and adipoblast) and found MyoD converted them to myogenic cells. The following year, the same research team performed several tests to determine both the structure and function of the protein, confirming their initial proposal that the active site of the protein consisted of the helix loop helix (now referred to as basic helix loop helix) for dimerization and a basic site upstream of this bHLH region facilitated DNA binding only once it became a protein dimer. MyoD has since been an active area of research as still relatively little is known concerning many aspects of its function.  Function  The function of MyoD in development is to commit mesoderm cells to a skeletal myoblast lineage, and then to regulate that continued state. MyoD may also regulate muscle repair. MyoD mRNA levels are also reported to be elevated in aging skeletal muscle. One of the main actions of MyoD is to remove cells from the cell cycle (halt proliferation for terminal cell cycle arrest in differentiated myocytes) by enhancing the transcription of p21 and myogenin. MyoD is inhibited by cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). CDKs are in turn inhibited by p21. Thus MyoD enhances its own activity in the cell in a feedforward manner. Sustained MyoD expression is necessary for retaining the expression of muscle-related genes. MyoD is also an important effector for the fast-twitch muscle fiber (types IIA, IIX, and IIB) phenotype. Mechanisms MyoD is a transcription factor and can also direct chromatin remodelling through binding to a DNA motif known as the E-box. MyoD is known to have binding interactions with hundreds of muscular gene promoters and to permit myoblast proliferation. While not completely understood, MyoD is now thought to function as a major myogenesis controller in an on/off switch association mediated by KAP1 (KRAB [Kr√ºppel-like associated box]-associated protein 1) phosphorylation. KAP1 is localized at muscle-related genes in myoblasts along with both MyoD and Mef2 (a myocyte transcription enhancer factor). Here, it serves as a scaffold and recruits the coactivators p300 and LSD1, in addition to several corepressors which include G9a and the Histone deacetylase HDAC1. The consequence of this coactivator/corepressor recruitment is silenced promoting regions on muscle genes. When the kinase MSK1 phosphorylates KAP1, the corepressors previously bound to the scaffold are released allowing MyoD and Mef2 to activate transcription. Once the \\"master controller\\" MyoD has become active, SETDB1 is required to maintain MyoD expression within the cell. Setdb1 appears to be necessary to maintain both MyoD expression and also genes that are specific to muscle tissues because reduction of Setdb1 expression results in a severe delay of myoblast differentiation and determination. In Setdb1 depleted myoblasts that are treated with exogenous MyoD, myoblastic differentiation is successfully restored. In one model of Setdb1 action on MyoD, Setdb1 represses an inhibitor of MyoD. This unidentified inhibitor likely acts competitively against MyoD during typical cellular proliferation. Evidence for this model is that reduction of Setdb1 results in direct inhibition of myoblast differentiation which may be caused by the release of the unknown MyoD inhibitor. Evidence suggests that Setdb1 inhibits a repressor of MyoD and this is the mechanism through which MyoD expression is retained in differentiated myoblasts. MyoD has also been shown to function cooperatively with the tumor suppressor gene, Retinoblastoma (pRb) to cause cell cycle arrest in the terminally differentiated myoblasts. This is done through regulation of the Cyclin, Cyclin D1. Cell cycle arrest (in which myoblasts would indicate the conclusion of myogenesis) is dependent on the continuous and stable repression of the D1 cyclin. Both MyoD and pRb are necessary for the repression of cyclin D1, but rather than acting directly on cyclin D1, they act on Fra-1 which is immediately early of cyclin D1. MyoD and pRb are both necessary for repressing Fra-1 (and thus cyclin D1) as either MyoD or pRb on its own is not sufficient alone to induce cyclin D1 repression and thus cell cycle arrest. In an intronic enhancer of Fra-1 there were two conserved MyoD binding sites discovered. There is cooperative action of MyoD and pRb at the Fra-1 intronic enhancer that suppresses the enhancer, therefore suppressing cyclin D1 and ultimately resulting in cell cycle arrest for terminally differentiated myoblasts. Wnt signalling can affect MyoD Wnt signalling from adjacent tissues has been shown to induce cells in somites that receive these Wnt signals to express Pax3 and Pax7 in addition to myogenic regulatory factors, including Myf5 and MyoD. Specifically, Wnt3a can directly induce MyoD expression via cis-element interactions with a distal enhancer and Wnt response element.. Wnt1 from dorsal neural tube and Wnt6/Wnt7a from surface ectoderm have also been implicated in promoting myogenesis in the somite; the latter signals may act primarily through Myod. In typical adult muscles in a resting condition (absence of physiological stress) the specific Wnt family proteins that are expressed are Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Wnt7a and Wnt4. When a muscle becomes injured (thus requiring regeneration) Wnt5a, Wnt5b, and Wnt7a are increased in expression. As the muscle completes repair Wnt7b and Wnt3a are increased as well. This patterning of Wnt signalling expression in muscle cell repair induces the differentiation of the progenitor cells, which reduces the number of available satellite cells. Wnt plays a crucial role in satellite cell regulation and skeletal muscle aging and also regeneration. Wnts are known to active the expression of Myf5 and MyoD by Wnt1 and Wnt7a. Wnt4, Wnt5, and Wnt6 function to increase the expression of both of the regulatory factors but at a more subtle level. Additionally, MyoD increases Wnt3a when myoblasts undergo differentiation. Whether MyoD is activated by Wnt via cis-regulation direct targeting or through indirect physiological pathways remains to be elucidated.  Coactivators and repressors  IFRD1 is a positive cofactor of MyoD, as it cooperates with MyoD at inducing the transcriptional activity of MEF2C (by displacing HDAC4 from MEF2C); moreover IFRD1 also represses the transcriptional activity of NF-Œ∫B, which is known to inhibit MyoD mRNA accumulation. NFATc1 is a transcription factor that regulates composition of fiber type and the fast-to-slow twitch transition resulting from aerobic exercise requires the expression of NFATc1. MyoD expression is a key transcription factor in fast twitch fibers which is inhibited by NFATc1 in oxidative fiber types. NFATc1 works to inhibit MyoD via a physical interaction with the MyoD N-terminal activation domain resulting in inhibited recruitment of the necessary transcriptional coactivator p300. NFATc1 physically disrupts the interaction between MyoD and p300. This establishes the molecular mechanism by which fiber types transition in vivo through exercise with opposing roles for NFATc1 and MyoD. NFATc1 controls this balance by physical inhibition of MyoD in slow-twitch muscle fiber types. MyoD works with a transient placeholder protein that functions to prevent other transcription factors from binding to the DNA and also retains an inactive conformation for the DNA. Once the placeholder is removed (or possibly deactivated) the necessary transcription factors are free to bind and initiate recruitment of RNA Polymerase II and initiate active RNA transcription. The histone deacetyltransferase p300 functions with MyoD in an interaction that is essential for the myotube generation from fibroblasts that is mediated by MyoD. Recruitment of p300 is the rate-limiting process in the conversion of fibroblasts to myotubes. In addition to p300, MyoD is also known to recruit Set7, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and RNAP II to the enhancer that is bound with and this allows for the activation of muscle gene that is condition-specific and established by MyoD recruitment. Endogenous p300 though, is necessary for MyoD functioning by acting as an essential coactivator. MyoD associatively binds to the enhancer region in conjunction with a placeholding \\"putative pioneer factor\\" which helps to establish and maintain a both of them in a specific and inactive conformation. Upon the removal or inactivation on the placeholder protein bound to the enhancer, the recruitment of the additional group of transcription factors that help to positively regulate enhancer activity is permitted and this results in the MyoD-transcription factor-enhancer complex to assume a transcriptionally active state.  Interactions  MyoD has been shown to interact with: * C-jun, * CREB-binding protein, * CSRP3, * Cyclin- dependent kinase 4, * Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C, * EP300, * HDAC1, * ID1, * ID2, * MDFI, * MOS, * Retinoblastoma protein, * Retinoid X receptor alpha * STAT3, and * TCF3.

In June,\\"Scout Fleet Head Ordered to Hawaii.\\" New York Times. April 18, 1923. he was appointed commander of the Control Fleet, a unit consisting of submarines, destroyers, and Marine Corps units designed to control sea lanes after they had been cleared of enemy forces by the Navy Battle Fleet.Felker, p. 98; Nofi, p. 110. Admiralty Taylor was promoted to rear admiral on October 1, 1922. He was director of fleet training from 1925 to 1927, and afterward commanded the 3rd Battleship Division of the Battle Fleet. was his flagship. During fleet exercises in August 1927, he was informally reprimanded by his superior, Admiral Henry A. Wiley (Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet), for launching planes from aircraft carriers after confronting an enemy rather than using his ships' superior speed to escape.Felker, p. 50. In September 1927, Taylor made Joseph J. Clark (later an admiral himself who played a significant role in the Battle of the Philippine Sea) his division chief of staff.Reynolds, p. 75. Taylor was given command of the Scouting Fleet on March 30, 1926.\\"De Steiguer Is Made Naval Chief Here.\\" New York Times. March 31, 1928. The Scouting Fleet, based in the Atlantic Ocean, was an operational step down for Taylor. Although it contained two divisions of battleships, these were some of the Navy's oldest battleships, and the Scouting Fleet primarily consisted of cruiser and destroyer divisions. The old aircraft carrier was also attached to the Scouting Fleet for aircraft training purposes. Taylor's job was to train the Scouting Fleet for scouting missions.Coletta, p. 637. He was promoted to vice admiral in the summer of 1928. Taylor's command of the Scouting Fleet ended on March 8, 1929. He was succeeded by Rear Admiral William Carey Cole. Taylor was named chief of the War Plans Division of the Office of Naval Operations.\\"Pratt to Succeed to Fleet Command.\\" New York Times. March 9, 1929. Although energetic, deeply interested in Asia and the Pacific region, and a student of blockades and invasions, Taylor contributed little to war planning in these crucial years. According to naval historian Edward S. Miller, Taylor believed that Japan (a rising naval power in the Pacific) \\"deserved\\" American friendship, and that Japanese attempts to control Manchuria were a positive development.Miller, p. 137. Naval historian Robert Love agrees, noting that Taylor deeply distrusted the Chinese and believed the Nationalist Government unwilling to defend its own territory.Love, p. 577. During this period, Taylor became good friends with Japanese Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura.Jordan, p. 91. While serving in the War Plans office, Taylor was appointed to the navy board assigned with selecting officers for promotion to admiral, commander, and captain.\\"Selection Board Named.\\" New York Times. March 22, 1929. He also was appointed to the board of inquiry into comments made by Major General Smedley Butler (USMC) about an alleged crime committed by Benito Mussolini.\\"Butler 'Forgotten', Mussolini Cables.\\" New York Times.

Taylor was promoted to admiral and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet (CICAF) on April 2, 1931.\\"Schofield Assigned to Command Fleet.\\" New York Times. April 3, 1931; \\"Naval Officer Is to Take Admiral Chase's Place in September.\\" Washington Post. April 3, 1931. His command became effective September 1, 1931.Kehn, p. 40.\\"Taylor Takes Command of U.S. Asiatic Fleet.\\" Washington Post. September 2, 1931. He won the position based on a reputation for quick thinking and making decisions without waiting for approval by superiors. His chief of staff was Captain Frank Jack Fletcher (a future admiral who would successfully lead fleets in the Battle of the Coral Sea and Battle of Midway).Lundstrom, p. 4. Admiral Taylor believed that the role of the United States Navy in the Far East was \\"sitting tight\\" and not getting involved. He openly counseled American non-intervention in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria (which began on September 19, 1931)Howarth, pp. 351-352. and believed that Japan could not be convinced to give up her war-won possessions on the mainland without coercion.Stein, p. 32. Nonetheless, he acted decisively to ensure that the United States was positioned to intervene if necessary. The Asiatic Fleet was based in Manila in The Philippines. After the Mukden Incident, Taylor dispatched four fast destroyers to Shanghai without orders. He then ordered (again without approval from superiors) a troop of U.S. Marines to board his remaining ships so that the Asiatic Fleet had a ground force to use as well. As he prepared to sail, only then did U.S. Fleet Admiral William V. Pratt order him to proceed to Shanghai.\\"8 Warships Poised for Shanghai Dash.\\" Washington Post. January 30, 1932; \\"3 Destroyers Quit Manila for China.\\" Washington Post. February 1, 1932; \\"Chief of U.S. Asiatic Fleet Once Again Uses Initiative.\\" Washington Post. February 1, 1932. Taylor's tenure as commander of the Asiatic Fleet was a tumultuous one. On February 24, Taylor helped Italy and China avoid an international incident. An artillery shell from the mainland hit the Italian Navy ship Libia, leading the Italians to threaten retaliation. Taylor convinced the Italians that, in the absence of any intentional shelling, they should consider the matter closed. His advice was taken, and Admiral Pratt publicly praised him for his quick thinking.\\"Sino-Italian Incident Averted.\\" New York Times. February 25, 1932. On March 5, 1932, Taylor joined a joint British, French, and Italian committee sponsored by the League of Nations to investigate the war between China and Japan.\\"League War Inquiry Is Joined By Taylor.\\" New York Times.

He was cordially received by Emperor Hirohito.\\"Japanese Emperor Receives Chief of Our Asiatic Fleet.\\" New York Times. June 5, 1933. Admiral Taylor became nationally known for his tact and diplomacy in dealing with the Japanese. Nonetheless, he stepped down as CINCAF on August 18, 1933. His successor was Admiral Frank B.

Retrieved March 19, 2012. The concept of the show involved Kellerman and his ego (explaining the name of the show) against the world, represented by Holley, broadcasting via satellite from Boston, with producer Bill Wolff, the former \\"Disembodied Voice\\" from Around the Horn, appearing live from NYC as the \\"impartial\\" mediator. On January 18, 2018 on his daily sports radio show in Boston on weei 93.7 the \\"Dale & Holly\\" show Michael Holly said Woody Paige was the first choice to join Kellerman but Paige declined the offer and the role was offered to Holly. Format Each show opened with Kellerman relaying three bits of information he has heard/been told of. He always concluded by saying, \\"but I, Max, say wrong, wrong, wrong\\" and would add a pithy comment afterward. The show was divided into segments, with topics in each segment being scored as \\"rounds\\" (not unlike boxing, which Max has a background in as an analyst for HBO and previously ESPN2). The show was originally scored on a 10-point scale system like a boxing match, with the loser of the round scoring 9 in most cases (8 or less if Wolff determined the argument to be weak enough to warrant it). This later was changed to the winner of the argument getting credit for winning the round. Originally a 15-round format, the show later reduced the rounds to 12. The show was conducted as follows: * Segment 1: Kellerman and Holley argued over the day's sports topics, with Max being presented with the argument from the World's side and countering it with his own opinion while Holley would defend the World's side. Max could stop Holley -or Wolff- from commenting at any time with the use of the \\"MeVR\\", a button that immediately paused their video screens and prevented them from talking. Kellerman would often use the button on Holley in order to interject so he could respond to Holley's argument without talking over him. His use of the button on Wolff was often used as a comic annoyance, with Wolff feigning frustration on camera afterward. * Segment 2: The second segment of the show saw Kellerman and Holley square off against each other in a rotating series of argument-based segments. One was called \\"I Object,\\" where Max and Holley took turns presenting cases for a certain sports subject, with the other side almost always jumping in by saying \\"I object\\" and presenting the opposing view. Wolff served as the \\"honorable judge\\" (dressed as a barrister, even down to a powdered wig) and would either sustain (give the round to the objector) or overrule (give the round to whoever was presenting the case) the objection accordingly. Another segment was \\"The Great Flip-Off,\\" where Wolff (dressed as an old card shark dubbed Willie \\"12 Fingers\\" Wolff) would arbitrarily give Max and Holley two sides of an argument and would score based on who made the better argument for their side. After this segment Holley's involvement with the show ended, although he would appear during the final segment (usually gloating if his side won, which was often immediately met with Kellerman hitting the MeVR). * Segment 3: An interview with a sports figure, ranging from sports columnists to athletes. The entire segment was scored as one round, and if Kellerman performed well enough the round went to him. The World was credited with the round if he didn't. * Segment 4: Max read short emails about topics (sports or otherwise) written by viewers in a rapid-fire segment. Max would then give his opinion on the topic that was the subject of the email. If Max's opinion wasn't considered strong enough, Wolff gave the round to the World side. If there was not enough time to finish all the rounds before the end of the show, Wolff had the power to arbitrarily end the fight after one of the arguments. This would be regarded as either Kellerman or The World being \\"knocked out.\\" If The World won, Wolff read a brief hate e-mail from a viewer. If Kellerman won, Wolff read a positive fan e-mail, referred to as \\"love mail\\". Late in the show's run, the format changed. The first round would still feature the same debate between Holley and Max, but they were no longer scored. The next two segments usually consisted of Kellerman conducting interviews, although there was an occasional second segment game from the previous format that Holley would participate in (otherwise, his time on the show ended after the first segment). The final segment saw Bill Wolff make his first appearance of the show and again saw Max answer emails from viewers, with Wolff arbitrarily deciding after the segment was over whether Kellerman would receive love or hate mail. Cancellation The show was the most popular show on Fox Sports Net, though many people thought the show to be too similar in style to Max's former show, Around the Horn. Despite the high ratings, the last episode of I, Max aired on February 18, 2005, nine months after it debuted. Max Kellerman, on the other hand, has an explanation for the demise of I, Max. According to statements made by Kellerman frequently on his radio show, the show was the highest-rated show on Fox Sports. The cancellation of I, Max, according to Kellerman, was due to his not agreeing to making changes to the show's format that he viewed would damage the show. He also took time away from sports television media just beforehand and after the cancellation due to grief over his brother's October 2004 death from a homicide, which former boxer James Butler was convicted for carrying out.Jacob Adelman.

The technique was developed to reduce costs and improve modularity, and although popular in the 1970s and 1980s, more modern computers use a variety of separate buses adapted to more specific needs. Background scenario Many of the computers were based on the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC report published in 1945. In what became known as the Von Neumann architecture, a central control unit and arithmetic logic unit (ALU, which he called the central arithmetic part) were combined with computer memory and input and output functions to form a stored program computer. Introduction and editing by Michael D. Godfrey, Stanford University, November 1992. The Report presented a general organization and theoretical model of the computer, however, not the implementation of that model. Soon designs integrated the control unit and ALU into what became known as the central processing unit (CPU). Computers in the 1950s and 1960s were generally constructed in an ad-hoc fashion. For example, the CPU, memory, and input/output units were each one or more cabinets connected by cables. Engineers used the common techniques of standardized bundles of wires and extended the concept as backplanes were used to hold printed circuit boards in these early machines. The name \\"bus\\" was already used for \\"bus bars\\" that carried electrical power to the various parts of electric machines, including early mechanical calculators. \\"Continuous Bus Bar for Connector Plate Back Panel Machine Wiring\\" Donald L. Shore et al., Filed August 30, 1967, issued September 30, 1969. The advent of integrated circuits vastly reduced the size of each computer unit, and buses became more standardized. \\"Computer System Adapted to be Constructed of Large Integrated Circuit Arrays\\" Henry S. Miller et al., Filed December 21, 1966, issued August 19, 1969. Standard modules could be interconnected in more uniform ways and were easier to develop and maintain. Description To provide even more modularity with reduced cost, memory and I/O buses (and the required control and power buses) were sometimes combined into a single unified system bus. Modularity and cost became important as computers became small enough to fit in a single cabinet (and customers expected similar price reductions). Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) further reduced cost for mass-produced minicomputers, and memory-mapped I/O into the memory bus, so that the devices appeared to be memory locations. This was implemented in the Unibus of the PDP-11 around 1969, eliminating the need for a separate I/O bus. Even computers such as the PDP-8 without memory- mapped I/O were soon implemented with a system bus, which allowed modules to be plugged into any slot. Some authors called this a new streamlined \\"model\\" of computer architecture. Many early microcomputers (with a CPU generally on a single integrated circuit) were built with a single system bus, starting with the S-100 bus in the Altair 8800 computer system in about 1975. The IBM PC used the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus as its system bus in 1981. The passive backplanes of early models were replaced with the standard of putting the CPU and RAM on a motherboard, with only optional daughterboards or expansion cards in system bus slots. Simple symmetric multiprocessing using a system bus The Multibus became a standard of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers as IEEE standard 796 in 1983. Sun Microsystems developed the SBus in 1989 to support smaller expansion cards. The easiest way to implement symmetric multiprocessing was to plug in more than one CPU into the shared system bus, which was used through the 1980s. However, the shared bus quickly became the bottleneck and more sophisticated connection techniques were explored. Ph.D. dissertation. Even in very simple systems, at various times the data bus is driven by the program memory, by RAM, and by I/O devices. To prevent bus contention on the data bus, at any one instant only one device drives the data bus. In very simple systems, only the data bus is required to be a bidirectional bus. In very simple systems, the memory address register always drives the address bus, the control unit always drives the control bus, and an address decoder selects which particular device is allowed to drive the data bus during this bus cycle. In very simple systems, every instruction cycle starts with a READ memory cycle where program memory drives the instruction onto the data bus while the instruction register latches that instruction from the data bus. Some instructions continue with a WRITE memory cycle where the memory data register drives data onto the data bus into the chosen RAM or I/O device. Other instructions continue with another READ memory cycle where the chosen RAM, program memory, or I/O device drives data onto the data bus while the memory data register latches that data from the data bus. More complex systems have a multi-master bus‚Äînot only do they have many devices that each drive the data bus, but also have many bus masters that each drive the address bus. The address bus as well as the data bus in bus snooping systems is required to be a bidirectional bus, often implemented as a three- state bus. To prevent bus contention on the address bus, a bus arbiter selects which particular bus master is allowed to drive the address bus during this bus cycle. Dual Independent Bus As CPU design evolved into using faster local buses and slower peripheral buses, Intel adopted the dual independent bus (DIB) terminology, using the external front-side bus to the main system memory, and the internal back-side bus between one or more CPUs and the CPU caches. This was introduced in the Pentium Pro and Pentium II products in the mid to late 1990s. The primary bus for communicating data between the CPU and main memory and input and output devices is called the front-side bus, and the back-side bus accesses the level 2 cache. Since 2005/2006, considering an architecture in which 4 processors share a chipset, the DIB is composed by two buses, each of them is shared among two CPUs. The theoretical bandwidth is doubled compared to a shared front-side bus up to 12.8 GB/s in the best case. However, the snoop information useful to guarantee the cache coherence of shared data located in different caches have to be sent in broadcast, reducing the available bandwidth. To mitigate this limitation, a snoop filter was inserted in the chipset, in order to cache the snoop information.An Introduction to the Intel¬Æ QuickPath Interconnect, Figure 4 https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/io/quickpath-technology/quick-path- interconnect-introduction-paper.html Modern personal and server computers use higher-performance interconnection technologies such as HyperTransport and Intel QuickPath Interconnect, while the system bus architecture continued to be used on simpler embedded microprocessors. The systems bus can even be internal to a single integrated circuit, producing a system-on-a-chip. Examples include AMBA, CoreConnect, and Wishbone.

Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled large scale conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies extended throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba. They were characteristically found in the central forest-grasslands transition, the central tall grasslands, the upper Midwest forest-savanna transition, and the northern tall grasslands ecoregions. They flourished in areas with rich loess soils and moderate rainfall around 30-35 inches (700‚Äì900 mm) per year. To the east were the fire-maintained eastern savannas. In the northeast, where fire was infrequent and periodic windthrow represented the main source of disturbance, beech-maple forests dominated. In contrast, shortgrass prairie was typical in the western Great Plains, where rainfall is less frequent, and soils are less fertile. Due to expansive agricultural land use, very little tallgrass prairie remains. History of origin and demise Retreating glaciers deposited the parent material for soil in the form of till, i.e. unsorted sediment, about 10,000 years ago. Wind- dropped loess and organic matter accumulated, resulting in deep levels of topsoil. Animals such as bison, elk, deer, and rabbits added nitrogen to the soil through urine and feces. Prairie dogs, a ground squirrel-like rodent considered to be a keystone species, dug tunnels that \\"aerated the soil and channeled water several feet below the surface\\".Graham, Pam. Tallgrass Prairie. ProQuest Discovery Guides Released November 2011. For 5,000 to 8,000 years, more than of prairie grasslands were a major feature of the landscape. Between 1800 and 1930, the vast majority was destroyed. Settlers transformed what they named \\"the Great American Desert\\" or \\"The Inland Sea\\" into farmland. Major reasons for the prairie's demise were the confined grazing pattern of European cattle versus bison, the near-extermination of prairie dogs, and the plowing and cultivation of the land, which breached tallgrass root systems and interrupted reproduction. Furthermore, extensive tile drainage has changed the soil's water content and hydrodynamics, and ongoing soil erosion results in its increasing loss. Estimates differ of how much original tallgrass prairie survives, ranging from less than 1% mostly in \\"scattered remnants found in pioneer cemeteries, restoration projects, along highways and railroad rights- of-way, and on steep bluffs high above rivers\\" to 4%. Ecosystem Tallgrass prairie is capable of supporting significant biodiversity. Parts of the ecoregion are among the \\"top ten ecoregions for reptiles, birds, butterflies, and tree species. Tallgrass species are found in the understory layer.\\" Oak (blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) and post oak (Q. stellata) ) and hickory tree species occur in some areas, but generally in moderate densities. Bison (Bison bison) were a dominant species. The tallgrass prairie biome depends on prairie fires, a form of wildfire, for its survival and renewal. Tree seedlings and intrusive alien species without fire tolerance are eliminated by periodic fires. Such fires may either be set by humans (for example, Native Americans used fires to drive bison and improve hunting, travel, and visibility) or started naturally by lightning. Boundaries thumb|Tallgrass prairie in relation to the Great Plains As its name suggests, the most obvious features of the tallgrass prairie are tall grasses, such as indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), which average between tall, with occasional stalks as high as . Prairies also include a large percentage of forbs, such as lead plant (Amorpha spp.), prairie rosinweed (Silphium spp.), gayfeathers (Liatris spp.), sunflowers (Helianthus spp.), asters (Aster and Symphyotrichum spp.), coneflowers (Echinacea spp., and Rudbeckia spp.), and many other species. Technically, prairies have less than 5‚Äì11% tree cover. A grass-dominated plant community with 10‚Äì49% tree cover is a savanna. After the steel plow was invented by John Deere, this fertile soil became one of America's most important resources. Over 95% of the original tallgrass prairie is now farmland. Remnants Bison grazing on the Tallgrass Prairie Nature Preserve in Osage County, Oklahoma A pink wild onion (Allium stellatum) ‚Äî blooms in the tallgrass prairie of Waubay Wetland Management District in South Dakota. The tallgrass prairie survives in areas unsuited to plowing: the rocky hill country of the Flint Hills, which runs north to south through east-central Kansas; the eastern fringe of the Red River Valley (Tallgrass Aspen Parkland) in Manitoba and Minnesota; the Coteau des Prairies, which extends from South Dakota through Minnesota and into Iowa; and the far north portion of Oklahoma. In Oklahoma, the tallgrass prairie has been maintained by ranchers, who saw the hat-high grass as prime grazing area for cattle. The Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Osage County, Oklahoma, and the somewhat smaller Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in Kansas, attempt to maintain this ecosystem in its natural form. They have reintroduced plains bison to the vast expanses of grass. Other U.S. preserves include Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie in Illinois, Broken Kettle Preserve and Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in Iowa, Konza Prairie in Kansas, and Prairie State Park in Missouri. In eastern North Dakota is Sheyenne National Grassland, the only national grassland on the tallgrass prairie. Also, several small tallgrass prairie reservations are in Cook County, Illinois, including the National Natural Landmark, Gensburg-Markham Prairie. Tallgrass prairie remnants can also be found among nature preserves within the Hobart Nature District, located in Hobart, Indiana just outside of Chicago. The original extent of tallgrass prairie in Canada was the plain in the Red River Valley, southwest of Winnipeg in Manitoba (see map). While most of Manitoba's tallgrass prairie has been destroyed through cultivation and urban expansion, relatively small areas persist. One of the largest blocks of remaining tallgrass prairie in Manitoba is protected by several conservation partners in a conservation area called the Tallgrass Aspen Parkland. The Manitoba Tall Grass Prairie Preserve, which occupies small portions of the municipalities of Stuartburn and Emerson ‚Äì Franklin, forms a part of the Tallgrass Aspen Parkland. This preserve contains about of tallgrass prairie, aspen parkland, and wetlands. A small pocket of less than of tallgrass prairie remains in the southwest corner of Windsor, Ontario, protected by Ojibway Park, and Spring Garden Area of Natural Scientific Interest, along with the interconnected parks: Black Oak Heritage Park, Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve, and the Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park. Aside from the Provincial Nature Reserve, all are operated by the City of Windsor's Parks and Recreation. Restoration Considered the birthplace of ecological restoration, the first tallgrass prairie restoration was the 1936 Curtis Prairie at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum. The UW Arboretum was the center of tallgrass prairie research through the first half of the 20th century, with the development of the nearby Greene Prairie, Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm and pioneering techniques like prescribed burning. The latter half of the 20th century saw the growth of tallgrass prairie restoration beyond Wisconsin borders, with projects in Illinois such as at Knox College, and Fermi National Laboratory. These major tallgrass restoration projects marked restoration‚Äôs growth from isolated studies to widespread practice. Tallgrass prairie restoration efforts picked up wider public recognition in the 1980s, spurred by the publication of a book of appreciation, John Madson's Where the Sky Began: Land of the Tallgrass Prairie (1982). Nonprofit organizations throughout the former tallgrass prairie region began to reserve or restore small remnants of native prairie. For example, the Native Prairies Association of Texas was founded in 1986 to locate, restore, and protect prairies in Texas; the group currently protects about of Texas prairies. The Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, founded in 1996 near Elwood, Illinois, was as of 2006 the largest tallgrass prairie restoration area in the United States. In Minnesota, Glacial Ridge National Wildlife Refuge was established in 2004. The core of the refuge is a preserved tallgrass prairie remnant, and an additional are either in the process of restoration or will be soon. According to The Nature Conservancy, so far, 100 wetlands have been restored and of land have been seeded with native plant species.

Biography Ciriaco De Mita with Jacques Delors, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, Fran√ßois Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl and Noboru Takeshita at the 14th G7 summit, Toronto 1988 Background and early career De Mita was born in Nusco in the Avellinese hinterland. As a young man De Mita joined Christian Democracy and entered politics. He rose through the ranks of the party, becoming a member of its council in 1956, a member of Parliament in 1963 and a member of the Italian cabinet in 1973. During the next decade he served as Minister of Industry and then as Minister of Foreign Trade. De Mita became chairman of the party in 1982 at a time when its power was declining. He was re-elected in 1986 with 60% support from the party. Prime Minister of Italy After the elections of 1987, De Mita waited a year to become Prime Minister, and then served as Prime Minister for a year, maintaining the party chairmanship. At the beginning of that service, on 16 April 1988, in Forl√¨, Red Brigades killed Senator Roberto Ruffilli, an advisor of De Mita. In social policy, De Mita's time in office witnessed the passage of a law in May 1988 that introduced a new benefit for salaried workers called \\"benefit for the family nucleus\\" (\\"assegno per il nucleo familiare\\"), with the amount varying depending on the number of family members and the family income of the previous year.European Observatory on Family Policies: National Family Policies in EC-Countries in 1990 by Wilfred Dumon in collaboration with Fran√ßoise Bartiaux, Tanja Nuelant, and experts from each of the member states Later political roles De Mita returned in Parliament, after a lag of two years, in 1996 (and then re-elected in 2001 and 2006). He then joined the Italian People's Party and later Democracy is Freedom - The Daisy, party of which he is regional coordinator for Campania. He headed the Olive Tree's list in his region in 2006, and he participated in the transformation that coalition into a single party (the Democratic Party). He joined the Union of the Centre. After the 2008 elections, De Mita was not elected at the Italian Senate, but he was nominated as the Campania coordinator of the party. De Mita won a seat in the European Parliament in the June 2009 European election. On 25 May 2014 De Mita was elected as mayor of Nusco, his native town. Personal life In 1958, De Mita married Anna Maria Scarinzi (born 12 February 1939), with whom he has one son and three daughters, Antonia (born 23 December 1967), Giuseppe (born 10 May 1969), Floriana (born 19 March 1973) and Simona (born 21 April 1974).Tutto al piano di sotto - Irpiniagate - goffredolocatelli.it References Category:1928 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Province of Avellino Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:Christian Democracy (Italy) politicians Category:Italian People's Party (1994) politicians Category:Democracy is Freedom ‚Äì The Daisy politicians Category:Democratic Party (Italy) politicians Category:Union of the Centre (2002) politicians Category:Prime Ministers of Italy Category:Government ministers of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature IV of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature V of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature VI of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature VII of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature VIII of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature IX of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature X of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature XI of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature XIII of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature XIV of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature XV of Italy Category:Union of the Centre (2002) MEPs Category:MEPs for Italy 2009‚Äì2014 Category:Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore alumni ","title":"Ciriaco De Mita"},{"id":"1113569","text":"The Polish Operation of the NKVD (Soviet security service) in 1937‚Äì1938 was an anti-Polish mass ethnic cleansing operation of the NKVD carried out in the Soviet Union against Poles (labeled by the Soviets as \\"agents\\") during the period of the Great Purge. It was ordered by the Politburo of the Communist Party against the so-called \\"Polish spies\\" and customarily interpreted by the NKVD officials as relating to 'absolutely all Poles'. It resulted in the sentencing of 139,835 people, and summary executions of 111,091 Poles living in or near the Soviet Union. The operation was implemented according to NKVD Order No. 00485 signed by Nikolai Yezhov. The majority of the shooting victims were ethnically Polish, but not all (with several others belonging to various minority groups from the Kresy macro-region, ex. Ruthenians) these groups in the Soviet worldview had some element of Polish culture or heritage, and were therefore also \\"Polish\\". The remainder were 'suspected' of being Polish, without further inquiry, or classed as possibly having pro-Polish sympathies. In order to speed up the process, the NKVD personnel reviewed local telephone books and arrested persons with Polish-sounding names. The Polish Operation was the largest ethnic shooting and deportation action during the Great Purge campaign of political murders in the Soviet Union, orchestrated by Nikolai Yezhov. It is also the largest killing of Poles in history outside any armed conflict.  NKVD Order ‚Ññ 00485  The top secret NKVD Order No. 00485, titled \\"On the liquidation of the Polish diversionist and espionage groups and POW units,\\" was approved on August 9, 1937 by the Party's Central Committee Politburo, and was signed by Nikolai Yezhov on August 11, 1937. It was distributed to the local subdivisions of the NKVD simultaneously with Yezhov's thirty-page \\"secret letter,\\" explaining what the \\"Polish operation\\" was all about.

Stalin demanded the NKVD to \\"keep on digging out and cleaning out this Polish filth.\\" First page of one of the copies of the Order No. 00485, archived by the Kharkov branch of the NKVD. The \\"Order\\" adopted the simplified so-called \\"album procedure\\" (as it was called in NKVD circles). The long lists of Poles condemned by a lower NKVD organ (so-called dvoika, a two-man team) during early meetings, were then collected into \\"albums\\" and sent to the midrange NKVD offices for a stamp of approval by a troika (a three-man team; a communist official, NKVD leader, and party procurator). Poles were the first ever major Soviet population group to be sentenced in this manner. After the approval of the entire \\"album\\", the executions were carried out immediately. This procedure was also used later on in other mass operations of the NKVD. The \\"Polish Operation\\" was a second in a series of national operations of the NKVD, carried out by the Soviet Union against ethnic groups including Latvian, Finnish, German and Romanian, based on a theory about an internal enemy (i.e. the fifth column) labelled as the \\"hostile capitalist surrounding\\" residing along its western borders. In the opinion of historian Timothy Snyder, this fabricated justification was intended only to cover-up the state-sanctioned campaign of mass-murder aiming to eradicate Poles as a national (and linguistic) minority group. Another possible cause, according to Snyder, might have sprung from the necessity to explain the Holodomor, the Soviet-made famine in Ukraine, which required a political scapegoat. A top Soviet official Vsevolod Balitsky chose the Polish Military Organization which was disbanded in 1921. The NKVD declared that it continued to exist. Some Soviet Poles were tortured in order to confess to its existence, and denounce other individuals as spies. Meanwhile, the Communist International helped by revisiting its files in search of Polish members, producing another bountiful source of made- up evidence.Timothy Snyder (2005), Sketches from a Secret War Yale University Press, p. 129. Targets of the operation Outline of the Second Polish Republic on the map of the Partitions of Poland. Most territories annexed by the Russian Empire by 1793 (in shades of green) remained in the Soviet Union after the Bolshevik Revolution. The operation took place approximately from August 25, 1937 to November 15, 1938. The largest group of people with a Polish background, around 40 percent of all victims, came from Soviet Ukraine, especially from the districts near the border with Poland. Among them were tens of thousands of peasants, railway workers, industrial labourers, engineers and others. An additional 17 percent of victims came from the Soviet Byelorussia. The rest came from around Western Siberia and Kazakhstan, where exiled Poles had lived since the Partitions of Poland, as well as from the southern Urals, northern Caucasus and the rest of Siberia, including the Far East. The following categories of people were arrested by the NKVD during its Polish Operation, as described in Soviet documents: # \\"Active\\" members of the Polish minority in Soviet Union (practically all Poles). # All immigrants from the Second Polish Republic. # Political refugees from Poland (mostly members of the Communist Party of Poland). # Former and present members of the Polish Socialist Party and other non-communist Polish political parties. # All prisoners of war from the Polish-Soviet war remaining in the Soviet Union. # Members of the Polish Military Organisation listed in the special list (most of them were not members of that organisation). Ethnic breakdown Although the Soviet authorities claim that the executed victims were all ethnic Poles, some of those killed were also ethnic Belarusians, Jews, Ukrainians and Russians mistaken and alleged for being ethnic Poles due to their surnames or religious denominations. 47.3% of the total number of \\"Poles\\" who were arrested in Belarus were actually ethnic Belarusian Catholics, of whom many declared themselves to be Poles in the 1920s. They made up 14.2% of those arrested in the Polish Operation across the Soviet Union (September‚ÄìNovember 1938). 13.4% of those arrested were ethnic Ukrainians. 8.8% of the arrested were ethnic Russians.Martin, Terry. \\"The origins of Soviet ethnic cleansing.\\" The Journal of Modern History 70.4 (1998): 813-861. Killing process and death toll According to archives of the NKVD, 111,091 Poles and people accused of ties with Poland, were sentenced to death, and 28,744 were sentenced to labor camps; 139,835 victims in total. This number constitutes 10% of the total number of people officially convicted during the Yezhovshchina period, based on confirming NKVD documents.McLoughlin, References, p. 164. According to historian Bogdan Musia≈Ç: \\"It is estimated that Polish losses in the Ukrainian SSR were about 30%, while in the Belorussian SSR... the Polish minority was almost completely annihilated or deported.\\" Musia≈Ç is also of the opinion that \\"it does not seem unlikely, as Soviet statistics indicate, that the number of Poles dropped from 792,000 in 1926 to 627,000 in 1939.\\" Almost all victims of the NKVD shootings were men, wrote Micha≈Ç Jasi≈Ñski, most with families. Their wives and children were dealt with by the NKVD Order ‚Ññ 00486. The women were generally sentenced to deportation to Kazakhstan for an average of 5 to 10 years. Orphaned children without relatives willing to take them were put in orphanages to be brought up as Soviet, with no knowledge of their origins. All possessions of the accused were confiscated. The parents of the executed men ‚Äì as well as their in-laws ‚Äì were left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well. Statistical extrapolation, wrote Jasi≈Ñski, increases the number of Polish victims in 1937‚Äì1938 to around 200‚Äì250,000 depending on the size of their families. In Leningrad, the NKVD reviewed local telephone books and arrested almost 7,000 citizens with Polish-sounding name with the vast majority of such nominal \\"suspects\\" were executed within 10 days of arrest. In the village of Belostok, Tomsk Oblast, Siberia, the whole population had Polish origins and was executed, with bodies thrown to Ob River. Assessment According to historian Michael Ellman, \\"The 'national operations' of 1937‚Äì38, notably the 'Polish operation', may qualify as genocide as defined by the UN Convention, although there is as yet no legal ruling on the matter\\".Michael Ellman, Stalin and the Soviet Famine of 1932-33 Revisited PDF file Karol Karski argues that the Soviet actions against Poles are genocide according to international law. He says that while the extermination was targeting other nationalities as well and according to the criteria other than ethnicity, but as long as Poles were singled out basing on their ethnicity, that makes the actions to be genocide.The Crime of Genocide Committed against the Poles by the USSR before and during World War II:An International Legal Study by Karol Karski, Cas eWestern Reserve Journal of International Law, Vol. 45, 2013 The historian Terry Martin, refers to the \\"national operations\\", including the \\"Polish Operation\\", as ethnic cleansing and \\"ethnic terror\\". According to Martin, the singling out of diaspora nationalities for arrest and mass execution \\"verged on the genocidal\\".

By her second marriage to Elizabeth I's favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, she incurred the Queen's unrelenting displeasure.Lacey 1971 p. 15Hammer 1999 p. 280 A grandniece of Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn, and close to Elizabeth since childhood, Lettice Knollys was introduced early into court life. At 17 she married Walter Devereux, Viscount Hereford, who in 1572 became Earl of Essex. After her husband went to Ireland in 1573, she possibly became involved with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. There was plenty of scandalous talk, not least when Essex died in Ireland of dysentery in 1576. Two years later Lettice Knollys married Robert Dudley in private. When the Queen was told of the marriage, she banished the Countess forever from court, effectively curtailing her social life. The couple's child, Robert, Lord Denbigh, died at the age of three, to the great grief of his parents and ending all prospects for the continuance of the House of Dudley. Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester was nevertheless a happy one, as was her third marriage to the much younger Sir Christopher Blount, whom she unexpectedly married in 1589 only six months after the Earl's death. She continued to style herself Lady Leicester. The Countess was left rich under Leicester's will; yet the discharge of his overwhelming debts diminished her wealth. In 1604‚Äì1605 she successfully defended her widow's rights in court when her possessions and her good name were threatened by the Earl's illegitimate son, Robert Dudley, who claimed that he was his father's legitimate heir, thus implicitly declaring her marriage bigamous. Lettice Knollys was always close to her large family circle. Helpless at the political eclipse of her eldest son, the second Earl of Essex, she lost both him and her third husband to the executioner in 1601. From the 1590s she lived chiefly in the Staffordshire countryside, where, in reasonably good health until the end, she died at age 91 on Christmas Day 1634. Family and upbringing Lettice Knollys was born on 8 November 1543 at Rotherfield Greys, Oxfordshire. Her father, Sir Francis Knollys, was a Member of Parliament and acted as Master of the Horse to Prince Edward.Varlow 2007 pp. 23‚Äì24 Her mother, Catherine Carey, was a daughter of Mary Boleyn, sister to Anne Boleyn. Thus Catherine was Elizabeth I's first cousin, and Lettice Knollys her first cousin once removed.Varlow 2007 p. 22 Lettice was the third of her parents' 16 children.Varlow 2007 p. 24 Sir Francis and his wife were Protestants. In 1556 they went to Frankfurt in Germany to escape religious persecution under Queen Mary I, taking five of their children with them. It is unknown whether Lettice was among them, and she may have passed the next few years in the household of Princess Elizabeth, with whom the family had a close relationship since the mid-1540s.Adams 2008a Her parents and the remainder of the family returned to England in January 1559, two months after Elizabeth I's succession. Francis Knollys was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household; Lady Knollys became a senior Lady of the Bedchamber, and her daughter Lettice a Maid of the Privy Chamber. First marriage and love affair Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, Lettice Knollys' first husband in 1572, aged 32 In late 1560 Lettice Knollys married Walter Devereux, Viscount Hereford. The couple lived at the family seat of Chartley in Staffordshire. Here the two eldest of their five children, the daughters Penelope and Dorothy, were born in 1563 and 1564, respectively.Hammer 1999 p. 22 Lettice Devereux returned to court on at least one occasion, in the summer of 1565, when the Spanish ambassador Diego Guzm√°n de Silva described her as \\"one of the best-looking ladies of the court\\" and as a favourite with the Queen.Jenkins 2002 p. 124 Pregnant with her first son, she flirted with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, the Queen's favourite. The Queen found out at once and succumbed to a fit of jealousy.Jenkins 2002 p. 125 The Viscountess went back to Staffordshire where, in November 1565, she gave birth to Robert, later 2nd Earl of Essex. Two more sons followed: Walter, who was born in 1569, and Francis, who died soon after birth at an unknown date.Varlow 2007 p. 28 Walter Devereux was raised to the earldom of Essex in 1572. In 1573 he successfully suggested to the Queen a project to plant Englishmen in Ulster. In the autumn he went to Ireland, not to return for two years. During this time Lettice Devereux possibly engaged in a love-affair with the Earl of Leicester; her whereabouts in the following years are largely unknown, though. In 1573 Leicester sent her a present of venison at Chartley from his seat Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire, and she made hunting visits to Kenilworth in 1574 and 1576. She was also present in July 1575 when Dudley entertained the Queen with a magnificent 19-days festival at the castle.Varlow 2007 p. 44 Elizabeth and the court (including the Earl of Leicester) then progressed to Chartley, where they were welcomed by the Countess of Essex.Jenkins 2002 pp. 211‚Äì212 When Walter Devereux returned to England in December 1575, the Spanish agent in London, Antonio de Guaras, reported: > As the thing is publicly talked of in the streets, there can be no harm in > my writing openly about the great enmity between the Earl of Leicester and > the Earl of Essex, in consequence, it is said, of the fact that while Essex > was in Ireland his wife had two children by Leicester. ... Great discord is > expected in consequence.Jenkins 2002 p. 212 These rumours were elaborated on years later in Leicester's Commonwealth, a Catholic underground libel against the Protestant Earl of Leicester that satirically detailed his alleged enormities.Wilson 1981 pp. 251‚Äì255 Here the Countess of Essex, after having a daughter by Leicester, kills a second child \\"cruelly and unnaturally\\" by abortion to prevent her homecoming husband from discovering her affair.Jenkins 2002 p. 293 There is no evidence that any such children ever existed. The Earl of Essex returned to Ireland in July 1576. At Dublin, he died of dysentery on 22 September during an epidemic, bemoaning the \\"frailness of women\\" in his last words.Freedman 1983 pp. 22‚Äì23; 33‚Äì34 Rumours of poison, administered by Leicester, immediately sprang up and continued, notwithstanding an official investigation which concluded that Essex had died of natural causes.Freedman 1983 pp. 33‚Äì34Jenkins 2002 p. 217 His body was carried over to Carmarthen, where his widow attended the funeral. The Countess' jointure, the lands left to her under her husband's will, was too little to live by and did not comprise Chartley, so that she and her children had to seek accommodation elsewhere.Freedman 1983 pp. 28‚Äì29 She partly lived in her father's house at Rotherfield Greys, but also with friends; Leicester's Commonwealth claimed that Leicester had her move \\"up and down the country from house to house by privy ways\\". She pleaded for an augmentation of her jointure with the authorities and, to reach a compromise with the late Earl's executors, threatened \\"by some froward advice\\" to claim her dower rights. These would have amounted to one third of the Devereux estate.Freedman 1983 p. 29 After seven months of wrangling, she reached a more satisfactory settlement, the Countess declaring to be \\"content to respect my children more than myself\\". She equally‚Äîthough unsuccessfully‚Äîtried to move the Queen to forgive Essex' debts to the Crown, which very much burdened the inheritance of her son, the young Earl of Essex.Freedman 1983 pp. 29‚Äì30 Marriage to Leicester and banishment from court Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, 1575, aged about 43 Lettice Knollys married Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester on 21 September 1578 at around seven o'clock in the morning. Only six other people were present at the Earl's country house of Wanstead Hall in Essex; among these were the bride's father and brother, Francis and Richard Knollys; the bridegroom's brother, Ambrose, Earl of Warwick; and his two friends, the Earl of Pembroke and Lord North.Jenkins 2002 pp. 234‚Äì235 The officiating chaplain Humphrey Tyndall later remarked that the bride wore a \\"loose gown\\" (an informal morning dress), which has triggered modern speculation that she was pregnant and that the ceremony happened under pressure from her father. The marriage was, however, in planning between Leicester and his wedding guests for almost a year. While Lettice Devereux may well have been pregnant, there is no further indication as to this. The marriage date coincided with the end of the customary two-years-mourning for a widow. Leicester‚Äîa widower since 1560‚Äîhad for many years been in hope of marrying Elizabeth herself, \\"for whose sake he had hitherto forborne marriage\\", as he confessed to Lord North. He feared Elizabeth's reaction and insisted that his marriage be kept a secret. It did not remain one for long, the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau, reporting it two months later. When the Queen was told of the marriage the next year, she banished Lettice Dudley permanently from court; she never forgave her cousin, nor could she ever accept the marriage.Hammer 1999 pp. 33‚Äì34, 46Wilson 1981 pp. 230‚Äì231 Even Lady Leicester's movements through London were resented by the Queen,Hammer 1999 p. 46 let alone summer visits to Kenilworth by husband and wife. Dorothy and Penelope Devereux, the daughters of Lettice Knollys, c. 1580 Lettice Dudley continued to style herself Countess of Essex for several years into her new marriage. She lived very discreetly, often with her relatives at the Knollys family home in Oxfordshire. In February 1580 she was expecting the birth of a child there. For the birth of Leicester's heir, Robert, Lord Denbigh, in June 1581, she moved to Leicester House on the Strand. A further advanced pregnancy was reported in September 1582 by the French ambassador, yet the outcome is again unknown. The next year Lettice Dudley became officially resident at Leicester House, and Elizabeth was once again furious with the Earl \\"about his marriage, for he opened the same more plainly than ever before\\". A few weeks later Michel de Castelnau was a guest at Leicester's palatial mansion: \\"He especially invited me to dine with him and his wife, who has much influence over him and whom he introduces only to those to whom he wishes to show a particular mark of attention.\\"Jenkins 2002 p. 280 Robert Dudley had been close to the Knollys family since the early 1550s; several of Lettice's brothers had been in his service, and his marriage only enhanced his relations with her siblings. To his four stepchildren he was a concerned and generous stepfather.Adams 1995 pp. 49, 182, 181 The Dudleys' domestic life is partly documented in the Earl's accounts. Lettice Dudley financed her personal expenses and servants out of her revenue as Dowager Countess of Essex,Adams 1995 p. 28 and remained largely excluded from society life. The three-year-old Lord Denbigh died suddenly on 19 July 1584 at Wanstead. His death shattered the hopes of a dynasty for the House of Dudley.Hammer 1999 p. 35 Leicester stayed away from his court duties for a few weeks \\"to comfort my sorrowful wife for the loss of my little son, whom God has lately taken from us.\\"Jenkins 2002 p. 287 He also thanked Lord Burghley for‚Äîunsuccessfully‚Äîpleading with the Queen \\"on behalf of my poor wife. For truly my Lord, in all reason she is hardly dealt with.\\"Wilson 1981 p. 247 In 1585 Leicester led an English expedition to assist the rebellious United Provinces against Spain. He incurred Elizabeth's wrath when he accepted the title of Governor-General in January 1586. What had especially kindled her fury was a tale that the Countess of Leicester was planning to follow her husband to the Netherlands \\"with such a train of ladies, and gentlewomen, and such rich coaches, litters, and side-saddles, as Her Majesty had none, and that there should be such a court of ladies, as should far pass Her Majesty's court here.\\"Bruce 1844 p. 112 Thomas Dudley, who informed Leicester about these events, stressed that \\"this information\\" was \\"most false\\". At this same time the Earl was giving his wife authority to handle certain land issues during his absence, implying they had no plans to meet in Holland. William Davison, whom Leicester had sent to explain his doings to the Queen, described a visit to the Countess during the crisis: \\"I found her greatly troubled with tempestuous news she received from court, but somewhat comforted when she understood how I had proceeded with Her Majesty.\\"Bruce 1844 p. 144Jenkins 2002 pp. 312, 314‚Äì315 The Earl returned to England in December 1586, but was sent again to the Netherlands in the following June‚Äîto the grief of his wife, as the young Earl of Essex remarked in a letter. Leicester eventually resigned his post in December 1587. The Countess was with him when he died unexpectedly, possibly of malaria, on 4 September 1588 at Cornbury Park, Oxfordshire; they had been on their way to Kenilworth and Buxton.Adams 2008b The Earl's funeral at Warwick in October 1588 was attended by his widow as well as numerous members of her family circle.Varlow 2007 p. 106 Blount and Essex Lettice Knollys, c.1595, by Nicholas Hilliard Lettice Dudley was left a wealthy widow. Leicester's will appointed her as executrix and her income from both her husbands' jointures amounted to ¬£3,000 annually, to which came plate and movables worth ¬£6,000. However, her jointure was to suffer greatly from paying off Leicester's debts, which at some ¬£50,000 were so overwhelming that she was advised to decline the responsibility of dealing with her husband's financial legacy. In March or April 1589, hardly six months after Leicester's death, Lettice married Sir Christopher Blount, a relatively poor Catholic soldier 12 years her junior, who had been the Earl of Leicester's Gentleman of the Horse and a trusted friend of his.Varlow 2007 p. 109‚Äì110Adams 2002 p. 190 The marriage was a great surprise, and the Earl of Essex complained that it was an \\"unhappy choice\\".Hammer 2008 In the face of tittle- tattle that had reached even France, Lady Leicester‚Äîshe continued to be styled thusFreedman 1983 p. 74‚Äîexplained her choice with being a defenceless widow; like her marriage to Leicester, the union proved to be a \\"genuinely happy\\" one. Some 60 years later, it was claimed in a satirical poem that she had poisoned the Earl of Leicester on his deathbed, thereby forestalling her own murder at his hands, because he had found out about her supposed lover, Sir Christopher Blount.Jenkins 2002 p. 361 Lettice's second son, Walter Devereux, died 1591 in France while on military duty,Varlow 2007 pp. 134, 136 and in subsequent years she was anxious for her elder son's safety. She addressed him \\"Sweet Robin\\", longing for his letters and helpless about his moodiness and depression.Freedman 1983 pp. 119, 122Varlow 2007 p. 200 In 1593, she sold Leicester House to him, after which it became known as Essex House. She moved to Drayton Bassett near Chartley in Staffordshire, which would be her main residence for the rest of her life. Still banished from court, she saw no point in returning to London without being reconciled to Elizabeth. In December 1597, having heard from friends that \\"Her Majesty is very well prepared to hearken to terms of pacification\\", she prepared to do \\"a winter journey\\" if her son thought \\"it be to any purpose\\". \\"Otherwise a country life is fittest for disgraced persons\\", she commented.Freedman 1983 pp. 121-122 She travelled to London, staying at Essex House from January till March 1598, and seeking a reconciliation with Elizabeth. At last a short meeting was granted, in which the Countess kissed the Queen and \\"the Queen kissed her\\", but nothing really changed. Essex was imprisoned in 1599 after returning from his command in Ireland without licence; his mother came to London to intercede for him with the Queen. She tried to send Elizabeth a present in the form of a gown, which Elizabeth neither accepted nor refused.Freedman 1983 p. 135 Her efforts to get sight of her son made matters worse: \\"Mislike is taken that his mother and friends have been in a house that looks into York Garden where he uses to walk, and have saluted each other out of a window.\\" Both his military incompetence and his de facto abandonment of his post were condoned on that occasion, but rather than count his blessings and hold his peace, he became malcontent, chaffed at his failures, and fell into rebellion. During Essex' revolt, trial, and execution in February 1601, Lettice remained at Drayton Basset. The event was a comprehensive personal disaster for her, because she lost not only her son but also her beloved third husband, who was, she wrote, her \\"best friend\\". Sir Christopher Blount was executed on 18 March 1601, three weeks after the execution of his stepson, to whom he had been a friend and confidant for many years. Litigation and old age Effigy of Lettice Knollys, Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick The executions and attainders of Essex and Blount led to a legal dispute over the Countess of Leicester's remaining property. In this context she claimed that Blount, in the process of paying off Leicester's debts, had squandered her jewels and much of her landed wealth. The death of Elizabeth I in 1603 meant some form of rehabilitation for the Countess; the new monarch, James I, not only restored her grandson, the third Earl of Essex, to his father's title and estate, but quickly cancelled the rest of her debts to the Crown, almost ¬£4,000. Even more than his debts, the Earl of Leicester's will triggered litigation. He had intended his illegitimate son from his early 1570s relationship with Douglas Sheffield, the adolescent Robert Dudley, to inherit Kenilworth after the death of his brother, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick. Some of the countess' jointure manors lay in the castle's vicinity, while at the same time they had been assigned to the younger Dudley's inheritance by the overseers of Leicester's will. After Warwick's death in February 1590, lengthy legal proceedings ensued over whether particular parts of Lady Leicester's jointure belonged to the Kenilworth estate or not.Adams 2008c In 1603 Dudley initiated moves to prove that he was the legitimate son of his parents and thus the heir to the earldoms of Warwick and Leicester. If successful, this claim would not only have implied that Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester had been bigamous, but would also have nullified her jointure rights. Consequently, in February 1604, she filed a complaint against Dudley in the Star Chamber, accusing him of defamation. She was backed by Sir Robert Sidney, who considered himself the only legitimate heir of his uncles Leicester and Warwick. During the Star Chamber proceedings 56 former servants and friends of the Earl of Leicester testified that he had always regarded Dudley as his illegitimate son. The other side was unable to cite clear evidence and the King's chief minister, Robert Cecil, thought it unwise to rake up the existing property settlement, so the outcome was in favour of Lady Leicester. All the evidence was impounded to preclude a resumption of the case. Throughout her life, Lettice Knollys cared for her siblings, children, and grandchildren.Slater 2007Freedman 1983 pp. 8‚Äì9, 119‚Äì120Varlow 2007 p. 271 Until their respective deaths in 1607 and 1619, her daughters Penelope and Dorothy were her closest companions. The young third Earl of Essex, also called Robert, shared much of his life with the old Countess at Chartley and Drayton Bassett. Still walking a mile a day at nearly 90, she died in her chair in the morning of 25 December 1634, aged 91.Jenkins 2002 p. 368 Widely mourned as a symbol of a by-gone age, she wished to be buried \\"at Warwick by my dear lord and husband the Earl of Leicester with whom I desire to be entombed\\". Her request was respected and she came to rest in the Beauchamp Chapel of Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, opposite the tomb of her son, young Lord Denbigh.

First discovered in 1980 as a regulatory kinase for its namesake, Glycogen synthase, GSK-3 has since been identified as a kinase for over 100 different proteins in a variety of different pathways. In mammals GSK-3 is encoded by two paralogous genes, GSK-3 alpha (GSK3A) and GSK-3 beta (GSK3B). GSK-3 has recently been the subject of much research because it has been implicated in a number of diseases, including Type II diabetes (diabetes mellitus type 2), Alzheimer's disease, inflammation, cancer, and bipolar disorder. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylate either threonine or serine, and this phosphorylation permits a variety of biological activities as glycogen metabolism, cell signaling, cellular transport, and others. GS inhibition by GSK-3Œ≤ leads to a decrease in glycogen synthesis in the liver and muscles, along with increased blood glucose or hyperglycemia. This is why GSK-3Œ≤ is associated with the pathogenesis and progression of many diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Human GSK-3 has two isoforms, Œ± and Œ≤. It is active in resting cells and is inhibited by several hormones such as insulin, endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. Insulin inactivates it by phosphorylation of the specific serine residues Ser21 and Ser9 in GSK-3 isoforms Œ± and Œ≤, respectively. In a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent way. , GSK-3 is the only type of glycogen synthase kinase named and recognized. The gene symbols for GSK1 and GSK2 have been withdrawn by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), and no new names for these \\"genes\\" nor their locations have been specified.GSK1, GSK2. NCBI Gene. Mechanism The active site of GSK-3. The three residues in blue bind the priming phosphate on the substrate, as demonstrated by the ligand. Residues D181, D200, K85, and E97. GSK-3 functions by phosphorylating a serine or threonine residue on its target substrate. A positively charged pocket adjacent to the active site binds a \\"priming\\" phosphate group attached to a serine or threonine four residues C-terminal of the target phosphorylation site. The active site, at residues 181, 200, 97, and 85, binds the terminal phosphate of ATP and transfers it to the target location on the substrate (see figure 1). Glycogen synthase Glycogen synthase is an enzyme that is responsible in glycogen synthesis. It is activated by glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), and inhibited by glycogen synthase kinases (GSK3). Those two mechanisms play an important role in glycogen metabolism.  Function  Phosphorylation of a protein by GSK-3 usually inhibits the activity of its downstream target. GSK-3 is active in a number of central intracellular signaling pathways, including cellular proliferation, migration, glucose regulation, and apoptosis. GSK-3 was originally discovered in the context of its involvement in regulating glycogen synthase. After being primed by casein kinase 2 (CK2), glycogen synthase gets phosphorylated at a cluster of three C-terminal serine residues, reducing its activity. In addition to its role in regulating glycogen synthase, GSK-3 has been implicated in other aspects of glucose homeostasis, including the phosphorylation of insulin receptor IRS1 and of the gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6 phosphatase. However, these interactions have not been confirmed, as these pathways can be inhibited without the up-regulation of GSK-3. GSK-3 has also been shown to regulate immune and migratory processes. GSK-3 participates in a number of signaling pathways in the innate immune response, including pro- inflammatory cytokine and interleukin production. The inactivation of GSK3B by various protein kinases also affects the adaptive immune response by inducing cytokine production and proliferation in na√Øve and memory CD4+ T cells. In cellular migration, an integral aspect of inflammatory responses, the inhibition of GSK-3 has been reported to play conflicting roles, as local inhibition at growth cones has been shown to promote motility while global inhibition of cellular GSK-3 has been shown to inhibit cell spreading and migration. GSK-3 is also integrally tied to pathways of cell proliferation and apoptosis. GSK-3 has been shown to phosphorylate Beta-catenin, thus targeting it for degradation. GSK-3 is therefore a part of the canonical Beta- catenin/Wnt pathway, which signals the cell to divide and proliferate. GSK-3 also participates in a number of apoptotic signaling pathways by phosphorylating transcription factors that regulate apoptosis. GSK-3 can promote apoptosis by both activating pro-apoptotic factors such as p53 and inactivating survival-promoting factors through phosphorylation. The role of GSK-3 in regulating apoptosis is controversial, however, as some studies have shown that GSK-3Œ≤ knockout mice are overly sensitized to apoptosis and die in the embryonic stage, while others have shown that overexpression of GSK-3 can induce apoptosis. Overall, GSK-3 appears to both promote and inhibit apoptosis, and this regulation varies depending on the specific molecular and cellular context. Regulation Due to its importance across numerous cellular functions, GSK-3 activity is subject to tight regulation. The speed and efficacy of GSK-3 phosphorylation is regulated by a number of factors. Phosphorylation of certain GSK-3 residues can increase or decrease its ability to bind substrate. Phosphorylation at tyrosine-216 in GSK-3Œ≤ or tyrosine-279 in GSK-3Œ± enhances the enzymatic activity of GSK-3, while phosphorylation of serine-9 in GSK-3Œ≤ or serine-21 in GSK-3Œ± significantly decreases active site availability (see Figure 1). Further, GSK-3 is unusual among kinases in that it usually requires a \\"priming kinase\\" to first phosphorylate a substrate. A phosphorylated serine or threonine residue located four amino acids C-terminal to the target site of phosphorylation allows the substrate to bind a pocket of positive charge formed by arginine and lysine residues. Depending on the pathway in which it is being utilized, GSK-3 may be further regulated by cellular localization or the formation of protein complexes. The activity of GSK-3 is far greater in the nucleus and mitochondria than in the cytosol in cortical neurons, while the phosphorylation of Beta-catenin by GSK-3 is mediated by the binding of both proteins to Axin, a scaffold protein, allowing Beta-catenin to access the active site of GSK-3. Disease relevance Due to its involvement in a great number of signaling pathways, GSK-3 has been associated with a host of high-profile diseases. GSK-3 inhibitors are currently being tested for therapeutic effects in Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), some forms of cancer, and bipolar disorder. It has now been shown that lithium, which is used as a treatment for bipolar disorder, acts as a mood stabilizer by selectively inhibiting GSK-3. The mechanism through which GSK-3 inhibition stabilizes mood is not known, though it is suspected that the inhibition of GSK-3's ability to promote inflammation contributes to the therapeutic effect. Inhibition of GSK-3 also destabilises Rev-ErbA alpha transcriptional repressor, which has a significant role in the circadian clock. Elements of the circadian clock may be connected with predisposition to bipolar mood disorder. GSK-3 activity has been associated with both pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, namely the buildup of amyloid-Œ≤ (AŒ≤) deposits and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. GSK-3 is thought to directly promote AŒ≤ production and to be tied to the process of the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which leads to the tangles. Due to these roles of GSK-3 in promoting Alzheimer's disease, GSK-3 inhibitors may have positive therapeutic effects on Alzheimer's patients and are currently in the early stages of testing. In a similar fashion, targeted inhibition of GSK-3 may have therapeutic effects on certain kinds of cancer. Though GSK-3 has been shown to promote apoptosis in some cases, it has also been reported to be a key factor in tumorigenesis in some cancers. Supporting this claim, GSK-3 inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis in glioma and pancreatic cancer cells. GSK-3 inhibitors have also shown promise in the treatment of T2DM. Though GSK-3 activity under diabetic conditions can differ radically across different tissue types, studies have shown that introducing competitive inhibitors of GSK-3 can increase glucose tolerance in diabetic mice. GSK-3 inhibitors may also have therapeutic effects on hemorrhagic transformation after acute ischemic stroke. GSK-3 can negatively regulate the insulin signaling pathway by inhibiting IRS1 via phosphorylation of serine-332, rendering the insulin receptor incapable of activating IRS1 and further initiating the canonical PI3K/Akt pathway. The role that inhibition of GSK-3 might play across its other signaling roles is not yet entirely understood. GSK-3 inhibition also mediates an increase in the transcription of the transcription factor Tbet (Tbx21) and an inhibition of the transcription of the inhibitory co-receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) on T-cells. GSK-3 inhibitors increased in vivo CD8(+) OT-I CTL function and the clearance of viral infections by murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 and lymphocytic choriomeningitis clone 13 as well as anti-PD-1 in immunotherapy.  Inhibitors  Glycogen synthase kinase inhibitors are different chemotypes and have variable mechanisms of action; they may be cations, from natural sources, synthetic ATP and non-ATP competitive inhibitors and substrate-competitive inhibitors. GSK3 is a bi-lobar architecture with N-terminal and C-terminal, the N-terminal is responsible for ATP binding and C-terminal which is called as activation loop mediates the kinase activity, Tyrosine located at the C-terminal it essential for full GSK3 activity. Benefits of GSK-3Œ≤ inhibitors In diabetes, GSK-3Œ≤ inhibitors increase insulin sensitivity, glycogen synthesis, and glucose metabolism in skeletal muscles, and reduce obesity by affecting the adipogenesis process. GSK-3Œ≤ is also over expressed in several types of cancers, like colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancer. GSK-3Œ≤ inhibitors also aid in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and mood disorders, including bipolar disorder.

It inhibits GSK-3 directly by competition with magnesium ions and indirectly by phosphorylation and auto-regulation of serine. Lithium has been found to have insulin-like effects on glucose metabolism, including stimulation of glycogen synthesis in fat cells, skin, and muscles, increasing glucose uptake, and activation of GS activity. In addition to inhibition of GSK-3, it also inhibits other enzymes involved in the regulation of glucose metabolisms, such as myo-inositol-1-monophosphatase and 1,6 bisphosphatase. Also, it has shown therapeutic benefit in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases such as epileptic neurodegeneration. Naproxen and Cromolyn Naproxen is a non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drug while cromolyn is an anti-allergic agent which acts as a mast cell stabilizer. Both drugs have demonstrated the anticancer effect in addition to hypoglycemic effect due to inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3Œ≤ (GSK-3Œ≤). To validate the anti-GSK-3Œ≤ hypothesis of naproxen and cromolyn, docking of the two structures against GSK-3Œ≤ binding pocket and comparing their fitting with known GSK-3Œ≤ inhibitor ARA014418 was performed, in addition to measuring the serum glucose, serum insulin, serum C-peptide, weight variation and hepatic glycogen levels for normal and diabetic fasting animal's models to assess their in vitro hypoglycemic effects. Naproxen and cromolyn were successfully docked into the binding site of GSK-3Œ≤ (both were fitted into its binding pocket). They exhibited electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen-bonding interactions with key amino acids within the binding pocket with binding interaction profiles similar to AR-A014418 (the known inhibitor). The negative charges of the carboxylic acid groups in both drugs interact electrostatically with the positively charged guanidine group of Arg141. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding interactions between carboxylic acid moieties of cromolyn and the ammonium groups of Lys183 and Lys60, in addition to œÄ-stacking of the naphthalene ring system of naproxen with the phenolic ring of Tyr134. Antidiabetic effects of naproxen and cromolyn: In normal animal models, both drugs have showed dose-dependent reduction in blood glucose levels and rise in glycogen levels. In chronic type II diabetic model, glucose levels were also reduced, and glycogen level and insulin levels were elevated in a dose-dependent manner with a reduction in plasma glucose. Anti-obesity effects of naproxen and cromolyn: Both drugs showed significant anti-obesity effects as they reduce body weight, resistin, and glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner. They were also found to elevate adiponectin, insulin, and C-peptide levels in a dose-dependent manner. Famotidine Famotidine is a specific, long-acting H2 antagonist that decreases gastric acid secretion. It is used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, GERD, and pathological hypersecretory conditions, like Zollinger‚ÄìEllison syndrome. (14,15) H2-receptor antagonists affect hormone metabolism, but their effect on glucose metabolism is not well established. (16) A study has revealed a glucose-lowering effect for famotidine. Recently, a molecular docking was performed as a preliminary in-silico screening test to study famotidine binding to GSK-3Œ≤ active site. The study of famotidine binding to the enzyme has showed that famotidine can be docked within the binding pocket of GSK-3Œ≤ making significant interactions with key points within the GSK-3Œ≤ binding pocket. Strong hydrogen bond interactions with the key amino acids PRO-136 and VAL -135 and potential hydrophobic interaction with LEU-188 were similar to those found in the ligand binding to the enzyme (AR-A014418). Furthermore, famotidine showed high GSK-3Œ≤ binding affinity and inhibitory activity due to interactions that stabilize the complex, namely hydrogen bonding of guanidine group in famotidine with the sulfahydryl moiety in CYS-199; and electrostatic interactions between the same guanidine group with the carboxyl group in ASP-200, the hydrogen bond between the terminal NH2 group, the OH of the TYR-143, and the hydrophobic interaction of the sulfur atom in the thioether with ILE-62. In vitro studies showed that famotidine inhibits GSK-3Œ≤ activity and increases liver glycogen reserves in a dose dependent manner. A fourfold increase in the liver glycogen level with the use of the highest dose of famotidine (4.4 mg/kg) was observed. Also, famotidine has been shown to decrease serum glucose levels 30, and 60 minutes after oral glucose load in healthy individuals. Curcumin Curcumin, which Is a constituent of turmeric spice, has flavoring and coloring properties. It has two symmetrical forms: enol (the most abundant forms) and ketone. Curcumin has wide pharmacological activities: anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, hypoglycemic, anti-oxidant, and wound healing effects. In animal models with Alzheimer disease, it has anti-destructive effect of beta amyloid in the brain, and recently it shows anti-malarial activity. Curcumin also has chemo preventative and anti-cancer effects., and it has been shown to attenuate oxidative stress and renal dysfunction in diabetic animals with chronic use. Curcumin's mechanism of action is anti-inflammatory; it inhibits the nuclear transcriptional activator kappa B (NF-KB) that is activated whenever there is inflammatory response. NF-kB has two regulatory factors, IkB and GSK-3, which suggests curcumin directly binds and inhibits GSK-3B. An in vitro study confirmed GSK-3B inhibition by simulating molecular docking using a silico docking technique. The concentration at which 50% of GK-3B would be inhibited by curcumin is 66.3 nM. Among its two forms, experimental and theoretical studies show that the enol form is the favored form due to its intra-molecular hydrogen bonding, and an NMR experiment show that enol form exist in a variety of solvents. Olanzapine Antipsychotic medications are increasingly used for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions Atypical antipsychotics are more commonly used than first generation antipsychotics because they decrease the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, such as tardive dyskinesia, and have better efficacy. Olanzapine and atypical antipsychotics induce weight gain through increasing body fat. It also affects glucose metabolism, and several studies shows that it may worsen diabetes. A recent study shows that olanzapine inhibits GSK3 activity, suggesting olanzapine permits glycogen synthesis. A study of the effect of olanzapine on mouse blood glucose and glycogen levels showed a significant decrease in blood glucose level and elevation of glycogen level in mice, and the IC50% of olanzapine were 91.0 nm, which is considered a potent inhibitor. The study also illustrates that sub-chronic use of olanzapine results in potent inhibition of GSK3. Pyrimidine derivatives Pyrimidine analogues are antimetabolites that interfere with nucleic acid synthesis. Some of them have been shown to fit the ATP-binding pocket of GSK-3Œ≤ to lower blood glucose levels and improve some neuronal diseases.

Restatement (Second) of Contracts ¬ß 25 (1981) An option contract is a type of contract that protects an offeree from an offeror's ability to revoke their offer to engage in a contract. Under the common law, consideration for the option contract is required as it is still a form of contract, cf. Restatement (Second) of Contracts ¬ß 87(1). Typically, an offeree can provide consideration for the option contract by paying money for the contract or by providing value in some other form such as by rendering other performance or forbearance. Courts will generally try to find consideration if there are any grounds for doing so.\\"Examples and Explanations for Contracts, 7e\\", Brian Blum, 2017 p. 109. Wolters Kluwer. See consideration for more information. The UCC has eliminated a need for consideration for firm offers between merchants in some limited circumstances. Introduction An option is the right to convey a piece of property. The person granting the option is called the optionorhttp://dictionary.findlaw.com/definition/optionor.html (or more usually, the grantor) and the person who has the benefit of the option is called the optionee (or more usually, the beneficiary). Because options amount to dispositions of future property, in common law countries they are normally subject to the rule against perpetuities and must be exercised within the time limits prescribed by law. In relation to certain types of asset (principally land), in many countries an option must be registered in order to be binding on a third party. Application of option contract in unilateral contracts The option contract provides an important role in unilateral contracts. In unilateral contracts, the promisor seeks acceptance by performance from the promisee. In this scenario, the classical contract view was that a contract was not formed until the performance that the promisor seeks was completely performed. This was because the consideration for the contract was the performance of the promisee. Once the promisee performed completely, consideration was satisfied and a contract was formed and only the promisor was bound to his promise. A problem arose with unilateral contracts because of the late formation of the contract. With classical unilateral contracts, a promisor can revoke his offer for the contract at any point prior to the promisee's complete performance. So, if a promisee provides 99% of the performance sought, the promisor could then revoke without any remedy for the promisee. The promisor had maximum protection and the promisee had maximum risk in this scenario. The modern view of how option contracts apply now provides some security to the promisee in the above scenario.See ¬ß 45 of Restatement (Second) of Contracts for the black letter law of the option contract's application to this situation. Essentially, once a promisee begins performance, an option contract is implicitly created between the promisor and the promisee. The promisor impliedly promises not to revoke the offer and the promisee impliedly promises to furnish complete performance, but as the name suggests, the promisee still retains the \\"option\\" of not completing performance. The consideration for this option contract is discussed in comment d of the above cited section. Basically, the consideration is provided by the promisee's beginning of performance. Case law differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but an option contract can either be implicitly created instantaneously at the beginning of performance (the Restatement view) or after some \\"substantial performance\\". Cook v. Coldwell Banker/Frank Laiben Realty Co., 967 S.W.2d 654 (Mo. App. 1998). It has been hypothesized that option contracts could help allow free market roads to be constructed without resorting to eminent domain, as the road company could make option contracts with many landowners, and eventually consummate the purchase of parcels comprising the contiguous route needed to build the road. Assignability It is a general principle of contract law that an offer cannot be assigned by the recipient of the offer to another party. However, an option contract can be sold (unless it provides otherwise), allowing the buyer of the option to step into the shoes of the original offeree and accept the offer to which the option pertains.John D. Calamari, Joseph M. Perillo, The Law of Contracts (1998), p. 707.  Contract theory  In economics, option contracts play an important role in the field of contract theory. In particular, Oliver Hart (1995, p. 90) has shown that option contracts can mitigate the hold-up problem (an underinvestment problem that occurs when the exact level of investment cannot be contractually specified). However, there is a debate in contract theory whether option contracts are still useful when the contractual parties cannot rule out future renegotiations. As has been pointed out by Tirole (1999), this debate is at the center of the discussions about the foundations of the incomplete contracts theory. In a laboratory experiment, Hoppe and Schmitz (2011) have confirmed that non-renegotiable option contracts can indeed solve the hold-up problem. Moreover, it turns out that option contracts are still useful even when renegotiation cannot be ruled out. The latter observation can be explained by Hart and Moore‚Äôs (2008) idea that an important role of contracts is to serve as reference points.
