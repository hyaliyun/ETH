French dragoons supported by infantry and commanded by General Exelmans destroyed a Prussian brigade of hussars under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Eston von Sohr (who was severely wounded and taken prisoner during the skirmish). Prussian cavalry detachment under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Sohr ventured too far in advance of the main body of the Prussian army with the intention of reaching the Orl√©ans road from Paris; where his detachment was to interrupt traffic on the road, and increase the confusion already produced in that quarter by the fugitives from the capital. However, when the Prussian detachment was in the vicinity of Rocquencourt it was ambushed by a superior French force. Under attack the Prussians retreated from Versailles and headed east, but were blocked by the French at V√©lizy. They failed to re-enter Versailles and headed for Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Their first squadron came under fire at the entrance of Rocquencourt and attempted to escape through the fields. They were forced into a small, narrow street in Le Chesnay and killed or captured. Just before nightfall the same day, the advanced guard of the Prussian III Corps, having heard of the destruction of Sohr's detachment, succeeded in recapturing Rocquencourt and bivouacked there. Prelude After its defeat at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 the remnants of the French Army of the North fell back on Paris, where it was reinforced by some fresh regular army regiments and the French National Guard. They were pursued and harried by the Anglo- Allied and Prussian armies which by 29 June were less than five miles from Paris. The Duke of Wellington, the commander of the Anglo-Allied army, and Prince Bl√ºcher the commander of the Prussian army, met on the evening of the 29 June and determined that one army would confront the French behind their strongly fortified lines line of Saint-Denis and Montmartre while the other army would move off to the right and cross to the left back of the river Seine down stream of the lines. Although this plan was not without risks the allied Coalition commanders decided that the potential benefits outweighed the risks. During the 29 June, as the Coalition forces approached Paris it had also been tolerably well ascertained that, although fortified works had been thrown up on the right bank of the Seine, the defence of the left bank had been comparatively neglected. A further inducement towards the adoption of this plan arose from a report which was now received from Major Colomb, stating that although he had found the bridge of Chatou, leading to Ch√¢teau de Malmaison, destroyed: he had hastened to that of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, on hearing that it had not been damaged; and succeeded in gaining possession of it at the very moment the French were on the point of blowing it up. The bridge of Maisons, still lower down stream, was also taken and occupied. No time was lost by the Prussian Commander in taking advantage of the captured bridges across the Seine. One of his orders that night was for Lieutenant Colonel Eston von Sohr. He was to move, with his cavalry brigade (the Brandenburg and Pomeranian Hussars), from the vicinity of Louvres, and to regulate his march so that he might cross the Seine at Saint-Germain on the following morning. Thence he was to proceed so as to appear, with his brigade, on 1 July, upon the Orl√©ans road from Paris; where he was to interrupt traffic on the road, and increase the confusion already produced in that quarter by the fugitives from the capital. Altogether, he was to act independently and at his own discretion; and, as far as practicable, to impede the supplies of provisions from the western and southern Provinces. Starting at daybreak of 30 June, the Colonel Sohr's brigade passed through Montmorency and Argenteuil, towards Saint-Germain; where it fell in with Major Colomb's detachment, consisting of the 8th Hussars and two battalions of Infantry. It then moved on about a league further, to Marly, upon the Versailles road; which it reached at nightfall, and where it bivouacked. On the morning of 1 July, Lieutenant Colonel Sohr resumed his march, and took the direction of Versailles, which place, however, he did not reach until noon; much delay having occurred whilst passing through the intersected ground in that quarter, and in awaiting the reports from the detachments sent out in different directions to gain intelligence of the French. French preparations for an ambush This bold and hazardous movement of Lieutenant Colonel Sohr's brigade, which was acting independently for the time, did not escape the observation of the French. General Exelmans, who commanded the French cavalry on the south side of Paris, on receiving information that two regiments of Prussian Hussars were advancing by Marly upon Versailles, resolved to attack them. For this purpose he proceeded himself with the 5th, 15th, and 20th dragoons, and the 6th Hussars, comprising a force of 3,000 men, along the road from Montrouge towards Plessis-Piquet, against the front of the Prussian brigade. At the same time, the Light Cavalry Division of General Pir√©, together with the 33rd Regiment of Infantry, consisting of three battalions, were detached against the flank and rear of the Prussian brigade. The 5th and 6th Lancers marched by the S√®vres road upon Viroflay; the 6th Chasseurs proceeded to occupy the cross roads connecting S√®vres with the northern portion of Versailles; the 1st Chasseurs moved by S√®vres towards Rocquencourt, about three miles from Versailles, on the road to Saint-Germain; in which direction the 33rd Infantry followed. Both the latter regiments were destined to cut off the retreat of the Prussian cavalry, should it be driven back by Exelmans. An exceedingly well planned ambush was now laid in and about Rocquencourt, and every precaution taken by the detaching of small parties on the look out. Battle The French ambush is sprung It was late in the afternoon when Lieutenant Colonel Sohr received intelligence that the French cavalry was approaching, and that his advanced guard was attacked. He immediately advanced with both his Hussar regiments, and drove the French back upon V√©lizy, in the defile of which village a sharp engagement ensued. In this attack the ranks of the Prussian Hussars had become disordered; and, as the latter retired, they were fallen upon by the 5th and 6th French Lancers of Pir√©'s light cavalry brigade, which had been posted as part of the ambush. The Prussians then fell back upon Versailles, pursued by the French; who vainly endeavoured to force an entrance into the town, at the gate of which a gallant resistance was made by the Prussians. The short time that was gained by this resistance sufficed for collecting the main body of the brigade on the open space at the outlet leading to Saint-Germain, towards which point it might have retreated through the Park; but having received information of the advance of Prussian III Corps commanded by Johann von Thielmann, and expecting every moment to receive support, Lieutenant Colonel Sohr retired by the more direct road through Rocquencourt. Prussian hussars try to cut their way out About seven o'clock in the evening, at which time the Hussars had collected their scattered force together, and were on the point of commencing their further retreat upon Saint-Germain; Sohr received intelligence, upon which he could rely, that he had been turned by both cavalry and infantry; and that his line of retreat had been intercepted. His decision was instantly formed. He knew his men, their devotion, and their courage; and resolved upon cutting his way through the French with the sword. On quitting Versailles the Prussian Hussars were fired upon by the National Guard from the barrier. They had not proceeded far when word was brought in, that Prussian and British cavalry were approaching from the side of Saint-Germain; but it turned out to be a false report as what had been observed was the 1st Regiment of French Chasseurs. In the next moment the Prussians Hussars were formed for attack, and charged at a gallop. The Chasseurs came on in the same style; but they were completely overthrown, and their commanding officer lay stretched upon the ground by a pistol shot. As the Chasseurs were pursued by the Hussars, two companies of the 3rd Battalion of the 33rd French Infantry Regiment, posted behind some hedges, near Le Chesnay opened fire on the Prussians. The Hussars reacting to the musket fire, struck into a field road to the right, to turn this village, which was occupied by the French. This, however, led them to a bridge, with adjacent houses, occupied by two more companies of the above 3rd Battalion from which they also received a sharp fire. Meeting with this new obstacle, and aware of the proximity of the great mass of cavalry under Excblmans, in their rear; the diminished and disordered remnant of the two Prussian regiments, about 150 Hussars, rallying upon their commander, dashed across a meadow, with the intent of forcing a passage through the Village of Le Chesnay. Fight in the Courtyard at Le Chesnay In Le Chesnay the Chasseurs again opposed them, but were once more overthrown; and the Prussians now followed a road which conducted them through the village, but which led into a large courtyard from which there was no other way out. Not only was their further progress thus checked, but their whole body was suddenly assailed by a fire from French infantry, already posted in this quarter; whilst the pursuing cavalry prevented every chance of escape. Their situation had become truly desperate; but their bravery, instead of succumbing, appeared incited to the highest pitch by the heroic example of Lieutenant Colonel Sohr, their commander, who rejected an offer of quarter. Rather than face annihilation, after Lieutenant Colonel Sohr, was severely wounded by a pistol shot, a few surviving Prussians surrendered. The losses incurred by this brigade during the short campaign had already reduced it, prior to this battle, to between 600 and 700 men, and on the present occasion it suffered a still further loss of ten officers, and from 400 to 500 men. Aftermath The advanced guard of Thielemann's Prussian III Corps, consisting of the 9th Infantry Brigade, under General Borcke, was on the march from Saint-Germain (which it had left about seven o'clock in the evening) to take post at Marly; when it received intelligence of the two cavalry regiments, under Lieutenant Colonel Sohr, had been completely defeated. Borcke hastened forward, and it was not long before his advance became engaged with the French Tirailleurs advancing from Versailles. The French was immediately attacked, and were driven back upon Rocquencourt. As darkness was setting in, Borcke drew up his force with caution. He pushed forward the Fusilier Battalion of the 8th Regiment, supported by the 1st Battalion of the 30th Regiment; and held the remainder in Battalion Columns on the right and left of the road. The vigour of the attack made by the Fusiliers was such that the French retired in all haste upon the nearest suburb of Paris; whilst Borcke bivouacked at Rocquencourt. Analysis Historian William Siborne states that victory favoured the strongest and the best prepared, but it was a French victory gained over a gallant band of warriors; who fought to the last, and did all that the most inflexible bravery could accomplish. In the opinion of Siborne, the detaching of these two regiments so much in advance of the Prussian general movement to the right; and the orders given to Lieutenant Colonel Sohr, to cross the Seine on the morning of 30 June, appear a questionable measure. It is true that this officer was desired to consider himself as acting independently, and without reference to the troops that were to follow in the same direction; but then it must be recollected that he had to proceed along a very considerable portion of the circumference of a circle, from the centre of which the French could detach superior force along radii far shorter than the distance between the Prussian brigade and the main Prussian army; so that, with a vigilant look out, the French possessed every facility of cutting off his retreat. In the circumstances, the preferable course would have been, to have employed Soke's brigade as an advanced guard only; having immediate support from the main columns in its rear.

Established in 1777, the cemetery is owned and maintained by the City of Newton; the Second Church in Newton, its original owner, was known as the West Parish. Description and history The cemetery occupies a roughly rectangular plot about in size at the northwest corner of River and Cherry Streets, just north of the village center of West Newton. The street sides of the property are bounded by a low fieldstone wall, which is topped by a distinctive wrought iron cross-link fence. The entrance, on River Street, is marked by dressed granite posts, and is secured by a chain-link gate. There is no paved interior circulation lane, but a rectilinear grid of pathways is discernible in the landscape. The cemetery is divided into a combination of family plots and single plots, with headstones generally oriented facing west. When surveyed in 2004, there were 170 grave markers, down from about 200 at the turn of the 20th century. Newton was first settled in 1660, was incorporated as a town in 1688, and as a city in 1873. Its first parish meetinghouse, with accompanying cemetery, were located in what is now Newton Corner. By the mid-18th century the population in western Newton had grown to the point of meriting a separate parish. The Second Church in Newton was established in 1778, and this burying ground was formally established in 1781. Its earliest burials, however, took place in 1777, with at least five members of the Fuller family, who gave the land, interred there. The Fuller family is buried in one of several tomb mounds that dot the landscape. Use of the cemetery declined significantly after the large Newton Cemetery was established in 1855 (in the then-popular rural cemetery style), and its last recorded burial was in 1891. The cemetery was transferred from the parish to the city in the 1880s. The city made a detailed record of the cemetery, including its burials, layout, and landscaping, in 1901. The cemetery is owned today by the City of Newton. Historic Newton manages the preservation of the graves and tombs of Newton's City-owned historic burying grounds.Newton's Historic Burying Grounds The burying grounds are not open to the public.

It is located in the neighborhood of College Point, near Flushing. The airfield was in operation from 1927 to 1984. History Flushing Airport opened in 1927. The airport quickly became one of the main airports in the New York City area. It was originally called Speed's Airport and was one of the busiest airports in New York City before the emergence of the larger LaGuardia Airport (which opened in 1939). In the early 1970s a skywriting company operated there. Without Alton for expansion, the airport became very crowded as time passed. In 1977, a Piper Twin Comanche crashed shortly after taking off, killing those on board. This incident, and the frequent flooding led to the closing of this airport in 1984. The airport has largely reverted to wetland; its only outlet is Mill Creek, a tributary of the Flushing River and Flushing Bay. Several underground pipes, as well as man-made drainage ditches on the New York City Police Academy campus and north of 28th Avenue, carry Mill Creek from the airport to the Flushing River. Since the outbreak of West Nile virus in New York in the late 1990s, the land has received frequent mosquito larvicide spraying. As of 2000, Flushing Airport still had its air corridor reserved under FAA regulations. A company called Airships Unlimited has been lobbying to convert the abandoned airport into a \\"blimp port,\\" citing the fact that Goodyear blimps used this airport in the 1960s. The benefit of this plan would be to preserve the air corridor for Flushing Airport. In 2004, the Bloomberg administration proposed rezoning the area for commercial development as part of the already existing College Point Corporate Park. However, the plan has met significant protests from the local residents who fear such zoning would bring too much traffic to the area. The proposal has since been deferred. As of September 2008, the access road was under reconstruction, to be reopened eventually as a regular public through-street. The north hangar was demolished on September 24. The remaining hangars were also demolished as of October 1. The street was opened to public use around 2016.

He was considered one of the potentially strongest candidates in the field. However, in September 1987, newspaper stories stated he had plagiarized a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock. Other allegations of past law school plagiarism and exaggerating his academic record soon followed. Biden withdrew from the race later that month. Leading up to the announcement Development of a candidacy Biden had nurtured dreams of someday running for president going back to his college days. He had been mentioned among possible contenders in the 1984 presidential election. He had considered the notion in 1983, pp. 215‚Äì216 urged on by pollster Pat Caddell, who thought there was space for a young candidate. p. 45. A fiery speech he gave to several Democratic audiences had simultaneously scolded Democrats for outdated thinking and encouraged them regarding future directions, and had gained him some notice in the party. However, Biden did not enter the race that season. Nonetheless, he won one vote at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. Biden was active on the party speaking circuit from 1985 on, and was considered one of the best orators among the potential presidential candidates for 1988.Germond and Witcover, Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?, p. 43. The declared absence of Senator Ted Kennedy from the field, to whom Biden was sometimes compared, was also encouraging to a possible Biden candidacy. Biden received considerable attention in the summer of 1986 when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing because of the Reagan administration's stance towards South Africa and its system of apartheid. Status among candidates Biden was initially considered one of the potentially strongest candidates as campaigning began in 1987. p. 131. This was because of his moderate image, his speaking ability on the stump (rated second only to that of Jesse Jackson), his appeal to Baby Boomers, his high- profile position as chair of the Senate Judiciary committee, looming for the Robert Bork confirmation hearings, and his fundraising appeal--his $1.7 million raised in the first quarter of 1987 was more than any other candidate.Taylor, See How They Run, p. 83. By the end of April he had raised $2 million, using not just contributions from Delaware but also establishing a base of support among young professionals and Jewish voters in a number of urban- and suburban-oriented states. He had no campaign debt, and Fortune magazine termed his \\"most impressive start\\" a \\"surprise\\". When the campaign began, former Senator Gary Hart, who had made a strong nomination run four years earlier, was considered the clear front-runner. Indeed, The Wall Street Journal referred to the eight-person Democratic field as \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\". p. 243. However, Hart then withdrew from the race in May 1987, following revelations of his friendship with Donna Rice. Despite this, Biden did not see a rise in his poll numbers immediately after the Hart withdrawal, and was particularly stagnant in polls for the Iowa caucuses. Nevertheless, Biden had confidence that he could prevail; on the eve of his announcement, he said: \\"I'm going to win this thing. I really am. I just know it, I can feel it in my fingertips.\\" Some political professionals saw Biden as believing that he could simply will himself to win the race, but his continued ability to raise campaign funds gave him credibility as a candidate. However, later reports suggest that up until his announcement, Biden was actually unsure whether he wanted to run at all, and it took the urging of his wife Jill Biden to convince him to go forward. Announcement Announcement of Biden's official candidacy At the age of 44, Biden became one of the official candidates for Democratic nomination, formally declaring his candidacy at the Wilmington train station on June 9, 1987. In his speech, Biden said that Americans should rise above \\"the mere accumulation of material things\\". In language intended to recall John F. Kennedy, he said, \\"For too long in this society, we have celebrated unrestrained individualism over common community. For too long as a nation, we have been lulled by the anthem of self-interest. For a decade, led by Ronald Reagan, self-aggrandizement has been the full-throated cry of this society: 'I've got mine so why don't you get yours' and 'What's in it for me?' ... We must rekindle the fire of idealism in our society, for nothing suffocates the promise of America more than unbounded cynicism and indifference.\\" Biden also laid out the platform he was running on, which included a middle stance between protectionism and free trade, opposition to the Reagan Strategic Defense Initiative, and support for child welfare, reduction of poverty, and the war against illegal drugs. Biden also emphasized the need for integrity in government. Campaign staff and policy team Biden's campaign manager was Tim Ridley, his press secretary was Larry Rasky, and his pollster and strategist was Pat Caddell. pp. 102‚Äì103. Biden's Senate chief-of-staff Ted Kaufman served as the campaign treasurer and principle fundraiser. John Marttila served as a political consultant and Tom Donilon served as another strategist. Biden's sister Valerie Biden Owens also served a major role in running the campaign, as she had in all of his Senate campaigns, and was considered \\"first among equals\\" in making decisions. Campaign Summer 1987 Once underway, Biden's campaign messaging became confused due to staff rivalries and bickering.Taylor, See How They Run, pp. 108‚Äì109. Four different themes were presented, sometimes simultaneously: \\"Pepsi Generation\\", \\"Voice of optimism\\", \\"Save the children\\", and \\"Scold the voters\\". Pollster Pat Caddell in particular was a disruptive force within the campaign, but he had been Biden's friend for fifteen years. Another of the themes was generational change; Biden hoped to inspire a new generation, as John F. Kennedy had inspired his. p. 364. Indeed, Biden had a theory of presidential elections as a cycle, wherein there are candidates, such as he saw himself, who can bring with them large spurts of sometimes disruptive progress, followed by periods of adjustment in which voters prefer candidates who can \\"let America catch its breath.\\" However, the generational change theme was not catching on especially well.Drew, Election Journal 1987-1988, p. 17. Biden was also hurt by his never having been a player in the Washington social scene. He would later write that his messaging had been \\"a bit opaque, like audiences were hearing me through a veil. ... I started looking at the race through the wrong prism. I looked around, judg[ing] myself against the other potential candidates for the nomination ...\\" He received somewhat mixed notices for his performance in the first of the Democratic presidential primary debates, which was held at the Wortham Theater Center in Houston, Texas on July 1, 1987, during a special production of William F. Buckley's Firing Line program. Biden received audience applause for his energy policy in favor of domestic oil production, for his objections to what he called unfair trade practices of foreign countries, and for his criticisms of the Reagan administrations policies in Central America. Biden was also suffering from having to divide his attention between the campaign, Senate responsibilities (including handling the Bork nomination), and family duties, but he campaigned intensively nonetheless. A profile at the time in the Dallas Morning News assessed him thusly: \\"He brings to the campaign an ingratiating manner and a quick wit with considerable Irish charm plus an ability to rouse audiences that few Democrats can match. But he also brings a reputation as a showboater and a hothead with a penchant for windiness.\\" Such was his propensity to keep talking at campaign appearances that staffers gave reporters a note saying that \\"Senator may stray from prepared remarks\\". Then, as throughout his career, Biden was, as the New York Times later profiled, \\"a 'gut politician,' ... swaggering, ad-libbing, liable to get carried away in front of a crowd.\\" By August 1987, Biden's campaign had begun to lag behind those of Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt, although he had still raised more funds than all candidates but Dukakis, and was seeing an upturn in Iowa polls. p. 46. Kinnock controversy Major controversy beset Biden's candidacy, beginning on September 12, 1987 with high-profile articles in The New York Times and The Des Moines Register.Taylor, See How They Run, pp. 89, 91. Biden was accused of plagiarizing a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour Party. Kinnock's speech, delivered to a Welsh Labour Party conference on May 15, 1987, and then rebroadcast during the UK 1987 general election, made reference to his background and that of his wife Glenys. It included the lines: Biden's speech made reference to himself and his wife Jill, and included the lines: Biden went on to duplicate other parts of Kinnock's speech, such as their forebears' ability to read and write poetry, their strength in working for hours underground in a mine only to come up and play football afterward, and their being limited by lack of a \\"platform\\" upon which to stand. Biden had in fact cited Kinnock as the source for the formulation on previous occasions. However, he made no reference to the original source at the August 23 Democratic debate at the Iowa State Fair being reported on,Germond and Witcover, Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?, pp. 230‚Äì232. nor in an August 26 interview for the National Education Association. Moreover, while political speeches often appropriate ideas and language from each other, Biden's use came under more scrutiny because he fabricated aspects of his own family's background in order to match Kinnock's. Following the Kinnock attention, reports came from the San Jose Mercury News of Biden giving a February 3, 1987, speech to the California Democratic Party that reused without credit passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy, and of Biden giving 1985 and 1986 speeches that did the same with a passage from a 1976 speech by Hubert H. Humphrey.Germond and Witcover, Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?, pp. 233‚Äì234. In the Kennedy case ‚Äì which got the greater attention, since there was film footage of both versions that television news programs could play side-by-side ‚Äì Pat Caddell stated that the reuse without credit was his own fault, and that he had never informed Biden of the source of the material. It was also reported that the California speech had taken a short phrase from the 1961 inaugural address of John F. Kennedy. After Biden withdrew from the race, it came to light that he had indeed correctly credited Kinnock on other occasions. However, in the Iowa speech that was recorded and distributed to reporters (with a parallel video of Kinnock) by aides to Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, he failed to do so. Dukakis, who disowned any knowledge of the Kinnock video, fired John Sasso, his campaign manager and long-time Chief of Staff, but Biden's campaign could not recover. Academic revelations During the Kinnock controversy, there was discussion of an incident during Biden's first year at Syracuse University School of Law in 1965. Biden initially received an \\"F\\" in an introductory class on legal methodology for writing a paper relying almost exclusively on a single Fordham Law Review article, which he had cited only once. Biden was allowed to repeat the course and passed with high marks. Though the then-dean of the law school, as well as Biden's former professor, downplayed the incident, they did find that Biden drew \\"chunks of heavy legal prose directly from\\" the article in question. Biden said it was inadvertent due to his not knowing the proper rules of citation. After ending his Presidential campaign, Biden requested the Board of Professional Responsibility of the Delaware Supreme Court review the issue. The Board concluded on December 21, 1987, after Biden had withdrawn, that the senator had not violated any rules, although Biden did not release this result until May 1989. When questioned by a New Hampshire resident about his grades in law school, Biden replied \\"I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect,\\"Germond and Witcover, Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?, p. 235. and then had inaccurately said that he had graduated in the \\"top half\\" of his class, that he had attended law school on a full scholarship, and had received three degrees in college. In fact, he had earned a single B.A. with a double major in history and political science, and had received a half scholarship to law school based on financial need with some additional assistance based in part upon academics, and had graduated 76th out of 85 in his law school class. During this time, Biden also released his undergraduate grades, which were unexceptional. Youth activism Before and during the campaign, Biden had a tendency to invent a past as a marcher in the Civil Rights Movement. For instance, in a February 1987 speech in New Hampshire, he said, \\"When I marched in the civil rights movement, I did not march with a 12-point program. I marched with tens of thousands of others to change attitudes. And we changed attitudes.\\" Statements of this nature had been made by Biden going back to at least 1983. Such statements concerned campaign advisors, who knew they did not represent a truthful recollection of Biden's past; Biden said he understood, but continued to make them. Following the Kinnock and academic revelations, reporters pressed Biden on the matter. Biden acknowledged that his activities were actually limited to one summer job incident, where while working as a lifeguard at a swimming pool, he learned of racial inequality issues and joined black lifeguards in establishing a picket line around a local movie theater that had a segregation policy. Biden said, \\"The civil-rights movement was an awakening for me, not as a consequence of my participation but as a consequence of my being made aware of what was happening.\\" Speaking to reporters, he objected to this line of questions as a whole, saying, \\"I find y'all going back and saying, 'Well, where were you, Senator Biden, at the time?' ‚Äì you know, I think it's bizarre. ... Other people marched. I ran for office.\\" Withdrawal On September 17, 1987, Biden held a press conference at the United States Capitol in an attempt to address these questions and put the issues behind him. He acknowledged that \\"I've done some dumb things, and I'll do dumb things again.\\" However, he vowed to stay in the race regardless. A number of Biden's senate colleagues supported him regarding the controversies, including longtime Democratic fixture Robert C. Byrd and Republican Alan Simpson, who quoted Theodore Roosevelt's \\"The Man in the Arena\\" speech. However, the Kinnock and academic revelations were magnified by the limited amount of other news about the nomination race at the time, p. 37. when most of the public were not yet paying attention to any of the campaigns; Biden thus fell into what Washington Post writer Paul Taylor described as that year's trend, a \\"trial by media ordeal\\".Taylor, See How They Run, pp. 86, 88. As Valerie Biden Owens later said, \\"It was a tsunami.\\" Biden lacked a strong demographic or political group of support to help him survive the crisis.Taylor, See How They Run, pp. 88‚Äì89. The controversy also hit Biden in his most vulnerable area, accentuating the notion that he lacked mental and verbal discipline.Drew, Election Journal 1987-1988, p. 16. Biden withdrew from the nomination race on September 23, 1987, saying his candidacy had been overrun by \\"the exaggerated shadow\\" of his past mistakes. His formal campaign had lasted only three and a half months. Aftermath Because of his early withdrawal, Biden did not participate in the 1988 caucuses and primaries, in which Governor Michael Dukakis defeated Jesse Jackson, Senators Al Gore and Paul Simon, and other longer-standing contenders. In retrospect, Biden would take the blame for his mistakes during the campaign. On one, he said, \\"All I had to say was 'Like Kinnock.' If I'd just said those two words, 'Like Kinnock,' and I didn't. It was my fault, nobody else's fault.\\" On another, he ruefully recalled, \\"'Hey pal, you want to compare IQs?' What an immature thing to say.\\" Biden had felt poorly physically during parts of the campaign, suffering repeated headaches and at one point in September 1987 having to halt a speech in New Hampshire for 15 minutes after feeling faint. During his time on the road he carried an oversize bottle of Tylenol with him. In February 1988, he suffered the first of two brain aneurysms that required life-saving surgery and seven months away from the Senate in order to convalesce. Biden and others would speculate that had his campaign not ended early, the aneurysms might have been more severe or detected later and that he might not have lived out the year. In any case, Biden would not run again for the presidency until his 2008 campaign, twenty years later. This time he made it to the Iowa caucuses, but withdrew after a poor showing. Meanwhile, Biden and Kinnock had become close friends after the plagiarism incident. Meeting in August 2008, after Biden had been chosen by Democratic nominee Barack Obama as his running mate, Biden introduced Kinnock to his Senate staff by saying: \\"Hey, you people! Do you know this guy? He used to be my greatest speechwriter.\\" Obama and Biden proceeded to win the general election against the Republican ticket of John McCain and Sarah Palin. Biden's 1988 campaign lapses were never a significant issue in the race, and Biden invited Kinnock to the inauguration. In 2015, as Obama's second term neared completion, Biden considered a possible 2016 presidential bid. He decided not to, in large part due to the recent death of his son Beau from brain cancer. The Kinnock controversy and other failings of the 1988 campaign were not considered to be major factors in the 2016 decision, nor were they considered likely to be a factor in his decision process regarding attempting a run in the 2020 presidential election. On April 25, 2019, Biden announced his 2020 campaign for the presidency. This time he was the front runner, and the failures of his 1988 bid again received scrutiny. Following defeats in the first few contests, Biden staged a crucial win in the South Carolina primary; as news accounts described, it was his first-ever win in a presidential nominating contest in his third such campaign. He leveraged that into a winning campaign and became the Democratic nominee for president. He will face President Donald Trump in the general election in November.

The trains are RATPs version of the MI 2N and looks similar to the other variant, the SNCF Class Z 22500 (MI 2N \\"Eole\\") trains, but each features different motorization and interior layout. The 43 five-car trains were manufactured by a consortium of French manufacturer Alstom (at the time known as GEC Alstom) and ANF Industrie (now part of Canadian conglomerate Bombardier). The final assembly of the trains was performed at Alstom's Valenciennes factory and Bombardier's Crespin factory between 1995 and 2005. The double-decker trains grew out of an effort to increase capacity on the RER A line, one of the world's busiest routes. These trains could carry up to 2,600 people per train, compared to 1,887 people on the single-deck trains that had been used on the RER A since it opened. These double-deck trains proved so successful and popular, operators of the RER A went on to purchase 140 MI 09 trainsets, an improved version of the MI 2N that would be built by the same Alstom-Bombardier consortium.  History  Nation station, showing the wide entry doors, level boarding and stairs to upper and lower decks The R√©seau Express R√©gional (RER) is a hybrid suburban commuter and rapid transit system serving Paris and its suburbs. The RER A line is, by far, the busiest in the system and is the busiest single rail line outside of East Asia, serving over 1.2 million passengers per day. The line started experiencing rapid growth in the 1980s, with traffic increasing by 9% per year on average. In an effort to relieve overcrowding on the line, the RATP began installing the SACEM electronic train control system (which enabled extremely short spacing between trains) and started looking at purchasing double-deck trains. Double-deck trains were already in use on suburban SNCF networks and could carry up to 2,600 people per train, compared to 1,887 people on the single-deck MS 61 trains that had been used on the RER A since it opened. At about the same time, the RATP started construction of the Paris M√©tro Line 14 and SNCF started construction of the RER E line, which would both parallel the RER A in central Paris. That left the RATP and the SNCF looking for new equipment for the RER A and E lines, so in 1989 they decided to team up and issue a call for tenders. In 1992, they placed an order for 17 MI 2N trainsets, which would be based on the design of SNCF's Z 2N trains (Class Z 5600 and Z 8800) used on the RER C and RER D lines with modifications to make them better suited to the busy RER A line, most notably three wide doors on each side of the cars (the Z 2N only had two). The RATP trains for the RER A would be called the MI 2N \\"Alt√©o\\", and the SNCF for the RER E would be called the Class Z 22500, also known as the MI 2N \\"Eole\\" (EOLE was the name of the RER E during construction). The two trains look very similar from the outside, but the MI 2N \\"Alt√©o\\" trains for the RER A would feature three motors per trainset for faster acceleration (the SNCF trains would only have two motors) and stairs from the upper deck to the center vestibule (SNCF trains would eliminate the stairs in favor of having 22 additional seats per train). A pre-production train was delivered in 1996 for joint testing by both RATP and SNCF. The first order of 17 trainsets was delivered between 1997 and 1999 and the first train was put into service on 6 June 1997. RATP ordered a second option of 12 trainsets was delivered between 2001 and 2002 and a third option of 14 trainsets was delivered between 2003 and 2005. The double-deck trains proved so successful and popular, operators of the RER A went on to purchase 140 MI 09 trainsets, an improved version of the MI 2N that would be built by the same Alstom-Bombardier consortium.  Renovations  Starting in 2019, the 43 MI 2N Alt√©o trains are scheduled to undergo a renovation project that will modernize the of the cars' interior (replacement of seats and floor coverings, improved lighting, new multi- purpose areas), the installation of a video surveillance system, the improvement of accessibility for passengers with reduced mobility (adding a call button for passengers in wheelchairs and improved loudspeaker system) and the improvement of the on-board passenger information system. The exterior of the train will also receive the new √éle-de-France Mobilit√©s livery (grey, white and light blue) that other forms of public transportation in Paris are now receiving. The ‚Ç¨134 million renovation contract was awarded to CAF will be paid for by RATP and √éle-de-France Mobilit√©s. The first renovated trains are expected to enter revenue service in 2020.  Description  As dual-voltage units, Alt√©os are able to operate on 1500 V DC or 25 kV AC electrical networks, because this is the case on the RER A line, which uses the two networks (RFF/SNCF from Cergy-le-Haut and Poissy to Nanterre-Pr√©fecture - 25 kV AC, RATP from Nanterre-Pr√©fecture to Marne-la-Vall√©e, Boissy-Saint-L√©ger and Saint-Germain-en-Laye - 1500 V DC). Alt√©os made their commercial debut on 6 June 1997. 43 trains or 215 cars was built for the RER A line.

He is the main beneficiary of fertilizer producer EuroChem Group and coal energy company SUEK. He is a member of the Board of Directors (non-executive director) in both companies. With an estimated personal wealth of $15.8 billion, as of June 2020, he ranked 89th in the Forbes world's billionaires list, and 9th in Russia. According to Bloomberg, as of June 2020, Melnichenko's net worth is estimated at $15.4 billion (84th in the world, 8th in Russia). Too young to gain from the 1990s privatizations that made many oligarchs fortunes, he began trading currency with two friends while a physics student at Moscow State University, taking advantage of the opportunities that opened up in a newly capitalist Russia. After the Soviet Union fell, the trio registered a bank, before Melnichenko began buying assets including in thermal coal and fertilizers. Branching out at the turn of the millennium, he took an interest in the commodities markets with the acquisition of plants and mines, many of which were distressed, transforming them into modern enterprises. He sold his banking interests in 2007, just before the global financial crisis, allowing him to focus on those industrial investments. As Bloomberg reports, Melnichenko \\"consolidated fragmented assets in risky and then-derelict industries and created leading international blue chips in new areas\\" noting that \\"these industries were not considered to be ‚Äòstrategic‚Äô for Russia and were not subject to the political influence that dominated other sectors, like oil and gas, diamond and gold mining.\\" Melnichenko turned EuroChem into Russia's largest manufacturer of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and one of largest fertilizers exporters globally, and SUEK into one of the world's largest coal energy companies that produces higher-quality thermal coal. In the last 15 years, Melnichenko's companies reportedly invested more than $21 billion in the industrial sector. Melnichenko is one of the main social investors and philanthropists in Russia. Apart from his companies' own charitable and social investment programs, the Andrey Melnichenko Foundation runs projects in science and education, supporting gifted children from the regions where his companies operate aiming to create social mobility in Russia. Melnichenko's companies reportedly spent over $500 million on social and charitable projects in Russia. Early life and education Melnichenko was born on 8 March 1972 in Gomel, Byelorussian SSR. His parents were teachers. As a gifted student, he attended the Advanced Education and Science Centre of the Lomonosov Moscow State University, and in 1989, became a student of the Faculty of Physics at Moscow State University. He then transferred to the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, from which he graduated in finance.  Career history   Banking and investments  While at university, Melnichenko began his entrepreneurial ventures opening a currency exchange booth on the campus. Having made their first US$50,000 through a chain of the currency exchange booths, Melnichenko and his partners, two like-minded fellow students, received a banking licence from the Bank of Russia. In 1993, at the age of 21, Melnichenko co-founded the MDM Bank which grew to become one of Russia's largest private banks within ten years. The bank moved onto buying currency at the interbank foreign exchange, developing a derivatives market and debt instruments. From 1993 to 1997, Melnichenko chaired the Board of Directors of MDM Bank. From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, MDM Bank expanded through acquisition, integrating seven regional banks. MDM Bank did not participate in any post-Soviet privatization programs or the loans-for-shares auctions of the 1990s. In 1997, Melnichenko bought out MDM Bank shares from his partners and became the sole shareholder of the Bank and the Chairman of the Management Board. It gradually became one of Russia's largest private banks, based on total assets, and the first in book running of Russian corporate Eurobonds.Euro am Sonntag, 26 April 2008 Bloomberg reported that \\"unlike many bigger rivals, MDM came through the 1998 crisis nearly unscathed, thanks to a conservative credit policy, the lack of illiquid assets and no exposure to government bonds. As competitors went under, the lender snagged some of the biggest Russian companies as clients.\\" From 2001 to 2005, he chaired MDM Bank's Board of Directors. MDM Bank was named the \\"Bank of the Year\\" by The Banker in 2002 and 2003. In 2003, Euromoney and, in 2004, Global Finance, named it the \\"Best Russian Bank\\". In 2000, Melnichenko, together with Sergei Popov, a former metals trader from Ural, co-founded the MDM Group for industrial investments into three areas: pipeline manufacturing, coal production and processing, production and processing of fertilizers. It was done through the acquisition of more than 50 independently run and owned businesses: joint-stock companies, plants and mines, which enabled to form three separate companies: SUEK, EuroChem and TMK (which he exited in 2006 through an IPO at the London Stock Exchange).TMK- Group These industries were derelict and risky and not subject to the political influence that dominated other sectors. With the process of post- Soviet era privatizations having finished five years earlier, no more than 5% of the assets purchased were acquired from the state. From 2001 to 2004, Melnichenko was the President of the MDM Group. From 2004 to 2007, Melnichenko sold shares of MDM Bank to his MDM Group partner Sergei Popov, and focused on the development of the industrial assets in fertilizers and coal. In 2006, Global Finance named it the \\"Best Russian Bank\\" in four categories: corporate management, FOREX, the best organizer of Eurobond loans in the Russian market, and the best consultant in the Russian M&A; market. Following Melnichenko's decision to step down from MDM Bank in 2007, the International Financial Corporation (IFC) purchased 5% of MDM Bank shares for US$185 million, valuing the bank at US$3.7 billion. Having served its consolidating purpose, MDM Group ceased to exist.  EuroChem  Melnichenko became the chairman of the mineral and chemical company OJSC EuroChem in April 2004. In 2007, he became EuroChem's majority shareholder. When EuroChem was founded, the purchased assets included several nitrogen plants and a phosphate mine with Soviet-era equipment. Melnichenko built EuroChem to become one of the world's largest high-tech fertilizer manufacturers. One of EuroChem's key enterprises, Novomoskovsky Azot, became the largest urea plant in Europe, where production of granulated urea began for the first time in Russia. New modern manufacturing facilities were built in Nevinnomyssk (including the first melamine production plant in Russia) and Kovdor (including an apatite and shtaffelite ores processing complex). Modern terminal was launched in Sillamae (Estonia), and Murmansk port was rebuilt. It acquired laboratories in Germany in 2011, which led to creation of similar facilities in Russia and other countries, which are working on the development of second-generation fertilizers, including advanced slow-release products that help reduce the environmental footprint of the agricultural sector. EuroChem bought licenses for potash deposits in Volgograd (2005) and Perm (2008), launching plans to develop two large potash industrial plants. In 2015, EuroChem moved its headquarters to Switzerland for access to the capital markets and international operations. It has manufacturing, logistic and distributing facilities in Russia, Belgium, Lithuania, Estonia, China, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the USA. EuroChem products are sold in more than 100 countries. EuroChem Group has raised funds on the international capital markets. In 2016, EuroChem invested in biological crop nutrition company Agrinos to invest in research and development for a new generation of products. Elsewhere, EuroChem expanded its distribution network, buying operations in the US, Argentina, Brazil and Hungary. It is developing second-generation fertilizers, including advanced slow-release products that help reduce the environmental footprint of the agricultural sector. One EuroChem fertilizer, Entec 26, became the only such product to be recognized by a carbon exchange foundation in Switzerland, marking the first time that the contribution of advanced fertilizers to reducing agricultural emissions was acknowledged. EuroChem is Russia's largest manufacturer of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and one of largest fertilizers exporters globally. It produces higher-value specialty fertilizers including inhibitor products that allow slow release of nutrients into crops, and is launching two Russian potash mines planning to produce 8 million metric tons of the fertilizer a year, a 10th of current world output, as well as eyeing an ammonia and urea plant in Louisiana. According to Melnichenko, EuroChem aims to transform itself \\"into a company that creates and promotes high-tech products\\". Melnichenko is the Chairman of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, Member of the Strategy Committee, and Non-Executive Director of EuroChem Group AG. As of 2020, Melnichenko is the beneficiary of 100 percent of EuroChem. In May 2018, EuroChem sold the Ukrainian subsidiary EuroChem-Ukraine after an embargo imposed by Ukraine on the import of Russian fertilizers. The EuroChem website noted that the sale was made to a company that was closely connected to the former management team.  SUEK  Melnichenko became a director of SUEK JSC (Siberian Coal Energy Company) in February 2005, and the chairman in June 2011. The same year, he created the Siberian Generating Company (SGC) on the basis of electricity assets of SUEK and became the chairman. In 2013, he became the primary shareholder of SUEK and SGC after he has bought his ex-partner's shares. The assets that formed SUEK were distressed ‚Äì production capacity was less than 30 million tons per year, the enterprises employed 70,000 miners yet productivity was low, and virtually none of its output was exported. The average equipment depreciation was 90%. During the early years of the business, SUEK's assets were modernized, debts were repaid, wages and taxes were paid, and a modernization program was launched with new machinery. The old mines and worn-out equipment were transformed into modern enterprises. Several enrichment factories and modules were put into operation with the latest processing technologies that allowed SUEK to produce highly enriched coal with low impurity levels. SUEK built modern coal bulk terminals and upgraded seaports, and built Russia's first coal mine methane processing station to generate power within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol. Russia's first smart mining management control center was built to run all SUEK's operations, monitoring the location and well-being of miners working underground. After the consolidation of electric power assets, Melnichenko created the Siberian Generating Company (SGC) as a part of SUEK, and then spun it out as a separate company. SGC provides between 35% and 78% of electrical power in the Russian regions of its operation. It is the fourth largest heat producer in the world. In 2018, SUEK took over SGC strengthening SUEK as one of the world's largest coal energy companies. Melnichenko led SUEK to become Russia's largest coal producer with operations in seven Russian regions, as well as the world's third largest coal exporter by reserves and sales with distribution in 38 countries worldwide, including the Asia Pacific where coal plays a key role in energy access. SUEK assets produce more than 100 million tons of coal annually, with assured coal reserves of 5.4 billion tons. SUEK is Russia's largest coal producer and a global leader in exporting higher-quality thermal coal. As reported in Financial Times in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency's Clean Coal Centre, \\"SUEK, Russia's main exporter of higher-quality thermal coal, has invested in modern high-capacity washing plants and has ash control technologies at all its coal ports\\". According to Bloomberg, SUEK is Russia's largest producer of higher quality thermal coal which, according to Melnichenko, focusses on \\"high-quality and less-emitting coal\\". Melnichenko is the main beneficiary of SUEK (which now directly owns SGC). As of 2019, he owns 92.2 percent stake in SUEK. He is the Chairman of the Strategy Committee (Non-Executive Director) in SUEK OJSC since April 2015.  Companies and boards  In 2020, he ranked 95th in the Forbes World's Billionaires list (#9 in Russia). Melnichenko's assets include: * EuroChem Group AG: one of the top world producers of mineral fertilizers and Russia's largest fertilizer producer. Melnichenko is the beneficiary of 100% of the company's shares. * SUEK (Siberian Coal Energy Company) JSC: one of the largest coal energy companies in the world and the leading coal, heat and electricity producer in Russia. Andrey Melnichenko is the beneficiary of 92.2% of the company's shares. (Siberian Generating Company LLC (SGC) is directly owned by SUEK). Melnichenko is a Member of the Board of Directors (Non-executive Director) at both EuroChem Group AG and SUEK JSC. According to media reports, in the last fifteen years, Melnichenko's companies invested more than $21 billion in Russia's new economy and industrial sector. His companies reportedly employ over 100,000 people. In 2018, Andrey Melnichenko was recognized as the largest non-oil and gas private investor in Russia, according to the investment ranking of Expert magazine in 2018 (amounting to 20% of all investment by non- oil and gas companies made in Russia in 2012‚Äì2017). Melnichenko's companies reportedly spent over $500 million on social and charitable projects in Russia. Since 2007, Melnichenko has been Member of the Bureau of the Board of Directors of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP), where he is Chairman of the Mining Commission. Though Melnichenko was mentioned on the list of \\"Russian oligarchs\\" named in the CAATSA unclassified report to the U.S. Congress, the report simply listed all businessmen with an estimated net worth over $1 billion, according to the Forbes list 2017. The report states that inclusion on the list \\"does not constitute the determination by any agency that any of those individuals or entities meet the criteria for designation under any sanctions program\\" and \\"does not, in and of itself, imply, give rise to, or create any other restrictions, prohibitions, or limitations on dealings with such persons by either U.S. or foreign persons.\\" Melnichenko noted that he had seen no issues with banks and compliance, but that the situation was impossible to predict going forward. In 2019, Andrey Melnichenko was awarded with the honour of Commendatore of the Order of the Star of Italy \\"for encouraging dialogue and economic cooperation between Italy and Russia\\".  Philanthropy  The Andrey Melnichenko Foundation supports talented children in science and education aiming at creating social mobility in Russia. According to the Foundation, \\"in this way, Mr Melnichenko is \\"giving back\\" to the country that he believes made him who he is today\\". The Andrey Melnichenko Foundation launched a network of educational and scientific centres for gifted children across Russia and is to award scholarships for studying in higher education institutions to select students. In February 2018, the Foundation organized the \\"Internet Olympiad in Physics and Mathematics\\" for high school students in Russia. The winners were given the opportunity to study at the Sirius Centre for Gifted Education. His companies have spent over $500 million on social and charitable programs, which have been recognized as leaders in Russia's annual \\"Leaders in Corporate Philanthropy\\" survey. According to media reports, he is one of the main social investors and philanthropists of Russia. In 2016, Melnichenko was given a special award for \\"good deeds\\" and charity works. JSC SUEK received the Grand Prix for \\"Contribution to the Social Development of Territories\\" at the 2018 \\"Leaders of Russian Business\\" awards, for annually carrying out approximately 150 social and charitable projects in its regions of operation.  Personal life  In 2005, Melnichenko married former pop singer and model Aleksandra Melnichenko in the South of France.Derek Blasberg, Smooth sailing: Aleksandra Melnichenko, Harper's Bazaar, 16 November 2011 They have two children.

The growth of the village continued with the arrival of Congregationalists, and the establishment of the Second Church in Newton in 1764, splitting off from the first Congregational church in Newton Center. An old nickname for West Newton, \\"Squash End\\" , arose from that period. Soon thereafter the West Parish Burying Ground was established, where graves of some of the early settlers of the village are found; this is one of three early cemeteries in Newton. In 1781, the Second (or West) Parish was officially incorporated. Washington Street was from the early days a major east-west road. The railroad was constructed alongside it, opening in West Newton in 1834, which became a stop on the Boston and Albany line. Coaches connected West Newton to Waltham to the north and Newton Lower Falls to the south. The availability of transport spurred development of the area. One of the oldest buildings in the district is the Railroad Hotel, also known as the Davis Tavern, built in 1831 by entrepreneur, educator and civic leader Seth Davis, and now serving as a retail and office space. Here, on April 7, 1834, the directors of the Boston and Worcester Railroad and 50 guests, gathered at the Davis Tavern to celebrate their first train journey coming west from Boston. From that time, the train brought suburban commuters to West Newton. Seth Davis had arrived in Newton in 1802, built his house nearby on Eden Avenue, founded a school, and planted thousands of trees throughout the neighborhood. Photographs remain of the widely- attended celebration of his 100th birthday in 1887, and several nearby streets are named after him. The Railroad Hotel was designated a Newton City Landmark in 2019. West Newton became a nexus of educational reform in the mid-19th century. The presence of the Normal School, or teaching training college, founded by leading educational reformer Horace Mann and led by Reverend Cyrus Peirce, attracted more families to the area. It is thought to be the first college for women in the United States. Nathaniel Topliff Allen (1823-1903) was invited by Horace Mann to head the West Newton English and Classical School where the teachers in training could practice their new methods. The Allen school was far ahead of its time, emphasizing experiential learning, and welcoming all races in co-educational classrooms.The Allen homestead nearby at 35 Webster Street, dates to 1841. The house was later expanded and opened by his daughters as a school where they continued a progressive approach to education. This building, a structure in the Greek Revival style with an impressive columned front, is documented as a stop on the Underground Railroad and is a Newton City Landmark. Elizabeth Palmer Peabody (1804-1894) , who is credited with her strong advocacy for kindergartens and other educational innovations, lived on Temple Street on West Newton Hill in 1850-51. Her sister, Mary Peabody, was the wife of Horace Mann; the Mann family had their home at 155 Chestnut Street (since demolished) and hosted Nathaniel Hawthorne and his wife Sophia Peabody. Reverend Henry Lambert, living at 128 Chestnut Street, was a strong voice for abolition along with his daughter Mary T. Lambert and son-in-law William Francis Allen. The Lamberts had many guests at their house including Ralph Waldo Emerson. These individuals and other West Newton residents met frequently in a reading and discussion society called the Athenaeum. From 1848 to 1931, West Newton served as the civic center for Newton. The town hall was formerly located on the site of what is now Captain John Ryan Park, at the corner of Washington and Cherry Streets. The town offices took over the former building of the Congregational church modifying it to serve the civic needs. This was designated City Hall once Newton was large enough to be officially declared a city in the 1870s. West Newton remains the location of the city's police headquarters and a local district courthouse. Both are housed in Classical Revival buildings built in 1931 on Washington Street, and designed by the architect James Ritchie. West Newton Memorial Library (1926). Photo by John Borchard The original West Newton Branch Library at 25 Chestnut Street is a Tudor Revival structure built in 1926 with funds raised by community subscription. Over the front door carved in the stone lintel are the words \\"Memorial Library\\". The building has now been re-purposed as an annex to the city police headquarters on Washington Street. One church remains in the village center, that of the First Unitarian Universalist Society in Newton. It is a Gothic Revival structure designed by the prominent architectural firm of Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson and built in 1905. Prior to the completion of this building, the Unitarians met in several other buildings in West Newton, including the Railroad Hotel. The congregational church, the Second Church of Newton, was originally located on Washington Street, next to the city hall. Then in 1916 construction was completed of a significant Gothic Revival sanctuary with stained glass windows and a tall ornamented spire at 60 Highland Street, just south of the village center.Two other houses of worship, located to the west of the village center, have had important roles in the history of West Newton. The Myrtle Baptist Church at 21 Curve Street has been a center for a thriving African-American community since the 1870s .

Dating to 1875, this substantial brick building features balanced massing and detailed ornamentation with elaborate brick work and incised floral patters cut into the stone over the windows. It has had many uses since then and now houses a pharmacy on the street level. Two bank buildings also contribute to the collection of distinctive architectural elements in the village. The one-story store fronts on both side of Washington Street have a decorative cast stone decoration in the design of a rope on either side of each shop. The buildings on the south side also feature a marbleized transom. Other National Register historic districts immediately to the south of the village center include the Putnam Street Historic District and the West Newton Hill Historic District . Both were developed as West Newton grew as a commercial, transport and intellectual center in the late 19th century and feature an unusual level of integrity of the original residential architecture from that period.

It was filmed at Pearl Harbor and Kauai. The story is a dramatized, fictionalized account of a real ship known as the USS Echo. It was a sailing vessel that originated in New Zealand and became part of the US Navy during World War II. Plot In 1943, U.S. Navy Lt. Rip Crandall, an expert yachtsman in civilian life, is based at Townsville, in Australia. He is surprised to be assigned command of a sailing ship, the USS Echo, a unique ship in the Pacific Fleet. The only crew member who knows how to work a ship with sails is eager young Ensign Tommy Hanson, who cost Crandall a yacht race with a mistake before the war. Crandall tries to refuse this dubious command, but Hanson and Crandall's former sailing buddy Lt. Commander Vandewater wear down his resistance. Vandewater points out Crandall's poor fitness report and advises that, if he doesn't take this command, he'll never get another. Hanson takes Crandall out drinking with some of the men so he'll feel guilty about abandoning them. The Echo barely makes it out of the harbor, sailing straight into a storm. It arrives at Port Moresby, New Guinea, after accidentally sailing into a minefield. Crandall is supposed to train a replacement to deliver a coastwatcher named Patterson to a location only a shallow-draft vessel can reach. However, the replacement strikes Crandall as stiff-necked and unqualified to handle this kind of mission, so he takes the ship out under his own command to deliver Patterson. Making the crossing with both ship and crew disguised as a native trading vessel, Crandall and his crew are spotted and photographed by a Japanese spotter plane. While they are ashore having delivered their passenger, a Japanese force from a passing war fleet boards the boat, later capturing the landing party when they return. Crandall manages to rally his men to take the ship back. He is then faced with the decision of whether to radio a warning about the fleet, even though that will give away their position to guns on shore. He sends the warning and abandons ship as the guns open fire on the Echo and destroy her. The crew survives to be rescued, and Crandall is given command of a modern destroyer whilst Hanson gains command of a sub chaser for their role in helping to win the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. Cast  Production notes  The USS Echo was based on the real-life USS Echo (IX-95), a 40-year-old twin-masted scow (flat-bottomed schooner) that was transferred from the New Zealand government to the US Navy in 1942, and returned to the New Zealand government in 1944. Columbia Pictures acquired the rights to a story in the July 1956 issue of Argosy titled Big Fella Wash Wash, inspired by reminisces from former Echo skipper Meredith \\"Rip\\" Riddle. The story was advertised on the cover of the magazine as \\"The Wackiest Ship in the Army\\", because the naval vessel had been under Army command while in port, and Columbia used that title when purchasing the story in 1957. The movie never explained any connection between the ship and the Army, puzzling some viewers. (The later TV series spelled out the link.) The director and writer of the film was Richard Murphy, who had written the script for the 1951 film You're in the Navy Now. The film was originally developed for Ernie Kovacs in the lead role, with Lemmon as the ensign. But at production time Kovacs was unavailable, and Lemmon was considered too mature for an ensign; Instead, Lemmon was cast in the lead role and popular actor/singer Ricky Nelson in the supporting role. Though acquired before Operation Petticoat, this film was not released until after that film. The U.S. Navy provided extensive cooperation allowing the producers to film at Pearl Harbor.  TV series  The film inspired the 1965 TV series of the same name. Trivia The real USS Echo was returned to the New Zealand government in 1944 and was subsequently used for the conveyance of food and supplies. It was unavailable for either the film or the later TV series. The ship eventually served as a bar, but was poorly maintained over the years. In 2015, it was determined to be too derelict to preserve, and was broken up for scrap.

Early life Olsen originally studied at the University of Alberta and was a music major. She considered a career as a flutist in a symphony orchestra. However, after joining the university parachuting club and making her first jump, her goals changed. She transferred to the faculty of arts and, after graduating, went into nursing as a career. She acknowledged that she found her first jump terrifying, and stated that all jumpers are terrified the first time jumping. Over time, however, Olsen came to view skydiving as a learning experience rather than a thrill seeking activity. Career Olsen won the Gold Medal in Women's Individual Accuracy at the XIX World Parachuting Championships in Sweden in 1988. Although she had fewer jumps than some of her competitors, she edged out two women from China on the final jump. In 1982, Olsen, along with teammates Brenda Blue, Kathy Kangas, Eileen Vaughn, and Bev Watson, won the Silver Medal in Women's Team Accuracy at the XVI World Parachuting Championships in Czechoslovakia‚Äînow Slovakia-- after which they posed in bikinis in a 1982 issue of CanPara (Canadian Parachutist).CanPara Magazine, 1982 At the time, Olsen had about 800 jumps. She later moved to the United States and finished eighth in the Hit'n'Rock competition at the Parachutists Over Phorty Society meet in Jordan in 1997. By 2003, she was living in Carbondale, Colorado and working as an emergency room nurse at Valley View Hospital. By that point she had 2,500 jumps and was training for the 2003 US Nationals, despite still having fewer jumps than many of her competitors. As an emergency room nurse, she well understood the dangers of her sport, but chose to focus solely on performing optimally on every jump rather than on the risks. She did not compete in the Nationals that year. She also served as Chief Judge in Style & Accuracy at the 2004 US National Skydiving Championships.

A drive is an instinctual need that has the power of driving the behaviour of an individual;Leopold Szondi (1972), Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik p.25 quotation: an \\"excitatory state produced by a homeostatic disturbance\\".Seward, J. (1956). drive, incentive, and reinforcement. Psychological Review, 63, 19-203. Drive theory is based on the principle that organisms are born with certain psychological needs and that a negative state of tension is created when these needs are not satisfied. When a need is satisfied, drive is reduced and the organism returns to a state of homeostasis and relaxation. According to the theory, drive tends to increase over time and operates on a feedback control system, much like a thermostat. In 1943 two psychologists, Clark Hull and Kenneth Spence, had the first interest in this idea of motivation. They knew it was a sense of their motivation, drives, and an explanation of all behavior. After years of research, they created the drive theory.http://web.sonoma.edu/users/d/daniels/hullspence.htm In a study conducted by Hull, two groups of rats were put in a maze, group A was given food after three hours and group B was given food after twenty-two hours. Hull had decided that the rats that were deprived of food longer would be more likely to develop a habit of going down the same path to obtain food.  Psychoanalysis  In psychoanalysis, drive theory ( or ') refers to the theory of drives, motivations, or instincts, that have clear objects. When an internal imbalance is detected by homeostatic mechanisms, a drive to restore balance is produced. In 1927, Sigmund Freud said that a drive theory was what was lacking most in psychoanalysis. He was opposed to personality systematics in psychology, rejecting it as a form of paranoia, and instead classified drives with dichotomies like Eros/Thanatos drives, the drives toward life and death, respectively, and sexual/ego drives.M√©lon, Jean (1996), Notes on the History of the Szondi Movement (French original). Text for the Szondi Congress of Cracow, August 1996. Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents was published in Germany in 1930, when the rise of fascism in that country was well under way, and the warnings of a second European war were leading to opposing calls for rearmament and pacifism. Against this background, Freud wrote \\"In face of the destructive forces unleashed, now it may be expected that the other of the two 'heavenly forces,' eternal Eros, will put forth his strength so as to maintain himself alongside of his equally immortal adversary.\\"Freud, S. (1961). Civilization and its discontents. J. Strachey, transl. New York: W. W. Norton. In 1947, Hungarian psychiatrist and psychologist Leopold Szondi aimed instead at a systematic drive theory.Leopold Szondi [1947] (1952), Experimental Diagnostics of Drives, Introduction of the first edition, quotation: Szondi Drive Diagram has been described as a revolutionary addition to psychology, and as paving the way for a theoretical psychiatry and a psychoanalytical anthropology.Livres de France (1989), Issues 106-109 quotation:  Early attachment theory  In early attachment theory, behavioural drive reduction was proposed by Dollard and Miller (1950) as an explanation of the mechanisms behind early attachment in infants. Behavioural drive reduction theory suggests that infants are born with innate drives, such as hunger and thirst, which only the caregiver, usually the mother, can reduce. Through a process of classical conditioning, the infant learns to associate the mother with the satisfaction of reduced drive and is thus able to form a key attachment bond. However, this theory is challenged by the work done by Harry Harlow, particularly the experiments involving the maternal separation of rhesus monkeys, which indicate that comfort possesses greater motivational value than hunger.Harlow H F; Zimmermann R. R. (1959). Affectional responses in the infant monkey Science, vol(130):421-432. PDF .  Social psychology In social psychology, drive theory was used by Robert Zajonc in 1965 as an explanation of the phenomenon of social facilitation. The audience effect notes that, in some cases, the presence of a passive audience will facilitate the better performance of a task, while in other cases the presence of an audience will inhibit the performance of a task. Zajonc's drive theory suggests that the variable determining direction of performance is whether the task is composed of a correct dominant response (that is, the task is perceived as being subjectively easy to the individual) or an incorrect dominant response (perceived as being subjectively difficult). In the presence of a passive audience, an individual is in a heightened state of arousal. Increased arousal, or stress, causes the individual to enact behaviours that form dominant responses, since an individual's dominant response is the most likely response, given the skills which are available. If the dominant response is correct, then social presence enhances performance of the task. However, if the dominant response is incorrect, social presence produces an impaired performance. Increasing performance of well learned tasks and impairing performance on poorly learned tasks.  Corroborative evidence  Such behaviour was first noticed by Triplett (1898) while observing the cyclists who were racing together versus cyclists who were racing alone. It was found that the mere presence of other cyclists produced greater performance. A similar effect was observed by Chen (1937) in ants building colonies. However, it was not until Zajonc investigated this behaviour in the 1960s that any empirical explanation for the audience effect was pursued. Zajonc's drive theory is based on an experiment involving the investigation of the effect of social facilitation in cockroaches. Zajonc devised a study in which individual cockroaches were released into a tube, at the end of which there was a light. In the presence of other cockroaches as spectators, cockroaches were observed to achieve a significantly faster time in reaching the light than those in the control, no-spectator group. However, when cockroaches in the same conditions were given a maze to negotiate, performance was impaired in the spectator condition, demonstrating that incorrect dominant responses in the presence of an audience impair performance.  Evaluation apprehension  Cottrell's evaluation apprehension model later refined this theory to include yet another variable in the mechanisms of social facilitation. He suggested that the correctness of dominant responses only plays a role in social facilitation when there is an expectation of social reward or punishment based on performance. His study differs in design from Zajonc's as he introduced a separate condition in which participants were given tasks to perform in the presence of an audience that was blindfolded, and thus unable to evaluate the participant's performance. It was found that no social facilitation effect occurred, and hence the anticipation of performance evaluation must play a role in social facilitation. Evaluation apprehension, however, is only key in human social facilitation and is not observed in other animals.

This album was a bit of a departure from the band's previous work. It can be best described as \\"progressive thrash metal\\", featuring more complex song structures, odd time signatures, numerous key and tempo changes, technical riffs and drumming, and even clean sections that often evoked jazz fusion. This newer, more distinctive style earned the band their biggest critical success to date, and many fans hail it as their finest work. Despite this, the album did not sell as well as their previous works due to a shifting musical landscape and as a result, poor advertisement for the album. It has been out of print for many years, though many thrash fans consider it to be a lost gem of the genre. During the recording of Beyond Recognition vocalist Steev Esquivel temporarily left the band due to lack of focus due to drug addiction.

It is composed of a cohesive collection of spacious houses built in the second half of the 19th century, representing the development of the West Newton area as a fashionable railroad suburb. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The Boston and Worcester Railroad was built through West Newton in 1834, leading to its first significant period of growth. At this time, Chestnut Street was laid out across the hill south of the railroad line, and several houses were built. The improvement of regular passenger service in 1843 spurred further growth in the village, and in 1849 developers hired Alexander Wadsworth to lay out an subdivision on the hill. Ten houses were built before 1879, and the majority of the development took place between 1880 and 1900. The district includes of these subdivisions, with 58 contributing houses that are predominantly Queen Anne, Shingle, and Colonial Revival in their styling. Only six houses were built in the area after 1936. One of the oldest houses in the district is 12 Valentine Street, a Greek Revival house that was moved to its current location, and is believed to include timbers used from an early farmhouse. This was formerly the house of Lawson Valentine. One of a handful of antebellum houses in the district is at 128 Chestnut Street, the home of Rev Henry and Catherine Porter Lambert, built in 1854 with Queen Anne alterations introduced in 1900. There are two notable Second Empire houses, at 152 Chestnut Street and 292 Otis Street, and another well preserved example at 129 Chestnut Street. There are also several Italianate houses in the area. Chestnut Street is lined by a significant number of Queen Anne houses, notable among them 170 Chestnut, which features the asymmetrical styling and varied gables, dormers, and projections typical of the style. The houses at 332 and 334 Otis Street are nearly mirror images of one another, with off-center projecting pavilions and hip roofs. The corner house at 333 Otis Street features a pair of turrets, a wrap-around porch with columns with scamozzi capitals, a porte-coch√®re and a turreted carriage house which mimics the main house. The bronze sculpture by Anne Whitney, Child with Calla Lily Leaves, is a contributing resource to the district. This was cast from Whitney's 1893 submission to the World's Columbian Exposition and installed in 1903 in memory of Catherine Porter Lambert of 128 Chestnut Street. Distinctive from most of Whitney's pieces in its Art Nouveau design, this sculpture is located in a small community garden on the island at the intersection of Chestnut, Highland and Valentine Streets. The National Register district is bounded on the west by Chestnut Street, running just south of Westfield Road to Highland Street, and on the north by Otis Street from Chestnut to Lenox Street, which defines the eastern boundary. The southern boundary Valentine and Highland Streets, omitting the houses south of those roads except for those within the triangular junction of Valentine Street with Burnham and Hampshire Roads. In 2017, the Newton Historical Commission and the Massachusetts Historical Commission approved a study report proposing a Local Historic District on West Newton Hill, encompassing about 330 houses, including those in the existing National Register areas including this area as well as Putnam Street, and the Day Estate, and several individual buildings such as: the Second Church, the original Peirce School, the Neighborhood Club and the Henry Day House, now the All Newton Music School. The proposed boundaries of this new district would have linked houses on either side of Chestnut Street into one protected area, while still allowing for ongoing modifications and updates. This proposal did not proceed to a vote by the Newton City Council due to a lack of consensus in the neighborhood. The most historic buildings are not protected from demolition.

This experience will enable students to: *Globalize their educational experience *Enhance academic opportunities that may otherwise be limited or unavailable *Establish professional and career opportunities through networking *Improve language skills and cultural understanding *Experience personal growth Internships Hibur‚Äôs internship program offers students the chance to live, study and work in a foreign country. Internship departments in Boston and Haifa strive to find the best match for the students when placing them in corporate and academic environments in Israel and the United States. As a result of faculty and student interest MISTI decided to create MISTI Israel in the Summer of 2008. The Haifa Department, with the collaboration of MISTI Israel, helped find internships for MIT students in Haifa-based high-tech companies and Technion campus laboratories, Technion- MIT Activities Hibur‚Äôs joint educational activities including video lectures, workshops, delegations, and various enrichment and higher learning opportunities, form an integral part of the program. Video Lecture ‚Äì Throughout the academic year, Technion and MIT researchers give online, dynamic lectures in real-time about the latest research in their fields of expertise. The video lectures are available to the greater student body and do not require prior background knowledge. Teaching Assistant Workshops ‚Äì Every year, MIT conducts a workshop focusing on improving the quality of academic classes. These workshops are geared to teaching assistants and professors alike. In the past, Hibur organized online workshops in which Technion teaching assistants and professors exchanged ideas and information with their MIT counterparts Delegations ‚Äì Every year Hibur sends an Academic delegation of approximately eight to fifteen students to the Technion and MIT to exchange ideas, knowledge, and perspectives with students at the visited campus. This delegation provides a great resource for students to swap information regarding their universities, native countries and ongoing research projects. BizTEC & 100K ‚Äì The Technion holds a yearly entrepreneur competition called BizTEC. The ten finalists of BizTEC then have the opportunity to compete in the equivalent entrepreneur competition at MIT, The MIT 100K.Entrepreneureship Competition. In order to compete, participating groups must have at least one representative from the university that holds the competition. Hibur‚Äôs programs offer students from the Technion and MIT the opportunity to connect and form groups that can work well and participate together in competitions at both universities. Joint Academic Projects ‚Äì Hibur‚Äôs online platform unites students from the Technion and MIT who would like to collaborate on final projects within similar disciplines. Students can perform research, write, and exchange information through Hibur‚Äôs website. Hibur also assists with the logistics involved in connecting researchers with students from each university and building joint intercontinental projects. MathWorks ‚Äì Hibur has implemented a preparation course, which has helped hundreds of students, in Matlab for the Technion pre-university refresher program. Matlab, developed by MathWorks Inc., is a technical computing software program used by engineers and scientists.

On the Duke's left are Elizabeth, Mary, the Duchess, Henrietta, Anne and John. John Closterman (also spelled Cloosterman, Klosterman; 1660 ‚Äì 24 May 1711 (buried)) was a Westphalian portrait painter of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. His subjects were mostly European noblemen and their families. Career Born in Osnabr√ºck in the Holy Roman Empire (now in Lower Saxony), Closterman was the son of an artist who taught him the rudiments of design. In 1679, Closterman went to Paris and worked under Fran√ßois de Troy. In 1681, he went to England. He worked for John Riley, painting the draperies in Riley's portraits When Riley died in 1691, Closterman finished several of his portraits. Because of his work on Riley's portraits, Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, hired him to create some paintings. However, Somerset became dissatisfied about a portrait of the Italian painter Guercino that Closterman had painted for him, ending the relationship. Lord Halifax eventually purchased the portrait. In 1696, Closterman was invited to the court of Spain, where he painted a portrait of Charles II of Spain, his wife, Mariana of Austria and some others. He also traveled to Italy twice, where he bought several artworks. When he returned to England, Closterman found a high demand for his services among the society elite. At this time, he married an Englishwoman, Hannah; she died and was buried on 27 January 1702. According to Arnold Houbraken, Closterman later took a mistress who stole much of his property and then left him. Her departure allegedly precipitated Closterman's physical and mental decline.Kloosterman biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Jacob Campo Weyerman, who took much of his biographical material from Houbraken, states \\"Closterman had taken a beautiful mistress who, while he was away in the country, robbed him of his valuables and disappeared, actions which drove the painter into madness\\".'Closterman, John', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, retrieved 11 September 2007 Closterman died in 1711 and was buried in Covent Garden churchyard in London. Works Queen Anne, c. 1702 Daniel Parke II by John Closterman, oil on canvas, 1706, in the collection of the Virginia Historical Society In 1702, Closterman painted a whole-length portrait of Anne, Queen of Great Britain in her coronation robes, wearing a crown, and carrying the orb and sceptre. The Queen Anne portrait was originally exhibited in the Guildhall in London. The portrait has disappeared, but a study is part of the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London. Closterman also painted a family portrait of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and his wife, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, with their five children: John Churchill, Marquess of Blandford, Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough, Lady Ann, Lady Elizabeth, and Lady Mary Churchill. In the Churchill portrait, the family is assembled beneath a rich hanging curtain on a raised dais; all the figures are lifesize. Closterman probably painted the portrait around the beginning of 1698. Closterman supposedly had so many disputes with Sarah Churchill that her husband remarked, \\"It has given me more trouble to reconcile my wife and you than to fight a battle\\". The story is told by Horace Walpole.H. Walpole (ed. R.N. Wornum), Anecdotes of Painting in England, with Some Account of the Principal Artists, 3 vols (Henry G. Bohn, London 1849), II, pp. 606-07. The Churchill portrait is now part of the collection at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. Identity For many years John Closterman and his artist brother John Baptist Closterman have been conflated in biographies, such as those in the Dictionary of National Biography and the Encyclopedia Britannica. An article by J. D. Stewart in The Burlington Magazine sets the record straight, citing John Closterman's will, which left part of his estate to \\"my Deare and Loveing Brother John Baptist\\".\\"John and John Baptist Closterman: some documents\\", in The Burlington Magazine, 106 (1964), 306‚Äì9 Notes References * External links  * John and John Baptist Closterman: french website Category:1660 births Category:1711 deaths Category:17th-century German painters Category:German male painters Category:18th-century German painters Category:German portrait painters Category:German emigrants to England Category:People from Osnabr√ºck ","title":"John Closterman"},{"id":"13075961","text":"Corny Point can refer to: * Corny Point (South Australia), a headland * Corny Point, South Australia, a settlement east of the headland * Corny Point Lighthouse, a lighthouse in South Australia ","title":"Corny Point"},{"id":"13075962","text":"George Dickey (1915‚Äì1976) was a Major League Baseball player.

Mar√≠n further suggested that the ashy-tailed swift was identical to Vaux's swift of the subspecies aphanes. If following this approach, andrei (with aphanes as a junior synonym) becomes a subspecies of Vaux's swift. This, however, is considered mistaken by Restall et al.

Martin served in the French Resistance during World War II and later fought with the French paratroopers in Indochina. Theatrically, he is perhaps best known for originating two roles in Samuel Beckett's most famous plays: Lucky in Waiting for Godot, and Clov in Endgame. During the 1950s, he was a performer at the Th√©√¢tre National Populaire and also worked for radio plays. Making over eighty film and television appearances, Martin is probably best remembered by international audiences for his role as the French paratroop commander Col. Mathieu in The Battle of Algiers (1965), as the gunslinger Sullivan in Sergio Leone's My Name is Nobody and as the laconic OAS adjutant Viktor Wolenski in The Day of the Jackal (both 1973). He had one of the lead roles in the 1968 French mini-series Les Compagnons de Baal. Most of his other screen work was in French or European cinema, though his stage performances gained him much more recognition and acclaim. Martin was also an active political leftist, and was fired from the Th√©√¢tre National Populaire for signing the manifesto of the 121 against the Algerian War. He was also blacklisted from radio work and remained unemployed for a time as a result.Dans la peau d'un para, video interview of Jean Martin, DVD extras for The Battle of Algiers, French edition, Studiocanal, 2004 Martin was hired for The Battle of Algiers because director Gillo Pontecorvo was looking for a little-known professional actor to play the part of Col. Mathieu. Martin had by then worked extensively on stage, but had done just a few appearances on screen. Enjoying movie work and wishing to develop his film career, Martin tried for the part and was hired. Martin later explained that his working relationship with Pontecorvo on the set of The Battle of Algiers was often difficult, as the director otherwise hired non-professional actors for the film. Martin, as the film's only professional actor, was sometimes uncomfortable working with untrained performers, while Pontecorvo was worried that their acting styles might be too different from each other and work against the picture. Martin was ultimately very happy with the film. Jean Martin continued working on stage and on screen, playing a variety of supporting roles in French films and television productions. He also provided the voice of L'oiseau in the animation feature film Le Roi et l'oiseau. Martin died from cancer in Paris on 2 February 2009, aged 86.

The film studies people and places in Antarctica. It was released in North America on June 11, 2008, and distributed by THINKFilm. Synopsis Herzog and cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger go to Antarctica to meet people who live and work there and to capture footage of the continent's unique locations. Herzog's voiceover narration explains that his film will not be a typical Antarctica film about \\"fluffy penguins\\" but will explore the dreams of the people and the landscape. They begin at McMurdo Station and interview some maintenance and support workers as well as iceberg geologist Douglas MacAyeal. They travel next to a nearby seal camp supervised by zoologist Olav Oftedal. Next they join the film's composer/producer, research diver Henry Kaiser, at his diving camp and interview cell biologist Samuel Bowser and zoologist Jan Pawlowski. Kaiser and Bowser stage a rooftop guitar concert. Herzog and Zeitlinger return to McMurdo for some more interviews and visit the preserved original base of Ernest Shackleton. After some brief footage at the South Pole, Herzog interviews penguin scientist David Ainley. This footage includes a shot of a penguin marching in the wrong direction, walking to a certain death in the barren interior of the continent. Herzog and Zeitlinger next visit Mount Erebus and interview volcanologists. A unique sequence follows which was shot in tunnels deep below South Pole station carved from snow and ice. Various trinkets and mementos, including a can of Russian caviar and a whole frozen sturgeon, are placed in carved-out shelves in the ice walls and preserved by the extremely cold and dry air. On the slope of the volcano, Herzog and Zeitlinger explore ice caves formed by fumaroles. The film next visits the launch of a giant helium balloon used in a neutrino detection project (ANITA) and features an interview with physicist Peter Gorham. It concludes with some philosophical words from a maintenance worker and more footage from the fumarole ice caves and Kaiser's dives. Production Herzog was drawn to Antarctica after viewing underwater footage filmed by Henry Kaiser. Kaiser was working on music for Herzog's Grizzly Man and was showing the footage to a friend when Herzog noticed it.Herzog, Kaiser, Zeitlinger, DVD audio commentary for Encounters at the End of the World Kaiser had been to Antarctica on scientific diving expeditions, as well as with the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Artists and Writers Program for his \\"Slide Guitar Around the World\\" project.\\"Slide Guitar & Exorcism @ The South Pole\\", featurette on DVD release of Encounters at the End of the World Within two years, Herzog had released The Wild Blue Yonder, which made prominent use of Kaiser's footage. The film was shot in Antarctica as part of the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Artists and Writers Program. The entire film crew consisted of Herzog, who recorded all production sound, and cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger. The two went to Antarctica without any opportunity to plan filming locations or interview subjects, and had only seven weeks to conceive and shoot their footage. Herzog often met his interview subjects only minutes before he began shooting them. Filming in Antarctica is usually overseen by the National Science Foundation's media office, which approves and supervises all film productions. Because of Herzog's grant from the Artists and Writers Program, he was allowed to film with no minders or oversight from the NSF. This allowed them to film the \\"seal-bagging\\" footage, which is not typically deemed suitable for public release. The sound recordings of the seals were produced by Douglas Quin, a sound expert and professor at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, and another recipient of the Antarctic Artists and Writers grant. The film is dedicated to American critic Roger Ebert.Roger Ebert, A letter to Werner Herzog Release The film showed at the 2007 Telluride Film Festival,Program of the 2007 Telluride Film Festival and had its official premiere one week later on September 10 at the Toronto International Film Festival. It also showed in 2008 at the International Documentary Festival in Amsterdam; the Edinburgh International Film Festival; the Cambridge Film Festival and the Melbourne International Film Festival.

Life and work Born in a middle- class family in Morlaix, Finist√®re, he studied law in Rennes then in Paris, becoming a Doctor of Law in 1901. A supporter of Alfred Dreyfus, he resigned from the bar of Paris, and registered with the bar of Morlaix, but practiced only rarely. He later became Justice of the Peace in Plouescat, Finist√®re. He belonged to the urban middle-class and French-speaking, anticlerical and republican faction, which was organized from 1899 in the Association des Bleus de Bretagne (Association of Breton Blues). In March 1900, he created with Charles Brunelli√®re the Socialist Federation of Brittany, at a congress in Nantes. He became very active as a political journalist in the journal Breton Socialiste which was succeeded by R√©veil du Finist√®re, in which he developed a legislative programme for republican and socialist rural politics. A freethinking Socialist, he wrote a number of critical studies of the historical myths created by the nationalistic and often reactionary \\"Breton movement\\". These were published as the book La Bretagne agenouill√©e (Brittany on its Knees). He left the socialist International in 1911 for radicalism and devoted himself thereafter to literature. He is now known primarily for his literary works and journalism, such as the Celtic Tales, the Barbarian Trilogy and especially Land of Priests. He ran the journal Breton Thought from 1913 to 1925. An official of Court of Appeal at Amiens after World War I, Yves Le Febvre became president of the Supporters of Morally Abandoned Children of the Somme, becoming very active in the group's role in assisting neglected and criminalised children who were victims of the devastation caused by the war. Publications * La Terre des Pr√™tres (Land of Priests), 1924. Le Febvre expected that this work would scandalize the clergy, but not to the extent that it did, including a long lawsuit and numerous attacks on him.

He founded the Union Steam Ship Company in Dunedin in 1875. Biography Mills was born in Wellington and raised in Dunedin. He worked for Johnny Jones, starting as a shop assistant and working his way up to managing Jones' Harbour Steam Company. After Jones' death in 1869 he became the leading trustee of his estate. Between 1869 and 1871 he built up a shareholding in the Harbour Steam Company until he was able to control the company. He floated the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand in 1875 with backing from Scottish shipbuilder Peter Denny in return for orders for his Dumbarton shipyard. The Union Company (as it was known) became a major shipping line, with a near-monopoly on trans-Tasman shipping, and was referred to as the \\"Southern Octopus\\". By 1914 it had 75 ships. It was the biggest shipping line in the southern hemisphere and New Zealand's largest private-sector employer. Mills sold the Union Company to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O;) in 1917. He represented Waikouaiti on the Otago Provincial Council in 1870, and again from 1873 to 1876. Later, he represented the electorate in Parliament from a by-election in to 1893, when he retired. He was knighted in 1907, and appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1909. It was said in a tribute to Mills that these distinctions made him the first native-born, non-indigenous New Zealander to be so honoured. He died in London on 23 January 1936, aged 88, having been a UK resident since 1907. He is buried in Putney Vale Cemetery, south west London.See: Grave of Sir James Mills, Putney Vale Cemetery.

Diseases with ATA are autoimmune disease because they react with self- proteins. They are also referred to as anti-DNA topoisomerase I antibody (anti-topo I). Epitopes and subtypes Anti Scl-70 antibodies (also called anti-topoisomerase I after the type I topoisomerase target) is a type of anti- nuclear autoantibody seen mainly in diffuse systemic scleroderma, but is also seen the more limited form of systemic scleroderma called CREST syndrome.Table 5-9 in: 8th edition. However, CREST syndrome is more closely associated with anti-centromere antibodies.JB Imboden, DB Hellmann, JH Stone. Current Rheumatology Diagnosis & Treatment, Second Edition. McGraw-Hill, 2007. Scl-70 antibodies are associated with more severe scleroderma disease. Anti- topoisomerase antibodies can be classified according to their immunoglobulin class (IgM, IgG or IgA). IgG-ATA is found most frequently in scleroderma, with IgA being quite common but IgM very infrequent. Pathology Topoisomerase I is an enzyme that relaxes the strain on DNA by nicking and ligating the DNA. ATA inhibits the activity of this enzyme. Since this activity occurs in the nucleus of the cell ATA is a form of anti-nuclear antibody. Scleroderma results from the overproduction of collagen in affected tissues, one study claims that there is an increased density of Topoisomerase I sites in the collagen genes, and that the antibodies may be altering transcription at these loci. ATA correlates with rapid progression of disease. In systemic lupus erythematosus ATA are associated with nephritis. Increases in ATA+ in scleroderma and SLE are associated with increases in serum CTLA4. Genetics HLA-DR2 (DR15 and DR16) are associated with Scleroderma and systemic sclerosis. It has been found that patients with ATA that recognize the ET4 domain of topoisomerase were frequently HLA-DR2, and in another population study it was found that DR-15 is associated with ATA in systemic sclerosis. In addition to HLA-DR, the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (lymphoid) (1p13.2 - ), \\"CT/TT\\" genotype showed significant association with anti-topo I. The gene (6p21.3, HLA complex) has also been found in association with ATA+ sclerosis.

Mourant graduated from the University of Oxford with honours in chemistry and a Doctor of Philosophy in geology in 1931. He was an early advocate of the then discredited Wegener theory of continental drift, which subsequently gained acceptability as plate tectonics. When he left Oxford he failed to find a position in his chosen discipline and returned to his childhood home of Jersey, where he set up a pathology laboratory. He later studied medicine and surgery at St Bartholomew's Medical College, London, joining the Galton Laboratory Serum Unit in 1946 and then founding the Blood Group Reference Laboratory in London, where he was director for 20 years. He pioneered a study of hematology of the worldwide distribution of blood groups. This work help build the genetic map of the world by studying and classifying blood groups across many populations and ethnic groups. His book, The Distribution of the Human Blood Groups, definitively drew together current knowledge on blood groups and their distribution. It launched anthropology on a new scientific basis as it described the genetic evidence for biological relationships, and allowed theories of population genetics to be developed and examined. This had far-reaching effects on medicine, research into genetic diseases, blood transfusion, and public health. Mourant also studied the new blood group antigens of the Lewis, Henshaw, Kell, and Rhesus systems, biological polymorphisms, and animal serological characteristics for fish stocks and cattle breeds. Amongst his many honours and recognitions, he gained a Fellowship of the Royal Society, the Huxley Memorial Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Landsteiner Memorial Award of the American Association of Blood Banks and honorary member of the Human Biology Council.

It is a remake of a 1970s novel of the same name by Toyoko Yamasaki. Takuya Kimura received widespread acclaim for his work in the series. The last episode of the series, \\"Finale Part II\\", is the highest rated episode of any Japanese drama in 2007. Plot Set in the post-World War II climate of the 1960s in Kobe, the show explores the struggle for power within the powerful Manpyo family. The cornerstone of their empire is , controlled by the father of the clan, . Eldest son is the managing director of . The ambitious Teppei seeks to expand operations of his company, and goes to his father to see if he can secure a loan. But the Minister of Finance seeks the merger of smaller Japanese banks to fend off foreign competition. Daisuke must decide whether to protect his son's interest in manufacturing or to ensure the survival of the bank that he controls. The series mostly revolves on the hidden secrets within the Manpyo family. A running theme throughout the show is Teppei's constant hunger for his father's approval. However, instead of being seen as a son, he is often seen as a threat by his own father. Throughout most of the series, they are competing as Daisuke refuses to help in Teppei's struggles. At the end, we are shown why the characters act as they did. Teppei's mother was supposedly raped by his grandfather, therefore, making Daisuke unsure if Teppei was actually his, or Keisuke's (his father). Teppei's uncanny resemblance to Keisuke, and his blood type proves to Daisuke that he was, indeed, his half-brother. This causes the heartache that surrounds the Manpyo family. Teppei's company is not saved. As he finds out that he was not actually who he thought he was, he goes to the mountains where his family hunts. He makes a final call to his wife. The next morning, Teppei leaves a suicide note and shoots himself. When the Manpyo family learns about Teppei's death, his mother is distraught. His father however, seems placid and cold. A man then comes in and asks the parents to sign Teppei's death certificate. Daisuke notices that they had made a mistake in the certificate, he states that they had Teppei's blood type wrong. The man informs them that the blood test was wrong. This revelation drives Teppei's mother into a fit. Daisuke is weakened. The man he thought to be a product of his father's horrible actions, was in fact, his own son. He is even more remorseful when he reads Teppei's suicide letter. Finally, Teppei is given the acceptance that he so long craved for.

He took up the sport in 1975. He won a complete set of medals at the FIBT World Championships with a gold in four-man (1977), a silver in two-man (1978, and a bronze in four-man (1978). He also took a silver in the European Championships in 1978 in the four-man event. Bethge also competed at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, finishing fourth in the four-man event and seventh in the two-man event. Prior to his role in bobsleigh, Bethge was national champion in the 110 metres hurdles in 1969, and finished fifth in the event at the 1969 European Championships in Athletics in Athens. He also won East German national titles in the 110 metres hurdles and the indoor 55 metres hurdles in 1969 and as part of a successful 4 √ó 100 metres relay team in 1970. Bethge was forced to retire from bobsleigh in 1979 following a bus accident. That same year he took up coaching, initially as an assistant club coach at the Oberhof track. He became a trainer for the bobsleigh federation in East Germany, then for unified Germany after East and West Germany reunified in 1990. One of the athletes he trained was Wolfgang Hoppe, who would later become a coach for the German team. Another would be Christoph Langen, another successful bobsledder who was appointed as coach of the German team in 2010. Bethge was named trainer of the year in Germany in 2006 by the German Olympic Sports Confederation as a result of his successes that included 80 men's bobsleigh medals overall (Winter Olympics, World championship, and European championship), 11 women's bobsleigh medals overall, and 11 skeleton medals overall. He donated the ‚Ç¨10,000 prize money to the German Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton Federation to fund youth development. He was able to attend the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin despite breaking both of his legs after being hit by an Australian bobsled during a practice run at Cesana Pariol on 30 November 2005. Bethge was planning to avoid travelling to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver due to health problems arising from these injuries, but after the whole German team appealed to him to reconsider by wearing \\"Raimund for Whistler\\" t-shirts at a World Cup race in St. Moritz he agreed to attend the Games. He retired from coaching in August 2010. Bethge is the half-brother of the sports shooter Bernhard Hochwald and Katja Klepp is his sister-in-law.

The western edge, now called Ensign Street, was previously called Well Street. The southern edge was called Neptune street. On the north side is Graces Alley, home to Wilton's Music Hall. The centre of the square is occupied by St Paul's Whitechapel Church of England Primary School. On the western edge is another primary school.  Early history  The abbey of St Mary Graces stood near Tower Hill until the dissolution of the monasteries. An old map shows a river running down each side of \\"Nightingall Lane\\" (now called Thomas More Street). In 1954 Kenneth Reid suggested this was one of London's \\"lost rivers\\" and that it ran from Well Street into the Thames. Daniel Defoe mentions the square is his book \\"A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain\\" (1724). He says that there used to be a well in the centre of the square. It was also known as Goodman's Field's Well.  Governance  Wellclose Square was part of the ancient parish of Stepney. This was later divided into Whitechapel (by 1329), Wapping (1694) and St George in the East (1729). The boundaries of the parishes met in Wellclose Square. In 1686 the Tower Liberty was extended beyond the Tower of London to include Minories, the Old Artillery Ground and Wellclose. The word \\"Wellclose\\" was used to indicate the whole area until the middle of the nineteenth century.  Notable Persons  Caius Gabriel Cibber was the architect of the Danish church, built in the centre of the Square in 1696. He was the father of the playwright Colley Cibber. According to the website www.poetsgravesco.uk, Colley Cibber was buried in either this church, or Grosvenor chapel, Mayfair. The church was demolished in 1870. The Danish Church was depicted in paintings many times. Swedenborg Gardens The scientist and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg (1688‚Äì1772) lived in the square during the last year of his life. When Swedenborg came from Sweden to London in 1710, he attended the Swedish church in Princes Square, which used to be located to the east of Wellclose Square. The area is now called Swedenborg Gardens, and the tower block overlooking Wellclose Square is called Stockholm House. Swedenborg arrived in the same year as the Ulrika Eleonora Church was built in Princes Square. He was buried there. It closed in 1910, and in 1912/13 his remains were transferred to Uppsala Cathedral in Sweden. The church was demolished in 1921. Hayyim Samuel Jacob Falk (1708‚Äì1782), a Rabbi and Kabbalist, moved to Wellclose Square in 1742 after narrowly escaping being burnt at the stake by the authorities in Westphalia who charged him with sorcery. He was known as the \\"Baal Shem of London\\" because of his reputation as a practical Kabbalist who worked miracles and appeared to have magical powers. Thomas Day (1748‚Äì1789) was born in Wellclose Square. He was a poet who wrote, with John Bicknell, The Dying Negro about the death of a runaway slave. Later he wrote The History of Sandford and Merton (1783). John Thomas Quekett (1815 - 1861) was a pioneering histologist. His brother Edwin lived at 50 Wellclose Square. John moved in with his brother. In 1839 John founded the Royal Microscopical Society. He was conservator of the Hunterian Museum until his death. Dr Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward (1791 - 1868) invented the terrarium (a dry version of an aquarium). He invented it about 1829, because his ferns were being poisoned by the London air. It also went by the name Wardian case. Starting in 1857, William Smith and Charles Eaton made lead-cast forgeries of antiquities. The letters were meaningless jumbles, which made them easy to detect as forgeries. A dealer in the city Road bought many of them. Charles Eaton died in 1879 in Wellclose Square.  Notable Places  Wellclose prison cell wall, with graffiti dated 1757, preserved at the Museum of London. There are unusual bollards on Ensign Street, with the mark \\"RBT\\". The initials stand for \\"Royal Brunswick Theatre\\". The Royalty was built there in 1787 by John Palmer. John Braham (1774‚Äì1856) sang at the Royalty in the same year that it opened, at the age of 14. It was burnt down in 1828. The \\"Royal Brunswick\\" was built in its place in 1828. It collapsed almost as soon as it had been built, on 28 February 1828. The Neptune Street Prison became familiarly known in the district as 'The Sly House'. Also known as Wellclose prison, its remaining structures have now been preserved inside the Museum of London, where one can see the names of prisoners, scratched on the wooden wall panels by prisoners using pine cones.  The Red Ensign club  Following the destruction of the \\"Royal Brunswick Theatre\\" Rev George Smith of the Methodist Mariners church on Dock Street decided to build a sailors' home on the site. It was founded in 1830 and opened in 1835, with accommodation for 100 sailors. This was later expanded to 500. The main entrance was originally on Well Street, but later changed to be on Dock Street. The London Nautical School opened here in 1893. In 1955 it was modernised and renamed the \\"Red Ensign Club\\". Following the decline of the British Merchant Fleet, it closed in 1974. It is now a youth club. Well Street was renamed Ensign Street in honour of the hostel. According to John Stape's biography \\"The Several Lives of Joseph Conrad\\", Conrad first lived in this sailor's home at the age of 21, and returned several times. There was a sugar refinery at the bottom of Dock Street and Well Street. It is mentioned by Charles Dickens in \\"The Uncommercial Traveller\\". According to Roy Palmer, one version of the sea shanty \\"Tiger Bay\\" makes reference to \\"Well Street\\", and suggests it was the one by Wellclose Square. (see \\"The Oxford Book of Sea Songs\\" 1986).

Description It grows as a prostrate little-branched shrub, the stems densely covered in slender, pointed leaves from seven to 30 millimetres long, and 0.5 to 0.8 millimetres wide. Although prostrate, it has erect flower stalks that give it a height of up to a metre. Inflorescence with numerous clusters of tubular, wooly, white flowers, 6mm long, in winter to spring and occur in elongated panicles. Compounds from this plant are currently being investigated for medicinal use. Taxonomy It was first published in John Lindley's 1839 A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony, based on unspecified material. Its taxonomic history since that time has been entirely without incident, with neither synonyms nor infrageneric taxa being published. In 1995, Eleanor Bennett published a treatment of Conospermum for the Flora of Australia series of monographs, placing C. incurvum in Conospermum subg. Conospermum, sect. Eriostachya, subsect. Multibracteata. It is the type species of the subsection. Its closely relative is C. brachyphyllum, from which it may be distinguished by its more densely clustered leaves. Distribution and habitat It occurs in undulating sandplains of white, grey or yellow/brown sand over laterite, ranging from Eneabba south to Perth. Thus it primarily occurs in the Swan Coastal Plain and Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic regions. There are also some outlying populations in the Avon Wheatbelt and Jarrah Forest regions, and a single population in the Esperance Plains region north of Albany. Ecology It is not considered threatened.

Birket began his career with Liverpool, but did not make any appearances for the Anfield club before leaving to join Blackpool on 28 July 1896.ROBERT KIRKHAM BIRKET (ROBERT KIRKHAM) - PlayUpLiverpool.com He made his debut for Blackpool on 14 November 1896, in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Lincoln City at Raikes Hall. He scored the hosts' first goal. That was his only appearance in the 1896‚Äì97 campaign. Birket made fourteen league appearances the following season, 1897‚Äì98, scoring eight goals. In 1898‚Äì99, he was the club's top scorer with fifteen goals in his 24 appearances. His efforts were not enough to keep Blackpool in the Football League, however: they failed to be re-elected, along with Darwen. In Blackpool's one season in League exile, 1899‚Äì90, Birket became the first Blackpool to score a hat-trick. It came against Darwen on 16 November 1899. He also scored five in a Boxing Day victory over Stockport County and four against Wigan Athletic on 17 March 1900. Birket continued his scoring ways for Blackpool's first season back in the Football League, with ten strikes, again finishing as the club's top scorer. For the second half of the 1901‚Äì02 campaign, Birket was moved to the right-back position. As to be expected his goals dried up and he found the net only twice in his 26 appearances. He continued in the right-back berth for the remainder of his career, with the majority of his infrequent goals coming from the penalty spot. Birket played his last game on 22 September 1906, just four games into Blackpool's 1906‚Äì07 campaign. Death Birket died in 1933 in Blackpool at the age of 58.

She was born free, but was later enslaved by the king of Limmu- Ennarea. She was emancipated in 1886 when Italian ships intercepted a boat which was taking her to be sold on the Arabian Peninsula, then took her to Eritrea where the Imkullu school of the Swedish Evangelical Mission took her in. Aster (by Ethiopian custom, she is referred to by her first name) was educated at their school. Onesimos quickly ‚Äúdiscovered that Aster was endowed with considerable mental gifts and possessed a real feeling for the Oromo language‚Äù (Ar√©n 1978:383). She was assigned to compile an Oromo dictionary, which was first used in polishing a translation of New Testament published in 1893. Aster also translated a book of Bible stories and wrote down 500 traditional Oromo riddles, fables, proverbs, and songs, many of which were published in a volume for beginning readers (1894). She later worked with Onesimos in compiling an Oromo hymnbook. Ar√©n reports that a large amount of folklore she collected is still unpublished, preserved by the Hylander family (Ar√©n 1978:384, fn. 71). Aster and Onesimos completed translating the complete Bible into Oromo, which was printed in 1899. The title page and history credit Onesimos as the translator, but it appears that Aster's contribution was not, and still is not, adequately appreciated.Senai Wolde Andemariam. 2013.

Biography  He was born in Alicante, the seventh of eight children in a middle-class family. His first artistic studies were at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos de Valencia, where he won first prize for painting in 1793. After that, he attended the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. In 1796, his painting of Manuel Godoy presenting Peace (the Peace of Basel) to King Carlos IV won him a grant from the King to study in Paris and Rome.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado. In Paris, he was the first Spanish student of Jacques-Louis David. He won a gold medal for his painting \\"The Yellow Fever in Valencia\\" in 1805.Brief biography @ the Diccionario de Pintores Alicantinos. He went to Rome in 1807 and, on several occasions, refused to swear allegiance to the new King, Joseph I. Because of this, he and other like-minded Spaniards there were virtual prisoners at the Castel Sant'Angelo, until Ferdinand was restored to the throne in 1813.Brief biography @ Los Ensayos. After regaining his freedom, he was recalled to Spain and arrived there in 1815. After a few months, he settled in Madrid, having been appointed a court painter to Ferdinand. A year later, he began painting \\"The Glories of Spain\\", which would occupy him for two years. This was the first of a long series of works on patriotic themes. For his best-known work, \\"The Landing of Ferdinand VII at the Port of Santa Mar√≠a\\", he was named an \\"Academician of Merit\\" at the Academia de San Carlos in 1829. Later, he became the Director of the Academia de San Fernando. In addition to historical paintings, he was noted for his portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and military officers. Following Ferdinand's death in 1833, he fell out of favor with the new Liberal government, as he was considered to be a propagandist for the King. After a bout with pneumonia, he was forced into retirement and awarded a nominal pension, although he apparently had to fight to receive his payments on schedule. He died in poverty in Madrid, aged 64.

The third ship to be named Aroostook by the Navy, AOG-14 was originally built at Newport News, Virginia, as the single-screw, steel-hulled, diesel-electric, tank barge Esso Delivery No. 11 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. Launched on 8 December 1937, she was delivered to the Standard Oil Co., of New Jersey, on 8 February 1938 and was homeported at Baltimore, Maryland, over the next few years. Acquired by the Navy from the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 1 April 1943, Esso Delivery No. 11 - the first all-welded construction tanker owned by Standard Oil - was renamed Aroostook, classified as a gasoline tanker, and designated AOG-14. The ship arrived at the Key Highway plant of Bethlehem Steel Corp., Baltimore, on 3 April 1943 and after conversion for naval service, was commissioned there on 18 April 1943, Lt. Alfred O. Johansen, USNR, in command.  World War II service  Getting underway for Norfolk, Virginia, on the 21st, Aroostook tarried there only briefly before sailing on 28 April to join United States Naval Forces, Northwest African Waters. Proceeding via Bermuda and Gibraltar, she reached Oran, Tunisia, one month later to commence operations in that theater. For the rest of her career under the American flag the gasoline tanker operated in the Mediterranean basin. Her ports of call included Bari, Isola Santo Stefano, Civitavecchia, Taranto, Piombino, Livorno, Palermo and Naples, Italy, as well as the island of Malta.  Under attack by the Luftwaffe  Only once during the entire period did she come in contact with the enemy. While she lay at Bari, Italy, on 2 December 1943, the German Luftwaffe raided that port. The ship sustained concussion and shrapnel damage when an ammunition ship exploded nearby, but she suffered no casualties among her men.  Decommissioning  Decommissioned on 18 January 1945 at Bizerte, the ship was transferred to the French government the following day. Renamed Lac Pavin she served with the French Navy under lend-lease for four more years. Sold outright to the French Government on 21 March 1949, Aroostook was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 April 1949. Ultimately, Lac Pavin was scrapped in 1953.

Participatory impact pathways analysis (PIPA) is a project management approach in which the participants in a project (project and program are used synonymously from now on), including project staff, key stakeholders, and the ultimate beneficiaries, together co-construct their program theory. Participatory Impact Pathways Analysis (PIPA)  Overview  The PIPA theory describes plausible impact pathways by which project outputs are used by others to achieve a chain of outcomes leading to a contribution to eventual impact on social, environmental or economic conditions. Impact pathways are a type of logic model, that is, they constitute a model that describes the logic of what the project will do, is doing, or what it did. PIPA helps workshop participants identify, discuss, and write down assumptions and theories about how the project activities and outputs could contribute to project goals. The description of these assumptions and theories is a description of the project‚Äôs impact pathways. PIPA has helped workshop participants to: * Clarify and communicate the project‚Äôs logic of intervention and its potential for achieving impact * Understand other projects and identify areas for collaboration * Generate a feeling of common purpose and better programmatic integration * Produce an impact narrative describing the project's intervention logic * Produce a framework for subsequent monitoring and evaluation  History  PIPA was first used in a workshop in January 2006 in Ghana, with seven projects funded by the \\"Challenge Program on Water and Food\\". Nine PIPA workshops have been held since then for 46 projects. Researchers from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture,International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT - Spanish acronym) WorldFish Center,WorldFish Center and International Potato CenterInternational Potato Center (CIP - Spanish acronym) are developing PIPA. PIPA developed from innovation historiesinnovation histories and work carried out by the Institutional Learning and Change Initiative.Institutional Learning and Change Initiative A paper describing PIPA was accepted for publication in the Canadian Journal of Program Evaluation.  PIPA topics   PIPA projects  PIPA is useful when two or more projects in the same program wish to better integrate. At least two people for each project should attend, preferably the project leader and someone else who knows the project and has time and inclination to follow up on what comes out of the workshop. PIPA also works well when one project wishes to build up common understanding and commitment from its stakeholders. In this case, two or more representatives from each important stakeholder group should attend.  PIPA process  PIPA can be used at the beginning of a project, in the middle or at the end as way of documenting and learning from the project. PIPA describes project (or program) impact pathways in two ways: (i) causal chains of activities, outputs and outcomes through which a project is expected to achieve its purpose and goal; and (ii) networks of evolving relationships between project implementing organizations, stakeholders and ultimate beneficiaries that are necessary to achieve the goal. The workshop process, shown in the diagram, develops the two perspectives in turn and then integrates them.  PIPA Workshop  Drawing a project's network in a PIPA workshop The workshop begins with participants developing a problem tree that links the project goal framed in terms of a challenge or problem to what the project is actually going to do. The approach used for developing the problem tree is based on work by Renger and Titcombe (2003). The problem tree helps participants clarify the key problems / opportunities their projects are addressing, and the outputs (things others will use) that their projects need to produce. Participants then carry out a visioning exercise, which borrows from appreciative inquiry, to describe project success two years after the project's conclusion based on the adoption and use of project outputs. These three steps (see diagram) usually take about a day to complete and provide the information needed to describe a causal chain of outcomes needed to achieve success. The second part of the workshop involves drawing the networks of people and organizations who are already working in the area and then drawing the networks that will be needed to achieve the project vision. Analyzing the differences between the two can help identify an effective communication strategy. The final step is to integrate the causal chain and the network perspectives by drawing a timeline. Optionally, monitoring and evaluation can be discussed by identifying SMART criteria (specific, measurable, attributable, realistic, and time-bound) to measure expected change, and by identifying \\"most significant change\\" to pick up unexpected ones. A key component of any evaluation plan is that project staff periodically revisit their vision, problem trees, and network maps to update them, identify necessary changes to the timeline, and document the changes.  After the workshop  The information from PIPA workshops has been used in a number of ways: * At a minimum a clean record is kept of the workshop outputs to provide impact hypotheses for any future impact evaluation and to help communicate the project's rationale. * The evaluators who run the workshops have worked with project staff to write impact narratives similar to John Mayne‚Äôs (2004) performance stories, that explains the logic of the project intervention in a narrative form as writing a coherent narrative can surface otherwise hidden assumptions. * The information from the network maps has been processed using social network analysis software Ucinet and NetDraw to produce composite maps that show which CPWF projects are working with which organizations.http://www.analytictech.com/ These maps help the basin coordinators do their job.

The National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA), a Greek Cypriot right-wing nationalist guerrilla organisation, began an armed campaign in support of the end of British colonial rule and the unification of Cyprus and Greece (Enosis) in 1955. Opposition to Enosis from Turkish Cypriots led to the formation of the Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT) in support of the partition of Cyprus. The Cyprus Emergency ended in 1959 with the signature of the London-Z√ºrich Agreements, establishing the Republic of Cyprus as a non- partitioned independent state separate from Greece. History Background Cyprus was a territory of the Ottoman Empire from the late 16th century until becoming a protectorate of the United Kingdom under nominal Ottoman suzerainty in the Cyprus Convention of 4 June 1878, following the Russo-Turkish War. In 1915, Cyprus was formally annexed into the British Empire after the Ottomans entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers against the British, and was initially governed by a military administration until a decade later in 1925 when it was proclaimed the Crown Colony of Cyprus. From the 1910s to 1950s, Greek Cypriots became increasingly dissatisfied with British rule and supportive of Enosis, the concept of political unification between Cyprus and Greece. Several unsuccessful offers made to Greece by the British to cede Cyprus in exchange for military concessions, and the noticeable lack of British investment on the island, caused a growing Cypriot nationalist movement. In 1954, Britain announced its intention to transfer its Suez military headquarters (the office of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East)Richard J. Aldrich, Ming-Yeh Rawnsley, The Clandestine Cold War in Asia, 1945‚Äì65: Western Intelligence, Propaganda and Special Operations, Routledge, 2013, 106. to Cyprus. Insurgency On 1 April 1955, the EOKA insurgency began with 1 April Attacks. After a series of follow up incidents, the Governor General Sir John Harding declared a state of emergency on 26 November of that year. The British encountered great difficulty obtaining effective intelligence on EOKA as the majority of the Greek Cypriot population supported them. They were also hampered by a drain on manpower caused by the Suez Crisis and Malayan Emergency. Towards the end of the 1950s, the British enjoyed more success. Cyprus became an independent republic in 1960 with Britain retaining control of two Sovereign Base Areas, at Akrotiri and Dhekelia. In January 2019, the British government agreed to pay ¬£1 million to a total of 33 Cypriots who were allegedly tortured by British forces during the uprising. They included a woman, aged 16 at the time, who said she was detained and repeatedly raped by soldiers, and a man who lost a kidney as a result of his interrogation. The payout followed the declassification of government documents in 2012, although Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan stated that \\"the settlement does not constitute any admission of liability\\" but that \\"the government has settled the case in order to draw a line under this litigation and to avoid the further escalation of costs\\".

The urban area of Esperg√¶rde also covers the two former villages Tibberup and M√∏rdrup and part of the former fishing village of Skotterup, with 11.524 inhabitants (2008).Statistikbanken Tabel BEF 44 - of who 11.458 lives inside Helsing√∏r municipality and 66 in the neighboring Fredensborg municipality Esperg√¶rde is well limited to the north by Egeb√¶ksvang forest and Flynderupg√•rd, to the west by Rolighedsmoserne (swamp area) and Helsing√∏rmotorvejen (motorway or highway), to the south by Krogerup mansion fields and Babyloneskoven (Babylone forest). Esperg√¶rde is part of Region Hovedstaden (the capital area). Esperg√¶rde has its own postal number, 3060, and is split in two parishes: Egeb√¶ksvang Parish (church nearby the old fishermans village) and M√∏rdrup Parish (church next to the urban centre).  History  Esperg√¶rde in about 1860 The name is first documented in 1555 as Esperegierde. The first part of the name refers to an older village, Asper√∏d, meaning \\"clearing in an aspen forest\\"=. - g(k)√¶rde means \\"fenced\\". The original village consisted only of two or three farms located at the top of the coastal cliff. In about 1500, a fishing village with 6-8 houses developed on the beach. A road along the coast connected it to Skotterup and Snekkersten) to the north and Humleb√¶k, Sletten) to the south. From Esperg√¶rde a road travelled inland to the village of M√∏rdrup situated about 2 km from the coast. According to the land tax registration 1682, 4 fishermen had reserved parts of the coastal area for fishing eel in √òresound, for which they had to pay 2 Danish rigsdaler in land taxes per year; 2 areas were \\"√∏de\\" (out of use). 6 houses without land had to pay 1 rigsdaler in land taxes. Esperg√¶rde, together with the villages M√∏rdrup and Tibberup, belonged to the mansion Krogerup situated to the south. The farmers in these villages had to make hoveri (farm work) for the mansion, and the road from M√∏rdrup to the south towards Tibberup (and from here further on to Krogerup) still has the name \\"Hovvej\\", referring to these conditions. Krogerup mansion was pne of few private estates in North Zealand which mainly belonged to the crown.  Summer holiday area and railway town  During the years from 1841 to 1847 on 28 May there was a celebration recalling the starting of Provinsialst√¶nderne (Provincial represents council) similar to celebrations in other cities. The reason for this was that the radical representative, ship clarating N.P. Kinck won the election in Helsing√∏r on 8 January 1841 for the Provincial Represents Council for the Danish Islands over the conservative candidate. Egeb√¶ksvang was elected as the place to celebrate this victory partly because of request from rural residents. The first celebration brought together 5‚Äì6000 people from the area and Elsinore by Hvidestensbakken (White Stone Hill) in the forest, and also celebrations during the next years took place here. During Tre√•rskrigen (Three Year War) 1848-1850 in the Dutchies Slesvig-Holstein no celebrations took place and from 1852 the celebrations started up again but now in honour of the June 5-constitution; in honour of the constitution a stone monument was raised in the forest. The celebrations took place every year until 1855 and then came to a stop during some years. Instead the forest was used for parties for different purposes like building a harbour for the fishermen in Snekkersten and Esperg√¶rde, but also for other events. All these celebrations became well known and drew summer holiday guests to the area, including people from Copenhagen. A steam boat line was expanded to the north and from 1877 the steam boat made stops in Copenhagen and the villages along the coast: Skovshoved and Bellevue Beach, T√•rb√¶k, Skodsborg, Vedb√¶k, Rungsted, Humleb√¶k, Snekkersten, Helsing√∏r and Helsingborg. The same year a post line opened from Elsinore to Snekkersten, Skotterup and Egeb√¶ksro (on the fringe of the forest Egeb√¶ksvang just south of the small Egeb√¶kken stream running into The √òresound). The post coastline stopped after a short time but the summer holiday visitors continued to grow. Until the 1870s the visitors came mainly on day trips to the forest and the beach, but according to the law of business enterprise (n√¶ringsloven) of 1857 it was specifically allowed that house owners could rent their homes to foreign visitors and supply them with food, so the local people started to rent out their homes during the summer and themselves lived in a building for stocking materials, horse staples or other secondary purposes. Shortly after, summer cottages started to be built on areas next to the coast, the oldest being \\"Mary Hill\\" from 1848, the next \\"Hostruphus\\", built as a national gift in 1870 for the poet Christian Hostrup. During the 1870s and 1880s, the coastal area between Egeb√¶ksvang and √òresound became one of the most popular places for Copenhagen summer holiday visitors, and in 1880 a large part of the coast was already filled with summer cottages. The increasing number of summer visitors gave way to new enterprise. First, a large number of cottages were built, thus creating jobs for building workers. In 1850 there were only 3 building workers in Esperg√¶rde area, one in each of the villages Skotterup, M√∏rdrup and Tibberup. In 1870 there were 8 building workers. In 1880 already 18. In (?) the number of building workers had increased to 22. Also, the summer visitors gave new possibilities for trade, both for the farmers and fishermen, who were allowed to sell their own products, and for shop keepers like the store in Skotterup and the stores in Elsinore. At the end of the 19th Century the number of summer cottages grew quickly and from 1897, when Kystbanen (coastal rail road) was opened (with a station from 1903), about 1 km from Esperg√¶rde, a small town grew up, mainly of summer cottages. Now followed all kinds of shopkeepers and a bath hotel built in 1896 with the name hotel \\"Gefion\\" above the coastal slope and a great view to the fishermens village and the sea. More and more houses and summer cottages were built between the village and the railroad station on the southern side of Egeb√¶ksvang forest. Together with these houses came new craftsmen and traders, even some industrial production. However, most of the people went by train as commuters to Elsinore or Copenhagen, and at a time the Coastal Railroad was known as the \\"gross traders train\\" (grosserertoget). The development continued until World War II, and the fishermen's village became a true town, first with many summer holiday visitors, later as a residential area for people working in Elsinore or Copenhagen. In 1911 there were 500 people in the town, in 1916 713 people in 144 houses. Espergaerde features in the song \\"Denmark, 1943\\" by American folksinger Fred Small about the rescue of the Danish Jews: And it's fire up the diesel and look out for swells / We're leaving Espergaerde behind us / Who strike at our friends strike us as well / We'll pray the patrol boats don't find us / When the sirens are wailing and shouts fill the night / Never will you stand alone / So it's over the √òresund / Till the day we can welcome you home.  After WW2  In 1950 the inhabitants had grown to some 2600 people. In 1947 the first building plan was made in the local community with the proposal to build on the entire 2 km2 area from the coast to the inland villages, and during the 1960s this development took place. From 1960 to 1970 the number of inhabitants grew from 4,000 to 10,000 people. Because of this development Esperg√¶rde became the administrative centre of the local community. In 1970 the rural community was merged with Elsinore city, and Esperg√¶rde became a centre for the planning department. In 2009 Esperg√¶rde was officially considered to be connected to Elsinore, even if the two urban areas are still divided by a 100m (approx.) undeveloped area between Esperg√¶rde-Skotterup and Snekkersten-Helsing√∏r.  Road net and bus connections  From Esperg√¶rde there are two main roads heading inland and to the northwest. In the north M√∏rdrupvej (vej = road), passes the villages of Gurre and Nyg√•rd and ends in √Ölsg√•rde. To the south Hornb√¶kvej passes the villages of Kvistg√•rd and Tik√∏b and leads on to Hornb√¶k. The town has bus connections via these two roads to the towns of √Ölsg√•rde and Hornb√¶k, and a third bus connection via Strandvejen to Elsinore.  Railroad connections  Esperg√¶rde has railroad connections to Copenhagen and Elsinore via Kystbanen (Coast line), and to Hiller√∏d city and Elsinore via Nordbanen (Northern line) from the railroad station in M√∏rdrup.  Trade and service  The urban centre is Esperg√¶rde centret (centre),Esperg√¶rdecenterets hjemmeside Denmark's oldest planned centre, with shops, institutions, medical care, dentist, public library and lutheran church. At √òresund coast Esperg√¶rde has a harbour, Esperg√¶rde Havn,Esperg√¶rde Havn for yachts. It was planned to but never built into a marina. Esperg√¶rde is also the place for one of Denmark's biggest high schools, Esperg√¶rde Gymnasium & HF, which since the middle of the 1970s replaced Helsing√∏r Latinskole (Elsinore Latin school). On the high school there is every year an international conference,Esperg√¶rde Gymnasium Model United Nations (EGMUN) attracting several hundred pupils to the town.  Recreational areas  Both north and south of Esperg√¶rde are so-called green wedges. These forested or cultivated areas span out to the coast - or until the Strandvejen (Beach road). To the north are situated Egeb√¶ksvang (forest) and Flynderupg√•rd farm fields towards Snekkersten, to the south farm fields towards Krogerup and the town of Humleb√¶k. To the west the town is limited by the Rolighedsmoserne (a swamp area) and part of Kelleris Hegn (a forest) situated between Nordbanen (railroad) and Helsing√∏rmotorvejen (Elsinore motorway).

History Early beginnings The Singapore Income Tax Department was created in 1947 to administer the Income Tax Ordinance enacted during that year. Actual assessing of tax only began in November 1948. In the first Year of Assessment, about 40,000 individual tax returns and 1,000 corporate returns were received. The total tax collected for the period 1 January 1948 to 31 December 1949 was $33.2 million. 1960s Following self-government in 1959, the Inland Revenue Department was formed in 1960 when various revenues administered and collected by a number of separate agencies were brought together. When Singapore attained independence on 9 August 1965, substantial changes were made to the Income Tax Act, which came into effect on 1 January 1966. 1970s By this time, the number of Acts that came under the Department's purview had increased to twelve. That year also saw the appointment of the first local Commissioner, Mr Hsu Tse-Kwang. This period witnessed the growth of the service sector and substantial resources were devoted to staff training. In 1972, microfilming was stepped up to save space and reduce file handling. Property tax billing and collection were also computerised. 1980s Singapore became a more expensive place for businesses with the rapid developments. Changes were introduced to government policies, incentives and taxes in order to make the economy more competitive. The late 1980s witnessed a significant shift towards lowering both corporate and individual taxes. In 1987 corporate tax rates were lowered from 40% to 33%. 1990s This period witnessed major changes in tax policies. There was a shift towards lower direct taxes and the focus was on indirect taxes. The trend towards indirect taxation resulted in the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 1994. It is a tax on domestic consumption and applies to all goods and services supplied in Singapore except for financial services and residential properties. It was in this period that the trend of lowering corporate and individual tax rates accelerated. 2000 to 2010/2016 Investment and talent attraction policies have been the focus at present. Tax rates were further lowered and currently capped at 18% (till 2010 YA2010 for YE2009) for companies and 20% (till 2017 YA16) for individuals. 2010/2017 and beyond 17% companies and max 22% https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your- Taxes/Income-Tax-Rates/ for individuals Incorporation of IRAS On 1 September 1992, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) was established by legislation as a statutory board under the Ministry of Finance. With this conversion, IRAS was incorporated by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore Act to take over the functions previously performed by the Inland Revenue Department. The conversion was to give IRAS the autonomy and flexibility to manage its personnel and financial resources. Taxes administered by IRAS As the Singapore Government's principal revenue collection body, IRAS collects Income Tax, Goods and Services Tax (GST), Property Tax, Estate Duty, Betting and Sweepstakes Duties, Stamp Duties and Casino Tax. Blogging is taxable in Singapore if it constitute gains or profits from a trade or a business under section 10(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1947 (ITA). The other tax types in Singapore which are not collected by IRAS are: * Levies on motor vehicles (Land Transport Authority) * Customs and excise duties (Singapore Customs) * Foreign worker levy (Ministry of Manpower) * Water conservation tax (Public Utilities Board)  Initiatives  The Auto- Inclusion Scheme (AIS) enables employers to submit the employment income information of their employees to IRAS electronically. The information will then be automatically pre-filled in the employees' income tax assessment. Property owners with rental income may make claims on the total amount of their rental expenses. Alternatively, they may claim deemed rental expenses calculated based on 15% of the gross rent. In addition to the 15% deemed rental expenses, property owners may claim mortgage interest on the loan taken to purchase the tenanted property. Performance IRAS collected S$47 billion in tax revenue in FY2016/17. Tax arrears remained low at 0.68% of net tax assessed and cost of collection was also kept low at 0.84 cents for every dollar collected. In FY2016/17, IRAS uncovered 10,626 non-compliant cases and recovered about $332 million in taxes and penalties through rigorous audits and investigation. IRAS collected S$50.2 billion in tax revenue in FY2017/2018, which was an increase of 6.8 per cent from FY2016/2017.

A Jan Magnussen Stewart SF1, example of the range and depth of machinery in the collection. The Donington Grand Prix Collection, sometime known as the Donington Grand Prix Exhibition, was a museum of motor racing cars, based at the Donington Park motor racing circuit in Leicestershire, England. The collection, which started in the 1960s, began to deplete in the 2000s. The museum closed permanently on 5 November 2018 and its large collection to be sold away and dispersed.  Overview  With five halls and over 130 exhibits, the Donington Grand Prix Collection comprised the largest exhibition of Grand Prix cars in the world. The collection contained vehicles from many forms of open-wheel, single-seater racing, but was primarily focussed on Grand Prix and Formula One machinery. The museum was formed by the late Tom Wheatcroft in March 1973 and is based on Wheatcroft's personal collection of vehicles. These include some that Wheatcroft's own motor racing team ran for drivers such as Roger Williamson and Derek Bell, although many cars exhibited are on loan from other owners. Various external collections of automobilia and motor racing ephemera have been donated to the museum over the years. Specific attractions included the world's only complete collection of Vanwall cars, a near-complete collection of McLaren Formula One cars from the team's inception to the early 2000s, and extensive collections of Williams and BRM cars (including examples of both notorious BRM V16-powered machines as well as the H16-powered BRM P83). The collection also had examples of four different four-wheel drive Formula One cars, including an unraced Cosworth car. Another star exhibit was the Lotus 18 with which Stirling Moss won the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix, along with Jim Clark's World Championship-winning Lotus 25. Noticeable, however, was the distinct lack of Ferrari vehicles, 3 in all, but fine examples nonetheless. First being a Ferrari 312 driven by Chris Amon, second a 312B and thirdly, a Ferrari F2000 (the particular chassis driven to victory in the 2000 Canadian Grand Prix, one of nine victories for Michael Schumacher in his maiden championship winning series with Ferrari), conversely, the establishment housed the Jordan 191 in which he made his formula 1 debut in 1991. The 1998 Jordan 198, the most successful in Jordan's history, (the chassis being the one Damon Hill drove to victory in a 1-2 with team mate Ralf Schumacher at the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa Francorchamps) also figured. Another interesting exhibit was an Auto Union, built from pre-war plans following the factory's destruction by Allied bombing during World War II. Wheatcroft had also supplemented the racing car collection with some additional notable cars, including a replica of the personal Bugatti Royale of Ettore Bugatti. Augmenting the car collections were the world's largest collection of motor racing helmets; Fangio, Graham Hill, Mansell, Hunt and Alonso amongst others, a small collection of racing motorcycles, including a Daijiro Kato Honda and a Barry Sheene Heron Texaco Suzuki and a number of collections of trophies and awards gained by a selection of British drivers and riders. In addition to exhibits, the Donington Grand Prix Collection museum also incorporated a conference suite and gift shop. In 2007, the owner began an attempt to bring Formula 1 back to Donington Park, however the deal collapsed. The Donington Grand Prix Collection was closed briefly in late 2009 in the wake of the death of Tom Wheatcroft and Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd. entering administration under leadership of his son Kevin Wheatcroft. It reopened in January 2010, along with the cafe and race control offices.Matt Beer, Wheatcrofts vow to reopen Donington, Autosport, 10 January 2010. The museum began to sell items to help fund various costs. They sold the Jim Clark Lotus 25 c.2008 to an unknown private collector. Several other Formula 1 cars also disappeared from the museum including Jackie Stewart's 1973 championship winning Tyrrell, Lotus 72 and Ferrari F2000. These cars may have been sold in order to solve Donington's financial problems when it enlarged the circuit and attempted to host the 2012 British Grand Prix. The McLaren Hall Ayrton Senna's MP4/8 from Donington GP '93 . Part of McLaren Hall at Donington Grand Prix Collection David Coulthard's MP4/11 in the McLaren Hall at Donington Grand Prix Collection. The Donington Collection was home to the largest exhibition (being almost comprehensive of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s) of McLaren vehicles. Highlights of the collection included the #1 McLaren M23 driven by Formula 1 World Champion James Hunt in 1977, the McLaren MP4/14 chassis number 4, untouched after crossing the line and affirming Mika H√§kkinen as Formula 1 World Champion, also, the 1993 MP4/8 driven to victory by Ayrton Senna on location at the 1993 European Grand Prix.

At age 12, he was awarded a scholarship to accompany his brother Isidro to Rome so they could further their study of painting. In 1766 he returned to Madrid, where he began to paint for civil and religious institutions as well as private clients. Early career In 1775, Carnicero collaborated with Joseph del Castillo in the execution of tapestry cartoons for the royal household. He also worked as a theatrical decorator for performances at the Teatro de la Cruz and the Teatro del Principe. Between 1780 and 1782, he provided illustrations for a project of the Royal Spanish Academy to prepare a deluxe printing of Don Quixote, edited by Joaqu√≠n Ibarra, that became a milestone edition of the Spanish literary classic. His ability as an artist and painter gained a growing reputation with a colorful series Costumes of Spain and the Indies (1777), portraits of illustrious Spanish personages (1788), and a series of etchings on bullfighting (1790). He scored a major success with his work The Coronation of King Alfonso XI and Queen Mary, His Wife for a competition to decorate the Royal Basilica of San Francisco el Grande. Two other well-known works depict the contemporary sensation of early hot air balloon flights. These paintings might depict one of two events: the first manned flight on 21 November 1783, by Jean-Fran√ßois Pil√¢tre de Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlandes in Paris, or more likely a later demonstration from 5 June 1784, which took place in the gardens of Aranjuez in the presence of the Spanish court. Royal appointment In 1796, Carnicero was named chamber painter for King Charles IV of Spain. This came after several previous failed attempts to secure a court appointment (in 1788, 1792 and 1793). From that point on, he worked mainly as a portraitist of the royal family and leading ministers at court, such as painting a young Manuel Godoy or Pedro Rodr√≠guez de Campomanes. He taught drawing to the children of the royal family, especially the future Ferdinand VII, then Prince of Asturias. On account of his relationship with the Prince, Carnicero drew suspicion of being involved in the El Escorial Conspiracy of 1807 to dethrone Charles IV. As a result, Carnicero was arrested on 7 November and detained for over ten days before being released. As Spain came under Napoleonic rule, beginning in 1809 Carnicero, like Francisco Goya, was required to work for Joseph Bonaparte to maintain his position as court painter. After the restoration of the Bourbons, Carnicero was put on trial for removal from his office on the grounds that he had served the foreign king. An appeal to reinstate him came too late when Carnicero died in Madrid on 21 August 1814, just days before an amnesty was proclaimed by Ferdinand VII.

He was the Chief Justice of the High Court of Mysore State (now Karnataka) and also the first chief of the Central Vigilance Commission of India. He was also chosen as the acting Governor of the Mysore state and was the first person to translate Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography to the Kannada language. Early and personal life Nittoor Srinivasa Rau was born in Bangalore into an educated, middle-class Smartha Brahmin family of Mysore state. His father, Nittoor Shamanna, was a school teacher and the head master of a school in Hosadurga in Chitradurga district. His mother, Seethamma, was the sister of M. N. Krishna Rao, a government official who, many decades later, would serve as acting Diwan of Mysore for a few months in 1941. Rau's family hailed from the village of Nittoor in Gubbi Taluka of Tumkur district (now in Karnataka), and his family was known by the name of their village in the usual south Indian style. Rau's elder sister Puttamma was the mother of C.K.Nagaraja Rao, a noted Kannada litterateur who was nurtured and mentored by Rau. As per Indian tradition, Rau's parents arranged a suitable match for him, and he was married in 1923 at a very young age (he was twenty and his wife was fourteen) to his first cousin Padmamma, daughter of his maternal uncle M. N. Krishna Rao. The marriage, which was entirely harmonious and conventional and lasted all their lives, was blessed with four children, two sons and two daughters. The couple's elder son, N.S. Chandrasekhara, was a Senior Advocate, Litt√©rateur and noted historian of princely Mysore. Their second son, N.S. Subbanna, retired as corporate vice-president of the Kirloskar Electric Company, Bangalore. Rau named his elder daughter Jayaseetha in honour of his beloved mother (Seethamma) and of the then Maharaja of Mysore, Jayachamaraja Wodeyar. She was married, in a match arranged by Rau in the traditional Indian way, to Dr. Visvanatha Premanand, a gentleman of their own community and similar social background. Dr. Premanand, a physicist, took his PhD from the Sorbonne in France and is a professor at the University of Minnesota. Rau's younger daughter, Lalita, worked as a teacher of the visually impaired for many years before she retired to spend time with her grandchildren. She was married to the world renowned physicist Prof. E.C.G.Sudarshan Education Rau did his initial schooling in Kannada medium schools at Hosadurga, Challakere and Shimoga before enrolling in Central College, Bangalore, affiliated at that time to Madras University. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science and joined National High School, Bangalore as a teacher of Science and Mathematics. After a few years, he went back to studies, enrolled in Madras Law College, and took the degree of Bachelor of Law in 1927. Public life Law After completing his degree in law, Nittoor Srinivasa Rau returned to Bangalore and started his career as a lawyer. In 1952, he was chosen as the first chairman of the Mysore state Bar council. He was appointed as the Advocate General of the Mysore state by the Chief Minister, Kengal Hanumanthaiah in 1953. After the formation of the state of Karnataka, he was appointed as the Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court in 1961. When the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, started the Central Vigilance Commission of India in February 1964 to check corruption, he chose Nittoor Srinivasa Rau as the first Central Vigilance Commissioner of India. Freedom Movement When he turned 18, Nittoor Srinivasa Rau joined the Indian National Congress. In the 1930s and 1940s, he participated in the Indian independence movement. He worked for the Mysore state unit of the Congress and actively participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement. In 1932, he also ran the Congress state unit office in Dharwad. During the Quit India Movement of 1942, he provided shelter to Congress leaders such as Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, R. R. Diwakar, and U. S. Mallya. Influence of Gandhi In the early 1920s, he was influenced by the principles of Mahatma Gandhi, and when Gandhi visited Bangalore in 1927, Nittoor Srinivasa Rao took permission from him to translate his autobiography to Kannada. He and his wife assumed the title Ibbaru Kannadigaru and started translating the autobiography, which was then published in the form of a serial in the Kannada newspapers, Vishwa Karnataka and Lokmata. He named the translation as Satyashodhana (In pursuit of truth). To promote the Gandhian principles, he became the president of Karnataka Gandhi Smaaraka Nidhi (Karnataka Gandhi Memorial Trust) and Gandhi Peace Foundation. He also started a khadi unit to promote the use of khadi. Literature Nittoor Srinivasa Rau became a member of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat in 1922. When he realized the need of a publication to publish Kannada books, he started his own publishing house called Satyashodhana Prakatana Mandira (Satyashodhana Publication House) and an associated book store called Satyashodhana Pustaka Mandira. One of the important books published by him was Bala Prapancha, a collection of stories for children written by the renowned Shivaram Karanth. He also published the works of C. K. Venkataramaiya, Kuvempu, Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar and G. P. Rajarathnam. Srinivasa Rau was also influenced by the Kannada writer, D. V. Gundappa and joined his social institute, The Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs. In 1975, he became an honorary secretary of the institute and continued in the post for sometime whereafter he bequeathed the post to eminent journalist, writer and social activist S. R. Ramaswamy. He also worked towards introducing Kannada as a medium of instruction in schools to educate a large population of students who may not know English. Later years Even in his later years, Nittoor Srinivasa Rau continued to take interests in the activities of the Gokhale institute. The Government of Karnataka honoured him by naming one of the prominent roads in Bangalore after his name. In 2002, he was also felicitated by the Government for his contribution in the field of literature and promotion of human values. He joined the Senior Citizen's Club in Bangalore, which was a forum started to look at the welfare of senior citizens. He was also interested in music, and was the President of the Percussive Arts Centre in Bangalore which was an organisation started to promote percussive arts. He passed 100 years in 2003, and died on 12 August 2004, 12 days short of his 101st birthday .

It was created in 1635 following the partition of Anhalt-Bernburg with Frederick, a younger son of Prince Christian I becoming the reigning prince. The death of Frederick's son Prince William Louis in 1709 resulted in the extinction of the ruling family and Anhalt-Harzgerode was reunited with Anhalt-Bernburg. History Harzgerode Castle Prince Christian I ruled in Bernburg since he and his brothers had divided their Anhalt heritage in 1603. He turned to Calvinism and in 1608 founded the Protestant Union with the Lutheran princes, as deputy of Elector Palatine Frederick IV. In the beginning Thirty Years' War, he led the Bohemian army of Frederick's son Frederick V into the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, suffering a disastrous defeat. Temporarily banned and exiled in Sweden, he could not return to Bernburg until 1624. Christian died in 1630; his sons, Frederick and his elder brother Christian II likewise fought in the war. Frederick served in the Swedish infantry until the Lutheran Elector John George of Saxony concluded the Peace of Prague with the Habsburg emperor Ferdinand II in 1635. Back in Anhalt, he and his brother came to terms in December and divided their father's heritage: while Christian II succeeded as Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, Frederick received the westernmost districts (√Ñmter) of Harzgerode, which had just been devastated by a blaze, and G√ºntersberge in the Harz mountain range. Thereby, his lands comprised the Ascanian home territories in the former Saxon Schwabengau with the ruins of Anhalt Castle. In the ongoing war, Prince Frederick served in the armed forces of Landgrave William V of Hesse-Kassel. Finally in 1641, urged by his brother, he returned to Harzgerode and married Johanna Elisabeth (1619‚Äì1647), daughter of Prince John Louis of Nassau-Hadamar the next year. Frederick made significant efforts to alleviate the impacts of the war on his tiny principality and for the reconstruction after the final Peace of Westphalia. When his cousin John Casimir of Anhalt-Dessau died in 1660, he became senior prince of all Anhalt territories. Federick was succeeded by his only son William in 1670. He continued his father's efforts and strove for the development of the Harz silver mining (galena) areas. His two marriages with Countess Elizabeth Albertina of Solms-Laubach (1631‚Äì1693) and Sophia Augusta (1666‚Äì1733), daughter of Prince Henry of Nassau-Dillenburg remained childless. Upon his death in 1709, his Anhalt share was inherited by his cousin Prince Victor Amadeus of Anhalt-Bernburg.

The war was fought between Moquihuix (or Moquihuixtli), the tlatoani (ruler) of Tlatelolco, and Axayacatl, the tlatoani of Tenochtitlan. It was a last-ditch attempt by Moquihuix and his allies to challenge the might of the Tenochca, who had recently cemented their political dominance within the empire. Ultimately the rebellion failed, resulting in the death of Moquihuix who is pictured in the Codex Mendoza tumbling down the Great Temple of Tlatelolca. As a result of the battle, Tlatelolco was subsumed by Tenochtitlan, removed of its privilege and required to pay tribute to Tenochtitlan every eighty days.  Origin  Axayacatl ascended the Mexica throne following the death of his maternal grandfather Motecuhzoma Illhuicamina in 1469. Moctezuma had spent his long reign leading Tenochtitlan to primacy over the Valley of Mexico. As a result, Emily Umberger argues, fellow rulers were \\"predisposed to challenge\\" the new tlatoani in an attempt \\"to restore the importance of their own cities\\". One of these challengers was Moquihuix, Axayacatl's brother-in-law, who was married to his older sister Chalchiuhnenetzin. While we do not know the exact date of his ascendance to the Tlatelolco throne, Moquihuix seemingly spent some time rebuilding the key religious structures in his city prior to the war. Umberger has argued that these new buildings were constructed as \\"close imitations of those in Tenochtitlan, built to irritate and mock the Tenochca\\". According to Dominican friar Diego Dur√°n in his History of the Indies of New Spain, trouble first began to brew between the two provinces in the fifth year of Axayacatl's reign following an attack on the daughters of the lords of Tlatelolco by the sons of Tenochca noblemen in the Tlatelolco marketplace. At the same time, while the Tlatelolcas were digging a canal to allow passageway into the city, a Tlatelolca built canal was ‚Äúfound broken up and filled in\\". Both these acts greatly angered the lords of Tlatelolco. Dur√°n claims that, as a result of these actions, the Tlatelolcas declared themselves independent to Tenochtitlan decrying: \\"O Aztecs, we who live in Tlatelolco, take courage, let us destroy the Tenochcas\\". With the encouragement of a fellow nobleman, Teconal, Moquihuix summoned all young men over the age of twenty to participate in a series of war exercises aimed to prepare the Tlatelolca to be called to arms at any moment.  The Battle in the Sources  There are a variety of different accounts of the Battle of Tlatelolco in the sources.  Diego Dur√°n  Dur√°n gives an expansive account of the war, depicting it to have taken place in two distinct battles. The first was a Tlatelolca attack on Tenochtitlan. The initial plan was to attack Tenochtitlan at night, killing Axayacatl's older confidants first to leave the young tlatoani defenceless. However, this plan quickly got out and was spread to Axayacatl following a heated exchange between women from both sides in the Tlatelolca marketplace. Having also been informed of Moquihuix‚Äôs war games, Axayacatl decided to place guards secretly throughout the city to spy. He too ordered that all men should be made ready for battle. Meanwhile, Moquihuix, who had been spooked by a series of seemingly evil omens, decided to consult the gods, making celebration in their honour. The celebrations turned sour, however, when the Tlatelolcas began to sing a number of war songs, belittling the people of Tenochtitlan. Dur√°n notes that when they wanted to sing \\"the Tenochcas\\" they sang the \\"Tlatelolcas\\". Fearful that such omens would temper the rebellion, Teconal encouraged Moquihuix to attack that night: \\"everything is ready. Whenever you desire we shall go kill those wildcats who are our neighbours\\". Moquihuix thus sent out his spies to Tenochtitlan who found Axayacatl playing ball with his noblemen. This was done intentionally, however, Axayacatl had been prior warned of the plan by his sister, and Moquihuix's wife, Chalchiuhnenetzin. The spies returned to Tlatelolco, informing Moquihuix that the Tenochcas were ignorant to any plan. As a result, the first battle commenced with Moquihuix readying his troops, entrusting Teconal the stratagem for the attack. Half of the men were sent to hide in the city limits of Tenochtitlan in preparation for an ambush. The other half were sent to cover the walls of Tenochtitlan and block any escape routes. At midnight the signal was given and the Tlatelolca warriors emerged, shouting and yelling. However, the Tenochca were prepared and soon managed to surround them. The resultant onslaught was great, with men on both sides massacred. The Tlatelolcas were humiliated by their defeat and requested that they should be able to fight the Tenochca openly on the battlefield. All Tlatelolcan men were readied for battle. Axayacatl called his councillors to decide what to do. They wished to avoid any more bloodshed. It was agreed that they would try and calm Moquihuix and his advisor‚Äôs ire through reason. A messenger, Cueyatzin, was sent to Tlatelolco. Moquihuix responded with repugnance: \\"tell your lord the king that the answer is that he should be prepared because the people of Tlatelolco are determined to avenge the deaths of the other night\\". Upon hearing this message, Tlacael decried Moquihuix's arrogance, calling for Cueyatzin to return to Tlatelolco, \\"taking with him the ointments and insignia that are applied to the dead\\". Cueyatzin did this immediately, presenting Moquihuix with the funerary insignia. Teconal then appeared and swiftly beheaded Cueyatzin whose head was carried back to the boundaries of Tenochtitlan and thrown. Greatly angered by this action, Axayacatl emerged, armed, and led his Tenochca army towards the city's border where the Tlatelolcas waited, ready for war. Here, then, the second battle commenced. The Tenochcas proved deadly, pushing the Tlatelolcas backwards into the marketplace. Seeing that the battle was lost, Moquihuix and Teconal began to ascend the steps of the central temple-pyramid in order to distract the others so that the army could regroup. According to Dur√°n, this distraction consisted of a squadron of naked women \\"slapping their bellies\\" and \\"squirting milk at the soldiers\\". These women were accompanied by a group of young boys, also naked, and wailing. The Tenochcas, dismayed by the crudity, were ordered not to harm the women nor boys but rather take them prisoner - which they did successfully. Cecilia Klein has looked at this account in the context of the way gender was understood within Aztec warfare. Here she contends that these women were fighting using the \\"signs of their gender\\" and links them to the \\"Women of Discord\\". Axayacatl proceeded to climb the Tlatelolco pyramid. When he arrived at the summit he found Moquihuix and Teconal clinging to the alter of Huitzilopochtli. Axayacatl slew both men and dragged their bodies out, casting them down the steps of the temple. When the Tlatelolcas saw their chieftain killed, they fled the marketplace and hid in the canals, among the reeds and rushes. However, they were pursued relentlessly by the Tenochca. The war only ceased when Axayacatl's aged uncle, Cuacuauhtzin, beseeched his nephew to give the orders to end the slaughter. Axayacatl stated that since the Tlatelolco had rebelled against the royal crown, from this point on they would have to pay tribute and that all liberties and exemptions enjoyed by Tlatelolco would henceforth cease. When these conditions had been met, he reasoned, the Tlatelolco would be pardoned.  The Codex Mendoza  The Codex Mendoza's account of the war is considerably briefer. In it Moquihuix is described as \\"a powerful and haughty man' who 'began to pick quarrels and fights\\" with the Tenochca. Following the resultant \\"great battles\\" it is said that Moquihuix, \\"pressed in battle\\", fled and took refuge in a temple. However, upon being rebuked by one of the temple's priests for his cowardice, he flung himself off the high temple and died. Tenochtitlan thus emerged victorious and, from this point on, Tlatelolco paid its tribute and acknowledged its vassalage to Tenochtitlan.  Codex Chimalpahin  The Codex Chimalpahin again tells an alternative version of the battle. Here the onus is placed on Moquihuix's relationship with his wife, Chalchiuhnenetzin. According to the Codex Chimalpahin, Chalchiuhnenetzin, the elder sister of Axayacatl, was \\"despised\\" and maltreated by her husband who preferred the company of his \\"concubines\\". Chalchiuhnenetzin was said to have journeyed to Tenochtitlan to speak to her brother and tell him of her mistreatment, she also informed him of the fact that Moquihuix was \\"talking of making war on the lord of Tenochtitlan\\". According to Chimalpahin, it was as a result of this that the war between the two polities began. Chimalpahin states that the war continued for a year with it only coming to an end upon the death of Moquihuix. It is said that the Tenochca \\"threw [Moquihuix] from the top of an earthen mound along with his hunchbacks and [a] quetzal feather crest, there ending the rulership in Tlatelolco\\".  Legacy  Matthew Restall, along with others, has seen that, despite being subsumed by Tenochtitlan in 1473, Tlatelolco continued to have some semblance of a separate identity following the war, with the people usually referring to themselves as Tlatelolca rather than Mexicana. We see the result of this, Restall argues, in Sahag√∫n's Florentine Codex, which was written in partnership with his former students from the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, through the scapegoating of Moctezuma II whom the Tlatelolca blamed for the Mexica-Tenochca defeat. Inga Clendinnen has seen this amalgamated within the \\"returning god-ruler theory\\", the idea that Moctezuma was \\"paralyzed by terror [...] by the conviction that Cort√©s was Quetzalcoatl\\".

History Nightstalker are Argy (Vocals), Andreas Lagios (Bass), Tolis Motsios (Guitar) and Dinos Roulos (Drums). Formed in 1989 by the lead singer and drummer at the same time, Argy, Nightstalker have become popular in the underground rock scene as pioneers of the 'heavy rock' scene (later named as stoner rock) and have earned a cult following. Having a classic rock and metal background, and influenced by the grunge rock of the early 1990s, the band managed to combine the raw rock 'n roll simplicity with heavy riffs and hazy, psychedelic tunes. After some releases in several compilations (Toxic Babes in a Rock 'n Roll Land, Divin'), the band became well known after the release of the first EP, 'SideFX' (1994), and the first full-length release 'Use' (1996). Followed by the third release, the EP 'The Ritual' (2000), the main characteristic of the first decade was the combination of drums playing and lead singing by Argy, and the productions of the albums by Alex K (The Last Drive). The next full- length album, 'Just a Burn' (2004), was the last album that Argy played the drums, although the band had a drummer (Costas, a.k.a. Digital Alchemist) for the live shows. This album was a big opportunity to grow the bands' fan base, and its success was a big step for their next album 'Superfreak' (2009) which was released by the American label MeteorCity. On September 2012 their sixth album 'Dead Rock Commandos' was released by Small Stone Records. The band itself usually rejects the \\"stoner rock\\" label. They have played live both in Greece and have toured Europe and appeared in various festivals, while supporting bands such as The Last Drive, Deus ex Machina and Uriah Heep etc. In 2016 a tribute album saw the light under the \\"Children Of The Grave\\" name with bands like Tonia, Heritage or Demolition Train playing their tunes.http://getmetal.org/111418-va-children-of-the-grave- a-tribute-to-nightstalker-2016.html Discography * SideFx (1994 Hitch Hyke) * Use (1996 FM Records) * The Ritual (2000 Vinylust) * Just a Burn (2004 Mad Prophet Records) * Superfreak (2009 Meteor City) * Dead Rock Commandos (2012 Small Stone Records) * As Above, So Below (2016 Oak Island Records) * Great Hallucinations (2019) References External links Official Facebook Page Category:Stoner rock musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1989 ","title":"Nightstalker (band)"},{"id":"13077032","text":"Pholiderpeton is an extinct genus of amphibian which lived in the Late Carboniferous period (Bashkirian) of Europe.

Known primarily for his crime noir paperback cover art, he has produced artwork for over 1,200 covers since 1950. Maguire is a Member Emeritus of The Society of Illustrators. Life Son of a draftsman architect, Robert Maguire began his education at Duke University, but like so many others of his generation, left for service in World War II, fighting with the 88th infantry in Italy. Upon his return, his interest in art led him to the Art Students League in New York, where his instructor was the famed Frank Reilly. Two of Maguire's more noteworthy fellows were Clark Hulings and James Bama, graduates all of the class of '49. Maguire's career took off immediately with his first work for Trojan Publications: cover art for their line of small pocket pulps, with titles like Hollywood Detective Magazine (Oct. 1950). Maguire did three of the eight covers for this pocket pulp series. From then on, his career blossomed. His classic period of the 50s and 60s grew out of his skilled female images, some of the best and most memorable of the period. Maguire's mastery of the \\"femme fatale\\" created a vintage paperback icon: his women are passionate yet somehow down to earth, approachable, though sometimes at your own risk. Robert Maguire continued evolving and producing fine art as well as many memorable illustrations. Artwork Maguire's over 1,200 covers for such publishers as Pocket, Dell, Ace, Harper, Avon, Silhouette, Ballantine, Pyramid, Bantam, Lion, Berkley, Beacon, Monarch and Signet - virtually every mainstream publishing house in New York - makes his original cover art a tour de force in the last half of the twentieth century. One of his most famous book covers is Black Opium, which is considered by many crime noir paperback collectors to be the definitive crime noir paperback cover of the genre. He also designed art covers for video games and for music CDs.  See also  *Illustration *List of illustrators  References   Further reading  * External links *Robert A. Maguire *Robert A.

It seems likely he remained several years working as an officer in Carducci's workshop, because until 1633 there is no documentation of his work as an independent painter. In 1627 he was called for the second time as Painter to the King position, left vacant now after Bartolom√© Gonz√°lez y Serrano's death. Castello painted for the chapel of Santo Cristo de la Paciencia in the Convent of the Capuchins. He also painted for the cloister of the Convent of Santa Barbara. He is also said to have contributed along with Alonzo Cano and others to the portraits of kings for the Royal Palace of Madrid. He also worked on the Lactation of the Virgin to St. Bernard, in the church of San Juan in Telde ( Gran Canaria ), and some works attributed by stylistic similarity, among which the Saint Francis of Assisi at the Prado Museum. Later life The next documented event in his life comes November 1647, when he is widowed, and then remarried soon after to Barbara Huete (February 1648). He died in Madrid on September 12, 1651.

She sank off the Mediterranean coast of Israel in 2007 after the cruise ship rammed her and broke her in two. Two of Shellys crew were killed. Ship The Ivan Dimitrov shipyard on the River Danube in Ruse, Bulgaria built the ship and launched her in 1973 as Zlatograd. She changed hands in 1999 and was renamed Loti. She changed hands again in 2002 and was renamed Dora. In 2003 Israeli owners bought her, renamed her Shelly and registered her in Slovakia. She was crewed not by Israelis but by other nationalities, mainly Slovaks and Ukrainians. Collision and sinking On 30 August 2007, Shelly was at anchor about off Israeli coast, near the port of Haifa, when at about 10pm she was accidentally rammed by the Cypriot passenger ship Salamis Glory, which had left port at Haifa several minutes before. Shelly sank quickly after the collision, which the Israel Broadcasting Authority said broke her in half. 11 crew members escaped, and most climbed aboard a rescue launch lowered by Salamis Glory and were subsequently rescued by the Israeli Navy. The rest were rescued by helicopter. The survivors refused to be taken to a local hospital for treatment. Salamis Glory subsequently returned to port in Haifa, showing slight damage to her hull. None of Salamis Glorys 700 or so passengers and crew was injured. The remaining two crew members were declared missing, prompting a search and rescue operation involving six naval vessels, multiple aircraft and divers. 12 hours after the sinking their bodies were recovered from the wreck by divers in of water. The dead were identified as the ship's Indonesian First Mate and Ukrainian engineer. The vessel's sinking released an oil spill that moved down the coast, causing authorities to warn the public not to bathe at the nearby Zevulun beach. On 31 August Salamis Lines, owners of Salamis Glory, arranged for 148 stranded Cypriot passengers from the ship to be flown back to Cyprus on a Cyprus Airways jet. Investigation Israeli Police launched a full investigation into the cause of the accident, aided by Cypriot authorities. All of Salamis Glorys crew were interviewed. One possibility being considered was that there was a fault in the ship's navigation system, with some reports of a loss of steering control aboard Salamis Glory.

Up till 1794 he was involved in a total of eleven loans that were granted in Amsterdam to the United States with a value of 29 million guilders, and in the Holland Land Company. Life In 1782, the brothers led discussions with John Adams over a loan to the United States of five million guilder, at that time a considerable sum. A syndicate was formed to organize the USA's first foreign loan between the Staphorsten, the Willinks and De la Lande & Fijnje. Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol was marked down for 12.000 guilders. Three others loans followed: in 1784, 1787 and 1788. (In 1786 the merchant Daniel Parker took over the shares of De la Lande & Fijnje). Simon Schama noted: \\"Part of the attraction of this stock was, doubtless, the possibility of buying cheap and selling at a quick profit to investors less well informed than the brokers as to the state of American credit.\\" In September 1787 Nicolaas van Staphorst did not flee to northern France like his brother Jacobus, a prominent leader of the Dutch patriots and of the Revolutionary Committee of the Batavian Republic. In the beginning of 1788 Nicolaas proclaimed that \\"experts\\" must draw up a new constitution for the moment at which the patriotic revolutions would take place. After the American example, he advised that the seven regions of the Netherlands and the Generality Lands be forced to give up their sovereignty and administrations, to be replaced by a whole new constitution in which the people's influence on the election of the regents would be hugely increased. The Van Staphorst brothers, along with Wilhelm Willink and Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck, were in 1789 shareholders in the Holland Land Company, a society that invested in the north of the state of New York, not far from Ontario, Pennsylvania and some canals: the Patowmack Canal, James River and Kanawha Canal and Santee Canal. He supported Gerrit Boon, his brother-in-law, winning maple syrup from the ahorn. Nicolaas and the secret political societies which were formed were of the opinion that this issue had to be resolved at all costs, and that Johan Valckenaer and his friends were the most appropriate people to draw up a Dutch-language constitution. The leading Dutch patriots, like Wiselius, Krayenhoff, and Nicolaas van Staphorst requested general Charles-Fran√ßois Dumouriez to plant the liberty tree in The Hague or on the Dam square and to bring about liberty, equality and fraternity by force. They also spoke about a new calendar, to make every month of an equal length. At the end of November 1794 he and Alexander Gogel fled to Bremen or Hamburg, because of the discovery of a weapons cache. He was banned from city of Amsterdam. Two months later the French Army had occupied the whole of Holland. External links * http://www.parlement.com/9291000/biof/08852 * http://history.rays-place.com/ny/alma-ny.htm Literature * Veru, P.T.

He was a prominent figure in the early days of the community, who served his country as a doctor and soldier. Johannes Palm was born in Heilsbronn to Matthias and Sibylla Palm on July 15, 1713. In 1739, Palm moved to Backnang, near Stuttgart. He married Christina Dorothea Kern on August 2, 1740. After a visit to Amsterdam, Palm began to study medicine in W√ºrttemberg. He was most likely aided by relatives, as many physicians and druggists in W√ºrttemberg at that time held the Palm family name. Palm left Germany, and arrived in Philadelphia in 1749. He first settled in Northern New Jersey, near Elizabeth. After the death of his wife, he married Catharine Salome Fenger around 1754. He would outlive her as well. On June 17, 1766, Palm secured his plot from Conrad Raisch. Palm was the third owner of the tract since it was surveyed for Johannes Deininger in 1751. This tract can be located today using Railroad St. as the eastern border, Maple St. as the southern border, and the Dauphin County Line as the western border. His house would be in the center of the 100 block on W. Main St. By the time the American Revolution broke out in 1775, Palm was 62. Although he felt was too old to take an active part in the revolution, he did participate in the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777. He would later recall how George Washington would encourage his men in battle. Sixteen days after he served at Brandywine, Palm took the Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity before Justice of the Peace John Thomas. Ten other soldiers from the Palmyra area also served in the American Revolution. Their names are recorded and their graves are marked in Bindnagles Cemetery. Palm had an extensive medical practice. Since the region was still sparsely populated, many of his patients traveled great distances to receive his attention. He had a sophisticated laboratory where he prepared most of his medicines. He distilled his own essential oils and waters from herbs, flowers and other plants. His medical books were mostly from German authors. Palm was baptized and confirmed into the Lutheran Church. Johannes Palm died on April 25, 1799, in Palmyra, at the age of 85. He had practiced medicine in North America for nearly 50 years. On July 24, 1932, American Legion Post No. 72, with the assistance of S. M. Aument of Montoursville, a great-great-great-great granddaughter of Johannes Palm, unveiled a new marker at Palm‚Äôs grave at Bindnagle Cemetery, located at Bindnagle Lutheran Church, 801 Gravel Hill Road. On November 20 of that same year, the John Palm Memorial was erected on a small triangle of land on Railroad St. On hand was Dr. Howard Palm of Camden, who was also a direct descendant of Johannes Palm.

Isaac Post Isaac and Amy Post, were radical Hicksite Quakers from Rochester, New York, involved in the struggles for abolitionism and women's rights. Among the first believers in Spiritualism, they helped to associate the young religious movement with the political ideas of the mid- nineteenth-century reform movement. Early life Amy Post was born Amy Kirby on December 20, 1802, in Jericho, New York, to Joseph Kirby and Mary (Seaman) Kirby, members of the Society of Friends, also known as Quakers. The importance of humanitarian reform was embedded in Amy's early education and was the foundation for her later work as both an abolitionist and women's-rights activist. Isaac Post was born February 26, 1798, of Long Island, New York, Quaker families. Around 1821, Isaac Post married Amy's elder sister, Hannah Kirby. In 1823 they moved to Cayuga County, New York, where he established a farm. In 1827 Hannah fell ill, and Amy joined the Posts to help care for her sister's two children. Hannah soon died, and Amy stayed on with Isaac to continue caring for the children. In 1828 Amy Kirby married Isaac Post, with whom she had four children: Jacob, Joseph, Matilda, and Willet. That same year, radical Quakers split from the denomination, and Isaac Post and Amy Kirby joined the more radical wing, headed by Elias Hicks., , Braude 2001 After Isaac and Amy married, they moved to Rochester in 1836, where they lived on North Plymouth Avenue. In 1839, Isaac went into business as a druggist, in the Smith Arcade on Exchange Street. Abolitionists The couple quickly became involved in radical causes. Amy Post became an active and visible member of the Genesee Yearly Meeting of Hicksite Friends (GYM). Post, alongside her husband Isaac, dedicated much of her time to a very progressive group of Quakers who sought to give both men and women the same rights during the meetings of the Society of Friends. In 1837, Amy Post went against the desires of the Society of Friends elders, who disapproved of slavery but distrusted radical abolitionism, and signed her first \\"worldly\\" petition against slavery. In 1842, Amy and Isaac Post became two of the founders of the Western New York Anti-Slavery Society (WNYASS). WNYASS was not an abolitionist group only for Quakers. Among its members were evangelical Protestants and deists as well. As an officer of the society, it was Amy Post's duty to organize fundraising fairs and group conventions. Despite the fact that the Society of Friends was a firmly anti-slavery group, the elders of the Rochester Monthly Meeting (RMM) accused Post of being too worldly in her efforts of trying to abolish slavery. Post disregarded the RMM's investigations of her \\"worldly\\" efforts and continued to be a Quaker abolitionist. She even continued distributing religious testimonies on the American Anti-Slavery Society's official letterhead. For the Posts there should be no boundary between the religious beliefs of a Quaker and political activism of an abolitionist. By the early 1840s, radical Quakers began to hold abolitionist meetings in the Post home, where prominent reform lecturers such as William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony, and Sojourner Truth visited and spoke. Douglass became a close personal friend of the Posts who helped establish him in Rochester where he published his newspaper the \\"North Star\\". Douglass and the Posts also collaborated in ferrying fugitive slaves and their home served as a station on the Underground Railroad, holding as many as 20 escaped slaves at a time. > One Saturday night, after all our household were asleep, there came a tiny > tap at the door, and the door was opened to fifteen tired and hungry men and > women who were escaping from the land of slavery. They seemed to know that > Canada, their home of rest, was near, and they were impatient, but the > opportunity to cross the lake compelled their waiting until Monday early in > the morning. That being settled, and their hunger satisfied, together with a > comfortable and refreshing sleep, they became so elated with their nearness > to perfect and lasting freedom that they were forgetful of any danger either > to us, or to themselves, so that they were obliged to be constantly watched > through the day to keep them from popping their heads out of the windows and > otherwise showing themselves. ...

They had no ministers or elders as all people were considered equal within the YMCF. The members of YMCF would do whatever they considered necessary to end slavery, and therefore put no limit on \\"worldly\\" efforts to abolish slavery. Finally, the YMCF had no tolerance for racial or sexual discrimination. They believed that all people should be considered equal morally, religiously, and politically. The motto of the Congregational Friends was \\"common natures, common rights, and a common destiny.\\" Women's rights In 1848, Amy Post began to be involved as an organizer in the women's movement. Acting upon her beliefs in equality for women, she attended the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 in Seneca Falls, NY. She and Mary Post, her stepdaughter, were among the one hundred women and men who signed the Declaration of Sentiments, which was first presented there. Two weeks later, she and several other women who had participated in the Seneca Falls Convention organized the Rochester Women's Rights Convention in the Post's hometown of Rochester, New York. A planning meeting chose Amy Post as temporary chair and designated a nominating committee to propose a slate of officers. The Seneca Falls Convention had followed tradition by electing a man as president of the convention. Defying tradition, the Rochester organizers proposed a woman, Abigail Bush, for that position. When the convention assembled in the Rochester Unitarian Church on August 2, Amy Post called it to order and read the suggested slate of officers. The proposal for a woman to be president of the convention was strongly opposed by some of the leaders of the women's movement who were present, fearing that women were not yet ready to take that step. Bush was elected despite the opposition, making this the first public meeting of both men and women in the U. S. whose presiding officer was a woman. Amy Post continued to attend women's rights conventions, and at a convention in Rochester in 1853, she signed \\"The Just and Equal Rights of Women\\" resolution. Accompanied by Lucy Coleman, Post visited fugitive slave colonies in Canada, and attended conventions all through the North. Post became good friends with Harriet Jacobs, who she encouraged to write Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (published in 1861 under the name \\"Linda Brent\\"). Amy served the community in practical and tangible ways, such as collecting food, medical supplies, and clothing for freed slaves during the Civil War. After the War, Post became a member of both the Equal Rights Association and the National Woman Suffrage Association. In 1872, Amy Kirby Post successfully registered herself to vote, but unlike Susan B. Anthony, she was turned away at the polls and unable to cast her vote. Undaunted, Post continued her women's equality work throughout her life, and in 1885 became one of the founding members of the Women's Political Club. In 1888, Post traveled to Washington D.C. to attend the International Council of Women, the largest women's convention at that time. Spiritualism In 1848, the Posts took into their home the Fox sisters, Kate and Margaret, who appeared to have acquired the ability to communicate with spirits through rapping noises. They introduced the girls to their circle of radical friends, and almost all became ardent believers in the emerging religion of Spiritualism. Isaac Post himself became an acknowledged medium. His 1852 book, Voices From the Spirit World, Being Communications From Many Spirits, was presented as the spirit writings of eminent persons such as Benjamin Franklin and George Fox. Family Isaac's brother, Joseph (30 November 1803 Westbury, New York - 17 January 1888), was also an abolitionist and had early differences with the Quakers, although they finally came around to his point of view. He encouraged Isaac T. Hopper, Charles Marriot, and James S. Gibbons when they were disowned by the Society of Friends on account of their outspoken opposition to slavery. Joseph spent his whole life in the house where he was born. Legacy Historic Marker at the former site of the Post House in Rochester, NY Isaac Post died in April 1872. Amy Post died January 29, 1889.

It was the erstwhile residence of T. S. Eliot. History The location of today‚Äôs Kensington Court Place was formerly part of the Vallotton estate, dating back to the late 18th century. Kensington Court Place was originally known as Charles Street and renamed in 1908. The eastern side of Charles Street was the former site of open grounds, known as The Paddock. It was the home of the Kensington Lawn Tennis Club prior to being bought by local surveyor, Albert James Barker for building development in 1886. Kensington Court Gardens from corner of Thackeray St and Kensington Court Place The mansion block, Kensington Court Gardens is believed to be designed by Henry W. Peck and built by Frederick Moir of Moir, Wallis and Company in 1887-9 in association with Albert Barker. Albert Barker was responsible for a large amount of the building development around Thackeray Street, Ansdell Street and Kensington Court Place and was responsible for much of the street layout that we see today. The Times first advertised flats for Kensington Court Gardens in January 1889 at between ¬£195 and ¬£250 per annum. Kensington Court Gardens first appears in the London Directory in 1889, listed with Moir Wallis & Co. Builders, with building works not completed. The first residents appear in the 1890 Directory, with flat No.1 again, with Moir Wallis & Co. During the 1890s, a number of residents were retired military men. The 1891 census shows residents General Alexander Silver, Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Knight and Major-General James Black. The 1901 census and Royal Blue Book show other notable residents, including the builder Frederick Moir at No.7 and publisher Herbert Doubleday at No.9. Doubleday was responsible for the publishing of the Victoria History of the Counties of England and The Complete Peerage. Flat No.1 Kensington Court Gardens was originally the home of the building caretaker, listed in the 1891 census as Mr Charles Hall with his wife Emily. The 1901 census shows No.1 as the home of James E. Raybould, Hall Porter, with his wife Elizabeth. Other notable residents include the Kopman family, who amassed their fortune from property development and investment banking. T. S. Eliot T. S. Eliot blue plaque, 3 Kensington Court Gardens It is most famously the residence of poet, critic and playwright, T. S. Eliot who moved to No.3 Kensington Court Gardens in 1957, after his secret marriage to his secretary from Faber and Faber, (Esm√©) Valerie Eliot on 10 January 1957. The marriage was criticised not only because it was kept a secret from all but her parents, but at the time Eliot was 68 and Valerie only 30 years old. Despite the criticism and the age difference, it appears to have been the happiest time of Eliot‚Äôs life, the Oxford Dictionary of Biography stating he \\"attained a degree of contentedness that had eluded him all his life\\". However, at the time Eliot‚Äôs health was already in decline and he died in the flat only eight years later, on 4 January 1965. His widow lived at the flat until her death in 2012. She was editor and custodian of his correspondence, only recently published (in three volumes, 1996, 2009, and 2012).

He notably played as a professional for Sheffield Wednesday and Grimsby Town where he spent numerous seasons playing in the second and third tier of English football. He left Grimsby in 2006 and dropped into playing Non-league football with Worksop Town and later Boston United before quitting football in 2008 due to personal reasons one of which being his weight. He briefly returned to play for Hallam in 2009, but left after a couple of months. He now resides back in Sheffield and plays amateur football in the town's Saturday and Sunday leagues.http://www.thefishy.co.uk/story.php?id=8502271 Playing career Sheffield Wednesday Crane started his career with Sheffield Wednesday in 1999, and was promoted from the club's youth academy into the squad that summer. The 1999‚Äì2000 campaign would spell the end of Wednesday's stay in the Premier League, as well as this, Crane failed to make an appearance in England's top division for The Owls. In the next couple of seasons, Crane established himself as a first team player, and played apart in the club's next three seasons, which were all contested playing in the English First Division. Crane would be used in three positions for the Wednesday. His original position of playing as a defensive central midfield, was often mixed with using him as a centre back, and in some circumstances his height and frame were used as an advantage when his manager picked him as a makeshift centre forward. In the 2002‚Äì2003 season, Sheffield Wednesday were relegated from the First Division, along with Brighton & Hove Albion and local rivals Grimsby Town. Following the club's further demise down the English domestic football ladder, Crane decided to leave Hillsborough at the end of the season, and moved to sign for Grimsby on a free transfer, he would become the first new signing for manager Paul Groves for the 2003‚Äì04 season. after both clubs had been relegated in the previous season. Grimsby Town After playing the majority of his football in midfield and attack with Wednesday, Tony found himself installed as one of Grimsby's first choice centre backs although though he was initially unveiled as a midfielder when he signed for the club. He featured alongside Mike Edwards, Simon Ford or Player-Manager Paul Groves in the heart of the Grimsby defence during his first season with The Mariners. His career at Grimsby was dogged with controversy, despite being a fans favourate, his disciplinary record wasn't the greatest, clocking up 15 yellow cards and two red cards in his debut season. By the end of the 2003‚Äì2004 season Crane had suffered a third career relegation as Grimsby slumped into the drop zone on the last day of the season which saw them relegated for the second successive season. During the 2004‚Äì2005 season, Crane was plagued with an injury that keep him out on the sidelines for up to 8 months. He eventually returned very late on in the season, making 3 appearances in total. Crane would not manage to reclaim his position at the back until the following season. Following some encouraging performances in the club's pre-season friendlies, Crane had cemented himself back in the team, partnering Rob Jones as the club's preferred centre backs, thus seeing club captain Justin Whittle relegated to the bench. Crane managed to score a goal on the first day of the 2005‚Äì2006 season against Oxford United, this would be his last goal for Grimsby, after scoring three times before hand. A slight aggravation in his old injury would eventually see Tony lose his place to Whittle in the team in September 2005, and after several months on the sidelines he had appeared to gain weight rapidly and became alarmingly unfit by the standards of a professional footballer. Crane returned from injury but found his chances of first team football to be non-existent, despite the sale of Simon Ramsden too Rochdale, Crane was constantly overlooked in the first team with manager Russell Slade preferring to name reserve Glen Downey as the defensive option on the bench. Crane was made available for loan in October with Russell Slade slamming him for his poor fitness and also his lack of enthusiasm to shed weight and in November 2005 fellow League Two side Wrexham made an approach to sign him, but this bid was rejected on the basis that Crane didn't fancy a move to Wales. Also interested were Conference North outfit Worksop Town, and shortly afterwards Crane joined the Nottinghamshire club on an initial three- month loan. Worksop Town Worksop had also signed Darren Mansaram on loan, a former Grimsby teammate of Crane's. With many people expecting Crane to return to Grimsby and fight for his place, he did not and he moved to Worksop on a permanent deal in January 2006 on a free transfer. Tony played out the remainder of the 2005‚Äì2006 season for the club, but soon attracted more attention from another Welsh club, with The Tigers turning down a bid for Crane from Newport County in December 2006. In May 2007, Worksop were relegated from the Conference North division; this would be Tony's third career relegation, and also meaning he had suffered relegation with every club he had played for. With finances that bad at Worksop, they had had to leave their home stadium, some of the more expensive playing staff were released to reduce costs. Crane would be one of the players who would see his Worksop career end in this fashion. Boston United In June 2007 he joined former Football League side Boston United on trial, along with fellow former Grimsby players Jonathan Rowan, Matthew Bloomer and Adam Buckley. A month later Crane made the move to Boston a permanent one. Tony slotted in at centre back for the club, and his never say die attitude, that made him popular at Grimsby, saw him become increasingly popular with United fans. His aerial presence had seen him score several headed goals, and Boston boss Tommy Taylor was able to mould his first team defence around Crane. Despite his performances he became increasingly over weight, even more so than when the problem occurred at Grimsby, and once again he became under fire again by his own club manager. Taylor stated that Tony would find it a huge possibility to return to the professional game. but only if he was able to knuckle down and lose the required weight he had gained. Taylor, also commented that his weight was the reason that Crane received at least a yellow card in nearly every game he played in, mentioning that he was slow on challenging and his big frame would often be used against him when in a tussle with an opponent. Crane continued to play week in week out for The Pilgrims, but continued to struggle to budge any weight, and carried on to put on more bulk as the season ran along.HighBeam Following the close of the 2007‚Äì2008 season, Crane and Boston parted company. He would remain without a club for the entire 2008‚Äì2009 season and had turned down an offer to join up with Ilkeston Town to concentrate on his new-found fatherhood. In December following the sacking of Tommy Taylor, Boston's new manager Steve Welsh confirmed the club would like to resign Crane, if he was in a fit enough state to play.http://www.sportsecho.co.uk/football/boston_united/news/displayarticle.php?ID=5871 Crane was present in the club's league game at Frickley Athletic and commented a return to United could be on the cards.http://www.bostonstandard.co.uk/boston-united-news/United-reach-for- Crane-lift.4827927.jp However a deal was never struck and Crane would play no part in the entire season. Hallam On 23 October 2009, exactly 17 months after leaving Boston, Crane returned to the sport, signing with lowly non league side Hallam F.C., who play in the Northern Counties East Football League Premier Division.http://www.thestar.co.uk/football/Struggling-Hallam- look-for-Crane.5760510.jp By Christmas, Crane had departed. Personal life During Crane's time at Grimsby Town he was ousted from the first team by his manager Russell Slade for his rapidly increasing weight problems. Despite being recognised as a talasmanic figurehead amongst the club's crop of players at the time his weight instantly led to his departure from professional football when he left Grimsby to join Worksop Town in 2006. Whilst with Boston United during the 2007‚Äì2008 season, writer Duncan Browne wrote \\"Despite having arguably the finest touch in the Blue Square North, he certainly had the largest frame (the club's XL shirt and shorts fitting him as if he was a cyclist),\\". \\"Despite becoming an instant fans' favourite, he got into several scrapes with manager Tommy Taylor, failing to show up for training and even getting busted for playing in goal for a Sheffield Sunday League side while under contract. \\"Taylor once joked: 'It would help if Craney stopped turning up for training with a Big Mac' ‚Äì ‚Äì eventually dropping him for the final seven games of the season due to his inability to shed the weight. And with that, the player's contract expired and he decided to quit football.\\" Despite his short stay with Hallam in 2009, Crane has since retired from the sport at the age of 27. During the 2011/12 season Crane has made a football comeback signing for Amateur Sheffield Meadowhall League Division 2 side Hackenthorpe FC. During the 2012/13 season he was registered for Sheffield amateur side Beighton Albion.http://www.clubwebsite.co.uk/beightonalbion/143622/Players/view/2037955 Tony now plays for Sheffield imperial league side, FDL Totley.

Together, housed in one location, the partners have separate governing bodies and finances, but collocate resources. The partners' collections make up the biggest repository of Jewish history in the United States. The Center for Jewish History serves as a centralized place of scholarly research, events, exhibitions, and performances. Located within the Center are the Lillian Goldman Reading Room, Ackman & Ziff Family Genealogy Institute and a Collection Management & Conservation Wing. The Center for Jewish History is also an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution.  History  The Center for Jewish History on 16th Street In 2000, the Center was opened after six years of construction and planning with a goal of creating synergy among the five member organizations, each offering a different approach to Jewish history, scholarship and art. This was one of the first attempts at uniting differing views on Jewish culture and resulted in the largest repository documenting the Jewish experience outside of Israel leading some to refer to it as the Jewish Library of Congress. In the late 1980s, Bruce Slovin, who was the chairman of YIVO, originated the concept of unified center where the partners could share resources. The idea was triggered when he realized that the then home of YIVO, a mansion located at 86th and Fifth Avenue, was not able to meet the needs of its collections or visitors, resulting in an environment that was hazardous to the collection (it was not temperature-controlled) as well as made archival study difficult. The location on Museum Mile was not seen as an advantageous adjacency. Slovin saw YIVO and the partner organizations as being more academic-focused. The Leo Baeck Institute was previously located at 129 East 73rd Street, and the American Jewish Historical Society, which had previously been a New York City-based institution prior to the early 1960s, was then located near Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. The Yeshiva University Museum was located in the Washington Heights neighborhood uptown. When it opened its doors to the public in October 2000, the Center struggled with financial problems. In 2007, there were preliminary talks about a partnership with NYU's Skirball Department for Hebrew and Judaic Studies to the benefit of both organizations. In the end, the Center and Skirball decided not to move forward. In 2010, the Center for Jewish History was able to raise $30 million to retire its construction debt. The amount was raised and donated by the chairman and founder of the center, Bruce Slovin; co-chairmen William Ackman and Joseph Steinberg; the Fairholme Foundation; and 19 other donors. These efforts meant that the Center was debt-free. In 2012, the Center received a top rating of four stars from the Charity Navigator non-profit evaluation service. In 2013, the Lillian Goldman Charitable Trust awarded the Center a $1.5 million grant to establish a reference services division.  Facilities  The Center is located in Manhattan's Union Square neighborhood, and is a four-building campus built around a courtyard that has a central entrance on 16th Street. The Center is made up of four previously existing buildings and two new buildings. The buildings are the former location of the American Foundation for the Blind/Helen Keller Institute. The cost of the complex was $4.4 million.  Collections  The partners' collections include more than 100 million documents, 500,000 books, thousands of art objects, textiles, ritual objects, music, films, and photographs. most of which had been poorly housed in the member institutions and were at risk of damage or destruction. The Center is heavily involved with the preservation of records that define moments in Jewish immigration to New York City. A $670,000 grant awarded in 2007 helped with the cataloging of these materials.  Partner collection highlights  * Original handwritten copy of Emma Lazarus' 1883 \\"Give me your tired, your poor\\" poem that was later inscribed on the base of the Statue of Liberty * Sandy Koufax's Brooklyn Dodgers jersey * Letter from Thomas Jefferson to New York's oldest Jewish congregation * First Hebrew prayer books printed in America The collections range from the early modern era in Europe and pre-colonial times in the Americas to present-day materials from across the globe. The Center provides access to a comprehensive collection of historic archival materials, including Franz Kafka, Theodor Herzl, Moses Mendelssohn, Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein. In addition to historical documents like the 1478 record of the trial of Simon of Trent, the Center also includes holdings of artwork by Max Lieberman as well as Jewish ephemera like philosopher Moses Mendelssohn's eyeglasses.  Digital initiatives  * In 2011, the Center for Jewish History began a 2-year project called, \\"Illuminating Hidden Collections at the Center for Jewish History,\\" with a $229,600 grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources * In 2013, the Center for Jewish History donated 600 images to the Google Art Project, which is part of the Google Cultural Institute, an initiative that puts cultural material online. The Center was one of four New York City-based institutions to donate at that time, joining eight others. The images are very high resolution and include rich metadata.

In length a few feet short of the length of the RMS Titanic, it was conceived by Robert Matthew Johnson Marshall, and there are some prominent nods to naval architecture in the design. Its construction began in 1993, and it was officially opened by the Queen on Monday 1 July 1996. Civil servants began moving offices there in phases from autumn 1995. View of Victoria Quay showing the mass and length of the building View of Commercial Quay, adjoining Victoria Quay The building was set on redeveloped dockland and housed parts of what was then known as the Scottish Office. With the advent of parliamentary devolution in 1999, these offices became part of the then Scottish Executive, now the Scottish Government. 2,200 civil servants work at Victoria Quay, making it the Scottish Government's largest building in terms of size and occupation. This building launched Leith's regeneration programme proper. New luxury flats, converted bond warehouses, bistros, bars, and restaurants followed. This regeneration is continuing today, with high-rise construction work on reclaimed dockland just a few hundred metres behind Ocean Terminal, a signature shopping centre which opened in 2001, encouraged by demand from the 2,000 civil servants working at Victoria Quay, as well as from local people. Until Victoria Quay opened, most of these official posts were at New St. Andrew's House (NSAH) on James Craig Walk, Jeffrey Street and Brandon Street in central Edinburgh. New St. Andrew's House (NSAH) was closed in phases from 1995 to 1996 as a result of the presence of asbestos in the building, and lay empty until demolition in 2017.

Nice had been initially released in the US with a slightly longer version of Rondo 69 not available on the UK or on the independently- distributed US versions. The first US version of Nice was briefly reissued in 1973 by Columbia Special Products. Continuing the Nice's fusion of jazz, blues, and rock, this album consists of studio (1‚Äì4) and live (5‚Äì6) tracks, the latter having become firm favourites in the band's live performances. The album reached number 3 in the UK Album charts.  Notes  The UK version of the album came in a gatefold sleeve, showing photographs of the band relaxing at an unknown location, the interior of which featured handwritten notes by Keith Emerson. > Azrael was the first thing I wrote with Lee ‚Äì now revisited it relates to > the Angel of Death.

It is part of the Verbandsgemeinde Annweiler am Trifels. History Middle Ages The village was first mentioned in 1065. Samuel, abbot of the Weissenburg Monastery in Alsace endowed the altars of the Redeemer and the Mother of God; one was in Adelbresddeswilare of Albratheswilre. In 985, Duke Otto I took possession of Albersweiler and 67 other locations from the Weissenburgers, as a part of the \\"Salian Church Robbery.\\" By 1219, the hamlet was controlled by Annweiler. by 1274, the town of Landau had taken control, and was using Albersweiler as a quarry. By the fifteenth century, Albersweiler had been divided between two different lords, and the main street of the village formed a state border: the southern section became a part of the Duchy of Pfalz- Zweibr√ºcken, and the northern part belonged to Geschlecht von Scharfenberg. Early Modern During the Reformation, the boundary also became denominational: the northern part of Albersweiler was Roman Catholic, and the southern part Protestant. During the Thirty Years War, Catholic troops burned down the Protestant south in 1622. Twelve years later, Protestant Swedes destroyed the northern part of the town, controlled by a Catholic branch of the L√∂wenstein-Scharfeneck family. After the Peace of Westphalia, the town was plagued by the plague. The village began to grow again after the War of Spanish Succession. In 1736, the foundation was laid for the Lutheran Church Building. After the French Revolution in 1794, the French occupied Albersweiler, placing it in the Zweibr√ºcken Arrondissement in the department of Donnersbergkreis (Mount Thunder). After the Congress of Vienna, the Palatinate was transferred from France to Bavaria; Albersweiler belonged to the Canton Annweiler in Bezirksamt Bergzabern until the end of 1946. Since the Nineteenth Century During the Nineteenth century, Albersweiler was a farming village, with most residents involved in wine production. In 1832, the people of the hamlet built a Catholic school and began to build a Protestant school. The Catholic parish of St. Stephen was built starting in 1843. The Lutheran church was built in 1846. Both buildings were designed by the famous Bavarian architect August von Voit. The Jewish community built a synagogue in 1865, which was destroyed in 1938. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the granite quarry on the western edge of Albersweier grew as an industrial location, with a porcelain factory, a glove factory, a shoe factory, a \\"sulfur kitchen\\" (schwefelk√ºche) and a match factory. In 1925, the installation of the local power grid was completed. During the Second World War, the stationing of weapons in a tunnel resulted in repeated bombings by allied aircraft. In the postwar years, the damage was repaired. In 1954-1955, the community built a canal, and new areas were opened for residential building. In 1984, a new bypass was opened to relieve the city of the burden of heavy through-traffic. In 1972, Albersweiler became a part of the local municipality of Annweiler on Trifels. Since 1969, it has belonged to the Landkreis (district) of Landau-Bad Bergzabern, which was renamed in 1978 to S√ºdliche Weinstrasse.

While King Pedro II (ruled 1622‚Äì24) and his son Garcia I (ruled 1624‚Äì1626) were the only other member of the faction or kanda to rule, it retained powerful members in provincial offices in the 1650s until its destruction in the 1670s. Despite this loss in prominence, they were remembered in tradition and are evoked in a proverb, still current in the 1920s Nkutama a mvila za makanda \\"Kinlaza, Kimpanzu ye Kinlaza makukwa matatu malambila Kongo\\" (Kinkanga, Kimpanzu and Kinlaza are the three stones on which Kongo cooked) The compromise candidate Since 1567, the House of Kwilu had ruled Kongo. When its king, √Ålvaro III, died in 1622, he had no heir old enough to assume the throne. The electors decided to grant the throne to Pedro II Nkanga a Mvika, the Duke of Mbamba. In Portuguese documents, the ruling house of King Pedro II is called Nsundi for the duchy the founding king's father ruled. The line of kings from the House of Kwilu virtually ended overnight (Ambr√≥sio I being the lone exception from 1626 to 1631). Split with Portugal The ascension of the House of Nsundi meant the end of what had become a tenuous relationship between Kongo and Portugal. The once close allies had fallen out over slaving and trade rights toward the end of the 16th century. The ambitious governor of the Portuguese colony in Luanda claimed that the king had given asylum to runaway slaves while Duke of Mbamba. Furthermore, he also claimed the right to appoint kings of Kongo. This led to a Portuguese invasion of Kongo the very year of King Pedro II's rise. The gross miscalculation of the Portuguese resulted in the king leading a force which crushed the invasion at the Battle of Mbandi Kasi. Diplomacy with the Dutch After the disastrous war, the Portuguese sought peace with the House of Nsundi and calm was restored for a little while. Meanwhile, Pedro II harbored plans to remove the Portuguese from his region altogether and sought Dutch assistance to this aim. It would be up to another ruling house; however, to see these plans through.  Garcia I  Garcia I succeeded his father as head of the house in 1624, but when he was overthrown by Manuel Jord√£o, the Duke of Nsundi in 1626, he fled to Soyo. There he was protected by the Count Paulo of Soyo for many years, as he had been appointed by Pedro II. As a result, Soyo formed a close bond with the house. A number of other appointees by Pedro II or Garcia remained in their offices even as other houses ruled Kongo. In 1656, members of the house that held office in S√£o Salvador and the Marquis of Mpemba tried to overthrow Garcia II, and were defeated and the kanda was destroyed as a separate entity in 1678.

In Thomas (the Tank Engine) & Friends, the Island of Sodor is home to the narrow-gauge Skarloey Railway which runs up into the hills. These lines and the engines that work on them are some of the oldest on the island. The narrow-gauge railway has some contact with The Fat Controller's standard-gauge engines (mostly at Crovan's Gate), however the location of the railway often leaves the narrow-gauge engines in relative isolation.https://web.archive.org/web/20180814203906/http://www.sodor- island.net/railwayseries/skarloey.htm Skarloey Railway Skarloey Skarloey is one of the oldest engines on the Island of Sodor. Skarloey lives and works on the Skarloey Railway as Engine No.1. He speaks with a Welsh accent. He is painted red (formerly crimson) with white and gold lining. Skarloey has a friend named Rheneas. When Skarloey first appeared in Season 4, he had not worked in some time, but soon proved his worth once more. He is a dedicated worker and very wise. Skarloey first appeared in season 4, and has appeared in every season since, except seasons 8, 13, 14, 15 and 19. Voice actors * Keith Wickham (UK, Blue Mountain Mystery onwards) * Tomohisa As≈ç (Japan, Seasons 4-7) * Hideyuki Umezu (Japan, Season 9 onwards, excluding The Great Race) * Hiroaki Tajiri (Japan, The Great Race only) Rheneas Rheneas is one of the oldest engines on the Island of Sodor, along with Skarloey and Duke. Rheneas lives and works on the Skarloey Railway as Engine No. 2, and is known as \\"The Gallant Little Engine\\" because he saved the railway from closure. Rheneas is painted vermilion (formerly red) with gold and black stripes. He was Skarloey's twin brother in The Railway Series, but in the television series, they are just referred to as friends. Rheneas was first featured in the 4 season, in which Skarloey told of how Rheneas' dedication saved the railway despite considerable obstacles. This dedication earned Rheneas extensive repairs, and he was touted as a hero on his return. Since returning, Rheneas has worked diligently on the narrow-gauge railway on Sodor. Rheneas is based on Dolgoch, a locomotive found on the Talyllyn Railway. Rheneas first appeared in season 4 and has appeared in seasons 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, and 21.

Sir Handel is named after the owner of the Skarloey Railway, Sir Handel Brown. Sir Handel is painted blue (formerly dark blue) with red stripes. He was originally called Falcon when he lived on the Mid Sodor Railway with Duke and Stuart (now known as Peter Sam). When the railway closed, he and Stuart were sold to the Sodor Aluminium Company, and then later to the Skarloey Railway, where he was renamed Sir Handel and given a red coat of paint. He had problems with staying on the track, so he was fitted with a set of wheels with wide tyres, nicknamed \\"steamroller wheels\\" by the other engines. He was taken to pieces for a television programme when he pretended to be ill. Later, he was sent to the Talyllyn Railway in Wales when one of their engines needed repairs. Most recently, he caused trouble for the Thin Controller by deliberately damaging his firebox. In The Railway Series, Sir Handel was given the Skarloey Railway's red livery, although he was always painted blue (excluding the tenth-twelfth series) in the TV series. Sir Handel is based on Sir Haydn, a locomotive found on the Talyllyn Railway. Sir Handel first appeared in season 4 and has appeared in seasons 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23 and 24.

He has green paint (formerly dark green) with red stripes, red nameplates, and the number 4. Peter Sam was bought by an aluminium company after Mid-Sodor shut down, then later was sold to the Skarloey Railway with Sir Handel, and often ended up apologising for his old friend's behaviour. Coaches and slate cars alike found him polite and easy to get along with, so he quickly became a useful addition to the railway. Following an accident with some slate cars, Peter Sam's funnel was knocked off by an icicle hanging in a tunnel, so Peter Sam had to use a drainpipe for a funnel instead. However, the replacement funnel was square and strange- looking. The other engines made fun of the new funnel until they discovered how well Peter Sam worked because of it. Unlike the Skarloey Railway of the books, where all the locomotives are painted red, in the TV series each is painted a different colour: Peter Sam retains his original green colour from The Mid-Sodor Railway. Peter Sam first appeared in season 4, and has appeared every season since, except seasons 8, 13, 14, and 19. He along with Duke and Sir Handel were illustrated in concept art for season 15's Kevin the Steamie but don't appear in the final cut.

He also occasionally pulls trucks and, when the railway is very busy, passenger trains. He is one of the kinder diesels on the Island, and he is always trying to make his friends happier. Rusty is painted orange, with his number painted on both sides in white, but in The Railway Series, he is painted black. He is No. 5 on the Skarloey Railway. He speaks with a West Country accent. Rusty came to the railway to help maintain the line, pulling trains of workmen and equipment around the railway. Rusty is fearless, practical, and friendly and he quickly becoming friends with the other engines. Although Duncan can be rude to him, he always apologises after Rusty has helped him out. He was one of many engines to make the transition from The Railway Series to the TV Series in Season 4. When he was painted black in The Railway Series, he had a similar nameplate to the steam engines. Rusty is based on Midlander, a diesel locomotive found on the Talyllyn Railway. Rusty first appeared in Season 4, and has appeared in every season since until season 12, except season 8. He briefly returned from seasons 16 to 18. He has been seen again in season 24.

Despite the fact that Duncan is prone to grumble and complain about being overworked, Peter Sam refers to Duncan as \\"keeping busy and meaning well\\". He tends to have a mind of his own which makes him obstinate and hot-tempered on occasions. He is also known for swaying on the track dangerously, which his driver calls \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\", and is often portrayed with a Scottish accent. Despite his rough ways, Duncan is a good-hearted, well-meaning, and hard-working steam train with a big heart. He was painted red in The Railway Series. In the TV Series, he is painted yellow with gold and black lining. Duncan is based on Douglas, a locomotive found on the Talyllyn Railway. For a period after 2010, the real version of the engine carries a character face, name and color. Duncan first appeared in Season 4, and has appeared in seasons 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 20, 22 and 23. He was mentioned in one episode of Season 16, \\"Don't Bother Victor!\\" During the production of Blue Mountain Mystery, Nitrogen Studios went to the Talyllyn Railway to take photographs and measurements of the engines to use as reference for the CGI models of the Skarloey characters. Unfortunately, Duncan's basis, Douglas, was being overhauled and couldn't be measured. This explains why Duncan never returned until the eighteenth series.

He is colored brown, with his name displayed on both sides. He was named after his grace, the Duke of Sodor, and whenever anything went wrong he would exclaim, \\"That would never suit his Grace!\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180814163406/http://www.sodor- island.net/railwayseries/duke.htm Duke lived and worked on a now-closed railway with Stuart and Falcon (Sir Handel and Peter Sam). He was the oldest engine on the line, and liked everything to be \\"just so\\". This prompted Falcon and Stuart to give him the nickname \\"Granpuff\\". When the railway closed in 1947, Stuart and Falcon found new homes, but Duke was left behind in his shed. 22 years later in 1969, a group of enthusiasts excavated Duke's shed, and promised to reunite him with Stuart and Falcon. All three were very happy to meet each other again. The story of Duke was based upon a true story about an engine called Coronel Church abandoned in the Brazilian rain forest. Duke would be the first narrow-gauge engine in the series to have a tender, even though he was also the first engine introduced on Sodor to not have buffers. Duke himself is based on the engine Prince, a Festiniog Railway 0-4-0TT engine on the Ffestiniog Railway at Porthmadog, North Wales. He only physically appeared in Series 4 with him having speaking in four of the episodes of that season. However, his painting appeared in a signal box throughout series 5, and then he had cameos later. Due to production costs, in the fifth season, Duke's model was repainted dark brown and turned into Bertram, who also wore Smudger's face. Voice actors * Masaharu Sat≈ç (Japan, Season 4) Ivo Hugh Ivo Hugh is the Skarloey Railway's No.7, built in New Little Engine at Crovan's Gate Works. He was named after the line's Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME), who was one half of the two-man train crew in the final days of two- engine operation, alongside The Thin Controller. He became Rusty's driver, upon the diesel locomotive's arrival. Hugh had retired by the time of New Little Engine and had the honour of having the railway's new No. 7 named after him. Ivo Hugh is based on Talyllyn Railway's No. 7 Tom Rolt. His son succeeded him as the new CME. Bertram Bertram is an old dark brown engine who worked near an isolated mine on Sodor. He is known as the 'Old Warrior' because of his bravery. He remained at the mine until it was rediscovered years later. Toby thought he was a ghost at first, but the two were later introduced and became friends. Bertram now works at the restored mines, taking passengers to the fairground at the site. Bertram only appeared in Series 5. His body was just Duke's model repainted a darker brown colour with red lining and his face was taken from Smudger. According to Britt Allcroft, Bertram was intended to be a tank engine. As a result of him reusing Duke's model, Bertram is based upon the Festiniog Railway 0-4-0TT. Mighty Mac Mighty Mac are a double-ended Fairlie locomotive, and the newest addition to the Skarloey Railway. Despite the opposing personalities of the two ends, they are technically one engine - one that is painted royal blue with yellow and red stripes. Mighty is the \\"older\\" half distinguished by a small flick of hair and Mac is the \\"younger\\" and he is distinguished by his youthful features, round nose, and freckled cheeks. Prior to their adoption into the Skarloey Railway family, Mighty Mac has had only ever worked in the shunting yards for a long time. Their conflicting personality placed themselves and their passengers in danger while running an important errand. But with Thomas' advice in mind, they were able to complete their task and realise the value of working together. Mighty Mac is based on a Double Fairlie locomotive from the Ffestiniog Railway. Mighty Mac made their debut in Season 9 of Thomas & Friends, in an episode of the same name. They later appeared in seasons 10, 11, and 12, and also in The Great Discovery. Voice actors * Taketoshi Kawano (Japan, Season 9 onwards) Fearless Freddie Fearless Freddie is an old warhorse engine who returned to the narrow-gauge lines after many years. He carries the Number 7, and is painted gray with black, gold and red livery. He and Sir Handel were close friends when they were younger. Upon returning home, Freddie was challenged by Rheneas and Skarloey to a series of races up and down the mountain. When he realised he wasn't as strong or fast as he once was, Freddie used his knowledge of the mountain routes and short-cuts to secure victories. However, when his cheating placed Rheneas in danger, Freddie was forced to put his knowledge to better use and help Rheneas. Freddie is based on Russell, a locomotive found on the Welsh Highland Heritage Railway in North Wales. Freddie first appeared in season 10 and also appeared in seasons 11 and 12. He also appeared in the special The Great Discovery. Voice actors * Tomohiro Nishimura (Japan, Season 10 onwards) Luke Luke is a little green narrow-gauge tank engine who came to the Island of Sodor at the same time as Victor. Luke has had many adventures, like befriending a deer and sending it to the Estate and switching jobs with Millie. During his visit to the castle, he couldn't find the Groundskeeper's lodge, and he went so fast he bumped his carriage and passengers, but soon he learned to be patient and calm. Luke appears to be based on a Kerr Stuart Wren locomotive with an enclosed cab with doors added and added buffers. He carries the number 22 on his sides. Luke was introduced in Blue Mountain Mystery, and has appeared in every season since, except season 19. He also had a supporting role in King of the Railway and cameoed in Journey Beyond Sodor. Voice actors * Michael Legge (UK, Blue Mountain Mystery onwards) * Wataru Hatano (Japan, Blue Mountain Mystery onwards) North Western Railway Victor Victor is a dark red Hispanic tank engine in charge of the Sodor Steamworks. He supervises all the engines who journey in and out of the workshops, as well as Kevin, the clumsy yard crane. Victor always has a helpful, constructive disposition and is good- humored with everyone he meets. He speaks with a Cuban accent and spoke Spanish when he first came to Sodor. Victor was introduced in the feature- length special Hero of the Rails. The show's staff were researching real-life engine workshops as inspiration for the Steamworks when they learned that one had a self-contained narrow-gauge line, used to transport parts internally. The staff decided they wanted an engine with a cab, and chose as a prototype ALCo's #1173, which was specially built for a sugar plantation line in Cuba. Some artistic licence was taken, as the original #1173 is a standard-gauge locomotive. In Blue Mountain Mystery, it is revealed that Victor originally came to Sodor with Luke. Back then, he was painted bright yellow. Because Victor did not speak the same language as Luke or the crew on the ship, they could not understand him. While at sea, the chains holding Victor down to the deck of the ship snapped, causing him to roll freely along the short stretch of track that he was on. When the ship arrived at the docks, Luke asked to be taken up first. Victor tried to tell the crew about his chains, but they still could not understand him, so they did not pay attention. When Luke was lifted off the ship, he accidentally bumped Victor, which sent him rolling backwards along the deck and into the sea. Luckily, Victor was saved by a jetty. It was a long time before he was lifted out, but instead of being sent to the Smelter's Yard, as Luke had thought, he was repaired. To communicate with the workmen, Victor learned their language, his first word being \\"red\\" because it was the color he wanted to be for his new life on Sodor. Victor was introduced in Hero of the Rails and has appeared in every season of the show and in most feature-length specials since, except Tale of the Brave, The Adventure Begins and Big World! Big Adventures!. He also has major supporting roles in Misty Island Rescue, Day of the Diesels, Blue Mountain Mystery, King of the Railway, Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure, The Great Race and Journey Beyond Sodor.

She made her debut in the 2013 movie, King of the Railway, she also debuted in the season 17 episode, The Switch. Millie is a youthful, fun- loving, French narrow-gauge engine who runs on Sir Robert Norramby's (the Earl of Sodor) Estate Railway which includes Ulfstead Castle. In the season 17 episode, The Switch, she learned to work in the Blue Mountain Quarry, that she actually liked tunnels, and she found out that she was stronger than she thought. Millie is based on a Decauville 0-4-0 well tank engine. She is the first female narrow-gauge engine to be introduced in the television series while the Sigrid of Arlesdale is the first female minimum-gauge engine to be in The Railway Series. Millie is painted blue with white lining, with a golden running board, boiler bands and wheel spokes and Sir Robert Norramby's crest on the sides of her cab. Millie first appeared in King of the Railway, and has appeared in every season since, except seasons 19 and 22. Voice actors * Miranda Raison (UK/US, King of the Railway onwards) * Teresa Gallagher (DC Super Friends‚Ñ¢ Minis Mash Ups Origin Story! only) * Minako Saito (Japan, King of the Railway onwards) Culdee Fell Railway Godred The story of Godred (Number 1) is based on the real history of the Snowdon Mountain Railway's locomotive No. 1 L.A.D.A.S. which was destroyed after it derailed on the line's opening day. Similarly, in the story \\"Bad Look-Out\\" the engine Culdee tells the tale of Godred, who falls over the mountain about a month after the railway's opening and was subsequently sent to the back of the shed, and eventually dismantled for spare parts. Despite the fact that it was mentioned at the end of the story that Culdee had made it up, the books \\"The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways\\" and \\"Sodor: Reading Between the Lines\\" reveal that Godred did exist and met his demise when he fell down the mountain. According to Culdee, Godred was self-centered and held too much faith in his automatic brakes. Culdee, Godred's crew and the manager all tried to rectify this, but he never paid attention and paid the price. The Rev. W Awdry wanted the story to be as close to what really happened as much as possible, but did not want to distress the readers so he added that he had made up the story. Ernest Ernest (number 2) appears in the story \\"Danger Points\\" talking to Culdee and Wilfred. Wilfred Wilfred (number 3) first appears telling Culdee of the engines who arrived during his absence, and is later delayed after Lord Harry derails at the summit. He is also seen lecturing Lord Harry about the importance of goods work. Culdee Culdee (number 4) is named after Culdee Fell, the mountain his railway climbs. He is a friendly engine, and has plenty of advice to give to the other engines. He was one of the first engines on the line, being built in 1896, and was used in early test runs on the line. He was also one of the last mountain engines on Sodor to travel to Switzerland for an overhaul. Shane Dooiney Shane Dooiney (number 5) is an engine on this railway who does not actually appear in The Railway Series, although he is mentioned in \\"The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways\\" where he is described as being overhauled in Switzerland during the events of the book Mountain Engines. He is the last engine to be overhauled away from Sodor, all subsequent locomotive maintenance taking place on the island, at the Crovan's Gate Works. Lord Harry/Patrick Lord Harry (number 6) (also called \\"No. 6\\" and \\"Patrick\\") was known as a rude and ignorant trouble-maker on the Culdee Fell Railway. The fact that he was named after Lord Harry Barrane (the chairman of the Mountain Railway Board) and his ultra-modern superheated design made him conceited and led to a habit of unnecessary risk-taking. He even went far as to call Culdee a \\"patched-up old ruin\\". After scaring his coach and derailing at the summit station, blocking both platforms, he was sent to the sheds in disgrace by the manager, Walter Richards. He was stripped of his name and was known only by his number. Passengers refused to trust him and he was reduced to the level of goods engine, transporting hotel supplies and ferrying railway gangers to and from work. After rescuing an injured climber at the mountain summit by pushing the Truck up \\"Devil's Back\\" in a severe gale, he was regarded as a hero and renamed Patrick after the injured climber. Alaric Alaric (number 7) is mentioned in a conversation between Culdee, Wilfred and Ernest in \\"Danger Points\\". He is built to a \\"super-heat\\" design, and has designated passenger coach. He is mentioned for being particularly quite and polite to the other engines. Eric Eric (number 8) is mentioned in a conversation between Culdee, Wilfred and Ernest in \\"Danger Points\\". He is built to a \\"super-heat\\" design. Like Alaric, he is also rather polite and quiet. He also has his own coach. Minor characters Smudger Smudger was a reckless British tank engine who worked on Duke's old railway. Although his real name is \\"Stanley\\", he is known by the nickname \\"Smudger\\". He liked to show off, usually when riding roughly and derailing. Smudger scoffed at Duke's warnings, which prompted the Manager to turn him into a generator behind the engine shed. Nothing is recorded about what happened to Smudger when The Mid Sodor Railway closed in 1947, so that means it is unknown as to whether he has remained there or been scrapped. Smudger was only seen in the series 4 episode \\"Granpuff,\\" substituting a red Baldwin called \\"Number 2\\" from the original story in the Railway Series. Smudger's reused Rheneas' model, but with him being repainted dark green with black stripes. As Smudger reused Rheneas' model, he is based on the Talyllyn Railway No. 2 Dolgoch. Following the fiming of Granpuff, his model was later repainted back into Rheneas and one of his faces was reused for Bertram in series 5. Voice actors * Nobuhiko Kazama (Japan, Series 4) Stanley In the book, Stanley had a tendency to ride roughly on the rails. He is depicted as arrogant and careless, believing that it did not matter if he came off the track occasionally. However, this attitude resulted in his being converted into a pumping engine. He last worked at the Cas-ny-Hawin mine until he broke down in December 1946 and the mine became flooded. With no reason to stay open, the Mid Sodor Railway closed down the next month and Stanley was scrapped. He appeared in one illustration of \\"Duke the Lost Engine\\", as a pumping engine at the back of the engine shed. The engine is only known as \\"No. 2\\" in that book; his name was not revealed until the publication of \\"The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways\\". Stanley is based on a Baldwin Class 10-12-D 4-6-0 pannier tank locomotive. 495 of these locomotives were built by Baldwin and ALCo from 1916 - 1917 to run on the War Department Light Railways trench lines. Stanley's role is taken by Smudger in the television series, who is more akin to Rheneas (indeed, Smudger's model was Rheneas' repainted). Proteus Proteus is a legendary yellow British tank engine who wore a magic lamp upon his funnel. Legend said that anyone who found the lamp would have their wishes granted. As Skarloey told this story to the other Skarloey Railway engines, the clues to finding the magic lamp are a rush of wind, a creaking noise, and a flickering light, the source of the flickering being the magic lamp itself. Peter Sam almost thought he discovered the lamp himself after hearing the story. The other engines have kept him in their minds, and a bronze statue of him has been set up by the railway. Proteus made his first and only physical appearance in the Series 9 episode \\"The Magic Lamp\\", in which his shape was similar to Sir Handel's. He then appeared in the 12th series episode Mountain Marvel as a statue. The name Proteus occurs in Greek Mythology: Proteus was a water-god known as the \\"Old Man of the Sea\\". Rusty's Ghost Engine Rusty's Ghost Engine was a narrow-gauge engine who supposedly worked on the Skarloey Railway. According to Rusty, the engine was returning home one misty full moon night when he lost control on the old iron bridge and fell into a ravine. Men searched in the water, but could not find him, he was never found again, but workmen claim to have seen him trying to get home, only to fail. Rusty told Duncan his story after he teased Peter Sam for allowing his trucks to derail in the ravine. Duncan disbelieved the story, but the next day Duncan's crew arranged things so that Duncan believed the engine was trying to cross the bridge at the same time as him when one misty moonlit night he was taking some slate trucks from the slate incline quarry, and quickly ran back.

The Superintendent and Business Manager are appointed by the school board. The Superintendent is the chief administrative officer with overall responsibility for all aspects of operations, including education and finance. The Business Manager is responsible for budget and financial operations. Neither of these officials are voting members of the School Board. The School Board enters into individual employment contracts for these positions. In Pennsylvania, public school districts are required to give 150 days notice to the Superintendent regarding renewal of the employment contract.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Pennsylvania School Code, 2013 In 2012, the City of York School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education as financially distressed. The PDE appointed a recovery officer, David Meckley to assist the Board in repairing the district's finances. A financial recovery plan was developed. The elected school board resisted acting on the plan. Instead, it approved a new employment contract with the City of York teacher's union which is noncompliant with the financial recovery plan. In response to the Board's resistance to comply, the State Secretary of Education petitioned the Commonwealth Courts to take over the District. Shifting the District to all charter schools is one proposal under consideration. The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives Sunshine Review gave the school board and district administration a \\"C-\\" for transparency based on a review of \\"What information can people find on their school district's website\\". It examined the school district's website for information regarding; taxes, the current budget, meetings, school board members names and terms, contracts, audits, public records information and more. ;Teacher evaluation study In 2011, the District agreed to participate in a pilot program to develop a new way to evaluate public school teachers and principals that, in part, takes into account student achievement. Several York County school districts are participating. The pilot program had 104 K-12 entities, including: nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units. Beginning in January 2012, participating school districts will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation was not used to determine an educator's official 2011‚Äì12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the evaluation of a teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. The other half will be based on student achievement (15 percent will be building-level data, 15 percent will be teacher-specific data, and 20 percent will be elective). The new evaluation system has both announced and unannounced observations.

An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the average teacher salary in the City of York School District was $70,255 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $29,410 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $99,666.

According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In February 2012, Superintendent Dr. Deborah Wortham reported the district was at risk for missing payroll, in April 2012, due to an $8 million budget deficit. She reported that efforts had been made to reduce expenses, including a proposal to cut half-day sessions by an additional hour every other Wednesday and a 3.8 percent reduction in pay for teachers, which the teacher union rejected. Wertham explained that the deficit was a carry over from the prior year's budget deficit of $19 million.Mason, Angie., York City School District faces $8 million deficit for this year, The York Daily Record, February 1, 2012 The state placed the District in Financial Distress status in accordance with Act 141 of 2012.

The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth's high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven instructional practices and to meet the needs of diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High school's applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007‚Äì08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. York City School District was one of 161 PA public school district to apply, receiving $363,000 funding over three years.Robert Hayes Postupac, PROJECT 720: A CASE STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL REFORM, University of Pittsburgh, 2011 For 2010‚Äì11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell.

Federal Stimulus funding York City School District received an extra $9,015,339 in ARRA ‚Äì Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. This federal funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì2010 and 2010‚Äì2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Pennsylvania Senate Education Committee, the Governor and the Pennsylvania School Board Association, to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. School Improvement Grant In 2010, Pennsylvania received $141 million from the federal department of education, to turn around its worst-performing schools. The funds were disbursed via a competitive grant program. The Pennsylvania Department of Education has identified 200 Pennsylvania schools as \\"persistently lowest-achieving,\\" making them eligible for this special funding. Pennsylvania required low performing schools to apply or provide documentation about why they had not applied. The funds must be used, by the district, to turn around schools in one of four ways: school closure, restart ‚Äì close the school and reopen it as a charter school. The other two options involve firing the principal. One would require at least half the faculty in a chronically poor performing school be dismissed. The second involves intensive teacher training coupled with strong curriculum revision or a longer school day. York City School District applied for the grant. Its application was denied by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for various reasons. In 2012, the District applied again receiving $1.5 million in School Improvement grants. McKinley Elementary and William Penn Senior High School adopted a transformation model. Edgar Fahs Smith and Hannah Penn middle schools each received funding under the closure model. Per the grant the money paid for relocation expenses such as movers, boxes, community outreach and orientations at the K-8 schools. Race to the Top grant York City School District officials applied for the Race to the Top federal grant. When approved for the grant, the district would have received millions in additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Due to the districts long term low student achievement tit was identified as a turnaround district. This meant the district would receive an additional $750 per pupil above the base granted amount. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Six York County school districts applied to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of most districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. Common Cents state initiative The York City School Board decided to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.Common Cents program ‚Äì Making Every Dollar Count After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. Real estate taxes The school board levied a real estate tax of 33.7361 mills in 2014‚Äì15. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate ‚Äì land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75‚Äì85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2013‚Äì14 ‚Äì 33.7361 mills *2012‚Äì13 ‚Äì 33.7361 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012‚Äì13, 2012 *2011‚Äì12 ‚Äì 31.0778 mills *2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì 29.5400 mills *2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 29.5400 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports, 2010 *2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 29.5400 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008‚Äì09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 29.5400 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì 29.5400 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005‚Äì06 ‚Äì 27.1900 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by York County residents amounts to about 4.01% of their yearly income.

Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010‚Äì11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

Wellness policy The York City School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 ‚Äì Policy 246.York City School Board Policy Manual The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äì Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs ‚Äì Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least ten percent (10%) of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 To comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013‚Äì2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. York City School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in the schools to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance.

The village Gateside Primary School was opened in 1903, and nowadays it has 74 pupils (2009). The school has an extension built in 1998 which provided indoor toilets and a school hall, which is used by the nursery, PE classes, and for school dinners and assemblies. Another extension is to be built soon. The school is very environmentally aware and has achieved its Green Flag Award (2009). Spier's school stood nearby and the grounds are now a public park used by the Gateside and Beith communities. The Isabel Patrick Memorial Hall is a building in the Gothic style. Trearne House stood near Gateside, but it was demolished and the site is now a large worked out limestone quarry. A field behind the primary school was given to the community by the Marshall family who were the village blacksmiths for many years. The meaning of Powgree, Gateside's burn, is suggested as being 'Stream of the herd (of deer)'.Johnston, J. B. (1903). Place-names of Scotland. Edinburgh : David Douglas. Page 248.

The Court Hill Gateside from the Hill of Beith old farm site The Court Hill of the Abbot of Kilwinning near the village A Moot hill or Court Hill survives near Gateside at Bog hall in the old Barony of Beith. Dobie states that the Abbot of Kilwinning used it to administered justice to his vassals & tenants. It is a sub-oval, flat-topped mound, situated at the foot of a small valley. A number of large stones are visible in the sides of the mound. It is turf- covered, situated on a low outcrop, and is mostly an artificial work. It pre- dates the channelling of the Boghall Burn which detours around it, the mound was probably isolated in this once marshy outflow of the former Boghall Loch (see NS35SE 14).RCAHMS Canmore archaeology site Hill of Beith Castle, a square tower castle, once held by the Cunninghame family, stood near to the moot hill.Smith, John (1895). Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire. Pub. Elliot Stock. P. 81. Boghall Loch Loch Brand or Bran was the name by which Boghall Loch was formerly known. The loch, drained in 1780, is one of the main sources of the Powgree Burn and lay on the lands of Boghall and Hill o'Beith.

Limestone and marble The drained Boghall Loch above Gateside, source of the Powgree Burn The old Crooked Dam millpond site on the Powgree Burn in the Fairy Glen The underlying geology of this part of Ayrshire is such that the presence of limestone quarries is to be expected. Lime kilns to produce quicklime for improving the soil, were a common feature of the countryside before the process became fully industrialised. Nettlehirst near Barrmill was one of the last large traditionally operated lime kilns to operate, surviving until the 1970s. However, Broadstone has the substantial remains of one of the largest of the early stone built kilns. This must have created considerable pollution in the area, offset only by the employment it created. It sits right next to the limestone quarry which supplied it. The road running past is still known as 'Reek Street'. The narrow gauge and single track 'Hillhead Railway', once ran from the Hillhead Limestone Quarries at Broadstone, down to the railway near Brackenhills railway station on the old line from Giffen to the Glengarnock Steel Works, later the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway branchline to Kilbirnie South. The branchline to Beith via Barrmill did not exist at the time of the lines construction, not opening until 1873. A railway bridge was built to carry the Hillhead Railway over the new line and it must therefore have been fully active at that time. Trearne Quarry looking north Trearne Quarry looking south The Hillhead Railway is shown on the Ordnance Survey (OS) map of 1856, but not on the 1897 edition. The railway ran for several miles across what is now DM Beith land and ended up at first at an unloading point on a siding, where the limestone was emptied directly into standard gauge freight waggons. The map marks a few wooden railway bridges over burns and given the gentle gradients, it may be that the line was at first worked by horses rather than steam locomotives. Later maps show significant changes and record a 'Barkip Junction' and show the line now curving to meet was by then the Kilbirnie branchline. Hillhead Quarry was part of the Broadstone Limestone Works and the original Broadstone Farm was entirely lost to the limestone workings. Hillhead Farm was renamed Broadstone; a farm that still exists. Little remains of the railway apart from a shallow cutting running down from near West Broadstone, the overbridge near the old South Windyhouse Farm on the Barrmill Road and the route running to the site of old Barkip Junction. The old Ordnance Survey maps show that a marble quarry was located nearby, being an especially hard form of limestone that could take a 'polish' and was used extensively for window and door surrounds.

Its founders envisioned a liturgical and educational institution patterned after the all-male English Cathedral choir schools, but situated within the urban context of Chicago. Founded as an outreach ministry of the Episcopal Church of the Epiphany, the school shared space within the church and its parish hall until August 2002. Enrollment was necessarily small (under 30) given the limited amount of space. In August 2002 St. Gregory's moved to the former Blessed Sacrament School building in Chicago's North Lawndale community. With the additional space at its new location, it realized a long term desire to add a kindergarten class. There was also room for a computer lab, a library, a lunchroom and a small parking lot that doubles as a playground. It was closed on 30 June 2010.

P. 49  History  General Roy's survey of 1747 - 55 shows only the farm of High Barr. A village grew up here due to the employment provided by the several limestone quarries that were present at one time, the Dockra Ironstone pit that was located near the railway line down from Dockra quarry in 1912, and other local industries. The old thread mill offices Barrmill from near the old mill offices. The wall to the left is the frontage of old mill workers' cottages. The village that developed had a population of 300 in 1876 and 600 in 1951, when the threadmaking industry had just ceased, although the workers still lived in company houses and were transported daily to the threadmaking factory at Kilbirnie. This mill was founded in the mid-19th century to make linen thread, much used at the time for boot and shoe making, and for sailmaking; an offshoot of the much larger linen thread mills at Kilbirnie. The largest of the mill buildings was a three-storeyed, flat-roofed mill, with a fireproof interior with brick arches on cast iron columns. In front is a section of a range of single-storeyed, north-lit sheds. In 1965 the buildings were being used as a fertiliser factory. The mill buildings have been demolished, but the offices still survive.Barr Mill Linen Thread mill. Accessed : 2009-11-19 The limestone works was closed in 1972. The whinstone quarries of Messrs.

Page 43 These houses, some of which housed quarry workers, lie close to a 20th-century limestone quarry nearby, now abandoned and filled with water. The area had many small limestone and ironstone quarries. Dockra and Broadstone quarries are quite nearby. Around 30 people were employed here in the 1930s.  Cholera outbreak  The stile leading to the Dead Man's Planting with Barrmill conservation volunteers. Detail of the site of the old Cholera pit below South Barr farm in 2012, known locally as the 'Deid mans plantin' In 1832 around forty local youths died from cholera within a week of visiting a Gipsy encampment to have their fortunes told and were buried in a triangular Cholera pit plot at the base of Jameshill, lying to the south-west of Barrmill village. No record of the people buried here seems to exist and it is likely that they were buried without any religious observance. Troops were regularly placed at road junctions to prevent entry or exit during cholera outbreaks and normal burial in the Beith parish cemetery was impossible and impractical, given the number of deaths. As is usual for such sites a remote spot was selected, well away from water courses. No health risk remains today. In 1908 the local paper recorded that not even a fence surrounded the spot and a resident of Barrmill suggested that a suitable stone and a fence should be erected to mark the resting place of the unfortunate ancestors of Barrmill residents and also to recognise the sacredness of the burial site.Reid, Page 81 Wilhelmina Boyd records that in the 1930s the local children regarded the site as 'sacred ground' and wouldn't walk on it. The burial site is located on the lands of South Barr Farm and was at one time fenced off and bordered by trees, kept in order thanks to the Crawford Brothers of the old factory until they died. It has been neglected since then, however a stile and footbridge were built by the Barrmill Conservation Group in 2012 to allow easier access to the site which also has a Geocache.Porterfield, S. (1925). Rambles Round Beith. Beith : Pilot Press. p. 35. In 2014 the Barrmill Conservation Group built a new fence around the cholera pit site.  Dockra  Extensive limestone quarrying took place at Dockra with a mineral line running down to join with the Beith to Lugton line. Limekilns were located at the site, as were gunpowder magazines, a mine manager's house, a large bing, etc. The quarry is now flooded, but not infilled.

DM Beith  The last stretch of the railway line before the depot from Drumbuie Bridge in 2008 The line and an old signal looking towards the closed Giffen station and DM Beith A large Defence Munitions (DM) centre is located between Beith and Barrmill. The site was originally developed in 1943 as a conventional Royal Naval Armaments Depot, munitions store, for the Royal Navy. The railway is no longer used for transporting items to the depot, due to the delicate nature of modern complex armaments, the last trains running in 1996 although the trackwork remains intact within the depot (2014).DM Beith Locals relate how the engine drivers used to park their train at the overbridge and walk up to the shop to get a drink and a snack. The line saw the occasional MOD passenger train when conferences or inspections were being held at the 'Admiralty'. There were five farms which were taken over by the Ministry of Defence for them to establish the Royal Naval Armaments Depot. Boyd's of Drumbuie, Jacks o' the Ward; Crawfords o' the Scoup; Harpers o' the White Spot; and Blairs of the Bugstone, Boyd of the Bellcraig, Gillies of Gatend and a number of railworkers and farm workers who lived in Patrick Row which was located on Barkip Road near to what is now the main entrance to the depot.

Bankhead is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), making it significant in the European context. The moss lies entirely within the DM Beith site and therefore access is restricted. Giffen Colliery, bing and freight railway line were once located on the southern side of the moss as shown by the old OS maps of the area; a railway also cut across the northern edge of the moss, however the main part of the moss has been largely untouched by industry although it is grazed by farm animals. The site is monitored by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). Matthew Anderson Matthew, known as the 'Policemen-Poet of Ayrshire', was posted to Barrmill for a number of years, leaving for Kilmarnock in June 1896. He wrote a number of poems about the district, such as 'Farewell to Barrmill', 'The Braes o'Barrmill', and 'Night at Barrmill.' Olympic Torch Olympic Torch swapover at Barrmill. On 8 June 2012 the Olympic Flame visited Barrmill. Barrmill's Olympic Flame Committee provided hundreds of people, young and older, with a series of events to mark the day. The village was decorated with hanging baskets, banners, colourful flowerbeds, and everywhere had been swept, weeded and the grass in the park freshly cut. Apart from the Olympic Flame runners many other VIP's guests were present, such as the Provost and Deputy- Provost, the NAC Chief Executive, the NAC Citizen of the Year (Jean Gilbert), NAC councillors, pupils and staff from Glengarnock Primary School, and representatives of the Chinese, Sikh, and Polish communities. Barrmillians were out in force and supporting attractions that included bouncy castles, Chinese Dragon dancers, book and postcard sales, the Olympic Flame time capsule, a piper, an international food fair, Threepwood sweets, mini- Olympics, Play Ranger Walks, a labyrinth, sport tasters, health checks, massage, vintage cars, an art exhibition, the Village Shop, tea and cakes, etc. A 'Bothy Night' with live musical entertainment took place with profits going to the new Community Centre appeal. The time capsule was sealed in its cairn in August 2012 to be opened in 2036 by the oldest resident in the district at that time. Vale View Garden The Vale Grove on day three of the filming of the Beechgrove Garden programme. Over a period of two months in 2012 the Barrmill Conservation Group created a new garden, the Vale View, as part of The Beechgrove Garden programme. The Barrmill 'Best Kept Garden' competition formed part of the programme. The work involved over a hundred people during the three days of filming and many more on the thirty or so workdays before the filming dates. Jeremy Needham, a lecturer at SAC Auchencruive, was the garden designer, working with the group to create a community resource to complement the existing Vale Grove site in Barrmill Park. Many other groups contributed to the work, such as Community Payback, Greenbelt, The Conservation Volunteers, North Ayrshire Council, Youth Making Beith Better, Redburn Activity Agreement Group, the Outreach Group, the Barrmill and District Community Association, etc. Many local businesses donated items and materials for the project. In August 2012 quince trees was planted in the orchard area by the provost and deputy provost to commemorate the visit. Micro-history Some of the members of the BCPI in 2010 The restored appearance of the village shop in 2011 In 2013 a Bioblitz and Citizen Science event took place through which locals were trained in some basic identification skills and the whole district was subject to a thorough biological survey. In 2012 local resident Jean Gilbert was voted in as the North Ayrshire Citizen of the Year in recognition for all the work that Jean and her team have done to enhance the social life and surroundings of Burnhouse, Greenhills and Barrmill. In 2013 Jean was awarded an MBE. The news that the war in South Africa has at last been brought to an end by the surrender of the Boers was known in Barrmill in June 1902 when the early papers arrived. At Barrmill the villagers gave full vent to their joy by knocking off at the breakfast hour and compelling the master at Greenhills to set the scholars free.End of Boer War The 'Dusk Rovers' were a local football team that played on a pitch located on a field near the old Giffen Viaduct and Dusk water; allowing the ploy of losing the ball into the Dusk Water or onto the nearby railway if the game was not going well.Gilbert, Tom & Grace (2010). Windyhouse Farm. The Giffen railway viaduct was demolished in the 1980s; locals knew it as the 'Navvies Brig'. In 2010 a Barrmill Communities Projects Initiatives (BCPI) group was set up by the Community and District Association and the NAC Ranger Service to improve the appearance of the Barrmill, Greenhills, and Burnhouse villages. One achievement was the creation of the Veil Grove amenity within Barrmill Park. In 2011 the Save the Children Fund employed an Environmental Artist to create living willow shelters in Barrmill Park. The site of the Black Loch The Black Loch was a shallow loch situated near Nettlehirst House and the old Giffen Viaduct; it was once used for curling. The site was filled with earth and is now overgrown.Jamieson, Sheila (1997). Our Village. Greenhills Women's Institute. p. 27Reid, Donald L. (2010). Beith, Barrmill & Gateside.

Many teams from elsewhere in Ayrshire came here to compete and the unofficial betting sometimes resulted in heated exchanges. Peter Wilson played for Celtic and Scotland in the 1920s and he was also a noted quoiting prodigy, defeating many top players to win a tournament held to raise funds for the Red Cross.Reid, Donald L.

This was mainly an issue in early PCs. Chip creep occurs due to thermal expansion, which is expansion and contraction as the system heats up and cools down. It can also occur due to vibration. While chip creep was most common with older memory modules, it was also a problem with CPUs and other main chips that were inserted into sockets. An example is the Apple III, where its CPU would be dislodged and the user would need to reseat the chips. To fix chip creep, users of older systems would often have to remove the case cover and push the loose chip back into the socket. Today's computer systems are not as affected by chip creep, since chips are more securely held, either by various types of retainer clips or by being soldered into place, and since system cooling has improved.

A team of experts was appointed and a first volume of the MHSI was published in Madrid in 1894. When the Jesuit Historical Institute was established in Rome (1930) the work was carried on from there.

There have been illustrative photographs made since the medium's invention, for example in the earliest staged photographs, such as Hippolyte Bayard's Self Portrait as a Drowned Man (1840). However, the term Conceptual Photography derives from Conceptual Art a movement of the late 1960s. Today the term is used to describe either a methodology or a genre. Conceptual photography as a methodology As a methodology conceptual photography is a type of photography that is staged to represent an idea. The 'concept' is both preconceived and, if successful, understandable in the completed image. It is most often seen in advertising and illustration where the picture may reiterate a headline or catchphrase that accompanies it. Photographic advertising and illustration commonly derive from Stock photography, which is often produced in response to current trends in image usage as determined by the research of picture agencies like Getty Images or Corbis. These photographs are therefore produced to visualize a predetermined concept. The advent of picture editing software like Adobe Photoshop has allowed the greater manipulation of images to seamlessly combine elements that previously it would only have been possible to combine in graphic illustration. Conceptual photography as a genre The term 'conceptual photography' used to describe a genre may refer to the use of photography in Conceptual Art or in contemporary art photography. In either case, the term is not widely used or consistently applied. Conceptual photography and conceptual art Conceptual art of the late 1960s and early 1970s often involved photography to document performances, ephemeral sculpture or actions. The artists did not describe themselves as photographers, for example Edward Ruscha said \\"Photography's just a playground for me. I'm not a photographer at all.\\"A.D. Coleman (10 September 1972), \\"I'm Not Really A Photographer\\", The New York Times. These artists are sometimes referred to as conceptual photographers but those who used photography extensively such as John Hilliard and John Baldessari and Pedram Mousavi are more often described as photoconceptualistsMelanie Marino, Disposable Matter: Photoconceptual Magazine Work of the 1960s, in The Last Picture Show - Artists using photography 1960‚Äì1982, Douglas Fogle, 2003 or \\"artists using photography\\". Conceptual photography and fine-art photography Since the 1970s artists using photography like Cindy Sherman and latterly Thomas Ruff and Thomas Demand have been described as conceptual. Although their work does not generally resemble the lo-fi aesthetic of 1960s conceptual art they may use certain methods in common such as documenting performance (Sherman), typological or serial imagery (Ruff) or the restaging of events (Demand). In fact the indebtedness to these and other approaches from Conceptual Art is so widespread in contemporary Fine-art photography that almost any work might be described as conceptual. The term has perhaps been used most specifically in a negative sense to distinguish some contemporary art photography from documentary photography or Photojournalism. This distinction has been made in the coverage of the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize.Sean O'Hagan, (16 November 2009), Why conceptual photography is having a prized moment The Guardian Conceptual photography is often used interchangeably with Fine-Art Photography, and there has been some dispute about whether there is a difference between the two. However, the central school of thought is that conceptual photography is a type of fine-art photography. Fine art Photography is inclusive of conceptual photography. While all conceptual photography is fine art, not all fine art is conceptual.

Biography Gross was born in Vienna and emigrated to England in 1938. From the age of fourteen, he worked as a pianist in bands and orchestras. He studied at Trinity College of Music, with Wilfrid Dunwell (piano), and the University of Aberdeen, with (amongst others) Reginald Barrett-Ayres, and where he received an MA in 1957 (; ). Following professional engagements in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and New Caledonia, he settled in Sydney in 1958. Initially teaching at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music, he joined the staff of the Department of Music at the University of Sydney in 1960 and remained there until retiring in 1991 as Associate Professor of Music. In 1989 he was visiting Professor at the University of Guyana. He was President of the Fellowship of Australian Composers, and from 1981 to 1984 he was also Treasurer and Executive Board Member of the Asian Composers' League. Apart from teaching, Gross was active as composer, arranger and conductor. He received numerous commissions for film scores for Film Australia and TV scores for Screen Gems Columbia, as well as numerous commissions from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1976 he received the Albert H. Maggs Composition Award from Melbourne University. While working as a conductor of the Pro Musica Society of Sydney University and the St. Andrew's Cathedral Choral Society, Gross wrote numerous works for the orchestras and choirs associated with these societies. Political statements were made in the orchestral work Na Shledanou v Praze (premiered in Olomouc, Czechoslovakia during a period of Russian occupation) which used the Czech national anthem as its main theme. In other works, such as the cantata Pacem in Terris (based on the encyclical by Pope John XXIII), Gross used pertinent philosophical or political texts. He is also well known for Dussekiana I-III, three suites for violin and orchestra, based on piano works by Franti≈°ek Xaver Du≈°ek . In addition to a predilection for jazz idioms, Gross's worldwide travels and cultural experiences tended to give his music a cosmopolitan flavour, with traces of Austrian, Scottish, Asian and South American influences emerging from time to time. He also enjoyed experimentation, especially when a sympathetic virtuoso or ensemble such as bass-baritone Alan Light, trombonist Greg van der Struik or Adrian Hooper's Sydney Mandolins, was available. Gross was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1998 . On Australia Day 2006 he was declared to be the City of Canada Bay Cultural and Artistic Citizen of the Year. He remained active as a composer and examiner until shortly before his death, which occurred on 17 April 2011 . His wife Pamela died less than a week before he did .

Ehrman, a New Testament scholar at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Interview with Bart Ehrman, Publishers Weekly, January 25, 2006. The book introduces lay readers to the field of textual criticism of the Bible. Ehrman discusses a number of textual variants that resulted from intentional or accidental manuscript changes during the scriptorium era. The book made it to The New York Times Best Seller List.Publisher's website. HarperCollins.com. Summary Ehrman recounts his personal experiences with the study of the Bible and textual criticism. He summarizes the history of textual criticism, from the works of Desiderius Erasmus to the present. The book describes an early Christian environment in which the books that would later compose the New Testament were copied by hand, mostly by Christian amateurs. Ehrman concludes that various early scribes altered the New Testament texts in order to de-emphasize the role of women in the early church, to unify and harmonize the different portrayals of Jesus in the four gospels, and to oppose certain heresies (such as Adoptionism).  Reviews and reception  Alex Beam of the Boston Globe, wrote that the book is \\"a series of dramatic revelations for the ignorant\\", and that \\"Ehrman notes that there have been a lot of changes to the Bible in the past 2,000 years. I don't want to come between Mr. Ehrman and his payday, but this point has been made much more eloquently by... others.\\" (behind paywall) Jeffrey Weiss of The Dallas Morning News wrote, \\"Whichever side you sit on regarding Biblical inerrancy, this is a rewarding read.\\" The American Library Association wrote, \\"To assess how ignorant or theologically manipulative scribes may have changed the biblical text, modern scholars have developed procedures for comparing diverging texts. And in language accessible to nonspecialists, Ehrman explains these procedures and their results. He further explains why textual criticism has frequently sparked intense controversy, especially among scripture-alone Protestants.\\" Charles Seymour of the Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, Texas wrote, \\"Ehrman convincingly argues that even some generally received passages are late additions, which is particularly interesting in the case of those verses with import for doctrinal issues such as women's ordination or the Atonement.\\" Neely Tucker of The Washington Post wrote that the book is \\"an exploration into how the 27 books of the New Testament came to be cobbled together, a history rich with ecclesiastical politics, incompetent scribes and the difficulties of rendering oral traditions into a written text.\\" Craig Blomberg, of Denver Seminary in Colorado, wrote that \\"Most of Misquoting Jesus is actually a very readable, accurate distillation of many of the most important facts about the nature and history of textual criticism, presented in a lively and interesting narrative that will keep scholarly and lay interest alike.\\" Blomberg also wrote that Ehrman \\"has rejected his evangelicalism and whether he is writing on the history of the transmission of the biblical text, focusing on all the changes that scribes made over the centuries, or on the so-called 'lost gospels' and 'lost Christianities,' trying to rehabilitate our appreciation for Gnosticism, it is clear that he has an axe to grind.\\" In 2007, Timothy Paul Jones wrote a book-length response to Misquoting Jesus, called Misquoting Truth: A Guide to the Fallacies of Bart Ehrman's \\"Misquoting Jesus\\". It was published by InterVarsity Press. Novum Testamentum suggested that Misquoting Truth was a useful example of how conservative readers are reacting to Ehrman.

He is called Sabictas by Arrian,Anab. ii. 4. and was almost certainly a native Cappadocian. Abistamenes was the successor to Mithrobuzanes, the last Achaemenid satrap of Cappadocia. Mithrobouzanes was killed at the Battle of the Granicus in 334, and Abistamenes was thereafter appointed satrap by Alexander the Great, although his hold over Cappadocia appears to have been weak, as Cappadocian soldiers were found fighting for King Darius III of Persia during the Battle of Gaugamela in 331. Abistamenes may no longer even have been in power at that point, however, as he seems to disappear in the wake of the Battle of Issus in 333. The rule of Abistamenes was certainly long done by the time of Alexander's death in 323, when the entirety of Cappadocia was given by Alexander's heirs to Eumenes to govern.

Cannes Programme EICAR arranges for 30 of its students to become reporters for a week at the Cannes Film Festival, allocating places on a competitive basis. The International Film School of Paris strongly believes that a film education must be as practical as possible. We trust that the best classroom for young filmmakers is the actual shooting environment. Film directing students, regardless of whichever programme they are in, are producing short exercises or films weekly. The Paris international Film School is a college offering students worldwide the opportunity of specializing in film studies in a professional environment where the quality of personal films is pursued to the outmost and where students are given the opportunity of developing their creative and technical knowledge through the practical creation of scripts to the manipulation of sophisticated professional equipment and on to the post production and screening of their films in front of a public and a panel of judges. The school gathers virtually all media crafts within one training location therefore encouraging students to learn how to work together, just like in the film industry. Young film directors work closely with technical trainees and aspiring actors, which is as close to the real thing you can get as a student. On the more individual basis the interaction between professor and student at EICAR is encouraged. The practical courses are conducted in small groups enabling the students to improve their communication skills and the art of management, two fundamental attributes required in order to create and sustain a team throughout the shooting of a film.

He is remembered as \\"father of the third rail\\",Current Biography 1942, p. 33 a pioneer in electrical engineering, and an urban mass transportation expert who helped design New York's Interborough Rapid Transit subway system. He also served as a lieutenant colonel during World War I in the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. Early life He was born in Casnovia, Michigan on August 14, 1861. Civilian career After graduating from Hillsdale College in Michigan and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1897, Arnold set up his own company in Chicago at a time when railroads were converting their power sources from steam to electricity. In 1898, Arnold developed a new method of converting alternating current from power plants to direct current in substations for the Chicago & Milwaukee Electric Railway. This innovative electrification system would eventually become a standard in the interurban and street railway industries. Between 1898 and 1912, he assisted the New York Central Railroad and the Hudson River Railroad in conversion of their lines leading into the Grand Central Terminal. When the IRT opened in 1904, the subway proved to be more popular than envisioned. By 1908, a system designed for a maximum of 600,000 passengers per day was being used by 800,000. Arnold was called upon again to solve the problem. His solution was to place automatic speed control devices on the trains themselves, so that more trains could be run during each hour.Clifton Hood, \\"The Impact of the IRT on New York City\\", Historical American Engineering Record survey number HAER NY-122, pp. 146‚Äì147, from www.nycsubway.org/articles/haer-impact-irt, retrieved September 3, 2007 Arnold also assisted in the conversion of electrified railways in Los Angeles and Pittsburgh, and the cable car systems in San Francisco. Arnold was president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1903 to 1904. Military career On December 14, 1917, he transferred to the regular Army as a lieutenant colonel in the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. He was assigned to aircraft equipment production in Washington, DC. He was honorably discharged on Feb. 6, 1919. He was a colonel in the inactive reserve after 1929.

Originally active from c.1985 to c.1995, the band reformed in 2010. The group's sound is a mixture of progressive rock and pop rock styles. History Ark formed from the ashes of Damascus and Kite, in 1985. Having won a following around the Midlands they began to venture further and gained a following around the UK and in parts of Europe. The band's line- up began with Ant Short, Peter Wheatley, Steve Harris, Andy Harris (bass) and Dave Robbins (drums). In 1986 Andy was replaced by John Jowitt and the band first entered the recording studio, the fruit of which were an early set of cassette only singles. In 1987 the band entered a local Battle Of The Bands competition at Edward's Number 8 in Birmingham and won time at The Rich Bitch Recording Studios after beating Slowburner and Fayre Warning in the final. Following the recording session they released the first album: The Dreams Of Mr Jones. It won them several reviews and gained them fans up and down the country. In 1988 Gary Davis replaced Dave Robbins on drums and in 1989 the group changed drummers again, this time bringing in Richard Deane (who had previously played in The First with John Jowitt). With this line-up they recorded and released their New Scientist EP and began touring throughout the UK. In the autumn of 1989 the band toured as the support for IQ, who were playing a short UK tour. It was an association that was to motivate John to move on. In 1990 IQ were looking for a new bass player, and called John. The band parted on good terms and the search was on for a new bass player. It came in the guise of Gel, who had previously played in local \\"mekal\\" bands. They soon set about working towards another tour, but Richard then decided he too wanted to leave, so in early 1991 a young metal drummer Paul Rogers joined the band. The line-up now settled again, set about touring the UK and Europe. After the first recording session with the line-up, the release the Cover Me With Rain EP to much acclaim in the rock press and set about touring both the UK and Northern Europe. Following extensive writing sessions and a very successful recording session, they release the album Spiritual Physics in 1992. Despite good reviews and an increasing fanbase, the major record companies were proving hard to convince and after several long and extensive tours the band decided to call it a day. Paul decided to leave before a final tour, and the band recruited Hugh Edwards on drums to help them say farewell to their fans. Their final gig was on 13 March 1995 at The Flapper & Firkin in Birmingham. Late in 2009 it was confirmed that Ant Short, Peter Wheatley and Steve Harris had reformed Ark, with John Jowitt returning on bass and new member Tim Churchman from Darwin's Radio on drums. New material is being written, and the band is rehearsing for some live dates, including the Summer's End progressive rock festival in October 2010.

In 1881 some two hundred people lived in the village, the mill being at its heart, with a Sunday school, smithy, joiner's shop and Dalgarven House. Most of the women were weavers, dressmakers, farm or domestic servants. The men were stonemasons, joiners, farm labourers, platelayers, railway surfacemen, etc. Monkcastle House is at one end of the village and Smithstone House at the other. The coming of the new road resulted in the demolition of most the village apart from the smithy and a cottage row. A pre- reformation chapel is said to have existed in the vicinity and the old yew tree may be indicative of this.

Remains of E. annectens have been preserved in the Frenchman, Hell Creek, and Lance Formations. All of these formations are dated to the late Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, representing the last three million years before the extinction of the dinosaurs (between 68 and 66 million years agoHoltz, Thomas R. Jr. (2012) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2011 Appendix.). Also, E. annectens is also from the Laramie Formation, and magnetostratigraphy suggests an age of 69-68 Ma for the Laramie Formation.*Hicks, J.F., Johnson, K.R., Obradovich, J.

Edmontosaurus annectens is known from numerous specimens, including at least twenty partial to complete skulls, discovered in the U.S. states of Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado and the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It was a large animal, up to approximately , potentially up to http://saurian.maxmediacorp.com/?p=549 in length, with an extremely long and low skull. E. annectens exhibits one of the most striking examples of the \\"duckbill\\" snout common to hadrosaurs. It has a long taxonomic history, and specimens have at times been classified in the genera Diclonius, Trachodon, Hadrosaurus, Claosaurus, Thespesius, Anatosaurus and Anatotitan, before being grouped together in Edmontosaurus. Discovery and history E. annectens has a complicated taxonomic history, with various specimens having been classified in a variety of genera. Its history involves Anatosaurus, Anatotitan, Claosaurus, Diclonius, Hadrosaurus, Thespesius, and Trachodon, as well as Edmontosaurus. References predating the 1980s typically use Anatosaurus, Claosaurus, Diclonius, Thespesius, or Trachodon for E. annectens fossils, depending on author and date. Cope's Diclonius mirabilis Skeletons (AMNH 5730, right, and AMNH 5886, left), first mounted in the American Museum of Natural History in 1908.\\"26b. What's In a Name: The Trachodon Story\\" ; Paper Dinosaurs (1824-1969): An Exhibition of Original Publications from the Collections of the Linda Hall Library. The history of E. annectens predates both Edmontosaurus and annectens. The first good specimen, the former holotype (specimen on which a taxonomic name is based) of Anatosaurus copei (Anatotitan), was a complete skull and most of a skeleton collected in 1882 by Dr. J. L. Wortman and R. S. Hill for American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. This specimen, found in Hell Creek Formation rocks, came from northeast of the Black Hills of South Dakota and originally had extensive skin impressions. It was missing most of the pelvis and part of the torso due to a stream cutting through it. The bill had impressions of a horny sheath with a tooth-like series of interlocking points on the upper and lower jaws. When describing this specimen AMNH 5730, Cope assigned it to the species Diclonius mirabilis. This species name was created by combining Diclonius, a hadrosaurid genus Cope had named earlier from teeth, with Trachodon mirabilis, an older name based on teeth and published by Joseph Leidy. Cope believed that Leidy had failed to properly characterize the genus Trachodon and later abandoned its use, so he assigned the old species to his newer genus. Leidy had come to recognize that his Trachodon was based on the remains of multiple kinds of dinosaurs, and though he had made some attempts to revise the genus, he had not yet made any formal declaration of his intentions. Cope's description promoted hadrosaurids as amphibious, contributing to this long-time image. His reasoning was that the teeth of the lower jaw were weakly connected to the bone and liable to break off if used to consume terrestrial food, and he described the beak as weak as well. However, aside from misidentifying several of the skull bones, by chance the lower jaws were missing the walls supporting the teeth from the inside; the teeth were actually well-supported.Lull and Wright, Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America, pp. 43. Cope intended to describe the skeleton as well as the skull, but his promised paper never appeared. It was purchased for the American Museum of Natural History in 1899, where it acquired its present designation AMNH 5730. Outdated 1909 life restoration of Trachodon by Charles R. Knight, based on the two specimens (now classified as E. annectens) mounted in 1908 at the AMNH, New York. Several years after Cope's description, his rival Othniel Charles Marsh published on a sizable lower jaw recovered by John Bell Hatcher in 1889 from Lance Formation rocks in Niobrara County, Wyoming. Marsh named this partial jaw Trachodon longiceps. It is cataloged as YPM 616\\\\. As noted by Lull and Wright, this long slender partial jaw shares with Cope's specimen a prominent ridge running on its side. However, it is much larger: Cope's specimen had a dentary, or tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw, that is long, whereas Marsh's dentary is estimated at long. A second mostly complete skeleton (AMNH 5886) was found in 1904 in Hell Creek Formation rocks at Crooked Creek in central Montana by Oscar Hunter, a rancher. Upon finding the partially exposed specimen, he and a companion argued about whether or not the remains were recent or fossil. Hunter demonstrated that they were brittle and thus stone by kicking the tops off the vertebrae, an act later lamented by the eventual collector Barnum Brown. Another cowboy, Alfred Sensiba, bought the specimen from Hunter for a pistol, and later sold it to Brown, who excavated it for the American Museum of Natural History in 1906. This specimen had a nearly complete vertebral column, permitting the restoration of Cope's specimen. In 1908, these two specimens were mounted side-by-side in the American Museum of Natural History, under the name Trachodon mirabilis. Cope's specimen is positioned on all fours with its head down, as if feeding, because it has the better skull, while Brown's specimen, with a less perfect skull, is posed bipedally with the head less accessible. Henry Fairfield Osborn described the tableau as representing the two animals feeding along a marsh, the standing individual having been startled by the approach of a Tyrannosaurus. Impressions of appropriate plant remains and shells based on associated fossils were included on the base of the group, including ginkgo leaves, Sequoia cones, and horsetail rushes. Marsh's Claosaurus annectens Skeletal restoration of the E. annectens (then Claosaurus) holotype, by Othniel Charles Marsh. E. annectens paratype YPM 2182 at the Yale University Museum, the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton mounted in the United States. The species now known as Edmontosaurus annectens was named in 1892 as Claosaurus annectens by Othniel Charles Marsh. This species is based on USNM 2414, a partial skull-roof and skeleton, with a second skull and skeleton, YPM 2182, designated the paratype. Both were collected in 1891 by John Bell Hatcher from the late Maastrichtian-age Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation of Niobrara County (then part of Converse County), Wyoming. This species has some historical footnotes attached: it is among the first dinosaurs to receive a skeletal restoration, and is the first hadrosaurid so restored; and YPM 2182 and UNSM 2414 are, respectively, the first and second essentially complete mounted dinosaur skeletons in the United States. YPM 2182 was put on display in 1901, and USNM 2414 in 1904. In the first decade of the twentieth century, two additional important specimens of C. annectens were recovered. The first, the \\"Trachodon mummy\\" (AMNH 5060), was discovered in 1908 by Charles Hazelius Sternberg and his sons in Lance Formation rocks near Lusk, Wyoming. Sternberg was working for the British Museum of Natural History, but Henry Fairfield Osborn of the American Museum of Natural History was able to purchase the specimen for $2,000. The Sternbergs recovered a second similar specimen from the same area in 1910, not as well-preserved but also found with skin impressions. They sold this specimen (SM 4036) to the Senckenberg Museum in Germany. Canadian discoveries Edmontosaurus itself was coined in 1917 by Lawrence Lambe for two partial skeletons found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (formerly the lower Edmonton Formation) along the Red Deer River of southern Alberta, Canada. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is older than the rocks in which Claosaurus annectens was found. Lambe found that his new dinosaur compared best to Cope's Diclonius mirabilis. In 1926, Charles Mortram Sternberg named Thespesius saskatchewanensis for NMC 8509, a skull and partial skeleton from the Wood Mountain plateau of southern Saskatchewan. He had collected this specimen in 1921, from rocks that were assigned to the Lance Formation, now the Frenchman Formation. NMC 8509 included an almost complete skull, numerous vertebrae, partial shoulder and hip girdles, and partial hind limbs, representing the first substantial dinosaur specimen recovered from Saskatchewan. Sternberg opted to assign it to Thespesius because that was the only hadrosaurid genus known from the Lance Formation at the time. At the time, T. saskatchewanensis was unusual because of its small size, estimated at in length. Early classifications Because of the incomplete understanding of hadrosaurids at the time, following Marsh's death in 1897 Claosaurus annectens was variously classified as a species of Claosaurus, Thespesius or Trachodon. Opinions varied greatly; textbooks and encyclopedias drew a distinction between the \\"Iguanodon-like\\" Claosaurus annectens and the \\"duck-billed\\" Hadrosaurus (based on Cope's Diclonius mirabilis), while Hatcher explicitly identified C. annectens as synonymous with the hadrosaurid represented by those same duck-billed skulls, the two differentiated only by individual variation or distortion from pressure. Hatcher's revision, published in 1902, was sweeping: he considered almost all hadrosaurid genera then known as synonyms of Trachodon. This included Cionodon, Diclonius, Hadrosaurus, Ornithotarsus, Pteropelyx, and Thespesius, as well as Claorhynchus and Polyonax, fragmentary genera now thought to be horned dinosaurs. Hatcher's work led to a brief consensus until about 1910, when new material from Canada and Montana showed a greater diversity of hadrosaurids than previously suspected. Charles W. Gilmore in 1915 reassessed hadrosaurids and recommended that Thespesius be reintroduced for hadrosaurids from the Lance Formation and rock units of equivalent age, and that Trachodon, based on inadequate material, should be restricted to a hadrosaurid from the older Judith River Formation and its equivalents. In regards to Claosaurus annectens, he recommended that it be considered the same as Thespesius occidentalis. A multiplicity of names resumed, with the American Museum duckbills being known as Diclonius mirabilis, Trachodon mirabilis, Trachodon annectens, Claosaurus, or Thespesius. Anatosaurus to the present AMNH 5060: a well-preserved specimen of E. annectens This confusing situation was temporarily resolved in 1942 by Richard Swann Lull and Nelda Wright. In their monograph on hadrosaurian dinosaurs of North America, they opted to settle the questions revolving around the American Museum duckbills, Marsh's Claosaurus annectens, and several other species by creating a new generic name. They created the new genus Anatosaurus (\\"duck lizard\\", because of its wide, duck- like beak; Latin anas = duck + Greek sauros = lizard) and made Marsh's species the type species, calling it Anatosaurus annectens. To this genus, they also assigned Marsh's Trachodon longiceps, a pair of species that had been assigned to Thespesius under Gilmore's \\"Lance Formation hadrosaurid\\" conception (T. edmontoni from Gilmore in 1924 and T. saskatchewanensis), and Cope's Diclonius mirabilis.Lull and Wright, Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America, pp. 154‚Äì164. Lull and Wright decided to remove the American Museum specimens from Diclonius (or Trachodon) because they found no convincing reason to assign the specimens to either. Because this left the skeletons without a species name, Lull and Wright gave them their own species, Anatosaurus copei, in honor of Cope. Cope's original specimen (AMNH 5730) was made the holotype of the species, with Brown's (AMNH 5886) as the plesiotype. Anatosaurus would come to be called the \\"classic duck-billed dinosaur.\\" This state of affairs persisted for several decades, until Michael K. Brett-Surman reexamined the pertinent material for his graduate studies in the 1970s and 1980s. He concluded that the type species of Anatosaurus, A. annectens, was actually a species of Edmontosaurus, and that A. copei was different enough to warrant its own genus. Although theses and dissertations are not regarded as official publications by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, which regulates the naming of organisms, his conclusions were known to other paleontologists, and were adopted by several popular works of the time. His replacement name, Anatotitan (Latin anas (\\"duck\\") and the Greek Titan, meaning large), was known and published as such in the popular literature by 1990. Formal publication of the name Anatotitan copei took place the same year, in an article co-written by Brett-Surman with Ralph Chapman (although the name is sometimes credited as Brett-Surman vide Chapman and Brett-Surman because it came out of Brett-Surman's work). Because the type species of Anatosaurus (A. annectens) was sunk into Edmontosaurus, the name Anatosaurus is abandoned as a junior synonym of Edmontosaurus. Skin impression of the specimen nicknamed \\"Dakota\\", which was found in 1999 Of the remaining species of Anatosaurus, A. saskatchewanensis and A. edmontoni were assigned to Edmontosaurus as well, and A. longiceps went to Anatotitan, as either a second species or as a synonym of A. copei. A. longiceps may be a synonym of E. annectens, though it has also been treated as a nomen dubium by some.Lund, E. & Gates, T. (2006). \\"A historical and biogeographical examination of hadrosaurian dinosaurs.\\" Pp. 263-276 in Lucas, S.G. and Sullivan, R.M. (eds.), Late Cretaceous vertebrates from the Western Interior. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 35. The conception of Edmontosaurus that emerged included three valid species: the type E. regalis, E. annectens (including Anatosaurus edmontoni, emended to edmontonensis), and E. saskatchewanensis. The debate about the proper taxonomy of the A. copei specimens continues to the present: returning to Hatcher's argument of 1902, Jack Horner, David B. Weishampel, and Catherine Forster regarded Anatotitan copei as representing specimens of Edmontosaurus annectens with crushed skulls. In 2007 another \\"mummy\\" was announced; nicknamed \\"Dakota\\", it was discovered in 1999 by Tyler Lyson, and came from the Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota. In a 2011 study by Nicol√°s Campione and David Evans, the authors conducted the first-ever morphometric analysis of the various specimens assigned to Edmontosaurus. They concluded that only two species are valid: E. regalis, from the late Campanian, and E. annectens, from the late Maastrichtian. Their study provided further evidence that Anatotitan copei is a synonym of E. annectens; specifically, that the long, low skull of A. copei is the result of ontogenetic change and represents mature E. annectens individuals. E. saskatechwanensis represents young E. annectens, and Anatosaurus edmontoni specimens belong to E. regalis, not E. annectens. The reassessment of Edmontosaurus assigns twenty skulls to E. annectens. Adult skulls can be distinguished from skulls of E. regalis by the elongate snout and other details of skull anatomy. Description Scale diagram comparing large adult specimens of E. regalis (gray) and E. annectens (green) to a human The skull and skeleton of E. annectens are well-known. Edward Drinker Cope estimated the length of one specimen as about long, with a skull long. This body length estimate was later revised down to a length of , although to be fair to Cope a dozen vertebrae, the hips, and thigh bones had been carried away by a stream cutting through the skeleton, and the tip of the tail was incomplete. A second skeleton currently exhibited next to Cope's specimen, but in a standing posture, is estimated at long, with its head above the ground. The hip height of this specimen is estimated as approximately . Other sources have estimated the length of E. annectens as approximately . Most specimens are somewhat shorter, representing individuals that are not fully grown. Two well-known mounted skeletons, USNM 2414 and YPM 2182, measure long and long, respectively. E. annectens may have weighed about 6.6 metric tons (7.3 tons) when fully grown. Recently-found specimens that are still under study at the Museum of the Rockies, namely MOR 1142 (\\"X-rex\\") and MOR 1609 (\\"Becky's Giant\\"), suggest that E. annectens may have reached lengths of over and massed over 10 tons, potentially making it one of the largest hadrosaurids. Life restoration The skull of E. annectens is known for its long, wide muzzle. Cope compared this feature to that of a goose in side view, and to a short-billed spoonbill in top view. The skull was longer and lower proportionally than in any other known hadrosaurid. The toothless portion of the anterior mandible was relatively longer than in any hadrosaur. The extreme length and breadth did not appear until an individual reached maturity, so many specimens lack the distinctive shape. The bones surrounding the large openings for the nostrils formed deep pockets around the openings. The eye sockets were rectangular and longer front to back than top to bottom, although this may have been exaggerated by postmortem crushing. The skull roof was flat and lacked a bony crest, and the quadrate bone that formed the articulation with the lower jaw was distinctly curved. The lower jaw was long and straight, lacking the downward curve seen in other hadrosaurids, and possessing a heavy ridge running its length. The predentary was wide and shovel-like.Lull and Wright, Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America, pp. 157-159. The ridge on the lower jaw may have reinforced the long, slender structure.Lull and Wright, Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America, pp. 163-164. As mounted, the vertebral column of E. annectens includes twelve neck, twelve back, nine sacral, and at least thirty tail vertebrae. The limb bones were longer and more lightly built than those of other hadrosaurids of comparable size. E. annectens had a distinctive pelvis, based on the proportions and form of the pubis bone. E. annectens, like other hadrosaurids, could move both on two legs and on four legs. It probably preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. Henry Fairfield Osborn used the skeletons in the American Museum of Natural History to portray both quadrupedal and bipedal stances for E. annectens. Classification E. annectens holotype, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Most known complete Edmontosaurus skulls (E. annectens from lower middle to right) E. annectens was a saurolophine or \\"flat-headed\\" hadrosaurid; this group was historically known as Hadrosaurinae. Species now considered to be synonyms of Edmontosaurus annectens were long recognized as closely related to both the genus and the species. However, the skull of the sub-adult type specimen of E. annectens differs noticeably from fully mature remains, so many researchers had classified the two growth stages as different species or even genera. On the other side of the issue, other authors, from John Bell Hatcher in 1902, to Jack Horner, David B. Weishampel, and Catherine Forster in 2004, and most recently Nicol√°s Campione and David Evans, have proposed that the large, flat-headed specimens most recently classified as Anatotitan copei belong to E. annectens. E. annectens was also historically classified in an independent genus, Anatosaurus, following the influential 1942 revision of Hadrosauridae by Richard Swann Lull and Nelda Wright, until it was reclassified as a species of Edmontosaurus by Michael K. Brett-Surman. With the discovery that A. copei and E. annectens likely represent the same species, some paleontologists have proposed using Anatosaurus as a valid genus name for E. annectens. The cladogram below follows Godefroit et al. (2012) analysis. Paleobiology Close up of teeth As hadrosaurids, individuals of Edmontosaurus annectens would have been large herbivores, eating plants with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing. Their teeth were continually replaced and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. Plant material would have been cropped by the broad beak, and held in the jaws by a cheek-like structure. Feeding would have been from the ground up to around 4 meters (13 ft) above. Like other hadrosaurs, they could have moved both bipedally and quadrupedally. The extensive depressions surrounding its nasal openings may have hosted nasal diverticula. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals. A preserved rhamphotheca present in specimen LACM 23502, housed in the Los Angeles County Museum, also indicates the beak of Edmontosaurus was more hook-shaped and extensive than many illustrations in scientific and public media have previously depicted. Growth Mounted skeletons of a juvenile and adult E. annectens In a 2011 study, Campione and Evans recorded data from all known \\"edmontosaur\\" skulls from the Campanian and Maastrichtian and used it to plot a morphometric' graph, comparing variable features of the skull with skull size. Their results showed that within both recognized Edmontosaurus species, many features previously used to classify additional species or genera were directly correlated with skull size. Campione and Evans interpreted these results as strongly suggesting that the shape of Edmontosaurus skulls changed dramatically as they grew. This has led to several apparent mistakes in classification in the past. The three previously recognized Maastrichtian edmontosaur species likely represent growth stages of a single species, with E. saskatchewanensis representing juveniles, E. annectens subadults, and Anatotitan copei fully mature adults. The skulls became longer and flatter as the animals grew. Paleoecology The damage to the tail vertebrae of this E. annectens skeleton (on display at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science) indicates that it may have been bitten by a Tyrannosaurus. True E. annectens remains are known only from latest Maastrichtian-age rocks of the Hell Creek and Lance Formations from South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming, USA and the Frenchman Formation of Saskatchewan, Canada. The Lancian time interval was the last interval before the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event that eliminated non-avian dinosaurs. Edmontosaurus was one of the more common dinosaurs of the interval. Robert Bakker reports that it made up one-seventh of the large dinosaur sample, with most of the rest (five-sixths) made up of the horned dinosaur Triceratops.Bakker, Robert T. (1986). The Dinosaur Heresies. p. 438. The coastal plain Triceratops‚ÄìEdmontosaurus association, dominated by Triceratops, extended from Colorado to Saskatchewan. Typical dinosaur faunas of the Lancian formations where Edmontosaurus annectens has been found also included the hypsilophodont Thescelosaurus, the rare ceratopsid Torosaurus, the pachycephalosaurid Pachycephalosaurus, the ankylosaurid Ankylosaurus, and the theropods Ornithomimus, Pectinodon, Acheroraptor, Dakotaraptor, and Tyrannosaurus. The Hell Creek Formation is well exposed in the badlands in the vicinity of Fort Peck Reservoir. The Hell Creek Formation, as typified by exposures in the Fort Peck area of Montana, has been interpreted as a flat forested floodplain, with a relatively dry subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees, to conifers such as bald cypress, to ferns and ginkgos. The coastline was hundreds of kilometers or miles to the east. Stream-dwelling turtles and tree-dwelling multituberculate mammals were diverse, and monitor lizards as large as the modern Komodo dragon hunted on the ground. Triceratops was the most abundant large dinosaur, and Thescelosaurus the most abundant small herbivorous dinosaur. Edmontosaur remains have been collected here from stream channel sands, and include fossils from individuals as young as a meter- or yard-long infant. The edmontosaur fossils probably represent accumulations from groups on the move.Russell, Dale A. (1989). An Odyssey in Time: Dinosaurs of North America. pp. 175‚Äì180. The Lance Formation, as typified by exposures approximately north of Fort Laramie in eastern Wyoming, has been interpreted as a bayou setting similar to the Louisiana coastal plain. It was closer to a large delta than the Hell Creek Formation depositional setting to the north and received much more sediment. Tropical araucarian conifers and palm trees dotted the hardwood forests, differentiating the flora from the northern coastal plain.Russell, Dale A. (1989). An Odyssey in Time: Dinosaurs of North America. pp. 180‚Äì181. The climate was humid and subtropical, with conifers, palmettos, and ferns in the swamps, and conifers, ash, live oak, and shrubs in the forests. Freshwater fish, salamanders, turtles, diverse lizards, snakes, shorebirds, and small mammals lived alongside the dinosaurs. Small dinosaurs are not known in as great of abundance here as in the Hell Creek rocks, but Thescelosaurus once again seems to have been relatively common. Triceratops is known from many skulls, which tend to be somewhat smaller than those of more northern individuals. The Lance Formation is the setting of two edmontosaur \\"mummies\\". See also * Timeline of hadrosaur research Notes Many of the original references deal with specimens or species that were not assigned to E. annectens until later. This is particularly true with the specimens long known, chronologically, as Diclonius mirabilis, Anatosaurus copei, and Anatotitan copei. This toothless section is also known as a diastema.

Born in Newcastle, McGowan was educated in country New South Wales before attending the University of Queensland. He subsequently worked as a legal officer for the Royal Australian Navy, serving at naval base , south of Perth. Remaining in Western Australia, McGowan served as a councillor at the City of Rockingham from 1994 until his election to the Legislative Assembly at the 1996 state election, representing the seat of Rockingham. After the 2005 election, he was elevated to the ministry, although he had served as a parliamentary secretary since the 2001 election. McGowan became leader of the Labor Party and opposition leader following Eric Ripper's resignation in January 2012, and led the party at its 2013 election defeat. While in opposition, McGowan held several shadow portfolios in addition to his role as opposition leader. McGowan led Labor to a landslide win at the 2017 election, and was sworn in by Governor Kerry Sanderson on 17 March 2017 as the 30th premier of Western Australia. Early life and naval career McGowan was born into a family of Irish descent in Newcastle, New South Wales and was educated at public schools in Coffs Harbour, before obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1987 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1989 from the University of Queensland. He joined the Australian Labor Party in 1984. In 1989, he joined the Australian Navy and served at the naval base . In 1996, he was awarded a Commendation for Brave Conduct, for actions he took as a naval officer in 1995 in rescuing an unconscious driver from a burning car. Political career In 1994, he was elected to the City of Rockingham as a councillor, and in 1995, he became deputy mayor. He was preselected to run for the seat of Rockingham at the 1996 state election following the retirement of long-serving MP Mike Barnett. At the 2001 election, Labor defeated the previous Liberal‚ÄìNational government, and McGowan was appointed parliamentary secretary to the premier. He also chaired the ANZAC Committee, the committee managing the State's 175th anniversary celebrations in 2004 and the Bali Memorial Steering Committee. In January 2005, following the retirement of federal Labor leader Mark Latham, McGowan was criticised for not telling Premier Geoff Gallop before taking leave to travel to Sydney with Kim Beazley, who was seeking the position. Gallop ordered him to return to Perth. Following Labor's win at the 2005 election, Gallop reshuffled the ministry, giving McGowan the Tourism portfolio as well as Racing and Gaming, Youth, and Peel and the South West. In February, following Gallop's retirement, McGowan became the Environment Minister while retaining Racing and Gaming but losing all others‚Äînotably Tourism to Sheila McHale, Youth to David Templeman and South West to Norm Marlborough. McGowan introduced major liquor reforms including the introduction of small bars, created the Department of Environment and Conservation and provided approval for the Gorgon Project. On 13 December 2006, following Marlborough's departure from the Carpenter ministry and Ljiljanna Ravlich's troubled run in the Education portfolio, McGowan became Minister for Education and Training and for the South West. In the Education portfolio, he oversaw the replacement of outcomes-based education with syllabus (scope and sequence) documents, re- established traditional forms of marking and reporting and launched a renewed effort towards the attraction and retention of teachers. In April 2008 McGowan came under fire when he referred to an ex-Labor MP John D'Orazio as \\"the worst ethnic branch stacker in the history of Labor in WA\\". McGowan later apologised to anyone who took offence to the remark. McGowan was again in the media spotlight after it was revealed that he had dealings with Brian Burke during the 2005 state election. A copy of an email showed that he had consulted with Burke over fundraising. Following the defeat of the Labor Party at the 2008 state election and Carpenter's resignation as leader of the Labor Party, McGowan was one of several contenders to replace him. Ultimately, he did not contest, and Eric Ripper was elected unopposed; however, McGowan contested the deputy role, which he lost to newcomer Roger Cook in a 30‚Äì9 vote. McGowan was awarded a place in the shadow ministry as shadow minister for State Development, Trade, Planning, Housing and Works and also managed opposition business in the Legislative Assembly. Labor leader McGowan speaking at a rally in 2014. On 17 January 2012, Eric Ripper announced his resignation as state Labor leader. At a caucus meeting on 23 January, McGowan was elected unopposed as Ripper's successor. McGowan led Labor into the 2013 state election. Labor suffered a 5.4 percent two-party swing and a loss of five seats, including that of former leader Ripper. McGowan was not blamed for the loss, and stayed on as opposition leader. Polling Polling since the 2013 state election landslide consistently showed a large swing away from the second-term Barnett Liberal government, with the Newspoll conducted from October to December 2015 and released in January 2016, revealing that the government trailed the Labor opposition significantly, at 47‚Äì53 two-party‚Äîa double-digit two-party swing of more than 10 points since the 2013 election, with Labor's 33 percent primary vote increasing to a current 42 percent. Just prior to the 2013 election, Barnett was nominated Better Premier with a 21-point lead on 52 percent, with an approval rating of 51 percent and a disapproval rating of 36 percent. Since then, McGowan consistently led Barnett as Better Premier by several percentage points, with Barnett's approval rating consistently low. Premier At the 2017 state election, McGowan led WA Labor to one of the most comprehensive victories on record at the state or territory level since Federation. Labor went on to win 41 of the 59 seats available on 55.5 percent of the two-party vote and a 20-seat swing, unseating six members of Barnett's cabinet, including Nationals leader Brendon Grylls. Labor also unseated a seventh minister, who sat in the Legislative Council. Not only was this WA Labor's strongest performance ever in terms of both seat count and percentage of seats controlled, but it is the largest majority government in Western Australian history. McGowan's victory was due in large part to a massive swing in Perth. Labor had gone into the election holding 17 of the capital's 43 seats. However, according to the ABC's Antony Green, many of the Liberals in Perth's outer suburbs sat on inflated margins. Green concluded that for that reason, the 10-point swing Labor needed to make McGowan Premier was not as daunting as it appeared. Many of those seats fell to Labor on swings of over 10 points; overall, Labor took 34 seats in Perth on a 13.6-point swing. He was sworn in by the Governor and became the 30th premier of Western Australia on 17 March 2017. Early in his premiership, McGowan promptly moved to limit the number of pathways for foreign workers to enter the state and re-committed to terminating the controversial Perth Freight Link highway project. McGowan has worked to expand Chinese investment in Western Australia. In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic McGowan closed the state's borders on 15 April. In July 2020 businessman Clive Palmer claimed that the closing of the borders was unconstitutional and launched a legal challenge in the Federal Court. In response McGowan labelled Palmer an \\"enemy of the state\\". Shortly afterward McGowan's popularity increased to record highs in Western Australia. Personal life McGowan is married and has three children.

Name The name of the genus giving the family its name refers to the river Ogoou√©, where the type species was found. The genus was originally named Ogovia Hansen & S√∏rensen, 1904, but later renamed Ogovea Roewer, 1923,Pinto-da-Rocha, Ricardo; Machado, Glauco; Giribet, Gonzalo (2007). Harvestmen: The Biology of Opiliones. Harvard University Press. . as the original name already belonged to a genus of Noctuid moths. Description Ogoveidae are moderately sized Cyphophthalmi, at 3.4 to 5 mm long, and dark reddish-brown in color as adults. Like most members of the Sternophthalmi, they are completely eyeless, exhibit opisthosomal exocrine glands located on the sternum, and possess a complete corona analis (fusion of sternites 8 & 9, and tergite 9), as well as laterally projecting ozophores. Their body is covered with distinct granulations, as well as a variety of different types of sensory hairs and structures, including a solea (modified area with a high concentration of sensory setae) on the first pair of tarsi. The chelicerae exhibit a smooth, robust, second segment, as well as a dorsal crest, small ventral process, and large, uniform, nodular teeth. They can be distinguished from other families of Sternophthalmi by the smooth tarsal claws on the second tarsi, as well as a conspicuous opisthosomal median furrow, more distinct than that of some Neogoveids, and a short, thornlike, triangular adenostyle. Synapomorphies Ogoveidae also possesses several unique apomorphies, including a conspicuous, posteriorly projecting apophysis associated with the sternal exocrine glands, a conspicuous, anteriorly projecting tricuspidate process located along the front of the prosomal carapace, a modified, compressed pedipalpal femur that allows the pedipalps to fold over the chelicerae, and unique structures known as Hansen's organs. Hansen's organs appear as circular, raised, smooth patches of cuticle, and can be found on the legs, coxae and the underside of the opisthosoma. The exact function of the Hansen's organ is currently unknown, although they are thought to be associated with some sensory function. Spermatopositor Ogoveids possess a characteristic spermatopositor, with a uniquely complex setation pattern, consisting of 4-5 rows of short setae on the ventral plate, and 4 short setae in a single row located apically on the median plate. The dorsal setae are long, and form 2 groups. Distribution Ogoveidae is very geographically conserved, found only in tropical rain forests of equatorial West Africa. So far, it is known from 3 different nations: Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and, likely, Gabon. All 3 species are known only from their type locality, and it is possible the range of the family extends considerably further than is known. Relationships Ogoveidae was erected as a family in 1980, originally consisting of 2 genera, Ogovea and Huitaca, though in 2003 Huitaca was transferred to the related family Neogoveidae. These 2 families make up the superfamily Ogoveoidea, which is the sister group to Troglosironidae. Troglosironidae and Ogoveoidea together make up the infraorder Sternophthalmi, which is well supported as monophyletic by recent phylogenetic analyses. However, no cladistic analysis has been conducted to resolve the internal phylogeny of the family. Species Ogovea cameroonensis Giribet & Prieto, 2003 This species was discovered near Yaound√©, in Cameroon, considerably extending the range of the genus northwards. It is known from 19 specimens, all collected at the same locality. This is the largest of the three species by a wide margin, reaching up to 5 mm in length, and is most apparently similar to O. grossa. It can be distinguished from that species on the basis of its large size, significantly shorter anterior process, and proportionally longer chelicerae, which also exhibit a much more conspicuous dorsal crest. Ogovea grossa Hansen & William S√∏rensen, 1904 Original illustration of Ogovea grossa The first species of the genus to be discovered, it is known only from a single female specimen collected along the Ogoou√© River in what was then French Equatorial Africa. However, as the Ogoou√© River flows through both the modern day nations of Congo and Gabon, it is unknown in which modern nation the specimen was found. The specimen was identified as a separate genus on the basis of the anteriorly projecting process on the prosoma and compressed pedipalps; compared to the other 2 species in the genus, O. grossa is intermediate in terms of body length and the length of the anterior process. The single known specimen was 3.75 mm in length. Ogovea nasuta Hansen, 1921 The original illustration of the dorsum of the prosoma (1a) and the venter (1b) of Ogovea nasuta. Lines indicate Hansen's organs. This species is based on 5 specimens collected on the island of Bioko, in Equatorial Guinea, between the altitudes of 400 and 500 meters. Of the 5 specimens, 3 were adult males, allowing for the examination of sexually dimorphic characters in the family for the first time, including the characteristic ventral posterior apophysis of the male. Of the other 2, 1 was an adult female, and 1 was an immature. This species was distinguished from O. grossa primarily due to the significantly longer and broader anterior process, significantly shorter legs, proportionally longer solea, and a different granulation pattern. This species is also the smallest of the known species of Ogovea, with the single female specimen being 3.52 mm in length and the males being slightly smaller than that.

Gleiszellen's first mention in a historical document dates to 1136, whereas Gleishorbach first appeared in a historical record in 1304. Both sit at the bottom of a small mountain called the Hatzelberg, which overlooks the Rhine valley; Gleiszellen now also occupies a good portion of the slopes of the Hatzelberg, having expanded into what were once fields and vineyards. Gleiszellen and Gleishorbach boast picturesque streets at their centers, with many old timberframe houses.

In common usage the term is taken to specifically exclude fully or partially complete vehicles, although componentry may be termed automobilia if its ownership is primarily for memento value rather than for practical use. Artifacts included within automobilia may be highly varied in nature, ranging from those linked with motoring in a general sense (e.g. an in-car tool kit) to those intrinsically linked with a specific vehicle or event (e.g. the steering wheel from a particular Formula One car, used during a notable Grand Prix race). Many people around the world are collectors of automobilia, and most autojumble sale events have a sizeable number of automobilia traders. In addition, at the upper end of the market, major auction houses such as Bonhams regularly hold specialist automobilia sales. Most collectors limit themselves to an isolated area of automobilia, commonly linked by a unifying theme. Examples of popular automobilia collection themes could include items connected to an individual, such as a motor racing driver, or objects of a specific type, such as radiator mascots. Art, models, books, toys, flags and clothing, while not directly linked with a vehicle, may also be termed automobilia if they have a motoring theme.

Synopsis A young girl, Amy Tolliver (Mae Whitman), is visiting her grandmother's cabin in a forested mountain area of Maine. Amy has developed a degenerative eye disease that has made her completely blind, and she is trying to cope with her recent handicap. When her boyfriend, David (Matthew Smalley), leaves for supplies, she is left alone.

However, Roy shoots the police officer and Amy is in peril once more when Roy cannot escape in the police car. One of the other convicts, Jared arrives just after Amy tricks Roy into going into the log store and locks him in, and takes her back into the house, pretending to be a police officer. Meanwhile, Amy's boyfriend is making his way to the cabin, having had to leave his car because of a fallen tree, and the police aren't far behind. The police discover that the two convicts who are still roaming around are brothers, in prison for armed robbery and murder. Amy almost manages to convince Jared that Roy has moved on, until Roy fires a gun at the lock on the store, alerting Jared, who was about to drive off. Amy also hears the gunshots, and tries to escape, but the brothers catch her. She tries to play them off against each other, telling Jared that Roy was going to leave without him, but it doesn't work. David arrives at the cabin just as the brothers are about to shoot her. David shuts the electricity off and Roy misses the shot, saving Amy's life. The brothers try to find Amy, realising that they haven't killed her, but while they can't see her, Amy uses her other senses to navigate, evading them. Amy hits Jared with a fire poker, knocking him out, while David tries to attack Roy. Roy catches him and holds him at gunpoint, telling Amy to come out or he'll kill David. He shoots David in the leg and knocks him unconscious. Amy picks up Jared's gun, and the two try to navigate in the darkness and find the other. Roy accidentally shoots Jared, thinking that he's Amy, and Jared dies in his arms. Amy hides upstairs and Roy angrily pursues her, as the police arrive. Amy loads Jared's gun with bullets just as Roy climbs the stairs, and shoots him in the chest just as he prepares to shoot her. However, it isn't fatal, and Roy tries to shoot her again, but the Sheriff shoots him from downstairs. Amy rides off in the ambulance with David.

Brill Online. http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/uid=1415/entry?entry=islam_COM-0658&authstatuscode;=202 Due to the open war between Hulagu and his cousin Berke of the Golden Horde during the civil war of the Mongol Empire, the Ilkhanate could only afford to send 6,000 troops back into Syria to retake control of the lands. This expedition was initiated by Ilkhanate generals such as Baidu who was forced to leave Gaza when the Mamluks advanced just before the battle of Ain Jalut.Reuven Amitai-Preiss-Mongols and Mamluks: the Mamluk-ƒ™lkhƒÅnid War, 1260-1281, p.43 After attacking Aleppo, the force travelled southwards to Homs, but were decisively defeated. This ended the first campaign into Syria by the Ilkhanate, though there were several later incursions, none of which ended with conquests lasting more than a year.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is an Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Congleton. History The church was founded around the end of the 11th century, probably by Hugh de Mara, Lord of Lawton. There is a tradition that in the 8th century the body of St Werburgh rested overnight on the site of the church while it was being carried from Lincolnshire to Chester. In 1652 the church was struck by lightning and 11 people in the church were killed. The body of the church was destroyed by fire in 1798 and rebuilt by 1803. Following the fire of 1798 the body of the church was rebuilt in brick in neoclassical style. The cost of this was around ¬£8,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). A south porch was added as a War Memorial in 1923. Architecture Reset Norman doorway Exterior The tower at the west end, dating from the 16th century, is built of red and buff sandstone in Perpendicular style. On the south face of the tower are carved a chalice and the initials \\"I. B.\\". These initials are those of the parish priest of the time, John Bybber, or Byber. The bell openings contain Y-tracery. On each side of the church are two lunette windows, with two round-headed windows between them. At the east end of the church is a Venetian window. A Norman doorway which survived the fire has been reset in the south wall of the nave. Interior Inside the church at the west end is a gallery dated 1717 which also survived the fire. It was planned to refurbish the church in 1873 but the full refurbishment did not occur. At the time the old box pews were replaced with the present pews and a two-manual organ was installed in the gallery. Also inside the church are the royal arms of George III and six hatchments of the Lawton family. At the base of a stairway leading to the gallery is the tomb of John Byber on which are carved his initials. Displayed under the gallery are some 13th-century flooring tiles which were discovered during the 1874 restoration. There is a ring of eight bells. Five of these which are dated 1713 are by Richard Sanders; the other three are by John Taylor and Company, one of which is dated 1882 and the other two are dated 1901. The parish registers start in 1559 and the churchwardens' accounts date from 1691. External features The churchyard contains the war graves of two First World War soldiers. In the rectory garden is a font dating from the middle of the 18th century.

He was known principally for his crime and suspense novels and stories, although he wrote in other genres as well. For example, contributing short stories and poetry to The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and articles, verse, and parliamentary reports for Punch. Early life Hubbard was born in Reading, England, the second son of Wilton Hubbard, a stockbroker, and his wife Millicent, who had been born in Bombay. His grandfather, Henry Dickenson Hubbard (1824‚Äì1913), was a clergyman of the Church of England who left a substantial fortune. Hubbard was brought up mostly in Guernsey in the Channel Islands, where his father had gone to improve his health, and was educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, then at Jesus College, Oxford, where in 1933 he won the Newdigate Prize for poetry with a poem called \\"Ovid among the Goths\\".Philip Maitland Hubbard, Ovid among the Goths: the Newdigate prize poem, 1933 (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1933, 15 pages): title at books.google.co.uk Life On 3 October 1934, by Open Competition, Hubbard joined the Indian Civil ServiceThe London Gazette, Issue 34103 dated 9 November 1934, p. 7162 and went on to become the last District Commissioner of the Punjab before Indian independence in 1947. After that, he worked for the British Council and then as Deputy Director of the National Union of Manufacturers. From 1960 until his death he worked as a freelance writer. Apart from novels, he also wrote articles for Punch and light verse. On 7 October 1937, Hubbard married Eleanor Onyx Slingsby Todd at the Church of St James, Delhi. After returning to England, he and his wife settled at Horsehill Cottage, Stoke Abbott, near Beaminster, Dorset, where they lived with their three children, Jane, Caroline and Peter. Some years later he separated from his wife, and in 1973 he moved to south-west Scotland. P. M. Hubbard's main output was sixteen full-length novels for adults. These are typically suspense stories which have their settings in the countryside or on the coast of England or Scotland, although one, The Country of Again, is set mainly in Pakistan. Most of the novels feature a male protagonist (although in some, such as Flush as May and The Quiet River, the protagonist is a woman) and characters who in general are educated, articulate, and strong-willed. They draw extensively on one or more of the author's interests and preoccupations, including country sports, small-boat sailing, folk religion, and the works of William Shakespeare. Hubbard's novel High Tide was adapted for television and broadcast in 1980 as part of the British ITV network's \\"Armchair Thriller\\" series. Hubbard was described in his obituary in The Times as a \\"most imaginative and distinguished practitioner\\", writing with an \\"assurance and individuality of style and tone.\\" He died on 17 March 1980 in Newton Stewart, Galloway.

Colombia's average annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and Vietnam, though highest in terms of the arabica bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region. In 2007, the European Union granted Colombian coffee a protected designation of origin status. In 2011, UNESCO declared the \\"Coffee Cultural Landscape\\" of Colombia, a World Heritage site. The coffee plant had spread to Colombia by 1790. The oldest written testimony of the presence of coffee in Colombia is attributed to a Jesuit priest, Jos√© Gumilla. In his book The Orinoco Illustrated (1730), he registered the presence of coffee in the mission of Saint Teresa of Tabaj√©, near where the Meta river empties into the Orinoco. Further testimony comes from the archbishop-viceroy Caballero y Gongora (1787) who registered the presence of the crop in the north east of the country near Giron (Santander) and Muzo (Boyaca) in a report that he provided to the Spanish authorities. Early cultivation The first coffee crops were planted in the eastern part of the country. In 1808 the first commercial production was registered with 100 green coffee bags (60 kg each) that were exported from the port of Cucuta, near the border with Venezuela. A priest named Francisco Romero is attributed to have been very influential in the propagation of the crop in the northeast region of the country. After hearing the confession of the parishioners of the town of Salazar de la Palmas, he required as penance the cultivation of coffee. Coffee became established in the departments of Santander and North Santander, Cundinamarca, Antioquia, and the historic region of Caldas. Exportation Despite these early developments, the consolidation of coffee as a Colombian export did not come about until the second half of the 19th century. The great expansion that the world economy underwent at that time allowed Colombian landowners to find attractive opportunities in international markets. Little by little, the United States became the most important consumer of coffee in the world, while (Germany) and France became the most important markets in Europe. Setbacks The then large Colombian landowners had already tried to exploit the new opportunities that the expansion of the international markets offered. Between 1850 and 1857 the country experienced a significant increase in tobacco and quinine exports, and thereafter leather and live cattle. These early efforts in the export of agricultural commodities turned out too fragile; they in fact were only reactionary attempts to find the greatest profitability from the high international prices of the time, rather than attempts to create a solid and diversified export platform. The production of these sectors went into a period of decline when the respective bonanza of their international prices terminated, hence a true industrial consolidation was prevented. With the fall of international prices, that registered the transition from the 19th to the 20th century, the profitability of the large estates plummeted. As if this was not enough, the Thousand Days War, which took place during the first years of the new century, also negatively influenced the important landowners, making it impossible for them to maintain their plantations in good conditions; this circumstance summed to the fact that these producers had incurred in large amounts of foreign debt in order to further develop their plantations, which finally ruined them. The coffee estates of Santander and North Santander entered into crisis and the estates of Cundinamarca and Antioquia stalled. Consequences A coffee plantation in Quimbaya, Quind√≠o. The crisis that affected the large estates brought with it one of the most significant changes of the Colombian coffee industry. Since 1875, the number of small coffee producers had begun to grow in Santander as well as in some regions of Antioquia and in the region referred to as Viejo or Old Caldas. In the first decades of the 20th century a new model to develop coffee exports based on the rural economy had already been consolidated, supported by internal migration and the colonization of new territories in the center and western regions of the country, principally in the departments of Antioquia, Caldas, Valle, and in the northern part of Tolima. Both the expansion of this new coffee model and the crisis that affected the large estates allowed the western regions of Colombia to take the lead in the development of the coffee industry in the country. This transformation was very favorable for the owners of the small coffee estates that were entering the coffee market. The cultivation of coffee was a very attractive option for local farmers, as it offered the possibility of making permanent and intensive use of the land. Under this productive model of the traditional agriculture, based on the slash and burn method, the land remained unproductive for long periods of time. In contrast, coffee offered the possibility of having an intense agriculture, without major technical requirements and without sacrificing the cultivation of subsistence crops, thus generating the conditions for the expansion of a new coffee culture, dominated by small farms. From 1905 to 1907 to the present Although this new breed of coffee made of country farmers demonstrated a significant capacity to grow at the margin of current international prices, Colombia did not have a relatively important dynamism in the global market of this product. During the period between 1905 and 1935 the coffee industry in Colombia grew dynamically thanks to the vision and long term politics derived from the creation of the Federaci√≥n Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia (National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia) in 1927. The union of local farmers and small producers around the Federation permitted them to confront logistical and commercial difficulties that would not have been possible individually. With time and through the research made at Cenicaf√©, founded in 1938, and the Federation's agricultural Extension Service, improved cultivation systems. More efficient spatial patterns were developed that permitted the differentiation of the product and supported its quality. Currently the Land of Coffee in Colombia includes all of the mountain ranges and other mountainous regions of the country, and generates income for over 500,000 coffee farming families. Climate change While a 2011 New York Times article claimed that regional climate change associated with global warming had caused Colombian coffee production to decline from 12 million 132-pound bags, the standard measure, to 9 million bags between 2006 - 2010, with average temperatures rising 1 degree Celsius between 1980 and 2010, and average precipitation increasing 25 percent in the preceding years, disrupting the specific climatic requirements of the Coffea arabica bean, yields of Colombia coffee increased significantly from 2011 to 2018 to 14.2 million bags. Colombian coffee growing axis The coffee growing axis (), also known as the coffee triangle () is a part of the Colombian Paisa region. There are three departments in the area: Caldas, Quind√≠o and Risaralda. These departments are among the smallest departments in Colombia with a total combined area of 13873 km¬≤ (5356 mi¬≤), about 1.2% of the Colombian territory. The combined population is 2,291,195 (2005 census). Colombian government census In 2011 UNESCO declared the region a World Heritage site.Coffee Cultural Landscape of Colombia, UNESCO, unesco.org National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia is a non-profit business association, popularly known for its \\"Juan Valdez\\" marketing campaign. The federation was founded in 1927 as a business cooperative that promotes the production and exportation of Colombian coffee. It currently represents more than 500,000 producers, most of whom are small family owned farms. The federation supports research and development in the production of coffee through grants to local universities and through federation sponsored research institutes. The federation also monitors production to ensure export quality standards are met. The Federation was founded with three objectives: 1) to protect the industry, 2) to study its problems, and 3) to further its interests.Uribe C., Andr√©s; Brown Gold, The Amazing Story of Coffee; Random House, Inc., New York, 1954, Pg 113, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 55-5793 The Juan Valdez branding concept was developed in 1981 to distinguish 100% Colombian coffee from coffee blended with beans from other countries. The trademark made its first TV appearance in 1983 featuring a country farmer carrying coffee on his mule. Juan Valdez Juan Valdez is a fictional character who has appeared in adverts for the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia since 1958, representing a Colombian coffee farmer. The adverts were designed by the Doyle Dane Bernbach ad agency, with the goal of distinguishing 100%-Colombian coffee from coffee blended with beans from other countries. He typically appears alongside his mule Conchita, carrying sacks of harvested coffee beans. He has become an icon for Colombia as well as coffee in general, and Juan Valdez's iconic appearance is frequently mimicked or parodied in television and other media. National Coffee Park A theme park based on Colombian coffee production was built in the Quind√≠o area in 1995 by the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia and the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Quind√≠o.

The television film was based on a radio play also written by Haddon. Plot David and Ben Philips are teenage brothers who live in London. Ben has Down syndrome. David resents the protective attention his parents lavish on his younger brother and how much they rely on him to look after Ben. The family move from London to Derbyshire so that Ben can attend a special school, meaning David has to leave his friends and girlfriend, Gail, behind. Ben makes friends and finds a girl friend. David has difficulty fitting into his new school, suffering at the hands of bullies. David discovers that Gail has moved on from him only five weeks after their break up, which leads him to self-harm. David decides to kill his brother. He takes Ben hitchhiking without telling his parents, and they camp in Snowdonia. Climbing the mountain, David plans to murder Ben by pushing him off a high ridge. At the top, David changes his mind, but, following taunting by Ben, pushes him in a fit of rage. Ben survives the fall relatively uninjured, but goes to hospital. David kidnaps him from hospital, but Ben stands up to him. He becomes the stronger character and, after an evening talking round the camp fire, David sees the real Ben for the first time and the brothers become reconciled. They both stand up to their parents' excessive molly coddling, so that both parents finally see Ben as a young adult, and family-life thus becomes far more relaxed and good-humoured.

Guyandot was built as Veedol II in 1930 and acquired from her owners, Tidewater Oil, in March 1943 ; converted at Brewers Drydock, Staten Island, and renamed Guyandot; and commissioned 17 April 1943, Lt. Robert R. Crockett, USNR, in command.  World War II service  Taking on a full load of fuel oil, she sailed for Bermuda on 1 May; from there she was taken in tow to Oran, where she arrived 26 May. From Oran she sailed to Bizerte, Tunisia, arriving there 8 June; although under frequent air attack Guyandot worked unceasingly shuttling oil through the wreck-laden channel. Sailing to Tunis on 27 June, Guyandot began fueling ships for the Sicilian invasion and, after the assault in late July, carried high octane fuel to the newly taken port of Palermo, again under heavy air attack.  Supporting invasion of Italy operations  Returning to Tunis 30 August, she began shuttling oil between that port and Bizerte and continued this duty until the Italian invasion was well under way. Arriving in Taranto, Italy, on 8 November, she performed yeoman work in carrying high octane aviation fuel from tankers to the shore. After a month in Palermo for drydock and overhaul, Guyandot returned to Taranto to take on gasoline and then sailed into the Adriatic for the port of Bari, arriving 8 February 1944. From Bari she shuttled oil north to Manfredonia to supply the 15th Air Force at Foggia; this work continued until late March, when she struck an underwater obstacle in Bari and, after two trips with a wooden patch, had to put in for more lasting repairs at Bizerte.  The first American ship to dock at Piraeus  Emerging from drydock 11 May, Guyandot spent a month carrying oil from Bizerte to Italy and then sailed again to Bari, arriving there 15 June 1944. From Bari she took high octane fuel to Manfredonia and Monopoli, carrying approximately 40 million gallons of gasoline for the forces moving up the Italian peninsula. An important break in her shuttle runs came from 2 November to 14 November, when she carried a load of high octane to Piraeus (Port of Athens), Greece; the British had landed in Greece only in late October and Guyandot was the first American ship to dock in Piraeus since before the outbreak of war.  Final operations  Back on the Bari-Manfredonia-Monopoli run, Guyandot continued shuttling oil until 9 December, when she sailed to Palermo for repairs and drydocking; on 7 January 1945, she crossed the Mediterranean to Bizerte.  Decommissioning  Decommissioned there 12 January, she was transferred to the French Navy as part of lend-lease. France returned the ship to the Navy on 21 March 1949 and on that same day formally purchased Guyandot for service under the name Lac Noir. Her name was struck from the Navy List 28 April 1949.

It forms in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, and is a major tributary of the Athabasca River. The McLeod River south of Hinton, Alberta __TOC__  Course  The river begins just outside the eastern border of Jasper National Park, at the confluence of Thornton and Cheviot Creeks. These creeks are fed by the meltwater on the western slopes of Tripoli and Cheviot Mountains. The McLeod River then follows the Grave Flats Road, taking on Prospect, Whitehorse, and Cadomin Creeks before emptying into Lac des Roches, south of the town of Cadomin. The river then snakes through the foothills, and is soon joined by four major tributaries, the Gregg, Erith, Embarrass, and Edson rivers before meeting the Athabasca River near the town of Whitecourt, Alberta.  Planned dam  Throughout the 1950s and the 1960s the Alberta Government undertook a number of planning studies that discussed diverting water from the Athabasca- Mackenzie watershed to the North and South Saskatchewan Rivers. In 1970, a preliminary engineering report on the McLeod Valley Dam was released by the provincial Department of Agriculture. The dam was to be located northeast of Edson, Alberta, near the hamlet of Peers, Alberta. The diverted water would have been sent via a canal to Chip Lake. The report read: :\\"The main embankment would be 5810 feet long with crest elevation at 2780 feet and a maximum height of 140 feet. Dykes, 13,230 feet long and with a maximum height of 15 feet would also be required. Two diversion tunnels, one of which will later be converted to a low level outlet, are proposed to handle river flow during the construction period. A gated ogee crest spillway has been designed with a discharge capacity sufficient to route a 1:500 year flood through the reservoir. The dam would create a reservoir approximately 12 miles long with a total storage area of at full supply level of 2770 feet.\\"Development Planning Branch, Water Resources Division, Alberta Department of Agriculture, Preliminary Engineering Report on the Investigation and Design of the McLeod Valley Dam, Edmonton: 1970.

History The team's main fighter base is made up of Russian Sambo fighters who have adapted their style to mixed martial arts, and they regularly compete in full contact combat sambo tournaments. Initially, Red Devil fighters were primarily stars of Finkelstien's MMA promotion M-1 Global such as Ibragim Magomedov, Roman Zentsov, Amar Suloev, and Arman Gambaryan. Throughout the history of M-1 global, Red Devil has competed in team events, and have proven consistently to be among Russia's best MMA teams. Since 2005 the team's most notable fighters are the brothers Fedor and Aleksander Emelianenko. The Emelianenko brothers left Russian Top Team due to claims of management abuse, and since that time the primary trainers for Red Devil have been the Emelianenkos' childhood coaches Vladimir Voronov, and Aleksander Michkov. The membership and popularity of the team has increased since Fedor and Aleksander joined as well, primarily drawing from the ranks of Russia's Combat Sambo competitors. Former champions such as Mikhail Zayats, Victor Nemkov, Aleksander Garkushenko, among others have been drawn to the club since the success of the Emelianenkos. Because of Fedor's previous association with the Russian Top Team, the two MMA associations maintained a cohabitant rivalry, until Russian Top Team was largely dissolved following the death of former manager Vladimir Pogonin, as well as the retirement of the team's former featured coach and fighter Volk Han. In 2009 Aleksander Emelianenko officially left the Red Devil for unexplained reasons, however he currently continues to train with his brothers Fedor, and Ivan, along with longtime coach Vladimir Voronin, Aleksander Michkov, and family friend Kirill Sidelnikov in Stary Oskol, Russia. The team competed in the 2008 M-1 Challenge championship (M-1 Challenge # 1) and won it. In 2009 it performed much worse failing to win its group in the M-1 Challenge 2009, where it appeared under the name Imperial Team. This is thought to be largely due to the frequency in which Red Devil enters some of its most inexperienced members into the M-1 challenge events. The team also chose the name 'Imperial Team' as its current feature fighter Fedor Emelianenko has reservations over the name 'Red Devil', and due to spiritual reasons prefers the name Imperial Team.

He gained notoriety during the FARC-Government peace process (1999-2002) acting as a negotiator. He was also known for being the associate of Brazilian drug dealer Fernandinho Beiramar and for participating in an illegal arms deal of 10,000 AK-47s for the FARC through the Peruvian government official Vladimiro Montesinos, an adviser of former president of Peru, Alberto Fujimori.

It is the oldest religious building in the town and village of Woodbury, dating to the beginning of the 19th century, and is still used by the nearby Cornwall Quakers for meetings at least once a year. While modified and renovated in the mid-19th century, its design still reflects its era of Quaker practice. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Building The meetinghouse sits in the middle of a lot, gently sloping uphill westward. The land is mostly open with several large trees, and some smaller ones that shade the meeting house. A small burial ground for early members of the meeting is located just to the north. It is a one-and-a-half-story four-by-two-bay clapboard-sided frame house supported by a fieldstone foundation. The gabled, wood-shingled roof is pierced by a central chimney. A porch runs the length of the south-facing front facade. The entrances are on either end, with an accompanying window, reflecting a contemporary Quaker practice of holding separate meetings for men and women. There are two other windows on the east and west elevations. A small privy is attached to the rear elevation. The interior consists of a sparely finished meeting room, with removable wooden partition. The walls are painted plaster, the flooring is wide wooden planks. The furniture consists of simple wooden benches and two wood-burning stoves. History The Smith Clove meeting began in 1790 as a preparative meeting under the Cornwall meeting, a few miles to the north. They met in a member's home until the need for a separate meeting house became apparent after a decade, and the land for the current meeting house was purchased in 1801. The name Smith Clove came from the original landowner of the area from the Cheesecocks Patent, William Smith, and the Dutch term kloof, for a steep, narrow valley such as the one in which Highland Mills is located, between Schunemunk Mountain and the Hudson Highlands, where Woodbury Creek flows. The members built the house themselves, it is believed, and it was complete and in use by 1803. To avoid the possible confiscation of the land, which had happened to some Quaker meetings in the area before the Revolution, several of the member families held title to the land rather than the meeting itself. In the middle of the 19th century, the meeting house was renovated. Most of the building and the original interior were kept. The clapboard siding matches the wide planks used in other Quaker meeting houses ca. 1800, but may have been replaced at this time as well. In 1886, with confiscation no longer a threat, title was passed to the meeting proper. Over time the Highland Mills meeting dwindled to the point that it merged back into the Cornwall meeting, which still meets in Smith Clove once a year.

Project Shelved In 2008, though all the pieces are in place to construct a world class racing facility, the state of the economy at that time meant the necessary funds simply were not available.  Project Progress  In November 2007, Prairie Hills received final approval for development of the Club from the Newton County Planning Commission. The Club was initially expected to be in full operation by April 2009, but numerous unforeseen issues led to delaying the start of construction. On July 6, 2009, Prairie Hills Motorsports Club received unanimous approval from the Newton County Commissioners for their requested rezoning and Planned Unit Development. On July 24, 2009 Prairie Hills management issued a press release announcing they would \\"move forward at a rapid pace to begin construction of the largest road course facility in North America.\\" On April 9, 2010, the Newton County Board of Commissioners voted to adopt an ordinance establishing the Prairie Hills Economic Improvement District (EID) which will provide support for The Prairie Hills Motorsport Club, an economic improvement project to be developed in Newton County. The formation of the Prairie Hills EID Board will consist of representatives from the Newton County government, the landowner, and the Prairie Hills Motorsport Club. The establishment of the Prairie Hills EID allows for a per-use assessment on all attendees or users of Prairie Hills products or services.  Facility Design  Designed by noted race track architect Paxton Waters, the final development would have included a prominent hotel, conference center, restaurant, spa, retail space, garages, condominiums, karting track, and a 6,000 to 8,000 seat amphitheater. Duke Energy also agreed to erect -tall wind turbines on part of the site, generating electricity feeding a multi-state power grid. Prairie Hills developers said the turbines would be part of the features of renewable energy incorporated in the site design.  Race Track Design  Noted former Formula One and Champ Car racing driver Derek Daly completed the final design of the more than seven miles (11 km) of racing surface in the Prairie Hills facility, incorporating multiple shorter courses which were configured for different driver skill levels. Daly's design included features that would have provided unique features to the course, including corners modeled after the world famous tracks he has driven, most notably an over and under section, along with FIA certification.  Construction  The track construction was scheduled to be done by American Structurepoint, which played an important role in obtaining the necessary Newton County approvals.  Design Revisions  A revised track layout was added to the website, dated 06-13-2009, which no longer linked the North and South circuits, thus excluding the 7+ mile configuration, though a 7+ mile long course was still a viable proposition, as the North and South circuits could have been joined at their closest proximity along the East side of the property. (Note: the referenced site map graphic is laid out with the Southern end of the property to the left and the Northern end to the right.)  The Hollywood Connection  Indiana film producer Justin Escue teamed up with Angelo Pizzo and David Anspaugh, the two creators behind sports movie classics Hoosiers and Rudy, to make 500, The Spectacle Begins, a movie focusing on the inaugural Indianapolis 500, with Prairie Hills as the site for filming the movie. A 1911 vintage one mile (1.6 km) replica of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was added to the site plan, in what would have been the Southwest portion of the property. Pre-production for the movie was begun and casting was to start in October 2009, with filming scheduled to start in May 2010. Visiting the Site For those wishing to take a day trip and visit the development site, but wanting to avoid the numerous gravel roads in the area, it is recommended to approach the property via Indiana State Road 55 to CR 600 N (Fair Oaks Rd.) then going West to CR 100 E and turning South. The Western edge of the property is along East side of CR 100 E and a farm house is in the area where the main entrance is to be located, according to the plot map.

Biography  The son of an Armenian entrepreneur and a Greek mother, he was born as Bedros Markarian in Istanbul. He attended the St. George's Austrian High School in Istanbul and studied economics after his Abitur for some years in Vienna and in Stuttgart. The family moved to Athens in 1954, but Markaris did not settle permanently there until 1964. That year over 15,000 Greeks (Greek passport holders) were expelled from Istanbul and their properties were confiscated, a major blow for the city's millenarian Greek community. Because of his father, he belonged to the Armenian minority for many years and did not have any citizenship; he became a Greek citizen shortly after 1974, together with the rest of the Armenian minority in Greece.Petros Markaris, ŒöŒ±œÑŒÑ ŒµŒæŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœçŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒ∑, ŒïŒ∫Œ¥. Œ†Œ±œÑŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑ 2006, p. 48. Markaris speaks and writes in Greek, Turkish and German. Today he lives in Athens. Literary works Markaris wrote several plays and cooperated with Theo Angelopoulos on a number of film scripts. He translated several German dramas into Greek such as Goethe's Faust I and Faust II, as well as Brecht's Mother Courage. The Costas Haritos series of books (twelve novels and one collection of short stories, as of 2019) are very popular in several European countries such as Greece, Germany, Italy and Spain. Their main hero and first person narrator is a detective in the Athenian criminal police in his fifties, with a squabbling, fairly uneducated, and TV-addicted, but dearly loved wife, an aspiring, but stubborn, law student daughter, and an unpleasant, brown-nosing boss. It is hinted several times that Haritos assisted with the torture of leftist prisoners as a very young man under the Colonels' regime, a fact he is quite ashamed of now, and which makes him insecure whenever he has to deal with political leftists of all shades (obviously a fairly common species in Greece even today). Being somewhat old- fashioned (and not always too consistent) in his personal views, he deplores the loss of Greek traditions (but still has French croissants for breakfast rather than sesame rings), dislikes the masses of foreigners entering Greece (which does not stop him from befriending and highly respecting individual foreigners) and despises corruption (but gives large \\"tips\\" to his physician). His subjective self-deprecating comments contrast well with the objective high work-ethic and even heroism he displays. The modern Athens of rampant air pollution, ugly concrete buildings, constant traffic jams, and hordes of annoying tourists, is the backdrop of the first four novels (the fifth is set in Istanbul). The first three books of the series have seen U.K. editions in English as well, under the titles (all straightforward translations from the Greek titles): \\"Late-Night News\\" (\\"Deadline in Athens\\" in the U.S.), \\"Zone Defence\\" and \\"Che Committed Suicide\\": the next, \\"Main Shareholder\\", as of 2012 has not been published yet in English. The fifth novel in the series, not yet scheduled for publication in English, is named \\"Earlier, Much Earlier\\", and is placed in Istanbul, in the milieu of the local, indigenous Greek community (the Rum). A sixth novel, entitled \\"Expiring Loans\\" (ŒõŒ∑ŒæŒπœÄœÅ·ΩÄŒ∏ŒµœÉŒºŒ± Œî·ºÄŒΩŒµŒπŒ±), was published in Greek in late 2010, and has been translated into several languages. This was the first book in the \\"Crisis Trilogy\\" (Œ§œÅŒπŒªŒøŒ≥·º∞Œ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒöœÅ·º∞œÉŒµœâœÇ), of which the second, \\"Termination\\" (Œ†ŒµœÅŒ±·º∞œâœÉŒ∑), first came out in 2011; the third, \\"Bread, Education, Liberty\\" (Œ®œâŒºŒØ, Œ†Œ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµŒØŒ±, ŒïŒªŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµœÅŒØŒ±) was published in 2012. An epilogue to the series (another full mystery) came out in 2014: \\"End Titles\\" (Œ§ŒØœÑŒªŒøŒπ Œ§Œ≠ŒªŒøœÖœÇ). In addition to the Inspector Haritos novels, Markaris has written a non-fiction work entitled \\"Œó ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒúŒπŒ±œÇ ŒîŒπŒ±Œ¥œÅŒøŒºŒÆœÇ\\" (literally \\"The Athens of a Single Route\\").

It is based on the life of the late American actress and premiered at the National Theatre in London on 1 December 1983. Background Adler had almost completed a full draft with his current composer, Nathan Hurwitz, when his agent contacted him, asking about his interest in working with Hamlisch. Leaving Hurwitz for Hamlisch, several small sections of Hurwitz's music ultimately remained in the production at the National Theatre, uncredited. The production underwent major problems and faced criticism during its developmental and rehearsal stages. The original choreographer was fired and two of the stars suffered ankle injuries. One of them was replaced, resulting in the opening being delayed. Supporters of the National Theatre were dismayed that it was staging the premiere of what was primarily an American musical, and rumors that it was a disaster spread through London. In an interview with Stephen Holden of The New York Times, Hamlisch said, \\"A project like Jean seems awfully risky to a producer. . . . I have to keep reminding myself that A Chorus Line was initially considered weird and off the wall. It was A Chorus Line that convinced me that if you give an audience a theatrical moment, whether it's funny or mean or satiric, they'll accept it as long as it's theatrical. You mustn't underestimate an audience's intelligence.\\" enotes.com Overview The plot covers Seberg's life and career from her first screen appearance in the 1957 Otto Preminger film Saint Joan followed by her acclaim in France prompted by her appearance in Breathless.

Early life Unfortunately what is known for sure about Robert Gigu√®re's life in France is very scant. His parents were Jehan (Le Jeune) Gigu√®re (b. abt. 1580) and Michelle Jornel. Jehan's brother, Jehan \\"The elder\\" married Michelle's sister, Marie. Jehan and Michelle had nine children of which Robert was the sixth. He was baptized in the little church in Tourouvre, in the parish of Saint Aubin on March 9, 1616. Presumably he was born either on that day or just a few days earlier.Our French-Canadian Ancestors, Vol. II, Thomas J. Laforest, 1984 (pp. 119‚Äì125) It is certain that Robert Gigu√®re was in New France in 1651. However, according to George-Emile Gigu√®re and others, in 1644, he was missing from French census records. Indeed, he could have arrived as early as 1642.Robert Gigu√®re : Le Tourouvrain (1616‚Äì1711??), 1979, French. {align=center St. Aubin de Tourouvre Baptismal font at St. Aubin de Tourouvre Close-up of plaque above the baptismal font |} Le Perche Pastoral beauty of Le Perche. Perche comes from the Latin word pertica, which means long pole and more specifically meant in old French very long trees. Hence, sylva pertica meant perche forest. It is not until the 6th century that mention is made of Perche or saltus perticus, expression denoting mountainous forest region, wild game refuge, saltus implying threshold or frontier.Gr√©goire de Tours (6th century). Histoire eccl√©siastique des Francs, cited in Centre G√©n√©alogique de l'Orne et du Perche‚Äôs (CGOP), \\"Le Perche existe-t-il ?\\" Le Perche‚Äô was surrounded by the following Gaulish areas and peoples: in Hyesmois country, where the Exmes people were based in S√©es; in Aulerques Eburoviques country, where the √âvreux people were based in √âvreux; in Aulerques C√©nomans country, where the Maine people were based in Le Mans; and in Carnutes country, where the Chartain people were based in Chartres.Centre G√©n√©alogique de l'Orne et du Perche (CGOP), Formation du Cont√© du Perche Located about west of Paris, ancient Perche province is now located mostly in present-day Normandy r√©gion's Orne d√©partement. The County of Perche was created in 1114, when Rotrou III The Great was attributed the House of Bell√™me allowing control af related estates while retaining control of the Castle of Bell√™me.nugent.fr. A Promise of Glory - Book I France, p. 30 of 119 In 1158, Bell√™me was conceded to Rotrou IV bringing the Rotrou dynasty to the height of its power through control of much of the old forest of Le Perche. He assumed the title of Count of Perche.Nugent.fr. Origins of the Nugent Family Between before 1100 and 1226, three counts of Perche, Routrou III's son Rotrou IV, Geoffroy V and Thomas, consolidated the fusion of Mortagne, Bell√™me and Nogent lands into Perche county. Le Perche was thereafter long granted to King of France relatives. Due to its strategic geographic and political positioning, Le Perche maintained its territorial independence to eventually be returned to the royal domain and become the ancient province bounded by Maine province to the west, Beauce/Orl√©anais province to the east and south, and Normandy province to the north. In 1792, shortly after the onset of the French Revolution, France's ancient provinces were constituted into d√©partements by the Constituent Assembly, Le Perche was carved up among four of them: Orne and Eure-et-Loir for the most part, and to a lesser extent, Sarthe and Loir-et-Cher. As it was in the time of Robert Gigu√®re, Le Perche has remained a beautiful pastoral area consisting mainly of gently rolling farmland, but unlike much of France, it is blessed with some beautiful forests. It also benefits from a number of rivers and streams. Why they came For several reasons, people left their homes in this seemingly idyllic place to begin anew in a strange place so far away. Leaving everything one has loved and known to make a very long, danger- filled journey to an unknown place so far away, could not have been easy. They were not persecuted or forced to leave, and Perche was not a poor area. The Percheron immigration movement's more than 300 people consisted of about 80 families and individuals from Perche. The King of France was offering incentives for settlers to New France including in terms of the establishment of the Company of One Hundred Associates aiming to create seigneuries in Canada's Laurentian valley, for land subdivision to qualified immigrants. Most of the Percheron immigrants settled near Quebec city. The apothecary and surgeon, Robert Giffard de Moncel, born in Perche's Autheuil hamlet near Tourouvre, was in 1634 granted Canada's first agriculture-based seigneurie situated in between Quebec city to the west and Ch√¢teau-Richer and L'Ange- Gardien to the east. Giffard had first come to Quebec in 1621 and had in 1634 travelled with his family as part of a first contingent of immigrants to the Giffard's Beauport seigneurie. Giffard later worked closely with the two Juchereau brothers, Jean and No√´l Juchereau, who immigrated to Canada, as well as their his half brother Pierre Juchereau, all from the Tourouvre area, to recruit people to Canada. The emigrants were often hired for a period of three years, such 'engag√©'s being dubbed Les 36 Mois (the 36-monthers). The Percheron recruits involved a mix of skilled tradesmen and workmen consisting of both families and single individuals each engag√© being paid from 40 to 120 livres per year. In addition, they were guaranteed return transportation across the ocean, subject to being granted a land concession at the end of the contract if they did not return to France. By the time that Samuel de Champlain died in 1635, there were 132 settlers in the colony, ‚Äî35 of them being Percheron. Most of the Percheron departures occurred in the three decades starting in 1634. The Journey Something must be said about the courage of the people who made the perilous journey from France to the New World. These poor souls were subject to all sorts of perils: weather, pirates, and illness among the crew and themselves. With so many variables, the length of the trip could vary from one month to over three. For example, it took Jean Talon 117 days to reach Quebec in 1665, but a mere 35 days for the ship, Arc- en-ciel in 1678. From a navigational perspective, it was generally better to set sail from France before May 1. Ships of the 17th century were generally smaller than , so the accommodations on board were modest. Food would often spoil due to water seepage, and passengers had to settle for cold meals and soggy bedding. Despite all the hardships and perils, most sailors and passengers arrived safely. The first official mention of Robert Gigu√®re in Canada is on February 21, 1651, when he received a grant of land from Sieur Oliver le Tardif. Located in Beaupre, the grant consisted of fronting on the Saint Lawrence River to a depth of , and, in addition to the annual rent of 20 sols and 12 deniers per arpent of frontage, it required Robert to establish a residence thereon within a year. If Gigu√®re was in a position to accept such conditions, it may be assumed that he had been already in the country for some years and was familiar with the land, the climate, and was ready to settle down. However, a 1644 census in France found him absent from the country. Although there is no official record of his life in Canada prior to 1651, some historians feel confident that he arrived in New France as early as 1642 (Robert Gigu√®re: Le Tourouvrain 1616‚Äì1711(??), 1979). Marriage On July 2, 1652, in the Notre-Dame de Qu√©bec Cathedral, Robert Gigu√®re married Aym√©e Miville. He was 36, and she was 17. At that time in our history, men seldom married before the age of 30; women were typically under 20. Aymee was the daughter of Pierre Miville dit Le Suisse (\\"The Swiss\\"). He was a mercenary soldier who had served in the Swiss Guards of Cardinal Richelieu. The marriage was performed by Father Joseph Poncet, and notably the ceremony was attended by Jean de Lauzon, the Governor of New France. This was indeed a great honour and an indication of the respect commanded either by Robert Gigu√®re himself, or by his father in law, Pierre Miville. In 1660, Jean-Baptiste, their fifth child was born. That same year, both Robert and Aym√©e were confirmed at Chateau Richer by Msgr. Fran√ßois de Laval who would be named the first bishop of Quebec, in 1674. Some have said that Jean-Baptiste was a scout in the party of men who walked from Montreal to Schenectady in February 1690, New York and burned the town down in retaliation for the Lacine massacre which occurred in 1689. Death and legacy Indications are that Robert Gigu√®re was a well- respected member of the community: he had donated some land for the Basilica in Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr√©, Quebec and diligently functioned as head vestryman for some time. He is regarded as a founder of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr√©, Quebec. Plaque on church in Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr√©, Quebec Giguerie No death certificate was recorded for Robert Gigu√®re, or perhaps it was lost. However, most historians agree that he died in August 1709, at the age of 93 years and 5 months. His wife, Aym√©e Miville followed him in death three years later, on December 10, 1712. Robert and Aym√©e had 13 children, seven girls and six boys: :* Marie-Charlotte (1653‚Äì????) :* Martin (1655‚Äì????) :* Jeanne (1657‚Äì1673) :* Marie (1659‚Äì1710) :* Jean-Baptiste (1660‚Äì1750) :* Robert (1663‚Äì1711) :* Pierre (1665‚Äì????) :* Marie-Anne (1668‚Äì1762) :* √âtienne (1670‚Äì1749) :* Ange (1671‚Äì????) :* Joseph (1673‚Äì1741) :* Marie-Agn√®s (1675‚Äì1760) :* Marguerite (1678‚Äì1723) Five of his children were married, but only four had children. Of the boys, Joseph, Martin and Jean-Baptiste had children. Joseph and Jean- Baptiste remained in Quebec. Joseph lived out his life in Sainte-Anne-de- Beaupr√©, Quebec, his descendants would later move across from Quebec City to the beautiful √éle d'Orl√©ans. Jean-Baptiste settled in what is now Laprarie, Quebec and his descendants mostly come from Montreal. Martin, ultimately became the ancestor to most all Canadians who call themselves Gigu√®re, or any the many variations of the name. Today there are no direct descendants of Robert Gigu√®re in Tourouvre. One of the few signs that they had been there is a spot known as La Giguerie. They may have disappeared from Le Perche, but thanks to Robert, thousands of people, including the famous hockey player, Jean-S√©bastien Gigu√®re, who call themselves Gigu√®re or one of its many variants, can be found all over North America. Jean-Baptiste Gigu√®re Robert Gigu√®re's son, Jean-Baptiste, may have been involved in the burning of Schenectady in 1690. He may have functioned as a scout on the raid. According to, Monseignat, governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac's secretary in his relation of the Schenectady massacre...\\"A Canadian named Gigu√®re, who had gone with nine Indians to reconnoitre, now returned to say that he had been within sight of Schenectady, and had seen nobody.\\" In his book, Un Gigu√®re a la guerre avec Iberville Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, Georges-Emile Gigu√®re presents evidence that suggests that the \\"Gigu√®re\\" mentioned was Robert's son, Jean-Baptiste. The same Jean-Baptiste may also have been among those who built Fort Detroit.Un Gigu√®re a la Guerre avec Iberville, Georges-Emile Gigu√®re, 1984, French. Spelling variations PRDH_IDG: Gigu√®re variant frenquency There are many variations of the name \\"Gigu√®re\\" in use today throughout North America, the most prevalent of which include, in order of importance: Giguere, Giguiere, Gigueres, Giguieres, Giguerre, Giguier, Gidiere, Giguer, Giere and 64 other variations.

It was built during the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279 CE). The design features the Iron Pagoda towering in the center of the complex, in a style that flourished in Chinese Buddhist temple architecture through the 11th century. History The original temple was magnificent in scale with 280 halls and 24 monasteries. Kaifeng was the capital city of the Northern Song dynasty, and the temple was an important place that the emperors of the dynasty visited often. The imperial examinations were held at the temple, and applicants from throughout the Chinese empire came to take civil service exams. Pagodas The temple's original pagoda was a mammoth octagonal wooden tower of thirteen stories. The eminent architect Yu Hao had designed and engineered it. In 1044, it was hit by lightning and burned to the ground. Iron Pagoda Emperor Renzong of the Northern Song dynasty ordered its replacement. It was designed to resemble the original wooden pagoda but built of glazed bricks so the tower would be fire-resistant and enduring. The 55-metre-high Iron Pagoda, built in 1049, is a solid core, octagonal brick tower with an inner spiral stone staircase and outside openings to allow light and air flow. The architectural style features densely positioned dougong in the eaves (miyan) and multiple storeys (louge). The glazed bricks, brown in color, gave the new tower its name, the Iron Pagoda. The exterior features more than fifty different varieties of brick and 1,600 intricate and richly detailed carvings, including those of sitting Buddha, standing monks, singers and dancers, lions, dragons and other legendary beasts as well as many fine engravings. Under the eaves are 104 bells that ring in the wind. The foundation rests in the silt of the Yellow River. Inside the Iron Pagoda are frescos of the Chinese classical novel, the Journey to the West. In 1847 the Yellow River overflowed its banks and the Youguo Temple collapsed, but the Iron Pagoda survived. Historically, the pagoda has experienced 38 earthquakes, six floods and many other disasters, but it remains intact after almost 1000 years.

It is a gray, red-grey, brown or black solid that is insoluble in water. The material has attracted attention as a component of lithium iron phosphate batteries,Park, O. K.; Cho, Y.; Lee, S.; Yoo, H.-C.; Song, H.-K.; Cho, J., \\"Who Will Drive Electric Vehicles, Olivine or Spinel?\\", Energy Environ. Sci. 2011, volume 4, pages 1621-1633. a type of Li-ion battery. This battery chemistry is targeted for use in power tools, electric vehicles, and solar energy installations. It is also used in OLPC XO education laptops. Most lithium batteries (Li-ion) used in 3C (computer, communication, consumer electronics) products use cathodes made of other lithium compounds, such as lithium cobalt oxide (), lithium manganese oxide (), and lithium nickel oxide (). The anodes are generally made of graphite. Lithium iron phosphate exists naturally in the form of the mineral triphylite, but this material has insufficient purity for use in batteries.  With general chemical formula of , compounds in the family adopt the olivine structure. M includes not only Fe but also Co, Mn and Ti. As the first commercial was C/, the whole group of is informally called ‚Äúlithium iron phosphate‚Äù or ‚Äú‚Äù. However, more than one olivine-type phase may be used as a battery's cathode material. Olivine compounds such as , , and have the same crystal structures as and may replace in a cathode. All may be referred to as ‚ÄúLFP‚Äù. Manganese, phosphate, iron, and lithium also form an olivine structure. This structure is a useful contributor to the cathode of lithium rechargeable batteries. This is due to the olivine structure created when lithium is combined with manganese, iron, and phosphate (as described above). The olivine structures of lithium rechargeable batteries are significant, for they are affordable, stable, and can be safely stored as energy.Wang, J.; Sun, X., \\"Olivine Lifepo4: The Remaining Challenges for Future Energy Storage\\", Energy Environ. Sci. 2015, volume 8, pages 1110-1138. History and production Arumugam Manthiram and John B. Goodenough first identified the polyanion class of cathode materials for lithium ion batteries. was then identified as a cathode material belonging to the polyanion class for use in batteries in 1996 by Padhi et al.\\": A Novel Cathode Material for Rechargeable Batteries\\", A.K. Padhi, K.S. Nanjundaswamy, J.B. Goodenough, Electrochemical Society Meeting Abstracts, 96-1, May, 1996, pp 73‚ÄúPhospho- olivines as Positive-Electrode Materials for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries‚Äù A. K. Padhi, K. S. Nanjundaswamy, and J. B. Goodenough, J. Electrochem. Soc., Volume 144, Issue 4, pp. 1188-1194 (April 1997) Reversible extraction of lithium from and insertion of lithium into was demonstrated. Neutron diffraction confirmed that LFP was able to ensure the security of large input/output current of lithium batteries.Nature Materials, 2008, 7, 707-711. The material can be produced by heating a variety of iron and lithium salts with phosphates or phosphoric acid. Many related routes have been described including those that use hydrothermal synthesis. Physical and chemical properties In , lithium has a +1 charge, iron +2 charge balancing the -3 charge for phosphate. Upon removal of Li, the material converts to the ferric form FePO4. The iron atom and 6 oxygen atoms form an octahedral coordination sphere, described as , with the Fe ion at the center. The phosphate groups, , are tetrahedral. The three-dimensional framework is formed by the octahedra sharing O corners. Lithium ions reside within the octahedral channels in a zigzag manner. In crystallography, this structure is thought to belong to the Pmnb space group of the orthorhombic crystal system. The lattice constants are: a = 6.008 √Ö, b = 10.334 √Ö, and c = 4.693 √Ö. The volume of the unit cell is 291.4 √Ö3. In contrast to two traditional cathode materials - and , lithium ions of migrate in the lattice's one-dimensional free volume. During charge/discharge, the lithium ions are extracted concomitant with oxidation of Fe: :LiFe^{II}PO4 <=> Fe^{III}PO4 + Li+ + e- Extraction of lithium from produces with a similar structure. adopts a Pmnb space group with a unit cell volume of 272.4 3, only slightly smaller than that of its lithiated precursor. Extraction of lithium ions reduces the lattice volume, as is the case with lithium oxides. 's corner-shared octahedra are separated by the oxygen atoms of the 3- tetrahedra and cannot form a continuous network, reducing conductivity. A nearly close-packed hexagonal array of oxides centers provides relatively little free volume for Li+ ions to migrate within. For this reason, the ionic conductivity of Li+ is relatively low at ambient temperate. The details of the lithiation of FePO4 and the delithiation of LiFePO4 have been examined. Two phases of the lithiated material are implicated.Malik, R.; Abdellahi, A.; Ceder, G., \\"A Critical Review of the Li Insertion Mechanisms in LiFePO4 Electrodes\\", J. Electrochem. Soc. 2013, volume 160, pages A3179-A3197. Applications LFP batteries have an operating voltage of 3.3 V, charge density of 170mAh/g, high power density, long cycle life and stability at high temperatures. LFP's major commercial advantages are that it poses few safety concerns such as overheating and explosion, as well as long cycle lifetimes, high power density and has a wider operating temperature range. Power plants and automobiles use LFP.Rechargeable Li-ion batteries based on Olivine- structured (LiFePO4) cathode materials - Kumar et al, Nov 15, 2015, retrieved April 1, 2020https://offgridham.com/2016/03/about-lifepo4-batteries/ BAE has announced that their HybriDrive Orion 7 hybrid bus uses about 180 kW LFP battery cells. AES has developed multi-trillion watt battery systems that are capable of subsidiary services of the power network, including spare capacity and frequency adjustment. In China, BAK and Tianjin Lishen are active in the area.  Comparison  Although LFP has 25% less capacity than other lithium batteries due to its operational voltage (3.2 volts vs 3.7 for Co based cathode chemistries), it has 70% more than nickel-hydrogen batteries. The major differences between LFP batteries and other lithium batteries ion battery types is that LFP batteries contain no cobalt (removing ethical questions about material sourcing) and have a flat discharge curve. LFP batteries have drawbacks, including higher costs due to lower energy density. The energy density is significantly lower than (although higher than the nickel-metal hydride battery). Lithium cobalt oxide has based battery chemistries are more prone to thermal runaway if overcharged and Cobalt is both expensive and not widely available. Other chemistries such as NMC Ni Mn Co have supplanted LiCo chemistry cells in most applications. The original ratio of Ni to Mn to Co was 3:3:3 today, cells are being made with ratios of 8:1:1 whereby the Co content has been drastically reduced. Intellectual property The root patents of LFP compounds are held by four organizations. University of Texas-Austin for the discovery of the material. Hydro-Qu√©bec, Universit√© de Montr√©al and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) for the carbon coating that enhance its conductivity and actually makes LFP suitable for industrial developments.http://www.clariant.com.br/C12576850036A6E9/8650B24BC3A7BAF3C12579C2003552DA/$FILE/20120314_BASF_enters_into_a_sublicense_agreement_with_LiFePO4C_Licensing_AG.pdf These patents underlie mature mass production technologies. The largest production capacity is up to 250 tons per month. The key feature of from A123 is the nano-LFP, which modifies its physical properties and adds noble metals in the anode, as well as the use of special graphite as the cathode. The main feature of from Phostech is increased capacitance and conductivity by an appropriate carbon coating. The special feature of ‚Ä¢ zM from Aleees a high capacitance and low impedance obtained by the stable control of the ferrites and crystal growth. This improved control is realized by applying strong mechanical stirring forces to the precursors in high oversaturation states, which induces crystallization of the metal oxides and LFP. In patent lawsuits in the US in 2005 and 2006, the University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas-Austin and Hydro-Qu√©bec claimed that as the cathode infringed their patents, and . The patent claims involved a unique crystal structure and a chemical formula of the battery cathode material. On April 7, 2006, A123 filed an action seeking a declaration of non-infringement and invalidity UT's patents. A123 separately filed two ex parte Reexamination Proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in which they sought to invalidate the patents based upon prior art. In a parallel court proceeding, UT sued Valence Technology, Inc. (\\"Valence\\") - a company that commercializes LFP products that alleged infringement. The USPTO issued a Reexamination Certificate for the '382 patent on April 15, 2008 and for the '640 patent on May 12, 2009, by which the claims of these patents were amended. This allowed the current patent infringement suits filed by Hydro-Quebec against Valence and A123 to proceed. After a markman hearing, on April 27, 2011 the Western District Court of Texas held that the claims of the reexamined patents had a narrower scope than as originally granted. On Dec 9th, 2008, the European Patent Office revoked Dr. Goodenough‚Äôs patent numbered 0904607. This decision basically reduced the patent risk of using LFP in European automobile applications. The decision is believed to be based on the lack of novelty. The first major large settlement was the lawsuit between NTT and the University of Texas-Austin (UT). In October 2008, NTT announced that they would settle the case in the Japan Supreme Civil Court for $30 million. As part of the agreement UT agreed that NTT did not steal the information and that NTT would share its LFP patents with UT. NTT‚Äôs patent is also for an olivine LFP, with the general chemical formula of (A is for alkali metal and M for the combination of Co and Fe), now used by BYD Company. Although chemically the materials are nearly the same, from the viewpoint of patents, of NTT is different from the materials covered by UT. has higher capacity than . At the heart of the case was that NTT engineer Okada Shigeto, who had worked in the UT labs developing the material, was accused of stealing UT‚Äôs intellectual property. Research  Power density  LFP has two shortcomings: low conductivity and low lithium diffusion constant, both of which limit the charge/discharge rate. Adding conducting particles in delithiated raises its electron conductivity. For example, adding conducting particles with good diffusion capability like graphite and carbon to powders significantly improves conductivity between particles, increases the efficiency of and raises its reversible capacity up to 95% of the theoretical values. shows good cycling performance even under charge/discharge current as large as 5C.  Stability  Coating LFP with inorganic oxides can make LFP‚Äôs structure more stable and increase conductivity. Traditional with oxide coating shows improved cycling performance. This coating also inhibits dissolution of Co and slows the decay of capacity. Similarly, with an inorganic coating such as ZnO and , has a better cycling lifetime, larger capacity and better characteristics under rapid discharge. The addition of a conductive carbon increases efficiency. Mitsui Zosen and Aleees reported that addition of conducting metal particles such as copper and silver increased efficiency. with 1 wt% of metal additives has a reversible capacity up to 140mAh/g and better efficiency under high discharge current. Metal substitution Substituting other metals for the iron or lithium in can also raise efficiency. Substituting zinc for iron increases crystallinity of because zinc and iron have similar ion radii. Cyclic voltammetry confirms that , after metal substitution, has higher reversibility of lithium ion insertion and extraction. During lithium extraction, Fe (II) is oxidized to Fe (III) and the lattice volume shrinks. The shrinking volume changes lithium‚Äôs returning paths. Synthesis processes Mass production with stable and high quality still faces many challenges. Similar to lithium oxides, may be synthesized by a variety of methods, including: solid-phase synthesis, emulsion drying, sol- gel process, solution coprecipitation, vapor-phase deposition, electrochemical synthesis, electron beam irradiation, microwave process, hydrothermal synthesis, ultrasonic pyrolysis and spray pyrolysis. In the emulsion drying process, the emulsifier is first mixed with kerosene. Next, the solutions of lithium salts and iron salts are added to this mixture. This process produces nanocarbon particles. Hydrothermal synthesis produces with good crystallinity. Conductive carbon is obtained by adding polyethylene glycol to the solution followed by thermal processing. Vapor phase deposition produces a thin film . In flame spray pyrolysis FePO4 is mixed with Lithium carbonate and glucose and charged with electrolytes. The mixture is then injected inside a flame and filtered to collect the synthesized .

It opened to the public on December 28, 1956, and is one of the few \\"Grand Polynesian Palaces of Tiki\\" still in operation today. In 2015 it was named the \\"best tiki bar in the world\\" by Critiki, an organization of fans of Polynesian pop culture. It is the last restaurant/bar in existence carrying on the traditions of service and serving the original drink recipes of Don the Beachcomber, and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Mai-Kai was created by brothers Bob and Jack Thornton. They visited Don the Beachcomber in Chicago as children and even at that young age said they wanted to open a similar place. While attending college at Stanford University they often visited Trader Vic's restaurant in San Francisco. In 1955 after completing service in the armed forces, the brothers settled in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Still less than 30 years old, they decided to open a Polynesian restaurant in an undeveloped area of Oakland Park, a suburb of Fort Lauderdale. Although the area seemed remote at first - \\"the middle of nowhere on U.S. 1\\" - a tourist industry was growing in Florida in the 1950s, and both cities were undergoing rapid residential expansion, so that the restaurant immediately developed a clientele of both locals and tourists. The original restaurant was designed by architect Charles F. McKirahan Sr. and decorated by Wayne Davidson. It cost $350,000 to complete, making it the most expensive restaurant built in the US that year. It earned more than a million dollars in its first year. It quickly became one of the top-grossing restaurants in the United States, and for many years it sold more rum than any other location in Florida. When the brothers opened the Mai-Kai they hired away number 2 chef Lin Ark Lee, known as Kenny Lee, number 2 bartender Mariano Licudine, maitre d' Andy Tanato and seating captain and purchasing agent Robert Van Dorpe from the Chicago Don the Beachcomber, along with many staff members. Van Dorpe became the first general manager of the Mai-Kai. The original restaurant contained five dining rooms and a 19-seat \\"Surfboard Bar\\" made of surfboards. Originally the roof of the Garden seating area was open. The constant nuisance of moving guests out of the rain caused them to enclose the roof with glass. That glass roof was opened and closed until maintenance issues kept it closed. In 1970, Jack Thornton sold his interest in the Mai-Kai to his brother Bob after he was struck ill by an aneurysm. Bob then expanded the restaurant, more than doubling its capacity. Bob died in 1989. Today the restaurant is run by Bob's stepson David Levy as CEO and his stepdaughter Kulani Thornton Gelardi as CFO. The restaurant The main building is one story with a large A-frame thatched roof. A wooden slat bridge is crossed to reach the porte cochere and entrance. The Mai-Kai has been expanded several times, largely achieving its present layout and appearance by 1971. It now includes eight dining rooms, a bar, a stage in the center of the restaurants to showcase the Polynesian Islander Revue floor show, a gift shop, and tropical gardens. The interior is decorated with nautical and South Sea artifacts. The largest renovation started in 1970 and took two years to complete. Even during construction projects, the Mai-Kai never closed, and the owners stipulated that the work must be done in such a way that customers could not see or hear it. This often meant the work was done in the wee hours of the morning. In 2009 the restaurant completed a several-years-long renovation to repair damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. The current Mai-Kai is much like it was in the 1970s. The waitresses at the Mai-Kai's Molokai Bar are attired in bikini tops and wraparound sarongs. The menu maintains a Polynesian-Asian theme, and the cocktail menu (designed by Mariano Licudine) is largely unchanged since 1956. The Polynesian show The Mai-Kai Islanders Revue opened in 1962, with two performances a night. Mireille Thornton was an early dancer in the show, later marrying Bob Thornton. By 1970 she was the choreographer, talent recruiter, and costume designer for the show. As she was born and raised in Tahiti, she was able to create authentic South Pacific dances and costumes. The Mai-Kai Islanders Revue is the longest running Polynesian show in the United States. The Mai-Kai Gardens The Mai-Kai has taken advantage of the year-round growing season and tropical climate to its fullest advantage. The surrounding gardens feature walking paths through tropical vegetation, simulated rock formations, waterfalls, ponds, and Tiki statues. Some of the palms and orchids are over fifty years old. On June 8, 2009, a massive carving by Barney West that stood in the gardens for decades collapsed. It was replaced by a piece that had stood in the original Surfboard Bar in 1956. Polynesian artifacts The Mai-Kai contains many genuine Polynesian artifacts, some that are over 100 years old. Much of the original collection of Polynesian artifacts was donated to the Thortons' alma mater, Stanford University, in the 1970s. Another part of the collection was donated to the Fort Lauderdale art museum. An insurance appraisal put such a high value on the artifacts that it made the Mai-Kai virtually uninsurable.

Fontenot, who grew up working on a family farm, inherited his musical skills from his parents, who played accordion; his father Adam, known as \\"Nonc Adam\\", played with Am√©d√© Ardoin. Canray first played a cigar-box fiddle that had strings taken off the screen door of his home. His bow was made from the branches of pear trees and sewing thread. Canray stated: \\"So, we took some cigar boxes... In those days, cigar boxes were made of wood. So, we worked at it and finally made ourselves a fiddle. For our strings, we had no real strings ... we took strands off the screen door. We made fiddles out of that stuff, and then we started practicing.\\" He visited a neighbor \\"to see how he tuned his fiddle. He would sound a string, and then I would try mine, but I couldn't go as high as his fiddle; every time I tried to match his pitch, I'd break a string.... But then when he would break a string, I would take the longest end. Then my fiddle sounded pretty good. And that's how I learned. It's just a matter of having music on your mind.\\" Music career By 1934, Fontenot had begun performing with Am√©d√© Ardoin, who wanted him to play on a recording session with him in New York; however, his parents would not allow him to travel. In the late 1930s, he formed a string band with George Lenard and Paul Frank, playing boogie woogie, western swing and jazz as well as traditional tunes, but after a few years Fontenot established a more lasting partnership with accordionist Alphonse \\"Bois Sec\\" Ardoin (a cousin of Am√©d√©) from nearby Duralde. In 1948 the pair formed the Duralde Ramblers, who became highly popular in south west Louisiana and made many radio broadcasts through the 1950s, notably on KEUN in Eunice. He also began writing songs. His most well- known original songs are \\"Joe Pitre a Deux Femmes\\", \\"Les Barres de la Prison\\", and \\"Bonsoir Moreau\\", which have become standards in the Cajun and Zydeco music repertoires. Fontenot was never a professional musician; he was a rice farmer for many years, and also worked as a labourer in a feed store in the town of Welsh. Fontenot and Ardoin made their debut outside of Louisiana in 1966, performing at the Newport Folk Festival. At the time, Fontenot had not performed in public for several years, but was persuaded to do so by folklorist Ralph Rinzler. Following the festival, the pair recorded an album with producer Dick Spottswood, Les Blues Du Bayou, and from then on started appearing in a steady stream of festivals in Louisiana and around the world, becoming the last Creole musicians playing music in the \\"old style\\". In 1986, Fontenot and Ardoin were both awarded National Heritage Fellowships by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. Also in 1986, he and Ardoin were appointed adjunct professors at the University of Southwestern Louisiana. In later years he was featured in many documentaries on Cajun and Creole culture, including the 1989 film J'ai Ete au Bal as well as PBS's American Patchwork Don't Drop the Potato. He also performed in New Orleans and toured Europe with the band Fil√©. There is a portrait of Canray in Yasha Aginsky's 1983 film Cajun Visits, and in Jean-Pierre Bruneau's 1993 film Louisiana Blues, edited by Yasha Aginsky. Canray Fontenot died in 1995 at his home in Welsh, Louisiana, from cancer. Legacy The New Orleans culture magazine OffBeat Magazine has compared Fontenot to contemporary artist , who also performs music of the \\"Cajun French\\" style. Mark DeWitt, an expert of Louisiana's traditional music styles has noted that modern zydeco style has moved away from the fiddle to emphasize the accordion. Zydeco DJ James \\"J.B.\\" Adams has noted that most of the Creole fiddlers have died: \\"When Canray passed, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs gone. It‚Äôs almost like a lost art.\\" Recordings Fontenot's music can be found on Arhoolie Records, CD 381, Canray Fontenot: Louisiana Hot Sauce, Creole Style, 1993; also on Arhoolie Records, Les Blues de Bayou, 1970; and also on Arhoolie Records, La Musique Creole, 1983. :*\\"Les Blues du Voyageur\\" Canray Fontenot & Alphonse 'Bois-Sec' Ardoin Listen (MP3) :*\\"Jolie Bassette\\" Canray Fontenot & Alphonse 'Bois-Sec' Ardoin Listen (MP3) See also *History of Cajun Music *List of Notable People Related to Cajun Music Notes a.

The battle has been influential in both Islamic history and contemporary time because of the controversial jihad against other Muslims and Ramadan related fatwas issued by Ibn Taymiyyah, who himself joined the battle. The battle, a disastrous defeat for the Mongols, put an end to Mongol invasions of the Levant. Previous Mongol-Muslim conflict A string of Mongol victories, starting in 1218 when they had invaded Khwarezm, quickly gave the Mongols control over most of Persia as well as the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum of Asia Minor. Incorporating troops from vassal countries such as Cilician Armenia and the Kingdom of Georgia, the Mongols had sacked Baghdad in 1258, followed by the taking of Aleppo and Damascus in 1260. Later that same year, the Mongols had experienced their first major defeat at the Battle of Ain Jalut, which eventually forced the Mongols out of Damascus and Aleppo and back across the Euphrates. Nearly 40 years later, the Ilkhan Ghazan, once again invaded Syria, retaking Aleppo in 1299. Ghazan defeated Mamluk forces at the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar that same year, and Damascus quickly surrendered to him. After sending raiding parties as far south as Gaza, Ghazan withdrew from Syria. Events just before the battle In 1303, Ghazan sent his general Qutlugh-Shah with an army to recapture Syria. The inhabitants and rulers of Aleppo and Hama fled to Damascus to escape the advancing Mongols. However, Baibars II was in Damascus and sent a message to the Sultan of Egypt to come to fight the Mongols. The Sultan left Egypt with an army to engage the Mongols in Syria, and arrived while the Mongols were attacking Hama. The Mongols had reached the outskirts of Damascus on April 19 to meet the Sultan's army. The Mamluks then made their way to the plain of Marj al-Saffar, where the battle would take place. The battle The battle commenced on 2 Ramadhan 702 in the Hijri calendar, or April 20, 1303. Qutlugh-Shah's army was positioned near a river. Hostilities began when Qutlugh-Shah's left wing attacked the Mamluk's right wing with his brigade of 10,000 soldiers. The Egyptians reportedly suffered heavy casualties. The Mamluk center and left wings under the command of the emirs Salar and Baibars al-Jashnakir, together with their Bedouin irregulars, then engaged the Mongols. The Mongols continued their pressure on the right flank of the Egyptian army. Many of the Mamluks believed that the battle would soon be lost. The Mamluk left flank, however, had remained steady. Qutlugh-Shah then went to the top of a nearby hill, hoping to watch the victory of his forces. While he was issuing orders to his army, the Egyptians surrounded the hill. This led to heavy, bitter fighting, and the Mongols suffered many casualties on the hill. The next morning, the Mamluks deliberately opened their ranks to allow the Mongols to flee to the river Wadi Arram. When the Mongols arrived at the river, they were able to receive reinforcements. However, while the Mongols were taking on badly needed supplies of water for themselves and their horses, the Sultan was able to attack them from the rear. The subsequent fighting, which lasted until noon, was vicious. By the next day, the battle was over.Al- Maqrizi , Al Selouk Leme'refatt Dewall al-Melouk Aftermath According to the medieval Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi, after the battle, Qutlugh-Shah reached the Ilkhan Ghazan at Kushuf, to inform him of the defeat of his forces. It was reported that Ghazan, upon hearing the news, had gone into such a rage that it resulted in a nose bleed.Quatremere, vol II, Translation. Messages were sent to Egypt and Damascus to tell of the victory, and the Sultan went to Damascus. While the Sultan was in Damascus, the Mamluk army kept chasing the Mongols as far as Al- Qaryatayn.

The statues are the remains of a sanctuary for one of the most mysterious cults of antiquity, the cult of Magna Mater. Although very badly preserved, the site is unique for its scale and for the completeness of the sculptures. It is believed to have been the principal centre of the cult of the goddess Cybele in Sicily.Giulia Sfameni Gasparro, \\"I culti orientali in Sicilia\\", Leiden, E.J. BRILL, 1973. Cap. II, pp 126-149 & tab. LXVI-CIV. . For stylistic reasons and as a result of archaeological discoveries in the surrounding area, the sanctuary has been dated by scholars to around the fourth or third centuries BC.  Location  The hill on which Akrai was founded had been inhabited since very ancient times. In fact, on its northern slope, a shelter under the rock has yielded abundant evidence of stone age material which shows all the characteristics of the Upper Palaeolithic and is to this day the oldest securely identified habitation in all Sicily. Thucydides reports that Akrai was founded in 665/4 BC by the Syracusans on a plateau bounded by steep cliffs and by four streams, from which all routes of access could be dominated.Thucydides 6.5 The city guaranteed free communication between Syracuse, the Greek cities on the southern coast of Sicily and the Sicel cities in the interior. During the fourth and fifth centuries AD, Akrai is mentioned as the most important Christian centre of eastern Sicily after Syracuse itself, as affirmed by the vast catacombs found there. It is not known when the city ceased to exist, but the historian Michele Amari suggested that its destruction occurred in 827, during the Islamic conquest of Sicily.Michele Amari, \\"Storia dei Musulmani in Sicilia\\", Firenze, 1854. The medieval Palazzolo Acreide, the nearest settlement to Akrai, is mentioned for the first time in the geography of Edrisi.\\"L'Italia descritta nel ‚ÄúLibro di Re Ruggero‚Äù compilato da Edrisi\\", translated by M. Amari & C. Schiaparelli, Roma, 1883.  Description  Statue of Magna Mater The large sanctuary complex is located along the south side of Orbo Hill, on a rocky outcrop overlooking a path with two flat semi-circular areas at each end. Circular stones, which are probably altars, are visible in the two semi-circular areas and along the path. The sculptures are found in twelve wide niches carved into the rock, eleven on one level and another one on a lower level. Other smaller niches with no images complete the structure, which has a regular architectural design, indicating that it was a single sanctuary rather than a collection of votive reliefs. The discovery of lamps and small paterae supports the identification of the site as the seat of a cult.Luigi Bernab√≤ Brea, Akrai, La Cartotecnica, Catania, 1956 In eleven of the niches the image of the goddess is depicted enthroned with other figures surrounding her. In the twelfth niche she is depicted standing on her feet at life size. The identification of the goddess in the niches as Cybele (Magna Mater) derives from the comparison of the iconography with representations of her elsewhere in the Greek world, particularly at Athens. The goddess is depicted with a pleated chiton and a himation gathered over her left shoulder and falling to her knees. Her hair is in a \\"melon-like\\" style with two long ringlets falling down over her shoulders and a modius on her head. At her sides, there are two lions in heraldic positions. A patera is clearly visible in the right hand of some of the sculptures and a tympanum in the left hand. In other sculptures these implements cannot be made out, but the general similarity between the reliefs and light traces of figural relief suggest that they were once present. Two iconographic postures are used: that of the goddess seated on her throne, often within a naiskos (shrine), which is characteristic of north Ionic and south Aeolic depictions; and that of the goddess standing upright, which is more typical of southern Ionia. Both models can be seen also in Phrygian rural sculpture and in some parts of Asia Minor very similar and nearly contemporary depictions can be found in rural sanctuaries of Magna Mater. The closest parallels are the sanctuary of Meter Steunene of the Aizanoi in Phrygia, the small sanctuary of Kapikaya near Pergamon and the sacred complex of Panajir Dagh near Ephesus. Minor figures are depicted next to the goddess Cybele in about five of the niches (the poor state of conservation makes it impossible to exclude the possibility that there were originally more of these minor figures). These include Hermes, Attis, Hecate, the Dioscuri, the Galli and the Corybantes. Although the connection of these figures with the goddess can be reconstructed from many literary, epigraphic and monumental sources, the simultaneous presence of all of them is an absolutely unique feature of the Santoni, which is not known from any other example. Three iconographic schemata can be recognised in the combination of these minor figures, each of which is related to specific religious motifs known from Hellenistic and Roman monuments. The first schema is employed in five of the reliefs and is characterised by the Galli (mythic and ritual priests of the goddess) and the Corybantes (mythical companions of the Galli), depicted as two small figures on either side of Cybele's head. They wear tunics, often with an overcloak and a Phrygian cap and carry their identifying symbols: a tympaneum in their left hand and a rod in their right. The combination of Cybele, Hermes and Attis seen in another relief is the second iconographic schema known from other Greek depictions. In this relief which is largely intact, Cybele is in an unusual position, standing with her arms outstretched with her left hand on Attis' head and her right hand on Hermes' head, in a protective gesture. Hermes and Attis are recognisable by their attributes (the caduceus and the shepherd's staff respectively) and by their crossed legs. To the right of Attis a female individual is depicted who is very poorly preserved - only her broad contours and some drapery can be made out properly. She appears to be walking and holding an object in her left hand, which might be a long torch of the sort carried by Hecate Dadophora. This connects to a third iconographical schema known from Hellenistic and Roman monuments: the divine triad of Cybele, Hermes and Hecate. There is another element worthy of note in this relief: two individuals riding on large horses - probably the Dioscuri, who are also associated with the Magna Mater and her mysteries in epigraphic and artistic sources. In the richness and complexity of their depictions, the Santoni offer, therefore, a sort of synthesis of the iconography and religious ideas connected to the Magna Mater's cult. The uniqueness of the monument lies primarily in the presence of so many of the individuals which are connected to her in disparate literary, epigraphic and artistic sources. In no other known case are so many found in a single composition.  Excavation and scholarship  Artistic depiction of the relief from Houel, Voyage Pittoresque, Vol. III, 1785, table 198 The Santoni were mentioned for the first time by Ignazio Patern√≤ Castello, Prince of Biscari, in his 1781 book, Viaggio per tutte le antichit√† della SiciliaIgnazio Patern√≤ Principe di Biscari, Viaggio per tutte le antichit√† della Sicilia, Napoli, 1781 (3¬™ ed., Palermo 1817). and again a few years later by the French artist Jean-Pierre Hou√´l who provided a description and classicising reconstructions.Jean-Pierre Hou√´l, Voyage Pittoresque des Isles de Sicilie, de Malte, et de Lipari, 4 vol., Paris, 1787, Vol. III, 1785, pp 112-114 e tavv. 196-198. Houel's images are not accurate and, along with his interpretation of the Santoni as funerary sculptures, they led later scholars to erroneous conclusions. For example, in the picture from Houel at right, the lions which flank the goddess are instead depicted as dogs (encouraging a viewer to identify her as Artemis). Proper archaeological investigation began in the nineteenth century, with the work of Baron Gabriele Iudica, royal custodian of antiquities in the Valle di Noto, who went looking for the tombs that Houel had published and found the other groups of sculptures, a paved path, and objects like lamps and small paterae.Gabriele Iudica, Real custode delle antichit√† del Val di Noto, Le antichit√† di Acre, scoperte, descritte e illustrate, Messina 1819. Iudica shared the interpretation of Houel, considering the sculptures to be funerary monuments. In 1840, Domenico Lo Faso, Duke of Serradifalco published a description of the site with illustrations by Francesco Saverio Cavallari and, following the interpretation of the Santoni as funerary monuments, identified the main figure as Isis- Persephone. This theory was followed in the next century by Paolo Orsi and by Pace who interpreted the sculptures as Demeter and Kore - the two Sicilian divinities par excellence. The authority of the last two scholars long overwhelmed the alternative opinion of Alexander Conze who, using Cavallari's illustrations, first made the connection between the Santoni and Anatolian and Greek depictions of Cybele.Alexander Conze, \\"Hermes Cadmilos\\", Arch. Zeit. 38, 1880, pp. 1-10 In excavations by the Superintendency of Antiquities in 1953, Rosario Carta produced precise illustrations of the sculptures and Prof. Luigi Bernab√≤ Brea took photographs which were published in a volume which allowed the sanctuary to be seen in the wider context of the diffusion of the cult of Cybele through the Greco-Roman world. The recognition of the unified structure of the site, however, was only established by the detailed study of Prof. Giulia Sfameni Gasparro, who through the comparison of a wide series of documents relating to the religious and historical context in which the sanctuary belongs, reconstructed the meaning of the sanctuary as far as its poor state of conservation allows in her book I Culti Orientali in Sicilia.

It is the only species in the genus Santanachelys, which itself is a member of the extinct family Protostegidae. The species was first described from a 20-centimeter long fossil specimen unearthed in 1998 from the Santana Formation of eastern Brazil. From the rock layer from which it was excavated, it was determined that the specimen was from the Early Cretaceous period (112 million years old). It is therefore one of the oldest known sea turtles. It was even recorded as the oldest sea turtle in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, but a new fossil named Desmatochelys padillai in 2015 is estimated to be as old as 120 million years. While the specimen showed many characteristics of modern sea turtles, it differed from the typical sea turtle body plan in several ways. One glaring difference is that Santanachelys had distinguishable digits at the tip of its forearms. Instead of the fully fused, hydrodynamic paddles that modern sea turtles possess, the early sea turtle's digits were distinct and movable similar to that of non-marine turtles. Like later sea turtles though, Santanachelys had large salt glands situated near its eyes, which aided with the excretion of excess salt. This was an adaptation to the highly saline marine environment. Evolutionarily, the morphology of Santanachelys is typical of what is expected of an early sea turtle. The front appendages not being fully evolved into flippers is a sign of this. The presence of large foramen in the turtle's skull where salt glands where is an interesting evolutionary point. It is pointed out that this suggests that the evolutionary return to oceanic waters of the sea turtle line evolved before the finalization and streamlining of the line's paddles. Taxonomically, Santanachelys has been placed in the family Protostegidae along with many other extinct sea turtles. It is the earliest member of the family to date, and the earliest known member of the sea turtle superfamily, Chelonioidea. Cladistically, it is the sister taxon to the rest of the later protostegids, including Protostega and Notochelone. As a member of its family, its closest living relative belongs to the family Dermochelyidae, the leatherback turtle. Its genus, Santanachelys was named for the Santana Formation, the locality where the fossil was found and chelys, Greek for \\"turtle\\". The species name, S. gaffneyi was named in honor of Eugene S. Gaffney, a paleontologist who specialized in turtle phylogeny.

The Bee was criticized for sensationalizing alleged attacks by black men in 1919 with headlines such as \\"\\"Frenzied thousands join the orgy of blood and fire\\" which escalated inter- racial hatreds that resulted in the Omaha Race Riot of 1919. It involved three deaths and thousands of dollars in property damages.Jan Voogd, \\"Race Riots and Resistance: The Red Summer of 1919\\" Peter Lang, 2008 page 108For front pages in 1919 see \\"\\"\\"Frenzied thousands join the orgy of blood and fire\\" The newspaper was sold to millionaire Nelson B. Updike, a local grain dealer, in 1920. In 1927, Updike purchased the Omaha Daily News and merged his papers to form the Bee-News. In June 1928 the Bee-News was sold to William Randolph Hearst. In October 1937, Hearst sold the paper to the Omaha World-Herald for $750,000, which promptly discontinued its publication. According to a 1954 World-Herald report, \\"Edward Rosewater actually did not have journalism in mind when he launched the first edition of the Bee on June 19, 1871, to influence the public in favor of the ratification of a legislative bill originated by him, creating the Board of Education.\\" Bee and Bee-News alumni include Don Hollenbeck, who later worked for CBS News.

The show was hosted by Arsenio Hall at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. Australian group INXS was the night's biggest winner and nominee, taking home five awards out of nine nominations. The group's awards included Video of the Year and Viewer's Choice, making this the first of few times in which the same artist and video took home these two awards in the one night. INXS's nominations, meanwhile, totaled up to nine: eight for \\"Need You Tonight/Mediate\\" (making it the year's most nominated video) and one for \\"Devil Inside\\". In the meantime, George Harrison and U2 were tied in for second place in terms of nominations, as each picked up eight nominations that year. Furthermore, both artists split their nominations between two different videos in 1988, and at least once both of their videos competed against one another in the same category (and so did INXS's videos). Finally, this year's show saw the elimination of another category, as the award for Best Overall Performance in a Video was not handed out this year or ever again. At the same time, the category of Most Experimental Video was renamed \\"Breakthrough Video\\", a name that it still keeps (as of the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards).

Antonio Severino Bernal Mu√±oz (January 8, 1925 ‚Äì April 19, 2010, known by his first name and by his paternal family name Jos√© Bernal) was a Cuban- American artist, born in Santa Clara, Cuba, in the former province of Las Villas (now Villa Clara) and became a naturalized U.S.A. citizen in 1980. Bernal's aesthetics stemmed from his Cuban birth and the experience of exile and renewal. His art has been described as modernist, abstract, and expressionist. The term postmodernist also may be applied to Bernal's diverse and complex body of work, specifically as he rejected the notion of the new in art, a characteristic imbued in postmodern theory.  Biography  Life in Cuba Madre tierra (The Good Earth), Bernal, 1943 When Bernal was a child, he was privately tutored in art and music. He was graduated from Normal Teachers College in 1945 and began teaching at a series of public and private schools in the province of Las Villas. Simultaneously, he enrolled in the Escuela de Artes Pl√°sticas Leopoldo Roma√±ach where he earned his MFA. His musical and visual creations were performed and exhibited in Santa Clara and Havana. In 1961, \\"... during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Bernal was among the throngs of Cubans arrested for unpatriotic behavior and confined for eleven days in the gymnasium of the Marta Abreu University in Santa Clara. Bernal's offense was refusal to work in the fields cutting sugar cane. After his release, the threat of execution haunted [him] and his wife, and they cautiously initiated plans to leave the country with their three young children. It took more than a year to obtain visas ...\\"Dorothy Chaplik, \\"The Art of Jos√© Bernal,\\" essay in artnet Monographs. and with the help of the Methodist Church, the Bernals were able to board a Pan Am flight for the United States of America in June 1962. Campfire in the Woods, Bernal, 1950 Life in the United States The Bernal family entered the United States in Miami, Florida. Their stay in the state was brief ‚Äì a few months on account of the scarcity of employment. Subsequently, in autumn of 1962 they relocated to Chicago, Illinois. Bernal confronted the need to support his family and, because of language barriers, became employed in a factory designing artistic materials for commercial purposes. Meanwhile, he continued to produce personal art. Critics during this period observed his work revealed a transformation affected by the change in geographical environment. While in Cuba his palette did not reflect the brilliant, intense colors of his native land; but in Chicago he began to incorporate in his art the tropical hues of his Caribbean homeland. In 1964, Bernal's art portfolio was reviewed by an executive at Marshall Field's and he was offered a position as Senior Designer. There, the director of Field's fine arts gallery persuaded Bernal to exhibit his impressionist portraits, landscapes and still lifes. Shortly thereafter, \\"... Betty Parsons, art dealer, artist, and collector, discovered Bernal's work and began a series of orders to show and sell his paintings at Dayton's art galleries in Minneapolis. The lucrative connection made it possible for Bernal to give up his job at [Marshall] Field's and return to school where he could pursue his dual dream of teaching and painting.\\" After being granted an MFA evaluation by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970, Bernal returned to teaching art while continuing to create and exhibit his works. Lydia Murman, art critic of the New Art Examiner, wrote about Bernal's 1981 solo exhibition of collage and assemblage: \\"Bernal's works involve the viewer because they resurrect the concern for art as a communicative force. The viewer reacts to the classical arrangement, in which found objects are manipulated with a respect for their physical properties and for their potential symbolic value. While warm wood, old newspaper print, tarnished metal, and antique objects produce an aura that absorbs the viewer and stirs archetypal images within his subconscious, some works, such as \\"Balancing the Unbalanced,\\" in which a faucet is perceived as a faucet, invite the viewer to open the dialogue concerning substance and illusion, art and reality.\\"Lydia Murman, \\"Collage & Assemblage: One Man Show, 1981,\\" New Art Examiner, January 1982. Drought in Paradise, Bernal, 1974 \\"Although Bernal and his family didn't realize it, the first signs of Parkinson's disease began to appear during the 1980s, and he was eventually diagnosed in 1993. [However,] ...he continued to work, to move forward and fight back against the ravages of the disease[.] ... In 2004, Bernal [proposed] to the National Parkinson Foundation [in Miami, Florida] ... to donate a number of his paintings, which would be auctioned to benefit the foundation. Bernal's tremendous contribution ... expanded to some 300 works of art.\\" Bernal's work is annotated in two books by Dorothy Chaplik on Latin American art: Latin American Arts and Cultures and Defining Latin American Art/Hacia una definici√≥n del arte latinoamericanoDorothy Chaplik, \\"Latin American Arts and Cultures,\\" Davis Publications, Inc., Chapter 7: The Modern World, p.112. \\"Defining Latin American Art/Hacia una definici√≥n del arte latinoamericano,\\" McFarland & Co., Inc., Publishers, pp. 96-97\\\\. but in her essay The Art of Jos√© Bernal she discusses Bernal's oeuvre, as well as describes Bernal's artistic process as he traversed life's challenges, including political unrest in Cuba, his personal battle with Parkinson's disease, and his passion for his art. Bernal died of complications from Parkinson's disease on April 19, 2010, at his home in Skokie, Illinois.

Some accept the scientific evidence at face value, some seek to harmonize the Big Bang with their religious tenets, and some reject or ignore the evidence for the Big Bang theory. Background The Big Bang itself is a scientific theory and as such stands or falls by its agreement with observations. However, as a theory which addresses the nature of the universe since its earliest discernible existence, the Big Bang carries possible theological implications regarding the concept of creation out of nothing. Many atheist philosophers have argued against the idea of the Universe having a beginning ‚Äì the Universe might simply have existed for all eternity, but with the emerging evidence of the Big Bang theory, many theologians and physicists have viewed it as implying theism; a popular philosophical argument for the existence of God known as the Kalam cosmological argument rests in the concepts of the Big Bang. In the 1920s and 1930s, almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal steady state universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady-state theory, who rejected the implication that the universe had a beginning. Hinduism The view from the Hindu Puranas is that of an eternal universe cosmology, in which time has no absolute beginning, but rather is infinite and cyclic, rather than a universe which originated from a Big Bang. However, the Encyclop√¶dia of Hinduism, referencing Katha Upanishad 2:20, states that the Big Bang theory reminds humanity that everything came from the Brahman which is \\"subtler than the atom, greater than the greatest.\\" It consists of several \\"Big Bangs\\" and \\"Big Crunches\\" following each other in a cyclical manner. The Nasadiya Sukta, the Hymn of Creation in the Rigveda (10:129), mentions the world beginning from a point or bindu through the power of heat. This can be seen as corresponding to the Big Bang theory. Several prominent modern scientists have remarked that Hinduism (and also Buddhism and Jainism by extension as all three faiths share most of these philosophies) is the only religion (or civilization) in all of recorded history, that has timescales and theories in astronomy (cosmology), that appear to correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology, e.g. Carl Sagan, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schr√∂dinger, Werner Heisenberg, Robert Oppenheimer, George Sudarshan, Fritjof Capra etc. Sir Roger Penrose is among the present- day physicists that believe in a cyclical model for the Universe, wherein there are alternating cycles consisting of Big Bangs and Big Crunches, and he describes this model to be \\"a bit more like Hindu philosophy\\" as compared to the Abrahamic faithshttps://nationalpost.com/news/what-does-the-penrose-big- bang-theory-mean-for-religions/. Christianity At the November 22, 1951, opening meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Pope Pius XII declared that the Big Bang theory does not conflict with the Catholic concept of creation. , citing Some Conservative Protestant Christian denominations have also welcomed the Big Bang theory as supporting a historical interpretation of the doctrine of creation; however, adherents of Young Earth creationism, who advocate a very literal interpretation of the Book of Genesis, tend to reject the theory. Bah√° º√≠ Faith Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h, the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, has taught that the universe has \\"neither beginning nor ending\\". In the Tablet of Wisdom (\\"Lawh-i-Hikmat\\", written 1873‚Äì1874). Bah√°'u'll√°h states: ‚ÄúThat which hath been in existence had existed before, but not in the form thou seest today. The world of existence came into being through the heat generated from the interaction between the active force and that which is its recipient. These two are the same, yet they are different.‚Äù The terminology used here refers to ancient Greek and Islamic philosophy (al-Kindi, Avicenna, Fakhr al- Din al-Razi and Shaykh Ahmad).Rafati, Vahid. Lawh-i-Hikmat: The Two Agents and the Two Patients. \`Andalib, vol. 5, no. 19, pp. 29-38. In an early text, Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h describes the successive creation of the four natures heat and cold (the active force), dryness and moisture (the recipients), and the four elements fire, air, water and earth. About the phrase \\"That which hath been in existence had existed before, but not in the form thou seest today,\\" 'Abdu'l-Bah√° has stated that it means that the universe is evolving. He also states that \\"the substance and primary matter of contingent beings is the ethereal power, which is invisible and only known through its effects... Ethereal matter is itself both the active force and the recipient... it is the sign of the Primal Will in the phenomenal world... The ethereal matter is, therefore, the cause, since light, heat, and electricity appear from it. It is also the effect, for as vibrations take place in it, they become visible...\\". Jean-Marc Lepain, Robin Mihrshahi, Dale E. Lehman and Julio Savi suggest a possible relation of this statement with the Big Bang theory.Lepain, Jean-Marc (2015) [2002]. The Archeology of the Kingdom of God.Lehman, Dale E. (2005). Cosmology and the Bah√° º√≠ Writings . Islam Writing for the Kyoto Bulletin of Islamic Area Studies, Haslin Hasan and Ab. Hafiz Mat Tuah wrote that modern scientific ideas on cosmology are creating new ideas on how to interpret the Quran's cosmogonical terms. In particular, some modern-day Muslim groups have advocated for interpreting the term al-sama, traditionally believed to be a reference to both the sky and the seven heavens, as instead referring to the universe as a whole. Mirza Tahir Ahmad, head of the Ahmadiyya community, asserted in his book Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth that the Big Bang theory was foretold in the Quran. He referenced the verse 30 of the S≈´rat al-AnbiyƒÅ º, which ostensibly mentions the initial singularity: This view that the Qu'ran references the initial singularity of the Big Bang is also accepted by many Muslim scholars outside of the Ahmadiyya community such as Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, who is a Sufi scholar, and Muhammad Asad, who was a nondenominational Muslim scholar. Further, some scholars such as Faheem Ashraf of the Islamic Research Foundation International, Inc. and Sheikh Omar Suleiman of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research argue that the scientific theory of an expanding universe is described in S≈´rat adh-DhƒÅriyƒÅt: References Further reading * Leeming, David Adams, and Margaret Adams Leeming, A Dictionary of Creation Myths.

The center is notable in that it was the prior site of a historic airport, Bernard's Airport, where many of the early aircraft innovations of the 1920s and 1930s occurred. Cedar Hills Crossing has been in operation since 1969, and is located approximately between the intersection of SW Cedar Hills Boulevard and Walker Road and the intersection of SW Cedar Hills Boulevard and Hall Boulevard. The current name was adopted in September 2002 when C.E. John Company began the redevelopment of the Mall. Three extra mall entrances, new building facades and of new retail space was involved in the redevelopment, including new restaurants and interior designs.Harrington, Patrick (October 10, 2002). \\"Mall changing its look, identity and access routes\\".

However, eight species of Huitaca, 17 species of Metagovea and 12 species of Neogovea are currently awaiting description. Name The name is a combination of Ancient Greek neo \\"new\\" and Ogoveidae, a previously described family of Cyphophthalmi that is closely related to Neogoveidae. Description Neogoveidae are 1 to 4.5 mm long and eyeless. They often exhibit a solea (modified area with a high concentration of sensory setae) on the first pair of tarsi. Their chelicerae are smooth, with a dorsal crest and ventral process, and can be either short and robust or long and antennuate. They possess laterally projecting ozophores, tarsal claws on the second pair of legs with a row of teeth, tarsal claws on the third and fourth pairs of legs often with small pegs, and an inconspicuous or absent opisthosomal median furrow. The adenostyle is variable, and can be lamelliform, fimbriate, or digitiform. They exhibit both the fusion of coxae 2 and 3, and the fusion of sternites 8 and 9 with tergite 9, the latter of which forms a complete corona analis, which is not present in the genus Metasiro. Exocrine gland pores are located on the sternum in most genera, except Canga and Neogovea, in which they are absent, and Metasiro, in which they are located on the anal plate. The dorsal scutum is heavily granulated, the metatarsi of the legs are ornamented, and the structure of the spermatopositor is highly variable across genera. Distribution Neogoveidae occur in tropical regions between 10¬∞ north and 5¬∞ south of the equator in both South America and West Africa, with the exception of Metasiro, which is found in southeastern United States. Current research suggests that the diversity of neotropical Neogovidae is much higher than currently known, as new species were found at virtually every place where samples were taken. Currently, the greatest amount of known Neogoveid diversity is known from Colombia, although it is unknown if this reflects greater ecosystem diversity or greater sampling efforts in that country. It is thought that Neogoveidae possesses a considerably large amount of undescribed diversity compared to most other Cyphophthalmi families. A recent phylogeographical study of Metasiro suggests that, as the genus exists at endpoints of large watersheds, mite harvestmen may be able to disperse by utilizing moving bodies of water. Relationships Molecular studies suggest that the South American species are paraphyletic, with the North American Metasiro forming a sister group to all other Neogoveids, Canga forming a sister group to the African Parogovia, and the rest of the South American genera forming a clade. The family is believed to form a sister group relationship with the West African family Ogoveidae. Together, these 2 families make up the superfamily Ogoveoidea, which is the sister group to Troglosironidae. Troglosironidae and Ogoveoidea together make up the infraorder Sternophthalmi, which is well supported as monophyletic by recent phylogenetic analyses. The species Shearogovea mexasca was formerly included in the genus Neogovea, but has since been removed from both the genus and the family, and its taxonomic position within Cyphophthalmi is uncertain. It has been proposed, however, that the species be re-included within Neogoveidae, and that Metasiro be excluded from the family.

The campus occupies about of land and includes several academic buildings as well as various athletic fields. The school's motto is \\"Mens Sana in Corpore Sano\\" (A Healthy Mind In A Healthy Body). Erskine Academy's school colors are blue and white, and an eagle is the school's mascot. History Erskine was founded as a result of a trust established following the passing of Sullivan Erskine in 1880. John K. Erskine, a nephew of Sullivan, asked Mary Erskine to bequest a portion of the money to the town of China to be placed in some reliable trust, the annual interest to be used to support and control a high school for the town. This school was to be located in school district No. 14. In this, John Erskine saw a chance by which his dream of a life-time might be realized. In his own youth he had been denied the privilege of a high school education, and he made up his mind that if opportunity ever came his way he would see that the younger generation had this chance. Mr. Erskine went about his work so quietly and yet so openly that even his closest friends and associates did not realize his great influence and interest in the business at hand. A body of trustees was established and they went to Augusta, and proceeded to enlist the services of attorneys, Samuel Titcomb, W.S. Choate and Mr. Boardman, editor of the Maine Farmer. These in consultation, drew up a deed of trust that established the school. This being done, the trustees met and organized, choosing Eli Jones, president; J.K. Erskine, vice-president; Dana C. Hanson, secretary, and Samuel C. Starrett, treasurer. The school then secured a building from an old Methodist Church and opened in 1883. Tuition at Erskne Academy is $12,650 a year for non boarding students and $13,650 boarding.

Her mother was a professional dancer and her father was a conductor. Therefore, she had the opportunity to tour the world with them when they were performing abroad. In the first episodes, she was quite snobbish and reserved. So she had difficulty in making friends. But, throughout the episodes, she became a close friend of Ingrid and Lola. She has had many lovers: Pedro, Rober (who eventually got her pregnant), Pavel, cocaine addict Alvaro, and Horacio (an ex-boyfriend of her aunt's). Dolores \\"Lola\\" Fern√°ndez (Beatriz Luengo) is a young woman who has devoted her entire life to dance and her family (her father and younger brother). She has a talent for singing but her real passion is dancing. Throughout the episodes, she has had many lovers: Jer√≥nimo, Pavel (played by Orishas‚Äô frontman Yotuel who is also Beatriz Luengo's partner in real life), and Pedro. Ingrid Mu√±oz (Silvia Marty) is an extroverted and optimistic young woman who idolises Aretha Franklin. She had a romance with Juan, one of her teachers. She broke up with him, however, after he got his colleague Diana pregnant. Pedro Salvador (Pablo Puyol) is the son of an Asturian fisherman and he moved to Madrid to learn how to dance. Actually, he considers dance as a way to overcome his shyness towards girls. Besides, he has to work at part-time jobs in order to pay for his scholarship. Roberto Rober Arenales (Miguel √Ångel Mu√±oz) is the seventh son of a wealthy family from San Sebastian. He likes behaving as a tough guy, and he‚Äôs a ladies' man. He has a son, with an ex girlfriend from when he was 16. Jeronimo ‚ÄúJero‚Äù Juiz (Raul Pe√±a), is a songwriter ready to do anything to gain fame. He had a romance with Lola but she ended up cheating on him with another student, Pavel. Marta Ramos (Dafne Fern√°ndez) is a classical dancer. She is dance teacher Adela's sister. She had an affair with Pedro, and afterwards, with Rober. In the final season, she was diagnosed with a heart disease. But, eventually, she overcame it and returned to dance.

It was revived as a modern festival in 1946. The tournament event takes place in June (1st Challenge) during a Saturday night and September (the counter-challenge) the 2nd or 3rd Sunday of September, and is proceeded each time by a festival with a 17th- century costumed parade. Historical The definition of Quintana comes from the 5th road of the Roman military camps, where the soldiers were trained in lance fighting. They would run against a dummy-soldier, trying to catch a ring hanging from an arm of the dummy. This is the origin of the tournament's name, but the first definition and documented \\"Quintana\\" as a knights' jousting tournament during a festival, dates back to 1448. In 1613 the build-up to the Quintana tournament included the carnival festivals we see today. Modern In 1946 the actual \\"Giostra della Quintana\\" was reborn. There are ten knights, each representing a quarter of the Town, and each with a distinctive flag. The knights gallop on horseback at high speed around a figure-of-eight shaped track, and must spear three rings. At each round of the competition the rings get smaller, requiring more precision with the lance. The rings hang from a rotating statue in the centre of the stadium. The oak statue dates back to 1613, and represents Mars \\"God of War\\" from ancient Greek mythology. It holds a shield with the symbol of Foligno, and the ring is attached on an outstretched arm ready to be speared. Over the Quintana weekend a number of festivities take place involving the whole town, including a parade with 800 characters dressed in 17th century costume on the day before the Ring Joust.

Later, as 2nd Fighter Air Base it was put under the newly established Air Defence Corps and its squadron was named \\"Wild Cat\\". Gabrovnitsa Air Base was the main air defence asset of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant at Kozloduy right until its deactivation.  3rd Fighter Air Base (Graf Ignatievo)  Graf Ignatievo Air Base used to house the 19th Fighter Air Regiment (flying MiG-21s) of the 10th Combined Air Corps. Later the corps was transformed into Tactical Air Command and the 19th FAR was transferred to Air Defence Corps as 3rd Fighter Air Base. Today it is the sole active Fighter Air Base of the BAF with two squadrons, one of which is the MiG-29 \\"Sharks\\" squadron of the deactivated 5th FAB - Ravnets.  4th Fighter Air Base (Uzundzhovo)  Uzundzhovo Air Base, near the city of Haskovo, used to house a fighter air regiment and after its disbandment became a squadron of the 19th Fighter Air Regiment (HQ at Graf Ignatievo). When the 19th FAR was transformed into 3rd FAB and shifted to ADC Uzundzhovo went along as an independent unit: the 4th Fighter Air Base. Shortly afterwards it changed tasks and hats transferring to the Tactical Air Command as 21st Fighter-Bomber Air Base and finally disbanded.  5th Fighter Air Base (Ravnets)  Ravnets Air Base, near the Black Sea coast city of Burgas, housed a squadron (flying MiG-21s, later MiG-29s) of the 17th Fighter Air Regiment - an integral part of the 2nd Air Defence Division. Later, as 5th Fighter Air Base it was put under the newly established Air Defence Corps and its squadron was named \\"Sharks\\"(although unofficially, but still because of its patch and its geographical location close to the sea this is how it used to be called). The base was considered elite because of its proximity to the Turkish border and its task to protect the oil refinery near Burgas, which is deemed of strategical importance to the country. That is the reason for the squadron to be the first (and only) transiting to the MiG-29. As the base deactivated the air unit was moved to Graf Ignatievo, where it is currently residing as 2nd Squadron of the 3rd Fighter Air Base.  6th Fighter Air Base (Balchik)  Balchik Air Base housed a squadron (flying MiG-21s) of the 17th Fighter Air Regiment - an integral part of the 2nd Air Defence Division. Later, as 6th Fighter Air Base it was put under the newly established Air Defence Corps. As the base de-activated its MiG-21bis/ UM fighters were transferred to the 26th Reconnaissance Air Base. Today the base is rarely used for para-training and sea survival courses. Currently 6th Aviation Material Preservation Base.  11th Training Air Base (Shtraklevo)  Shtraklevo Air Base housed between two and four training squadrons, flying Aero L-29s as 1st Training Air Regiment of the Higher Military Aviation School. Later the regiment was transformed into 11th Training Air Base and de-activated. Currently 11th Aviation Material Preservation Base.  12th Training Air Base (Kamenets)  Kamenets (now transferred to Dolna Mitropoliya) housed the 2nd Training Air Regiment of the Higher Military Aviation School, flying MiG-21s, L-29s and Aero L-39s. Later it was transformed into 12th Training Air Base and became part of Tactical Air Command. Today it has just been moved to its former location of Dolna Mitropolija and it flies a squadron of Pilatus PC-9Ms and a squadron of L-39s.  16th Transport Air Base (Vrazhdebna)  Vrazhdebna Air Base (military area of Sofia Airport) housed the 16th Transport Air Regiment, which transformed into 16th Transport Air Base (but popularly the base is still called \\"trap\\" - the acronym of the regiment). It houses the 1st Air Transport Squadron, flying Antonov An-26s, Let L-410s, and a sole Pilatus PC-12. The An-26s are flown to important assignments in support of Bulgarian units, contributing to missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Iraq and recently to Afghanistan. The squadron is to acquire the first of the ordered Alenia C-27J Spartans in a couple of months.  21st Fighter-Bomber Air Base (Uzundzhovo)  Uzundzhovo Air Base (formerly 4th FAB) used to house a fighter air regiment and after its disbandment became a squadron of the 19th Fighter Air Regiment (HQ at Graf Ignatievo). When the 19th FAR was transformed into 3rd FAB and shifted to ADC Uzundzhovo went along as an independent unit: the 4th Fighter Air Base. Shortly afterwards it changed tasks and hats transferring to the Tactical Air Command as 21st Fighter-Bomber Air Base and finally disbanded.  22nd Ground Attack Air Base (Bezmer)  Bezmer Air Base (becoming a joint Bulgarian- American training facility) housed the 22nd Ground Attack Air Regiment (flying Sukhoi Su-25s), which was part of the 10th Combined Air Corps. When the corps transformed into Tactical Air Command the 22nd Ground Attack Air Base transitioned to the new structure. After 26th RAB - Dobrich was de-activated its squadron, flying the dedicated recon planes - the Su-22M-4/UM-3K was transferred to Bezmer where it very briefly operated as an Air Reconnaissance Flight before it disbanded a little more than a year later. Today the 22nd GAAB has two squadrons: 1st Squadron (called \\"Rattlesnake\\" or as its patch says \\"Crotale\\") and 2nd Squadron (called unofficially \\"The Khans\\", because of the traditional Bulgarian insignias of its ancient rulers it has in its patch). The base took intensively part in every joint exercise at home and abroad, held until the time of its establishment.  23rd Attack Helicopters Air Base (Stara Zagora)  Stara Zagora Air Base used to house the 13th Attack Helicopters Air Regiment (flying 44 Mil Mi-24, of which 6 were of the \\"V\\" version and the remainder of the \\"D\\") of the 10th Combined Air Corps. As The corps transformed into Tactical Air Command, so did the regiment, becoming an air base. In the late 1990s it disbanded, sending one squadron to the 24th Helicopter Air Base and disestablishing the other one.  24th Helicopter Air Base (Krumovo)  Krumovo Air Base (military area of Plovdiv Airport) used to house the 44th Helicopter Air Regiment (flying Mil Mi-17s, Mil Mi-8s and Mil Mi-2s) of the 10th Combined Air Corps. According to the major restructuring plans, it became an air base and when 23rd AHAB disbanded, one of its squadrons became 2nd Attack Helicopter Squadron of the 24th HAB. The 1st Helicopter Squadron flies the Mi-17s and the 2nd Helicopter Squadron flies the 12 Eurocopter AS 532AL Cougars delivered from 2006 to 2009. The Bell 206B-3s that were acquired at the end of the 1990s form an Independent Helicopter Training Flight. 24th Helicopter Air Base is also the unit of the armed forces in constant readiness to react upon natural or industrial disasters, providing evacuation or providing emergency response units with air mobility. CSAR activities are also being developed. For that reason, a specialised unit is based at Krumovo, composed of PARA-SAR/CSAR operators, who are exclusively former servicemen of the 68th Special Forces Brigade, based nearby. Emphasis in their training is put on parachute jumps, alpine skills and MEDEVAC knowledge. A major boost in that kind of operations will occur when the last four AS.532AL arrive. Those will be dedicated CSAR machines, equipped with top-notch sensors and gear.  25th Fighter-Bomber Air Base (Cheshnegirovo)  Cheshnegirovo Air Base/Sadovo used to house the 25th Fighter-Bomber Air Regiment (flying MiG-23BN/UBs) of the 10th Combined Air Corps. According to the major restructuring plans it became the first regiment to convert to an air base structure. Briefly it housed the entire Bulgarian MiG-23 fleet after which it disbanded.  26th Reconnaissance Air Base (Dobrich)  Dobrich Air Base used to house the 26th Reconnaissance Air Regiment (flying MiG-21Rs/ PFM- Rs/ bis, Su-22M-4/ UM-3Ks and for some time the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25R/U of the 10th Combined Air Corps. Later it became an air base with two squadrons. When Balchik AB de-activated its MiG-21bis/ UMs were transferred to the 26th RAB. After it also ceased operating, its Su-22s were sent to the 22nd GAAB at Bezmer.  Bozhurishte Airfield  For a long time Bozhurishte Airfield has been the most important asset and a symbol of the Bulgarian aviation, housing military and civil flying activity, as well as aircraft production. A very inspiring sign stood over the entrance of the airfield during the 1920s and 1930s saying: \\"At that field we learn how to sacrifice ourselves for King and Motherland!\\" During the Second World War it has been the major Bulgarian Air Troops base and housed a number of air combat units in addition to the Air Troops Headquarters. At a time the greater number of air force units and aircraft were concentrated at Bozhurishte. After the introduction of jet combat aircraft the airfield became a major command and maintenance base for the missile air defence and early warning and control units of the country, the most important resident units being the 1st Missile Air Defence Brigade and the 1st Radio-Technical Brigade of the 1st AD Division. It is no longer a significant military facility and the future plans for it are not known. In sharp contrast with the legendary past of the airfield today it is a reason for a huge scandal, which is rapidly gaining momentum. According to a deal struck by the Ministry of Defence the airfield will most probably be destroyed to give space for a business center.  Plovdiv  The city of Plovdiv used to house the headquarters of the Tactical Aviation Command and is still a place of significance as it houses a number of logistical and operational support units of the Bulgarian Air Force. The 2nd Missile Air Defence Brigade is also based in the vicinities of the city and is responsible for the air defence of the central part of the country.  Burgas  The city of Burgas is the place around which the 3rd Missile Air Defence Brigade of the Bulgarian Air Force is deployed, providing counter air protection of the country's eastern area, the navy and the Bourgas Oil Refinery.  63rd Independent Maritime Helicopter Air Base at Varna (Chaika)  The Chayka Naval Air Base at Varna houses the Independent Maritime Helicopter Squadron - the Bulgarian Fleet Air Arm. Currently it flies Mil Mi-14s and is awaiting AS.565MBs which are on order.

Extended techniques and instruments Many of his works utilize unusual instrumentations, extended techniques or theatrical setups. For Tempest in a Teapot, commissioned by the Dutch Music Days for the Radio Kamer Philharmonic, the orchestra is spatialized around the public. As winner of the Harvey Gaul competition from the Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble, he composed Sound becomes visible in the form of radiance, which is built around the bowing of a piano: ‚Äúa radical work that reorients the listener's relationship to time.‚Äù (Mark Kanny, Pittsburgh Tribune) His recent set of six pi√®ces m√©caniques for Calefax and Eric Vloeimans consists mostly of text directions and staging diagrams. Also McGowan composed the world's first Concerto for iPad (tablet computer) and orchestra, which saw its premiere with soloist Keiko Shichijo and the Rotterdam Sinfonia, conducted by Conrad van Alphen. Upcoming performances are scheduled for the Netherlands and Belgium. Flute When playing the flute, Ned focuses mainly on creative projects and he has collaborated with Aka Moon, Derek Bermel, Gabriel Bolkosky, George Brooks, Oguz Buyukberber, Larry Coryell, Oene van Geel, Stephen Gosling, Dr. Marshall Griffith, Wiek Hijmans, Rozalie Hirs, Guus Janssen, David Kweksilber, Dr. Gregory Oakes, Erkan Ogur, Keiko Shichijo, Fahrettin Yarkƒ±n, mime-ist Virag Dezso and Zapp 4 in addition to many renowned Indian artists. He has also performed with the musikFabrik, Beethoven Academie, the Erie Philharmonic, Aspen Contemporary Ensemble, Non Sequitur, Axyz Ensemble, Spinifex Orchestra and his own quintet Hexnut. His specialty is also the contrabass flute, where he often performs solo and in 2008 he composed the first concerto for contrabass flute and orchestra. Premiered at Carnegie Hall with the American Composers Orchestra, he ‚Äúproved there‚Äôs still plenty of life in old-fashioned virtuosity with Bantammer Swing, a playful, athletic concerto for his unwieldy contrabass flute,\\" according to Steve Smith of the New York Times. He has composed often for flute and also for recorder in solo and chamber ensembles, and will compose both the competition piece for the National Flute Convention High School Soloist Competition in 2016 and a work for piccolo specialist Ilonka Kolthof. India One strong facet of Ned's influence is the Carnatic music from South India. Over the past decade he has collaborated and performed regularly in India and Europe with Indian musicians Pravin Godkhindi, Jahnavi Jayaprakash, Ronu Majumdar, Dr. Mysore Manjunath, B.C. Manjunath, Mysore Nagaraj, M.K. Pranesh, Dr. Suma Sudhindra, Anoor Anathakrishna Sharma and Ghiridar Udupa. ‚ÄúWhat fascinates me is the Carnatic use of rhythmical complexities developed through a tradition of performance.‚Äù Works exploring Indian forms from a European perspective include Chamundi Hill, for flute and harp, Alap for voice and ensemble, Stone Soup for jazz ensemble, Tusk for ensemble and Three Amsterdam Scenes for voice, viola and keyboards. New works The festivals Acht Br√ºcken, Grachten, Klankkleur Festivals, MATA, Nederlandse Muziek Dagen, Voorwaarts Maart have commissioned new works from McGowan and his music has been performed at Aspen, Gaudeamus, Dag in de Branding, North Sea Jazz, November Music, SinusTon, Huddersfield, Klap op de Vuurpijl festivals. Other current commissions include a third work for Calefax and works for the Slagwerk Den Haag, viola soloist Kimberly Sparr and music for a radio play for the NTR.

It is the \\"leading public critic\\"Head count: Prison Policy Initiative of the United States Census Bureau's practice of counting prisoners as residents of the towns where they are incarcerated, and has conducted research in several states proving that this practice results in distortion of equal representation. The Prison Policy Initiative's publications include \\"Importing Constituents: Prisoners and Political Clout in New York\\", \\"Why the Census Bureau can and must start collecting the home addresses of incarcerated people\\", and \\"Phantom constituents in the Empire State: How outdated Census Bureau methodology burdens New York counties\\". It has also published the Democracy Toolkit , an internet tool designed for rural democracy activists, allowing them to use PPI's research procedures to study their own communities. Census work PPI published the first empirical, district-by-district analysis of the effects of Census Bureau methodology which counts prisoners as residents of towns containing prisons, not their pre-incarceration addresses, and has since been the leading critic of the practice (which it calls \\"prisoner miscount\\") and the distortion of equal representation it causes. Executive director Peter Wagner has testified on the issue before the National Academies and the New York State Legislative Task Force on Demographic Research and Apportionment. The Census Bureau's scientific advisors at the United States National Research Council have now recommended that the Bureau begin to collect prisoners' home address information, and the New York Times editorial board has repeatedly supported PPI's calls for reform.In the News Prison Policy Initiative Once an unknown issue, the problem of prisoner miscount has now been identified as \\"the most controversial issue for the 2010 census.\\"No prison like home Prison and jail telephone industry PPI's two reports on the prison and jail phone industry explain why the industry must be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. The reports explain that prison phone bills are so high because of a unique market failure: prison systems and local jails award monopoly contracts to the phone company that will charge the highest rates and share as much as 84% of the profits with the facility.The Price To Call Home: State-Sanctioned Monopolization In The Prison Phone Industry The real customers, the families paying the hefty bills, are left entirely out of the decision-making process. In fact, both parties to these contracts profit from disregarding the interests of the actual consumers of prison telephone services. Aside from the high rates, fees also have an enormous impact on prison phone bills, making up 38% of the $1 billion annual price of calling home.

In South America, muleskinners transport coffee, maize (corn), cork, wheat and myriad other items. They remain common in the Paisa Region (Antioquia and the Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis) of Colombia. In California, muleteers work out of pack stations. In Europe, there are still muleteers in the south of Portugal and the southwest of Spain, in the cork producing area. Their role is now limited to transporting the cork with their mules, out of the Mediterranean oak forest to more accessible routes, where modern means of transport are available. Names and etymology The English word muleteer comes from the French muletier, from Old French, from mulet, diminutive of mul, mule. The term muleskinner means someone who can \\"skin\\", or outsmart, a mule. The Spanish word arriero is derived from the verb arrear, which means to urge cattle or other stock to walk. The verb itself is derived from arre, which is the call used to cry out to animals for this purpose. In English, an arriero is one type of muleteer, a wrangler of pack animals. The Catalan word traginer comes from the Latin word tragƒ´nare, a variant of tragƒïre which means \\"to transport\\". Arrieros (1836) by Carl Nebel; three Mexican muleteers attempting to move a heavily loaded mule Outfits Typical muleteer outfits vary from country to country: *Carriel: Leather bag traditionally made of nutria leather. It is used to carry personal goods and money. It has become an element of the Colombian fashion. *Espadrilles (alpargatas) : Sandals made of fique (natural fiber obtained of furcraea plants and leather. *Machete *Poncho: Rectangular piece of fabric, usually white with linear embroidery, that is used to protect the face and neck from the cold weather. *Ruana: Square wool garment, larger than the poncho, with a hole in the middle for the head. It covers the torso. *Straw hat (sombrero aguade√±o) *Tapapinche: Leather apron. In popular culture The fictional Juan Valdez, brand representative of the Federaci√≥n Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia, is an archetypal muleteer carrying coffee sacks with his mule. In Cormac McCarthy's second Border Trilogy novel, The Crossing, Billy's wolf upsets the muleteers' burros, which wreaks substantial havoc before Billy moves on. \\"Mule Skinner Blues\\" is a country music song first recorded in 1930 by Jimmy Rodgers, which has inspired many subsequent variations. The 1964 Broadway musical Man of La Mancha features a band of muleteers as one of the primary antagonists.

The vowels in the name are pronounced as in the English words tape and pea. Located in the Sheka Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region (SNNPR), this town has a latitude and longitude of with a mean elevation of 1,097 meters above sea level. The town is said to be named after a Majangir man who once had a bee hive in the large tree that stood in the marketplace.Unseth, Peter. 2010. Tepi. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, vol. 4, p. 920, edited by Siegbert Uhlig. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz  Overview  Tepi hosts an airport (ICAO code TIE IATA code HATP) with a long, smooth but unpaved runway, the destination of scheduled flights by Ethiopian Airlines since the 1960s. Since 1966, the town has had a medical clinic and the same year the road to Tepi was improved. Electricity became available in 1984. The town also has postal service. This town has long been a market and commercial center for the area. Construction of all-weather roads were begun in the late 1970s, and by 1988 they extended from Tepi in three directions: south to Mizan Teferi (built with Cuban help), southeast to Shishinda (toward Bonga), and north to Gore. An elementary school was begun in Tepi about the time the Italians left, and the town has had a high school since about 1980. In 2009 Mizan Tepi University opened its Faculty of Engineering and Science in Tepi. Near the city is the Tepi Coffee Plantation Project, which is the second- largest coffee plantation in Ethiopia covering 6,205 hectares. Run by the state, it produces over 2,500 tonnes of raw arabica beans each year. The surrounding area is very hilly and was densely forested. The area claims to be Ethiopia‚Äôs center for turmeric, and also exports cardamom, ginger, corn, honey, beeswax, timber, sugar cane, bananas, mangoes, and other fruit. Due to the fly-borne disease trypanosomiasis, cattle do poorly in the area, so none are used for plowing. The disease also prevents equines (horses, donkeys, and mules) from being raised there. The town has Ethiopian Orthodox churches, a mosque, and Protestant churches. There is also a strong following of a local spirit cult following Bulafo and Ginabo. Northeast of the town is an inactive shield volcano 2728 meters in height, which volcanologists call Tepi.Global Volcanism Program Tepi Summary  History  People report that there had been a small Italian military presence there during World War II. The countryside around Tepi has long been multiethnic, including significant numbers of Majangir, Shakacho, Sheko, Kafficho, and Oromo. Most of the city's residents (or their parents) are from other parts of Ethiopia, adding even more ethnic groups to the mix.Sarah Vaughan, \\"Ethnicity and Power in Ethiopia\\" (University of Edinburgh: Ph.D. Thesis, 2003), pp. 272ff In the 1980s, because of famine, many people from other provinces were resettled nearby. These acts have led to conflicts under ethnic federalism, since no ethnic group comprises a majority. There has been occasional armed conflict in the area since 1991, involving people from the surrounding area dividing along ethnic lines. In March 2002 between 600 and 800 persons were killed during clashes between the Majangir, Sheko, and Bench-Maji in and around the town of Tepi. Government officials reported 128 deaths; however, the Southern Ethiopia People's Democratic Coalition reported more than 1,700 deaths. More than 2,000 homes were destroyed and 5,800 persons were displaced as a result of the violence. The clashes involved local officials and members of each of these communities, and resulted from the dissatisfaction of many Sheko and Majangir who had wanted autonomy following an unsuccessful attempt in 1993 to move the Shekecho Zone from the SNNPR to the Gambela Region. While the Federal Government claimed to have arrested 41 policemen, 39 militia members, and 11 administrative officials for their participation in the clashes, it refused to allow an independent investigation of the incident and put the Federal Police in charge of the government's internal investigation.\\"Ethiopia: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: 2002 report\\", Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, US State Department (accessed 9 July 2009) One campus of the new Mizan - Tepi University is located in Tepi.

The pine‚Äìoak forests are surrounded by tropical dry forests at lower elevations to the west, northwest, and south; the Jalisco dry forests to the west and southwest; the Balsas dry forests to the south, in the basin of the Balsas River, and the Baj√≠o dry forests to the northwest, in the basin of the Rio Grande de Santiago and the lower Rio Lerma. The Central Mexican matorral lies to the north of the range in the high basins of the Plateau, including the Valley of Mexico and the upper reaches of the Lerma around Toluca. The Tehuacan valley matorral lies in the rain shadow valley to the southeast in Puebla and Tlaxcala states. To the east, the moist Veracruz montane forests and Oaxacan montane forests are the transition between the pine‚Äìoak forests and the lowland tropical forests along the Gulf of Mexico. Pockets of montane grassland and shrubland can be found among the pine‚Äìoak forests, and constitute a separate ecoregion, the Zacatonal. Flora The chief plant communities are pine forests, pine‚Äìoak forests, oak forests, pine‚Äìcedar forests, and pine‚Äìfir forests. The plant communities vary with elevation and rainfall. Pine forests are generally found between 2,275 and 2,600 m. Pine‚Äìoak forests occur between 2,470 and 2,600 m. Pine‚Äìcedar forests can be found above 2,700 m. Pine‚Äìfir forests occur above 3000 m. In the pine forests, Montezuma pine (Pinus montezumae) is generally predominant, with smooth-bark Mexican pine (P. pseudostrobus) predominant in more humid areas, and Hartweg's pine (P. hartwegii) and P. tecote in dry areas with shallow soils. Pine‚Äìfir forests are composed almost entirely of Hartweg's pine (Pinus hartwegii) and sacred fir (Abies religiosa).

He was born in Wrexham, the eldest son of Richard Myddleton Massie Lloyd of Plas Power, Bersham, a wealthy Mercer (Welsh flannel,linen, wool and cloth dealer) and later, a Banker, and Mary Bowey, the daughter of William Bowey (1725-1820), of Chester, Cheshire. He was educated at Ruthin School. In 1798, he obtained a commission in the army of the Honourable East India Company, and landing in India a year later, with the Rank of Lieutenant. He later became Captain in the Bengal Infantry, commanding the Residency Escort at Nagpore for 14 years. In 1814, he inherited the Bryn Estyn estate, Bieston, Wrexham, and other lands and property in Denbighshire, following his fathers death, while his brother, Richard Myddleton Massie Lloyd (1794-1860), took over the running of the Wrexham & North Wales Bank, which was set up by his father in Ty Meredith, Chester Street, Wrexham. In 1817, he was wounded four times at the Battle of Seetabuldee, and took part in the Siege of Nagpore in December that year. He had a son, George who was born 17 October 1815 in India, and a daughter, Mary was born 4 January 1817, to an unnamed Indian mother. In 1822 he began a journey through the Himalayas that took him as far as Buran Ghati on the Tibetan border, where he produced maps for the EIC, which were of such fine quality, they are still used by the Indian military. On 13 June, he set off alone and later that day, he became the first European to reach the peak of the Western Hill of Boorendo. In 1829, he became High Sheriff of Denbighshire. During December 1830, in his role as Captain of the Denbighshire Hussars Imperial Yeomanry, William Lloyd played a prominent role in diffusing an ugly situation in Rhosllanerchgugog that had arisen between the striking miners of Cefn, Acrefair, Rhosllanerchgugog and Brymbo, which became known as known as 'The Battle of Cinder Hill'. In November 1837, Captain William Lloyd played a role in the management of 'The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge' and was a distinguished member of one of the S. D. U. K's. local committee's at Wrexham. In Queen Victoria's first honours list, he was created a Knight Bachelor on 18 July 1838. Also in 1838, Major Sir William Lloyd was gazetted to the command of the Denbighshire Hussars Imperial Yeomany, with the rank of Major Commander, when Colonel Sir Watkin Williams Wynn retired. In 1840, he published his journals as 'The Narrative of a Journey from Caunpoor to the Boorendo Pass in the Himalayan Mountains Via Gwalior, Agra, Delhi, and Sirhind by Major Sir William Lloyd and Captain Alexander Gerards's Account of an Attempt to Penetrate by Bekhur to Garoo and the Lake Manasarowara: For The Purpose of Determining the Line of Perpetual Snow on the Southern Face of the Himalaya (With Maps)', which was edited by his son, George Lloyd at Bryn Estyn. Following the accidental death of his son in 1843 in Egypt, and the collapse of the family's bank during 1849, Major Sir William Lloyd retired from public life for a few years, spending his time at his villa at Llandudno, 'Plas Trevor'. He died there on 16 May 1857, his body being brought back to Bryn Estyn, before being taken back to Llandudno where he was buried at St Tudno's Churchyard, on the Great Orme, Llandudno.

It consists of an area of 90 km2, 3,910 inhabitants and is 200 m above sea level. There are two main towns are A Pontenova (Galicia) and Taramundi (Asturias). The climate in the region is pleasant throughout the year. As with the rest of northern Spain (or the Green Spain), the climate is more variable than the southern parts of Spain and is characterised by an Atlantic climate. The average temperature in summer is usually around 26 ¬∞C. The average temperature in winter is 8 ¬∞C (12 ¬∞C in the day and 4 ¬∞C at night). The Turia River gives its name to the valley. The valley is surrounded by hills and mountains, including, Sierra de Piedrafita (900 m), Sierra de Ouroso (1033 m), Sierras de Dendin (900 m), Sierra de Teixedais (900 m) and Sierra de Eirua (700 m). UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Also Taramundi is part of the Eo River, Oscos and Buron lands Biosphere Reserve. A Biosphere Reserve is an international conservation designation given by UNESCO under its Programme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB). The World Network of Biosphere Reserves is the collection of all 531 biosphere reserves in 105 countries (as of May, 2008). Biosphere reserves are created to promote and demonstrate a balanced relationship between humans and the biosphere. The area included in the Biosphere Reserve occupies a surface of 158.883 hectares of which 215km2 belongs to the area of the Turia Valley. Agriculture, fish farming and tourism are the principal areas of growth for the region. Although there has been a fall in the primary sector in recent years and an increase in the service sectors as rural tourism, agriculture still remains the largest economical activity of local economy. Micro businesses and family run businesses are very characteristic of the region. Construction, commerce, hotels and rural tourism also account for high percentage of local business. Rural tourism is now a growing activity in all the Reserve, at present there are about 170 establishments catered for rural tourism.  Tur√≠a River  The R√≠o Tur√≠a (\\"Turia River\\") is a small river, 9 km in length and an altitude of 250m above the sea, which rises in the town of Taramundi (Asturias) and drains into the Eo River in the town of A Pontenova (Lugo). The Turia river gives its name to the Turia Valley or ‚ÄúValle del Tur√≠a‚Äù that crosses horizontally before emptying into the Eo river. The Turia river is fed by numerous streams and creeks from the mountains that limit the valley, and is part of the Eo UNESCO biosphere reserve. While the river is born in Asturias, the bulk of his wealth is found in Lugo (Galicia). The Turia river is a source of industry and its waters are used to generate socio-economic activities based on ancient traditions such as Navajeros crafts and textiles, as well as the primary industry of salmon farming in A Pontenova (Lugo). *Source: Near as As Veigas, Taramundi (Asturias). *Ending: R√≠o Eo, Puente Nuevo (Lugo). *Distance: 9 km. *Altitude: 800m - 250m. *Tributary rivers: Small local creeks and streams. *Runs: Asturias: As Veigas, Mazonovo, Taramundi, A Garda y Mousende.

It is based on the memoir by former New York City Mayor Ed Koch and depicts a single day in the life of the city's mayor. The musical ran on Broadway in 1985 after an Off-Broadway run. Overview Real-life personalities who are portrayed in the musical include Cardinal John O'Connor, Bess Myerson, Leona and Harry Helmsley, Carol Bellamy, Harrison J. Goldin, John V. Lindsay, Abraham Beame and Sue Simmons. The play, called an \\"exuberant, witty cabaret revue\\" has a \\"distinctly New York brand of humor and the local political joke\\", according to an article in The Washington Post. The article went on to note several in-jokes, such as \\"the hysterical monologue on the city's absurd ritual of alternate-side parking, whereby owners double-park their cars several hours a day because of street-sweeping rules?\\"Hornblower, Margot. \\"Celebrating Chutzpah\\" The Washington Post, May 14, 1985 Keith Curran, who was in the original cast, (as Harry Helmsley) directed a production of the musical at the Ruth Foreman Theatre West (Sunrise, Florida) in January 1988, saying: \\"It tells 'a sort of morality tale for Koch, like A Christmas Carol... Koch is visited by the spirit of Fiorello LaGuardia and threatened with losing the city. There is a lot of redemption in this show, but it takes a very harsh look at New York and how hard it is to live there.\\"Jack, Carolyn. \\"'Mayor' Finds A Fitting Winter Stay At Foreman West\\" SunSentinel, January 22, 1988 Strouse said that he wanted to write a musical that \\"filtered New York sounds through it.\\" The musical has music \\"alternating contemporary pop with ragtime, jazz and other styles, each carefully chosen to evoke a mood or characterize a class of people illustrative of New York.\\" Production The Off-Broadway production was directed by Jeffrey B.

The Eureka Visitors Center is located in the main hall of the museum. The Clarke Museum is a 501 (c)3 non-profit.  History  The Clarke Historical Museum was founded by Cecile Clarke (1885-1979). Miss Clarke was a local history teacher at Eureka High School. It was here at Eureka High that she first started displaying her collection of local Native American basketry. In 1960, when the school ran out of room for her ever increasing collection of local history items, Miss Clarke sold her family sheep ranch and used the money to buy the old Bank of Eureka building, where she moved her collection. Miss Clarke taught for over 40 years and dedicated her life to the museum. Originally named the Clarke Memorial Museum, after her parents, it was renamed the Clarke Historical Museum in 2001, and now runs as a privately operated non-profit organization for the use, benefit, and awareness of the City of Eureka, surrounding cities and the local Native Indian tribes. The Native American wing, Nealis Hall, was built in 1979.http://www.clarkemuseum.org/about-the-clarke.html The Bank Building The museum is housed in the former Bank of Eureka & Savings Bank of Humboldt Building (1911) in Old Town Eureka, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places both as an individual landmark and as a contributing building to the Eureka Historic District.National Park Service, \\"Eureka Historic District,\\" National Register of Historic Places.

It tells the story of four different African American women. Each of the four characters represents an African-American stereotype in society. Thulani Davis of The Village Voice called the song \\"an instantly accessible analysis of the damning legacy of slavery, that made iconographic the real women we knew and would become.\\" African-American female archetypes *The first of the four women described in the song is \\"Aunt Sarah\\" a character who represents African- American enslavement. Simone's description of the woman emphasizes the strong and resilient aspects of her race, \\"strong enough to take the pain\\" as well as the long-term suffering her race has had to endure, \\"inflicted again and again\\". *The second woman who appears in the song is dubbed \\"Saffronia\\", a woman of mixed race (\\"my skin is yellow\\") forced to live \\"between two worlds\\". She is portrayed as an oppressed woman and her story is once again used to highlight the suffering of the black race at the hands of white people in positions of power (\\"My father was rich and white/He forced my mother late one night\\"). *The third woman is that of a prostitute referred to as \\"Sweet Thing\\". She finds acceptance with both black and white people, not only because \\"my hair is fine\\", but also because she provides sexual gratification (\\"Whose little girl am I?/Anyone who has money to buy\\"). *The fourth and final woman is very tough, embittered by the generations of oppression and suffering endured by her people (\\"I'm awfully bitter these days/'cause my parents were slaves\\"). Simone finally unveils the woman's name after a dramatic finale during which she screams, \\"My name is Peaches!\\" Style Musically speaking the song is based on a simple groove based melody with piano, flute, electric guitar, and bass guitar accompaniment. The song gradually builds in intensity as it progresses, and reaches a climax during the fourth and final section. Simone's vocal becomes more impassioned, cracking with emotion and her steady piano playing becomes frenzied and at times dissonant, possibly to reflect the angst of the character. The song ends with Simone wailing, with ear splitting conviction, the name \\"Peaches\\". Misinterpretation Much to Simone's dismay, and despite her intention to highlight the injustice in society and the suffering of African-American people, some listeners interpreted the song as racist. They believed it drew on black stereotypes, and it was subsequently banned on several major radio stations. Cover versions and uses in popular culture The English blues rock band Black Cat Bones covered the song on their only album, Barbed Wire Sandwich, released in 1969. The song was adapted by filmmaker Julie Dash into a 1978 short experimental film of the same name. Sandra Bernhard performs the song in her one woman show, filmed in 1990 by John Boskovich and released as the film Without You I'm Nothing. The group Reflection Eternal which is made up of rapper Talib Kweli and producer Hi-Tek has a version titled \\"For Women\\" on their 2000 debut album Train of Thought. Berlin soul singer Joy Denalane, featuring Sara Tavares, Chiwoniso & Deborah, interpreted the song on her 2002 debut album Mamani. A cover version of this song was featured in the ending credits of the 2010 movie For Colored Girls, featuring a sample of Nina Simone singing the 1st verse (as Aunt Sarah) with newly re-recorded vocals performed by Nina's daughter, Lisa Simone, singing Safronia's verse, Laura Izibor singing the role of Sweet Thing, and Ledisi singing Peaches' verse. The song was also on the 2010 show Black Girls Rock!. It is covered by R&B; vocalists Kelly Price as Aunt Sarah, Marsha Ambrosius as Safronia, Jill Scott as Sweet Thing, and Ledisi as Peaches. The song inspired the 2016 play Nina Simone: Four Women by Christina Ham. In the play, Nina meets the first three women (she is the fourth) at the site of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, and they become the characters in her song. The song is sampled in the 2017 song \\"The Story of O.J.\\" from rapper Jay-Z's thirteenth album 4:44, mixing many of the lyrics to create a background track. The song visits similar themes of injustice and suffering of African-American people in modern America.

Administration Classes are held each Saturday throughout the academic year, from September through May at Pupin Hall at Columbia University. There are no tuition charges for the program, but students must provide their own transportation expenses, to and from Columbia's campus in New York City. The program receives funding from the university, and donations from corporations and foundations, as well individual donations from students. Admission To apply to the SHP, students must go online to the Columbia SHP website; however, this was not the procedure in 1958 when the program started. The main portion of the application process is a rigorous, three-hour examination proctored in the Columbia University campus that contains questions in both mathematics and science. The exam is tripartite, consisting of a 50 question \\"easy\\" mathematics section, a 75 question survey science section, and a 15 question \\"challenge\\" mathematics section. The average acceptance rate for the program is usually around 10%. There are 300-400 participants in the program across all 3 grades (10,11,12). Applications are mailed to schools within a 75-mile radius of Columbia's New York City campus, and there are several more requirements besides the test: A transcript of the student's grades, a recommendation by a science or math teacher, and a student essay are also required.

SM.81s also fought in the Spanish Civil War with the Aviazione Legionaria and were among the first aircraft sent by the fascist powers to aid Francisco Franco. In spite of their obsolescence, when Italy became involved in the Second World War, approximately 300 SM.81s were in service with the Regia Aeronautica. Its low speed and vulnerability to fighter aircraft meant that daytime duties were second line, with the aircraft being used primarily as a transport. At night, the SM.81 was an effective bomber, particularly in the North African theatre. Most SM.81s were withdrawn from use by the time of the Italian armistice of 1943, although some remained in service of both the Italian Social Republic and the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force. Several examples survived the war and went on to serve the Aeronautica Militare Italiana, but by 1950 they had all been retired. Early history The first 100 aircraft were delivered to 7, 9, 13 and 15 Wings, serving initially in Ethiopia where they proved to be well suited. They were quickly adapted to the roles of bombing, strafing, close air support and reconnaissance. This was an aggressive war against Italy's old adversary that in 1896 had defeated the Italian expedition corps at Adwa, and despite international conventions, both the Italians and Abyssinians committed many war crimes, including the use of chemical weapons, with SM.81s deploying Phosgene and Yperite against enemy troops. A total of 170 bombers ‚Äî Caproni Ca.133s and SM.81s ‚Äî operated in the Ethiopian war in the two groups of 9 Wing, which was a cloned unit (\\"bis\\") of the original 9¬∞ that remained in Italy. After entering Addis Ababa in 1936, the Italians continued to face fierce opposition for many months. The situation only became stable in 1937 by virtue of Italian air supremacy and support, which was decisive against an extremely dangerous enemy in this difficult and wild terrain. 36 SM.81s remained in Ethiopia to provide support to Italian troops occupying the country, including transport and the airlifting of supplies. Small arms fire was the main danger, as the missions were flown at low altitude, but the damage was normally insufficient to bring down the aircraft, even though they had no protective armour apart from having self-sealing fuel tanks. SM.81s also initially operated with 8 Wing (Bologna), 10 (Bresso), 11 (Ferrara), 12 (Guidonia), 14 and 16 (Vicenza), 30, 32 and 33 Wings (Napoli); they also equipped 15¬∞ in Libya, where they were fitted with Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K engines and anti-sand filters. Spanish Civil War The main career of the SM.81 started on 28 July 1936. On a mission dedicated to supporting General Francisco Franco and his \\"alzamiento\\" (uprising) against the Republican government at the start of the Spanish Civil War; 12 SM.81s under the guise of Spanish civilian ownership took off from Elmas, near Cagliari, to fly to Morocco carrying 63 non-uniformed troops led by Colonel Ivanoe Bonomi. The anticipated ferry flight was around 1,135 km (705 mi), but several problems occurred en route. A Savoia Marchetti SM.81 in action during the Spanish Civil War (escorted by Fiat CR.32 fighters) The journey should have been flown in less than four and a half hours at 260‚Äì270 km/h (160-170 mph), but on encountering strong headwinds at 1,000 m (3,280 ft) they climbed to 3,500 m (11,480 ft). the best cruise altitude for the Alfa Romeo 125 engines. After five hours they were still an hour from their final destination of Melilla in Morocco. Trying to maintain tight formation despite the clouds was also fuel-costly, with non- linear flight, only nine aircraft managed to land at Melilla. One ditched in the sea, another crash-landed and a third force-landed without damage in Algeria. The remaining aircraft arrived with an average of only 130 L (34 US gal) of fuel remaining in the tanks, the most being the 200 L (53 US gal) left. This aircraft was sent to search for the missing SM.81s. Being only 3% of the total fuel capacity, this was enough for just a few minutes of flight and meant that, with only a slightly stronger headwind, all of them would have been lost or forced to land in Algeria. The surviving aircraft were valuable assets and soon put to use as troop-transports and bombers. Franco's Spanish Army of Africa troops were fundamental to raising the fortunes of the alzamiento which had hitherto been mainly beaten by the Republican loyalists. On 6 August 1936, African troops were transported to Spain aboard four merchant ships. The threat of the SM.81s and their bombs, once reinforced by the Italian ship RM Morandini, were sufficient to keep the mainly Republican Spanish fleet at bay, which otherwise would have been able to prevent any Francoist convoy reaching Spain. On 9 August, SM.81s under the command of Ettore Muti, destroyed the Spanish Navy's fuel and ammunition reserves in the vicinity, forcing the fleet to use northern bases and further preventing interference with the sea-transport of Hispano-Moroccan forces. After these exploits, the initial SM.81s were reinforced by aircraft from four other squadrons: 213, 214, 215 and 216 in two Groups (XXXIV and XXXV), and by 251 and 252 squadrons for the XXV (\\"Pipistrelli\\") Group. Throughout the war, SM.81s were used as attack aircraft as well as in the transport role and as bombers. Although some missions were flown with Fiat CR.32 fighter escorts, unescorted day missions were only made possible by flying in tight formation with mutual machine gun protection, and by the aircraft's ability to fly on instruments while in cloud. Sorties were increasingly flown at night after the arrival of Polikarpov I-15 and I-16s in Spain, at which point only seven of the original nine aircraft were still serviceable, having released 210 tonnes (230 tons) of bombs and contributed (together with Junkers Ju 52s) to 868 flights transporting Morocco's troops. After thousands of hours flown by 90 to 100 aircraft, at least 64 surviving SM.81s were left behind in Spain in the G-12 Group at the end of 1938. One example was lost near the end of the war in 1939 along with the lives of many senior officers. The precise total number of SM.81 losses during the war in combat and from operational causes is not known. Further developments Even if this aircraft was used for many tasks and by many units, the modest speed of the S.81 soon led to it being replaced by the SM.79 for many applications. One of the later SM.81 models developed had two Isotta Fraschini Asso inline liquid cooled engines with 626 kW (840 hp). But its performance was quite disappointing, including 330 km/h (210 mph) maximum speed, so the modifications were not successful. Another version was a tanker aircraft (for fuel transport, not air-to-air refuelling). A command version was built with powerful radio equipment. The VIP version was used in some numbers. Mussolini had one that he piloted personally. It was called the 'Turtle', a reference to its slow speed. Another nickname of the SM.81 was \\"Lumache\\" (snail). But the wide fuselage was more comfortable than the 'fast bombers' like the Sparviero. An innovative feature was the new Caproni- Lanciani turret, armed with a 12.7 mm (.5 in) heavy machine gun. This was considered better than two 7.7 mm (0.303 in), although the Scotti machine gun proved to be unreliable. Another experimental example was an aircraft for dealing with magnetic mines: it was called the Saturno because it had a large electrified steel ring to trigger the mines. The weight of the gear was initially too high so the ring was changed to one made of aluminium. Another task for the SM.81 was as a torpedo bomber. Experiments with up to two torpedoes were carried out in 1936. But even with only one on board, the aircraft was too slow, so this task was better suited to the SM.79. The main task for this aircraft was as a transport. The SM.81T design was produced in 1941, fitted with a Caproni-Lanciani turret and AR 126 engines. More were produced in 1942, in spite of the availability of the larger SM.82. S.81s were almost as fast as the C-47, and had a defensive weapon set, while the range and payload was almost equal, with only a slight inferiority on installed power and speed. The late 1930s and World War II The SM.81 was one of the most ubiquitous multi-engine aircraft of the Regia Aereonautica in the second half of the 1930s. It was a pleasant and reliable aircraft to fly, even if it was too slow and not as manoeuvrable as the SM.79. The aircraft made a good impression in pre-war exercises, flying in three-aircraft formations. Several complex manoeuvres were performed, but the reality, in spite of the propaganda of the regime, was that the Regia lagged behind in training and tactics, in spite of a small core of very experienced aircrew. With Albania's occupation, the SM.81 was used by 37 and 39 Wings as a transport aircraft over the Adriatic Sea, quickly taking soldiers to Albania in a much publicized operation that showed the 'efficiency' of the Italian armed forces. In Libya, in 1938, a whole parachute battalion was lifted when the King went on an official visit to Italo Balbo's colony. Production of the SM 81 at this point was: SIAI, 237; Piaggio, 60; Macchi, 76; CRDA, 36; Breda, 36; CMSA, 58; AerUmbra, 20; and Caproni, eight. Total, 530 (plus one twin-engine example, the SIAI). When World War II began, the Regia still had approximately 300 machines on charge, with 37 Wing at Lecce and 40 Group of 38 Wing. The other 38 Wing group, 39¬∞, was in Albania. The Egeum Aereonautic, a small and almost independent military entity of the RA, had 39 Wing, Libya had 14 and 15 Wings and five Groups in Ethiopia were present with this aircraft in strength. SM.81s fought initially with anti-ship attacks and missions over Alexandria. 37, 38 and 39 Wings fought at Punta Stilo, others saw modest success at the battle of Capo Spada. Alexandria was attacked for the first time on 7 July, with 11 machines. These long-range missions were repeated on 16 and 25 July, 26 August, 8 and 21 September and 5 October. All these missions, especially those against ships, were only modestly successful. Greece was attacked in the fall, with the use of 37 Wings at Valona and 39 at Lecce. There were 59 SM.81s In eastern Africa, every group had around a squadron of aircraft. Despite the presence of the more modern SM.79, the SM.81 was the main Italian bomber. The first Italian aircraft to see action in East Africa were a pair of SM.81s. On 11 June 1940, one of them attacked Port Sudan, the other carried out a reconnaissance flight over the Red Sea. That same night, three SM.81s took off to bomb Aden, but one turned back, one of the other two hit a hill near Massawa while trying to land.Sutherland 2009, p. 31. When Gloster Gladiators and Hawker Hurricanes made the things difficult, the SM.81 was used less and less. Initially only 43 of the 59 aircraft were operational. They were involved in several bombing sorties, generally at night. SM.81s were used to bomb a major British convoy without suffering any losses, but many aircraft were damaged. On 13 June, four bombers were sent to Aden, the main British base, two of them were shot down. In 30 days, nine aircraft were shot down, 10 were destroyed on the ground, and 18 were badly damaged - two-thirds of the total; there were no replacements. On 10 February, there were only 10 serviceable aircraft, only three remained in March. An SM.81 with an A.130/AR.8 long-range radio landed at Kirkuk in the spring of 1941. It was the command aircraft for the expedition made by Italian forces (together with the Germans), to help the 1941 Iraqi rising. But the Iraqis were already defeated by the British, so the Axis mission failed. Of the 12 Fiat CR.42s of the \\"Squadriglia Irak\\", only seven returned. In North Africa and Italy, SM.81s were used more and more as night bombers, no longer assigned to anti-ship and day-light bombing after the first year of war. 145 Group delivered as of the end of January 1941: 11,600 men and 1,140 tonnes (1,260 tons) of various materials, in 3,200 flying hours. For Operation Herkules, the invasion of Malta, SM.81s of 18 Wing were to have moved an assault division to Malta, but in the end they were used to transport the Folgore division to El Alamein. After that battle, SM.81s were used to supply the North African forces with reinforcements and stores and to evacuate Tunisia, with 18 Wing alone transporting 28,000 men. In Pantelleria and Lampedusa, SM.81s were the only Italian air cargo aircraft capable of operating due to the short runways. SM.81s were used only for second-line tasks like troop and materials transport after the first year of the war. Many were marked with the red cross and evacuated wounded. Almost all the first-line Groups had SM.81s or other aircraft in their squadrons for use as support aircraft and transport, with one SM.81 often present in every squadron. SM.81s with their fixed and robust undercarriage were able to operate from every type of terrain, despite the lack of slats, unlike the SM.79s. Many SM.81s and SM.73s were in Russia during the Battle of Stalingrad. These aircraft tried to help the trapped troops when the Soviets began the Stalingrad offensive, all these machines were lost in that battle. In September 1943, there were still numerous SM.81s in Italy. Many of them were organized in the south into bomber and transport groups, some flew sorties in the Balkan territories. Eventually the lack of spare parts stopped SM.81 operations. There were some 60 aircraft in northern Italy, 36 of which were still serviceable. The Transport Group Terracciano, commanded by Maggiore Egidio Pellizzari, was formed in Bergamo and transferred to Goslar, in Lower Saxony, Germany, in January 1944. Here 44 SM.81s were waiting for Italian pilots.Neulen 2000, p. 85. The aircraft, in bad condition, were restored to an operational state by their future crews. Administratively the Italians were subordinated to the ANR but operationally to the Luftwaffe under the German designation of \\"Transport Gruppe Italien 10\\".Neulen 2000, pp. 85-86. On 8 April, the first squadron equipped with 12 SM.81s, was deployed to ≈†iauliai in Lithuania, followed by the Savoia-Marchetti from the 2nd and 3rd squadrons. The Terracciano operated over the Baltic States, Russia and Finland, evacuating wounded soldiers and carrying fresh troops to the front.Neulen 2000, p. 86. On 16 June 19 SM.81s landed in Immola, Finland, bringing from Estonia the technical personnel of the German combat task force Gefechtsverband Kuhlmey sent to strengthen the fighter force in Finland.Neulen 2000, p. 215. When the Soviets broke through to Jelgava, in Latvia, in July 1944, the \\"Transport Gruppe Italien 10\\" still had 32 serviceable Pipistrelli but there was a shortage of fuel and the Germans were less interested in Italian transport.Neulen 2000, p. 86. Thus, after six months of heavy employment the surviving aircraft, some of which were badly damaged, were phased out. None of this group of SM.81s survived the war, as the last four were destroyed when hostilities ended. References ;Notes ;Bibliography *Mondey, David.

He played as an inside forward, and signed for Sheffield Wednesday in 1934 at the age of 16. He went on to play for Sunderland and Lincoln City, also taking up managerial duties in his brief time at Lincoln. He was also capped for England on four occasions, scoring three goals in doing so. Robinson's career lasted from 1935 to 1949, making 200 league appearances and scoring 71 goals. Robinson lost some of his best years to the Second World War during which time he continued to play for Sheffield Wednesday in the regional wartime leagues making 109 appearances and scoring 91 goals, although these matches are not recognised in official records. Early years John Allan Robinson was born in the village of Shiremoor on 10 August 1917, with one brother and two sisters. He excelled in sport at school, where he was a champion athlete and played on the school's rugby and football teams. He earned a county schoolboy cap in 1930, at the age of 13. As a youth he played for West Wylam, a junior team affiliated to a coal mine in the small town of Prudhoe to the west of Newcastle upon Tyne. Despite being one of the youngest members of the team he began to make a name for himself as a fast, tricky inside forward. In 1934, Sheffield Wednesday manager Billy Walker came to watch a wing half who was marking Robinson in a match against West Wylam. However, Robinson outplayed the wing half and Walker approached Robinson's parents for permission to sign the 16-year-old. Club career Sheffield Wednesday Robinson joined a very successful Sheffield Wednesday team, which in the 1934‚Äì35 season finished third in Division one and won the FA Cup. For the majority of the season Robinson had played for the youth team, having not even turned out for the reserves when he made a surprise his first team debut on 22 April 1935 against West Bromwich Albion. This was just five days before the FA Cup final against the same team and Robinson replaced club captain Ronnie Starling who was being rested for the final. Robinson had not even brought his boots for the match and borrowed Starling's. He scored the goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw. Five days later Robinson was a non-playing member of the Wednesday squad which beat West Bromwich 4‚Äì2 in the FA Cup final. Conscious of his young age, Billy Walker only used Robinson occasionally in the 1935‚Äì36 season, and he made just five appearances. He became a regular in the team the following season and his good form led to a call up for an England international trial at Burnley on 17 March 1937. Two months later he was selected for the full England side to play Finland in Helsinki on 20 May 1937 at the age of 19 years 283 days. Sheffield Wednesday were relegated in 1937 and started the 1937‚Äì38 season in Division Two, several of the bigger clubs tried to sign Robinson but he stayed with Wednesday along with fellow international Ted Catlin. Robinson's form remained good throughout that season and he was selected for the England's sides three match tour of continental Europe in May 1938. The onset of World War II interrupted Jackie Robinson's rising career. During the war years he was stationed at Middlesbrough and continued to play for Sheffield Wednesday in the Football League North. His goal scoring record was excellent, scoring 91 goals in 109 games although the standard of play was obviously reduced. After the war Robinson was made club captain for Wednesday for the 1946‚Äì47 season but after just seven matches that season he was sold to Sunderland for ¬£5,000, aged 29. His last game for Wednesday was a 0‚Äì1 defeat on 25 September 1946 against Chesterfield at Hillsborough . The reason cited for the transfer was that Robinson was training at Newcastle United on weekdays and just travelling to Sheffield for matches and the board found this unacceptable for the club captain. He played 121 official games for Sheffield Wednesday (including FA Cup), scoring 39 goals. If the regional wartime matches are included, he played 228 games, scoring 130 times. Sunderland Jackie Robinson played for three seasons at Sunderland, forming a fine attacking partnership with Len Shackleton. In total he played 82 league games and scored 32 goals, all in the First Division. By the summer of 1949, Robinson was 32 years old and Sunderland had just signed a classy inside forward in Ivor Broadis from Carlisle United. First team opportunities seemed to be limited so he accepted the post of Player-coach at Lincoln City for the 1949‚Äì50 season. Lincoln City Robinson only played in nine games (eight league and one FA cup) for Lincoln, scoring five goals. His ninth game was on Christmas Eve 1949, a home league match in the old Division Three North against Wrexham. Robinson scored two goals in the game but received a broken leg when scoring the second goal. The x-ray in Lincoln hospital revealed a complicated break and he never played competitive football again.Lincoln City F.C. Archive. Gives details of Lincoln city career. International career Robinson was selected for the England's sides three match tour of continental Europe in May 1938. The first match was against Germany in Berlin on 14 May, the match was infamous because the England players were forced to give the Nazi salute. None of the England players wanted to do the salute but the British ambassador insisted to keep the crowd in a good frame of mind. The game itself resulted in a fine 6‚Äì3 victory for England with Jackie Robinson scoring twice. The England tour continued with matches against Switzerland (lost 1‚Äì2) and France (won 4‚Äì2), although Robinson was rested for the France match. Personal life After football Jackie Robinson became a landlord of a public house, running \\"The Ship\\" in Gateshead very successfully for a few years in the 1950s. After that he moved back to his home town of Shiremoor. Jackie died on 30 July 1972, aged 54 from cancer, having previously had two strokes and kidney problems.

III, c.74) was a British Act of Parliament passed in 1779 which introduced a policy of state prisons for the first time. The Act was drafted by the prison reformer John Howard and the jurist William Blackstone and recommended imprisonment as an alternative sentence to death or transportation. The prison population in England and Wales had swollen following the initial fighting in the American Rebellion and the government's attendant decision, by the Criminal Law Act 1776 (16 Geo. 3 c.43), to temporarily halt use of the American Colonies as the standard destination for transported criminals. \\"An act to authorise, for a limited time, the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty's colonies and plantations.\\" As early as 1777, Howard had produced a report to a House of Commons select committee which identified appalling conditions in most of the prisons he had inspected. While the purpose of the Act had been to create a network of state-operated prisons, and despite its passage through Parliament, the act resulted only in considerable study of methods, alternatives and possible locations; no prisons would be built as a direct result of the act, although the prison network and alternatives would be created over time.

Early life Galla-Rini was born in Manchester, Connecticut, the third of seven children to John and Angela Galla-Rini, an Italian immigrant family. His father started teaching Galla-Rini the cornet at the age of four. In the same year, he made his debut on the Vaudeville circuit with the family band, and an encore performance of \\"Casey Jones\\" on the cornet. It was at this time that Galla-Rini also learned to play the accordion, a three-row button instrument. Galla-Rini performed on the Vaudeville circuit for twenty years, in that time learning to play 11 woodwind and brass instruments in addition to the accordion, as well as theory in harmony and counterpoint, and operatic and symphonic conducting. He toured the United States with his family, playing with such Vaudeville stars as Mae West, The Marx Brothers, Jack Benny, Jimmy Durante, and Eddie Cantor. After his sisters dropped out of the family's act when he was twelve, Galla-Rini's accordion playing became more important to the act as his father John played a more diverse range of instruments. It was at this time Galla-Rini realized the accordion was a complete musical instrument in itself, devoting more time and attention to the accordion and eventually abandoning all other musical instruments in favor of the accordion. Career In 1924 Galla-Rini dropped out of his father's Vaudeville act due to disputes over salary, and joined his sisters, forming a separate act that lasted until 1932. Their salary peaked at around $600 per week. The Vaudeville ended with the advent of motion pictures with sound, forcing Galla-Rini's family to find other forms of work. Galla- Rini decided to open an accordion studio in San Francisco. He established himself as a teacher, writing both accordion instruction books and also various music for the instrument. In 1933, Galla-Rini married Dina Petromilli, and their son Ronald Pascal was born three years later. Eventually Galla-Rini moved from California to New York City, to be closer to various music publishers, Galla-Rini eventually writing music for more than 30 publishing houses. Galla-Rini was one of the founding members of the American Accordionists' Association (AAA) in 1938 in New York City, and is in fact their first member. He also founded the International Accordion Teachers' Guild (ATG), in 1941 in Chicago serving as President Emeritus of that society throughout his career. In addition, Galla-Rini also served as a Vice-President of the Conf√©d√©ration Internationale des Accord√©onistes (CIA), a member of the United Nations' International Music Council (IMC). In 1941 Galla-Rini also composed his Accordion Concerto in G Minor (no. 1), and premiered it with the Oklahoma City University Symphony Orchestra on November 15, 1941. Since then there have been more than 39 performances of this concerto in the United States as well as additional performances in England, Finland, Norway and Canada.Henry Doktorski, The Classical Squeezebox: A Short History of the Accordion and Other Free-Reed Instruments in Classical Music (The Classical Free-Reed, Inc., Pittsburgh: 1997) This concerto was recorded by Swedish accordionist and Galla-Rini prot√©g√© J√∂rgen Sundeqvist with organist H√•kan Dahlen and released in 2005 on a CD by Courthourse Music of Sweden.See http://cgi.ebay.com/Classical-Accordion-w-Pipe-Organ-Galla-Rini- Concerto_W0QQitemZ110183015176QQihZ001QQcategoryZ307QQcmdZViewItem Galla-Rini returned to California in 1942, and began teaching accordion again. He joined a rumba band playing at the Trocadero on Sunset Boulevard, leading to invitations to record soundtracks for the Hollywood film industry, playing in many films, including Rhapsody in Blue, High Noon, and The Gunfighter. During the next decade, he performed on concert tours in various theaters across the United States. He also toured England, Scotland, Norway and Sweden in 1950, taking his family with him. In 1951 he represented the ATG at the CIA General Assembly and Coupe Mondiale in Paris, resulting in the CIA accepting the ATG as a member organization. In 1958 and 1959, he performed as a guest artist in Carnegie Hall. In 1968, Dina Galla-Rini died. Three years later, Anthony married Dolly Cortella. He was married to her until she died at the age of 101. In 1975, the President of Italy conferred on him the title of \\"Cavalier of the Star of Solidarity\\" in recognition of his efforts towards strengthening the cultural bonds between Italian and American people and for his interest in the development of the Italian accordion in America. Galla-Rini was also the first person to be inducted in the ATG Hall of Fame on his 99th birthday in 2003. In 1976 he composed \\"Accordion Concerto No. 2 in E minor\\" (in three movements) for the free-bass system. And in 1983 he composed \\"Sonata in D minor\\" for accordion (also in three movements).Ove Hahn, Anthony Galla-Rini: On His Life and the Accordion (Nils Fl√§cke Musik, Stockholm: 1986) Death and legacy Galla-Rini died of a heart attack in a hospital in Corona, CA at the age of 102 after a nurse reported problems at the nursing home where he lived. Galla-Rini's career spanned 98 years as a professional accordionist, and more than 74 years as an accordion teacher. He has arranged literally hundreds of transcriptions for accordion ensembles, orchestras and soloists. He has also played a major part in pioneering the development of the modern accordion, developing the treble and bass registers, as well as standardizing the stradella bass system on the accordion.Anthony Galla-Rini, A Collection of Lectures for Accordionists (Music Graphics Press, San Diego: 1981) References Bibliography A Collection of Lectures for Accordionists (Music Graphics Press, San Diego: 1981) External links  Galla-Rini discography by Petosa Accordions * Galla-Rini biography by Petosa Accordions * Galla-Rini memorial at Accordions Worldwide * Galla-Rini memorial by student Joan Sommers * Galla-Rini with harpist Charlotte Laughton Tinsley Category:American accordionists Category:American classical accordionists Category:Vaudeville performers Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American centenarians Category:1904 births Category:2006 deaths Category:20th-century American musicians Category:20th-century classical musicians Category:20th-century accordionists ","title":"Anthony Galla-Rini"},{"id":"13080245","text":"Kurt Poletti (born 23 April 1960) is a Swiss bobsledder who competed in the early 1980s.

The bridge is long and cost $124.7 million to build. The bridge also crosses Wappoo Creek, which is a part of the Intracoastal Waterway. History The original SC 30 traveled from St. George to Beaufort. In 1926, SC 39 was extended north with SC 4 from Santee to Summerton on a new route to Sumter, replaced SC 42 north to Bishopville, east with SC 34 to Lydia, then replaced SC 351 north to Hartsville, then northeast on a new route through Society Hill to Bennettsville, then replaced SC 38 northeast to the North Carolina state line at McColl. In 1927, it was truncated to Walterboro, as parts were transferred to US 17 and SC 28 (this segment is now part of US 21). The remainder became part of US 401 in 1933. SC 30 was reused in 1935 as a renumbering of SC 15 from US 221 in Watts Mills to SC 92 near Cross Anchor. In 1956, this became part of an extended SC 49\\\\. The current route was proposed as early as the 1960s to provide a second and more direct connection between James Island and downtown Charleston. It opened on September 4, 1993 and provided a route off the island that did not require crossing a drawbridge.

The shells were transported by truck, rail and ship ultimately ending up at Johnston Atoll for incineration at the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System facility. Site 59 was sold and the bunkers were used to grow mushrooms. The area also had solar panels added for power generation. There is a 2.5 ton truck buried under the circular area used as a heliport - the truck was stolen from Pirmasens' base and used for spare parts during an inspection in 1976. A M151 Jeep in also buried next to the nearby bunker. When the US military began to downsize in the 1990s, the small US Army posts associated with Husterhoeh Kaserne (Pirmasens) were returned to Germany, including ones located at Ma√üweiler, Munchweiler, Fischbach, and Clausen. Clausen's primary industry is agricultural though it is a short drive to Pirmasens. It is located nearby the recreation area Clausensee and the area has many opportunities for outdoor recreation. The fields east of Clausen contain many concrete tank barriers remaining from WWII.

It is bordered by Interstate 280 to the west, State Route 92 to the south, Polhemus Road to the east, and Crystal Springs Road, which parallels San Mateo Creek, to the north. The town of Hillsborough is just north of the Highlands and the city of Belmont is to the south. Geography View from the Highlands Sunset over the Highlands The Highlands is known for its scenic views. The stunning geographical features and proximity to two major highways (Interstate 280 and State Route 92) make the Highlands both very attractive and convenient. The Highlands sits on top of Pulgas Ridge, west of the city of San Mateo overlooking the Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir which lies just to the west and straddles the San Andreas fault. The Cahill Ridge of Montara Mountain lies just to the west of Crystal Springs and gives a dramatic view to the west side of the Highlands. The east side of the Highlands offers beautiful unobstructed views of San Francisco Bay, the San Mateo Bridge, and on clear days, Mount Diablo in Contra Costa County. On three sides, the Highlands is surrounded by open space, with canyons to the north and east and a more gentle sloping hillside to the west. Climate Due to its location on the top of a ridge, near the gap in the Santa Cruz Mountains where SR 92 transects the mountains, the Highlands receives a good deal of foggy weather as hot dry air in the Central Valley pulls cool, moist air off the Pacific Ocean. Temperatures in the Highlands are typically five to ten degrees (F) colder than cities just to the south of the SR 92 gap. Recreation The Highlands Recreation District was formed in 1957 with an elected Board of Directors. In 1958 they began construction on building the facilities, and now offer a year-round swimming pool, tennis courts, playground, community social room, and gym. The Recreation District offers children's programs from infant and toddler day care to teen cooking classes as well as adult educational and community programs. The Highlands is also very close to Sawyer Camp Trail and many residents are able to jog or bike to the trail from their homes. The trail runs for 6 miles (10 km) along the Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir and offers scenic views, wildlife and safe paved trails for jogging, biking, walking, roller blading, and bicycling. Ca√±ada Road, which runs parallel to I-280, is also easily reached by joggers and bicyclists from the Highlands. Ca√±ada Road is closed to traffic on Sundays from March to October to allow safe jogging, walking, bicycling or roller blading with scenic views of Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir. The area is adjacent to Pulgas Ridge Open Space Preserve, which also includes hiking trails. History and architecture Eichler Home in the San Mateo Highlands The Highlands was developed as a working-class neighborhood in the mid 1950s. Developer Joseph Eichler, between 1956 and 1964, built most of the homes using a Modernist style now called \\"California Modern\\", inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright. The homes are post and beam construction featuring much glass, skylights, and atria. Most have a flat or gently sloped roof and in-floor radiant heating. Many of the neighborhood homes retain their original exterior form and are sought after by enthusiasts of Modern architecture. The neighborhood also includes the experimental X-100, one of only two Eichler houses built using steel rather than timber, as well as Eichlers with additions or other modifications from their original form and homes built by other developers in more traditional styles. Adjacent to the Highlands neighborhood is a large, undeveloped parcel of land that is zoned as a Resource Management district by San Mateo County. Highlands residents have been fighting development of this parcel for over two decades. Many residents of the Highlands feel that the open space surrounding the Highlands is one of the many charms that makes the neighborhood unique and highly valued and do not wish to see further development there. Additionally many are concerned about the safety of building on the steep hillsides that comprise the parcel. Recent recommendations by the San Mateo County Planning Commission related to development on this parcel may have much wider implications for similarly zoned parcels across the county. In prior years there has also been vigorous debate in the Highlands about changing the zoning laws to restrict development or alteration of original Eichler homes to a single story. Authority over zoning in the Highlands is held by the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors. Current zoning allows for homes up to 36 ft. high (up to three stories). The original single-story Eichlers are 9 to 11 ft. high while two-story homes in the neighborhood by other developers reach up to 23 feet in height. The neighborhood includes over 700 single-story Eichler homes, a handful of original two-story Eichler homes built up against steep hillsides, and 55 later 2nd story additions (remodels). Community The Highlands Community Association is a volunteer-run community association. It is not a homeowners association and, as such, does not have authority to set laws or policies in the neighborhood. Membership in the Highlands Community Association requires a nominal fee. The Association publishes a monthly newsletter, the Highlands Lowdown, which has been in continuous publication since 1954. The Association also sponsors an annual 4th of July festival, begun and continuously run since 1960. The 4th of July festival includes a parade and fireworks display on the evening of July 3. The fireworks display is intended for the Highlands community only, not outside guests. Following the parade on the morning of July 4 are other activities including a water carnival with swim races, arcade games, food, a foot race and other activities. The United Methodist Church in the Highlands offers community discussions, day care services and has an active theater group known as the Crystal Springs Players.

Matthews Robert James Matthews (12 September 1926 ‚Äì 30 August 2009) was a Latter-day Saint religious educator and scholar, teaching in the departments of Ancient Scripture and Religious Education at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. Beginning with personal contacts early in his career, Matthews was instrumental in conciliating relations between religious scholars affiliated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and the Community of Christ, which had separated in a schism in the 1840s. The two religious communities and their scholars had long been at odds over access to and interpretation of important early texts of the Latter Day Saint movement. Matthews was particularly influential when in 1969 and 1970, scholars affiliated with the Community of Christ were invited to meetings of the Mormon History Association. The new scholars were welcomed, and some were chosen as officers in the organization in later years. Matthews is also noted for his promotion of the concept that the currently-available text of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible is reliable and authentic. Biography Matthews was born in Evanston, Wyoming., the youngest child of immigrant parents, who independently joined the LDS Church in England and moved to the United States. He earned a bachelor's degree in Political Science, a master's degree in Geography, and a PhD in Ancient Scriptures, all from BYU. His doctoral dissertation was A Plainer Translation: Joseph Smith's Translation of the Bible ‚Äì A History and Commentary.SL Tribune Matthews and his wife, Shirley Neves, are the parents of four children: Camille, Daniel, Robert, and Tricia.SL Tribune Matthews died in Provo, Utah, after an extended hospitalization for complications following open heart surgery. Teaching and scholarship Matthews began teaching in the Church Educational System (CES), as a seminary teacher in Soda Springs, Idaho, in 1955. He also taught institute classes in Southern California, under the direction of Paul H. Dunn, and was a course writer and editor with the seminaries and institutes division of CES. In 1968, Matthews received a PhD in Ancient Scriptures from BYU. He began teaching in the Division of Religious Education at BYU in 1971. He served as dean of Religion Education at BYU for eight and a half years and then was a professor and department chair of the Ancient Scripture Department until his retirement, in 1992. Matthews has the distinction of being the first person from the LDS Church to be allowed by the Community of Christ to work with the original manuscript of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, which was in its possession. He was a principal collaborator involved in compiling the Encyclopedia of Mormonism and authored articles on the Book of Moses and the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible. LDS Church service From 1946 to 1948, Matthews was a Mormon missionary in California, a portion of the church's Western States Mission. His mission president was Oscar W. McConkie, father of Bruce R. McConkie. In the 1970s, Matthews served on the Church Adult Correlation Committee. Earlier, he had served as a bishop, high councilor and stake president. In the mid-1990s, Matthews was the first president of the Mount Timpanogos Utah Temple. At the time of his death, he was serving as a stake patriarch. Matthews was the chief editor of the LDS Church's 1979 Bible Dictionary, which is printed together with the church's English edition of the King James Bible.Lavina Fielding Anderson, \\"Church Publishes First LDS Edition of the Bible\\", Ensign, October 1979, p. 9.

He died in Paris. \\"French composer, harpsichordist, theorist and teacher. He probably learnt music in the ma√Ætrise of the collegiate church of Notre Dame, Mantes, and in that of Evreux Cathedral. According to the Etat actuel de la Musique du Roi (1773) he then studied with Caldara in Rome. In 1692 Bernier was living in the rue Tiquetonne in Paris and was teaching the harpsichord. On 20 November 1693 he failed to win the post of ma√Ætre de musique at Rouen Cathedral in competition with Jean-Fran√ßois Lalouette. He was appointed head of the ma√Ætrise of Chartres Cathedral on 17 September 1694 and remained there until 18 March 1698, when he obtained a similar position at St Germain-l'Auxerrois, Paris. A Te Deum performed before the king at Fontainebleau on 24 October 1700 was very successful, and was sung again in several Parisian churches in 1701 and 1704. On 5 April 1704 he succeeded Marc- Antoine Charpentier as ma√Ætre de musique of the Sainte-Chapelle, resigning from this post on 18 September 1726 in favour of his friend Fran√ßois de La Croix. It had taken the patronage of Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans, for him to keep the position after his marriage to Marie-Catherine Marais on 20 June 1712, since the rule of the Sainte-Chapelle required its ma√Ætre de musique to be ‚Äòa celibate in clerical garb‚Äô. In spite of Le Cerf de La Vi√©ville's claim, Bernier was not an abb√©, but only an acolyte entitled to wear the clerical collar. In 1715 he took part in the divertissements organized by the Duchess of Maine at her ch√¢teau of Sceaux. In January 1723, at the request of the regent, Michel-Richard de Lalande gave up three of his four trimestrial periods of duty as sous-ma√Ætre de musique at the Chapelle Royale. The posts thus created were allotted, without being thrown open to competition, to Andr√© Campra, Charles-Hubert Gervais and Bernier, who officiated during the summer term of duty until his death. In 1726 Lalande's term became vacant when he died, and was shared between the remaining sous-ma√Ætres, with Bernier taking charge of the education of the Chapelle pages until 1733. He was in fact famous as a teacher. He wrote a treatise entitled Principes de composition and numbered Louis-Claude Daquin among his pupils. Bernier offered a personal solution to the union of French and Italian tastes. He achieved equilibrium between the two styles in his first book of French cantatas, a genre of which he was one of the first creators together with Jean-Baptiste Morin. Vigorous recitatives and da capo airs, with or without an initial motto, follow each other freely, while the expressive melody, with few wide intervals or long melismas, is rooted more in the French tradition. Les nuits de Sceaux contains Bernier's only instrumental pieces: dances and two overtures which adopt the Lullian structure but are italianate in style. The 45 petits motets, the 36 grands motets and the 39 cantatas exhibit a stylistic feature peculiar to Bernier: the often systematic repetition of a motif, whether or not it is transposed. Bernier had a reputation as a contrapuntist, and the polished writing of fugal choruses in Beatus vir and Confitebor tibi Domine bear witness to his skill. Two of his grands motets were sung several times at the Concert Spirituel from 1725 onwards. Most of his Principes de composition is devoted to two-part counterpoint; the work resembles the treatises of Nivers and Masson.\\"grove music  Works  all printed works published in Paris  Sacred Vocal  [26] Motets, 1‚Äì3vv, bc, some with insts, op.1 (1703) 16 for 1v, 7 for 2vv, 3 for 3vv [15] Motets, 1‚Äì3vv, bc, some with insts, op.2 (1713) 11 for 1v, 3 for 2vv, 1 for 3vv 3 motets, 1v, and 1 motet, 3vv, in Motets ... par Mr. de la Croix, 1‚Äì3vv, bc, some with insts, op.1 (1741) Grands motets, all SATBB, str: Beatus vir, F-Pc; Benedic anima mea, Pc; Cantate Domino, LYm; Confitebor tibi Domine, Pc; Cum invocarem, LYm; Deus noster refugium, Pc; Lauda anima mea Dominum, Pc; Lauda Jerusalem, Pc; Laudate Dominum quoniam, Pc; Miserere mei, Pc; Venite exultemus, Pc [9] Le√ßons de T√©n√®bres, S, bc, LYm, V Mass; Te Deum: both lost Chants des offices de diff√©rents Saints nouveaus, cited in Privil√®ge G√©n√©ral, 3 March 1724, lost Motets attrib.

History In the 1970s 107 items of SM30 class locomotives were modified to heat old passenger wagons, which were modernized with 500V electric heaters, and as a result their designation was changed to SP30 (meaning a diesel locomotive able to pull passenger trains). Bogdan Pokropi≈Ñski, Lokomotywy spalinowe produkcji polskiej, WKi≈Å, Warsaw, 2009, , p. 69-72 A prototype locomotive, SM30-232 was converted in 1970. Then, in 1974-1977, 106 locomotives were converted this way by the ZNTK Nowy SƒÖcz (of those, 75 in 1974). They retained their original SM30 class numbers. Those machines remained in regular service until the late 1980s. Because of a withdrawal of old wagons, in 2000 all of them were again, after dismounting heating systems, returned to SM30 series. A similar modification was applied to SM42 class, resulting in the SU42 class. Technical data SP30 is a Bo‚Ä≤Bo‚Ä≤ locomotive, what means it runs on two bogies, each equipped with two axles. The general construction of this engine is relatively simple. The locomotive frame is constructed of steel rolled formers. Ball stub-axles are mounted to strend girders, that make welded box construction. Power unit, composed of a diesel engine and main alternator, is mounted on parallel girders. The engine is connected to main alternator with an elastic clutch. Four traction motors (two on each bogie) are mounted with a tram system. Traction motors can be powered in series connection, parallel connection and parallel connection with field reduction of 40 to 60%. Traction motors are series devices with 60 kW hour power. Main alternator (PABOM-186a type) is a DC machine with 600 V and 367 A. Its power rating whilst working with 1500 rpm. is 220 kW. During engine starting the main alternator serves as electric starter, powered from the battery. For the purposes of enlighting the locomotive and charging batteries an additional alternator (Pw-114a type) is used. The only difference between SM30 and SP30 classes is a device to provide wagons with power from the main alternator. This device allowed the locomotive to heat up to three two-axled carriages.

History Pilotage of vessels in the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary was overseen by Bristol until 1861, when Cardiff, Newport and Gloucester took concerted action because of the increase in the trades using the ports of Cardiff, Newport and Gloucester and petitioned Parliament to press for the passing of the Bristol Channel Pilotage Act 1861. This gave the ports the independence they sought. Pilotage Commissioners were constituted for these ports with powers to licence pilots for the non-compulsory pilotage of ships in the Bristol Channel and River Severn bound for these ports, each port having a defined area of jurisdiction. After a new dock was built in Sharpness in 1874 that was capable of handling larger vessels, the number of ships visiting the Gloucester docks declined and the custom house was moved to Sharpness. The Sharpness Lighthouse Authority were set up in 1888 to provide aids to navigation throughout the harbour area so that ships could enter the port both by day and night. The following year this became the Gloucester Harbour Authority which, as well as being responsible for lights in the estuary, were tasked with controlling navigation there. Gloucester Harbour Authority later evolved into the Gloucester Harbour Trustees, which later relocated to Sharpness; it is responsible for all pilotage in the estuary. The trustees also established moorings at Northwick Oaze south of Aust and created a deeper channel so that larger vessels could reach Sharpness more easily. Responsibilities The Trustees have responsibilities for navigational safety in that part of the estuary, and maintain a number of navigation aids (beacons, buoys and lighthouses), and a special 'Pilotwatch Radar' with portable sets for use by pilots. They also arrange the provision of pilots which are compulsory for most commercial shipping and other vessels over 30m l.o.a. in the GHT area. The main commercial traffic within the GHT area is to the port of Sharpness, and some sand dredging. The harbour, which has one of the world's highest tidal ranges, includes both the present road crossings and two riverside nuclear sites (one at Oldbury decommissioning, one at Berkeley decommissioning).GHT: Limits of the Gloucester Harbour The Trustees were originally constituted in 1890 and initially comprised some 22 Trustees. Today the board consists of 10 members, who are appointed in line with the principles of the ‚ÄòGuide to Good Governance‚Äô drawn up as part of the DETR‚Äôs Review of Trust Ports and in accordance with the provisions of the Gloucester Harbour Revision (Constitution) Order 2002 (which also sets out the boundaries of the Gloucester Harbour). The Gloucester Harbour Trustees, as competent harbour authority for this part of the river, have issued safety guidance for surfers, canoeists, small craft and river bank users in relation to the Severn bore, a phenomenon of the Severn Estuary and lower parts of the river under certain tidal conditions. The Gloucester Harbour Trustees area The Gloucester Harbour Trustees area, especially above Sharpness, includes many areas of interest to environmentalists. These include extensive mud flats and grassland areas on which migrating and resident birds feed and include a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The estuary experiences one of the biggest tidal ranges in the world and a Severn Barrage is often under discussion to harness the energy generated by the tide.

General description The quad vehicle design is a pressure fed in blow-down mode from an initial pressure of 320 psi for level 1 (400 psi level 2). The cold gas vernier engines are cross- fed by gas drawn from ullage space of the opposite tank. The vehicle was able to transfer propellant through connecting pipes between opposite tanks by controlling ullage pressures with the thrusters; this helps it balance, minimizing gas use. The main engine had two-axis thrust vectoring. The vehicle was fully computer controlled; with guidance from GPS and fiber optic gyros. Specification The specification for Pixel/Texel for level 1: * Width: ~1.9 m (~75 inches) * Height: ~1.9 m (~75 inches) * Dry Weight: 650 pounds * Gross Lift Off Weight (GLOW): ~1500 pounds (360 pounds ethanol, ~500 LOX) * Payload: 55 pounds * Engines: 1 (+ 4 cold gas attitude jets) * Thrust (sl): ~3000 pounds Engine (XPC-06): * Thrust: ~3000 pounds (throttleable to 25%) * Chamber Pressure: 300 psi * Nozzle Area Ratio: 2:1 * Isp (sl): ~140-~200 seconds (low- high throttle) * Length: 0.51 m (20 inches) * Diameter: 0.2 m (8 inches) * Chamber: carbon fiber reinforced graphite built by Cesaroni aerospace * Burn Time: >100 seconds, expected >180 for level 2, with approximately double the propellant mass.

Wrestling career Snyder's wrestling debut occurred during football's 1953 off-season. He was trained by Sandor Szabo and Warren Bockwinkel in Southern California.National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 237, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, In 1954, Snyder retired from football completely to pursue a full-time career in wrestling. Part of his in-ring persona included the use of many football tactics, and it garnered Snyder a lot of national attention. He had already been a regional champion in Montreal, Quebec, Canada when he made a name for himself by defeating Verne Gagne and winning the United States Championship at Marigold Arena in Chicago on April 7, 1956. Snyder was a regional champion in a myriad of territories that were affiliated with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA).National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 238, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, One of those championships was an offshoot of the world title that he won from Verne Gagne on November 15, 1958 in Omaha, Nebraska. After the departure of Jim Barnett, Snyder bought into the Indianapolis territory with Dick the Bruiser. The enterprise was known as Championship Wrestling Inc. on April 27, 1965. Snyder's wife Shirlee was listed as the registered agent. Snyder and Dick's mother, M.A. (Margaret) Johnston were listed as directors of the company, to keep the wrestler's ownership of the territory private. The defeat of Mitsu Arakawa in September 1967 added the WWA title to Snyder's list of accomplishments. The victory resulted in a two-year run as WWA Champion for Snyder. Between 1956 and 1962, he was a ten time United States Champion. Snyder was also involved in long in- ring feuds with Dick the Bruiser and Hans Schmidt. Another accomplishment of Snyder's was his reign as 13-time WWA Tag Team Champion. During a tour of Japan in 1969, Snyder teamed with Danny Hodge to claim the Japan Pro-Wrestling Alliance's NWA International Tag Team Championship. Snyder was often billed as \\"The World's Most Scientific Wrestler\\". On Bret Hart's greatest hits video Wilbur Snyder also gets a mention by Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan and \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage. Heenan claiming Snyder basically invented the abdominal stretch. Snyder's legacy was cemented by WWE announcer Jim Ross who would refer to \\"shades of the late Wilbur Snyder\\" anytime somebody used the abdominal stretch for most of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Personal life Wilbur married Shirlee Ann Hanson in 1948. He died on December 25, 1991 in Pompano Beach, Florida.

Protestant church Massweiler possessed a large cavern that had been used by Nazis in World War II. There were supposedly five levels in the cave, the lowest of which had trouble with occasional flooding. A large staircase for pedestrian traffic was near the highest point of the cavern, which led to an exit. Beside the stairs were rails that assisted in transport of earth from the cavern as it was being enlarged for German forces. The angle of this stair and matching rail system was estimated to be 30 degrees, and the height of the chamber approximately 175 feet. After the end of World War II, the cavern was occupied by the U.S. Army, in the late 1980s by a communications company. Entering the property, it appeared quite small and remote, but upon entering the cavern, the length and size of the facility was impressive.

The primary industry of the village was that of a shoe manufacturer. It lies on Strasse B-10 between Karlsruhe and Pirmasens. St. Georg The first mention of M√ºnchweiler an der Rodalben was in 1179. The village was founded by monks and relied on its religion as its focal point. Because of its poor soil quality, the area has never been able to rely on agriculture. There is some industry from logging and crafts, After the construction of the railway line between Zweibr√ºcken and Landau in the late 1800s, the area's financial hardship lessened. The area though has little industry other than the one shoe factory to rely on. There is a nearby train tunnel that was rumored to have been used to hide artillery during the war and in the forest can be seen the remnants of an old Roman era road. With the withdrawal of the military from M√ºnchweiler, it has had a profound effect on the town with the closure of many businesses and a decrease in real estate values. US Army M√ºnchweiler once had a U.S. Army base that housed soldiers and families for the 636th Ordnance Company (EOD), the 110th MP Company, HHC 84th Ordnance Battalion and others, associated with Husterhoeh Kaserne. The main building on the base was a mirror image of the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, with a functioning hospital. The 84th Ordnance Battalion and 636th Ordnance Company was housed on the base along with some German troops and other NATO troops. The 636th Ordnance Company guarded and maintained the then classified stocks of GB and VX nerve gas located at Site 59 in Clausen. The nerve agents at Site 59, were removed under Operation Steel Box in 1990. These agents were transported by truck, rail and ship ultimately ending up at Johnston Atoll for incineration at the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System facility. When the US military began to downsize in the 1990s, the small US Army posts associated with Husterhoeh Kaserne (Pirmasens) were returned to Germany, including the ones located at Ma√üweiler, Munchweiler, Fischbach, and Clausen. When the U.S. Army base at M√ºnchweiler was closed, all buildings except for the base chapel were removed. The property was then sold to real estate developers, who have repurposed the former base land for a housing development, and have started building luxury residential housing.

The civil parish includes Cote, Hackness and Bason Bridge. The parish of East Huntspill has a population of 1,146. History Until 1949 East Huntspill was part of the ancient parish and civil parish of Huntspill. The first mention of Huntspill is around 796 AD, when the area was granted to Glastonbury Abbey by Aethelmund, a nobleman under King Offa of Mercia. Huntspill was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Honspil, meaning 'Huna's creek' possibly from the Old English personal name Huna and from the Celtic pwll as used in Welsh, e.g. Pwllheli. An alternative origin is from Hun's Pill in Old English, meaning a port on a tidal inlet, or pill, belonging to a Saxon lord, or hun. The parish of Huntspill was part of the Huntspill and Puriton Hundred, Three 18th century farmhouses in East Huntspill, Hackney, New Road and Phippins, have all been designated as Grade II listed buildings. From 1856 to 1966 the village was served by Bason Bridge railway station on the Highbridge branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. In 1949 the civil parish of Huntspill was abolished and divided into Huntspill All Saints and West Huntspill along the line of the Bristol and Exeter Railway.Vision of Britain website The parish of Huntspill All Saints was renamed East Hunstspill in 1972. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Religious sites All Saints Church The Anglican parish Church of All Saints in East Huntspill was built in 1839 by G P Manners, as a chapel-of-ease to the then parish church at Huntspill. It became the parish church in 1845, when the chapelry was formed into a parochial district, and the bell-chamber was added in the late 19th century. It has been designated as a Grade II listed building. It is on the Heritage at Risk Register because of the condition of the roof. There was a United Methodist chapel in East Huntspill built in 1923, which replaced an earlier building in Chapel Lane. The chapel closed by 1997.

A national paper heard the story and sent a reporter. Unfortunately the beer had worked and the pig had been slaughtered. The resourceful farmer merely found another pig and this appeared in the newspaper article.

It has around 2,000 pupils and specialises in business and enterprise. Description City of Leicester College is in the east of Leicester on Downing Drive, off Spencefield Lane (B667). The college provides education for ages between 11-19 for different levels from GCSEs to BTECs as well as a sixth-form college. It offers a wide variety of courses but specialises in Business. It is not to be confused with the former City of Leicester College of Education in Scraptoft, which was taken over by De Montfort University and then bulldozed in 2006. As of 2020 the head teacher is Mr Ken Vernon. History The school was founded in 1920 as the City Boys' School, on East Bond Street. In 1928 it moved to Humberstone Gate, to the former buildings of the Wyggeston Hospital Girls' School, which moved to a site in Regent Road which is now the Regent College sixth form. After 1944 the City Boys' School became City of Leicester Boys' Grammar School. In 1966 it moved to the Wyvern building on Downing Drive. The Humberstone Gate building, built in 1878, was used for a few years by Charles Keene College (subsequently merged with Southfields College to form Leicester College) and is now the Leicester headquarters of Age Concern. It became known as the City of Leicester School when it became a mixed comprehensive in 1976. It merged with the Spencefield School in 1985. The Spencefield building on Downing Drive became the lower school which is now the Gill building, named after former Headmaster Mr. Gill. It gained specialist status as a Business and Enterprise College in September 2003, and the Business and Enterprise Centre (BEC) was created at the Wyvern Building.

Overview The sheerness of a fabric is expressed as a numerical denier which ranges from 3 (extremely rare, very thin, barely visible) to 15 (standard sheer for stockings) up to 30 (semi opaque) until 100 (opaque). The materials which can be made translucent include gossamer, silk, rayon or nylon. Sheer fabric comes in a wide variety of colors, but for curtains, white and shades of white, such as cream, winter white, eggshell, and ivory are popular. In some cases, sheer fabric is embellished with embroidered patterns or designs. Sheer curtains Sheer pantyhose made from nylon A common use for sheer fabric is in curtains, which allows for sunlight to pass through during daylight, while maintaining a level of privacy. Due to the loose weave in sheer fabrics curtains offer little heat insulation. However, when it is lighter on the inside of a room than it is on the outside (such as at nighttime), then the inside of the room can be seen from the outside. Sheer fabric is used in clothing, in garments such as stockings or tights and in dancewear and lingerie, and sometimes as part of clothing, such as in wedding gowns and formal costumes. Sheer fabric for clothing offers very little in the way of warmth for the wearer, and for this reason is commonly worn in hot weather. It offers relatively low sun protection. Though sheer stockings have been popular since the 1920s, and have been used in women's nightwear for some time, the use of sheer fabrics in other clothing has become more common in recent years. There was a predominant sheer fashion trend in fashion circles since 2008,The Age: 15/2/10 - 2010 Allan Border Medal with sheer fabrics being used in tight clothes, layers, and in delicate feminine draping.Sheer fashion trend: 2009 & 2010  See also  * Bodystocking * Georgette (fabric) * See- through clothing * Silk * Ultra sheer References Category:Fashion design Category:Textiles ","title":"Sheer fabric"},{"id":"13080853","text":"lion at the Art Institute of Chicago, pose informally designated by Kemeys as \\"on the prowl.\\" Bronze, 1893. Edward Kemeys (January 31, 1843 ‚Äì May 11, 1907) was an American sculptor and considered America's first animalier. He is best known for his sculptures of animals, particularly the two bronze lions that mark the entrance to the Art Institute of Chicago Building in Chicago Illinois. Kemeys was also a Captain in the 4th United States Colored Heavy Artillery, Company H, writer, lecturer, and adventurer in the Western United States. Life Kemeys was born on January 31, 1843 in Savannah, Georgia.. to Abby Greene of Providence, RI and William Kemeys of Scarborough, NY. The Kemeys family lived in Savannah, GA, moving back to New York after the death of his mother in 1843. Kemeys first worked in the iron business of New York City at age seventeen. Civil War When the Civil War broke out, Kemeys enlisted. He was 19. Kemeys volunteered for the 65th Volunteer Regiment of the State of New York. \\"I served in the Peninsula campaign till I fell sick of fever and was discharged. I went in again later as a second lieutenant.\\" Kemeys re-enlisted as a commissioned officer in the 4th United States Colored Heavy Artillery, Company H attaining the rank of Captain. He resigned his commission in 1866. After the Civil War File:Edward_Kemeys.jpg He studied in New York City and then Paris. In Paris, he was impressed by the style of Antoine-Louis Barye, although in no sense an imitator. He made a specialty of the wild animals of the American continent. His ‚ÄúFight between Buffalo and Wolves‚Äù attracted much attention at the Paris salon in 1878. Among his other important works are ‚ÄúPanther and Deer,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCoyote and Raven.‚Äù A colossal head of a buffalo for the facade of the station of the Pacific railroad at St. Louis, Missouri, which was cast in bronze in New York in August, 1887, was the largest work of its kind that had been done in the United States. Another bronze statue of a panther named \\"Still Hunt,\\" is permanently situated on a rock flanking the East Drive of New York City's Central Park. Kemeys died in Washington, D.C. on May 11, 1907.

It has a population of roughly 600. A former monastic yard grew into the village near the end of the Middle Ages, due to the establishment of an iron ore smelting plant by the Dukes of the Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. The popularity of Wasgauer iron ore, which was smelted in Schoenau, reached its peak in the middle of the 19th century and lasted until 1883, when the facility was shut down. The post office issued a special stamp to mark the occasion of Sch√∂nau's 850th anniversary in the year 1982. Sch√∂nau was the seat of many social organizations over the years, the first one being \\"Gesellschaft f√ºr Versch√∂nerung der Wegelnburg\\" formed around the year 1860. Veterans of the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871) formed \\"Kriegskameradschaft Sch√∂nau\\" in 1904. In the same year also a local's group and an administration office of the ‚Äúfederation of Christian building craftsmen and assistant building laborer of Germany‚Äù developed in Sch√∂nau. In 1912 came the establishment of the cyclist association \\"Waldeslust\\". Between the First and Second World Wars, several church sponsored associations existed in Sch√∂nau . Kirchenchor (Pfarrc√§cilienverein) young man's association, a trade association as well as the trombone choir Sch√∂nau/Hirschthal, and in 1928 the ‚ÄúGerman youth strength‚Äù (DJK) which consisted of a track-and-field events and a football department.

Patterned after the British Post Office's Prestel system, it started as a videotex service requiring users to have a special terminal, the AT&T; Sceptre. As home computers became important in the marketplace, the development focus shifted to IBM, Apple, Commodore and other personal computers. Viewtron differed from contemporary services like CompuServe and The Source by emphasizing news from The Miami Herald and Associated Press and e-commerce services from JCPenney and other merchants over computer-oriented services such as file downloads or online chat. Intended to be \\"the McDonald's of videotex,\\" Viewtron was specifically targeted toward users who would be apprehensive about using a computer. Viewtron also offered airline schedules from the Official Airline Guide (OAG), real estate research from Century 21, e-cards from Hallmark, product information from Consumer Reports, educational software from Scott Foresman, online auctions, financial services from American Express and EF Hutton, as well as limited online banking services as part of a research program into the uses and costs of banking online that included 20 US and Canadian banks. At its height, Viewtron was operated in at least 15 cities by various newspaper companies. After six years of research and an investment reportedly in excess of $50 million, Viewtron never turned a profit, and, despite its developer's forecasts of breaking even in two years, Knight Ridder did not expect it ever would be profitable. AT&T; had invested over $100 million in the project, but was forced to write off that investment as part of its court-ordered breakup. Viewtron closed on March 31, 1986, after an attempt by the Independent Commodore Users Group to buy the service failed.Negotiations to buy Viewtron fail: Knight-Ridder shuts down service, InfoWorld, April 7, 1986, p. 16 A feature tying Viewtron to local newspapers was envisioned, with printed text instructing users how to access further information online, but it was never implemented. In 2008, PCWorld magazine named Viewtron to a list of the biggest project failures in information technology (IT) history. Technical details Hosted on a fault-tolerant Tandem/16 minicomputer, Viewtron used the NAPLPS graphics language to provide a user interface that was graphically sophisticated by the standards of the time. According to Chip Bok, screens were crafted so as they loaded, elements would be drawn in sequence, \\"the way you would tell a story.\\" Unlike HTML, NAPLPS allowed screen elements that remained unchanged through different pages of a story to remain static, an important concern with the low bandwidth 300-2400 baud modems then in use. Despite being initially restricted to the chiclet keyboard-equipped AT&T; Sceptre terminal, Viewtron's developers foresaw that general purpose personal computers would soon become the preferred way to consume online content. The Viewtron software was written from the beginning to be easily portable, and the work was able to be completed within 24 hours after the decision to refocus on home computer development. Viewtron did not initially allow users to send private messages to each other, a conscious decision by Knight Ridder to exert editorial control. Knight Ridder's vision for the service was offering products and services for users to consume, not in providing a medium for communication. When interactive features were later added, Knight Ridder discouraged their use, fearing that users interacting directly with each other would lead to a \\"dystopia without newspapers.\\" Service history Known as \\"Bowsprit\\", Viewtron underwent a test period in 125 upper-income homes in Coral Gables, Florida from 1980-1981, where it was determined that customers would pay up to $600 for the required terminal. The stability of the Southern Bell phone system that would carry the data was also a factor in the launch location. The service went live in south Florida (Dade, Broward, Monroe, and Palm Beach counties) on October 30, 1983. Viewtron expanded to include all of Florida in 1984 and to other U.S. cities by 1985. After Viewtron went national, its subscriber base quickly grew from 3,000 users to 20,000. Despite its rapid growth, Viewtron soon learned that the majority of users dropped their subscriptions after six months, and the most used areas of the service among the remaining users were not Viewtron's news feeds, but the email and live chat. At the service's introduction, customers could buy the AT&T; terminal but after May 1984 it was only offered for rental at $39.95 per month, which included a subscription to the service. Other customers paid $12 per month, plus a $1 hourly charge for access. After October 1985, Viewtron was carried nationally over the Tymnet, Telenet, and Uninet time sharing networks in the US, and by Datapac in Canada at a surcharge of 9 cents per minute on nights and weekends, and 22 cents per minute on weekdays. Demise Shortly after Viewtron's launch, Vice President Reid Ashe circulated a memo noting slower than expected sales and infrequent usage patterns. The memo drew the conclusion that people saw the service as a \\"toy\\" and weren't integrating Viewtron into their daily news routine. A crossed out statement in the memo discussed the differences between the newspaper business and online information delivery, noting the latter's lower cost of entry, lower profit margins, and likely increased competition. The act of crossing out this statement has been taken as a sign of Knight Ridder's unwillingness to recognize the changes in the news business that new technology was bringing and called into question Knight Ridder's intentions for Viewtron. On March 31, 1985 the group within Knight Ridder responsible for developing Viewtron wrote Knight Ridder's board of directors advocating a new direction, one that pursued business and personal computer applications. The memo recommended lowering the monthly price of the service, discontinuing the AT&T; terminal to concentrate on home computer development, and conducting another review in six months. The memo pointed out that this direction was preferable because it would compete with the newspapers less than the existing service. Viewtron's downfall came when Knight Ridder discovered at the end of 1985 that, despite the bulk of its expenses going toward the service's news feeds, users were spending most of their online time using Viewtron's less-profitable email, message boards, and educational areas. Instead of effectively becoming an online service provider, Knight Ridder decided to concentrate on its core news business, and Viewtron was discontinued on March 31, 1986. According to Philip Meyer, director of News and Circulation Research for Knight Ridder at the time, \\"We made the mistake of thinking in newspaper analogies. Thus the central computer was like a printing press in our minds, and telephone wires were the delivery trucks... . As newspaper people, we were looking for a community-based natural monopoly, like a newspaper, but without the variable costs of paper, ink, and transportation.\\" Reception Ahoy! praised Viewtron in its November 1985 issue, citing e-commerce, chat, news, and games as strengths and adding that the service had \\"the best customer service department it has ever been my pleasure to call.\\" References External links *David Carlson's Online Timeline - The 1980s *AT&T; Archives: Viewtron Introduction, from the Viewdata Corporation *AT&T; Archives: The Viewtron System and Sceptre Videotex Terminal (1983) *Henry Urrows, Floridians experiment with videotex buying, InfoWorld, April 9, 1984 *NS 2852: Tech before its time (six articles) * Knightfall: Knight Ridder And How The Erosion Of Newspaper Journalism Is Putting Democracy at Risk Category:Videotex Category:Knight Ridder Category:AT&T; Category:Pre‚ÄìWorld Wide Web online services Category:American journalism Category:Corporate spin-offs ","title":"Viewtron"},{"id":"13080876","text":"Trulben is a municipality in S√ºdwestpfalz district, in Rhineland-Palatinate, western Germany and belongs to the municipal association Pirmasens-Land.

The NCAA banned the use of tinted and reflective visors in 2006.Keep On Tickin‚Äô Posted 2006-08-25: The NCAA hopes its new rules shorten games this season. An eyeshield is a piece of football equipment that is also referred to as a visor that was created in the 1980s. In the mid 1900s as an effort to prevent brain and head injuries, headgear became mandatory in the game of football. was created to protect the eyes of football players during games and practices. It is a curved piece of plastic that attaches to the front of a football helmet. Safety equipment such as the facemask, eyeshields, and other face shields have been adopted over time to prevent player injury. The eyeshield leaves the mouth exposed, but covers the eyes and nose. The piece of equipment is made from various materials and by many different brands. Only clear eyeshield's are permitted for use in high school football games due to the fact that eyes are needed to be seen while checking for a concussion. For college level players, the eyeshield may be tinted for players with eye problems.  Production  The first football visors were made by Oakley. Eyeshield's can be made out of plutonite, which is a synthetic material that contributes to its great durability compared to other eyeshield's made out of polycarbonate. The eye wear can also be injection-molded, which gives curvature and allows the lenses to reflect glare and enable the players to have increased visibility in most weather conditions. But most eyeshield's are made out of polycarbonate. All visors are made curved in order to cover the entire eye area, shielding it from injury and light. Other well-known brands of eyeshield's include Nike, Under Armour. To provide a clear view, most eyeshield's are wrapped. Another way of providing a clear view to players is using APVX material, which also makes the lens less likely to crack. A shock dampening attachment reduces damage to the eyewear, making it strong and able to withstand hard impact. Most eyeshield's are created universal so they can fit almost all helmets and do not require special tools to install. Most tinted visors come in 20,45, and 60 percent.[6] Polarized tints block different UVA, UVC, and UVB rays and harmful blue lights. Eyeshield's come in a variety of shades: amber, blue, metallic silver and golds, black, polarized and even rainbow.  Rules  Only clear eyeshield's are permitted in high school football due to the fact that eyes are needed to be seen while checking for a concussion. For college level players, the eyeshield may be tinted for players with eye problems. The NFL allows dark visors to be worn and reflective mirrors but does not allow colored or iridium visors. Tinted visors were banned from the NFL for 20 years until 2019 when they became legal again.  Durability  The durability of eyeshield's were tested when eye specialists at Ohio State University used an air cannon to hurl baseballs at the visors. The impact was designed to mimic a force similar to being kicked in the face, a common occurrence during football play. The tested shields successfully maintained their structural integrity after being hit with baseballs that were propelled at velocities of up to 218 ft per second (150 miles per hour).  Adjustments  In 2019, optometrists and ophthalmologists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham worked together with BlazerAthletics to not only create visors to help vision- challenged football players, but also adjusted the rule book to allow players with eye problems to be able to wear the eyeshields during games. The special visors will assist football players that have medical-related light sensitivity to be able to play the game. Taylon Lewis, 11 at the time, was greatly impacted by this. He was born with albinism and suffers from light sensitivity due to the fact he naturally has no melanin in either of his iris' to block the sun.

Operation aims and outcome The aim of the operation was primarily political: * To persuade Romanian politicians, especially Iuliu Maniu, the leader of the National Peasants' Party, to negotiate an armistice with the Allied Powers. * In case they were captured by authorities loyal to the Antonescu government, to convince the Romanian authorities during their interrogation, that the allies were preparing to land in the Balkans, hoping that this would induce a concentration of German troops to the east, reducing their firepower in Normandy. On the night of 22 December 1943 the three agents were parachuted into thick fog and some distance away from the target. They were captured by Romanian gendarmerie almost immediately near the locality of Plosca, Teleorman County. They were held as well-treated prisoners of war at the Gendarmerie headquarters in Bucharest under the care of General Constantin Tobescu, Major Constantin C. Ro»ôescu and of Major Eugen Dobrogeanu. Churchill promptly sent a message to Marshal Ion Antonescu warning him that should the British prisoners fall into German hands he would be held personally responsible.

The British prisoners were released and that evening the King arranged for de Chastelain to fly to Istanbul from where he could go to Cairo and London to report. Me»õianu stayed on for a time and then returned to England. Porter remained to maintain a radio link with SOE Headquarters until the British mission arrived. He later worked at the Legation and in 1948 returned to London to the Foreign Office. Aftermath After the start of the Cold War, Soviet authorities alleged that de Chastelain was keeping contacts with Maniu, the leader of the National Peasants' Party; the latter had opposed both Antonescu's regime and the Soviet occupation of Romania. During Maniu's trial for treason in 1947, the Minister of the Interior, Teohari Georgescu, was handed a report which indicated Maniu's alleged contacts with de Chastelain as proof that the politician was a British spy. Reportedly, Cpt. Me≈£ianu visited Romania at least once during the Cold War and visited major Ro»ôescu at home. In 1989, Porter's book Operation Autonomous: With SOE In Wartime Romania was published by Chatto and Windus. The translation of this book in Romanian was published by Humanitas in 1991. In 2011, Porter attended the festivities of the Royal Jubilee, held in Bucharest, on the occasion of King Michael's 90th anniversary.

Childhood and Arts Education Robert Ekman was born in Uusikaupunki, Finland to an upper-class family. His father was , a medical doctor and a mayor, and his mother was Sara Elisabet (maiden name Gadolin). Both of his parents died when he was approximately 10 years old. They left behind five orphans who were placed in foster homes. Their schooling was incomplete and there was no chance of higher academic education. Robert Ekman first studied art under the guidance of Finnish painter Gustaf Wilhelm Finnberg (1784‚Äì1833), but in 1824 together with his brother Fredric, Joachim begun studies at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm and later studied in the studio of Johan Gustaf Sandberg (1782‚Äì1854). Already as a student Ekman specialized in portraying the life of the common people, instead of Classicism of the academic arts. Ekman graduated in 1836, and was granted a generous traveling scholarship for excelling in his studies. This supported him working in the Netherlands, France and Italy between years 1837‚Äì1844. As the scholarship was not plausible otherwise, Ekman took Swedish citizenship. Court Painter and a Teacher Upon returning to Stockholm, Ekman was dubbed as an agr√© (member candidate) and was accepted as a member of the academy in 1844. The title included the one of royal court and history painter. In 1845 Ekman returned to Turku, where he began decorating the Turku Cathedral with wall paintings. The laborious fresco were finished in 1854. Additionally, he completed over 30 church altarpieces during his career including works at Helsinki (1846‚Äì1848), S√§√§ksm√§ki (1847), Viitasaari (1849), Sauvon (1853), Oulu (1859), Tammela (1860), Vaasa (1861), Pori (1863), Paimio (1865), Tyrv√§√§ (1866) and Perelt (1871).

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kelberg, whose seat is in the like-named municipality.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Eifel between Kelberg and Daun on the river Lieser, and more specifically in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  History  In the Middle Ages, Beinhausen belonged to the Amt of Daun in the Electorate of Trier. On 10 August 1290, Beinhausen had its first documentary mention as Beinchenhusen. A later source speaks of Beyirhusen, and later still, a 1504 purchase agreement names a one ‚ÄúClais van Beyhusen‚Äù as well as the ‚ÄúKirchenmeister (a title now no longer used, but akin to ‚Äúsexton‚Äù) from Hilgenrait‚Äù. Under Prussian administration, the municipality was in the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Sarmersbach. Beinhausen is overwhelmingly Catholic and is the parochial seat of the Parish of St. Hubertus Beinhausen, to which, besides Beinhausen itself, belong the villages of Boxberg, Neichen, Kradenbach, Nerdlen, Sarmersbach and Gefell. Until the early 20th century, Katzwinkel also belonged to the Hilgerath parish (as it was once known). The Beinhausen parish area is also commonly called Struth. The Hilgerath parish church, standing alone on the mountain within Neichen's municipal limits, has been parish church since days of yore. The tower is known from its design to be from the mid 15th century; the main nave has existed in its current form since 1804. In 1950, the church was widened with two side naves. In more recent times, the return of the Hilgerath Gnadenbild (variously translated ‚Äúholy picture‚Äù or ‚Äúimage of grace‚Äù, among othersGnadenbild variously translated), Beweinung Christi (‚ÄúLamentation of Christ‚Äù) from the mid 15th century might be noted in the history books. This had been stolen from the parish church in a burglary in 1975 and thereafter its whereabouts were unknown. In 1994, Bernhard Euteneuer, who from 1992 to 2000 was the Beinhausen parish priest, managed to fetch the valuable Gnadenbild back to Hilgerath from Biberach an der Ri√ü, where it had resurfaced. To show their thankfulness, the Struth Catholics have ever since undertaken a yearly pilgrimage in which they converge on Hilgerath, always on the Sunday after the Feast of the Cross (14 September). In the course of municipal restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, the municipality was assigned in 1970 to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kelberg.  Religion  More than 90% of the inhabitants belong to the Roman Catholic Church.  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: In Silber ein gr√ºner Berg, darin ein silberenes Haus, dar√ºber ein schwarzer, hersehender Hirschkopf mit rotem Kreuz. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent in base a mount vert surmounted by a house of the field, above the mount a stag's head caboshed sable, between his attires a Latin cross gules. The stag's head and the cross are references to Saint Hubert, the parish's patron saint. The green mount in base is meant to represent the hill of Hilgerath, upon which the parish church stands. The house surmounting the mount is meant to represent the village of Beinhausen, which lies at the foot of the hill. It also symbolizes the placename element ‚Äîhausen.

Rolf Evert Kullberg (3 October 1930 in Pojo, Finland ‚Äì 3 September 2007 in Helsinki) was the Governor of the Bank of Finland from 1983 to 1992. He was a member of the board since 1974. Before that he worked in the ministry of finance and in a private bank. At the end of his term as a governor Finland experienced its worst recession. Before the recession there was a long period of growth and it was easy to borrow money. Kullberg was one of the first persons to publicly warn about the possible risks. He warned that people and companies are borrowing more than they can afford. During those hard times the main goal of the Bank of Finland was to maintain stable currency rate. Kullberg tied the currency rate of Finland's markka to ECU currency in 1991 in order to gain more stability. But finally Finland was forced to devaluate and eventually let its currency float in 1992. This was a serious setback to Kullberg and he wanted to resign from his post. However, the president of Finland Mauno Koivisto asked him to continue. In the April 1992 he made an early retirement after publicly disagreeing with the prime minister Esko Aho about financial politics. He died 3 September 2007 at the age of 76 after a serious illness.

History  In 1121, Berndorf had its first documentary mention. Beginning in the 14th century, Berndorf ‚Äì then still known as ‚ÄúBerendorf‚Äù ‚Äì belonged to the Electorate of Trier, and more locally to the Amt of Hillesheim. According to a ‚Äúpatronage under oath‚Äù undertaken by two Amtm√§nner (Amt officials) in 1379, the Margraves of J√ºlich also exercised their rights in ‚ÄúBerendorf‚Äù. In connection with the Napoleonic Wars, the region came to be under French administration in 1794, and from 1798 onwards belonged to the canton of Daun in the Department of Sarre. After the Rhineland passed to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815 under the terms of the treaties concluded at the Congress of Vienna, Berndorf belonged to the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Kerpen in the district of Daun, itself newly created in 1816.

Culture and sightseeing   Buildings  The village's character centres on the Romanesque fortress church at Kiefernstra√üe 4, which today serves as a graveyard chapel. It is a small, aisleless structure from between 1513 and 1515 with a walled churchyard. The west tower is from 1545. It has 14 Stations of the Cross, and also a warriors‚Äô memorial from the First World War.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Eifel on the upper Kyll, halfway between Trier and Cologne. It is linked to the outside world by Bundesstra√üe 421 and the Cologne-Trier railway (Lissendorf station).  Geology  The municipality belongs to the Kalkeifel (‚ÄúLimestone Eifel‚Äù) and lies on the southern edge of the Dollendorf Limestone Basin (Dollendorfer Kalkmulde). The elevation ranges from about 400 m above sea level on the Kyll at Crumpsm√ºhle to about 526 m above sea level at the Hirzberg (mountain). Geologically, three formations characterize the municipality. The outliers of the Middle Devonian limestone basin in the north, the bunter in the middle and the east and the sediments of the Kyll in the west. Arising from this are the great amounts of groundwater found here, which supply not only Birgel but also other municipalities in the Verbandsgemeinde of Obere Kyll with drinking water.

In 1457, Gerhard von Loen, Count of Blankenheim, acquired half an estate in Birgel. As well, the Lords of Mirbach had ownership rights in the village, as they styled themselves ‚ÄúLords of Birgel‚Äù in one document from the 16th century. In that same century, Birgel ended up in the power of the County of Gerolstein. The Elector of Trier owned his own fief in the village. The Electoral-Trier Amtmann (Amt official) at Daun received annuities from Birgel. Foremost among the rulers, however, remained the Counts of Blankenheim-Manderscheid-Gerolstein. On the occasion of an agreement in 1547, it was decided that Birgel belonged in Gerolstein's hands. In the 19th century, Birgel became the seat of the Lissendorf-Birgel Amt administration. The administration bore the title ‚ÄúAmt Lissendorf in Birgel‚Äù. In the course of administrative restructuring, the formerly self- administering √Ñmter of Stadtkyll and Lissendorf-Birgel were dissolved, and Birgel was grouped into the newly formed Verbandsgemeinde of Obere Kyll with its seat at J√ºnkerath.Gerten, H√∂ser, Wisniewski: Die Kyll (2006) In 2006, the municipality of Birgel received first place in the contest Unser Dorf hat Zukunft (‚ÄúOur Village Has a Future‚Äù) in the Vulkaneifel (then still Daun) district's main class.  Population development  In 1960, Birgel had roughly 520 inhabitants. The population peaked in 1990 at about 590 inhabitants. Currently, roughly 540 people have a primary or secondary residence in Birgel.

Lindenquelle  The Lindenquelle lies roughly 4 km north of Birresborn on the way to Gerolstein. The Quelltempel still standing here is under monumental protection, and since 3 July 2009, has been being restored. Moreover, the mineral water is once more gushing forth. The contamination that ended the Adonis Quelle‚Äôs usefulness has not affected the Lindenquelle. Here, one can drink water free of charge and also fill up on it the year round.  Conservation areas  Nature conservation areas exist at the Vulkan Kalem, at the ice caves and in the Fischbach valley, in the Felst and in the Hundsbach valley.  History  In 721, Birresborn had its first documentary mention under the name Birgisburias. The prefix Bir‚Äî is a word of Semitic origin. It means ‚Äúwell‚Äù or ‚Äúwatering place‚Äù. Commonly, however, Birgis-burias is translated as ‚ÄúGood Well‚Äù. On 15 June 1871, Birresborn was linked to the German railway network with the opening of the Eifelbahn between Gerolstein and Trier. On 14 May 1908, the Lindenquelle was acknowledged as a public utility. On 20 February 1914, the municipality's springs were recognized by the state as health springs. On Christmas Day 1944, not long before the Second World War ended, a great part of Birresborn was destroyed in an Allied air raid. Since 1971, Birresborn has been part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Gerolstein, in the Daun district, which is now known as the Vulkaneifel district. On 11 November 2003, the mineral spring Birresborner Ph√∂nix Sprudel was closed owing to contamination.

History  The village‚Äôs street layout was extensively remodelled in 2006. The costs were to a great extent borne by Borler‚Äôs citizens. All streets and paths were newly expanded. Streets with sidewalks, or pavements, on both sides were changed so that there was only one sidewalk. Leftover bits of land were given over to drought-resistant plants. The big playground in the middle of the village was converted to building land and replaced by a smaller playground behind the fire station. Today, many weekenders can be found in the village, including Belgians and people from the German urban agglomerations, such as the Ruhr area. Once, agriculture shaped village life. By means of the Marshall Plan, a grassland and research institute was established in Borler. In the course of time, the institute, which was run by the Chamber of Agriculture, was abandoned. Until the 1980s, dairy cattle characterized the agriculture. The fodder was grown on the neighbouring meadows and cropfields around the village. There still is agriculture, but it is now commercially quite secondary.

On the Heyerberg near the village once stood a castle with a chapel and also an estate. Their owner was St. Maximin‚Äôs Abbey in Trier, but the Abbey had enfeoffed the Knights of Heyer with them. History mentioned them with Wilhelm, Burgmann of Daun in 1359. The Knights‚Äô arms showed the five rings, or annulets, in the quincunx pattern, and in Borler‚Äôs arms, they appear in Electoral-Trier tinctures beneath the line of partition. Set into the chapel above the portal is a Rococo cartouche bearing St. Maximin‚Äôs arms. These show the two-headed (‚Äúbicapitate‚Äù) eagle above and a chalice below, along with three stars.

Heyerbergkapelle  The Heyerbergkapelle (also known as the Borler Kapelle) is a Romanesque Revival chapel built in 1875 some 1 200 m southeast of the village on the wooded Heyerberg (mountain). Before today‚Äôs chapel, the old Heyerkirche (church) once stood on this same spot, even before 1600. It was a castle chapel and the gravesite for the Lords of Heyer. Right nearby stood the Electoral-Cologne Haus Heyer and the Electoral-Trier Hof Heyer. In the chapel, Saint Leonard, Saint Pancras and John the Baptist, whose statues are still preserved today, were revered. In the early 19th century, the chapel was first closed, and then in the years that followed, it was removed. Even the graveyard was closed in 1805, as Borler was part of the parish of Nohn, where the dead were thereafter buried. In 1874, on Borler citizens‚Äô initiative and with their donations, the new Heyerbergkapelle was built. The Romanesque Revival building with its semicircular apse was dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows. At the church, restored in 1952, is a Way of the Cross, created in 1878, with 14 stations laid out with the distances proportional to the ones on the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem.Die Heyerkirche in: Festschrift zum Pfarrfest in Nohn anl√§sslich des 200j√§hrigen Bestehens der jetzigen Kirche St. Martin und des 180j√§hrigen Pfarrjubil√§ums 1981; Pfarrgemeinderat Nohn, Selbstverlag 1981; S. 57-58 File:Heyerbergkapelle-1.jpg|Heyerbergkapelle File:Heyerbergkapelle- Kreuzweg.jpg|Way of the Cross File:Heyerbergkapelle-Kreuzwegstele.jpg|Stele on the Way of the Cross File:Heyerbergkapelle-2.jpg|Heyerbergkapelle  Buildings  * Saint Leonard‚Äôs Catholic Church (branch church), Hauptstra√üe 3, aisleless church from 1752‚Äì1753, shaft cross from 1790, 1914-1918 warriors‚Äô memorial * Bachgasse 3 ‚Äì small timber-frame house, partly plastered * Hauptstra√üe 1 ‚Äì timber-frame house, 18th-19th century, knee wall raised in the 20th century * Hauptstra√üe 10 ‚Äì timber-frame house, partly solid, roof with half-hipped gables, latter half of the 18th century * Kapellenweg 3 ‚Äì building with roof with half-hipped gables, apparently from 1825 * Heyerbergkapelle or Borler Kapelle (see above), six small basalt crosses from 1761, 1756, 1699, 1779, 1699 and 1788Directory of Cultural Monuments in Vulkaneifel district  References   External links  * Municipality‚Äôs official webpage * Borler in the collective municipality‚Äôs Web pages Category:Vulkaneifel ","title":"Borler"},{"id":"13081057","text":"Boxberg is an Ortsgemeinde ‚Äì a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì in the Vulkaneifel district in Rhineland- Palatinate, Germany.

Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  History  On 9 June 1161, Brockscheid had its first documentary mention when Pope Victor IV approved for the Abbey of Echternach the proclamation of Christ's teaching in Broxsceith (Brockscheid) and Texscith (Tettscheid). Brockscheid was very small at this time, and indeed until 1654, there were only five hearths in the village. Even so, Brockscheid was not without a place of worship, with a church being mentioned as early as 1238. The parish of Brockscheid came to include Udler and Tettscheid in 1804, an arrangement that still stands today. In 1862, the Magi were cast aside as the village's patrons, with their place taken by Saint Ursula. Also bound with the village's history is the old, now ruined, castle, Burg Freudenstein, whose remnants can still be seen in the woods. There does not seem to have been any official link between this castle and the village, however. The castle was mentioned about 1340 as belonging to the Counts of Luxembourg, although Brockscheid itself was within the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun. In 1840, a new industry cropped up in Brockscheid that brought the municipality some measure of fame. August Mark founded a foundry where bells were poured, and indeed the industry continues today with two such foundries in the municipality.History ‚Äì Choose Kultur, and then click on Geschichte.

The tinctures argent and gules (silver and red) refer to the village's former status as a municipality within the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun. Below the bar, the tinctures are Or and gules (gold and red), which were those borne by the old Lords of Daun in their arms. These lords had patronage rights at the local church.

The Canadian Air Force pilot and the U.S. Navy passenger, who was taking photographs of the ship, reportedly suffered eye pain and injuries consistent with laser exposure. However, subsequent investigations into the incident were unable to verify that any lasing had occurred. Background Responding to a request based on previous suspicious activity of the Kapitan Man, the Canadian Forces dispatched a CH-124 helicopter to fly by the ship and take photographs of it and its abnormal aerial antenna structure, which was indicative of a ship that could be conducting ELINT or SIGINT activities. The U.S. Coast Guard had previously confiscated submarine surveillance equipment from the ship in 1993. At the time of the incident, the Kapitan Man was north of Port Angeles, Washington i.e. inside U.S. territorial waters. On board the aircraft were U.S. Navy Lieutenant Jack Daly and Canadian Forces pilot Captain Patrick Barnes. Lt. Daly was the Navy's foreign-intelligence liaison officer in Esquimalt, British Columbia, heading a joint U.S.-Canadian helicopter- surveillance operation against Russian, Chinese, and other spy ships operating in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which separates the Canadian province of British Columbia from the U.S. state of Washington, and in Puget Sound, the site of major U.S. nuclear ballistic missile submarine and aircraft carrier bases with the Royal Canadian Navy Pacific Fleet Headquarters in Esquimalt Harbour near Victoria, B.C. Laser damage While taking photographs of the ship and its bridge, Lt. Daly suddenly experienced intense pain in his right eye as well as temporary blindness. After examination, it was concluded that Daly suffered direct laser burns to his right eye, as well as other vision problems and severe headaches. Daly testified that Capt. Barnes was also injured in a similar manner and was permanently grounded as a result of this incident; he has since lost all his flight qualifications. A United States Army Medical Research Department analysis indicated that the crew was most likely hit with a Nd:YAG laser. In February 1999, Daly testified before the U.S. House Armed Services Committee about his experience. He said that he and Capt. Barnes both had extreme sensitivity to sunlight and light sources. Driving at night became impossible as did watching movies or night ball games: \\"The only form of even momentary relief that either one of us can rely on is sitting in the dark with our eyes closed, yet lately even that does not seem to help much.\\" In the same time period, he discussed his case on the ABC News program 20/20, saying \\"I've been in constant pain since the 4th of April '97, without a moment's relief.\\" Kapitan Man search Shortly after the incident, U.S. Coast Guard teams were given two hours to search the vessel but did not locate a laser. Teams were not given full access to the ship, however, and the Clinton administration had warned the Russian government in advance the ship would be searched. Lawsuit and Purple Heart request In October 2002, Daly sued the Russian Far East Shipping Company (FESCO), owner of the Kapitan Man, in federal court. In his opening statement, Daly's lawyer laid out their side of the case. The company's lawyer countered that there was no positive evidence of a laser on the ship. The jury deliberated for a day and ruled that the laser attack could not be linked to FESCO. Daly's lawyer told the press that the case was hampered by U.S. government resistance and unfavorable rulings by the judge. In September 2004, the Chief of Naval Operations denied an Inspector General's recommendation that Daly be awarded the Purple Heart (for wounds sustained by opposing forces). Part of the CNO's rejection stated: Clinical assessment The case was analyzed in the August 2004 Archives of Ophthalmology by medical laser researchers including Dr. Bruce Stuck, then Director of the U.S. Army Medical Research Detachment of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, responsible for the Army Medical Department's laser and radio frequency radiation biological effects research program.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. The Alfbach also rises nearby.  History  Darscheid‚Äôs parish and school chronicle tells a story about how the three villages in the Alfbach‚Äôs headwaters came into being. Three brothers, the reader is told, came and settled here from faraway lands and divided the land amongst themselves, saying ‚ÄúHier ist ein Scheid, da ist ein Scheid und unten ist f√ºr alle ein Scheid.‚Äù (‚ÄúHere is a share, there is a share and below is for all a share‚Äù). From these ‚Äúshares‚Äù or ‚Äúsplits‚Äù arose three farms that later grew into villages: H√∂rscheid (Hier + Scheid), Darscheid (Da + Scheid) and Allscheid (Alle + Scheid). More steadily based in historical fact, though, is the Celtic presence in the area. They settled the Eifel as livestock raisers, and it may be assumed that they were in what is now Darscheid as well, as witnessed by the barrows in the nearby Lehwald (woods), which were explored in the late 19th century and determined to date from the early Iron Age ‚Äì Hallstatt times. In the Middle Ages, Darscheid was quite a poor village out in the heath, like so many in the Eifel. Thatched timber-frame houses gathered around a 14th-century chapel. Darscheid had its first documentary mention in 1354, at which time it lay under the Counts of Daun. After they died out in 1420, the lordship passed to the Counts of Manderscheid. There followed a long period of serfdom, compulsory labour and economic woes. Even after serfdom was abolished, things got no better, and many people heeded the promises of a better life from Empress Maria Theresa‚Äôs settler recruiter in 1754 and left the village for a new life in Hungary. The 19th century brought the Eifel dwellers yet more in the way of economic hardship, leading to a further wave of emigration, this time to North America. About 1852, sixty-seven people left Darscheid and went abroad. Only in the 1890s did the situation begin to improve. The spruce trees that had been planted beginning in 1830 were at last yielding income. Farm work was made easier by the reorganization of splintered farmland into bigger plots. Chemical fertilizer boosted crop yields. Further jobs and therefore earnings came with the Daun-Darscheid-Mayen railway, completed in 1895. This also spurred growth in trade and transport, raising Darscheid, as a railway centre, to a higher economic position. This further allowed the municipality, among other things, to build a new school in 1901, the old timber-frame one, built in 1838, having outlived its usefulness. Over the next few decades, growth continued. The Lower Village swelled until it reached the railway track, a railway goods station opened, followed by a sawmill in 1919, there was electric light in 1921 and a public water supply by 1927. Between 1923 and 1924, three new bakehouses were built to afford the villagers a place to bake their bread. This was an important institution in those days, as people seldom had ovens in their own homes. Darscheid discovered tourism in 1924 when the youth hostel was opened. A census on 16 June 1933 showed that there were 409 inhabitants in Darscheid. At about this time, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and the Third Reich began. The onset of the Second World War depleted the ranks of working men as they were called into the Wehrmacht; jobs were taken over by women and older men. Also put to work were prisoners of war, both men and women, from Russia, France and Poland, who worked the land. Most of these were billeted with local families in the hope that the local husbands and sons fighting in the war would be well supplied by people in the occupied lands. After the war, agriculture began to lose its economic importance as the flight to the cities began. By about 1997, the last locally owned agricultural business was forsaken by its owner, and all farming in Darscheid is now handled by a large company. Furthermore, the old youth hostel closed in 1976 after 50 years and the building now houses a home for emotionally needy adults, as does the old railway station. This service is run by the Weggemeinschaft Vulkaneifel. The railway itself is still in use, but there are now only hourly local trains in the summer months. For a decade, between January 1991 and early 2001, there was no passenger service at all.Darscheid‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Municipal election ‚Äúresults‚Äù  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: In Gr√ºn ein goldener Schr√§glinksbalken, belegt mit einer roten Zickzackleiste.

In 1728, Demerath, Ambts Dauhn (that is, in the Amt of Daun) got a Polizey oder Dorfordnung (police force). In 1794 the village was occupied by French troops. About 1794, the so-called Freiheitseiche (‚ÄúFreedom Oak‚Äù) was planted. In 1803, Demerath was raised to a parish in its own right. Beginning in 1815, after Prussian rule had begun, Demerath belonged to the Daun district. In 1841, the municipality received a new police force for the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Gillenfeld. From 1904, there was telephone service in Demerath. In 1920, the volunteer fire brigade was founded, as was the music club in 1960. In 1970, the local school was dissolved, and in 2003, the ailing Freedom Oak was felled and a new one was planted.http://www.demerath-eifel.de/images/Geschichte_Demerath.PDF  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Municipal election ‚Äúresults‚Äù  Mayor  Demerath's mayor is Horst Becker.

In its composition, the municipal arms go back to the French Revolution. The tinctures gules and argent (red and silver) in the chief stand as a reminder of the municipality's former allegiance to the Electorate of Trier. The key and the sword refer to the local patron saints, Peter and Paul. The stone in the base is a representation of the court stone before the church, and the oak sprig above stands for the Freiheitseiche (‚ÄúFreedom Oak‚Äù), planted in the time of French rule, under which this court stone stood. The high court that sat here carried out its death and mutilation penalties upon this stone.

Built in 1927 of red brick, it was designed in a mixture of the Colonial Revival and Georgian Revival styles by noted Boston architects Ripley and LeBoutillier, and is the city's most architecturally sophisticated early 20th-century school building. It is a large two-story structure, set on a raised basement, which is demarcated by a granite water table. Its main facade has a central five-bay section with a gable roof with a pedimented entry and a cupola atop the roof. This central section is flanked by eight-bay sections that are terminated in end pavilions with pediments above, and secondary entrances in the side facades. A two-story wing, apparently integral to the original construction extends to the rear of the central portion, and a later addition extends to the right rear. On March 16, 1990, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The school was closed in 1983.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town. In Deudesfeld, Moselle Franconian is spoken. Parish church in Deudesfeld  Geography   Location  The municipality lies in the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth.  Constituent communities  The municipality is made up of the main centre, likewise called Deudesfeld, and the outlying centre (Ortsteil) of Desserath, as well as the homesteads of Mausensm√ºhle and Turnerm√ºhle.  History  Deudesfeld, formerly Dudensvelt, Dudenesfelt or Dudesfeld, gets its name from the Frankish given name Dedin with the placename ending ‚Äîfeld (‚Äúfield‚Äù). The customary dialectal name Deisselt is actually a corruption of the name Desserath (formerly Deissilrod), an outlying centre. Finds of golden coins, potsherds and bits of tools dating from Roman times have led to the conclusion that there was already a settlement of some kind here as early as the 3rd century. Deudesfeld had its first documentary mention in 1171 when the knight Ludwig von Deudesfeld was mentioned by name as a witness. Among other things, the founding of the Cistercian Saint Thomas's Convent on the Kyll can be traced back to him in connection with an extensive donation that brought Deudesfeld a dependence lasting centuries. Only when the convent's holdings were sold off under French rule, which began in 1794, was the bond with the ecclesiastical order broken. Deudesfeld's allegiance to the Electorate of Trier also ended with the coming of the French. Over the centuries, Deudesfeld was not spared the evils that afflicted other communities. Witches were persecuted and the Plague swept through. In particular, though, the secular and ecclesiastical authorities led to exploitation and repression. Sackings and atrocities in mediaeval wars only made the suffering keener. In the 17th century, the village was even emptied for seven years as the villagers hid themselves in the woods to survive. Even in Napoleonic times, when French troops came marching in, things got no better; the consequences were taxes payable to the French state, and young men being pressed into the Revolutionary army. Further hardship came on 12 September 1888 when, within a few hours, a great fire destroyed the whole southwestern part of the village, burning 21 houses (out of 80 all together) and 24 barns and stables to rubble and ashes. The earlier half of the 20th century was characterized foremost by the two World Wars and their aftermath, even for those living in a small village in the Eifel like Deudesfeld. Reconstruction after the Second World War brought along with it a far-reaching change in structure. While until the mid 20th century the villagers had mainly been small farmers, craftsmen and forestry workers, this has over the last few decades undergone a sweeping change. In 1956 there were still 56 agricultural businesses in Deudesfeld. Today, however, the Hochscheider Hof is the only one left that is run as a full-time operation. Since that time, tourism has also earned significant importance for Deudesfeld as one of the municipality's main income earners. This has been favoured by state recognition of Deudesfeld as a recreation municipality, as well as by its location in the wooded Vulkaneifel with its well linked hiking trails and its many nearby outing destinations.Deudesfeld‚Äôs history ‚Äì Click on Geschichte.

The bend (slanted stripe) with the checkerboard pattern above the line of partition is the charge borne by the Cistercian order, who held the convent founded by Ludwig von Deudesfeld. The tools below the line of partition stand for the municipality's longtime patrons, the Apostles Simon and Jude; their attributes are carpentry tools.

Circa 510-480 BC. Mende (), also Mendae or Mendai (ŒúŒ≠ŒΩŒ¥Œ±Œπ), or Menda (ŒúŒ≠ŒΩŒ¥Œ±),Polyaen. 2.1.21; Suda s.v. or Mendis, was an ancient Greek city located on the western coast of the Pallene peninsula in Chalkidiki, facing the coast of Pieria across the narrow Thermaic Gulf and near the modern town of Kalandra.  Ancient History  Map of the Delian League (Athenian Empire) showing Mende. Mende was probably built during the 9th century BC by Eretrian colonists. The city owes its name to the minthe plant, a species of mint that still sprouts in the area. Mende's abundant lumber resources and possession of silver, gold and lead mines led to its rapid development. From the 6th century BC, it was one of the cities that controlled trade routes along the coast of Thrace; there were even confirmed dealings with the Greek colonies in Italy, especially concerning the export of the famous local wine Mendaeos oinos. During the 5th century BC, Mende became one of the most important allies of Athens and joined the Delian League, paying a tax that varied from six up to fifteen Attic talents per year. However, in 423 BC, it managed to revolt against Athenian rule, a situation that did not last long as the Athenians quickly suppressed the revolt (Thuc. iv. 121). During the Peloponnesian War, Mende, Toroni and Skione were the main regional goals of the two combatants, Athens and Sparta, specially after Brasidas,the Spartan general, raised an army of allies and helots and went for the sources of Athenian power in north Greece in 424. After the end of the war, Mende regained its independence. The city tried to avoid Olynthian rule in the 4th century BC, when the Chalkidician League was established; later it tried to avoid rule by the Macedonian hegemony, but in 315 its population, along with other Chalkidicians, was forced to resettle in Cassandreia, after this new city was built by king Cassander on the site of the former town of Poteidaea. The sculptor Paeonius, who made the statue of Nike that was put on top of the victory pillar in Olympia - and is shown in the Archaeological Museum of Olympia - was born in Mende.  Topography and archaeology  The location of Mende was identified with the area of the modern town of Kalandra by William Martin Leake in 1835. Systematic excavational research was conducted from 1986 to 1994 by the XVI Ephorate of Classical Antiquities. The main archaeological area covers an area of by and lies to the open and flat place of a hill by the sea. It was continuously inhabited from the 9th to the 4th century. The acropolis of the city is located to the south uppermost point of the hill, where large storage buildings among with pottery dated from the 11th to the 4th century, were found. The Proasteion (Suburb) of the city, which is also mentioned by Thucydides, occupied the waterfront area between the beach and the hill of the main city, where the harbour was located. Excavations revealed part of the main avenue, paved with pebbles, along with foundations of buildings with storage pottery, possibly shops or harbour buildings. The settlement's Necropolis was found south of the city, near a modern hotel. Excavations were made in 241 tombs that mainly revealed burials of children inside engraved ceramic vases. Those excavations are considered important mainly because they proved that a heavy Euboean influenced settlement was established already from the 11th century.

Critical reception  In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau deemed Real People a better record than Chic's Risqu√© (1979), even though it lacked a song as great as \\"Good Times\\". \\"Jumpy, scintillating rhythms fuse with elegantly abrasive textures for a funk that's not light but sharp\\", he wrote. \\"Plus post-chic words that go with the attention-grabbing heat and invention of Nile Rodgers's postrock guitar.\\" In his year-end list for the Pazz & Jop critics poll, Christgau named it the 15th best album of 1980. AllMusic's Alex Henderson was less impressed in a retrospective review, calling Real People a satisfactory effort but inessential, highlighted by \\"Rebels Are We\\", \\"I Got Protection\\", and \\"Chip off the Old Block\\", none of which he said were as good as Chic's past hits.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Daun, whose seat is in the like-named town.  Geography   Location  The municipality lies on the watershed between the Ahr and the Moselle in the heart of the Vulkaneifel, a part of the Eifel known for its volcanic history, geographical and geological features, and even ongoing activity today, including gases that sometimes well up from the earth. Dockweiler lies in the north of Rhineland-Palatinate at an elevation of roughly 500 to 560 m above sea level between Daun and Gerolstein.  Geology  A lava flow stretching from the Ernstberg (700 m) and across the Eselsberg (637 m), ending just before the neighbouring village of Dreis, forms the bedrock under Dockweiler.  History  In 1136, Dockweiler had its first documentary mention in the Springiersbach Monastery's directory of holdings. Finds of coins, Roman burial mounds and settlement centres near Dockweiler as well as the proximity to the former Meuse-Rhine and Meuse-Moselle Roman roads are taken as evidence of Dockweiler's founding going as far back as Roman times, although this cannot be confirmed. Quite early on, the village belonged to the County of Kerpen, which later passed to the County of the Lords of Manderscheid-Schleiden. In the 19th century, Dockweiler became a postal coach station, until 1895, when postal coaches were replaced by the railway; at this time, the Dockweiler/Dreis railway station also came into being.Dockweiler‚Äôs history  Politics   Municipal council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Municipal election ‚Äúresults‚Äù  Mayor  Dockweiler's mayor is Bruno von Landenberg.  Coat of arms  The German blazon reads: Unter rotem Schildhaupt, darin ein goldener Zickzackbalken, schr√§g links von Silber und Rot geteilt; vorn ein schwarzes Rost, hinten eine doppelbl√§ttrige, goldene Rose mit rotem Butzen. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per bend sinister argent a gridiron bendwise sinister sable and gules a rose with petals doubled Or seeded of the field, in a chief of the third a bar dancetty of three of the fourth. The narrow zigzag stripe (‚Äúbar dancetty‚Äù) stands for the centuries through which the Counts of Manderscheid held sway in Dockweiler. The gridiron is Saint Lawrence‚Äôs attribute, and as such symbolizes the church's and the municipality's patron saint. Dockweiler passed as the result of a noble bequest to the Duchy of Arenberg. The Dukes bore a charge of three roses in their arms, and the rose in Dockweiler's arms recalls this time.Description and explanation of Dockweiler‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing  Near the Romanesque church, which was built about 1200, are found limetrees and chestnut trees some 200 years old, which are held to be natural monuments. In the Dockweiler Wald (forest) is an acidic mineral spring. South of the village lies a block lava field, another natural monument. Hikers can explore the woodlands in the Dockweiler-Daun-Kelberg triangle.  Buildings  * Saint Lawrence‚Äôs Catholic Parish Church, Pfarrer-Hubert-Schmitz-Stra√üe 5, may originally have been an aisleless church in the 11th century, expanded into a basilica towards the end of the 12th century, Romanesque Revival tower and nave expansion in 1903 and 1904, architect L. von Fisenne, Gelsenkirchen. * Dauner Stra√üe 21 ‚Äì former railway station, built to standard plans, early 20th century. * Gerolsteiner Stra√üe 4 ‚Äì timber-frame house, partly solid. * Gerolsteiner Stra√üe 5 ‚Äì Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street), Classicist motifs, from 1856. * Hauptstra√üe 24 ‚Äì plaster structure (former rectory?), perhaps from mid 19th century.Directory of Cultural Monuments in Vulkaneifel district  Economy and infrastructure   Transport   Road  Dockweiler is linked to the road network by Bundesstra√üen 421 and 410. The municipality is served by two regional bus routes, 500 / 9311 serving the route Gerolstein-Daun-Cochem, and, intermittently, 511 / 9367 running the J√ºnkerath-Hillesheim-Daun route.  Rail  The local railway service runs only from May to October to and from the old station on Dauner Stra√üe. Trains run scheduled daytime services to and from Gerolstein, Daun, Ulmen, Kaisersesch, Mayen and Andernach.

Seekonk was built in 1943 as Summit Springe (MC hull 902) under a Maritime Commission contract by the Marine Maintenance Corp., now East Coast Shipyards, Inc., Bayonne, New Jersey, launched on 24 May 1943 sponsored by Miss Gladys G. Merrick; and commissioned on 10 February 1944, Lt.(jg.) Albert E. Eldred, USNR, in command.  World War II service  Seekonk was the fourth of a group of small, single screw, engine-aft, diesel propelled tankers accepted by the Navy during World War II. After fitting out at Staten Island, New York; shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay; and post-shakedown availability at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Seekonk got underway in convoy on 22 March 1944 for Aruba, Netherlands West Indies. Putting into Nicolas Bay, Aruba, on 1 April, Seekonk loaded cargo, fuel, and aviation gasoline and departed the next day for the Panama Canal Zone. On 10 April, the gasoline tanker departed Balboa for New Guinea, arriving at Finschaven on 1 June.  South Pacific operations  For the remainder of 1944, Seekonk operated off the coast of New Guinea, visiting such ports as Madang, Hollandia, Sansapor, Mios Woendi, Biak, and Morotai. On 31 October, aided by harbor guns, the small oiler fought off four attacking Japanese planes off Soemoe Island, Morotai, Netherlands East Indies, and splashed two and possibly three of the attackers.  Serving Philippine invasion forces  From 7 January to 14 February 1945, Seekonk fueled a large share of the amphibious ships used in liberating Luzon and other islands of the Philippines. On the 18th, the gasoline tanker, towing Army crash boat, N6-1, took her position in convoy GI 11-(A) en route to Leyte, Philippines, and arrived at San Pedro Bay on 4 March.  End-of-war activity  Seekonk operated in the Philippine area until the cessation of hostilities in August. During this period the ship served as harbor oiler at Mindoro Island, Subic Bay, and Lingayen. From 28 August to 9 October, the ship fueled Task Group 71.2 as it was engaged in sweeping Allied and Japanese-laid mines from the approaches to Shanghai.  Post-war operations  On 10 October, Seekonk got underway with Task Group 73.14, assigned to clear the mines in Haiphong Harbor, French Indochina, and in the Hainan Strait. From 12 October, Seekonk had to be towed by (DE-677) due to a piston seizure in her main engine. On the 20th, she anchored off Doson Peninsula, Tonkin Gulf. Continuing the fueling of the task group, Seekonk was towed to the Norway Islands, Tonkin Gulf, on 24 October, and to Hainan on the 29th. On 2 November the gasoline tanker was towed to Han Dau Island, using her own engine part of the time. On 11 November, she got underway with Task Group 74.4 for Hong Kong. Towed part of the way, Seekonk arrived there on 15 November.  Continued engine problems  On 21 December, her main engine repaired, Seekonk departed Hong Kong en route to Pearl Harbor. On 26 December, however, her main engine was again disabled, and she limped toward Okinawa, assisted into Buckner Bay by (ATF-152) on the 29th.  Post-war decommissioning  Seekonk reached San Francisco, California, on 26 February 1946. She was decommissioned and stripped on 1 May 1946 and struck from the Navy list on 21 May 1946. The small oiler was turned over to the Maritime Commission as a usable vessel on 28 August 1946. Seekonk was fitted out and sold as a merchant vessel by the Maritime Commission. Seekonk was purchased on 28 January 1949 by Newfoundland Tankers Ltd., a subsidiary of Irving Oil. Under Irving ownership, the name was unchanged, and Seekonk sailed to eastern Canada where she worked in the Great Lakes on charter to British-American Oil Company for several seasons beginning in 1951. She later saw service for Irving Oil to ports in the Maritimes and Newfoundland and Labrador. On 7 June 1963 a fire broke out in the galley while Seekonk was in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada. Following several explosions, the fire spread throughout the aft end of the vessel, consuming the bridge, accommodations and engine room. The burning ship was towed from the pier by the Canadian Coast Guard's CCGS Tupper and was removed from the harbour; the Seekonk was beached on Governors Island in Hillsborough Bay where the fire burned out after two days. After the fire was out, Seekonk was towed to an Irving Oil dock in Buctouche, New Brunswick, Canada and later to Sydney Nova Scotia Charlottetown Guardian 26 June 1964 p.1 where she was broken up.  Military awards and honors  The U.S. Navy record does not indicate whether Seekonk was awarded battle stars. However, her crew was eligible for the following: * Combat Action Ribbon (retroactive) * China Service Medal (extended) * American Campaign Medal * Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal * World War II Victory Medal * Navy Occupation Service Medal (with Asia clasp) * Philippines Liberation Medal  References   External links  * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - AOG-20 Seekonk * Port Colborne Leader: Fire conked out the Seekonk Category:Mettawee-class gasoline tankers Category:Type T1-M-A2 tankers of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in Bayonne, New Jersey Category:1943 ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Maritime incidents in 1963 ","title":"USS Seekonk (AOG-20)"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(M,[["render",I]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/53.md","filePath":"quotes/53.md"}'),D={name:"quotes/53.md"},F=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{x as __pageData,F as default};
