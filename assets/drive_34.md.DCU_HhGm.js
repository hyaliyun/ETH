Bria later became the chief AP correspondent at the United Nations and retired in 1981. He also wrote gardening columns, tending to his own vegetable garden in Westchester County, New York, after retiring. Career Bria was born in Rome and immigrated with his family to Waterbury, Connecticut, at a young age. He graduated from Amherst College and Middlebury College and began his career as a journalist with the Waterbury Democrat and Hartford Courant. Bria was hired by the Boston AP bureau in 1942, reporting on the Cocoanut Grove fire.

Bria was flown to Milan in April 1945 to view the body of Benito Mussolini shortly after his execution, and was the first AP newsman to report on the surrender of German forces in Italy on May 2. After the war, Bria joined the post-war AP bureau in Germany, reporting on the Nuremberg trials and the Berlin airlift, before returning to Rome and New York.

She graduated in 1928, from the University of Oklahoma (OU), where she majored in art. Her teachers included Oscar Jacobsen and Edith Mahier, who considered her one of their most gifted students. She earned part of the money for her education by painting murals for a restaurant in Norman, Oklahoma, and a set of panels in the women's dormitory at OU.Lee, Eric McCauley. The Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art at the University of Oklahoma, 2004. p. 210. Available on Google Books. Retrieved March 18, 2017 Noted Oklahoma-born architect Bruce Goff discovered Hrdy's artistic talent one day while eating lunch at the OU women's dormitory and asked to meet the artist. They became friends and quickly began to collaborate, as he invited her to paint some murals for the Riverside Studio in Tulsa, which he was designing for a Tulsa musician. After that, he commissioned her to help decorate the Brady Theater in Tulsa (then known as the Tulsa Convention Hall). Her works at both sites have since disappeared. Hrdy moved for a while in the 1930s to New York City, where she applied her artistic talent in designing utilitarian objects like place mats, textiles, radios, wallpaper and even scarves. She was then invited to attend Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesen Studio in Wisconsin, but ended her visit there after three months. She moved to Southern California and worked for a while at the start of World War II, but quit her job and opened her own design studio. During this period, she also experienced a brief marriage that apparently ended in divorce. Later, she returned to live in her mother's home in Prague, where she died in 1987. Early life and education Olinka Hrdy was born August 7, 1902, in a one-room sod hut in Prague, Oklahoma to Josef Hrdy, an immigrant from Bohemia, and his wife, Emma, who was of Indian descent. She had two brothers: Carl, who was older and George, who was younger. Edvard Beneš, the second president of Czechoslovakia, was her second cousin. Her parents divorced when she was about sixteen, and she had no contact with her father after she left home for college. Wall, Holly. \\"Lost Olinka.\\" This Land. September 20, 2011.

She had become proficient in embroidery, which was traditionally practiced by Czech women in her home town. She saw this as a path to learning sewing. She learned instead that domestic arts was boring and switched her major to art at the end of her first semester. Hrdy said that she had only fifty dollars when she arrived at OU. An instructor, Edith Mayer, saw examples of her work and invited her to paint a mural in one of the School of Creative Design offices. This mural was an illustration of a poem titled, “Maker of Dreams.” Other faculty members who saw Hrdy's work were also impressed, and she was commissioned to create a series of 20 panels for the doors separating two dining rooms in the Women's Dormitory. She titled the work, \\"Pageant of Foods.\\" Newspapers in Tulsa and Oklahoma City picked up the story, publishing complimentary articles about her work, her talent, and how she had exchanged her art for tuition and board at the University.

During Hrdy's senior year, noted Tulsa architect, Bruce Goff, attended a luncheon at the Women's Dormitory dining room, where he noticed Hrdy's painted panels. Fascinated, he requested an opportunity to meet the artist. At the meeting, he proposed that Hrdy come to Tulsa to create some murals for his current project, the Riverside Studio. Hrdy agreed to do the studio after her graduation, and moved to Tulsa in the fall of 1928. The two artists' work was complementary. According to Eric Lee, Goff had designed the building as an artistic representation of music, and Hrdy's paintings were an abstract visualization of music. After completing work on the Riverside Studio, Goff invited Hrdy to collaborate on a project he had been awarded to redesign the interior of Tulsa's Brady Theater, (then known as Convention Hall). Hrdy created a long asbestos fire curtain for the stage and a mural for the entrance. According to the biography by Wall, these two works, \\"...solidified Hrdy's understanding of abstraction and her position as a modern artist.\\" =New York= Hrdy decided to expand her exposure to the art world by moving to New York City, where she lived between 1931 and 1933.

He appeared on stage and in silent films and recorded for Columbia Records in the 1910s and 1920s.Alice Calhoun and Browne in Closed Doors (1921, courtesy of Archeophone Records) Biography Browne was born in 1878 in North Adams, Massachusetts. Before his acting career, he served in the Second Massachusetts U.S. Volunteers during the Spanish–American War and had a brief career campaigning for the Democratic Party. In fact, William Jennings Bryan, then the Secretary of State, offered Browne a diplomatic position in February 1914 but the latter declined. Browne later worked for a stock company as an actor, casting him in plays such as Arizona and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm in the early 1900s. A skilled banjo player, Browne performed in vaudeville for seven years before recording a series of songs for Columbia Records, starting in 1916. His first record, perhaps his most well-known, is a re-interpretation of the American folk song \\"Turkey in the Straw\\". Released in March 1916, Browne appropriated the standard as a coon song re-titled \\"Nigger Love a Watermelon Ha! Ha! Ha!\\". It is commonly referred to as one of the most racist songs in American music: the song relied heavily on the watermelon stereotype, a belief popularized in the 19th century that African-Americans had an unusual appetite for watermelons. For the B-side, Browne chose to record the minstrel show favorite \\"Old Dan Tucker\\", marking the tune's first commercial appearance on a major label. Between 1906 and 1925, Browne appeared in at least 14 Broadway shows, including Oh, Lady! Lady!!.\\"Harry Browne\\", Internet Broadway Database, accessed May 23, 2017 His film debut is believed to have been in August 1914 with the release of The Eagle's Mate. During his acting career, Browne had roles in notable films such as The Unwelcome Mrs. Hatch, The Heart of Jennifer, and Closed Doors. Afterwards, he worked as an announcer and production director for CBS radio, a position he resigned from in 1931. Browne died in 1954 at 76.

He was Minister for Police (August 2012 to June 2013 and January 2014 to February 2014), Minister for Petroleum and Energy (February 2014 to January 2016), Minister for Transport and Infrastructure (January 2016 to July 2016) and Minister for Petroleum and Energy (July 2016 until August 2016) in the government of Peter O'Neill. Prior to entering politics, Duban was the president of the student wing of the People's Progress Party, general secretary of the People's National Congress and an executive officer to Prime Minister Peter O'Neill. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the same seat at the 2007 election. Duban was elected to the National Parliament on his second attempt at the 2012 election, and was promoted to Minister for Police in O'Neill's post-election Cabinet reshuffle. As minister, he launched the Police Modernisation Concept, which saw K200 million additional funding to improve police vehicles, infrastructure and other logistics. On 3 June 2013, the National Court declared his 2012 victory null and void after finding that he had engaged in bribery and undue influence during the campaign, ordering a by- election in his seat. The Police Association responded by thanking Duban for his \\"foresight and vision\\" as minister and stating that their membership were \\"very grateful\\". Duban won the by-election in December 2013, returned to parliament, and was reinstated as Minister for Police a month later. Several of his opponents had criticised the government for promising Duban a guaranteed position in Cabinet if he were to be returned, and having Prime Minister O'Neill retain Duban's former police portfolio in an acting capacity until after the by-election. In February 2014, he was promoted to Minister for Petroleum and Energy after the dumping of William Duma. He signed the development license for the Stanley gas condensate project in May. In June 2014, he suggested that Papua New Guinea should pass legislation to regulate social media in the country because \\"opportunists and social media freaks are abusing these freedoms and rights\\". In October 2014, after a prolonged court- ordered recount of the 2013 by-election results, Duban was affirmed as having been duly re-elected. In November 2014, election petitioner Bryan Kramer was arrested on charges of conspiring to kill Duban, though these were dismissed in June 2015. In January 2016, Duban was shifted to the position of Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, but was moved back to Minister for Petroleum and Energy that July. At the 2017 election, Duban lost his seat to Bryan Kramer, who had lodged the court petition that had unseated him back in 2013.

Commissioned in 1936 and largely completed by 1941, it took until 1953 to officially unveil the monument due to delays to the final elements of its construction which resulted from the Second World War. The Memorial was originally located directly in front of the-then Parliament House, but was moved to its current location in 1968. History The memorial was commissioned by the Australian Government in 1936 to commemorate King George V, who had been Australia's head of state from 1910 until his death that year. The Government sought submissions for the design of the monument, and a proposal submitted by sculptor Rayner Hoff and architect Harry Foskett was selected. However, Hoff died in 1937 before work began on the memorial, and John E Moorfield was selected to complete the memorial using Hoff's design. The memorial includes a bronze statue of King George V on one of its faces. A stone statue of Saint George mounted on a horse is also located on the rear face, and commemorates George V's leadership of the British Empire during the First World War. The Museum of Australian Democracy's website states that: Completion of the memorial was delayed by the Second World War. While it was largely complete by 1941, the casting of the statue of George V and bronze plaques to be mounted on the Memorial did not proceed as the models could not be shipped to the United Kingdom where they were to be cast. These elements of the memorial finally arrived in Australia in 1952. The King George V Memorial was officially unveiled on 4 March 1953. The memorial was originally located directly opposite Parliament House, with the statue of George V facing the Parliament and that of Saint George facing the Australian War Memorial. This location had been selected by the Government against the views of Hoff and Foskett, who preferred a site away from the direct axis between the Parliament and the War Memorial. In 1968 the memorial was moved to its current location just off the axis so that the view of the Australian War Memorial from the parliament was no longer obstructed. The Minister of the Interior Doug Anthony, gained Prime Minister Robert Menzies' agreement to begin work on the project after convincing him that the memorial was \\"not ... good statuary\\" and spoiled the view from parliament. Menzies successor as Prime Minister, Harold Holt, publicly spoke in support of moving the memorial in 1967, describing it as an \\"excrescence\\" and joking that he hoped it would be destroyed \\"if we are so unfortunate as to have an enemy attack\\". At the time the memorial was moved it was a popular tourist attraction. It was also often used as a meeting point by Canberrans. The King George V Memorial has been heritage listed since 2004. During 2015 it was restored at a cost of $326,000; these works included installing features to prevent it from being used by skateboarders. At this time, the Canberra Times reported that the memorial was a \\"revered site for the city's skaters and has even featured in promo videos for international pro skate teams as they toured Australia\\". Some Indigenous Australian residents of Canberra called for the memorial to be removed in 2020 on the grounds that it is inappropriate to have a British Empire-era monument adjacent to the Aboriginal Tent Embassy.

Description  Caladenia startiorum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and wide. Up to three pink flowers long and wide are borne on a stalk tall. The sepals and petals have thick pinkish to brown glandular tips. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide and the lateral sepals are the same size, spread apart from each other with their tips turning downwards. The petals are long and wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is long, wide and white or pale to deep pink with narrow red teeth up to long on the sides. The tip of the labellum is curled under and there are four rows of pink calli up to long, along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to October, more prolifically after summer fires.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia startiorum was first formally described in 2001 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown from a specimen collected near the northern edge of the Mount Lindesay National Park and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (startiorum) honours the Start family for their interest in Australian orchids and for discovering this species.  Distribution and habitat  Starts' spider orchid is found between Mount Barker and the Porongurup National Park in the Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions where it grows in moist heath and nearby woodland and in dense shrubby forest.

It took place near Bong Son, and lasted from 1–16 May 1966. Prelude Following operations in the Central Highlands in March and April 1966, the 1st Cavalry Division returned to Bình Định Province in May. Intelligence indicated the presence of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 22nd Regiment, 3rd Division on the Bong Son plain and the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division commanded by Col. Hal Moore was given the mission of engaging it. Operation On the morning of 4 May, 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment (1/7th Cavalry) and the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment (2/7th Cavalry) were landed by helicopter to the north and west of the suspected location of the PAVN 22nd Regiment while the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment established blocking positions to the east along Highway 1. The 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment (1/9th Cavalry) supported by ARVN armor then attacked north. The first day's operation killed 15 PAVN soldiers and several were captured, however the bulk of the PAVN unit (identified later as being the 9th Battalion, 22nd Regiment) avoided the engagement. At 13:50 on 5 May, Troop D, 1/9th Cavalry was engaged by heavy weapons fire from the hamlet of Binh De 2. Col. Moore ordered his units to create a cordon around Binh De 2 which would then be softened up by artillery in preparation for an assault the following day. However, when the assault began the next morning it was clear that the PAVN had left the area. Shortly afterwards, PAVN fire downed a 1/9th Cavalry helicopter near the village of Thanh Son 2, approximately 5 km south of Binh De 2. Col Moore again ordered a cordon to be established around Thanh Son 2 and 1/7th Cavalry attacked the village from the north but was repulsed. Air strikes were called in however many PAVN were able to withdraw at nightfall under the cover of heavy rain. The following morning the cavalry forces entered Thanh Son 2 and captured some stragglers including the 9th Battalion's Political Officer. Also on 7 May the 3rd Brigade was reinforced by the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment. From 7–11 May, the reinforced 3rd Brigade conducted fruitless searches of the Bong Son plain, then on the 11th the 2/7th Cavalry was landed by helicopter into the Kim Son Valley, establishing Firebases Bird and Pony, while the 1/9th Cavalry conducted aerial reconnaissance. Several small engagements took place, but no sizable units were located and Col. Moore terminated the operation on 16 May. Aftermath Total US casualties were 28 killed, while the US claimed that Viet Cong losses were 345 killed and a further 192 estimated killed.

Biography  Faggioni was born in La Spezia in 1909. After graduating from the Nautical Institute of Camogli (Genoa), in August 1928 he began the course as a reserve officer in the Italian Navy, and in October 1929 he graduated as an ensign. He served for some time on torpedo boats and destroyers, and in 1931, after promotion to sub-lieutenant, he became a teacher in the C.R.E.M. (Corpo Regi Equipaggi Marittimi, Corps of Royal Naval Crews) schools. In 1935 he was mobilized due to the needs associated with the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, and was assigned on the destroyer Zeffiro. In 1937 he became lieutenant and was given command of MAS boats; in June 1939, after becoming aide to Prince Eugenio of Savoy, he organized an expedition in the East African lowland, earning a commendation for his organizational capacity.Luigi Faggioni on the Website of the Italian Navy In June 1940, with Italy's entry into World War II, Faggioni became a member of the 1st MAS Flotilla in La Spezia, where he was given command of a special section of MT explosive motorboats. He was later tasked with organizing and training a group of eight (later reduced to six) MTM explosive motorboats that would attack British shipping in Souda Bay, Crete, under his command. The action, known as the Raid on Souda Bay, was carried in the night of 26 March 1941. Carried by the destroyers Francesco Crispi and Quintino Sella till near Souda, the six MTM boats were led by Faggioni inside the bay, where they attacked different objectives. One MTM, operated by Sub-Lieutenant Angelo Cabrini, hit the heavy cruiser HMS York, partially sinking it in shallow water, and another one, operated by Sergeant Emilio Barberi, damaged the 8,324 GRT oil tanker Pericles, that would sink a few days later during the tow towards Alexandria. Faggioni's MTM missed its target and hit a pier, while the other three operators missed or were forced to scuttle their boats following mechanical breakdowns (one of them may have also hit Pericles, in addition to Barberi's one).Giorgio Giorgerini, Attacco dal mare. Storia dei mezzi d'assalto della Marina italiana, pp. 134 to 141.Operazione Suda. Faggioni and his comrades were taken prisoner; all six were awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor for the action in Souda Bay. Faggioni, promoted to lieutenant commander in January 1944 (while still in Allied captivity), was repatriated in January 1945 during Italy's co- belligerence with the Allies and participated in the last stages of the Italian campaign as deputy commander of Mariassalto, the successor of the Tenth MAS Flotilla in Italy's co-belligerent forces. After the war he was given command of 6th Dredging Group and then of the 4th Dredging Group; after promotion to commander, he received command of the 1st Destroyer Squadron. Promoted to captain in 1956, he commanded the Divers and Raiders Center in Varignano, La Spezia and then the 5th Naval Group. In 1960 became a member of the High Council of the Armed Forces, and in January 1963 he was promoted to rear admiral and given command of the La Spezia Naval Base.

Prior Events  On 13 September 1920 the White Fleet ships departed to shell Berdiansk the following day, but found no enemy vessels and then moved to protect a convoy of ships carrying grain. The detachment included two gunboats (Ural and Salgyr) two armed icebreaker (Gaydamak and Djigit), one patrol boat, one unarmed minesweeper and received the support from torpedo boat Zorkyi (carrying no torpedo tubes). After receiving news of the naval bombardment against Berdiansk, the Reds dispatched from Mariupol the following ships: gunboats Budyonny, Krasnaya Zvezda, Svoboda and Znamya Sotsializma, supported by three patrol boats. The two forces were equal in number of ships with Whites having an advantage in artillery fire and speed (The Reds gunboats could not sail more than 5 knots).http://militera.lib.ru/h/whitefleet/11.html  Battle  At dawn of 15 September, the two flotilla engaged: Reds fired first, opening fire from 60 cables of distance. The shelling brought no damage and Reds suffered difficulties. During the first phase of battle, only Ural and Salgyr opened fire against the Reds. The ships maneuvered and exchanged sporadic fire, until around midday the battle reached a peak. With 40 cables of distance, White gunboat Gaydamak scored one hit on the Red gunboat Znamya Sotsializma: the boiler's power pipes suffered damage and ship lost course being wrapped in its own steam. Krasnaya Zvezda took in tow the damaged unit and returned fire scoring two hits on gunboat Salgyr on the waterline causing her quick sinking: Salgyr was quickly lost with 2 crewmembers. Gunboat Ural took damage while saving the sailors of Salgyr. The battle lasted until the Whites consumed their ammunition. Reds gunboats kept on firing against the retreating White units until 13:30. Receiving news about the battle, Whites dispatched destroyer Bespokoynny and gunboat Strazh as reinforcement, but they did not reached the battle in time and Bespokoynny suffered damage after blowing up a mine (according another version the ship just delayed).http://www.proza.ru/2010/02/10/1213  Results  The White flotilla lost one ship (Salgyr) while a second one was damaged (Ural) and was forced to retreat, pursued by the enemy. Nevertheless, both sides claimed victory. According to the Whites although the fight was indecisive, they claimed an \\"unquestionable\\" victory having protected transports loaded with grain. In addition, they claimed that Reds ships did not operated again in the Sea of Azov.

The work was titled Tamil Wisdom. Facilitating the evangelical works of the missionaries like Constanzo Beschi, Ziegenbalg, and Percival, Robinson published an enlarged version of the work under the title Tales and Poems of South India in 1885. In the preface of his second work, he acknowledged the earlier translations by F. W. Ellis, W. H. Drew, Karl Graul and Charles E. Gover. Robinson, like other earlier missionaries, translated only the first (Aram) and second books (Porul) of the Kural text, translating 108 chapters in verse. He did not translate the third book (Inbam). His English contemporaries greatly praised his verse translation, although native scholars of later years, such as T. P. Meenakshisundaram, had some reservations about its fidelity to the original.

The Tonga-Kermadec Ridge is an oceanic ridge in the south-west Pacific Ocean underlying the Tonga-Kermadec island arc. It is the most linear, fastest converging, and most seismically active subduction boundary on Earth, and consequently has the highest density of submarine volcanoes. The Tonga-Kermadec Ridge stretches more than north- northeast from New Zealand's North Island. The Pacific Plate subducts westward beneath the Australian Plate along the ridge. It is divided into two segments, the northern Tonga Ridge and southern Kermadec Ridge, by the Louisville Seamount Chain. On its western side, the ridge is flanked by two back-arc basins, the Lau Basin and Havre Trough, that began opening at 6 and 2 Ma respectively. Together with these younger basins the ridge forms the eastward- migrating, 100 Ma-old Lau-Tonga-Havre-Kermadec arc/back-arc system or complex. The extension in the Lau-Havre basin results in a higher rate of subduction than convergence along the Australian-Pacific plate boundary. The rates of extension, subduction, and convergence all increase northwards in this complex, subduction at a rate of and extension at a rate of . As a result, the Tonga-Kermadec Ridge moves independently of both tectonic plates and forms the Tonga-Kermadec Plate, in its turn fragmented into the Niuafo'ou, Tonga, and Kermadec microplates. The Samoa and Louisville mantle plumes both contribute to the lavas of two of the northern Tonga islands, Tafahi and Niuatoputapu; ocean island basalt (OIB) from the Samoa plume were introduced from 3-4 Ma when subduction in the Vitiaz Trench (north-west of Tonga) ceased. The lavas of the Louisville Seamount Chain were generated 80-90 Ma but began to subduct under the Tonga-Kermadec Ridge at 8 Ma. The Hikurangi and Manihiki plateaux, north and south of the Tonga-Kermadec Ridge respectively, form part of the Ontong Java-Hikurangi-Manihiki large igneous province (LIP), the largest volcanic event on Earth during the past 200 million years. The Osbourn Trough, located just north of the Tonga-Kermadec and Louisville intersection, is the palaeo-spreading centre between the Hikurangi and Manihiki plateaux away from which the age of the Pacific Plate increases from 85 Ma to 144 Ma. The subduction of the Hikurangi Plateau beneath New Zealand and the southern part of the Kermadec Arc has resulted in large volumes of lava and a high density of volcanoes in the arc. The initial Hikurangi-Kermadec collision, however, occurred to the north where a missing piece of the Ontong Java-Hikurangi- Manihiki LIP has already been subducted.

Its main tasks are: support and servicing of export transactions, issuing governmental guarantees, and support of housing. Founded in 1924 under an initiative of Minister of Treasury Władysław Grabski, its first president was a former Minister of Treasury, Jan Kanty Steczkowski. The bank was involved in Polish international trade, funding of numerous companies and of Polish Central Industrial Region. After the World War II its activity was gradually phased-out, reactivated starting in 1989.  Headquarters  The bank's monumental modernistic headquarters was designed by Rudolf Świerczyński. Constructed in 1928–1931, it was recognized as a monument in 1965.  History  = Second Polish Republic = The history of BGK dates back to 1924 when the President of the Republic of Poland, at the initiative of then Prime Minister and Treasury Minister Wladyslaw Grabski, issued a decree establishing BGK. It was created by a merger of three public banks from the Galicia region, the Polish National Bank, the State Reconstruction Bank and the Credit Institution of Malopolska Cities.Władysław Grabski The creation of BGK was a result of Grabski's economic concepts. Despite being opposed to statism in industry and trade, Grabski was at the same time a supporter of strong state banking. The Bank's main tasks included granting long-term loans through issuance of covered, municipal, railway and bank bonds and offering local government loans as well as providing loans to savings institutions and performing all other banking tasks. The Bank had special obligations towards state-owned and local government companies. Securities issued by BGK were guaranteed by the State Treasury. Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, in accordance with its statutory tasks, from the beginning of its existence financially supported the development of Polish economy. BGK was financially involved in all major investments of the Second Polish Republic. Among them is e.g. the seaport and shipyard in Gdynia. One of the forms of BGK's activity in this field were activities undertaken by BGK at the request of the government, aimed at financial protection and modernization of strategic enterprises of the economic and military interests of the state. This became the basis for the creation of the so-called BGK conglomerate, which included enterprises of great importance for the national economy and defense of the country: the Association of Starachowice Mining and Smelting Plants, Grodzisk Chemical Plant, Boruta Chemical Industry, The Association of Potassium Salt Mining and a number of other plants. Starting from 1936, BGK was included in realization of state investment plan of creating the Central Industrial Region. The Bank also administered the government's special purpose funds, including the Credit Institution Support Fund, State Construction Fund, State Credit Fund and Labour Fund. At the turn of the 1920s and 1930s, BGK became one of the biggest banks of inter-war Poland and served as the primary participant in the economic restructuring process. Between 1928 and 1931, a BGK building designed by Rudolf Swierczynski was constructed in Warsaw's Aleje Jerozolimskie street. = Post-war development = After World War II, BGK was reactivated with renowned economist Professor Edward Lipski at its helm. In 1948, as a result of a banking reform, BGK was supposed to be an investment bank. Its role during 1948-1989 period was mainly limited to pre-war foreign debt service. Former BGK logo In 1989, BGK resumed it operation as a state-owned bank and as such acted primarily as issue agent for Treasury bonds, offered for the first time in several decades. The Bank's activities focused on the preparation of sub-agent deals for the sale and redemption of bonds, development of accounting and reporting rules and organizing a nationwide sales network. In December 1997, BGK returned to its pre-war headquarters in Aleje Jerozolimskie in Warsaw. In modern Poland, the government tasks the Bank with the operation of a number of special purpose funds and programmes (including the National Road Fund, National Housing Fund, Thermomodernisation and Renovation Fund and the Railway Fund). BGK participates in the implementation of the state's economic objectives. During the economic slowdown, it provides funding for infrastructure investments and thus supports growth of this sector of the economy. It is an important link in the provision of funding and support for areas that are important for the society, such as housing infrastructure, energy efficiency and public utilities. It supports Polish exporters by taking on part of the risk related to trading activities of Polish companies. In collaboration with other financial institutions, BGK improves access to funding for businesses, which translates into lower unemployment and stronger GDP growth. BGK manages several special purpose funds and a number of governmental programmes. Its mission is to support social and economic growth of Poland and the public finance sector in the performance of its tasks.  Three Seas Initiative Investment Fund  The twelve members of the Three Seas Initiative met for their first summit in 2016, in Dubrovnik. It is composed of Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. In 2019, Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego and Export–Import Bank of Romania established the Three Seas Initiative Investment Fund. It is focusing on projects creating transport, energy and digital infrastructure in the Three Seas region. The aim is to raise up to EUR 3-5 billion. The Fund will engage, on a commercial basis, in infrastructure projects with a total value of up to EUR 100 billion, while the needs of the Three Seas region have been estimated at over EUR 570 billion.

It is about a girl, Leanna, who lives in 22nd century America where human clones and cyborgs are treated like second-class citizens, and what happens when she discovers that her parents are activists and that she is a clone. Reception Booklist, in its review of The Clone Codes, wrote \\"The McKissacks' slight story for younger readers packs a great deal of messaging, which will no doubt prove useful in classroom discussions of issues and themes but sometimes comes at the expense of the story. The science-fiction backdrop serves as a framework for issues of identity and societal prejudice but is not predominant in the reading experience.\\" School Library Journal's review was more critical, calling it \\"A clunky, didactic science-fiction allegory.\\" and wrote \\"Some aspects of the plot are predictable and poorly drawn .. too many references to the distant past .. prevent the futuristic setting from coming to life.\\" Nevertheless, it did conclude \\"Still, the fast pace, short chapters, and slim page count will make this volume attractive to reluctant readers, and the obvious curriculum tie-ins will appeal to teachers.\\" The Clone Codes has also been reviewed by The Horn Book Magazine, Library Media Connection, Voice of Youth Advocates, Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, and Multicultural Review.

It was established in 1900 and inaugurated in 1905, when Haguenau was a German town and part of Alsace-Lorraine. In spite of its name, it is as much an art museum as a museum dedicated to History. The museum was founded by the mayor, Xavier Nessel, who was also a keen amateur archaeologist. The building was initially designed to house the municipal collections, the municipal archive and the municipal library. It was built by the architects Joseph Müller (1863–??) and (1852–1912) who also designed the Strassburger Sängerhaus. Apart from artefacts relating to the history of the town, including its Jewish community, the museum owns a rich collection of archaeological finds from the Neolithic, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age and the Gallo-Roman period. It also displays a number of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque artworks from religious and secular buildings from the town and its surroundings; in many cases, those buildings themselves (such as Frederick Barbarossa's castle in Haguenau) have long disappeared. The museum also owns a collection of Strasbourg faience by the Hannong Family and a collection of modern art, including Art Nouveau glassware, and paintings. The ethnographic and folk art collections relating to Alsace were moved to the Musée alsacien nearby in 1972.

History Kings Square was built in between 1927 and 1929. This involved the demolition of shops and houses in the area, which also affected St Aldate Street, New Lane and Kings Street where the north end of the street was demolished. At this time the Oxbode was also built. Due to the building of the Oxbode and Kings Square the west part of Gloucester started to deteriorate as the city was expanded southwards and eastwards. Originally Kings Square included the main bus station for Gloucester and a car park. It remained like this until the 1960s. In the early 1960s an extension of the Bon Marché department store, originally owned by Drapery Trust and is now Debenhams, filled part of the west side of the square. Showrooms for the Midlands Electricity store were built on the east side. Part of the bus station in Kings Square in 1962 Kings Square (1976) In 1969 and 1974, during a large redevelopment of central Gloucester, the square was redesigned and new shops were built on the east and south sides. Water fountains with stepping stones and paddling areas were created in the centre of the square. Also at this time Kings Street was covered to become an indoor shopping centre called Kings Walk Shopping Centre. The north side of the square was redeveloped in 1984. In 2006, The square was levelled and concreted, as the water fountains had fallen into disrepair. On 20 January 2014, The Golden Egg building, previously a restaurant built in the 1960s, was demolished. At the same time, other minor improvements were also made including repainting and the addition of new benches. The square is now mainly used for markets./ The square is part of the Kings Quarter redevelopment project, however the plans are for Kings Square to remain as a public open space. Gloucester Post Office Gloucester Post Office (2017) The central post office for Gloucester was opened in 1934 in Kings Square. It was the city's first purpose built head post office. The building was designed by Henry E. Seccombe of H.M. Office of Works, London. The building is three storeys high, made mainly of brick and stone with concrete floors and beams, the front is faced with Portland stone, the roof is made of slate and asphalt. Two English oak doors are at the entrance of the building. It replaced the head post office in George Street by Gloucester railway station and the existing post office on the corner of Westgate Street and St Johns Lane. The Regal Front of The Regal Construction work started, at the north side of Kings Square, in 1939 paid for by the Associated British Cinemas. However, due to World War II, the construction was halted until 1955. The Regal Cinema was finally opened on 19 March 1956. It had single auditorium that was used for films, live theatre and music. It was renamed ABC Regal in 1963 and then it was taken over by EMI in February 1974. On 6 April 1974 it was closed to be converted to a triple screen cinema with 1,468 seats, and reopened on 22 July 1974. It was taken over by the Cannon Group in 1986 and renamed Cannon. It closed down on 12 December 1990. Local amateur dramatic groups like the Gods often performed there. Cliff Richard, Cilla Black, Adam Faith and Roy Orbison made appearances there from the late 1950s and The Beatles appeared there in March 1963. Morecambe and Wise appeared there in 1971 with total of 6,000 people attended their four performances. The building was taken over by J D Wetherspoons and converted into a pub. It opened on 3 April 1996 and is called The Regal.

Located at the King Shaka International Airport, it is situated 30 minutes from Durban Harbour and 90 minutes from the Richards Bay Harbour, and has an international airport, a cargo terminal, warehousing, offices and an agricultural zone. History The Dube TradePort Corporation is named after John Langalibalele Dube, who was an educator, clergyman, writer, newspaper editor and the founding president of the then South African Native National Congress, later the ANC. In 2002, the South African government decided to invest in new international airport outside Durban. The following year saw the creation of the Dube TradePort Company by the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government to develop a world-class aviation export facility. 2005 saw the beginnings of a development master plan for the Dube TradePort at the proposed airport. In 2007, the iLembe Consortium were appointed to construct Dube TradePort and the King Shaka International Airport. In 2010, the Dube Cargo Terminal and King Shaka International Airport opened on schedule with the Dube TradeHouse opening later in the year. The air-bridge from the cargo terminal opened in 2011 with the first produce at the AgriZone harvested and the Corporation moved into its new headquarters onsite. Governance The Dube TradePort Corporation is managed by the Board Chairperson Dr Zanele Bridgette Gasa and its daily operations are managed by Chief Executive Officer Hamish Erskine. Erskine had been in the acting role from February 2015 and was officially appointed as CEO in September 2016. The previous CEO, Saxen van Coller, had been fired in June 2015 when she failed to disclose previous criminal offences. Organisation The Dube TradePort Corporation's business is divided amongst a number of entities: * King Shaka International Airport * Dube Cargo Terminal * Dube Tradezone 1 And 2 * Dube City * Dube Agrizone * Dube Iconnect =King Shaka International Airport= =Dube Cargo Terminal= The cargo terminal currently has a capacity to handle 100,000 tons of cargo a year and can in the future has the capacity to increase to two million tons.

The cargo terminal connects Dube Trade Zones via overhead conveyor air-bridge allowing freight-forwarding community, logistics service providers, assemblers, distributors and manufacturers to based in that zone. The facility also boasts 1 500 m2 of open cold storage area and specialised temperature controlled storage. The cargo terminal has five main operators, Emirates Sky Cargo, SAA Cargo, Bid Air Cargo, SA Airlink and Africa Charter Airline.

It was unique in the period for having black owners and an almost entirely black staff. The newspaper came out on a weekly basis. It was an initiative of the SA Catholic Bishops Conference and activist- journalist Zwelakhe Sisulu who was the founding editor.Thloloe, Joe (7 October 2012). \\"Zwelakhe Sisulu: leader black media could trust, 1950 – 2012\\".

As editor of the weekly newspaper, Sisulu championed the rights of black workers, incurring the hostility of the state. In 1986 Sisulu was arrested twice, the second arrest led to his imprisonment for two years in solitary confinement,https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/other/statement-by- zwelakhe-sisulu-on-the-occasion-of-the-20th-anniversary-of-the-.pdf and the newspaper was banned in 1988. In addition to state repression, the newspaper also had to struggle with financial challenges. Never able to obtain enough advertising to become profitable, New Nation relied on the donations of its supporters. The paper aligned itself with the trade unions as well as the Winnie Mandela grouping within the ANC. The New Nation only escaped debt in 1995 when it was taken over by Nthato Motlana.

It was approved by the Thai National Assembly in July 1997 and entered into application on 8 December 1997.  Background  The constitutions of 1991 and 1997 had already recognised the right to information. The Official Information Act was passed at the same time as the 1997 Constitution, and was designed to formally define the conditions of access to information. The Act was the culmination of a period of political reform which started in 1992 with the popular protest in Bangkok against the government of General Suchinda Kraprayoon, and was precipitated by Thailand’s economic crisis in 1997.Blanton, Thomas. \\"The World’s Right to Know.\\" Foreign Policy, 11 Nov. 2009. At the beginning of the latter, the government perpetuated the tradition of non-disclosure towards the public. When the gravity of the crisis became evident, its lack of credibility, especially after the seriousness of the crisis became apparent, an IMF intervention was welcomed since it was considered as a way to guarantee to the Thai public relevant information on the scope of the crisis and on official actions to limit its consequences.Grigorescu, A. (2003), International Organizations and Government Transparency: Linking the International and Domestic Realms. International Studies Quarterly, 47: 643–667. This chain of events led to the adoption of an official Act in 1997. According to Alexandru Grigorescu, the act was less the result of IMF demands for transparency than a signal by the Thai government that future information it offered would be verifiable. Thailand was the first country in South East Asia to implement a FOI law.  Legal content and functioning  The Official Information Act guarantees people’s rights regarding official information (defined under section 4 as “information in possession or control of a State agency, whether it is the information relating to the operation of the State or the information relating to a private individual”\\"Official Information Act, B.E. 2540 (1997).\\" Thailawonline.), including the right to get advice (section 7), to inspect, to request a copy (section 9), and to ask the state to correct or change personal information (section 25). The law functions essentially through three mechanisms : * state agencies (defined under section 4 as “central administration, provincial administration, local administration, State enterprise, Government agency attached to the National Assembly, Court only in respect of the affairs unassociated with the trial and adjudication of cases”) are to publish a list of official information in an official “Government Gazette” (section 7) * they are also to make available a list of official information for public inspection (section 9) * finally, they are to provide any official information other than that already published in the Gazette or made available for public inspection upon individual request (section 11) The act established the Official Information Board (OIB), the leader of which is to be appointed by the Prime Minister, and which is responsible for the implementation of the act. = Exemptions = A global principle states that state agencies are not to release information unless they are convinced that the request is necessary for the protection of the rights and liberties of an individual person or is beneficial to the public (section 11\\"The Right to Information in Thailand.\\", Country reports, Article 19, 15 Oct. 2015.). One absolute exemption exists: official information which could harm the interests of the Thai monarchy can never be disclosed (section 14). Other exemptions exist, although they are not absolute, and thus may or may not be a motive for the prohibition of the disclosure of official information. They are listed under section 15 and include information which may jeopardize the national security or international relations, information which may endanger the life or safety of a person, and medical reports. A Royal Decree can at any time add an element to the list of exemptions. = Appeals = If the disclosure of official information is refused, the requester can, invoking section 18, either file a complaint at the OIB, or appeal through the OIB to the Information Disclosure Tribunal, which is composed of non-civil servants, and they have a total of 15 days to do so after they have received an order prohibiting the disclosure. An appeal to this tribunal is final (except when a further appeal is submitted to the administrative court).  The Official Information Act in practice  A case involving Kasetsart University Demonstration School is often cited as a reference, and one of the first successful cases putting the Official Information Act in practice. In 1998, Sumalee Limpa-ovart requested to see the examination sheets and marks of the entrance test, after her daughter failed the test. Her request was rejected, and she filed a complaint at the OIB, which failed. She then appealed to the Information Disclosure Tribunal, which concluded that all the exam papers and marks were to be considered as official information. After having accessed the sheets, she realized that candidates with lower marks than her daughter had been admitted because of family connections.Lintner, Bertil, Sheila S. Coronel and Chongkittavorn, Kavi. The Right to Know: Access to Information in Southeast Asia. Quezon City, Philippines: Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, 2001. Consequently, Thailand's Ministry of University Affairs ordered a massive reform of admission procedures in the country. According to Andrew Harding and Peter Leyland, the case contributed greatly to the education system of the country.Harding, Andrew and Leyland, Peter. The Constitutional System of Thailand: A Contextual Analysis; Historical Analysis and Contemporary Issues in Thai Constitutionalism (2011), SOAS School of Law Legal Studies Research Paper Series No. 07/2011 Less successful applications were made to gain access to an official report on the popular protests of 1992 by newspapers and families whose relatives were killed during the events. After months of no response, the Ministry of Defence eventually released a report from 1992. However, it was, according to many of the victims' families, a “whitewash of events”,Streckfuss, David. Truth on Trial in Thailand: Defamation, Treason, and LeÌse-majesté. Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge, 2011. and the requesters were threatened of prosecution should the information be disseminated more widely.\\"FOI International Focus : Thailand.\\" Thailand. Ucl.ac.uk, 30 Sept. 2011.  Effects  Two years after its implementation, in the concluding remarks of his report on the act, Nakorn Serirak argued that it was “a crucial component of democratic development as it encourages people to enjoy more political participation by directly expressing their opinions and proposing their needs or suggestions to the state”.Serirak, Nakorn. \\"Thailand's Information Law.\\" Freedom of Information Review. 2000. More than half a million Thais utilized the Official Information Act in its first three years.

Critiques and demand for refinement  Despite a relatively high number of requests, a lack of public awareness of the act is often deplored (and the fact that a majority of these requests are made by citizens, not by journalists). A forum entitled “14 years of Thailand’s Official Information Act: Time for a Change” was organized in 2011 by the Southeast Asian Press Alliance (SEAPA). Thienchai Na Nakorn, Thailand’s Information Commissioner, acknowledged the existence of a culture of fear in the civil service that discouraged officials from providing information to the public, and that a reform of the act was necessary.\\"Freedom of Information Law in Need of Reforms.\\" SEAPA Southeast Asian Press Alliance, 21 Dec. 2011. Another issue often raised regards time periods. When it has received a request, a State agency must reply “within a reasonable period of time” (section 11). This period of time is not defined precisely in the act, however Article 19’s report on the state of Thailand’s FOI law indicates that the term has been “interpreted rather liberally by State officials”. Their research has found that delays of months followed by a refusal to release without an explanation are not uncommon.Article 19, Freedom of Expression and the Media: Thailand, December 2005, pp.106-115 Thai journalist Kavi Chongkittavorn has published an article in The Nation (although it is not available on the newspaper's website anymore) also asking for a reform of the act, describing it as a “tale of disappointment, betrayal and procrastination”.Chongkittavorn, Kavi. \\"Thais Let down by Free-info Reform.\\" Uppercaise. 30 Nov. 2010. He criticizes the fact that the OIB is, under section 27, under the control of the Prime Minister’s Office – and thus, part of the bureaucracy – rather than being an independent body like the Tribunal. In fact, the Board or its members do not have any specific duty to act independently.Greenleaf, G. W. Asian Data Privacy Laws: Trade and Human Rights Perspectives. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2014. Chongkittavorn also deplores the coordinated adaptation of state agencies to the implementation of the act : > “After some of the big fish were caught red-handed in the first three years, > all government agencies were up in arms against the OIA in order to shield > them from further disclosure and possibly prosecution. Understanding was > reached among them that information disclosure would be at a snail’s pace to > dissuade the public from using the OIA. Apparently, this strategy has been > working unchallenged.”  References  Freedom of information Thai legislation ","title":"Official Information Act 1997"},{"id":"53531676","text":"Balapokuna Raja Maha Vihara () is a historic Buddhist temple situated in Pamankada, Western Province, Sri Lanka.

Description Herklotsichthys punctatus is a small silvery fish which shows a moderate degree of compression on the body which is said to resemble juveniles of Sardinella spp. The belly has a sharp keel of scutes. The posterior margin of the gill slit has two distinct fleshy outgrowths; there are few gill raker with 29–39 on the lower part of the first arch. There are 3–6 streaks on the top of the head and prominent rows of teeth on the roof of the mouth. There are 8 rays on the pelvic fin, while the dorsal fin has 13–21 soft rays and the anal fin has 12–23 soft rays. The back is blueish-green with numerous small black spots, the flanks have a golden or orange mid=lateral line, the underside is silvery. It grows to 8.5 cm, but is more usually 5–7 cm in length. Distribution Herklotsichthys punctatus is distributed in the western Indian Ocean: Red Sea and possibly the Gulf of Aden but this species and other species of Herklotsichthys have been confused, especially Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus. It was first recorded in the Mediterranean in 1974 in the Bardawil Lagoon near Port Said and is now common in the Levantine Sea, the eastern basin of the Mediterranean, and reached Libyan waters by the mid 2000s. Biology Herklotsichthys punctatus is a pelagic and neritic species which van be found from the surface to 20m in depth. It is a sociable species which forms schools in coastal waters H. punctatus feeds almost entirely on zooplankton which it forages for in the upper layers of the water column. Copepods are the main prey followed by euphausiid and megalopa with the remainder of the diet being made up of the larvae of Penaeus prawns, mysids, Lucifer prawns, pelagic gastropods and fish. Feeding was most intense during the south-west monsoon from June to September and during the early hours of the day rather than during the afternoon hours. Smaller fish to 90 mm feed mainly on smaller organisms such as copepods. Larger fish prey on larger organisms such as fish and pelagic gastropods. Mature fish show an intense feeding activity in the months of April and August–September which immediately precede the spawning seasons of this fish. Human use Herklotsichthys punctatus is of minor commercial importance fisheries, fished for using trawls and seines in the Mediterranean but with low price reliability the marketing opportunities are limited. It may be marketed as fresh fish, or it is preserved by drying and dry salting or it is made into fish balls. Naming Herklotsichthys punctatus was described by the German zoologist Eduard Rüppell in 1837. The generic name Herklotsichthys was coined by the Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley in 1951 and honours the Dutch zoologist Jan Adrianus Herklots, while the specific name punctata refers to the spots.

The partition lines, drawn on a map by the British lawyer Cyril Radcliffe, divided the states of Punjab into West Punjab and East Punjab on the basis of religion. As a result, millions of people found themselves on the wrong side of the border overnight. According to various estimates, more than 800,000 Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs were killed in the riots that followed the partition between August 1947 to January 1948. Additionally, more than 1,400,000 people became refugees.

The Watkins stories combine supernatural and mystery elements, leading them to be classified variously as horror and crime fiction (though Rickman personally rejects the label of horror writer). The novella in its original form was published as a short story in the OxCrimes collection, which gathered 27 short crime stories, part of a series of differently themed books in support of Oxfam, the African aid charity. The story was then extended to one more than five times as long, after readers expressed an interest in reading the rest of the story.

Background The 1870 Elementary Education Act had created local school boards to be responsible for the provision of elementary education. Some school boards also established classes for higher classes. These \\"higher tops\\" and even separate schools were provided for older pupils who showed ability and commitment, even new type of evening school for adults. This competition angered churches who were lobbying for public money for the church schools, and some older grammar schools who were also having problems with finance. It was seen by leading conservatives as unacceptable extension to local government, and unacceptable use of the rates. The test case In 1899, Sir John Gorst's private secretary Sir Robert Morant (1863–1920) engineered a test case in which a School of Art in London complained of competition from evening classes run by the London School Board. The District Auditor – Cockerton – ruled that the London School Board could not use the rates to fund higher-grade classes in science and art. The London School Board unsuccessfully appealed twice. A new education act was needed. Implications The Cockerton Judgement halted advanced, or secondary, teaching fostered by the more radical and enterprising School Boards. It prevented school boards from funding anything but elementary schools. As an interim measure, the Board of Education established, by Minute dated 6 April 1900, a new system of \\"Higher elementary schools\\". The subsequent Education Act 1902 (Balfour Act), which Morant drafted, created all-embracing local education authorities which had a wider remit and powers to provide public monies to the church schools. Morant became Permanent Secretary of the Board of Education in April 1903.

Winner that year was Carroll Shelby with co-driver Roy Salvadori in the Aston Martin DBR1/300 but the two Peters finished a respectable 8th overall, 1st in the 1500 cc GT class, 2nd in the newly instigated Index of Thermal Efficiency and 5th in the Index of Performance. In 1960 Lumsden began his partnership with co-driver Peter Sargent at the Nurburgring 1000 Ks, finishing second in the 1300 cc GT class to the Team Elite entry for Alan Stacey and John Wagstaff. Driving solo, Peter Lumsden then won the 1300 CC GT class of the 1960 RAC Tourist Trophy at Goodwood, finishing ninth overall behind various Ferraris and Aston Martins plus Graham Hill's Porsche Carrera Abarth and 5.2 seconds ahead of Graham Warner's famous Elite LOV 1 after three hours of racing. In Lumsden & Riley's final season in the Elite in 1961 they again produced a 1300 cc GT class win in the Nurburgring 1000 km. In the TT later that year, Lumsden driving solo had to settle for second in class to Les Leston's Elite DAD 10, whilst finishing eighth overall. In 1961 Lumsden and his now permanent co-driver Peter Sargent were able to acquire one of the earliest (898 BYR) E-Types off the production line at Jaguar. This was a measure of Lumsden & Sargent's standing as drivers as these cars were provided exclusively to influential motor sport teams and drivers as a result of supply problems at the Jaguar factory. In late September 1961 a fifth place in the Molyslip Trophy at Snetterton behind Mike Parkes (Ferrari 250GT Berlinetta), Roy Salvadori (E-type) and Innes Ireland (Aston Martin DB4GT), and ahead of all the other E-types, was an encouraging debut while the high point of the following year was Le Mans where the two Peters finished fifth overall, and second in the 4-litre GT class behind the Roy Salvadori/Briggs Cunningham E-type. With little more than an hour of the race remaining, 898 BYR was several laps ahead of the Cunningham car when the gearbox became stuck in fourth gear and they could only tour round to the finish.British Racing Drivers' ClubJaguar E-Type The Jaguar E-Type lightweight '49 FXN' In 1963 Lumsden & Sargent acquired a Jaguar Lightweight E-Type (vehicle number 49 FXN), one of only 12 built at the time. On its debut in the 1963 Nurburgring 1000 km, Lumsden crashed 49 FXN badly and was fortunate to escape with his life. The car was returned to the Jaguar factory to be rebuilt and subsequently underwent extensive aerodynamic revision under Dr Samir Klat of Imperial College. On returning to competition in 1964, the car was timed at 168 mph on the Mulsanne straight during the Le Mans test weekend but failed to complete the race itself due to gearbox failure. Lumsden's best result of his few races in the car that year was eighth overall, fifth in class, in the Goodwood TT. Peter Sargent retired from racing at the end of that year but Peter Lumsden retained the car for one more season, winning a couple of victories in club races at Brands Hatch but no longer competitive against the new generation of Cobras and Ferrari 250GT0s. For his last visit to the Nurburgring, Lumsden shared Peter Sutcliffe's Ferrari 250GTO to win the 3-litre GT class. At the end of the 1965 season Peter Lumsden joined Peter Sargent in racing retirement and 49 FXN was sold and in due course became one of the most sought after low drag light weight E-type of all time, known as 49 FXN or the Lumsden/Sargent car.Jaguar Lightweight E-type: The autobiography of 49 FXN.

Noble immigrated with his family to the United States from England. The family owned a weaponry foundry in Georgia during the American Civil War, supplying armaments to the Confederate States Army. Their foundry was subsequently destroyed by the U.S. Army in 1864. At the war's end, they began rebuilding their business in Georgia, and purchased land in Calhoun County, Alabama as an expansion. They went into partnership with former Union general Daniel Tyler and formed the Woodstock Iron Company, originally naming the budding community Woodstock. It was renamed Anniston, after Tyler's daughter-in-law, to avoid confusion over another Woodstock located between Bibb and Tuscaloosa counties. Noble and Tyler personally designed the layout of their town that housed only company employees. The Woodstock Company constructed the buildings and installed the infrastructure. Several years after Noble's 1888 death, $5,400 was raised for a memorial, and Anniston accepted a design of a granite and white marble statue from Durham and Company in Charlotte, North Carolina. The actual sculpting was done by unknown persons in Italy under contract to Morris Brothers in Memphis, Tennessee. The public unveiling of the statue by Noble's granddaughter Elizabeth Roberts, was preceded by a parade through Anniston. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 as an example of sculpture used to commemorate historical events or persons. Although the Encyclopedia of Alabama credits all concerned in the establishment and development of Anniston, the townspeople who commissioned the statue and the National Park Service give recognition only to Noble as the actual founder.

Of volcanic origin and Mesozoic in age, it is located on the oldest part of the Pacific Plate and rises up to (Darwin Rise) above the surrounding ocean floor and is covered with several layers of thick sedimentary sequences that differ from those of other plateaux in the North Pacific. About 50 seamounts are distributed over the MPM. Some of the highest points in the range are above sea level which include Wake Island and Marcus Island. The ocean floor of the MPM dates back to the Jurassic-Cretaceous, some of the oldest oceanic crust on Earth. The MPM is a range of guyots with a lava composition similar to those found in Iceland and the Galapagos Islands, and they probably formed similarly at or near a rift system. In the Cretaceous, they formed large tropical islands located closer to the Equator that began to sink in the late Mesozoic. The MPM formed in the Early Cretaceous (at 110 Ma) over a hotspot that uplifted the ocean floor of the still young Pacific Plate. Reefs developed on the subsiding islands and renewed volcanism in the Late Cretaceous helped maintain some of eastern islands but inevitably the guyots sank to their present depth. It has been proposed that the MPM has crossed over several hotspots, and the MPM guyots are indeed older on the western MPM than the eastern part, but the guyots do not form chains that can be traced to any known hotspots. The MPM, nevertheless, must have originated over the South Pacific Superswell. Among the guyots in the Mid-Pacific Mountains are Allison Guyot, Horizon Guyot, Resolution Guyot and Darwin Guyot. The western half of the Easter hotspot chain, a lineament that includes the Line Islands and Tuamotu archipelago, begins near the eastern part of the MPM. The formation of the MPM thus probably occurred at the Pacific-Farallon Ridge and the Easter hotspot, or where the Easter Microplate is now located.

He was sentenced to death after he wrote an article critical of Islam and the caste system in Mauritania, after which he became a designated prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. He now lives in exile in France due to concerns for his safety. Mkhaitir was born into the Moulamines caste, commonly referred to as the blacksmith caste, which holds the second lowest social status in Mauritania. Before he was arrested on charges of apostasy he worked for SAMMA, a company partially owned by Kinross.  Arrest and death sentence  Mkhaitir was arrested in his home in the city of Nouadhibou on 2 January 2014, two days after publishing an article titled “Religion, Religiosity and Craftsmen” on the website Aqlame. The article was critical of incidents from the prophet Muhammad's life being used to justify slavery of people descended from craftsmen by the upperclass of Mauritania (relating to the caste system in Mauritania). Clerics issued a fatwa against him and demanded he be executed, and a businessman offered reward of 10,000 ouguiya for his death. He was charged with apostasy under Article 306 of the Mauritanian criminal code, and subsequently sentenced to death by firing squad. If the sentence were to be carried out Mkhaitir would be the first person executed in Mauritania since 1987. Despite repenting and saying shahada, the supreme court upheld his death sentence. On 1 April 2016 the case was heard by the court of appeals. The verdict was upheld but sent the case to Mauritania's Supreme Court. In December 2016, Mkhaitir's parents fled the country and appealed for asylum in France, unable to bear constant death threats any longer. On 31 January 2017, the Supreme Court heard the case and returned it to the Court of Appeals. When the appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, protesters, some of them armed, gathered in Nouakchott demanding his execution. Addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council as a representative of the International Humanist and Ethical Union, Kacem El Ghazzali highlighted the case of Mkhaitir, to which the Mauritanian ambassador to the UNHRC claimed Mkhaitir was arrested for his own safety. The diplomat also reportedly insisted \\"there is no need to talk about the death penalty\\"https://www.facebook.com/KacemOfficialPage/videos/644535792249334/?permPage=1 On 3 November 2017, police in the capital Nouakchott dispersed a demonstration and arrested four people for inciting to kill Mkhaitir. A week later, the Court of Appeals in Nouadhibou reduced his death sentence to a two-year jail term. He was supposed be released immediately as he had already been in jail for more than two years, reported the BBC. However, by May 2018 he still had not been released according to human rights groups. In late April 2018, the Mauritanian government even adopted a new, more stringent blasphemy law that could have alleged 'blasphemers' such as Mkhaitir subjected to the death penalty. 21 national and international organisations vehemently opposed the new law, including Center for Inquiry President Robyn Blumner at the United Nations Human Rights Council. On 30 July 2019, Mkhaitir's lawyer Fatimata Mbaye and the campaign group Reporters Without Borders reported that Mkhaitir had been released from prison and no longer in Nouakchott, though Mbaye said he 'is not completely free in his movements'. Mkhaitir thanked all the organisations who had been campaigning on his behalf ever since his arrest in January 2014. In October 2019, AFP reported that he had started a new life in Bordeaux, France where he continued his activism, having learned French during his time in prison.

Tucker, J.K. 2004 Catalog of recent and fossil turrids (Mollusca: Gastropoda). Zootaxa 682:1-1295. Description The length of the shell attains 8.9 mm (Original description) The thin, white shell is narrowly oblong or fusiform, with a longish, scarcely tumid body whorl, a shortish, conical, convexly whorled, small-pointed, shallow-sutured spire, and a long conical base. There are delicate thread-like curved, longitudinal lines of growth, which are strongest near the top of the whorls. The whole surface is equably covered with fine, faintly raised, rounded, spiral threads. They are slightly fretted by the longitudinals. Between them are little rounded furrows of about twice their breadth. The spiral threads are porcellanous, the furrows translucent white, and the surface is a little glossy. The spire is rather short, conical, but slightly concave, with hardly any interruption in its profile-lines by the very slightly impressed suture and the convexity of the whorls. The protoconch consists of 2½ rounded subcylindrical whorls rising to a small rounded point, where the extreme tip hardly projects and is bent down on one side. It is smooth and glossy, but retains traces of a ruddy epidermis with minute spiral threads. The shell contains 6 whorls in all. These are of regular but rapid increase, rather high and broad, convex, but sloping, and not tumid. The body whorl is very long and full, though not tumid. And there is little contraction on the long conical base. The suture is slightly impressed and rather oblique. The aperture is large, open, and oblong, pointed above, scarcely contracted below, but truncated at the end of the broad open siphonal canal. The outer lip is very equably curved in both its planes. It has a somewhat high and prominent shoulder above, between which and the body whorl lies the rather deep, wide, rounded sinus. The inner lip shows is a thin glaze on the body and on the long columella, which is cut off in front with a long, thin, twisted, oblique edge.Watson, R.B.

The majority of the remnant of the Umpila now live in Lockhart. Language Umpila is classified as one of the North Cape York Paman languages. It is one of 6 dialects which are often collectively referred to as Umpila, and, though classified as moribund, it is still spoken by elders, along with Kuuku Ya'u/Koko Yao and Kaantju, and efforts are being made to revitalize it. The process of replication in their tongue is unusual, creating forms that are bewilderingly varied. Country Umpila country has been called 'one of the most ecologically intact indigenous domains on earth.' It stretches over some around Cape Sidmouth north to Night Island, and to the Chester River. Their territory is very rich in its biodiversity heritage, with some 260 plant species unique to their region. To their north were the Uutaalnganu, while their southern borders ran up to those of the Lama Lama. History The Umpila were forcibly removed from their land in the 1940s. Most now live in the Lockhart River Community Society The Umpila call themselves Umpila pama malngkanichi, \\"people of the sand beach\\", a term which refers to their belonging to the ethnocultural group of Kawadji of north-eastern Queensland coastal dwellers. Their society had two exogamous patrimoieties, kaapay(karrpiya/ karpeya) and kuyan (koiyan), two terms which are also used to classify flora and fauna. The two patrimoieties marry their opposite moiety, resulting in the acquisition of the resulting children to the father's moiety. Strict rules also govern social interaction between certain grades of affine relationship. Two of the most knowledgeable informants, the tribal elder Horace Rocky and the young park ranger Johanne Omeenyo cannot speak to each other, since a classificatory nephew like Johanne is forbidden to speak directly to his 'uncle', and they must use clan intermediaries.

As his name suggests, he was probably born in Haguenau, before 1275. After having studied medicine and theology in Strasbourg and in Paris, he worked as a headmaster in Basel, Switzerland, before settling as a physician in Strasbourg, where he applied for the post of canon at the St Thomas' Church. He was at first rejected but successfully sued against that decision before the Apostolic Signatura in Rome, and was instated as canon of St Thomas' Church in 1300. He died on 26 September 1313 and is buried in the church, where his ornate Gothic ledger stone is preserved to this day. That monument depicts him in clerical attire and holding a book; the inscription says (the letters in brackets are missing): ANNO D[OMI]NI MCCCXIII VI KA[LENDAS] OCTOBR[IS] O[BIIT] MAG[ISTE]R GOZ[ZO] DE HAGENOWE MEDICUS CANONICUS S[ANCTI] THOME ARG[EN]T[INENSIS]. Gottfried is the author of an epic poem (4,134 rimed verses in Latin) on the life and the feasts of Mary, the Liber [book] sex festorum beatae Virginis (1293–1300), (also known as Carmen [song] sex festorum Beatae Mariae Virginis), dedicated to bishop Conrad of Lichtenberg. The original manuscript of that work has been studied by Johann Michael Moscherosch in 1653. It was unfortunately destroyed, along with the Hortus deliciarum, when the municipal library of Strasbourg was burnt during the Siege of Strasbourg in 1870. The poem is preserved through manuscript copies made in 1861 by , and earlier by Jérémie-Jacques Oberlin, and Eberhard Gottlieb Graff; those copies are kept in the National and University Library, and have been edited by the German scholar . In 1307, Gottfried introduced the Feast of the Immaculate Conception in the parish of St Thomas' Church, where it was celebrated until the church became Protestant in 1524. He donated his fortune to the parish for this purpose.

The show is currently on hiatus as of their 170th episode. The brand released two shows weekly, SmackJade (co-hosted with professional wrestler Jade Costello) and Raw in Fast Forward (co-hosted with Cork City F.C. commentator and sports columnist David Kent). The promotion, under the sub- name Low Blows Wrestling Parties, hosts regular wrestling-themed parties in Dublin which follow WWE's pay-per-view schedule, specifically Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Survivor Series. They also host bi-annual live podcasts in Dublin.  History  Low Blows began in April 2012 as an entity specifically tailored towards hosting WWE pay-per-view parties at Captain America's restaurant in Dublin. Then called WWE Parties Ireland, the budding company began as a Facebook page out to be '\\"a hub for wrestling fans to chat & have a laugh\\", and also provided a platform to promote independent wrestling shows around the country from brands such as Main Stage Wrestling and Celtic Championship Wrestling. At this stage, future host Rick Nash would begin to provide his own insights and critique on the WWE product via his wrestling blog, through which he would also announce details of future events hosted by the company. In April 2013, following their second successful WrestleMania party, the company began to host their own 'Hall of Fame' ceremony (mimicking the WWE Hall of Fame Ceremony carried out during the weekend of WrestleMania each year). It was at this stage that the popularity of the events began to outweigh the capacity of Captain America's, and as a result future events were announced to be staged in Woolshed Baa and Grill on Parnell Street, Dublin. Following continued success, Nash's critical articles garnered the attention of Irish sports outlet Balls.ie, who offered Nash a position as their professional wrestling correspondent beginning in June 2013. Through this position, Nash was able to extend the reach of the events through pay-per-view prediction leagues in his articles, the winner of which would be given complimentary access to a future event. Competitions were also able to be held throughout relevant news outlets, further promoting the brand and its events. In April 2014, in anticipation of their first WrestleMania event at the Woolshed venue, the first episode of Low Blows was released hosted by Nash and Don Marnell (now commentator for OTT Wrestling), an inductee of the company's hall of fame from the year prior. In February 2016, in an effort to distance themselves away from WWE and cultivate the Low Blows brand established with the podcast and their Twitter handle, the company was officially rebranded to Low Blows Wrestling Parties, introducing new branding to their events as of WrestleMania 32. In June 2016, the company hosted a campaign on behalf of a five-year-old Max Birmingham, who was then suffering from a relapse of stage four neuroblastoma cancer. Because of his fascination with wrestling, Max's mother contacted the company asking for any spare memorabilia that people could give while Max is in treatment as a means of distraction from his treatment. In response, the company's Money in the Bank party was labelled with #MemorabiliaForMax, and there was a collection of toys made to be donated to Max. Nash had to say on the matter \\"“Max and his family aren’t looking for money, just toys that people already have and can afford to give away. It’s something so small for people, but it’d make a huge difference\\". The event was so impactful that it drew the attention of WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley, who tweeted his support for the event saying \\"Please let me know where I can send Max some cool things\\".  Format  Low Blows in its current format is presented as 2 separate weekly shows, SmackJade and Raw in Fast Forward. SmackJade is hosted by Nash and professional wrestler Jade Costello, and focuses on wrestling news that has transpired over the course of the week. Raw in Fast Forward is hosted again by Nash and sports persona David Kent, and offers a more in depth view of WWE programming with specific focus on Raw and SmackDown Live. Both shows, while offering a critical view on the world of professional wrestling, are maintained in a lighthearted manner, often employing comedic bits which are segmented throughout the show and rely on audience participation. Current segments include 'Dave's Mystery PPV' (a segment where listeners must guess an unidentified pay-per-view through a series of clues) and '30 second warning' (a segment where listeners ring in to face off against the hosts in an attempt to win tickets to a future event). During live podcasts, the format will typically follow a panel-style where the audience asks questions to the hosts and any special guests they might have featured. On establishing the live podcasts, Marnell stated \\"Six months ago, Rick Nash approached me about co-hosting a wrestling comedy podcast -a niche market you might say. Here we are 20 episodes later and we are preparing to host our first live episode in front of an audience. Has anyone hosted a live comedy wrestling podcast before Probably not, but we’re going to give it a bash anyway!\\"  Pay-Per-View parties  The origins of Low Blows lie within the WWE pay-per-view parties hosted during the 'big four' pay-per-view events Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Survivor Series. These were initially held at Captain America's restaurant on Grafton Street before being moved to Woolshed Baa and Grill due to capacity issues. As of 2017, the parties have again been moved to Buskers on the Ball due to legal issues following the 2017 Royal Rumble. Each year, usually preceding their WrestleMania party, the company hosts their own 'Hall of Fame' ceremony in the style of WWE's Hall of Fame. 2017 marked the first time a live band appeared preceding one of the company's events. The Low Blows Band, a house band curated by the hosts of the podcast, performed a full concert based around wrestler's theme songs prior to their WrestleMania 33 party.

The couple's son Ernest Panckoucke (1808–1886) was also an editor in the publishing business and controlled Le Moniteur Universel. During the Second Empire, the Moniteur Universel was ceded to Paul Dalloz (1829–1887), who married a granddaughter of Charles-Joseph Panckoucke.

One of the last clashes in the Venetian–Genoese wars, the battle ended in a decisive Venetian victory. Background Tensions between the Republic of Venice and its old rival, the Republic of Genoa, rose again in 1402, as reports came in of Genoese pirates attacking Venetian merchant shipping. The Venetians authorised the captain-general of the Sea, Carlo Zeno, to mobilise the fleet and take measures to combat Genoese piracy. In April 1403, a Genoese fleet of nine galleys, seven round ships, a galleass, and a horse transport, had sailed from Genoa under the command of the French Marshal Boucicaut, and made for Cyprus, to strengthen Genoese influence there. On its way, the fleet passed by the Venetian outpost of Modon in southwestern Greece, but no hostilities took place, and Boucicaut led his fleet on to Cyprus. After carrying out his mission there, the French commander, a \\"fervent crusader\\", launched attacks on Muslim cities on the Levantine coast. Among others, Beirut was sacked, an event which angered the Venetians further since most of the booty the Genoese took there actually belonged to Venetian merchants. In September, Boucicaut, at the head of eleven galleys and two transport cogs, set sail for the return journey. Battle The Genoese fleet arrived at Modon on 4 October, only to find a Venetian fleet of eleven galleys and two round ships waiting for them. Anticipating a battle, Zeno moved his ships out into the bay, while the Genoese anchored at the offshore island of Sapienza. In the early morning of 7 October the Genoese started to sail north, but were pursued by the Venetians. The ensuing battle was hard-fought, particularly between the flagships of the two opposing fleets, which closed on one another and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The battle was decided by the Venetian round ship Pisana, which captured three Genoese galleys, leading Boucicaut to break off and retreat. The Genoese had 600 casualties, and a further 300 as prisoners of war aboard the three captured vessels, while the Venetians had suffered only 153 wounded. Aftermath The internal instability of Genoa meant that this was the last major challenge offered by the Genoese to Venetian maritime hegemony and its dominance of the eastern trade routes. The latter would be soon shaken, however, by the inexorable rise of the Ottoman Empire.

Since 1992, Ålands Konstmuseum (Åland's Art Museum) has presented a permanent exhibition of works by the artists who painted there.

Its mission is to improve health and well-being through sleep education and advocacy. Purpose Its mission is to improve health and well-being through sleep education and advocacy. NSF’s goals are to ensure that: # Sleep is used as a vital sign of health by medical professionals and the public; # The biological sleep/wake process is common knowledge; # Workplaces, schools, homes and transportation infrastructures are designed to be sleep-friendly; and # Sleep science is rapidly incorporated into products and services.  Research  = NSF Sleep Duration Recommendations = NSF Sleep Duration Recommendations Chart developed based on NSF's research paper In 2015 NSF released the results of a world-class, research study on sleep duration recommendations. The paper titled \\" National Sleep Foundation’s sleep time duration recommendations: methodology and results summary\\" was published in the peer-reviewed Sleep Health Journal. NSF convened an expert panel of 18 leading scientists and researchers tasked with updating the official sleep duration recommendations. The panelists included sleep specialists and representatives from leading organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association of Anatomy, American College of Chest Physicians, American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Geriatrics Society, American Neurological Association, American Physiological Society, American Psychiatric Association, American Thoracic Society, Gerontological Society of America, Human Anatomy and Physiology Society, and Society for Research in Human Development. The panelists participated in a rigorous scientific process that included reviewing over 300 current scientific publications and voting on how much sleep is appropriate throughout the lifespan. = Sleep Health Index = NSF developed Sleep Health Index to measure sleep health at a global group or at an individual level. It was created with the help of sleep experts and public opinion research experts. It is composed of three sub-component scales: sleep duration, sleep quality, and sleep disorders. The Index is fielded quarterly and results are publicly available. = Sleep in America Poll = NSF has conducted a national poll called Sleep in America Poll to catalog the state of sleep in America since 1991. This poll provides valuable information to the public, sleep community and the media on specific topics of interest. Past Sleep In America poll data and results are available on the Sleep Health Journal website. The following lists past poll topics: * 2019 - Sleep Health and Scheduling * 2018 - Sleep Prioritization and Personal Effectiveness * 2015 - Sleep and Pain * 2014 - Sleep in the Modern Family * 2013 - International Bedroom Poll * 2013 - Exercise and Sleep * 2012 - Transportation Workers’ Sleep * 2012 - Bedroom Poll * 2011 - Poll, Technology and Sleep * 2011 - Bedroom Poll * 2010 - Sleep and Ethnicity * 2009 - Health and Safety * 2008 - Sleep, Performance and the Workplace * 2007 - Women and Sleep * 2006 - Teens and Sleep * 2005 - Adult Sleep Habits and Styles * 2004 - Children and Sleep * 2003 - Sleep and Aging * 2002 - Adult Sleep Habits = Sleep Health: Journal of the National Sleep Foundation = Sleep Health: Journal of the National Sleep Foundation (“Sleep Health”) is NSF’s official, peer-reviewed academic journal. It was launched in 2015. The Journal’s aims are to explore sleep’s role in population health and bring the social science perspective on sleep and health. Its scope extends across diverse sleep-related fields, including anthropology, education, health services research, human development, international health, law, mental health, nursing, nutrition, psychology, public health, public policy, fatigue management, transportation, social work, and sociology. The Journal was 2016 winner of the Association of American Publishers’ PROSE Award for Best New Journal in Science, Technology and Medicine. The PROSE Awards annually recognize the very best in professional and scholarly publishing by bringing attention to distinguished books, journals, and electronic content. The Journal had a CiteScore of 3.44 calculated using data from April 30, 2019. = Sleep Monitoring Standards = In 2014 NSF encouraged the Consumer Electronic Association (CEA) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to develop standards for sleep technology. As a result, the R6.4 WG1 Sleep Monitors Group was established, composed of sleep experts and technology manufacturers. In September 2017, CEA and NSF announced a new standard for measuring sleep cycles with wearables and other applications. The new standard expands on 2016’s work that defined terms and functionality required for sleep measuring devices.  Education  = Public education = NSF educates the public about sleep health in content that appears through online, print and broadcast media. NSF-branded sleep health content appears on sleepfoundation.org and sleep.org. NSF’s public education websites are drowsydriving.org and sleepforkids.org. = Physician education = The National Sleep Foundation is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians. In March 2017, NSF was awarded Accreditation with Commendation by the ACCME. Accreditation with Commendation is ACCME’s mechanism for celebrating organizations that excel. Many of NSF’s physician education courses are found in the Sleep Learning Zone, an online learning platform. Sleep information resources are also found in The Sleep Disorders, a sleep primer for primary care physicians and non-sleep specialists.  Public Awareness  = Sleep Awareness Week = Sleep Awareness Week is NSF’s annual public awareness event celebrating sleep health. It usually occurs during the week leading up to the beginning of daylight-saving time in the spring. During this week, NSF releases the results from its annual Sleep in America Poll or from the Sleep Health Index. NSF provides valuable information about the benefits of optimal sleep and how sleep affects health, well-being, and safety. The week-long campaign provides the public and the media with shareable messages including an infographic, sleep health messaging, and social media posts. = Drowsy Driving Prevention Week = NSF conducts an annual Drowsy Driving Prevention Week during the week leading up to the end of daylight-saving time in the fall. The campaign goal is to reduce the number of drivers who choose to drive while sleep deprived. Drowsy driving is responsible for more than 6,400 U.S. deaths annually. These fall-asleep crashes are often caused by voluntarily not getting the sleep one needs. Millions of Americans also experience excessive sleepiness as a result of sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy. The campaign encompasses dissemination of educational messages via social media.  Digital publications  NSF created sleepfoundation.org and sleep.org. In 2019 sleepfoundation.org won the Award for Excellence and sleep.org won the Award for Distinction both in the “Websites, General, Non-Profit” category at the 25th Annual Communicator Awards hosted by the Academy of Interactive & Visual Arts (AIVA). Founded nearly three decades ago, The Communicator Awards receives over 6,000 entries from companies and agencies of all sizes, making it one of the largest awards of its kind in the world. As of 2019, sleepfoundation.org and sleep.org are operated by Health Media Forward. NSF’s independently developed content appears on these and other platforms across the globe. NSF's public education websites are drowsydriving.org which supports NSF's Drowsy Driving initiatives, including the annual Drowsy Driving Prevention Week campaign, sleepforkids.org and sleephealthjournal.org which supports NSF's peer-reviewed research journal Sleep Health. The Sleep Disorders found on sleepdisorders.thensf.org publishes a free online sleep resource for primary care physicians, allied health professionals and non- sleep specialists.

Each year the National Sleep Foundation recognizes innovative sleep products by giving out the SleepTech Awards, the world's first innovation awards targeted specifically at sleep technology. Recent winners are: * 2019 - SleepTech Award Winner: The ReST Bed * 2019 - SleepTech App Award Winner: Timeshifter - The Jet Lag App * 2018 - SleepTech Award Winner: Happiest Baby - SNOO Smart Sleeper Finances The foundation's programs are funded by corporate and individual contributions, and through its partnerships with corporations and government entities. Its recent revenues are in the $3.5 million range. Controversies The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) declared insufficient sleep a \\"public health epidemic\\" in 2014. But, the NSF Sleep in America poll began providing evidence of the size and scope of the American sleep problem in 1991. The 2002 Sleep in America poll (1,010 people surveyed) first suggested that as many as 47 million Americans were risking injury and health problems because they weren't sleeping enough. Media coverage included headlines, \\"Epidemic of daytime sleepiness linked to increased feelings of anger, stress and pessimism.\\" Again, in NSF’s 2005 Sleep in America poll, it reported that half of adults report frequent sleep problems and 77 percent reported a partner with a sleep problem, with snoring being the most common complaint. Media coverage of 2002 Sleep in America poll suggested a sleep \\"crisis\\" and an \\"epidemic.\\" But these reports led to criticism from Public Citizen's Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe who theorized that \\"Although they're not saying you should be on a sleeping pill, they're saying go to the doctor and that doctor will sell you a sleeping pill in a large proportion of instances.\\" At that time, Dr. Wolfe also went on to criticize American doctors for \\"selling\\" sleeping pills, \\"even if it's not what (the patient) really need(s).\\" A 2016 NSF public education program highlighting \\"personal stories about sleep for four individuals\\" received grant support from Merck. Some merchants and products have claimed to be \\"endorsed by the National Sleep Foundation\\" or have implied such endorsement in their literature. My Pillow made such claims in its very-frequently-run television ads. In 2016, My Pillow agreed to stop claiming an NSF endorsement and paid a fine.

He pulls the branch down to the ground, fooling the chipmunks into clearing his path as well, and then walks into his house, laughing. Annoyed, the chipmunks approach the house and discovers that Donald's trying to pop some popcorn. While he goes out to collect some firewood, the chipmunks enter the house and try to eat the popcorn. They aren't able to chew it, and a frustrated Chip kicks some bits of corn into the fireplace, which pops. Donald returns and pops a bowl of popcorn, but the chipmunks find a way to steal his bowl. The duck enters a fierce battle with the chipmunks for possession of the popcorn, which ends with Donald trying to burn down Chip and Dale's tree. The duo immediately find another box of popcorn, and pour it down on the fire, causing a whole shower of popcorn to cover the front of Donald's house. Concluding the short, a disgruntled Donald ends up having to clear popcorn out of his walkway.

Nyamayaro is also the head of HeForShe, a movement founded by UN Women to empower all humans, especially men and boys, to have a voice and take action to achieve gender equality in their own lifetime. Early life and education Nyamayaro was born to a Zambian mother and is one of four children. She was raised by her grandmother in a village in Zimbabwe ridden with HIV and famine. Rather than attending school, she did household chores and looked for food wherever she could. After a drought in the eighties left her village famished, Nyamayaro encountered UNICEF for the first time. This was the first time famine hit in her community and she benefited from U.N. aid workers feeding her from time to time. After that experience, it became her goal to work for the United Nations and help and uplift others like she had been helped. It was after the first famine that her family was split up and she stayed with her grandmother while her parents, brother, and two sisters went to the capital of Harare to look for work and opportunity. When she was 10 years old, her aunt had enough money to bring her to the capital of Harare and attend a private school with British kids which was her first time in school. This was a defining moment in her life as she experienced inequality for the first time because she did not fit in at school but she also felt superior to her village as she was now more educated. She left Zimbabwe when she was 21 to attend a small college in Notting Hill Gate, London. After living in London and Geneva, Nyamayaro now resides in New York City. Nyamayaro received her MSc in Politics from the London School of Economics and Political Science. Nyamayaro also attended Harvard Business School.

Historically, fruit salts were sold for a wide range of ailments, and today they are used primarily as antacids. History In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, scientists began uncovering the chemical make-up and physiological benefits of various salts such as Glauber's salt and Epsom salts. The fact that these were found in mineral springs led to the rise of spas, where people would go to bathe in and drink mineral-rich waters for their health. These developments led to attempts to replicate the salt mixtures found in these naturally occurring mineral waters using off-the-shelf ingredients. Mixing these kinds of salts — especially carbonates and tartrates — with flavorings like lemon into an effervescent compound with citric or tartaric acid proved especially popular and set off a craze for the new \\"fruit salts\\". The name comes not from the popular fruit flavorings but from the fact that the acid in the mixture — which was then sourced from either citrus fruit (citric acid) or grapes (tartaric acid) — forms further salts such monosodium citrate in solution with the carbonates or tartrates. \\"Fruit salt\\" thus refers both to the fruit-derived salts formed in solution and metonymically to the mixture as a whole. ad for Eno's 'Fruit Salt' In 1852, the British pharmacist James Crossley Eno started selling such a fruit salt mixture from his pharmacy in the port city of Newcastle upon Tyne. Eno gave away his mixture to seafarers at the port, and in this way the name Eno became associated with fruit salts around the world. In 1868, he formally founded the company Eno's 'Fruit Salt' Works. Eno's success spawned many competitors in both Great Britain and the United States, including Abbey's Effervescent Salts, Dunn's Fruit Salt, Slaven's California Fruit Salt, and Dr. Edison Obesity Fruit Salts, for which in 1897 performer Alice J. Shaw became one of the earliest celebrity spokespersons for a weight loss product. In the style of patent medicines and quackery, they were advertised hyperbolically for an enormous range of diseases and ailments, only some of which they could ameliorate (e.g. indigestion). The range spanned from cholera to gout, rheumatism, colds, fevers, biliousness, indigestion, diarrhea, pimples, and headaches. As the pharmaceutical industry moved away from cure-all patent medicines in the mid twentieth century, Eno Fruit Salt became one of the only surviving products of its kind. Currently owned by GlaxoSmithKline, Eno Fruit Salt is today sold as an antacid, and its main ingredients are now sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, and citric acid. Its main market is in India.

It allows users to ask, answer and comment on graduate-level physics questions, post and review manuscripts from ArXiv (which lists PhysicsOverflow discussion pages among its trackbacks) and other sources, and vote on both forms of content. In addition to the two primary forms of content, the PhysicsOverflow community also welcomes discussions on unsolved problems, and hosts a chat section for discussions on topics generally of interest to physicists and students of physics, such as those related to recent events in physics, physics academia, and the publishing process. History PhysicsOverflow was started in April 2014 as a physics-equivalent of MathOverflow by Rahel Knöpfel, a physics PhD at the University of Rostock, high-school student Abhimanyu Pallavi Sudhir, and Roger Cattin, a retired professor of computer science at the University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland. The site was initially a mere question-and- answer forum, as it was started by users dissatisfied by the policies of the Physics Stack Exchange, but it was eventually expanded to include a Reviews section in October 2014. Moderation practices PhysicsOverflow is well- known for its liberal moderation policy and hesitation to block contributors except for spam, as reflected in the website's bill of \\"user rights\\". The content is largely community-moderated, much like MathOverflow, although exceptions have been recorded. Although the site's moderation policy is publicly available as part of the moderator manual, the site has been criticised for the excessive dispersion of policy-related material, such as the FAQ, the Bill of Rights, the moderator list and the Community Moderation threads, leading to reduced transparency. In response, the site's administrators posted a bulletin of all moderation-related content on the site on the homepage. Technical details The PhysicsOverflow discus as it appears in the PhysicsOverflow logo. PhysicsOverflow runs Question2Answer, an open-source Q&A; software, with a custom theme and several plugins and patches. Some of its plugins have been used by other Question2Answer websites, such as the Open Science Q&A; and the Physics Problems Q&A.; Usage Quantcast records around 3000 monthly visitors and between 20,000 and 50,000 global page views to PhysicsOverflow every month, over half of whom are located in four countries: the United States (26.8%), India (9.2%), the United Kingdom (8.5%), and Germany (6.4%). However, according to PhysicsOverflow's own data, only around 1500 users actually contribute content to the site, and 440 are active at a given point in time. Recognition The creation of PhysicsOverflow was well-received by the MathOverflow community. PhysicsOverflow was also featured at the 5th Offtopicarium and World Scientific's Asia-Pacific Physics News Letter. * John Baez suggested the website as a platform for discussing research-level physics questions. * Greg Bernhardt, the founder of PhysicsForums, acknowledged the site as a \\"very interesting development for the physics discussion communities\\". * Arnold Neumaier, a professor at the University of Vienna, employs PhysicsOverflow as the platform for discussion about his Theoretical Physics FAQ. * String theorist Lubos Motl referred to the website as a \\"very promising competition [to Physics Stack Exchange]\\". * The University of Stavenger's cosmology department commented that PhysicsOverflow \\"seems to implement some interesting ideas\\", and that \\"it makes some sense the review the reviewing process\\". * Urs Schreiber publicised the site, claiming it could act as a catalyst to make physics academia more open like mathematics.

Thus, White is left with pawns, golds, silvers, and the left knight. Black has the usual setup of twenty pieces. The 5-Piece handicap is not currently part of the Japan Shogi Association's official list of handicaps. It is also not commonly used. Although uncommon, many professionals feel that the 5-Piece is useful as there is a very large difference between 4-Piece and 6-Piece handicaps according to Kaufman. Openings =Bishop-66 Opposing Rook variation= 1...G-72. White opens with their right gold. White is more free to focus on the right side of their board compared to the 6-Piece handicap since White's left camp has a stronger defense due to the addition of the left knight. In particular, the knight protects the 33 square from the beginning. So, when Black opens their bishop diagonal in which their bishop is attacking White's 33, White does not immediately need to move a general to defend that square. Similarly, the knight also protects the edge at 13 and does not require an immediate defense if Black's bishop is positioned to attack along the 79–13 diagonal (targeting the 13 square). Therefore, White's left silver and gold are more available to defend toward the center of the board. 2. P-76. Black opens their bishop diagonal activating their bishop. 2...P-84. White pushes their eighth file pawn forward in order to make way for their right gold. 3. B-66. Black moves their bishop to the sixth file in order to support an attack on Black's left side. The move also forces White to move their generals to this side. 3...G-83. White is forced to the defend the pawn on 84 as well as their right edge. 4. P-86. Black will develop an Opposing Rook attack up the eighth file, which the pawn push prepares for. 5. R-88. Opposing Rook. 5...P-64. White pushes the sixth file pawn to prepare for an attack on the head of Black's bishop. 6. P-56. Black advances their central pawn in order to give their bishop a path of retreat (the 57 square) from White's encroaching pawn while still maintaining pressure on the right edge of White's camp. 5-Piece Left Knight handicap The other five piece handicap is the left knight variant. It is the same as the more common handicap except with White's left knight removed instead of the right knight. (Thus, White plays with pawn, golds, silvers, and the right knight.) According to Kaufman, this handicap is intermediate between the 6-Piece handicap and the usual 5-Piece (Right Knight) handicap mentioned above. It is a more severe handicap for White since Black's major pieces (the rook and bishop) are targeted toward White's left side. Therefore, removing White's left knight leaves White in a more vulnerable state compared to the Right Knight 5-Piece handicap.

Jacoby designed the home as his personal residence. The building's initial project was completed in 1923; the final project and building were finished in 1924. The architectural solution follows the conservatism of the 1920s which was greatly influenced by 17th and 18th century Baroque styles. The architecture has several references to the Old Town of Tallinn including white-washed roof ridges and Baroque door hinges. Initially, a late medieval lintel stone internal portal had been walled to the pergola internal wall with the owner's family signs and the year 1596. That stone has since been moved to Tallinn City Museum. During the Soviet Period, the building was used as communal style shared living quarters.

Robotic governance describes the impact of robotics, automation technology and artificial intelligence on society from a holistic, global perspective, considers implications and provides recommendations for actions in a Robot Manifesto. This is realized by the Robotic Governance Foundation, an international non-profit organization.Robotic Governance Foundation: Robotic & A.I. Governance Foundation. In: Robotic & A.I. Governance. (roboticgovernance.com) The robotic governance approach is based on the German research on discourse ethics. Therefore, the discussion should involve all Stakeholders, including scientists, society, religion, politics, industry as well as labor unions in order to reach a consensus on how to shape the future of robotics and artificial intelligence. The compiled framework, the so-called Robot Manifesto, will provide voluntary guidelines for a self- regulation in the fields of research, development as well as use and sale of autonomous and intelligent systems. The concept does not only appeal on the responsibility of researchers and robot manufacturers, but like with child labor and sustainability, also means a raising of opportunity costs. The greater public awareness and pressure will become concerning this topic, the harder it will get for companies to conceal or justify violations. Therefore, from a certain point it will be cheaper for organizations to invest in sustainable technologies and accepted.  History of the concept  The idea to set ethical standards for intelligent machines is not a new one and undoubtedly has its roots in science fiction literature. Even older is the discussion about ethics of intelligent, man-made creatures in general. Some of the earliest recorded examples can be found in Ovid's Metamorphoses, in Pygmalion, in the Jewish golem mysticism (12th century) as well as in the idea of Homunkulus (Latin: little man) arisen from the alchemy of the Late Middle Ages. The fundamental and philosophical question of these literary works is what will happen, if humans presume to create autonomous, conscious or even godlike creatures, machines, robots or androids. While most of the older works broach the issue of the act of creation, if it is morally appropriate and which dangers could arise, Isaac Asimov was the first to realize the necessity to restrict and regulate the freedom of action of machines. He wrote the first Three Laws of Robotics. At least since the use of drones equipped with air-to- ground missiles in 1995 that can be used against ground targets, like e.g. the General Atomics MQ-1, and the resulting collateral damage, the discussion on the international regulation of remote controlled, programmable and autonomous machines attracted public attention. Nowadays, this discussion covers the entire range of programmable, intelligent and/or autonomous machines, drones as well as automation technology combined with Big Data and artificial intelligence. Lately, well-known visionaries like Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates brought the topic to the focus of public attention and awareness. Due to the increasing availability of small and cheap systems for public service as well as commercial and private use, the regulation of robotics in all social dimensions gained a new significance.  Scientific recognition  Robotic governance was first mentioned in the scientific community within a dissertation project at the Technical University of Munich, supervised by Professor Dr. emeritus Klaus Mainzer. The topic has been the subject of several scientific workshops, symposia and conferences ever since, including the Sensor Technologies & the Human Experience 2015, the Robotic Governance Panel at the We Robots 2015 Conference, a keynote at the 10th IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO), a full day workshop on Autonomous Technologies and their Societal Impact as part of the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM’16), a keynote at the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Cloud and Autonomic Computing (ICCAC), the FAS*W 2016: IEEE 1st International Workshops on Foundations and Applications of Self* Systems, the 2016 IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Innovative Business Practices for the Transformation of Societies (IEEE EmergiTech 2016) and the IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC 2016). Since 2015 IEEE even holds an own forum on robotic governance at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IEEE IROS): the first and second \\"Annual IEEE IROS Futurist Forum\\", which brought together worldwide renowned experts from a wide range of specialities to discuss the future of robotics and the need for regulation in 2015 and 2016. In 2016 Robotic governance has also been the topic of a plenary keynote presentation on the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2016) in Daejeon, South Korea. Several video statements and interviews on robotic governance, responsible use of robotics, automation technology and artificial intelligence as well as self-regulation in a world of Robotic Natives, with internationally recognized experts from research, economy and politics are published on the website of the Robotic Governance Foundation. Max Levchin, co-founder and former CTO of PayPal emphasized the need for robotic governance in the course of his Q&A; session on the South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) 2016 in Austin and referred to the comments of his friend and colleague Elon Musk on this subject. Gerd Hirzinger, former head of the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics of the German Aerospace Center, showed during his keynote speech at the IROS Futurist Forum 2015 the possibility of machines being so intelligent that it would be inevitable, one day, to prevent certain behavior. At the same event, Oussama Khatib, American roboticist and director of the Stanford robotics lab, advocated to emphasize the user acceptance when producing intelligent and autonomous machines. Bernd Liepert, president of the euRobotics aisbl – the most important robotics community in Europe – recommended to establish robotic governance worldwide and underlined his wish for Europe taking the lead in this discussion, during his plenary keynote at the IEEE IROS 2015 in Hamburg. Hiroshi Ishiguro, inventor of the Geminoid and head of the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory at the University of Osaka, showed during the RoboBusiness Conference 2016 in Odense that it is impossible to stop technical progress. Therefore, it is necessary to accept the responsibility and to think about regulation. In the course of the same conference, Henrik I. Christensen, author of the U.S. Robotic Roadmap, underlined the importance of ethical and moral values in robotics and the suitability of robotic governance to create a regulatory framework.

According to the 2010 Census its population stands at slightly above 51,000. It is located in the approximate centre of the province, and on the T3 Road (Kitwe-Chingola Dual Carriageway) between the cities of Kitwe and Chingola. It was re-established in 1963 as a company township for the mine workers of Chambishi Mine which was under Chibuluma Mine of Kalulushi. This was after an announcement by Sir Ronald Prain, Chairman of Roan Selection Trust, in May 1962 that the company was going to open up the Chambishi open pit-pit mine at a cost of 7.5 million British Pounds. Chambishi has been under civic administration of Kalulushi Municipal Council from 1963, another mining town on the Copperbelt Province of Zambia. Etymology The name Chambishi comes from two Lamba words “Cha” and “mbishi”. Cha means “belonging to” or “an area of” while “mbishi” is a Lamba word for a zebra. The area was home to larger herds of zebras a century ago. Therefore, Chambishi means a place of zebras. History =George Grey founder of Chambishi= Captain George Grey is credited to be the founder of Chambishi in 1899. He was a prospector for Tanganyika Concessions Limited a company formed by Robert Williams a former associate of Cecil Rhodes. The same year 1899 Grey visited a village in North- Western Zambia under Chief Kansanshi who showed him a nearby copper mine, to which Grey gave the chief's name. Grey with four prospectors and 25 armed Africans, claimed the Chambishi, Nkana (Kitwe) and Kansanshi copper workings on the southern side of the border. He also played a major role in discovering major copper ore bodies in Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. He died in 1911 at the age of 45 in a Nairobi hospital, Kenya after two of his bullets failed to stop a charging lion on the Kapiti plains. William Collier a prospector working for Sir Edmund Davies, pegged claims on the Luanshya Mine and Bwana Mkubwa deposits in 1902, making the year one of the important ones in the history of mining in Zambia. The following year Collier pegged further claims around the ancient workings at Chambishi, where the peggings of an earlier prospector, George Grey in 1899, had been slightly off target. =Real impetus came after the First World War= After the First World War the demand for copper by the automobile and the electrical industries skyrocketed. Another important development was the treatment of lower grade ores using the flotation method by Minerals Separation Limited of London. Copper sulphide ores in Northern Rhodesia became more attractive than oxide ores in Katanga. This is because the recovery of copper from the mine's ores improved from 50% to 90% . This last discovery changed the outlook for Zambia forever. Through various agents, Cecil Rhodes, after whom Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) were named, obtained mineral concession rights from Chiefs and as a result, claimed ownership of mineral right in Zambia; his company, the British South Africa Company, retained these until the independence of the country in 1964. After realizing that mining was a labour and capital intensive operation, the BSAC decided to change the policy of granting prospecting licenses to individuals as it had done in the past, instead companies with sound financial means were invited to prospect over larger areas. This prompted well financed concerns with technical expertise to come on board. Alfred Chester Beatty, a London-based mining financier whose holding company, Selection Trust Limited (Roan Antelope Mine, Chambishi, Mufulira and Bwana Mkubwa) provided some funds in 1920; and Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, founder of Anglo American Corporation (Nchanga, Nkana, Bankroft- Chililabombwe Mines), joined forces in 1924. =Chambishi develops= Though copper was discovered at Chambishi in 1899 and rediscovered in 1902, the mining camp was not born until 1927 when the board of Selection Trust Limited in London approved a development programme and drilling started. In 1927, Chambishi's white total population was estimated to be around 50. The number of indigenous Lamba people was estimated to be above a couple of hundred. Chief Nkana was the senior traditional leader in the area. Russell Johnson Parker was the first Mine Manager while Lewin Tucker took up a position of mine secretary in 1927. The chief assayer was Jerry Haynes who later worked as smelter superintendent at Mufulira Mine; and, among the geologists, Dr. Anton Grey, (chief geologist), Dr. David Donaldson, Jock Brown and Bill Garlick who was a replacement geologist for Dr. T.F. Andrews and a Mr. Heins who had drowned in Chibuluma. Others who worked at Chambishi Mines in 1927 include, Phil Melville who was chief surveyor while E. P. Edwards worked as mining engineer. George Hornby, a contractor in charge of pitting was one of the Europeans who arrived early at Chambishi. Alabama Patton an American miner and Motoka Mukonkaus an African surveyor's assistant were also based there. When Lewin Tucker arrived at Chambishi, drilling was being carried out and preparations for shaft sinking had reached an advanced stage. The company built offices, workshops and houses for mine workers using Kimberly bricks. Chambishi also boasted of a couple of well stocked shops although most of the shopping was conducted at Nkana (Kitwe). For recreational activities the residents in Chambishi played tennis, had an occasional dance and went for hunting trips at weekends. Even though Chambishi could not support a football team as the white population was small, it did however, had its own nine-hole golf course, which attracted golfers from all over the Copperbelt. Phil Melville working as a chief surveyor at Chambishi made a unique revelation about the original road from Mufulira to Ndola. He said the road went first of all to Chambishi, then bypassed Nkana (Kitwe) by a few miles and continued to Luanshya and then went on to Ndola. The linking of the three mines through this road most probably explains why Roan Selection Trust (RST) insisted that these mines (Mufulira, Bwana Mkubwa, Chambishi, Roan and Chibuluma) became part of the block. =The Great Depression= In the 1930s the situation changed completely when mines on the Copperbelt faced a series of production cuts owing to the global economic depression. Operations at Chambishi ground to a halt in 1932 and so were at Mufulira Mine. Only two mines Roan and Nkana, continued to operate at 30% capacity under a quota agreement reached by world's main producers. Never a large mining township by Copperbelt standards, Chambishi nevertheless was a happy and largely self- contained little township during its brief existence aptly described by those who lived in it as ‘’one happy family’’. Mining Chambishi is predominantly a mining town, with two of open pits mines at China’s Non Ferrous Africa Mining Corporation (NFCA) and the newly opened SINO Metals’ Mwambashi Mine. Apart from the underground mine at NFCA, another one has been opened at a place that used to be Nchanga Farms called South East Ore Body (SEOB) with an investment of $850 million. It also has a couple of multimillion-dollar smelting plants- Chambishi Copper Smelter and Chambishi Metals. SINO Metals has also opened up the Mwambashi Open Pit Mine in the southern part of the town and made a copper processing plant near Chambishi Metals. The Food Reserve Agency's branch at Chambishi is one of the largest in country with a capacity to hold a considerable number of metric tonnes of agricultural produce. Transportation =Railway= It is linked by freight lines from Mufulira, Chingola, Kitwe and Chambishi Mine. The nearest passenger rail line is in Kitwe. =Road= The Kitwe/Chingola Dual Carriageway (T3 Road) is the main highway that passes through Chambishi, going to Chingola in the north- west and Kitwe in the south-east. From Sabina, the M4 Road goes north-east to Mufulira and the Congo Pedicle while the M16 Road goes south to Kalulushi. =Airport= The nearest two airports to Chambishi are Southdown's in Kalulushi nearly 30 kilometres in the south-east, and Kasompe located north- west in Chingola some 28 kilometres. Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe formerly Ndola Airport is the nearby international airport 91 kilometres away in Ndola, the Copperbelt's provincial headquarters. Features in Chambishi The town is home to Chambishi Football Club that play Division One in the Zambian Football League. It is also home to Chambishi (Blue Zebras) Rugby Club.

These movements resulted in the settlement of the Aegean islands, Cyprus, Crete and the western coast of Asia Minor and the founding of new cities which afterwards became centers of the Greek civilization. The migrations were effected in consecutive waves by tribal groupings known as the Aeolic, Ionian, Doric and Achaean (Arcadian) migrations. These movements differed from the Greek colonisation of the Archaic period in that they were more ad hoc affairs instead of the result of a planned process of colonisation on the part of the mother city, and they are less well-documented historically, often with a mythologized or semi-legendary leader such as Hercules or Orestes being recorded as the leader of the colonists.  Movements within mainland Greece  = The establishment of the Dorians within Central Greece = Within the span of the 13th century BCE the Dorians, in all probability transplanted from the regions of Epirus and southern Macedonia, were moving farther south and exerting strong rule in the area of Central Greece with its centre of power in Doris. The Dorians who displaced the previous inhabitants of Southern Greece knew ironworking and there grew rapidly a great power in the hill country of Central Greece, out of which afterwards the Dorians which will have of necessity expanded southward into the regions which were inhabited in historical times by the Aetolians and the Locrians. In acquiring the region they displaced the previous inhabitants, the Dryopes, who fled to Euboea, to the islands of the Cyclades and to southern Argolis. In Euboea they set up a state, with its seat in Carystus while in southern Argolis they founded the cities of Hermione, Asine, Heiones and Mases. This movement of the Drupones was the first meaningful one in the region of Southern Greece in the shift from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. = The Dorian Invasion of the Peloponnese = Hypothetical diagram of population movements within Greece After their consolidation in the area of Stereas the Dorians organized a campaign against the wealthy and powerful kings of Achaea in the Peloponnese. They were joined in their campaign by two neighboring tribes, the Aetolians and the Boeotians who either simply fought alongside the Dorians or else found themselves under their authority in that period. In the middle of the 12th century BCE, the Dorians attacked the Peloponnese, crossing Strait of Rion with their fleet. According to the tradition they crossed into the Peloponnese at the narrows of Rion-Antirion, and from that arrival (by naus, \\"ship\\"), the city of Naupactus (modern pronunciation Nafpaktos) took its name. N.b. A more literal translation of this passage would add that the Lacedaemonians call the land Naupaktioi, while the Athenians call it Naupaktos. After their crossing into the Peloponnese, the Dorians split into four divisions and each of these moved to capture one of the principal Achaean kingdoms. One group under the leadership of Cresphontes moved on Messenia and captured the kingdom of Pylos. A second group under the leadership of Aristodemus moved on Laconia and established itself in Sparta, while the third under the leadership of Temenos took Argos and Mycenae. It is calculated that the destruction of Mycenae by the invasion of the Dorians occurred around 1150 BCE. Finally, a fourth group under the leadership of Aletes, son of Hippotes moved on the isthmus of Corinth and took the area around Corinth. The dominance of the Dorians in the Peloponnese brought further upheavals and changes in population. The Achaeans of Argolis moved northward and established themselves in the region of Achaea. From that region they displaced the Ionians who were administering it, and subsequently moved east from the region of Corinth. First establishing themselves in Euboea, displacing the previous inhabitants there, the Abantes and continued on to the Aegean and the coast of Asia Minor. The Ionians of Attica were able to repulse the invasion of the Dorians, as evidenced by the continuity of their kingship of Codrus morphing into the archonship (or kingship) of his son Medon. The settlement of Asia Minor and the Aegean =Aeolian migration= Ancient Greece Map In the same period that the Dorians moved on the Peloponnese, others carried out their own movements within Greece proper. The Thessalians, from their first appearance in the area of Thesprotia, moved into the area of Thessaly, displacing the earlier Aeolophone tribe who inhabited that area. Among these tribes who lived in Thessaly before the establishment of the Thessalians were the Boeotians, who moved southward and established the area of Boeotia. Other populations of Thessaly and the previous inhabitants of Boeotia fled to the region of the Northeast Aegean after the loss of their territories and established themselves first in Lesbos and Tenedos and the Moschonesi (Fragrant Isles). These inhabitants were later called Aeolians from the name of a Thessalic tribe who had taken part in the migration. The Aeolians next colonised the opposite shore of Asia Minor, which was named Aeolis. Herodotus relates the founding of twelve cities in that section of Asia Minor. They were as follows:Aegae, Aegiroessa, Gryneion, Cilla, Cyme, Larissa, Myrina, Neonteichos, Notion, Pitane, Smyrna and Temnus. In the 7th century BCE, the Aeolians also expanded into the Troad, founding the cities of Gargara Assos, Antandros, Cebre, Scepsis, Neandreia and Pitya. The Achaeans of the Peloponnese who followed the Aeolic speakers participated in the Aeolic resettlement. The received tradition records Orestes as an instigator of the relocation of the Aeolians, and the royal family of the Penthilides on Mytilene claimed descent from Orestes. =Ionian migration= Temple of Poseidon in Attica. The Ionians, before the arrival of the Dorians, lived in the northern Peloponnese, in Megaris, and in Attica. After the loss of their territories to the Dorians and Achaeans of Argolis, they moved farther east and were situated at first in Euboea, displacing the earlier inhabitants, the Abantes. In the middle of the eleventh century BCE they settled the northern Cyclades and, together with the Ionians of Attica, settled the islands of Samos and Chios and the central section of the Asia Minor coast is named after them Ionia. The Ionians founded twelve cities which maintained tribal ties and remained united in one common polity, the Ionian League. The cities of the league were Miletus, Myus, Priene, Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedus, Teos, Clazomenae, Erythrae, Phocaea and the island states Chios and Samos. A temple of Poseidon, in the area of Mycale, ended up being their religious centre. Other tribes such as the Achaeans of the Peloponnese, the Arcadians, the Abantai, the Minyes from Orchomenus, the Phocaeans and the Molossians established themselves apart from the Ionians, but in the area of Ionia. The Abantes established themselves in Chios and preceded the Ionians who established themselves there later. The settlement of the Achaeans from Pylia is related to that at Colophon, while Achaeans from Argolis were established in the area of Clazomenai. The further traditions of the Ionian cities are thought to be due to the leader of the migration being one of the descendants of Codrus, and their point of departure appears to have been Attica. =Dorian migration= Ruins of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World The Dorians who took Argos and Corinth expanded gradually throughout the northeast Peloponnese. After the failure to capture Attica, they turned toward the sea. With the Doric states of Argolis as their departure point they settled Aegina, the southern Cyclades, Cyprus, Crete, the Dodecanese and the southwestern coast of Asia Minor. Composed of various groups of Dorians from Troezen, they settled Halicarnassus; from Epidaurus, Cos, and from Argos, Rhodes, Crete, and the islands of the Cyclades. In the following years Dorians from Laconia also set up in Crete, on Thera (modern Santorini), on Milos and on Cnidus. The Dorian settlers of the regions of the Dodecanese and southwest Asia Minor joined in one form of common government, the Hexapolis, which encompassed the cities of Halicarnassus, Cnidus, Lindos, Ialysos, Camerius and Cos. The centre of the Dorians of Asia Minor was the temple of Apollo on the promontory of Triopios in Cnidus. Eventually the Halicarnassians were forbidden to participate in the ceremonies there, due to the sacrilege of one Agasicles.

Personal life  When Rossin was 16, her mother brought her to the Whitney Museum of American Art where she was attracted to Kiki Smith’s wax figures. Rossin expressed that the gallery exhibition had a profound impact on her career, saying “I hated them and I loved them because they were both repulsive and tender. These feelings kept competing and rolling over each other for the front of my mind.\\"  Career  = Solo Work = In 2015, Rossin’s exhibition, N=7 / The Wake in Heat of Collapse, located at SIGNAL in New York, New York, was a virtual reality simulation that employs the structure of side-scrolling gameplay to create an immersive, Oculus Rift-based experience. Additionally, in 2015, Rossin held her work, Shelter of a Limping Substrate, at the Elliott Levenglick Gallery. Shelter of a Limping Substrate refers to the underlying layer in 3D imaging. She created formal en plein air paintings, which then were reimagined in virtual reality CAD software. From October 15—November 14, 2015, Rachel held her work, Lossy, at the ZieherSmith, a contemporary art gallery in New York City. In Rossin’s words: “The exhibition posits that our relationship with reality isn't a separate virtual and real but looks more like a gradient between the two— with most of our modern lives being lived in the action of hopping from screen to screen. Like lossy compression, this process includes entropy as an inherent given— in optimizing what already exists by omitting the excess in worlds with their own internal logic.” From December 9, 2016—January 15, 2017, the exhibition, My Little Green Leaf was held in partnership with Art in General and kim? Contemporary Art Centre in Riga, Latvia. The installation piece interweaves the viewers interactive experience with virtual reality and physical space. In 2017, she debuted a piece The Sky is a Gap, where she mapped a room-scale virtual reality installation to move 3D time and explosions by the user's movements. = Group work = From January 19, 2017—March 3, 2017 Rossin participated in ‘The Unframed World’ located at the HeK (House of electronic Arts Basel) in Basel, Switzerland. This group exhibition presented various approaches in using virtual reality as an artistic medium. From March 17, 2017—May 31, 2017 Rossin is working with other artists at Chi K11 Art Museum in Shanghai, China. Rossin will be partaking in a group exhibition ‘ARS17’ at Kiasma located in Helsinki, Finland from March 31, 2017—January 14, 2018. This exhibition will stage international artists working under the theme of digital revolution.

Her 2017 project, Bending the River Back into the City, utilizes Los Angeles’s first water commons and allows the currency of water to create social capital The Optics and Sonic Divisions of Metabolic Studio have exhibited and performed widely, including at MASS MoCA, MA (2016), George Eastman House, NY (2013), Nevada Art Museum, NV (2014), Hammer Museum, CA (2015), and BBC Radio 3, UK (2014). Bon’s solo exhibitions are Hand Held Objects, at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, CA (2003) and Bees and Meat, at ACE Gallery, CA (2007)  Life and career  Bon's mother is Wallis Annenberg. Lauren Bon holds a Master of Architecture from MIT and a BA from Princeton. She trained as a dancer at the Bat-Dor Dance Company, Tel Aviv (1979); the Martha Graham Dance Company, New York (1982); and the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company, New York (1985). She also has been personal assistant to Isamu Noguchi (1983–85), and studied with artists Michael Singer (1988 and 1992); Elyn Zimmerman (1992); Magdalena Abakanowicz (1995). Helen and Newton Harrison are mentors and collaborators with Bon. She is also a trustee of the Annenberg Foundation.  Chronology of Actions  = Metabolic Studio (2005-present) = In 2005, Lauren Bon created Metabolic Studio. Derived from the Greek word for “change”, \\"metabolism” is the process that maintains life. In continuous cycles of creation and destruction, metabolism transforms nutrients into energy and form. The actions generated by Metabolic Studio are global in focus and reach: developing new tools for urban living and city planning; inventing novel social practices for political and environmental justice; and directing art practice to engage on the same scale as society’s capacity to destroy. Lauren Bon’s Metabolic Studio is a force for change, showing that another reality is possible and pointing the way new endeavors and practices in an age of economic and environmental scarcity. “ARTISTS NEED TO CREATE AT THE SAME SCALE THAT SOCIETY HAS THE CAPACITY TO DESTROY” proclaims a red neon sign on one wall of the Metabolic Studio in a warehouse on the edge of Chinatown in downtown Los Angeles. = Bending the River Back into the City (2012-present) = Lauren Bon’s current project is Bending the River Back into the City - a three-part sculpture consisting of a belowground tunnel that diverts water from the Los Angeles River, a seventy- two-foot waterwheel that lifts the water to publicly accessible bio- remediation gardens on the roof of the Metabolic Studio building, and a distribution network of users voluntarily receiving the newly clean water. In Bon’s vision, water that would otherwise bypass the city via the river (which is the catch for the rain) en route to the ocean (which is the catch for the river) will be captured for the benefit of Los Angeles’s arid landscape. This long-term project will clean LA River water to potable standards, and the water will become part of a distribution network that will deliver water to individuals, organizations, and institutions in Downtown LA. This phased project will begin to manifest in 2018 with the creation of an inflatable dam that will sit in the LA River—bending and driving a percentage of the river water through a diversion canal, and into a treatment facility. Bending the River Back into the City will eventually provide a waterwheel named LA Noria that reanimates the legacy of the waterwheels that drove water on and around the site in the 19th century. \\"Right now, all of the water that’s going out to sea does not reenter the city for any beneficial use, and that’s a paradigm that needs to shift. That’s the primary goal of La Noria.\\" = AgH2O (2008-present) = AgH20 a 240-mile work that aims at reconnecting Los Angeles with the elements that made it viable historically: silver and water, both mined from the mountains of the Owens Valley. This project connects these elements mined from the Owens Valley, silver and water, to the emergence of the film industry. = Strawberry Flag (2009-2010) = Strawberry Flag deployed an experimental aquaponic strawberry farm on an abandoned quadrangle of the West Lost Angeles Veterans Administration (VA) using plants rescued from a local farm where they would otherwise have been plowed under after having fruited only once. Part therapy, part art installation and part fundraiser, the project created a raised strawberry field in the shape of an American flag. Veterans tend the strawberries, transplanted from abandoned fields, and sell preserves they make from second-harvest fruit. = Farmlab (2006-2009) = Farmlab was a collective studio practice. The practice produced a large archive of objects, and video’s from the performative actions. Farmlab’s signature projects involved properties in downtown Los Angeles on often mismanaged by political agencies or poorly effected by real estate market forces. Two thousand public salons were hosted by Farmlab during its three-year history. The conversations examined land use, politics, activism, environmental crisis, food equity, biological remediation of social and physical brownfields, or places not capable of supporting life. = Not a Cornfield (2005–2006) = Not a Cornfield was a living sculpture that consisted of a cornfield planted on a 32-acre piece of land in the centre of Los Angeles. This cornfield was stewarded by Lauren Bon and a large team of collaborators and volunteers for a full agricultural cycle in 2005 – 2006. The project was founded upon a desire to redeem a plot of once fertile and now depleted and derelict urban territory, as a symbol of renewal and hope. It was also designed to expedite the process of turning the site, owned by the State of California, into a State Historic Park. “...we weren’t going to have a cornfield there forever. It was both a cornfield and not a cornfield,” she said. “It was a way of creating the potential for something else to occur there because the site had stalled in its process of becoming. And the cornfield was meant to galvanize it into that possibility again.” It’s not quite sculpture, either, though, she added, which “is often about its formal end being the subject of the work rather than consuming even its formal end into a greater notion of transformation.”  Books  * Not a Cornfield: Essays + Timeline and Photographs + Maps, Ed.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and one or two yellowish-green flowers with dark red markings. Description Caladenia tessellata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, sparsely hairy, linear to lance-shaped leaf, 50–100 mm long and 4–9 mm wide. Up to three yellowish-green flowers with dark red marks are borne on a thin, wiry stalk 20–150 mm tall. The sepals and petals taper to fine, short, thread-like tips. The dorsal sepal is erect at its base, then curves forward and is 15–25 mm long and 2–3 mm wide. The lateral sepals are 15–25 mm long and 3–5 mm wide, curve downwards and are nearly parallel to each other. The petals are 15–25 mm long and about 2 mm wide and also curve downwards. The labellum is cream-coloured to green, often with a dark red tip and is heart-shaped, 8–9 mm long and wide. The sides of the labellum often have a few short, blunt teeth, the tip is curled under and there are four to six rows of shiny black calli in the lower central part. Flowering occurs in September and October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia tessellata was first formally described by Robert Fitzgerald in 1876 and the description was published in his book Australian Orchids from a specimen collected in Hunters Hill. The specific epithet (tessellata) is a Latin word meaning \\"inlaid with small square stones\\" or \\"mosaic\\" in reference to the labellum appearing to be paved with short, thick calli. Distribution and habitat This caladenia is found in near-coastal areas from Swansea in New South Wales to Westernport Bay in Victoria although there is a more inland population near Braidwood. It usually grows in grassy woodland. Conservation Caladenia tessellata is known from about 19 populations containing a total of 450 plants. Six of these populations are in New South Wales, and in some, no plants have been observed for more than 20 years. The largest N.S.W. population is in the Morton National Park and in Victoria the largest is in the Wilsons Promontory National Park. The species is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threats to the species are habitat disturbance caused by activities such as road maintenance, trampling as many plants are near walking tracks, altered fire regimes and browsing by kangaroos and wallabies.

The theater was originally built as a vaudeville/movie theater in 1914. It was one of many theatres in Ashland to show silent films, during that era. The theatre was built in 1914 and owned by Abe and Louis Latts, along with Leon Schwager. The building was designed by noted architect Henry Wildhagen, who designed many buildings in northern Wisconsin, many of which are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building is of special historic interest, and is a contributing resource within the West Second Street Historic District, of downtown Ashland. With The two-story brick building has a three-part symmetrical facade, which was designed in the Neoclassical Revival Style. The finely detailed facade is united by the metal entablature that features a protruding metal cornice, which has a central elliptical arch, a paneled frieze, and metal globes that stand at the top of the central pilasters in the brickwork. There are brownstone quoins at the sides, as well as brownstone window sills. Originally, there was a cast iron canopy over the central entrance, with ornate light fixtures on either side, and the name Royal Theatre embossed on the front. One of the central features of the interior was a massive bronze sculpture of a lion, which was prominently displayed in the lobby. The sculpture was life-sized, and rested on a massive marble pedestal. Lions were featured throughout the overall design and motif of the building, and the sculpture in the lobby was an excellent example of the cultural depictions of lions in classical architecture. Eventually, a new marquee was added, with neon letters, in the Art Deco style, which didn't necessarily fit with the building's overall classical architecture. This marquee was later removed, after the theatre closed in 1957. In the 1960s the building was converted into space for retail stores. The building survived a fire in the 1960s, and luckily wasn't demolished.

In 2019, the company went out of business.  History  The product was accidentally developed in 1999 by Katie Sanchez while she was making apple jelly. The company was established in 2012, with a production facility in River Falls, Wisconsin.

John Smith of Nibley (d.1641), steward of the Berkeley estates, the biographer of the family and author of \\"Lives of the Berkeleys\\" wrote as follows concerning the disinheritance:Vol.2, p.173 ::\\"How little cause the Marquis Berkeley had to complain of the obscure parentage of the lady Isable, which he vainly called base, and of the unworthiness of his brother's match with so mean blood as he reproached it, making that a motive to his own vast expenses, and of the disinheritance of this Lord his brother, lest any of her base blood should inherit after him, may to his further reproof be returned upon his memory, to be but a feigned and unbrotherly quarrel picked on purpose to give colour to his own exorbitances. Like vain were his exceptions to his said brother and heir, for defending the virtue of his wife and worthiness of her parentage. She was a virtuous lady, and evermore content with better or harder fortunes.\\"Quoted from Masters :Maurice later managed to recover over 50 manors and other lands which had been alienated illegally by his brother.Richardson By her deceased first husband she was the mother of three children who had all died young.

Its purpose was for a priest to say masses for the souls of Thomas Mede, Philip Mede and Isabel his wife, John Sharpe and Elizabeth his wife, and Richard Mede and Elizabeth and Anne his wives, as specified in his will.Extract quoted in Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the subsequent suppression of chantries, the ornaments owned by the chantry were valued at 52 shillings and 8 pence and were in 1547-8 confiscated to the king's use.Masters The income of the chantry at the Dissolution was £17 1 shilling, a large sum.Harper-Bill, Christopher, Religious Belief and Ecclesiastical Careers in Late Medieval England, p.25 It had been endowed with various lands, including the land now covered by 8-11 Park Row, Bristol, then comprising two gardens, a lodge and a close.Leech, Roger, The St Michael's Hill Precinct of the University of Bristol: The Topography ..., p.112 Burial and monument From his will it appears that the surviving fine double monument,See image known as the \\"Mede Chantry (chapel)\\", at the east end of the North aisle of the choir of St. Mary Redcliffe Church, was erected on his order.Masters The monument comprises a beautiful heavily canopied double altar-tomb standing against the north wall of which the westernmost contains the recumbent effigies of a man and his wife, their heads resting upon cushions supported by angels. The man is bare- headed, his hair combed back, and is clad in a sleeveless mantle, from which emerge the arms and cuff of an undergown, a scarf hangs from his left shoulders, and a leathern gypciere from his girdle, his feet resting upon a couchant dog. His wife wears a broad fillet across her forehead, her head- dress falling back, a tight-fitting gown with cuffs at the wrists, and a short girdle, her pointed shoes enveloped in the folds of her dress, resting upon two little dogs.Masters On the wall behind the effigies is an heraldic escutcheon displaying the arms of Mede: Gules, a chevron ermine between three trefoils slipped argent, and upon a fillet of brass along its front is an incomplete Latin inscription: ... predicti Thoma(e) Mede, ac ter maioris istius villae Bristolliae, qui ob(ii)t 20 die mensis Decembris Anno D(omi)ni 1475 quoram animabus propicietur Deus, AmenMasters (\\"... of the foresaid Thomas Mede and thrice Mayor of this town of Bristol, who died on the 20th day of the month of December in the year of our Lord 1475, on the souls of whom may God look upon favourably, Amen\\"). It is reasonable to supposeMasters that the missing word before \\"predicti\\" may have been filius (\\"son\\") or frater (\\"brother\\"). The other compartment remains empty, but has the monumental brass of his son Richard Mede affixed to the rear wall (see above). Above both compartments is a handsome continuous canopy of rich stone carving, supported by demi-angels bearing open books, and wearing upright caps with hexagonal flowers upon their heads. Above them rise crocketed and finialled niches, surmounted by cornice and cresting.Masters Mede's Place Mede's Place, the seat of the Mede family in the parish of Wraxall in Somerset, is believed to have been situated on the high ground known as \\"the bowling green\\" and would have had a magnificent situation. No trace of it remains today.Masters In 1467 (two years after his daughter's marriage) \\"Philip Mede of Bristol, merchant\\" together with his wife Isabel and son Richard, jointly leased Mede's Place to his daughter Isabel and her husband Maurice Berkeley (\\"Maurice Bercley, Esquire\\"), for a term of 20 years. The original deed is held in the Berkeley Castle Muniments, and is summarised as:Berkeley Castle Muniments, BCM/A/2/88/2 \\"Philip, Isabel and Richard have leased to Maurice and Isabel the holding in Feylond in the parish of Wroxsale called Medeisplace; for a term of 20 years, rent 45s. 8d. a year. Witnesses: Richard Arthur, Esquire, Ralph Percevale, Thomas Feylond\\". Soon after the death of Lady Berkeley (née Isabel Mede) in 1516, Mede's Place appears to have been acquired by the Morgan family, lords of the manor of Easton in Gordano, as Thomas Morgan \\"of Feilond\\", by his will dated 1567, bequeaths to Edmund Morgan, his eldest son, \\"the house of Feilonde called Medes Court\\".

Her work addresses social & environmental justice and aesthetic concerns through public art, graphic design, painting, printmaking & small press publishing. She graduated from Bennington College in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts in Visual Arts and began her career designing books at Random House before relocating to San Francisco in 1970.  Involvement with Haight Ashbury muralists  In the 1970s, Norling worked as a founding member with the Haight Ashbury muralists. Her work includes the 1976 mural “Our History is No Mystery” at John Adams Community College, as well as the 1984 mural “Darles Armas Y Tambien Ensenarles a Leer” (Give Them Arms and Also Teach Them to Read), initially painted as part of the Balmy Alley Mural Project. This mural, moved from its original location but still visible from the street, depicts the Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign, launched in 1980 by the Sandinista government, reduce illiteracy and is based in part on images in photographs by Margaret Randall. The former is well documented in the film Peoples Wall, produced by the Haight Ashbury Film Collective.  Peoples Press  In 1972, as a member of Peoples Press, who published the North American edition of Cuban international magazine “Tricontinental,\\" Norling travelled to Cuba to learn from and work with the OSPAAAL design department where she designed a poster applicable to the people of Puerto Rico; this poster was printed by OSPAAAL and has become one of her most recognized social justice designs. Norling is one of eight women who designed a combined 22 posters for OSPAAAL, out of the organization's total output of roughly 326 known posters. Peoples Press was a non-hierarchical collective where design, offset small-press printing, all aspects of running a small press shop were considered equal merit, with all collective members learning all skills. In this context, individuals evolved skill in several shop jobs while maintaining awareness of every part of the process. At Peoples Press, Norling collaborated with Gail Dolgin in 1978 on a celebrated poster for International Women's Day. The design on this poster was taken from one of Norling's murals, \\"Sistersongs of Liberation\\".  Graphic design  Norling has illustrated and designed logos and print materials that include California Department of Public Health worker safety projects, including pamphlets for the California Department of Industrial Relations and OLPPP. This includes the 1980 screenprint poster \\"La Leche Materna es la Mejor (Breast Milk is the Best)\\" for a Food & Nutrition Services campaign in Santa Cruz, California. This poster was reproduced by the Syracuse Cultural Workers in 1986, and was included in an exhibition on women's rights at Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Fall 2016.  Other cultural design  Norling designed cover art for the 1974 Red Star Singers album, The Force of Life, released by Paredon Records (now operated as Smithsonian Folkways Recordings), as well as a poster for San Francisco Mime Troupe plays including The Mother (1973), False Promises/Nos Engañaron (1976), Hotel Universe (1977), a play based on the International Hotel struggle, and Coast City Confidential (1995). Her political poster art was included in the 2003 exhibition One Struggle, Two Communities: Late 20th Century Political Posters of Havana, Cuba and the San Francisco Bay Area at the Berkeley Art Center. In 2011, her painting, \\"Absence,\\" was included in a travelling art exhibition which marked ten years of US war against Afghanistan. This painting depicts a group of Afghan women, including one holding an empty white figure meant to signify the child she has lost in war.  Paintings and public art installation  Norling's more recent work places greater focus on studio painting, specifically abstract landscapes inspired by visits to National Parks and other outdoor areas of expansive beauty. It has been included in exhibitions curated by Slate Contemporary Gallery in Oakland, CA, at Berkeley Art Center's 2013 unjuried member exhibition, Wonder, and the 2014 Feature exhibition. Her art has also been featured on the cover of Margaret Randall's 2009 publication, Their Backs to the Sea. Norling's work was commissed to be printed on glass for a major art installation at the Almeda County social services building at 1111 Jackson Street in Oakland, California; this installation was approved in October 2015, and features water-based imagery on glass on six separate sections within the building.

Design and development Construction of the first S-6 was started in August 1911. The three bay biplane was powered by an Argus 4-cylinder water-cooled engine producing . Initial flight tests in late November were disappointing, revealing a long take-off run and poor climb performance. Sikorsky disassembled the aircraft and took it home where substantial modifications were undertaken, including lengthening the wingspan and reducing aerodynamic drag by enclosing the fuselage with wood veneer. Ailerons on the lower wing were removed and strut bracing wires were arranged in pairs with wooden spacers between them, further reducing drag. S-6-B with larger wing and enclosed fuselage Sikorsky now called the machine the S-6-A and it exhibited remarkable improvement. During one flight with three men on board the aircraft registered a speed of , exceeding the world record at that time and in February 1912 the S-6-A earned the highest award at the 1912 Moscow Aviation Exhibition. In late spring 1912 Sikorsky began working at the Russian Baltic Railroad Car Works as chief engineer of the aircraft manufacturing division. Work was started on a refined version of the S-6-A called the S-6-B with strengthened landing gear and a mechanism to permit starting the engine from the cockpit. Completed in July, the S-6-B was entered in the international military competition at Saint Petersburg in August and flown by Sikorsky.

The 13-story building, constructed between 1892 and 1894, was designed by William H. Hume and built by Richard Deeves, with Frederick H. Kindl as chief structural engineer. The Mutual Reserve Building was designed in a variant of the Romanesque Revival style inspired by the work of Henry Hobson Richardson. The building's articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. The facade is clad with granite and limestone, and includes arcades on its lower and upper stories, piers made of rusticated stone blocks, and decorative foliate motifs. The structure was one of the first in New York City to use a cage-like steel frame structure, an early version of the skyscraper. The Mutual Reserve Building was originally named for its main tenant, the Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association, which occupied 305 Broadway until it went bankrupt in 1909. The first owner, the family of shipping magnate William Fletcher Weld, owned 305 Broadway until 1920. After the Mutual Reserve Association's bankruptcy, 305 Broadway was renamed the Langdon Building. Through the 20th century, the building's main tenants were in the publishing and paper industries, and it also served as the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission's first long-term headquarters from 1967 to 1980. The Mutual Reserve Building is one of several extant life- insurance buildings on the southernmost section of Broadway, and was designated a New York City landmark in 2011.  Site  The Mutual Reserve Building is in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, just west of the Civic Center. It has frontage along Broadway to the east and Duane Street to the south. Nearby buildings and locations include the David S. Brown Store to the northwest; 311 Broadway and 315 Broadway to the north; the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building to the east; and the Ted Weiss Federal Building and African Burial Ground National Monument to the southeast. The building spans the addresses 305–309 Broadway and 91–99 Duane Street. The lot measures , with the longer side being on Duane Street.  Design  The Mutual Reserve Building is 13 stories tall, with a roof height of . It was designed by William H. Hume in a variant of the Romanesque Revival style inspired by the work of Henry Hobson Richardson. Richard Deeves was also involved as the main builder, Frederick H. Kindl was the chief structural engineer, Carnegie Steel Company was the steel supplier, and Hanlein & Co. was the stone contractor. The design was inspired by that of R. H. Robertson's Lincoln Building at Union Square. Both structures used the Richardson Romanesque style, specifically multi-story round-arched arcades upon a stone facade. The design also had smaller cornices above the 6th, 8th, and 10th floors. = Facade = Lower stories The eastern and southern facades are clad in limestone and divided into three horizontal sections: a base and shaft of six stories each, as well as a one-story capital. Small cornices run above the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th floors. The northern and western facades are faced in plain brick, with window openings. The building is split vertically into four bays on Broadway and six on Duane Street. The lowest five stories contain round-arched arcades supported by rusticated stone piers. The arches are located on the Broadway facade, as well as the outermost bays along Duane Street. These bays contain two rectangular windows on each floor, both within and above the arches. The center bays on Duane Street contain three windows on each floor. The top story is also arranged as a small arcade with arched windows. The top story runs below a parapet with a balustrade. As built, the entrance on Broadway contained a large arch, but this was eliminated in 1923. = Features = The structure was one of the first early skyscrapers in New York City to use a cage-like steel frame structure. The Mutual Reserve Building utilized steel in its beams and columns, which were riveted to each other and supported each floor's walls. In a 1909 meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Carnegie Steel engineer C. V. Childs stated that he had devised a wind bracing system, utilizing gusset plates at the building's narrow end to reduce distortion, which was first used in either the Mutual Reserve Building or the Savoy-Plaza Hotel. The developers of the American Surety Building, another early skyscraper with a full steel skeleton completed in 1896, intended to model their project after the Mutual Reserve Building's design. The steel frame was encased in brick and asbestos cement. The building was described as being \\"absolutely fireproof\\", with brick partitions and floors. Inside, the staircases were made of iron and stone, and the hallways were finished in marble. When opened, the building contained a mail chute and an electric clock on every floor. As originally built, wood was only used for furniture, doors, and the casement windows. The basement housed the building's lighting, housing, and ventilation machinery, as well as an employee dining room and storage space. The 1st floor is reserved for retail space, and was placed at ground level, as opposed to earlier buildings that had a raised basement for their 1st-floor tenants. The first-floor vestibules were made of marble. The upper floors were mostly used as office space; the Mutual Reserve Association utilized three or four of the lowest office stories, while the other floors were rented to other tenants. Early advertisements also touted a barber shop, cigar stand, ticket office, and telegraph and telephone offices. Four Otis & Brother elevators were utilized in the Mutual Reserve Building when it opened. One of the building's elevators, running from the 1st through 5th floors, was used solely by Mutual Reserve's top-level executives until it was sealed in 1907. As in other early skyscrapers of the time, the elevator doors on each door could be opened regardless of where the elevator physically was. The building's elevators were involved in at least three deaths: a businessman in 1904, a delicatessen dealer in 1909, and a cleaner in 1926. History = Planning and construction = Depicted in King's Handbook of New York City (1893) William Fletcher Weld, who died in 1881, was described as one of the most successful merchant ship owners in the United States. He left a $21 million estate (equivalent to $ million in ), much of which went to his grandchildren William Fletcher Weld Jr., Charles Goddard Weld, Mary Bryant Pratt Sprague, and Isabel Weld Perkins. The Weld estate bought the northwest- corner lot at Broadway and Duane Street from the Hale estate in May 1888 for $350,000. At the time, the lot contained a three-story brick building with a restaurant on the ground floor and offices on the upper floors. Two years later, the estate acquired an interior lot adjacent to that property. In January 1892, the Real Estate Record and Guide reported that Hume had been contracted to design a building of at least 10 stories on the Weld estate's lot, which would be constructed for at least $600,000. The Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association was launched as a life insurance company in 1881 under the leadership of Edward Bascom Harper. Within eleven years, it had become the world's \\"purely mutual natural-premium\\" life insurance company. By the time the building was announced in January 1892, Mutual Reserve had agreed to lease space in the Weld estate's new building for its new headquarters. The lease would run 40 years from June 1, 1894, and was based on a percentage of the construction cost and the $500,000 land value. Mutual Reserve was recorded as having paid around $408,297 for the lease, as well as construction and furnishings. Hume filed plans for the Mutual Reserve Building in June 1892, by which it was planned as a 13-story structure. Work was delayed due to a strike at Carnegie Steel's factories. Construction was also held up by strikes at the granite supplier's factory. Mutual Reserve, in a January 1894 report, stated that the building would be completed by the next month. The ground-floor retail spaces had been leased for $30,000 annually, while the upper floors had been leased to several tenants for a combined $75,000 annually. On June 14, 1894, two hundred guests and Mutual Reserve employees attended dedication ceremonies on the building's roof. The building, officially completed in September, ultimately cost $1.2 million in total. = Use =  Late 19th and early 20th centuries  After the Mutual Reserve Building's completion. Mutual Reserve vacated its former quarters at the Potter Building on nearby Park Row. The company's presidential and cabinet offices were on the 4th floor, while the general offices were on the 2nd floor. The Arkwright Club, a merchants' clubhouse, leased space on the 13th floor for $60,000 annually between 1893 and 1895. In the first two decades of the Mutual Reserve Building's existence, it contained the offices of several tenants involved in the paper and publishing industry. Additional tenants included the Co- Operative Building Bank, the Spanish Benevolent Society of New York, the Mutual Mercantile Agency, the Miller Bros Cutlery Company, and a \\"National Organization of Brain Brokers\\" named Hapgoods. The building's contractor Richard Deeves & Son, as well as a bicycle showroom and architects, also took up space in the building. The Weld estate retained ownership of the building, although William Jr. died in 1893 and Charles and Isabel gave up their respective shares in 1901 and 1907. The Mutual Reserve Association experienced controversy in 1896 over allegations of financial mismanagement, and reorganized as the Mutual Reserve Life Insurance Company in 1902, although further scrutiny led to the company's vice-president and president being indicted in 1906. In the wake of this controversy, the building's private executives' elevator was closed in June 1907. Mutual Reserve renewed its lease at the Mutual Reserve Building in February 1908 for $60,000 annually, even though the company had just entered receivership. 305 Broadway had became known as the Langdon Building by 1909, when Hume filed plans for minor building modifications. The building was probably named after John Langdon Brandegee, a stock broker who was the son of the sole owner at the time, Mary Bryant Pratt Sprague. The Mutual Reserve Company had become bankrupt by 1911. During the mid-1910s, the ground floor space was taken by the Standard Lunch Company and Emerson Shoe Company.  Mid-20th century to present  In February 1920, the Broadway-John Street Corporation bought the Langdon Building from the Weld estate for about $2 million. The new owner planned to renovate the building for lawyers' use at a cost of $40,000 to $50,000, and planned to rename the structure as the Lawyers' Building. The purchase was due to the building's proximity to courthouses on Chambers Street and the lack of available space for lawyers in the Financial District. In 1923, architects Schwartz & Gross were hired to replace the large entrance arch on Broadway with a \\"squared-off\\" opening. The Mutual Reserve Building was not highly regarded in the legal sector, being described as \\"a law office slum\\" and a 1920s hub of the \\"personal injury underworld\\". Other tenants during that time included metal supplier Herman J. Heght Inc.; the Amalgamated Lithographers of America; architecture firm Marcus Contracting Company; architect George F. Hardy; and a temporary location of the Wall Street Synagogue. The building was sold in 1940 to the Downtown Renting Company, and it was refinanced for $300,000. At the time, 305 Broadway was entirely rented, with most of the tenants being lawyers. Five years later, the building was sold to Broaduane Corporation. The Jewish Forum Association, which published a journal called the Jewish Forum, operated in the building in the 1940s. During the next decade, many agencies of the New York state government started moving in. The 305 Broadway Company, headed by Sylvan Lawrence and Seymour Cohn, bought the building in 1957. Two years later, 305 Broadway was sold again to Joseph and Louis Lefkowitz of Broadway Duane Associates, who leased the building back to the previous owners. After purchase, Louis Lefkowitz changed the name of 305 Broadway from the Broadway Duane Building to the Lawyers Equity Building. Through the 1960s, the city government's departments of Real Estate and Relocation also occupied space in 305 Broadway. The building also served as the first permanent headquarters of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) from 1967 to 1980. The building's leasehold was given to 305 Broadway Corporation, headed by Louis Lefkowitz, in 1969. The leasehold and property fee were united in 1975 under the 305 Broadway Company. In 1980, Herman Abbott bought the then-vacant building, intending to upgrade it to offices. Reade Broadway Associates bought the building two years later. The LPC scheduled hearings in 1989 for the possibility of conferring city landmark designation upon 305 Broadway. The building officially became a city landmark in 2011. It is one of several remaining life-insurance company headquarters on the southernmost section of Broadway, along with the Former New York Life Insurance Company Building and the Home Life Building.  Critical reception  Moses King, in his 1893 edition of King’s Handbook of New York, referred to 305 Broadway as \\"one of the finest office buildings in the city\\", describing the building as \\"a masterpiece of architecture\\". The same year, the New-York Tribune wrote that the Mutual Reserve Building's design \\"has aroused the admiration of all who have seen it.\\" The building's fireproof features were inspected in a 1895 visit led by William Hume and managing director G. H. Wooster, leading The New York Times to state that \\"Modern scientific construction can go no further\\".

Early life and education Low-Beer's early career was as a painter. She studied painting under Alex Colville at Mount Allison University, completing her BFA in 1965. This was followed by an MFA at Cranbrook, which she completed in 1967. While living in California from 1968-1971, she began to experiment with clay sculpture. In 1980, Low-Beer moved to Toronto and began to focus on large figurative works in clay. Career Low-Beer has created several notable bodies of work. Still Dances, created in 1991, combines several historical references to female forms, including Greek Cycladic sculpture and Romanesque figures, in a series of nine clay sculptures. Mutable Selves, is a series of eight clay and steel sculptures created from 1994-1995. In 2001, Low-Beer exhibited Rocksbreath, a series of 30 press-moulded figures installed in the Burlington Art Centre courtyard, in a show curated by Jonathan Smith. Two of the figures were subsequently shown in a 2013 retrospective at the Gardiner Museum. This was followed by Tools for Daily Living (2003), a series of paper hangings incorporating clay figures reflecting her Rocksbreath work. In 2012 she facilitated psychotheraputic workshops for women survivours of violence in partnership between the Schilfer Clinic and the Gardiner Museum. Her subsequent work, About Face, consisted of 24 ceramic heads mounted on pedestals. It was displayed along with the work of the participants in Transformation by Fire, a 2013 exhibition at the Gardiner. Critical reviews of Low-Beer's work have been positive throughout her career, but biases against ceramic-based work, often considered a craft material, have affected her inclusion in discussions of fine art practices. Low-Beer has taught privately from her studio, and at institutions including the Art Gallery of Ontario and Sheridan College.

Her appearances on American talk-shows such as Johnny Carson's and Joan Rivers', as well as her successful restaurants, were instrumental in her popularization and education efforts.  Early life  Kuo was born in 1919 into a family of affluent Chinese literati intimately linked to the Qing dynasty government of China. Her uncle Yuan Li-jun was the tutor of Puyi, the last Emperor of China. She grew up exposed to the finest offerings of Chinese cuisine and showed keen interest in learning about food. She befriended the hired cooks in her household and was taught the techniques of preparing some of their more opulent dishes. Her family's influence and affluence at the time also allowed her to travel extensively throughout China, experiencing everything from the heavy meat-based dishes of North China to the fine vegetarian cuisine at family Buddhist retreats.  Adulthood  Kuo went to Barnard College in the United States for her undergraduate degree and returned to China upon graduation. Because of the ongoing civil war in China between Chiang Kai- shek's Nationalists and Mao Zedong's Communists, however, she returned to the United States just after her 22nd birthday. She met her future husband, Chi- Chih Kuo, a general under Chiang Kai-shek, in Washington, D.C. in 1943 and was married the following year. The couple had two sons and, after traveling between her husband's posts in Washington and Italy, they eventually settled in New York City. It was here that they opened their two highly successful restaurants: * Lichee Tree, opened in 1960 on East 8th Street in Greenwich Village. * Gingko Tree, opened in 1966 on the corner of 69th Street and Amsterdam near Lincoln Center. The Kuo residences were several floors above each restaurant. Through publicity events such as holding Barbra Streisand's 20th birthday bash at the Lichee Tree in 1962, commissioning composer Dick Hyman to lead an orchestra accompanied with Chinese cleavers for the Year of the Monkey, and being in the public spotlight in radio, television, and newspapers throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Kuos became relatively well known in American culture of the time. The Lichee Tree had well-known Chinese New Year celebrations, frequented by famous patrons such as Rocky Marciano, who offered to “fight anybody in the house.” Throughout the 1960s, she also taught classes at the China Institute in New York. = The Key to Chinese Cooking = In 1971 Kuo pitched the idea of a Chinese cookbook to Judith Jones, who knew of her through her appearance and mention in the media of the time. Jones was impressed by Kuo's extensive knowledge of the cuisine, her articulate prose, and by the sincerity of her voice. Together with copy editor Suzi Arensberg and the illustrator Carolyn Moy, Jones and Kuo worked for more than five years on the manuscript, polishing it to make the concepts and organization understandable for the intended Western audience. It was also written in a way to provide a cultural glimpse into the Chinese psyche as well as being a guide and recipe book for Chinese cuisine. The Chinese seals in the book were designed by Kuo's husband. The book was eventually published in 1977. Kuo's intention in writing and working on the book was \\"to leave something permanent\\". Indeed, the cookbook was successful enough to go through several printings, and it became the standard resource for Chinese cuisine in North America and abroad for the decade to come. It continues to influence food and cookbook writers such as Barbara Tropp, Eileen Yin-Fei Lo, Fuchsia Dunlop, Anne Mendelson, and Grace Young.  Later life  Following the sale of her restaurants and the completion of her cookbook, Kuo retreated from public life and moved to Glendale, California. It had been her intention to publish a follow-up to The Key to Chinese Cooking with 175 recipes; Kuo indicated to Jones on January 2, 1982 that it could be finished within a year. The book was never completed, however, and Kuo eventually cut off contact with Jones for unknown reasons. Kuo was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in early 1993 and died later in July 1993, weeks after her husband's death.

It is the fifth novel in the Queen's Thief series that Turner began with The Thief in 1996. Setting The novel is set in the fictional Mede Empire, a large domain that plots to swallow up the nearby countries of Attolia and Sounis. Background The novel was originally intended to be part of The King of Attolia. However, Turner decided it would be too long and wrote it as a separate book. According to Turner, Thick as Thieves was inspired by The Eagle of the Ninth by Rosemary Sutcliff. Unlike in the original novel, Turner wanted to have the story told from the perspective of the slave character. Plot summary The book picks up after the events of The Queen of Attolia when the Medes failed to establish the Queen of Attolia as a puppet ruler. Nahuseresh, the Medean ambassador to Attolia, and his slave Kamet were forced to flee the country after the botched invasion. Due to his failure in Attolia, Nahuseresh has fallen out of favor with his powerful brother, the heir to the Medean throne. As the secretary and slave to Nahuseresh, Kamet has the ambition and means of becoming one of the most powerful people in the Empire. However, after angering his master, Kamet is offered a risky opportunity escape slavery by a mysterious foreigner claiming he was sent by the King of Attolia. Kamet is reluctant to leave his prestigious position as head secretary to Nahuseresh, but when his fellow slave Laela warns him that their master has been poisoned, he believes left with little choice if he wants to live.

He is currently the team principal of the Haas Formula One Team, and previously managing director of Jaguar Racing and technical operations director of its subsequent incarnation, Red Bull Racing. Career = Rally (1986–2001)= Born in Merano, South Tyrol, the son of a butcher, Steiner studied engineering without finishing, and moved to Belgium after his military service, where he started his career as a mechanic in the World Rally Championship for Mazda Rally Team Europe from 1986–1988. From January 1989 to 1990, Steiner worked as assistant team manager for Top Run Srl. He acted as head of reconnaissance, and later technical manager, at Jolly Club from 1991–1996. In 1997, Steiner managed Prodrive's Allstar Rally team, winning the European Rally Championship with Krzysztof Hołowczyc, and in 1998 M-Sport recruited him as project manager. He was promoted to director of engineering in 2000, where he worked under the Ford World Rally Team alongside drivers Colin McRae and Carlos Sainz to secure consecutive runner-up finishes in the 2000 and 2001 seasons. =Jaguar (2001–2003)= Steiner switched to Formula One in 2001 when Jaguar Racing's newly-appointed team principal, Niki Lauda, headhunted him for the job of managing director. According to Steiner, \\"[Lauda] asked, 'are there any talented people at Ford?' And the reply was 'there's Günther.' The guy lied!\\" Assuming the role on 3 December, Steiner was responsible for the engineering side of the team at Milton Keynes, while director of strategy John Allison handled administrative tasks. Steiner reorganised the team and reduced costs during his tenure. However, Jaguar underperformed in the 2002 season, with lead driver Eddie Irvine claiming only eight championship points while teammate Pedro de la Rosa failed to score, and parent company Ford dismissed Lauda on 26 November before making 70 team members redundant. On 5 December, Jaguar announced Steiner had been replaced by project manager David Pitchforth as part of the restructuring. Spokesman Nav Sidhu said, \\"he has relinquished his responsibilities as MD but has done nothing wrong. This organisation is in significantly better shape now than when he joined. Günther has clearly laid down the engineering baseline that David will now aim to take on to the next level.\\" Although Jaguar's new management offered Steiner another role in the team, he ultimately declined, and spent the 2003 season on garden leave before replacing Wiet Huidekoper as technical director at Opel Performance Center in November of that year. =Red Bull (2005–2008)= After Red Bull purchased Jaguar Racing in November 2004, Steiner was invited to join Red Bull Racing. Opel's plans to withdraw from the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters at the end of 2005 motivated his return to the Milton Keynes team. His appointment as technical operations director was confirmed on 13 January 2005. Steiner and team principal Christian Horner jointly led the outfit to improved results in the 2005 season, but when Red Bull poached championship-winning technical director Adrian Newey from McLaren, team owner Dietrich Mateschitz approached Steiner to help establish a NASCAR team in the United States. Feeling the F1 team had become overcrowded, Steiner consulted his wife and agreed to move to Mooresville, North Carolina, where he served as Team Red Bull's technical director from 1 April 2006 to April 2008. =Haas (2014–)= Steiner remained in Mooresville after leaving Red Bull, where he founded manufacturing company Fibreworks Composites in January 2009. While the US F1 Team was in development, Steiner met Joe Custer and Gene Haas of Stewart-Haas Racing, who had declined to invest in the project, at a steakhouse. He proposed they themselves enter F1 by ordering a customer car from an established constructor, but delays in securing approval prompted them to apply for entry as a privateer team. Steiner, described as \\"the prime 'doer'\\" by motorsport publication Autosport, recruited the core staff, interviewed every team member, and developed partnerships with outsourcers Dallara and Ferrari. On 14 April 2014, he was officially announced team principal of the fledgling Haas F1 Team. With their entry in the 2016 season, Haas became the first American constructor to compete in F1 in 30 years. The team took eight points at the 2016 Australian Grand Prix with a 6th place finish by driver Romain Grosjean, becoming the first American entry, and the first constructor overall since Toyota Racing in 2002, to score in their debut race. Haas completed the season with an 8th place finish in the 2016 constructor standings and 29 points, all scored by Grosjean. Personal life Steiner holds Italian and American passports, and lives in Mooresville, North Carolina with his wife, Gertraud, and daughter, Greta.

Education  Weatherbie was born in 1909 in Vancouver and went to Britannia Secondary School. Weatherbie attended the Vancouver School of Decorative Applied Art, now Emily Carr University of Art and Design, from 1925 to 1929 with fellow painter and friend Irene Hoffar Reid. Weatherbie continued her education in 1932-1933 completing post-graduate studies at the Royal Academy of Arts in London where she expanded her skill in diffused light, muted color, and fractured surfaces. Upon her return from London,Weatherbie took a position as a painting instructor at the British Columbia College of Arts in Vancouver. The school was founded by Frederick Varley, W.G. Macdonald and Harry Täuberwas. Weatherbie worked at the British Columbia College of Arts until it closed due to financial troubles in 1935.  Impact on Artists  Weatherbie was well known both as a model and muse for such artists as Frederick Varley and her spouse Harold Mortimer Lamb. Varley created a number of portraits of Weatherbie with one of his most celebrated paintings titled Vera (1931) becoming a part of the Masterpieces of Canadian art series postage stamps issued by Canada Post on May 6, 1994. While a student of Frederick Varley at the School of Decorative and Applied Arts in Vancouver, Weatherbie was known for having taught Varley about auras. Harry Adaskan, a Canadian violinist and author, noted, \\"'Vera, who was involved in mystical speculation, taught Varley about auras: vibrations which surround all people revealing the true state of their emotions and spirit. These vibrations were depicted as colour by those spiritually ready to receive them.\\"  Reception  Although Weatherbie has been considered underrated for her time, she did receive recognition for some of her work through awards and reception. Weatherbie was applauded for Portrait of F.H. Varley (1930, oil on canvas and board, 99.0 cm x 85.0 cm) for her ability to capture her subject. Blodwin Davies of the Toronto Star Weekly on January 21, 1931 stated, \\"Miss Weatherbie has attempted to paint not only a keenly discerning study of the face of the artist, but she has invaded the world of metaphysics in a daring effort to commit to paint the immaterial qualities of personality.\\"  Personal life  Weatherbie married Canadian artist Harold Mortimer Lamb on May 4, 1942.

The Prime Minister of Rwanda Paul Kagame ordered to publish the law in the official gazette on 11 March 2013, officially making the country the 11th country in Africa and 94th country globally to adopt an Access to Information law. The Rwanda AIL provides a comprehensive framework for access to information in Rwanda. The purpose of the law, as declared in Article 1, is to “enable the public and journalists to access information possessed by public organs and some private bodies.” The legislative project has been praised by Article 19, a British human rights organisation as one of the best access to information laws both in Africa and globally, and recognised by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative as “a signal of government’s intention to entrench transparency and enhance public participation in governance.”  Main features  Rwandan access to information law goes to broaden the scope of the organs to which the law applies. Under Article 13, all private organs “whose activities are in connection with public interest, human rights and freedoms” have to comply with the Law. Article 15 then requires all private organs to appoint an information officer to deal with information requests from persons. Finally, Article 14 provides for a way for persons to access information in a private organ to which this Law does not apply. Chapter IV, which deals with compliance with the Law by private organs, has been subject to some criticism. Article 19 has stated that the definition of a private body, provided in Article 2, is inconsistent with the above provisions in the Chapter IV. An inclusion of a provision for improvement of the protection of whistleblowers has been labelled as progressive by the international community. Article 16 includes a prohibition to punish any person, who has disclosed information in the public interest. Chapter III defines the procedures for accessing information. Any individual or a group of persons can apply for information with no fees required, except some postage and paper charges. The time for the provision of information is not provided in the Law, and is given to the liberty of a Ministerial Order. The request for information can be laid down in any of the constitutionally acknowledged languages and done by writing, verbally, telephone, internet or any other means of communication. The Rwandan access to information law also provides for a broad list of exemptions where access to information can be restricted to material of “public interest.” Article 4 of the Rwandan AIL foresees that information is confidential when it may: * destabilise national security; * impede the enforcement of Law or justice; * involve interference in the privy of an individual when it is not of public interest; * violate the legitimate protection of trade secrets or other intellectual property rights protected by the Law; * obstruct actual or contemplated legal proceedings against the management of public organ.  Significance of the Rwanda access to information act  The Rwandan ACI is said to help promote transparency and more budgetary accountability within the country. The right to access of information is associated with democratic values within the country. Furthermore, the Law is expected to help journalists keep the public better informed, citizens gain more knowledge on their rights and students to conduct better research.

Origin  The march was inspired by the return of Manuel Baquedano to the city of Valparaiso in 1881 during the War of the Pacific. The lyrics were composed by Jorge Inostroza and the music was created by Willy Bascuñán, a member of Los Cuatro Cuartos. The song was included in the album ¡Al 7° de Línea! by Los Cuatro Cuartos which was released in 1966 and was acclaimed by both the public and critics, reaching the top of the music charts in Chile. \\"Los viejos estandartes\\" was used alongside the \\"Himno de Yungay\\" in official ceremonies from 1967 onward, becoming part of the official repertoire of songs played by military and civil marching bands on national holidays.

Joe Hayes was born in Bakersfield, Missouri to Norman \\"Darby\\" and Dicy Hayes. His uncle, Herman Cotter, worked throughout the Territory of Alaska during World War II and convinced the Hayes family to accompany him and his family in their move to Alaska. Making the trip in June 1946, they were among the very first civilians to travel the Alaska Highway. The Hayes family settled in Anchorage, where he graduated from Anchorage High School the following year. Hayes received his bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Washington in 1951, and his master's degree from the University of Alaska in 1966. Hayes was a surveyor and civil engineer. He was a partner in the engineering firm Tryck, Nyman and Hayes in Anchorage, which has been one of Alaska's leading engineering firms since the late 20th century. Hayes served as chair of the Anchorage Platting Commission from 1959 to 1964. From 1977 to 1984, Hayes served in the Alaska House of Representatives as a Republican representing west Anchorage. In 1981 and 1983, Hayes served as speaker of the house, gaining the office as a result of a leadership coup in which dissident Democrats formed a coalition with members of all three parties (which included two Libertarians), deposing the Democratic House leadership and incumbent speaker Jim Duncan.'American Legislative Leaders in the West, 1911-1994,' Nancy Weatherly Sharp, James Roger Sharp-editors, Greenwood Press, Westport, Connecticut and London: 1997, Biographical Sketch of Joseph L. Hayes, pg. 135Alaska Legislature-Joe L. Hayes Hayes ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Anchorage in 1981. Hayes ran for governor in the 1986 primary election. He spent nearly a million dollars of his own money but fared little well in the crowded field, gaining 5.3 percent of the vote among fourteen candidates in the blanket primary and coming in a distant fourth among Republicans, behind Arliss Sturgulewski, Wally Hickel and Dick Randolph. After leaving elected office, Hayes became a lobbyist. At the turn of the 21st century, he was Alaska's top legislative lobbyist, earning nearly ten percent of the total revenue spent on lobbying in Alaska by himself. After retiring, he bought an estate in Missouri and returned there to live. He reunited with his cousin in June 2016 in Anchorage to recall his trip up the Alaska Highway; the two were the only surviving members of that party. A Lutheran, Hayes married Patricia and they had three daughters.

It did not reach production. Design and development Yves Le Prieur had identified a need for a simple, economical training aircraft on which pupils could master the behaviour of seaplanes and approached the designer and constructer Louis Peyret for a suitable aircraft. The outcome was the Peyret-Le Prieur seaplane. It was a single bay biplane, with rectangular plan wings mounted without stagger and braced by two pairs of parallel, vertical interplane struts and bracing wires, with a large interplane gap of . The wings were wooden, two-spar, two-part structures, with spruce leading edges. Broad, full-span ailerons on upper and lower wings were externally connected. The seaplane had a rectangular section fuselage, built around four longerons and plywood covered. It was widest under the wing leading edge, where on each side a vertical cabane strut joined the upper longeron to the forward spar, and where pupil and tutor sat side-by-side in an open cockpit. The short nose ahead of them remained wide and the engine, unusually, was mounted off-set to port. Initially a four-cylinder inline Sergant A was used, its radiator mounted midway up the portside cabane strut. At the rear the large area empennage was conventional, with a large span, rectangular plan all-moving tail mounted on top of the fuselage. Its triangular fin carried a roughly rhomboidal rudder which reached down to the keel through an elevator cut-out. The seaplane had simple, rectangular cross- section floats. The flat undersides curved up towards the nose, reaching just beyond the propeller and the aft ends were under the ailerons. There was no step. Each float was attached with four aluminium tube struts, two leaning inwards to the lower fuselage longeron and two outwards to the wing spars. They were constructed of wood, with ash frames and mahogany plywood covering. The tail was protected with a cylindrical float of the same construction, attached longitudinally under the fin. Fitted with the Sergant engine, the seaplane began tests on Lake Annecy in the summer of 1924 but it was unable to reach water speeds fast enough to unstick. In response a Anzani 6 radial engine was substituted, again mounted off-set. With this, the seaplane left the water easily on its first flight on 24 August 1924. Further tests showed that about was required for take-off, though once in the air, was enough. By mid-September nineteen flights had been made, some lasting about 30 minutes, and a passenger had been carried. The seaplane then returned to Paris, where it was fitted with a wheeled undercarriage for further tests, though by January 1925 it was flying from water again, at Pecq. By September 1924 the aircraft was judged a success and a second was under construction. Le Prieur had plans for a floatplane flying school at Annecy. It is not known if the second machine was completed or the school set up.

Her work has been recognized by Human Rights Watch in Toronto with the receipt of the Alison Des Forges Award in 2011 and the Yayasan Pusat Studi Hak Asasi Manusia with the Yap Thiam Hien Award for human rights in 2014. Early life Anis Hidayah was born on 7 November 1976 in a small village in the Bojonegoro Regency of East Java, in Indonesia. As a child, she became aware of how many members of her community had migrated abroad in search of work, leaving their children in care of grandparents. She enrolled in law school and attended Jember University in the Jember Regency and became involved in the Indonesian Islamic Students Movement (). In 1998, Hidayah learned of the rape of a migrant woman and her lack of recourse. The victim left her job, but her attacker neither had to pay her wages for her broken contract nor did he face any criminal charges. When the victim returned to Indonesia, there was no rehabilitation or assistance for her either, which inspired Hidayah to complete her bachelor's thesis on the plight of migrant workers. Of the seven million migrant Indonesian workers employed in places like Kuwait, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, six million are women. Most are employed in domestic service or as nannies. Signing a two-year contract for services, once they leave the country, there are few laws that protect them and no monitoring by the Indonesian government of them or their working conditions. Hidayah joined the East Java Women's Solidarity organization in 1999 and worked with them for a year and a half before beginning her graduate studies. The organization was at the time, the only organization dealing with migrant issues. Hidayah did not complete her graduate degree, because of her involvement in founding Migrant Care. Career In 2004, Hidayah co-founded an NGO, \\"Migrant Care\\" to advocate for immigrant Indonesians working abroad. The NGO pressed lawmakers to draft reforms to protect migrant laborers and provides legal services for women who have experienced violence or abuse, including situations which place them in debt servitude. They also maintain a database and establish service centers in areas with high migrant exodus to educate people about the pitfalls, their rights and have a system to track workers and help their families. Through protests, lobbying efforts with lawmakers and utilizing media to drive reform, Hidayah has become one of the most visible activists for Indonesia’s migrant workers. In 2012, Indonesian Parliament ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, making a start to address the problem. Hidayah believes that enough hasn't been done. Authorities are slow to act when abuse occurs. In the run-up to the 2014 elections, it was promised that policies would control trafficking agencies, reform worker protections and improve to legal aid for migrant workers. Hidayah argued that allowing the death penalty to be carried out in Indonesia, directly impacted the ability to negotiate for release of Indonesian workers abroad. Her concerns were substantiated when two domestic workers in Saudi Arabia were executed without prior notice. In response in 2015, the government announced plans to place a ban on migrant workers. Hidayah spoke against the plan, arguing that discrimination against migrants, which restricted worker's rights would not solve the problems they face. Instead, she urged the government enact laws which required reasonable working and living conditions for workers, restricted their mistreatment and gave them opportunities to improve their economic conditions. In 2016, Hidayah urged lawmakers to create regulations that would eliminate recruitment fees and would require true employment conditions to be disclosed to workers.  Awards and recognition  In 2011, Hidayah received the Alison Des Forges Award from Human Rights Watch in Toronto for her advocacy on behalf of women and migrant workers.

She is the current Professor of Health and Social Science at the University of Edinburgh Medical School's Usher Institute and a member of the Chief Scientist Office's Health Improvement Committee. Research Having studied Social Anthropology at the University of Cambridge's Department of Social Anthropology, Lawton specialises in qualitative research in the fields of medical sociology and the sociology of health and illness. Lawton has contributed significantly to the understanding of a number of health related fields including medication adherence, diabetes, obesity and sexual and reproductive health. For a number of years she served as a lead editor on the journal Sociology of Health and Illness and has authored over 80 publications in books and peer-reviewed journals. Key publications Lawton's first book, titled The Dying Process: Patient Experiences of Palliative Care took an ethnographic look at dying within a hospice setting in modern day Britain. The book has been described as 'lifting the lid' on the challenging ethical practices of palliative care and despite proving controversial at the time of release remains a definitive text in this field. Lawton has conducted a considerable amount of research into the lived illness experiences and management of health conditions, including much research in the field of diabetes. Within this field Lawton has contributed to our understanding of the barriers to effective diabetes (self-)management and the benefits of tailored health education programmes.
