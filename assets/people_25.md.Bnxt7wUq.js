U.S. News & World Report's 2012 and 2013 rankings rated Yale first in the United States for its Masters of Fine Arts programs. The Yale Daily News reported in February 2007 that 1,215 applicants for its class of 2009 sought admission to 55 places. The Yale Alumni Magazine reported in November 2008 that the School admitted sixty-five applicants from among 1,142 for its class of 2010, and that fifty-six enrolled. Any student applying to the school must have an exceptional undergraduate record as well as a complete body of work for presentation. This is further followed by an essay and recommendations. The complete process for an applicant requires great preparation and the process must be completed in accordance with strict guidelines established by the school. Yale University School of Art website History The study of the visual arts at Yale began with the opening of the Trumbull Gallery in 1832. The Gallery was founded by portrait artist Colonel John Trumbull with the help of Professor Benjamin Silliman, a prominent chemist.Yale School of Art: \\"History.\\" Retrieved April 10, 2007. In 1864, Augustus Russell Street donated funds for the establishment of a School of Fine Arts at Yale. In his bequest, Street stipulated that it be ‚Äúa school for practical instruction, open to both sexes, for such as propose to follow art as a profession.‚Äù The program was placed under an art council, one of whose members was the painter-inventor Samuel F. B. Morse, a graduate of Yale College. Yale alumnus Andrew Dickson White was petitioned by the school's faculty to become the first dean, but instead opted to be the first president of Cornell University. A new building for the school, Street Hall, was completed in 1866. John Ferguson Weir, an artist, was the first director, and later a dean, of the Yale School of Fine Arts. He played a leading role in determining the initial curriculum at the school. While he did not attend a college or university, he studied under his father, Robert W. Weir, professor of art at the US Military Academy in West Point. As Weir began work on curriculum development at Yale he sought some guidance from his younger brother, Julian Alden Weir, who was studying art in Paris. This additional information is taken from John Ferguson Weir's Wikipedia Biography Entry. Please refer to it for more detail. Students taking a drawing course in Street Hall circa 1905 When the School of Fine Arts opened to students in 1869, it was the first of its kind affiliated with a tertiary institution in America. A three-year course in drawing, painting, sculpture, and art history was inaugurated. Two women‚ÄîAlice and Susan Silliman, both daughters of Benjamin Silliman, Jr.‚Äîenrolled in the first cohort of three students, and the School of Fine Arts became the first of Yale's schools to allow co-educational instruction. For the next four decades, more than three-quarters of its students were women. Early on, the three-year program yielded a certificate of completion. A degree program was created in 1891 with the authorization of a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree by the university's governing body. Several other arts disciplines were grafted to the School of Fine Arts and later budded as independent schools. Architectural instruction was begun in 1908 and was established as a department in 1916 with Everett Victor Meeks at its head. The architecture program quickly became dominant, especially under painter Eugene Savage's efforts to reframe painting and sculpture as \\"architectural arts\\" in the 1920s. Drama, under the direction of George Pierce Baker and with its own separate building, was added in 1925 and continued to function as a department of the School until it became an independent school in 1955. The department of graphic design (initially called graphic arts) was begun in 1951 under the direction of Alvin Eisenman. It was the first graduate program in graphic design in the United States. Joseph Albers came to the school in the same decade, and under his chairmanship the Departments of Painting and Sculpture were renamed the \\"Department of Design.\\" In 1959 the School of Art and Architecture was made a fully graduate professional school. Four years later the Art and Architecture Building was opened to much controversy. Designed by Paul Rudolph, its brutalist style was poorly received at the time of completion. In 1972, the School of Art and the School of Architecture, were split. They continued to share the Art and Architecture building until 2000. In 2000, the art school moved into a newly renovated building around the corner from Rudolph Building called Holcombe T. Green, Jr., Hall. Designed partially by Louis Kahn, the building had been built as the New Haven Jewish Community Center; its renovations were designed by architect Deborah Berke. Green Hall houses BFA and MFA students in photography and graphic design. The painting MFAs have their own building behind Green Hall; sculpture MFAs, who used to be in Hammond Hall across campus (since demolished), are now in a new sculpture building at 36 Edgewood, designed by Kiernan Timberlake and Associates. Study The degree of Master of Fine Arts is the only degree offered by the School of Art. It is conferred upon recommendation of the faculty after successful completion of all course work in residence and after a faculty-approved thesis presentation. The minimum residence requirement is two years. All candidates‚Äô work is reviewed by faculty at the end of each term. Yale College, the undergraduate division of Yale University, offers a Bachelor of Arts degree program with a major in Art. Undergraduate applicants wishing to major in Art at Yale must apply to Yale College directly. The program in art offers courses that, through work in a variety of media, provide an experience in the visual arts as part of a liberal education as well as preparation for graduate study and professional work. Courses at the 100 level stress the fundamental aspects of visual formulation and articulation. Courses numbered 200 through 499 offer increasingly intensive study leading to greater specialization in one or more of the visual disciplines such as graphic design, painting/printmaking, photography, and sculpture. The prerequisites for acceptance into the major are a Sophomore Review, which is an evaluation of work from studio courses taken at Yale School of Art, and five terms of introductory (100-level) courses. Four must be completed at the time of the Sophomore Review. Visual Thinking (Art 111a or b) and Basic Drawing (Art 114a or b) are mandatory. In exceptional cases, arrangements for a special review during the junior year may be made with the director of undergraduate studies in art. For graduation as an art major, a total of fourteen 14 course credits in the major field is required. These fourteen course credits must include the following: (1) five prerequisite courses at the 100 level (including Visual Thinking and Basic Drawing); (2) five 200-level and above courses; (3) the Junior Major Seminar (Art 395a) or Critical Theory in the Studio (Art 201b); (4) the Senior Project (Art 495b); and (5) two courses in the History of Art. Suggested program guidelines and specific requirements for the various areas of concentration are available from the director of undergraduate studies. A suggested program guideline is as follows: Freshman year Studio courses, two terms Sophomore year Studio courses, three terms Art history, one term Junior year Studio courses, three terms including the Junior Major Seminar Art history, one term Senior year Studio courses, four terms including the Senior Project. The School of Art offers professional instruction in four interrelated areas of study: graphic design, painting/printmaking, photography, and sculpture. The graduate student‚Äôs primary educational experience is centered on studio activity. Supporting this are structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, and the relativity of color.  Rankings  U.S. News & World Report ranks Yale School of Art as number one in Fine Arts. For specialties, it's ranked first in Painting and Photography, and second for Sculpture and Design.

This institution was established with the sole objective of promoting Kannada culture and language in times when the Kannada speaking regions of present day Karnataka were split into six different areas, where Kannada was often overshadowed by other languages. Soon the Sangha morphed into a hub for the Karnataka Ekikarana (Unification) movement and played a pivotal role in the eventual unification of Karnataka. It inspired the establishment of several institutions and organisations across the state. For its invaluable services and contributions to Kannada and Karnataka, this institution was awarded the Ekikarana Award by the Government of Karnataka on the occasion of the 50th year celebrations of Karnataka state in 2006.Vidyavardhak Sangha remembers founders The Times of India, 22 Jul 2010.  History  After the downfall of the Vijayanagara Empire, through the period of British rule, Karnataka was divided into six parts, namely Bombay Karnataka, Hyderabad Karnataka, Madras Karnataka, Coorg, Mysore and smaller princely states like Mudhol, Jamkhandi, Savanur etc. The result was that the Kannada culture and language in these areas were eclipsed by other cultures. For example, in the four districts of Dharwad, Belgaum, North Kanara and Bijapur districts that comprised Bombay Karnataka, Kannada culture and language had suffered severe setbacks due to prolonged Maratha rule. When the British introduced their system of education in this area, they were under the impression that these districts were part of Maharashtra and started Marathi schools there. Mr. Walter Elliott, Deputy Collector of Dharwad, soon found that the language of the people was Kannada, but Marathi was imposed upon them. Out of sympathy for the Kannada people and his knowledge of Kannada, Elliot started Kannada schools in Dharwad around 1830. Balashastri Jambhekar, an education officer of the Bombay Government, also felt that the since the language of the people was Kannada, there should be Kannada schools in these four districts. A determined effort to establish Kannada schools was made by Mr. W. A. Russell, who after serving as Professor in the Deccan College at Pune, was appointed as Educational Inspector of the Southern Division of the Bombay Province. To Russell's amazement, he found that there were not a sufficient number of persons who could teach Kannada effectively. He induced officers in other departments of the Bombay Government who were Kannadigas and who knew Kannada sufficiently to join the Education Department. Among them were Deputy Chennabasappa, Gangadhara Madivaleshwara Turumari, Srinivas Rodda, Bhujangarao Huilgol, Venkatarangu Katti and others. When Mr. R. H. Deshpande who was studying in the Deccan college passed his M.A. examination with a gold medal in 1884, Russell persuaded him to join the Education department and assured him that he would, with his stellar academic career, soon replace him as the Inspector of the Southern Division. True to his word, Russell promoted Mr. Deshpande as deputy inspector of Karwar within a few months of his joining Sardar High School in Belgaum. However, Mr. Russell was subsequently shifted from his post and in his place a Marathi officer was posted. For the next 25 years, three Marathi officers ruled over the Bombay Karnataka area and introduced Marathi in the Kannada schools. Mr. Deshpande naturally resented this and decided to revolt against this foisting of Marathi on Kannada children, but as a Government servant, there were restrictions on what he could do. He took shelter under the British policy of encouraging education in the vernacular language and decided to establish a Sangha for the protection of Kannada and the Unification of the Karnataka areas. Thus the Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha came into being on 20 July 1890.  Charter of the Sangha  The first charter of the new body was to publish books in Kannada. Kannada could live and thrive only through books and journals so the Sangha brought out its first publication two years after it was established and then came the first Kannada literary and cultural journal Vagabhushana. Since Kannada was the mother tongue of the rulers of Mysore, Mr. Deshpande enlisted the support of the Maharaja of Mysore, Shri Chamaraja Wodeyar for the Sangha. The Government of Mysore used to send its scholars to conduct Kannada exams which the Sangha used to hold periodically. It also gave money for the construction of a building for the Sangha which was appropriately named as Chamaraja Mandira. The Sangha organized the first conference of Kannada writers in Dharwad in 1905. This was the precursor of the present-day Kannada Sahitya Sammelan (annual literary conference). In 1912, when Sir Mokshagundam Vishweshwaraiah became the Diwan of Mysore, Mr. R. H. Deshpande who knew him intimately, wrote him a letter congratulating him on his appointment and further requested him to foster more attention on the development of the Kannada language and culture. As a result, Mysore convened the first conference of Kannada writers from all parts of the country in Bangalore in 1915. The conference decided among other things to establish the Kannada Sahitya Parishat on the lines of the Karnataka Vidyavardhak Sangha. Mr. Deshpande and Justice R.A. Jagirdar (later the first Vice Chancellor of Karnataka University), served on a committee appointed by the conference to draft the constitution of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat. Thus came into being yet another organization working for the welfare of the Kannada country as a whole.  Resolution of Unification  Strengthened by these developments, the Karnatak Vidhyavardhak Sangha at its meeting on 7 October 1917 passed a resolution urging the Government of India to bring under one administrative unit all the Kannada towns, talukas and districts then under the British rule and name the unit as the Karnataka province. This demand was reiterated in 1923 and on 25 February 1935 telegrams were sent to the Viceroy to bring under one administration all Kannada speaking areas. The Sangha was responsible to a certain extent in the founding of the Karnataka Research Institute in 1937. the Karnataka University in 1949, the All India Radio station at Dharwad in 1950, etc.  Golden Jubilee  The Sangha's Golden Jubilee was celebrated in 1940. As a prelude to the celebrations, the Sangha organized a function at which the portrait of the founder of the Sangha, Mr. R.H.Deshpande was unveiled by Prof. B.M. Sreekantiah, popularly known as Kannadada Kanva on 14 April 1940.  Today's Sangha  In recent years, the Sangha has enlarged its scope of activities and for this purpose has set up committees to conduct activities in the areas of Education, publications, Literary, Art and Culture, Women's Issues, Science and Technology, Social Welfare, Children's Issues, Folklore, etc. The Sangha is housed in a historic building across from the Municipal Corporation in the heart of Dharwad town.

It was dedicated to Theodore of Amasea and given to the Orthodox community of Rome by Pope John Paul II in 2004. It and is located on an ancient road between the Roman Forum and Forum Boarium, along the north-western foot of the Palatine Hill. History  Catholic church  It may first have been built as early as the 6th century in the ruins of the granaries of Agrippa. The unusual round shape suggests it may have been built into the ruined shell of a temple similar in construction to the well-preserved nymphaeum once identified as the Temple of Minerva Medica. An ancient pagan altar was placed in the atrium in front of the church, and an early Christian mosaic was found on the site. The apsis mosaic dates to the 6th century and shows Christ (in black clothing with gold lati clavi, which on Roman garments indicated high rank) seated on an orb representing the heavens, flanked by Peter and Paul and by the two martyrs Theodore (a later addition, from Nicholas V's restoration) and Cleonicus. Close up view The church is also traditionally one of the seven original deaconries in Rome, being assigned to a deacon by Pope Agatho (ca. 678), though the first titular deacon known by name was Roberto, ca. 1073, who died before 1099. There is no definitive evidence of the church's existence before the 9th century. As the dedication to an eastern saint suggests, this places it in a period of strong Byzantine influence in Rome. It was rebuilt under Pope Nicholas V, had its long-held titular church status suppressed by Pope Sixtus V, was renovated by Francesco Barberini in 1643, and rebuilt and given to the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Pope Clement XI and his architect Carlo Fontana in 1703-1705\\\\. Its titulus was reestablished on 2 December 1959 by Pope John XXIII, with William Theodore Heard (1959-1970, pro hac vice presbyterial titular 1970-1973). The last titular of the church was Vincenzo Fagiolo, who died on 22 September 2000.  Orthodox church Pope John Paul II announced in November 2000 that he was granting the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Greek Orthodox community in Rome use of the church, with the official inauguration taking place on 1 July 2004, presided over by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople.  Interior  At the back of the atrium, outside the church, is an ossuary with stacked skulls and bones, visible through a grille. The Capitoline Wolf was kept in this church until the 16th century.

He was a student of Pyotr Isakov (guitar) and Iogann Admoni (composition) at the Rimski-Korsakov Music College in Leningrad. Vavilov was active as a performer on both lute and guitar, as a music editor for a state music publishing house, and more importantly, as a composer. He routinely ascribed his own works to other composers, usually of the Renaissance or Baroque (occasionally from later eras), usually with total disregard of the appropriate style, in the spirit of other mystificators of the previous eras. His works achieved enormous circulation, and some of them achieved true folk-music status, with several poems set to his melodies. Vavilov died in poverty, aged 47, of pancreatic cancer, a few months before the appearance of \\"The City of Gold\\", which became a hit overnight. The most famous of his anonymous or misattributed compositions are: *\\"Canzona by Francesco da Milano\\". Poets Anri Volokhonsky and Alexei Khvostenko would later set lyrics on this music, the song called \\"The City of Gold\\" song (in Russian \\"–ì–æ—Ä–æ–¥ –ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–π\\").

They regulated social, political, religious, and economic life in these areas. The laws are composed of myriad decrees issued over the centuries and the important laws of the 16th century, which attempted to regulate the interactions between the settlers and natives, such as the Laws of Burgos (1512) and the New Laws (1542).Throughout the 400 years of Spanish presence in these parts of the world, the laws were compiled several times, most notably in 1680 under Charles II in the Recopilaci√≥n de las Leyes de los Reins de las Indias (Compilation of the Laws of the Kingdoms of the Indies). This became considered the classic collection of the laws, although later laws superseded parts of it, and other compilations were issued. History The Spanish Viceroyalties in the Americas sometimes generated conflicts between indigenous peoples ('Natives' or 'Indians')and the Spanish colonists. The Spanish attempted to control the Natives to force their labor. At the same time, conflicts on policy and implementation occurred between the encomenderos and the Crown. Two of the main sets of laws issued in the 16th century regulated Spanish interaction with the Native peoples, an issue about which the Crown quickly became concerned soon after the voyages of Christopher Columbus and his governorship. The Laws of Burgos (1512), signed by King Ferdinand II of Aragon, focused upon the welfare of the conquered native peoples. The issue was revisited after Bartolom√© de las Casas brought attention to abuses being carried out by encomenderos. The Laws of Burgos were revised by the New Laws of 1542 issued by Carlos I and quickly revised again in 1552, after the laws met resistance from colonists. These were followed by the Ordinances Concerning Discoveries in 1573, which forbade any unauthorized operations against independent Native Americans.\\"Indies, Laws of the\\" . (2006). In Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. Retrieved November 22, 2006, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Colegio de San Gregorio, Valladolid Colegio de San Gregorio, where the Laws of the Indies were born The Valladolid debate (1550‚Äì1551) was the first moral debate in European history to discuss the rights and treatment of a colonized people by colonizers. Held in the Colegio de San Gregorio, in the Spanish city of Valladolid, it was a moral and theological debate about the colonization of the Americas, its justification for the conversion to Catholicism and more specifically about the relations between the European settlers and the natives of the New World. It consisted of a number of opposing views about the way natives were to be integrated into colonial life, their conversion to Christianity and their rights and obligations. According to the French historian Jean Dumont The Valladolid debate was a major turning point in world history ‚ÄúIn that moment in Spain appeared the dawn of the human rights‚Äù. To guide and regularize the establishment of presidios (military towns), missions, and pueblos (civilian towns), King Phillip II developed the first version of the Laws of the Indies. This comprehensive guide was composed of 148 ordinances to aid colonists in locating, building, and populating settlements. These ordinances would be used throughout what is now called South America, Central America, Mexico and the US American West. They codified the city planning process and represented some of the first attempts at a general plan. Signed in 1573, the Laws of the Indies are considered the first wide-ranging guidelines towards design and development of communities. These laws were heavily influenced by Vitruvius' Ten Books of Architecture and Leon Battista Alberti's treatises on the subject. Examples: town planning In Book IV of the 1680 compilation of The Laws of the Indies, plans were set forth in detail on every facet of creating a community, including town planning. Examples of the range of rules include: * Those [Colonists] who should want to make a commitment to building a new settlement in the form and manner already prescribed, be it of more or less than 30 vecinos (freemen), (know that) it should be of no less than twelve persons and be awarded the authorization and territory in accordance with the prescribed conditions. * Having made the selection of the site where the town is to be built, it must, as already stated, be in an elevated and healthy location; [be] with means of fortification; [have] fertile soil and with plenty of land for farming and pasturage; have fuel, timber, and resources; [have] fresh water, a native population, ease of transport, access and exit; [and be] open to the north wind; and, if on the coast, due consideration should be paid to the quality of the harbor and that the sea does not lie to the south or west; and if possible not near lagoons or marshes in which poisonous animals and polluted air and water breed. * They [Colonists] shall try as far as possible to have the buildings all of one type for the sake of the beauty of the town. * Within the town, a commons shall be delimited, large enough that although the population may experience a rapid expansion, there will always be sufficient space where the people may go to for recreation and take their cattle to pasture without them making any damage. * Plan of the walled city of Manila with elements of colonial planning presentThe site and building lots for slaughterhouses, fisheries, tanneries, and other business which produce filth shall be so placed that the filth can easily be disposed of. These rules are part of a body of 148 regulations configuring any settlement according to the rule of Spain and its colonies. This continued as a precedent in all towns under Spanish control until the relinquishing of the land to others, as in the case of the American colonies and their growth. The Laws of the Indies are still used as an example to design guidelines for communities today.https://archpaper.com/2019/08/250th-anniversary-san-diego- update/ The Laws specify many details of towns. A plan is made centered on a Plaza Mayor (main square) of size within specified limits, from which twelve straight streets are built in a rectilinear grid. The directions of the streets are chosen according to the prevailing winds, to protect the Plaza Mayor. The guidelines recommend a hospital for non-contagious cases near the church, and one for contagious diseases further away.\\"Foundation of the Spanish-American towns\\", arquba.com Most townships founded in any part of the Spanish Empire in America before the various parts became independent countries were planned according to the Laws. These include many townships with Spanish names located in what is now the United States. The creation of a central square and rectilinear grid of streets was different from the haphazard and organic growth that led to meandering streets in many old townships in Iberia.

LPHS serves the communities and surrounding areas of LaSalle, Peru, Oglesby, Tonica, and Dimmick. The campus is located 18 miles west of Ottawa, Illinois. The high school takes students from the following townships: Dimmick, Waltham, Peru, LaSalle, Utica, Deer Park, Eden, Vermillion, Hope, and Richland.  History  LaSalle-Peru Township High School was built in 1897‚Äì98, occupying buildings on 5th, 6th and Chartres Streets in LaSalle. The Thomas J. McCormack Library was built in 1920. LaSalle-Peru-Oglesby Junior College was formed at the school in 1924. L-P-O Junior College eventually became Illinois Valley Community College in 1968, and is now located in Oglesby, Illinois. The school's clock tower was built in 1927 and is still in use today. Matthiessen Memorial Auditorium was opened in 1928. Howard Fellows Stadium was opened in 1937. Howard Fellows Stadium was massively renovated in the summer of 1995. There have been many additions throughout the years at L-P High School, including the West Gymnasium, Area Career Center and Dolan Building. In 1952, the LP band director at the time skirted the policies of LaSalle, which, at that point, was a \\"Sundown town\\", to have an integrated band. He was trying to coordinate the visit of a Big Ten school, and the university had African American members, and the director accommodated them accordingly. This event is largely considered to have been the beginning of the end of segregation and racism in the Illinois Valley.  Academics  On the 2010 Prairie State Achievement Exam, 49% of L-P High School 11th graders met or exceeded standards in Reading. 45% met or exceeded standards in Mathematics, and 50% met or exceeded standards in Science.  Athletics  L-P's athletic teams are called the Cavaliers. The Cavaliers compete in essentially the same sports as most mid-size high schools in the Midwest. Highlights *The football team took 2nd place in the state in 1977, 1978, and 1979. *The boys track team placed 3rd place in the state 1921. In 2000 LP's Drama team placed first in NCIC and sectional and went on to state competition with their performance of Bang Bang You're Dead. *In 2009, the baseball team placed 4th in the 3A IHSA state competition. *On October 9, 2009, the LaSalle-Peru Varsity football team beat rival Geneseo 38 to 36 by making a field goal with 3 seconds left on the clock. This marked the first time LaSalle-Peru had beaten Geneseo in Varsity football since 1919. Conference affiliation From 1964 to 2010, the Cavaliers competed in the North Central Illinois Conference (NCIC), in that conference's larger-school division. Significant changes in conference alignments occurred in the 2000s, however, and starting with the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, LPHS became a charter member of the Northern Illinois Big 12 Conference. The NIB-12 includes most of the larger schools from the NCIC, as well as many members of a dissolving conference called the Western Sun Conference.

School of honor, glory and fame, With true pride we're praising your name. Known throughout the country and state As a school that's truly great. Everyone is singing your praise, All our voices loudly we raise. Aways upright, noble and true, Hurrah! La Salle- Peru! Red And Green was written by Susan Jane Hoelle.  Demographics  As of 2010, the ethnic makeup of L-P High School was 85.7% White, 11.4% Hispanic, 2% Black, 0.9% Asian, and 0.2% Native American. 0.5% were said to be at a low English proficiency level. 27.7% were said to be at a low income level.  Culture   LP vs. SBA  One of the many local rivalries is with local Saint Bede Academy. They compete in most sports except American Football . The last game took place in 1985.  Yearbook  In 2009, LP's yearbook was named one of the 36 USA Yearbooks Of The Year by Jostens. The Marching Cavaliers LaSalle-Peru's marching band was noted for being not only one of the best bands in the state and country, but was also known throughout Europe as well.

EXPRESS is formalized in the ISO Standard for the Exchange of Product model STEP (ISO 10303), and standardized as ISO 10303-11.ISO 10303-11:2004 Industrial automation systems and integration -- Product data representation and exchange -- Part 11: Description methods: The EXPRESS language reference manual  Overview  Data models formally define data objects and relationships among data objects for a domain of interest. Some typical applications of data models include supporting the development of databases and enabling the exchange of data for a particular area of interest. Data models are specified in a data modeling language.Michael R. McCaleb (1999). \\"A Conceptual Data Model of Datum Systems\\". National Institute of Standards and Technology. August 1999. EXPRESS is a data modeling language defined in ISO 10303-11, the EXPRESS Language Reference Manual.ISO International Standard 10303-11:1994, Industrial automation systems and integration ‚Äî Product data representation andexchange ‚Äî Part 11: Description methods: The EXPRESS language reference manual, International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, Switzerland (1994). An EXPRESS data model can be defined in two ways, textually and graphically. For formal verification and as input for tools such as SDAI the textual representation within an ASCII file is the most important one. The graphical representation on the other hand is often more suitable for human use such as explanation and tutorials. The graphical representation, called EXPRESS-G, is not able to represent all details that can be formulated in the textual form. EXPRESS is similar to programming languages such as Pascal. Within a SCHEMA various datatypes can be defined together with structural constraints and algorithmic rules. A main feature of EXPRESS is the possibility to formally validate a population of datatypes - this is to check for all the structural and algorithmic rules.  EXPRESS-G  EXPRESS-G is a standard graphical notation for information models.4 EXPRESS-G Language Overview . Accessed 9 Nov 2008. It is a companion to the EXPRESS language for displaying entity and type definitions, relationships and cardinality.For information on the EXPRESS-G notation, consult Annex B of the EXPRESS Language Reference Manual (ISO 10303-11) This graphical notation supports a subset of the EXPRESS language. One of the advantages of using EXPRESS-G over EXPRESS is that the structure of a data model can be presented in a more understandable manner. A disadvantage of EXPRESS-G is that complex constraints cannot be formally specified. Figure 1 is an example. The data model presented in figure could be used to specify the requirements of a database for an audio compact disc (CD) collection.  Simple example  Fig 2. An EXPRESS-G diagram for Family schema A simple EXPRESS data model looks like fig 2, and the code like this: SCHEMA Family; ENTITY Person ABSTRACT SUPERTYPE OF (ONEOF (Male, Female)); name: STRING; mother: OPTIONAL Female; father: OPTIONAL Male; END_ENTITY; ENTITY Female SUBTYPE OF (Person); END_ENTITY; ENTITY Male SUBTYPE of (Person); END_ENTITY; END_SCHEMA; The data model is enclosed within the EXPRESS schema Family. It contains a supertype entity Person with the two subtypes Male and Female. Since Person is declared to be ABSTRACT only occurrences of either (ONEOF) the subtype Male or Female can exist. Every occurrence of a person has a mandatory name attribute and optionally attributes mother and father. There is a fixed style of reading for attributes of some entity type: * a Female can play the role of mother for a Person * a Male can play the role of father for a Person  EXPRESS Building blocks   Datatypes  EXPRESS offers a series of datatypes, with specific data type symbols of the EXPRESS-G notation: center * Entity data type: This is the most important datatype in EXPRESS. It is covered below in more detail. Entity datatypes can be related in two ways, in a sub-supertype tree and/or by attributes. * Enumeration data type: Enumeration values are simple strings such as red, green, and blue for an rgb- enumeration. In the case that an enumeration type is declared extensible it can be extended in other schemas. * Defined data type: This further specializes other datatypes--e.g., define a datatype positive that is of type integer with a value > 0. * Select data type: Selects define a choice or an alternative between different options. Most commonly used are selects between different entity_types. More rare are selects that include defined types. In the case that an enumeration type is declared extensible, it can be extended in other schemas. * Simple data type ** String: This is the most often used simple type. EXPRESS strings can be of any length and can contain any character (ISO 10646/Unicode). ** Binary: This data type is only very rarely used. It covers a number of bits (not bytes). For some implementations the size is limited to 32 bit. ** Logical: Similar to the boolean datatype a logical has the possible values TRUE and FALSE and in addition UNKNOWN. ** Boolean: With the boolean values TRUE and FALSE. ** Number: The number data type is a supertype of both, integer and real. Most implementations take uses a double type to represent a real_type, even if the actual value is an integer. ** Integer: EXPRESS integers can have in principle any length, but most implementations restricted them to a signed 32 bit value. ** Real: Ideally an EXPRESS real value is unlimited in accuracy and size. But in practice a real value is represented by a floating point value of type double. * Aggregation data type: The possible kinds of aggregation_types are SET, BAG, LIST and ARRAY. While SET and BAG are unordered, LIST and ARRAY are ordered. A BAG may contain a particular value more than once, this is not allowed for SET. An ARRAY is the only aggregate that may contain unset members. This is not possible for SET, LIST, BAG. The members of an aggregate may be of any other data type. A few general things are to be mentioned for datatypes. * Constructed datatypes can be defined within an EXPRESS schema. They are mainly used to define entities, and to specify the type of entity attributes and aggregate members. * Datatypes can be used in a recursive way to build up more and more complex data types. E.g. it is possible to define a LIST of an ARRAY of a SELECT of either some entities or other datatypes. If it makes sense to define such datatypes is a different question. * EXPRESS defines a couple of rules how a datatype can be further specialized. This is important for re- declared attributes of entities. * GENERIC data types can be used for procedures, functions and abstract entities.  Entity-Attribute  Entity attributes allow to add \\"properties\\" to entities and to relate one entity with another one in a specific role. The name of the attribute specifies the role. Most datatypes can directly serve as type of an attribute. This includes aggregation as well. There are three different kinds of attributes, explicit, derived and inverse attributes. And all these can be re-declared in a subtype. In addition an explicit attribute can be re-declared as derived in a subtype. No other change of the kind of attributes is possible. * Explicit attributes are those with direct values visible in a STEP-File. * Derived attributes get their values from an expression. In most cases the expression refers to other attributes of THIS instance. The expression may also use EXPRESS functions. * Inverse attributes do not add \\"information\\" to an entity, but only name and constrain an explicit attribute to an entity from the other end. Specific attribute symbols of the EXPRESS-G notation: center  Supertypes and subtypes  An entity can be defined to be a subtype of one or several other entities (multiple inheritance is allowed!). A supertype can have any number of subtypes. It is very common practice in STEP to build very complex sub- supertype graphs. Some graphs relate 100 and more entities with each other. An entity instance can be constructed for either a single entity (if not abstract) or for a complex combination of entities in such a sub-supertype graph. For the big graphs the number of possible combinations is likely to grow in astronomic ranges. To restrict the possible combinations special supertype constraints got introduced such as ONEOF and TOTALOVER. Furthermore, an entity can be declared to be abstract to enforce that no instance can be constructed of just this entity but only if it contains a non-abstract subtype.  Algorithmic constraints  Entities and defined data types may be further constrained with rules. rules are also part of global rules. A rule is an expression, which must evaluate to TRUE, otherwise a population of an EXPRESS schema, is not valid. Like derived attributes these expression may invoke EXPRESS functions, which may further invoke EXPRESS procedures. The functions and procedures allow formulating complex statements with local variables, parameters and constants - very similar to a programming language. The EXPRESS language can describe local and global rules. For example: ENTITY area_unit SUBTYPE OF (named_unit); WHERE WR1: (SELF amed_unit.dimensions.length_exponent = 2) AND (SELF amed_unit.dimensions.mass_exponent = 0) AND (SELF amed_unit.dimensions.time_exponent = 0) AND (SELF amed_unit.dimensions.electric_current_exponent = 0) AND (SELF amed_unit.dimensions. thermodynamic_temperature_exponent = 0) AND (SELF amed_unit.dimensions.amount_of_substance_exponent = 0) AND (SELF amed_unit.dimensions.luminous_intensity_exponent = 0); END_ENTITY; -- area_unit This example describes that area_unit entity must have square value of length. For this the attribute dimensions.length_exponent must be equal to 2 and all other exponents of basic SI units must be 0. Another example: TYPE day_in_week_number = INTEGER; WHERE WR1: (1 <= SELF) AND (SELF <= 7); END_TYPE; -- day_in_week_number That is, it means that week value cannot exceed 7. And so, you can describe some rules to your entities.

The Ming Palace (), also known as the \\"Forbidden City of Nanjing\\", was the 14th-century imperial palace of the early Ming dynasty, when Nanjing was the capital of China.  History  14th century Zhu Yuanzhang, who became the founder and first Emperor of the Ming dynasty, began building a palace in what was then known as Jiankang in 1367. At the time, he was self-styled \\"King of Wu\\". The palace was built outside the existing city of Jiankang, and was completed by 1368. With its completion, Zhu proclaimed the Ming Dynasty; with himself as the first emperor, known as the Hongwu Emperor; and that Jiankang, now Yingtian, was the \\"southern capital\\" (\\"nanjing\\") of his empire. For the next few years, few changes were made to the palace in Nanjing as the Emperor focused on building the \\"middle capital\\", located in his home town of Fengyang. In 1373 the Hongwu Emperor shifted his focus back to Nanjing, with a substantial program of expansion and refurbishment of the palace which was completed in 1375. Further expansion occurred in 1392. In 1398 the Hongwu Emperor died, and was succeeded by his grandson, the Jianwen Emperor. A civil war soon ensued as Zhu Di, son of the Hongwu Emperor and uncle of the Jianwen Emperor, sought to take the crown from his nephew. 15th‚Äî18th centuries In 1402, Zhu Di took Nanjing and ascended the throne as the Yongle Emperor. The Jianwen Emperor disappeared amid a fire at the imperial Ming Palace. The Yongle Emperor was keen to return to Beiping (now Beijing), where he was enfeoffed as a prince. To accomplish this, he raised Beiping to the status of a second capital, adding a Jing suffix to its name - Beiping therefore became the \\"northern capital\\", Beijing. Zhu Di began building a palace in Beijing. The Nanjing palace lost its position as the emperor's main residence to Beijing's Forbidden City in 1420 when the Yongle Emperor officially relocated the imperial capital to Beijing. Nanjing retained the status of the \\"reserve\\" capital throughout the almost three centuries of the Ming era, with its own \\"reserve\\" court and \\"reserve\\" ministries, and the palace was placed in the care of officials of the Imperial Household Department. However, the palace was afflicted with a series of fires, which caused damages that were, for the most part, not repaired. In 1449, the three main halls of the Outer Court (the ceremonial seat of government) burned down and were never rebuilt. Other fires destroyed other parts of the palace. After the fall of Beijing to Li Zicheng's rebels (and, soon thereafter, to the Qing dynasty) in 1644, the Nanjing Ming Palace briefly became the seat of the Prince of Fu, who was crowned the \\"Hongguang Emperor\\" in Nanjing in an attempt to continue the Ming dynasty (one of a series of short-lived regimes known collectively as the Southern Ming dynasty). By this time only a small portion of the palace was intact, and the Hongguang Emperor set about rebuilding some sections of the palace. However, the following year (1645) the Qing armies reached Nanjing. The Hongguang Emperor fled and officials of the \\"reserve\\" court surrendered. Under the Qing dynasty, the former imperial sector of Nanjing was garrisoned by the Manchu armies of the Eight Banners, with the palace itself becoming the yamen of two military commands. Throughout the Qing dynasty, the Ming palace was gradually demolished, with stone and carvings taken away to be used as building material and decorative elements on other projects. By the time of the Kangxi Emperor and the Qianlong Emperor's tours of Nanjing in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Ming palace was already in ruin, and the two emperors both stayed elsewhere in the city. 19th century When the Taiping Revolution leaders declared Nanjing to be the capital of their Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, they chose not to restore the Ming Palace, but to build a new Palace of the Heavenly King. In this process, they sourced a large amount of construction material from the remains of the Ming Palace, until almost nothing remained of the buildings and walls. When the Taiping Revolution was defeated, the Qing troops razed the new palace in 1864, and built new traditional-style government buildings on that site. 20th century The Republic of China (1912-49) established Nanjing as its capital in 1928, and transformed one of the Qing buildings into the Presidential Palace. The planned development of the capital called for a new central executive zone to be built, around the Presidential Palace, on the former Ming Palace complex grounds. The plan was never completed. In 1929, a major road, present day East Zhongshan Road, was built in an east-west direction across the palace complex site, dividing it into northern and a southern portions. In the 1930s, a series of buildings were built in and around the northern portion of the palace complex site, including the offices of two Kuomintang party organs, in a \\"neo-classical\\" style referencing traditional palace architecture, placed symmetrically near the old east and west palace gates.Cits.net: \\"Nanjing Presidential Palace, the Nanjing Version of Forbidden City\\" The National Central Museum, the present day Nanjing Museum building, was also built in the northern section. The southern portion became a small airstrip. The building of the airstrip resulted in the demolition of the two protruding arms of the Meridian Gate, the impressive former front gate of the Ming Palace complex. The Ming Palace today No building within the palace survives today. Among other structures, the gate platforms of the Meridian Gate (the southern, front gate of the palace), Donghua Gate (the Gate of Eastern Glory, the eastern gate of the palace), and the Xi'an Gate (the Gate of Western Peace, the western outer gate of the palace) survive, though none of the wooden gatehouses survive, and the protruding wings of the Meridian Gate have been demolished. The inner and outer bridges of the Golden Water, which lie on the main north-south axis just inside and just outside the front gate respectively, survive. A number of isolated column elements and stone carvings also survive, and a number of foundations have been excavated. The site of the three halls of the Outer Court has been established as a commemorative park, while the area around the Meridian Gate is also a park. Many of the remaining stone carvings and architectural components of the palace have been moved to the latter park and are arranged for display. Large parts of the former palace are now occupied by various agencies and organisations such as the Aeronautical and Aerospace University of Nanjing, the Archives of the Nanjing Military District, and the No. 2 Historical Archives of China. Transportation The palace is accessible from Minggugong Station of Nanjing Metro.

The cartoon follows Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy working as janitors in a tall clock tower. The film was directed by Ben Sharpsteen and features original music by Paul Smith and Oliver Wallace. The voice cast includes Walt Disney as Mickey, Clarence Nash as Donald, and Pinto Colvig as Goofy.Clock Cleaners at The Encyclopedia of Animated Disney ShortsClock Cleaners at the Big Cartoon DataBase It was the 97th short in the Mickey Mouse film series to be released, and the eighth for that year. Clock Cleaners is one of Disney's most critically acclaimed short films. In 1994, 1000 members of the animation field voted Clock Cleaners as the 27th greatest cartoon of all time.Beck, Jerry (ed.) (1994). The 50 Greatest Cartoons: As Selected by 1,000 Animation Professionals. Atlanta: Turner Publishing. . This cartoon was released two months before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).  Synopsis  Mickey, Donald, and Goofy are assigned to clean a tall clock tower in New York City. Mickey is outside cleaning the face with a mop by riding on the second hand. Goofy is inside the building cleaning gear teeth with a large toothbrush. Donald (singing \\"Hickory Dickory Dock\\") starts to mop the mainspring, ignoring several warning signs. He gets the mop caught and springs it loose. Meanwhile, Mickey, now cleaning inside the clock, comes across a sleeping stork which he tries unsuccessfully to remove. As he throws the stork out of the tower, it flies back in and snatches Mickey, carrying him as if he were a baby, then letting go of Mickey before flying back in. Mickey is left hanging on a rope outside the tower. Back inside, Donald is getting the mainspring back into place with a mallet, but he struggles to get the very last piece in place. Donald gets furious at the spring and asks \\"What's the big idea?\\". The spring seems to respond with an echo of Donald's question. Donald gets into an argument with the spring, culminating in him hitting the spring with the mallet, but it (the spring) sends it back and knocks him off. Donald gets his head stuck in a gear on the balance wheel shaft. When he finally is free from it, the oscillation makes his body continue to move. Now outside, Goofy (singing \\"Asleep in the Deep\\") is cleaning the outside bell. As he is cleaning the interior of the bell, it becomes 4:00 PM, causing two mechanical statues to come from inside the tower and ring the bell by taking turns striking it, for a total of four times. The first figure (resembling Father Time) approaches without Goofy noticing. When the bell rings with Goofy inside it, his head vibrates violently and he sits down. Before he has regained his composure the statue has returned to the tower, and he then looks around suspiciously and says \\"Mice!\\" This is a reference to W.C. Fields who used the same line, when there was a crash backstage during one of his comedy acts. The second figure, representing Lady Liberty, rings the bell from the other side and he is once again vibrated. After the second ring, Goofy is determined to be ready for the next time. As the bell is struck a third time, he leaps out and is ready to attack, but when he sees Lady Liberty coming for the fourth ring, he idiotically, chivalrously, apologizes and bows. But Goofy is standing between her torch and the bell, and he receives a big knock to the head. This puts Goofy in a dizzy lovestruck stupor for the rest of the film. Mickey is alarmed when he sees Goofy almost fall and tries to save him. At each turn, Mickey is just barely able to save Goofy. At last, Goofy lands on a flag pole that sends him and Mickey to fly through a window into the clock, land on the mainspring which Donald had finally managed to put back together (now undoing all the springs again), then all three land in the same gear in which Donald was stuck earlier, causing their bodies to move in a humorous rhythm to the tune of The Streets of Cairo. Cast *Walt Disney as Mickey Mouse *Clarence Nash as Donald Duck *Pinto Colvig as Goofy  Controversy  Donald confronts the talking mainspring. During the 1990s, Donald Wildmon and his fundamentalist Christian organization the American Family Association persuaded Wal-Mart to discontinue the sale of the VHS tape Cartoon Classics: Fun on the Job!, which included Clock Cleaners, due to two perceived uses of inappropriate language by Donald Duck. During his fight with the mainspring Donald responds to the taunting spring by saying \\"Says who!?\\" (which is made clear by the spring replying, \\"Says I!\\") and then threatens the mainspring, calling it a \\"snake in the grass\\". However, due to Donald's unintelligible \\"duck voice\\", some believed that he was instead saying \\"fuck you\\" to the mainspring and calling it a \\"son of a bitch\\". Due to this controversy, when the film was released on the Walt Disney Treasures DVD set Mickey Mouse in Living Color (2001), Donald's \\"Says who?\\" line was redubbed with the line \\"Aw, nuts!\\", originally from the On Ice soundtrack. The edit is made obvious by the sound of Pluto barking in the background. The \\"snake in the grass\\" line was also redubbed. The same edits occur on several later DVD releases, including The Great Mouse Detective (2002) which included the cartoon as a bonus feature in reference to that film's climatic battle in and around Big Ben, Funny Factory with Goofy (2006), and the bonus Epic Mickey DVD (2010). Other DVD releases have kept the original line, such as Alice in Wonderland: Masterpiece Edition (2004) which included the cartoon as part of the TV special \\"One Hour in Wonderland\\", and Have a Laugh!: Volume 2 (2010) which also included the film's original RKO title cards. More recent broadcasts of the cartoon on Disney Channel have also included the original line. On Disney+, Nash's voice line is cleaned up and the snake in the grass line is still gibberish. In the 1980s, Mickey struggling to shove the stork out of the clock tower was deleted, due to time constraints.

Most of his work, in both oils and fresco (these usually for ceilings), depicted religious subjects. A papal knight, he is often referred to as Cavalliere Massimo Stanzione, especially in older sources. Biography Born in Frattamaggiore, Napleshttp://www.nobili- napoletani.it/Iadicicco.htm in 1585, Massimo Stanzione was influenced by Caravaggio. What distinguished Massimo‚Äôs art from that of Caravaggio's was that he combined the latter's dramatically lit and brutally realistic style with the classical and lyrical manner of Bolognesi painters, earning him the nickname of the Napolitan Guido Reni. Though his preliminary training is uncertain, it is thought that he studied with Fabrizio Santafede and Battistello Caracciolo;Caravaggio i la pintura realista europea / comissari Jose Milicua; coordinacio cientifica Maria Margarita Cuyas. Barcelona:MNAC, 2005 P. 431 however, most of the influence he received was from Caravaggio. Art historians believe that Stanzione developed his career as an artist in Rome. It is thought that he began his career as a portraitist. Some of his most famous works include Portrait of a Woman in Popular Costume, and Portrait of Jerome Banks. His first trip to Rome was in 1617 to 1618, where he worked in Santa Maria della Scala, where traces of his work remain. He returned to the Eternal City several times between 1620 and about 1630. In Rome he underwent the influence of Annibale Carracci and of the revamped Caravaggism of Simon Vouet, among others. In 1621, pope Gregory XV awarded him the title of Knight of the Golden Spur and in 1627, he received the title of Knight of Saint George and Urban VIII invested him with the Order of Christ which, in Spain, gave him the title Caballero M√°ximo. Along with Jusepe de Ribera, Stanzione was the principal Neapolitan painter during the first half of the 17th century. This was due to his vast altarpieces and frescoes and of course his following of students and imitators. Massimo‚Äôs rich color and idealized naturalism had a large influence on other local artists, such as Francesco Solimena. It is believed that Massimo Stanzione died during the plague of 1656.

In 1630, it was a center of opportunity for artistic commissions. Many of these artistic commissions were sought after by the Spanish Viceroys who maintained positions of political power in Naples at this time. Other art enthusiasts arrived from various Mediterranean ports in Naples looking for artistic expertise. Stanzione along with Bernardo Cavallino and most importantly Artemisia Gentileschi represented a new and more graceful painting style. Apparently Stanzione‚Äôs artistic relationship with Gentileschi was significant in his development as an artist. Documentation shows that Stanzione and Gentileschi both moved to Naples the same year, 1630. De Dominici describes the relationship between Gentileschi and Stanzione as an informal apprenticeship. Stanzione joined Artemisia daily to observe her while she painted and may have imitated her coloring style, but not her design style. There is no written proof to substantiate this hypothesis because the fact remains that Stanzione had a tremendous amount of interaction with other colorists throughout this time and also he was already established artistically in Rome by 1617 when he was working with Saraceni and Honthrost at the Santa Maria della Scala. The S.M. della Scala was one of the first hospitals in Europe. The hospital had its own organization, which was set up as a means to care for pilgrims, assist the poor and provide for abandoned children. However, later writers credited Artemisia with influencing Stanzione‚Äôs rich light effects and greater classicizing. Gentileschi and Stanzioni collaborated on certain works such as Birth of St. John the Baptist for Philip IV‚Äôs Buen Retiro Palace. The two artists compromised their styles; Gentileschi subdued her realist style of tenebrism and substituted it with more even lighting and classical composition, and the two succeeded in creating an agreeable collection. Stanzione‚Äôs Saint Agatha In Prison along with his Young Saint John the Baptist were his first known works. Those works combine the influence of Reni and Domenichino among others to create a composition of ‚Äúlyric classicism‚Äù.

He joined professional sumo in 1981, reaching the top makuuchi division just two years later. He reached the second highest rank of ≈çzeki in 1987 and became the 63rd yokozuna in the history of the sport in 1990 at the age of 30. He won four tournaments and was a runner-up on nine other occasions. He retired in 1992 and is now the head coach of Isegahama stable. Early life He was born in the fishing town of Kizukuri in Nishitsugaru District. His father, who worked as an electrician, was a keen amateur sumo enthusiast and Vice President of the Prefectural Sumo Federation. He was determined to see his son succeed in sumo and even built a dohy≈ç in the garden for him to practise. Asahifuji also did well at sumo at school, finishing third in a national schoolboy competition, and later winning the West Japan Student Newcomers tournament while studying at Kinki University. However, tiring of the never-ending training, he gave up sumo for a while and spent his time fishing. Eventually an acquaintance of his father introduced him to ≈åshima-oyakata, former ≈çzeki Asahikuni, who had recently opened his own heya or stable of wrestlers, ≈åshima stable. Early sumo career Asahifuji made his professional debut in January 1981. He was already 20 years old, considerably older than most new recruits who tend to be 15 or 16. However, because of his amateur sumo experience he was able to work his way up the ranks very quickly and won tournament championships in the jonokuchi, sandanme and makushita divisions with perfect records. He reached the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division after only eight tournaments, a record that stood unbeaten until 2008. He was promoted to the top makuuchi division in March 1983. He won his first special prize for Fighting Spirit in the November 1984 tournament, where he finished runner-up. He reached sekiwake rank for the first time in January 1986. After regular training sessions at Takasago stable, where he knew Asashio from his university days, he began to develop a more rounded technique, and after three double figure scores he was promoted to sumo's second highest rank of ≈çzeki after the September 1987 tournament. ≈åzeki In January 1988 he won his first top division tournament championship, which was also the first for the Tatsunami-Isegahama icihimon or group of stables in nearly twenty years. In 1989 he won 40 out of a possible 45 bouts in the first three championships of the year and came very close to promotion to the highest rank of yokozuna, but he was defeated by yokozuna Hokutoumi in playoffs in both January and May 1989. His 13‚Äì2 mark in May was his fifth consecutive runner-up performance, and his seventh overall, but he had been unable to win two tournaments in a row, regarded by the Japan Sumo Association as the minimum requirement for yokozuna promotion after the embarrassment of Futahaguro's brief tenure at sumo top's rank. After managing only 8‚Äì7 in the following tournament in July, Asahifuji endured a long slump. This was partly caused by longstanding pancreatic trouble, which had first been diagnosed in 1984 and had also afflicted his stablemaster during his active days. After a string of mediocre 8‚Äì7 and 9‚Äì6 scores it seemed Asahifuji would finish his career as an ≈çzeki. However, by mid-1990 his health began to improve, and after encouragement from his stablemaster, who reminded him that he would soon turn 30 years of age and was down to his last chance, he won consecutive championships in May and July 1990. He scored 14‚Äì1 in both tournaments, securing his yokozuna promotion on the final day in July by defeating yokozuna Chiyonofuji for only the fifth time in 28 meetings. Yokozuna Asahifuji began his yokozuna career with 12 straight wins in the September 1990 tournament, but he lost to Kirishima on Day 13 and was defeated by Hokutoumi in the championship deciding bout on the final day. In November 1990 he finished runner-up again, to Chiyonofuji. In January and March 1991 he posted reasonable scores of 11‚Äì4 but was never really in contention for the championship in either tournament, although he did have a memorable win over the young rising star Takahanada in March. He had to wait until May 1991 for his first title as a yokozuna, when he defeated Konishiki twice on the last day, once in their regulation match and once in the playoff, to finish with a fine 14‚Äì1 record. This was to prove Asahifuji's only tournament championship as a yokozuna, as the rest of his career was dogged by illness and injury. He managed only a bare majority of 8‚Äì7 in July 1991, the last tournament he was to complete. He pulled out of the September 1991 tournament with an injured shoulder on the sixth day, and hampered by the return of his old pancreatic problems missed the November 1991 tournament altogether. He returned in January 1992 but after losing his opening three bouts to Akebono, his nemesis Akinoshima (for the fifth time in a row) and finally Wakahanada, he announced his retirement at the age of 31. Asahifuj's three bout losing streak from the opening day was equal to the worst ever for a yokozuna in the 15-day era until Kisenosato lost his first four bouts in November 2018. He gave the worsening condition of his pancreas as the reason for his retirement. His danpatsu-shiki or retirement ceremony was held in September 1992. There were no active yokozuna at the time, so he was unable to follow the tradition of having yokozuna serve as his tachimochi and tsuyuharai for the event. After retirement Asahifuji has remained in the sumo world as a coach. He had married a niece of the former Kasugayama-oyakata (former maegashira ≈ånobori) in 1988, and seemed set to revive Kasugayama stable, but instead he took over the Ajigawa stable in 1993 due to the poor health of the previous incumbent (former sekiwake Mutsuarashi). The first top division wrestler he produced was Aminishiki in 2000, who reached the sekiwake rank in 2007. Aminishiki's brother As≈çfuji, who retired in 2011 after a match-fixing scandal, was also a briefly a top division wrestler. In November 2007 Asahifuji acquired the prestigious Isegahama elder name and renamed his stable Isegahama stable. (The Ajigawa name was acquired by Aminishiki and was loaned to Shikishima of Michinoku stable until July 2012, when Shikishima switched to the Urakaze name.) He has also worked as a judge at tournament matches. Asahifuji's greatest success as a trainer came with Harumafuji, who he recruited in 2001 and who initially fought under the shikona of Ama. Harumafuji reached the second highest rank of ≈çzeki in November 2008 and won his first top division championship in May 2009. Harumafuji took his second championship in July 2011, the same tournament in which Takarafuji, like Asahifuji a Kinki University graduate, made his top division debut. Homarefuji reached j≈´ry≈ç in 2012, and in September of that year Harumafuji was promoted to yokozuna following two consecutive 15‚Äì0 championships. Isegahama had motivated Harumafuji by telling him before his July 2011 championship, \\"If you are content with being ozeki then it is all over. You do not become a yokozuna just by wanting to be a yokozuna.\\" Like Asahifuji, Harumafuji performed the yokozuna ring entering ceremony or dohy≈ç-iri in the Shiranui style. He has continued to produce top wrestlers, with Takarafuji reaching komusubi rank and Terunofuji, inherited from the defunct Magaki stable, being promoted to ≈çzeki, both in 2015. He submitted Harumafuji's retirement papers to the Sumo Association on 29 November 2017 after the yokozuna took responsibility for an assault on fellow Mongolian Takanoiwa in a Tottori restaurant and bar the previous month. At a subsequent news conference Isegahama shed tears as he told reporters, \\"I've watched him grow since he was 16 and have never seen or heard of him being violent before...I can't imagine why it happened.\\" At a meeting on 20 December 2017 the Sumo Association accepted Isegahama's resignation as a director. He was moved to the competition inspection committee where he is a deputy chairman. He turned 60 in July 2020, and is expecting to have a kanreki dohyo-iri sometime in 2021, as he was forced to postpone it from May 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. He told reporters he was keeping fit but would need to put on weight to be able to wear his tsuna. Fighting style Asahifuji's favoured kimarite or techniques were listed by the Sumo Association as migi-yotsu ( a left hand outside, right hand inside grip on the opponent's mawashi), yorikiri (force out) and uwatedashinage (pulling overarm throw). However, he was also fond of employing more unorthodox techniques little used by other wrestlers and certainly not taught by coaches. He was criticised for this by his stablemaster, the former ≈çzeki and noted technician Asahikuni, whose view was that by winning by his own idiosyncratic methods, he would be unable to cure his faults. Asahifuji himself claimed in an interview with Channel 4 television to have no favourite technique, but did say that while \\"everyone likes to throw an opponent, that's not sumo.\\"\\"Sumo\\", Cheerleader Productions, Channel 4, 1990.

It served as the episcopal see of Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe. It is now a Roman Catholic titular bishopric.  Name  The name \\"Ruspe\\" is usually understood to be a hellenization of a Phoenician name including the element \\"rush\\" (, ), meaning \\"head\\" or \\"headland\\". The Tabula Peutingeriana notes the Byzacenan towns of Ruspina and Ruspe, the latter being to the south of the former.Image of section of the Tabula Peutingeriana with Ruspe Ptolemy's Geography usually mentions the same two towns in the same order,Henricus de Noris in Migne's Supplement to the Works of Augustine, Patrologia Latina, vol. 47, col. 297B although Stevenson's defective English translation gives \\"Ruspina\\" and \\"Rheuspena\\".Book IV, Chapter 3 The name \\"Ruspe\\", a Greek feminine singular name, also appears in a list of dioceses that the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria saw as dependent on itself at the beginning of the 8th century. Henricus de Noris considered it equivalent to the Latin Ruspa. \\"Ruspae\\", a Latin feminine plural name, was preferred by Alexander MacBean,Alexander MacBean, Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of Ancient Geography (G. Robinson, 1773) William Smith,William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) Morcelli; Mesnage, and the Annuario Pontificio. Geography According to the Tabula Peutingeriana, Ruspe was situated between Acholla and Usilla. It was near the promontory that Ptolemy called Brachodes, the Romans' Caput Vadorum, later known as Capaudia orin ArabicQaboudiaEdward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 5 (Baudry's European Library, 1840), chapter 41, footnote 15 (cf. Chebba). Ruspe was commonly identified with the ruins known as Sbia or Henchir Sbia in present-day Tunisia, four miles west of that cape.Sophrone P√©trid√®s, \\"Ruspe\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1912) An alternative site is that of the ruins known as Ksour Siad. In the mid-20th century, a new argument emerged in favour of Koudiat Rosfa, 30 kilometers north of Sfax,The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites (1976) because of the discovery in 1947 of an inscription at Henchir Bou TriaHenchir Bou Tria: Tunisia that seems to identify that place with ancient Acholla. (Saumagne had earlier proposed to identify it with Ruspe.) A nearby headland is called Rass Bou Tria.Rass Bou Tria This identification of Acholla gives grounds for considering Ptolemy mistaken in placing Acholla and Usilla north of Cape Brachodes and for identifying Ruspe as Koudiat Rosfa, which is seen as having preserved the ancient name in an Arabic form. Excavations at Koudiat Rosfa have not confirmed the perhaps flattering description applied to the city by Fulgentius's biographer Ferrandus: \\"a noble town illustrious for its famous inhabitants\\" ().G. Ch. Picard, \\"Ruspe\\" in Enciclopedia dell'Arte Antica (Treccani 1965) Religion  The city was important enough in the Roman province of Byzacena to become a suffragan of its Metropolitan of Archdiocese of Hadrumetum, but was to fade.

Adapted for the screen by Adrian Johnson, Camille was directed by J. Gordon Edwards and starred Theda Bara as Camille and Albert Roscoe as her lover, Armand. The film was produced by Fox Film Corporation and shot at the Fox Studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Plot As described in a film magazine, Armand Duval (Roscoe), a son in the proud but poor house of Duval, loves Camille (Bara), a notorious Parisian beauty. His love for Camille means that his sister Celeste (Whitney) cannot marry the man she loves, so the father goes to Camille and begs her to give Armand up, which she does. This arouses the anger of Armand and he denounces her one evening in public. The Count de Varville (Law) challenges Armand to a duel which he wins, wounding Armand in the arm. Believing Camille no longer loves him, Armand does not go to see her. One day his father tells him that Camille is dying. He goes to her and, after a few words, she dies in the arms of her lover.

It may be normally present in fish and frogs; it may be isolated from chronic infectious states, as in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients. In 1959, American bacteriologist Elizabeth O. King (who isolated Kingella kingae in 1960) was studying unclassified bacteria associated with pediatric meningitis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, when she isolated an organism (CDC group IIa) that she named Flavobacterium meningosepticum (Flavobacterium means \\"the yellow bacillus\\" in Latin; meningosepticum likewise means \\"associated with meningitis and sepsis\\"). In 1994, it was reclassified in the genus Chryseobacterium and renamed Chryseobacterium meningosepticum(chryseos = \\"golden\\" in Greek, so Chryseobacterium means a golden/yellow rod similar to Flavobacterium). In 2005, a 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree of Chryseobacteria showed that C. meningosepticum along with C. miricola (which was reported to have been isolated from Russian space station Mir in 2001 and placed in the genus Chryseobacterium in 2003) were close to each other but outside the tree of the rest of the Chryseobacteria and were then placed in a new genus Elizabethkingia named after the original discoverer of F. meningosepticum. Presence in plants Two species of Elizabethkingia have recently been found to be abundant on the leaf and root surfaces of the tropical tree Gnetum gnemon in Malaysia. Their role in the biology of the plant is unknown. Several other species of tropical trees studied did not have Elizabethkingia present on their leaves or roots, suggesting a host-specific relationship with Gnetum. Microbiology Under a microscope, E. meningoseptica appears as slender, slightly-curved rods which are nonmotile and are negative by Gram stain. They do not form spores, and require oxygen to survive. E. meningoseptica is positive by the catalase test, the oxidase test, and the indole test. It is negative by the urease test. In general, it is negative by the nitrate reductase test, although some strains are positive. E. meningoseptica grows well on blood agar and chocolate agar. Colonies are very pale yellow and may not be easily evident at 24 hours. Strains growing better at 40 ¬∞C are mostly associated with invasive meningitis. Often, a greyish discoloration is seen around the colonies on blood agar due to proteases and gelatinase. E. meningoseptica grows poorly on MacConkey agar and is considered a glucose oxidizer.Koneman's Color Atlas and Textbook of Diagnostic Microbiology Most strains do not grow on colistin nalidixic acid agar because, although they are resistant to colistin, they are susceptible to quinolones such as nalidixic acid. E. meningoseptica may show colistin-resistant and vancomycin-sensitive growth, which is paradoxic for a Gram-negative bacterium, but resembles Burkholderia cepacia, which is also a nonfermenter and does not grow well on MacConkey agar. These two can be distinguished by the indole test or the Pyr test, both of which should be clearly negative for B. cepacia and positive for E. meningoseptica. Automated bacterial identification system results should be observed with caution, especially when a patient with Gram- negative bacteremia does not improve with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, because several bacteria, including Aeromonas salmonicida (mistaken by ID32 GN) and Sphingobacterium spp. (mistaken by Vitek 2), may be confused with this bacterium, especially the atypical ones. However, unlike many other Aeromonas species such as A. hydrophilia and A. punctata, A. salmonicida is indole negative, which can help in distinguishing it in doubtful cases. An automated but so far relatively reliable Rapid NF plus system and API Zym systems use an array of biochemical tests for better identification of nonfermenters and other bacteria and can specifically identify E. meningoseptica. Infection E. meningoseptica predominantly causes outbreaks of meningitis in premature newborns and infants in neonatal intensive care units of underdeveloped countries. Some of the outbreaks have been linked to sources such as contaminated lipid stock bottles, contaminated venous catheter lines and nutritional solution, and tap water. The bacterium is also a rare cause of nosocomial pneumonia, endocarditis, postoperative bacteremia, and meningitis in immunocompromised adults. Only recently has it also been found to cause soft-tissue infection and sepsis in the immunocompetent and in a case of a fatal necrotizing fasciitis in a diabetic patient. Some 48 cases of Elizabethkingia infection resulting in 17 fatalities were reported in Wisconsin over a 5-month period beginning in November 2015.A Crash Course In Elizabethkingia, The Rare Bacterial Infection Spreading Across Wisconsin Antimicrobial susceptibility This bacterium is usually multiresistant to antibiotics typically prescribed for treating Gram-negative bacterial infections, including extended-spectrum beta-lactam agents (due to production by most strains of two betalactamases: one ESBL and one class B carbapenem- hydrolyzing metallolactamase), aminoglycosides, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Though vancomycin has been used in the past, its high Minimum inhibitory concentration (16 ¬µg/ml) has led to a search for alternatives, especially for meningitis. Presently, ciprofloxacin, minocycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin, and novobiocin are considered good alternatives. Most of these are classic drugs for Gram-positive bacteria and not routinely tested on Gram-negative bacteria. Predictors of poor outcome Hypoalbuminemia, increased pulse rate at the onset of infection, and central venous line infection were associated with a poor outcome. Resource persons At the 2006 meeting of the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes, the organization's subcommittee on the taxonomy of Flavobacterium and Cytophaga-like bacteria named J.-F. Bernardet and B. Bruun as two key authorities on this bacterium.

The differences between the two species are subtle. The male tail in C. briggsae has a slightly different morphology from C. elegans. Other differences include changes in vulval precursor competence and the placement of the excretory duct opening. C. briggsae is frequently used to study the differences between it and the more intimately understood C. elegans, especially at the DNA and protein sequence level. Several mutant strains of C. briggsae have also been isolated that facilitate genetic analysis of this organism.Nematode C. briggsae Research Resource C. briggsae, like C. elegans, is a hermaphrodite. The genome sequence for C. briggsae was determined in 2003.  History  C. briggsae was initially discovered by Margaret Briggs in 1944. The first individuals were isolated from a pile of leaves found on the Palo Alto campus of Stanford University. Briggs, who was studying for her MS, identified the nematodes as an unknown species of the genus Rhabditis.Ellsworth C Dougherty They were formally described in 1949 by Dougherty and Nigon and named Rhabditis briggsae. Both C. briggsae and C. elegans (then known as Rhabditis elegans) were placed into a new subgenus Caenorhabditis in 1952. The subgenus was later elevated to a genus in 1955. Briggs' initial work with the organism looked at its lifecycle in various kinds of media in the presence and absence of bacteria. She later used the organism in studies on the effects of antibiotics. This work was important in the development of axenic culture methods.  Habitat  C. briggsae can often be found in compost, garden beds, moist mushrooms, or rotting fruit rich with microorganisms and various nutrients. The organism's main habitat is often considered to be the temperate regions of the globe, often accompanying its relatives C. elegans and C. remanei.  Overview of genome  The genome of C. briggsae is roughly 100 Mb in size and is predicted to encode about 20,000 genes. The whole genome sequencing projectStein et al., 2003 revealed the genomes of C. briggsae and C. elegans to have much in common. For example, both worms have the same number of chromosomes (six), similar genome size, and similar numbers of protein coding and nonprotein coding genes. Further analysis demonstrated about 62% of the protein-coding genes in C. briggsae have orthologs in C. elegans. Nevertheless, many interesting species-specific features including genes exist, which serve as the foundation for comparative analysis.Genomics and biology of the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae  Comparative genomics  This species groups with C. nigoni in the 'Elegans' supergroup in phylogenetic studies. ; with C. elegans C. briggsae is a soil nematode estimated to have diverged from C. elegans around 80‚Äì100 million years ago, and yet is morphologically almost indistinguishable from it. Areas of sequence-encoding proteins are mostly conserved between the two species, while most intergenic and intronic sequences are divergent. Areas of similarity between the sequences of the two organisms can suggest coding exons or point to regulatory regions and to RNA genes missed in standard analysis.C. briggsae Project  References   External links  * briggsae Category:Nematodes described in 1949 ","title":"Caenorhabditis briggsae"},{"id":"8075982","text":"Sidyma (), was a town of ancient Lycia, at what is now the small village of Dudurga Asari in Muƒüla Province, Turkey. It lies on the southern slope of Mount Cragus, to the north-west of the mouth of the Xanthus.  History  Sidyma was mentioned in the 1st century BC by Alexander Polyhistor, and later by Pliny the Elder, Stephanus of Byzantium, the Synecdemus, and the Notitiae Episcopatuum. Its extant remains are of the time of the Roman Empire, when it was an unimportant but flourishing city, and no Lycian inscriptions have been discovered there and there are no Lycian rock tombs, but its name seems to indicate an earlier origin. Above the present ruins, which lie in a valley, is a wall that may indicate the existence on the hill of a city of which no traces remain.O.G.

It is related that the future Byzantine Emperor Marcian, when still a simple soldier, fell asleep while resting on a hunt near Sidyma, and was found to be sheltered by a large eagle, a presage of his future elevation.Explore Turkey, Lycia, Sidyma  Remains  The ruins of Sidyma, high up on the southern slope of Mount Cragus, were first discovered by Charles Fellows, who described them as consisting chiefly of splendidly built tombs, abounding in Greek inscriptions. The town itself, he said, appeared to have been very small, and the theatre, agora and temples, were of diminutive size, but of great beauty.C. Fellows, Lycia (1840) 151-56; E.

The title is a portmanteau of the French words rubrique (section) and bric-√†-brac. Initially published in Pilote magazine, the series was republished as five hardbound books between 1970 and 1974 by Dargaud, and again in 2002 as one volume, which also included previously unpublished content. It is widely regarded as one of the cornerstones of today's humorous bande dessin√©e. Style Rubrique-√†-Brac is an assortment of short (two to three pages) unrelated strips, drawn in black and white (although the 2002 re-publication was colorized). Its fairly realistic graphics contrast with the surreal, sometimes satirical humour of its textual content. The result is comparable to a graphical form of deadpan humour. The backgrounds are almost non-existent, and a large portion of the panels is occupied by elaborate dialogues. Rubrique-√†-Brac revisits an extremely wide range of subjects, such as historical figures, classic fairy tales, folklore, foreign countries and cultures, sport, the making of comics (in strips in which the author is often involved), movie and television clich√©s, music, youth and infancy (often in strips implicitly telling the author's life), science, or the various uses of everyday items and everyday life. One of the most recurrent subjects is broccoli: this vegetable recurs as a running gag in many conversations, always unjustifiably mentioned by characters. Recurring characters * Isaac Newton often appears in otherwise unrelated strips to be hit on the head by an unlikely object (among other things a seagull, a piano, a sloth, a button... not to mention his famous apple). This, of course, causes him to discover the law of universal gravitation. * The unnamed ladybug owes its existence to Gotlib's dislike of drawing backgrounds. He created this character as a way to fill up the blank space, and it is often seen in the bottom corner of panels, usually commenting on their content. * Professeur Burp is a zoologist who occasionally presents absurd pseudoscientific expositions on various animals and animal life (giraffe, hippopotamus, stag, pig, chameleon, kangaroo, hyena among the most outstanding and eccentric interpretations). * Charolles, a caricature of Gotlib himself, and Bougret (a caricature of G√©b√©) are two criminal bureau detectives. The suspects in their various investigations are always the same two men: Blondeau Georges Jacques Babylas, a caricature of Goscinny, and Aristid√®s Othon Fr√©d√©ric Wilfrid, a caricature of French cartoonist Fred. Although all evidence points to Aristid√®s, Blondeau is invariably found to be the culprit by Bougret, while Charolles is dumbfounded. * Gotlib himself appears in a number of his own strips, whether as the artist (thus breaking the fourth wall), or as an actual character.

Aerial photo: K√©tp√≥, palace Geography K√©tp√≥ town limit sign in Rovas script. K√©tp√≥ covers an area of and has a population of 820 people (2002). K√©tp√≥ is situated in the south-eastern part of J√°sz- Nagykun-Szolnok county near the villages of T√∫rkeve, Mez≈ët√∫r, T√∂r√∂kszentmikl√≥s, Kengyel, Mez≈ëh√©k, Tiszateny≈ë, and Kuncsorba. There are no natural streams. One of the branches of the Nagykuns√°g Main Channel is located at the border. History Prehistory and ancient history Palaeolithic man lived in the area, as found in excavations from Kengyel, T√∫rkeve, and T√∂r√∂kszentmikl√≥s. In ancient times, the settlement was a marginal part of the Sarmatians, as their line of defense is the forefront of the Cs√∂rsz trench. By indirect evidence, it is likely that the region played an important role in Attila's era, when it was a connection between the central campsite along the Tisza (perhaps the area of Szeged) and the eastern parts of the empire, as it was possible to turn to the passes of the uncharted Tisza to the northeast of the Carpathian Mountains for the first time. Age of Conquest Many archaeological finds were found in K√©tp√≥, probably Hungarians belonging to the Tarj√°n tribe led by Ond. The mass of the artifacts and the names of the settlements that existed and still exist in the area (Kisp√≥, Nagyp√≥, Pusztap√≥, P√≥hamara, P√≥halma) indicate that the vicinity of the settlement was an important neighborhood. There are a good number of Cumanian names (Kuns, Besenyi, Ulysses) among the people of the area and there are signs of their lives in the surrounding settlements. The area was barely suitable for farming due to its marshy nature, so it is likely that livestock and fishing were the primary products. And at a given time, these conditions are for the Bengal peoples. An outstanding archaeological find from this time is the K√©tp√≥ Cup, which proves that there was a prestigious headquarters in this place at the time of the conquest. √Årp√°d Age The tribal center was soon established as a settlement, first mentioned in the V√°radi Regestrum between 1208 and 1235. This is one of the oldest settlements in the county. The Tatar invasion depopulated this area. In 1240‚Äì42, B√©la with the introduction of the Kuns. At that time, the K√©tp√≥ area was one of the southernmost points of the Kun (apart from Kunszentm√°rton), which will play a role in the later religious system. At the turn of the 15th century, Sigismund of Luxembourg was fighting against the Turks for Belgrade, so he exchanged it, among others, in the head of the Twin Pole. The master of the estate became Gy√∂rgy Brankovics, a descendant of the Rascian despot, who had settled a large number of Serbian families in the area. At this time, two settlements have been registered under the name Kisp√≥ and Nagyp√≥. With their introduction, farming became more dominant in the area. Turkish times The area of Kisp√≥ and Nagyp√≥ was subject to the castle of T√∂r√∂kszentmikl√≥s, and it was noted that both villages had a church and about 200 to 300 inhabitants. The continual harassment of the Turks and the war with the Tatar troops depopulated the country, which was almost completed by the fifteen-year war between 1591 and 1606. The population started to return only after the peace-making, but the area of the settlements was recorded as a desert. Further losses were caused by the relocation of a significant part of the loyal population to Rakamaz after the failure of the R√°k√≥czi War of Independence. Desert period In the XVII-XIX centuries, the area of K√©tp√≥ was registered as a wilderness attached to Mez≈ët√∫r. Farm System Sheep herding was the primary agricultural activity, and animal husbandry was the driving force behind the establishment of accommodations and farms. As animal husbandry was gradually modernized and strengthened in the area of Mez≈ët√∫r, farmers also appeared in remote areas of the district, so the farm system also developed rapidly. By the end of the 19th century, the farmstead areas were organized according to the type of farming. In 1952, the village of K√©tp√≥ (about 1,400 inhabitants) was established from those living on homesteads in the area (nearly 4,000 people). The lands were considered to be very good, because instead of the average threefold, they had yielded five times the yield of each sown seed. Religion In terms of religion, K√©tp√≥ was similar to the other settlements of the Nagykuns√°g, where Roman Catholicism was weakly rooted, Eastern Christianity was more typical, and South Slavic settlement was further strengthened. This resulted in the rejection of Catholicism in the Reformation era and the rapid spread of the Reformed Faith.

In 1928, he teamed up with Australian cyclists, Hubert Opperman, Percy Osborn and Ernie Bainbridge. They were the first English-speaking team to ride the Tour de France. Early life and family Watson was born in 1904. His parents were George and Elsie Watson, who farmed on the Canterbury Plains. He was the oldest of four children; the next oldest was his brother Arthur, and the two youngest were sisters Gladys and Joy. The family shifted to Marshland on the northern outskirts of Christchurch to become market gardeners. There, they were neighbours with the Arnst family, who were equally sports-mad as all the Watson children. Jack Arnst (born 1883) was a champion cyclist, and his twin Richard \\"Dick\\" Arnst was a world champion rower. On 7 September 1926, Harry Watson married his neighbour Catherine Margaret \\"Kitty\\" Arnst (born 1905) at St Matthew's Church in St Albans.Marriage registration number 1926/10294 Her father, Charles William Arnst (born 1880), was an elder brother to Jack and Dick.Birth registration number 1880/10949 Cycling career The tour was long in 1928, most of it on unsealed roads, and the riders used heavy, fixed wheel bicycles. There were 22 stages, ranging from 119 kilometres to 387 kilometres. As the Australasians were relatively inexperienced (they had never raced in Europe before) and were a trade team of four competing against teams of 8 to 10 cyclists, the French media predicted they would only last a few stages before pulling out. Of the 168 starters that year, only 41 finished. Watson placed 28th. He stated afterwards that it was the toughest race he had ever completed: \\"When I think of the mountain climbing, the mad rushes downhill, and the riding at night in pitch darkness, well, it is a veritable nightmare! In spite of this, it was a wonderful experience racing the Continentals.\\" After eight months abroad Watson returned to New Zealand and continued competitive cycling to 1937. He won almost every long distance race that he entered, and set some enduring records in the process. The most notable was in 1935 when he completed the 167-kilometre Taranaki Around-the-Mountain Road Race in 4 hours, 8 minutes, 38 seconds (average speed of 40 km/h). Watson was selected for the 1928 Tour de France on the strength of his performance in the Dunlop Grand Prix, which at the time was the biggest cycling race in the British Empire and the richest race in the world. The race was held in four stages around Victoria in November 1927, covering . The Dunlop Grand Prix carried with it the title of Long Distance Road Champion of Australasia and Watson finished second to Opperman. Watson returned to Australia in 1934 for the Centenary 1000 a one-week race over seven stages covering to mark the Centenary of Victoria, a race which also carried the title of Long Distance Road Champion of Australasia. Watson was one of the 30 \\"A Grade\\" riders starting from scratch, finished 2nd in stage 2 from Warrnambool to Stawell over and finished second overall. Le Ride In July 2013, The Amazing Race host Phil Keoghan paid homage to Watson and the other riders of the 1928 Tour de France by retracing the ride route on bikes of the era.

The first proposed site was in Erdeven, Morbihan, but objections arose. EDF then proposed Ploumoguer, Finist√®re, just north of Brest. Councilmen around Brest redirected their attention to Plogoff. Local residents then blocked access to the site in 1976, while protests resumed in 1978 and 1979. In 1980, the national government and EDF attempted to fulfil their statutory obligations to display the required inquiry documents in the local mairie or city hall. Local officials burned the documents and refused to allow replacements to be displayed. In response, the national government set up mobile mairies annexes to display the documents in town centres. These mairies annexes became the focus of the protest movement. For 45 days, the riot police (CRS), the military police (gendarmerie) and some parachutists (EPIGN) guarded the mairies annexes while coming under attack from the protesters. Once the obligation to display the documents had been met, the protesters occupied the proposed site. In 1981 Fran√ßois Mitterrand was elected President of France. Mitterrand carried out his campaign promise to cancel the project.

The earliest form of railways, horse-drawn wagonways, originated in Germany in the 16th century. Soon wagonways were also built in Britain. However, the first use of steam locomotives was in Britain. The invention of wrought iron rails, together with Richard Trevithick's pioneering steam locomotive meant that Britain had the first modern railways in the world. Early rails A wagonway was used by German miners at Caldbeck, Cumbria, England, perhaps from the 1560s.Warren Allison, Samuel Murphy and Richard Smith, An Early Railway in the German Mines of Caldbeck in G. Boyes (ed.), Early Railways 4: Papers from the 4th International Early Railways Conference 2008 (Six Martlets, Sudbury, 2010), pp. 52‚Äì69. A wagonway was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, sometime around 1600, possibly as early as 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about half a mile away. Another wagonway was Sir Francis Willoughby's Wollaton Wagonway in Nottinghamshire built between 1603 and 1604 to carry coal. As early as 1671 railed roads were in use in Durham to ease the conveyance of coal; the first of these was the Tanfield Wagon Way. Many of these tramroads or wagon ways were built in the 17th. and 18th. centuries. They used simply straight and parallel rails of timber on which carts with simple flanged iron wheels were drawn by horses, enabling several wagons to be moved simultaneously. These primitive rails were superseded in 1767, when ironmaster Richard Reynolds probably for the first time replaced wooden rails with cast iron railsChapter 5 of Industrial Biography: Iron Workers and Tool Makers, by Samuel Smiles, at Project Gutenberg and in 1793 when the then superintendent of the Cromford Canal, Benjamin Outram, constructed a tramway with 'L'-shaped flanged cast- iron plate rails from the quarry at Crich: it was a little over a mile in length descending some and had a gauge of . Wagons fitted with simple flangeless wheels were kept on the track by vertical ledges, or plates. Cast- iron rails were a significant improvement over wooden rails as they could support a greater weight and the friction between wheel and rail was lower, allowing longer trains to be moved by horses. Outram's rails were superseded by William Jessop's cast iron edge rails where flanged wheels ran on the top edge of simple bar-shaped rails without the guiding ledges of Outram's flanged plate rails. The rails had been first employed in 1789 at Nanpantan at the Loughborough Charnwood Forest Canal. Such rails could be manufactured in lengths. Jessop, a former pupil of John Smeaton, became a partner with Outram in 1790 in the latter's Butterley ironworks. Cast iron rails had a propensity to break easily, and the short lengths soon became uneven. In 1820, John Birkenshaw introduced a method of rolling rails in greater lengths using wrought iron which was used from then onwards.

As railway technology developed, longer lines became possible, connecting mines with more distant transshipment points and promising lower costs. These longer lines often required public subscription to build and crossed over land not owned by the mine owners. As a result, they needed an Act of Parliament to build, to enforce the sale of wayleave by landowners. The Acts also protected investors from unrealistic, or downright fraudulent, schemes. The first line to obtain such an act, in 1758, was a private coal-owner's wagonway, the Middleton Railway in Leeds. The first for public use, and on cast iron rails, was the Lake Lock Rail Road formed in 1796 and opened in 1798. Another early public railway, the Surrey Iron Railway obtained an Act of Parliament on 21 May 1801 to build a tramroad between Wandsworth and Croydon in what is now south London; the engineer was William Jessop. Although it survived only until 1845 and was for freight traffic only, it prefaced many others in different parts of the country. Meanwhile, the first passenger-carrying public railway was the Oystermouth Railway, authorised in 1807. All three of these railways were initially worked by horses; the Surrey Iron Railway remained horse-drawn throughout its life. The Kilmarnock and Troon Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament on 27 May 1808 and was also built by William Jessop.. It was the first line in Scotland to carry passengers. The line began life as a gauge waggonway and at first it was operated by horses, but in 1817 locomotive haulage was trialled, using one of Stephenson's locomotives. This was the first use of a steam locomotive in Scotland.  Introduction of steam locomotives  Trevithick's steam circus on which the locomotive Catch Me Who Can ran Salamanca The first steam railway locomotive was introduced by Richard Trevithick in 1804. He was the first engineer to build a successful high-pressure stationary steam engine, in 1799. He followed this with a road going steam carriage in 1801. Although that experiment ended in failure, in 1802 the Coalbrookdale Company built a locomotive for him, but little is known about it, including whether or not it actually ran. In 1804, he built a successful unnamed rail going steam locomotive for the narrow gauge Merthyr Tramroad in South Wales (sometimes - but incorrectly - called the \\"Penydarren Tramroad\\"). The Penydarren locomotive used a high-pressure cylinder without a condenser, the exhaust steam being used to assist the draught via the firebox, increasing efficiency even more. These fundamental improvements in steam engine designs by Trevithick did not change for the whole of the steam era. Amid great interest from the public, on 21 February 1804 it successfully carried 10 tons of iron, 5 wagons and 70 men a distance of from Penydarren to Abercynon in 4 hours and 5 minutes, an average speed of nearly . This locomotive proved that steam traction was a viable proposition, although the use of the locomotive was quickly abandoned as it was too heavy for the primitive plateway track. A second locomotive, built for the Wylam colliery, also broke the track. Trevithick built a third locomotive in 1808, Catch Me Who Can, which ran on a temporary demonstration railway in Bloomsbury, London. Members of the public were able to ride behind at speeds up to . However, it again broke the rails and Trevithick was forced to abandon the demonstration after just two months.Science and Society Picture Library : 'Catch-Me-Who-Can', 1808 The first commercially successful steam locomotive was the twin cylinder Salamanca, built in 1812 by John Blenkinsop and Matthew Murray for the gauge Middleton Railway. Blenkinsop believed that a locomotive light enough to move under its own power would be too light to generate sufficient adhesion, so he designed a rack and pinion system for the line. This was despite the fact that Trevithick had demonstrated successful adhesion locomotives a decade before. The single rack ran outside the narrow gauge edge-rail tracks and was engaged by a cog-wheel on the left side of the locomotive. The cog-wheel was driven by two cylinders embedded into the top of the center-flue boiler. Four such locomotives were built for the railway, and they worked until the early 1830s. Stockton and Darlington Railway Puffing Billy The proprietors of Wylam Colliery, near Newcastle upon Tyne wanted to replace horse-drawn trains with steam. In 1804, William Hedley, a manager at the colliery, employed Trevithick to build a steam locomotive. However, it proved too heavy for the wooden track to allow it to be used. William Hedley and Timothy Hackworth (another colliery employee) designed a locomotive in 1813 which became known as Puffing Billy. Puffing Billy featured piston rods extending upwards to pivoting beams, connected in turn by rods to a crankshaft beneath the frames, which in turn drove the gears attached to the wheels. This meant that the wheels were coupled, allowing better traction. A year later George Stephenson, another of Wylam's employees, improved on that design with Bl√ºcher, which was the first locomotive to use flanged wheels to keep the locomotive on the track, and had cylinder rods directly connected to the wheels in the manner of Catch me who can. In 1821 an Act of Parliament was passed for a tramway between Stockton and Darlington. Stephenson's design convinced the backers of the proposed tramway to appoint Stephenson, who had recently built the Hetton colliery railway, as engineer. Traffic on the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&DR;) was originally intended to be horse- drawn, but Stephenson carried out a fresh survey of the route to allow steam haulage, and the Act was amended to allow the use of steam locomotives. The railway was also empowered to carry passengers in addition to coal and general merchandise. The line was in length, had 100 passing loops along its single track, and four branch lines to collieries. It opened on 27 September 1825. The first train was hauled by Stephenson's Locomotion No 1 at speeds of . Four locomotives named Locomotion were constructed; they were effectively beam engines on wheels with vertical cylinders. They were also amongst the first locomotives to use coupling rods rather than chains to drive their wheels. The railway was initially operated like a public road, and it was a common occurrence for waggoners' trains to meet on the single track, leading to arguments as to who should back up to a passing loop. Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway The first public steam railway in Scotland was the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway. An Act of Parliament authorising the railway was passed in 1824, and it opened in 1826 as a gauge, Scotch gauge, railway.Awdry, Christopher (1990). Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies. London: Guild Publishing Liverpool and Manchester Railway Stephenson's Rocket, preserved in the Science Museum, London The Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR;) was the world's first intercity passenger railway in which all the trains were timetabled and operated by steam locomotives. This differed from the Stockton and Darlington, as sections of this line employed cable haulage, and only the coal trains were hauled by locomotives. Further, horse-drawn traffic could use the Stockton and Darlington upon payment of a toll. The passenger-carrying Canterbury and Whitstable Railway opened three months before the L&MR.; However, it used cable haulage by stationary steam engines over much of its length, with steam locomotives restricted to the level stretch. The L&MR; was primarily built to provide faster transport of raw materials and finished goods between the port of Liverpool and mills in Manchester in north-west England. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company was founded on 24 May 1823. The line was a remarkable engineering achievement for its time, beginning with the Wapping Tunnel beneath Liverpool from the docks to Edge Hill. Following this was a long cutting, up to deep, through rock at Olive Mount, and a nine span arch viaduct over the Sankey Brook Valley, around high. There was also a crossing of the Chat Moss bog. Liverpool Road Station in Manchester To determine which locomotives would be suitable, the directors organised the Rainhill Trials. These were arranged as an open contest that would let them see all the locomotive candidates in action, with the choice to follow. A prize of ¬£500 was offered to the winner of the trials. The trials were won by Rocket, built by George and Robert Stephenson. Rocket was the first locomotive to use a multi-tubular boiler, which allowed more effective heat transfer from the exhaust gases to the water. It was also the first to use a blastpipe, where used steam from the cylinders discharges into the smokebox beneath the chimney in order to increase the draught of the fire. With these innovations, Rocket averaged , with a top speed of hauling 13 tons, and was declared the winner of the trials. The Stephensons were accordingly given the contract to produce locomotives for the Liverpool & Manchester Railway. The line opened on 15 September 1830 with termini at Liverpool Road, Manchester (now part of the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester) and Edge Hill, Liverpool.

The Pennines restricted canal development, so the railway provided a realistic alternative, especially with the growth in coal usage from the mines in the North East and Yorkshire. A number of lines were approved in the area, such as the Leeds and Selby Railway, in 1830, which would link the former to the port of Hull, via the River Ouse. While the L&MR; had not ousted the Lancashire canal system from the transport of goods, there was an unexpected enthusiasm for passenger travel. The financial success of these lines was beyond all expectations, and interests in London and Birmingham soon planned to build lines linking these cities together and with Liverpool and Manchester via the L&MR.; These two lines were the London and Birmingham (L&BR;), designed by Robert Stephenson, which ran from Euston Square, London, to Curzon Street, Birmingham; and the Grand Junction, engineered by Joseph Locke, which ran from Curzon Street to an end-on junction with the Warrington and Newton Line, a branch of the L&MR;, at Dallam, near Warrington in Cheshire. The Grand Junction was designed to link the existing L&MR; and the new L&BR; it opened on 4 July 1837, with the L&BR; following a few months later. Although Acts of Parliament allowed railway companies compulsory purchase of wayleave, some powerful landowners objected to railways being built across their land and raised objections in Parliament to prevent the bill from being passed. Some landowners charged excessive amounts, so these early lines did not always follow the optimal route. In addition, steep gradients were to be avoided as they would require more powerful locomotives, while since speeds were expected to be less than about 30 mph, curves were considered less of a problem. It was the curves on these early lines that, a century later, would lead to British Railways' experimentation with, and later introduction of, tilting trains.  Railway Mania  George Hudson Although the Government was in favour of the development of trunk railways to stimulate economic recovery and to facilitate the movement of troops in times of potential civil unrest, it was legally necessary that each line be authorised by a separate Act of Parliament. While there were entrepreneurs with the vision of an intercity network of lines, such as those through the East Midlands, it was much easier to find investors to back shorter stretches that were clearly defined in purpose, where rapid returns on investment could be predicted. The boom years were 1836 and 1845‚Äì47, when Parliament authorized 8,000 miles of lines at a projected cost of ¬£200 million, which was about the same value as the country's annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at that time. A new railway needed an Act of Parliament, which typically cost over ¬£200,000 (about $1 million) to obtain, but opposition could effectively prevent its construction. The canal companies, unable or unwilling to upgrade their facilities to compete with railways, used political power to try to stop them. The railways responded by purchasing about a quarter of the canal system, in part to obtain the right of way, and in part to buy off critics. Once an Act was obtained, there was little government regulation. The railways largely had exclusive territory, but given the compact size of Britain, this meant that two or more competing lines could connect major cities. George Hudson (1800‚Äì71) became the most important railway promoter of his time.A. J. Arnold, and S. McCartney, George Hudson: The Rise and Fall of the Railway King (2004) Called the \\"railway king\\" of Britain, Hudson amalgamated numerous short lines and set up a \\"Clearing House\\" in 1842 which rationalized the service by providing uniform paperwork and standardized methods for apportioning fares while transferring passengers and freight between lines, and loaning out freight wagons. He could design complex company and line amalgamations, and his activities helped to bring about the beginnings of a more modern railway network. In 1849 he exercised effective control over nearly 30% of the rail track then operating in Britain, most of it owned by four railway groups ‚Äì the Eastern Counties Railway, the Midland, the York, Newcastle and Berwick, and the York and North Midland ‚Äì before a series of scandalous revelations forced him out of office. The economic, railway, and accounting literatures have treated Hudson as an important figure in railway history, although concentrating largely on the financial reporting malpractices of the Eastern Counties Railway while Hudson was its chairman, which were incorporated into the influential Monteagle Committee Report of 1849. He did away with accountants and manipulated funds ‚Äì paying large dividends out of capital because profits were low ‚Äì but no one knew that until his system collapsed.Adrian Vaughan, Railwaymen, Politics and Money: The Great Age of Railways in Britain (1997) pp 102-12 Cheffins' Map of English & Scotch Railways, 1850|alt= All the railways were promoted by commercial interests; as those opened by the year 1836 were paying good dividends, financiers wanted to invest in them, and by 1845 over a thousand projected schemes had been put forward. This led to a speculative frenzy, following a common pattern: as the price of railway shares increased, more and more money was poured in by speculators, until the inevitable collapse in price. It reached its zenith in 1846, when no fewer than 272 Acts of Parliament setting up new railway companies were passed. Unlike most stock market bubbles, there was a net tangible result from all the investment in the form of a vast expansion of the British railway system, though perhaps at an inflated cost. When the government stepped in and announced closure for depositing schemes, the period of \\"Railway Mania\\", as it was called, was brought to an end. The commercial interests mentioned above were often of a local nature, and there was never a nationwide plan to develop a logical network of railways. Some railways, however, began to grow faster than others, often taking over smaller lines to expand their own. The success of the L&MR; led to the idea of linking Liverpool to London, and from that the seeds of the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;) ‚Äì an amalgamation of four hitherto separate enterprises, including the L&MR; ‚Äì were sown. Within 50 years the L&NWR; was to become \\"the biggest joint stock company in the world\\" . The legacy of the Railway Mania can still be seen today, with duplication of some routes and cities possessing several stations, sometimes with no direct connection between them, although a significant amount of this duplication was removed by the Beeching Axe in the 1960s. The best example of this is London, which has no fewer than twelve main line terminal stations serving its dense and complex suburban network, the result of the many railway companies that were competing during the Mania to run their routes in the capital. Government involvement The railway directors often had important political and social connections, and used it to their company's advantage. For example, the directors of the Great Western came from elite backgrounds and typically had political influence when they joined the board. When an issue came up with the government, they knew whom to see in London. Landed aristocrats were especially welcome on the corporate boards. The aristocrats saw railway directorships as a socially acceptable form of contact with the world of commerce and industry. They leveraged the business acumen and connections gained through railways to join corporate boardrooms in other industries.Geoffrey Channon, Railways in Britain and the United States, 1830-1940 (Ashgate 2001) pp 301-2. While it had been necessary to obtain an Act of Parliament to build a new railway, the government initially took a laissez faire approach to their construction and operation. The Government began to take an interest in safety matters, with the 1840 \\"Act for Regulating Railways\\", which empowered the Board of Trade to appoint railway inspectors. The Railway Inspectorate was established in 1840 to enquire after the causes of accidents and recommend ways of avoiding them. The first investigation was conducted by Colonel Frederic Smith into 5 deaths caused by a large casting falling from a moving train in 1840 (Howden rail crash). He also conducted an enquiry into the derailment on the GWR when a mixed goods and passenger train derailed on Christmas Eve, 1841. The train hit a landslide at Sonning (Railway accident at Sonning Cutting), killing 9 passengers. As early as 1844 a bill had been put before Parliament suggesting the state purchase of the railways; this was not adopted. It did, however, lead to the introduction to minimum standards for the construction of third-class carriages, an issue raised by the Sonning accident, which came to be known as \\"Parliamentary Carriages\\". \\"The Battle of the Gauges\\" Bristol Temple Meads, the GWR terminus George Stephenson built the L&MR; to the same gauge as the tramroads in use in the North Eastern colliery railways he had grown up working on: a rail gauge of , and all railways built by him and his assistants adhered to that gauge. When Bristol businessmen wished to build their railway linking their city with London, they chose Isambard Kingdom Brunel as their engineer. Brunel favoured a wider gauge of . He felt that the different railways would not be in close enough proximity to warrant adherence to a uniform British gauge. Thus, the Great Western Railway (GWR) (completed in 1841) was constructed to Brunel's 'broad' gauge. However, his assumption proved incorrect, and when railways of a different gauge met, the inconvenience led to an officiating organization looking into the matter. Their conclusion was that Stephenson's \\"narrow gauge\\" should be adopted as Britain's standard gauge, and Parliament passed the 1846 Gauge of Railways Act which stipulated the standard gauge of . The undaunted GWR pressed ahead into the West Midlands, in hard-fought competition with the London and North Western Railway. Birmingham was reached in 1852, at Snow Hill and Wolverhampton at Low Level (the furthest-north broad-gauge station) in 1854. The Bristol and Gloucester Railway had been bought by the Midland Railway in 1846 and converted to standard gauge in 1854, bringing mixed gauge track (with three rails, so that both broad and standard gauge trains could run on it) to Bristol. By the 1860s the gauge war was lost; with the merger of the standard-gauge West Midland Railway into the GWR in 1861 mixed gauge came to Paddington, and by 1869 there was no broad-gauge track north of Oxford. GWR Iron Duke Class broad gauge steam locomotives awaiting scrapping after broad gauge was abolished in 1892. Through this period the conversion to standard gauge continued, with mixed-gauge track reaching Exeter in 1876. By this time most conversions were bypassing mixed gauge and going directly from broad to standard. The final stretch of broad gauge on the national network was converted to standard in a single weekend in May 1892. There is one small exception: The Holyhead Breakwater Railway, laid for the construction of the breakwater, was constructed at the broad gauge. Construction finished in 1870, and one locomotive was sold to a local company which had its own sidings leading to the dock. It continued to work this isolated network until 1913 when it wore out and the network was regauged.  London  Euston station, showing the wrought iron roof of 1837. Note the open carriages By the 1850s, many steam-powered railways had reached the fringes of built-up London (which was much smaller than now). But the new lines were not permitted to demolish enough property to penetrate the City or the West End, so passengers had to disembark at Paddington, Euston, King's Cross, Fenchurch Street, Charing Cross, Waterloo or Victoria and then make their own way via hackney carriage or on foot into the centre, thereby massively increasing congestion in the city. The Metropolitan Railway was built under the ground to connect several of these separate railway terminals. It opened in 1863, and was the first line of what was to become the London Underground. Marylebone was connected to the Bakerloo line in 1907, however Fenchurch Street was never connected to the system - a peculiarity that remains to the present day.  Early successes  Railways in 1898 The financial success of the early railways was phenomenal, as they had no real competition. The roads were still very slow and in poor condition. Prices of fuel and food fell in cities connected to railways owing to the fall in the cost of transport. The layout of lines with gentle gradients and curves, originating from the need to help the relatively weak engines and brakes, was a boon when speeds increased, avoiding for the most part the need to re-survey the course of a line. Less than 20 years after the Liverpool line opened, it was possible to travel from London to Scotland by train, in a small fraction of the former time by road. Towards the end of the 19th century, competition became fierce between companies on the east and west coast routes to Scotland, leading to the \\"Race to the North\\". By 1923 there were some nine major railways operating in England and five in Scotland. In addition there were smaller companies, such as the Cambrian Railways and the many South Wales lines; the Furness and Hull and Barnsley Railways in England; and many much smaller lines. A brief note about each of the larger companies will illustrate how they grew to the importance they had assumed by the time of the huge amalgamations which took place in 1923, in which all but a very few railways were absorbed. Each of the railways described briefly below have their own article.  Major pre-grouping railway companies in Great Britain   English railways  ; Great Central Railway (GCR) : the GCR developed from the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, which was formed from an amalgamation of various existing and proposed lines in the North and East Midlands. The MS&LR; system was based around an east-west Trans-Pennine route, but in 1897 it began a new line via the East Midlands into London to a new terminus at Marylebone, and was renamed the GCR. It was the last major main line to be built in Britain, and was consequently engineered to a higher standard than earlier lines. After the opening of the London Extension in 1899, the GCR served an area between the East and West Coast main lines (see below), in competition with several other companies, especially the Midland Railway. After nationalisation the GCR network was effectively dismantled, leaving the East Midlands served only by the older Midland main line. Only the Marylebone to Birmingham section survives today. Great Eastern Railway locomotive, c. 1902 ; Great Eastern Railway (GER) : the GER was an amalgamation in 1862 of the Eastern Counties Railway with several smaller East Anglian lines; it also absorbed the Northern and Eastern Railway in 1902. It served the eastern counties of England: Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk, as well an extensive suburban network in East London and Essex. It was one of the few pre-Grouping companies (another being the North Eastern Railway) to have a near monopoly of its territory. Its main London terminus was Liverpool Street. ; Great Northern Railway (GNR) : the GNR began as an amalgamation in 1846 of two rival schemes: the London and York Railway and the Direct Northern Railway (both started in 1844). The GNR main line ran northwards from King's Cross to a joint station with the NER at Doncaster. Other lines served Lincolnshire and Derby Friargate. The GNR also had joint ownership of the Cheshire Lines Committee, giving access to Liverpool; other joint workings led to West Yorkshire (Leeds and Halifax); and it part-owned, with the Midland Railway, the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, serving parts of East Anglia. The GNR, with the NER and the NBR, operated the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh. ; Great Western Railway (GWR) : the GWR was incorporated in 1835 to construct a railway, operated on the broad gauge of , between Bristol and London. With the addition of several railways - including the Bristol and Exeter Railway (1876); South Wales Railway (1863); West Midland Railway (1863); South Devon Railway (1878); and the Cornwall Railway (1889) - the GWR territory took shape. The major routes, apart from the original line, served Weymouth, Plymouth and Penzance to the west; all of South Wales to Fishguard and Aberystwyth; Birmingham and Chester to the north-west. A working agreement with the LNWR extended the Chester line to Birkenhead on Merseyside. The broad gauge system resulted in what became known as the Gauge War: despite the technical advantages of broad gauge, it caused problems wherever the GWR met other companies' tracks, and eventually (in 1892) the last broad gauge line was abolished. The name \\"Great Western Railway\\", alone of all the pre-Grouping companies, was retained until the nationalisation of the railways; and one of the post-British Rail train operating companies now bears the name in 2005. Manchester Victoria station, built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway ; Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) : the L&YR; was incorporated in 1847; as with all the major railways it was the result of amalgamations, in this instance the Manchester and Leeds Railway which in 1859 joined the East Lancashire Railway to form the L&YR.; Its lines covered the two counties, and served amongst others Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Preston, Doncaster and Goole. In 1922 the L&YR; was combined with the LNWR, the Midland, and others, in the LMSR. ; London and North Western Railway (LNWR) : the LNWR was formed in 1846 when four existing lines were amalgamated: the London and Birmingham Railway; the Liverpool and Manchester Railway; the Grand Junction Railway; and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway, making the LNWR the largest in the country at that time [420 miles (672 km)]. By 1923 its main line stretched from Euston station in London to Carlisle, with branches to Oxford and Cambridge; to Peterborough; and from Crewe to North Wales and West Yorkshire. It had running powers to enable its trains to reach Swansea and other parts of South Wales; and it also owned a railway in Ireland. The LNWR, together with the Caledonian Railway, operated the West Coast Main Line between London and Glasgow. ; London and South Western Railway (LSWR) : Promoted as the London and Southampton Railway, the first section opened in 1838. By 1923 its main line extended from Waterloo in London via Woking, Basingstoke and Winchester to Southampton, Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth. It also operated a main line from Waterloo via Guildford to Portsmouth (the \\"Portsmouth Direct line\\"), and another via Salisbury and Exeter to Plymouth running parallel to, but south of, the GWR main line. This route, known as \\"the Withered Arm\\", extended into Devon and Cornwall serving many of the south and south-west seaside resorts, served by what was known as the Atlantic Coast Express. The LSWR also had a busy suburban network in south-west London. The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway was jointly owned with the Midland Railway. London Victoria station, used by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway ; London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) : the LB&SCR; began as the London and Croydon Railway (opened in 1839) and the London and Brighton Railway (1840). Its network of lines covered a large portion of the South London suburbs and served almost the whole of the county of Sussex, much of Surrey and some extensions into Kent and Hampshire. Many of the south coast resorts owe their existence to the line. Electrification began in 1909 on the overhead system; this was later changed to third rail when the LB&SCR; became part of the Southern Railway. ; Midland Railway (MidR) : the MidR was formed in 1844 with the amalgamation of three railways: the North Midland Railway; the Midland Counties Railway, and the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway. In its early days it had no London terminus, using termini of other railways (the LNWR and the GNR) until 1862, when its grandiose London terminus at St Pancras was built. By 1923 its main lines ran from St Pancras to Carlisle, via Nottingham and Sheffield, and via Derby (the MidR headquarters) to Manchester. It also had a secondary main line from Derby through Birmingham to Bristol. It part-owned the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, serving east coast ports and resorts; the Somerset and Dorset Railway (with the L&SWR;); and had access using other joint railways to reach Swansea in South Wales, Liverpool, and the port of Stranraer in Scotland. The latter route gave it access to its ownership of two of the Irish railways. Newcastle Central Station, built by the North Eastern Railway ; North Eastern Railway (NER) : the NER was formed in 1854 as the amalgamation of three railways: the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway; the York and North Midland Railway; and the Leeds Northern Railway. Since it eventually included the Stockton and Darlington line, it was the successor to the first public steam railway in the world. At the time of the Grouping its main line ran from the joint station at Doncaster, through York and Newcastle-on-Tyne to Berwick- on-Tweed. It formed part of the East Coast Main Line, and its headquarters were at York. It had a larger tonnage of mineral and coal traffic at the beginning of the 20th century than any other railway in Britain. ; South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&CR) : the SE&CR was a so-called working union in 1899 of two railways in the south east of England; the South Eastern Railway (opened in 1842) and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (1859). Like the LB&SCR and the L&SWR, it had a large suburban traffic base and served many of the south east coast seaside resorts. As a result of merging the two networks it had more London termini than any other company: London Bridge and Victoria (both shared with LB&SC), Charing Cross, Blackfriars and Holborn Viaduct. Its main lines ran from these termini via Maidstone or Tonbridge, and Ashford, to Ramsgate, Dover, Folkestone and Hastings. Scottish railways ; The Caledonian Railway: Originally formed to provide the main railway line between Carlisle and Edinburgh and Glasgow. It later merged with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway, which had opened in parts between July 1840 and March 1841. Together with the LNWR it operated the West Coast Main Line train services between London and Glasgow, and to Edinburgh, via Carstairs. ; The Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;): First section opened 1850. Formed by a merger of the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway, which had opened in parts between August 1839 and August 1840, and the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway. Later took over the Ardrossan and Johnstone Railway, which had in part opened in 1831; it then became the Ardrossan Railway in July 1840 and was reopened in August 1840 after a change of gauge from Scotch gauge to Standard gauge. The Paisley and Renfrew Railway, which had opened on 3 April 1835 as Scotch gauge railway, was also taken over and converted to Standard gauge. ; The Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) (1854) : Serving the north east of Scotland from Aberdeen. ; The Highland Railway (1865) : Main line northwards from Perth to Inverness with branches to Kyle of Lochalsh, Wick and Thurso. ; The North British Railway (NBR) (1846) : Serving the Scottish Lowlands into Fifeshire, and the west coast to Mallaig. It took over the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, which opened July 1842, and the West Highland Railway, which opened 1894 and was extended to Mallaig in 1901. :: For further details see List of early British railway companies  References   General     * English Railways        * Scottish Railways     1830 ","title":"History of rail transport in Great Britain 1830‚Äì1922"},{"id":"8076216","text":"Modesto P.

The period includes the investment following World War I; the rise in competition from the roads in the 1920s; development of steam locomotives capable of sustained 100 mph (160 km/h) running; the Great Depression of the 1930s; World War II and its aftermath; and the lead up to nationalisation during 1947.  Background  During the First World War the railway network was taken under government control and run by the Railway Executive Committee of the Government. This revealed some advantages in running the railways with fewer companies, and after the war it was widely agreed that the required development of the rail network could not be achieved under the conditions that had existed before the war. The nationalisation of the railways, which had been mooted by William Ewart Gladstone as early as the 1830s, was considered, but was rejected by the government and the owners of the rail companies. A compromise was created in the Railways Act 1921. Under this act, almost all of the hundreds of existing rail companies were grouped together into four new companies: * London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) * Great Western Railway (GWR) * London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) * Southern Railway (SR) This \\"grouping\\" had first been proposed in the 1850s, and lasted from 1 January 1923 to 31 December 1947. (See also List of railway companies involved in the 1923 grouping). Some lines remained outside this grouping, particularly those operated as Joint railways ‚Äì such as the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway and the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The four companies were and are referred to as \\"The Big Four\\". Although not in direct competition with each other over most of their routes, the Big Four competed to be the fastest, most modern and most comfortable, spurred on by increasing competition from road transport. Products of this competition were the LMS and LNER races to Scotland, with the famous Flying Scotsman service and LNER's Mallard setting a world speed record of 126 mph, the LMS's production of diesel railcars, electrification of lines by the LNER, the GWR's ingenious marketing and the SR's mass electrification scheme, which led to nearly the whole of the south east's trains being electric. Many claimed Britain had the best railways in the world at this period, and it could certainly be justified.  Competition from the roads  Road transport grew rapidly during the 1920s, stimulated by the cheap sale of thousands of war- surplus vans and lorries and the subsidised construction of new roads, which was mainly funded by local authorities. The revenues of the railway companies suffered because of the loss of freight to road haulage in particular. This was largely because the Government would not release the railways from their obligations as 'common carriers', which had been brought in the 19th century. It obliged railway companies to carry any cargo offered to it at a nationally agreed charge, which was usually well below a rate necessary to make the operation profitable for the railways. The intention had been to stop railway companies \\"cherry picking\\" the most profitable freight whilst refusing to carry less profitable freight. This had been a necessary measure when railways had had an effective monopoly over land transport. But with road competition encroaching, it put the railways at a disadvantage, because they had to subsidise unprofitable freight operations with profitable ones, which drove up charges. The road haulage operators, who had no such restrictions, could privately negotiate any rate they wished to undercut the railways' published price lists, and take away their business while offering door-to-door delivery. The railway companies had previously relied on horse-drawn trailers for local goods deliveries from the station; to compete they bought in motorised local delivery vehicles such as the Karrier 'Cob' and Scammell 'Mechanical Horse'. It was then thought that no large railway could operate at a profit unless more than half of its traffic was freight, and thus any reduction in the freight business would also affect the viability of the passenger business. A Royal Commission on Road and Rail Transport in 1931 was ineffectual at producing a solution. However, the subsequent Salter Report of 1933 was adopted as government policy; the Ministry of Transport lifted some of the restrictions on the railways while introducing licensing and safety regulations on hauliers. Against a storm of protest, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain, significantly increased vehicle excise duty so that all motor vehicles would pay the whole cost of the annual Road Fund. However just as the campaign looked like being successful, World War II started. The common carrier requirement was lifted by Transport Act 1962.  Changes and developments  With the transport policy pursued by the government, and more general changes in lifestyle favouring travel by road, the Big Four railways never ran a healthy profit. Indeed, the LNER never made a profit at all. However, they were still able to produce the world-leading services on the East Coast Main Line, running trains at speeds of up to 110 mph, a remarkable achievement. Also the SR invested heavily in electrification of all its lines, and this electrification was done at a far faster rate than at any time under BR. In the 16 years before the outbreak of World War II, the new companies set about the tremendous task of rebuilding railways which had had little or no work done since the end of World War I hostilities in 1918. Priority was new rolling stock: locomotives, coaches and wagons. As an example of the need for rationalisation, the LMSR took over 10,316 steam locomotives at the grouping: these comprised no fewer than 393 different classes. In the 1920s, the companies produced some exceptional locomotives: * LMSR: Royal Scot class 4-6-0 (1927); Sir Henry Fowler was Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) * LNER: A4 Pacific 4-6-2 (1935) (world steam speed record holder); A3 Pacific class 4-6-2 (1927); B17 Sandringham class 4-6-0 (1928); Sir Nigel Gresley CME * GWR: Castle class 4-6-0 (1923); King class 4-6-0 (1927); Hall class 4-6-0 (1928): Charles B. Collett CME * SR: King Arthur class 4-6-0 (1925); Lord Nelson class 4-6-0 (1926); R.E.L. Maunsell CME In addition to those mainly passenger locomotives, many new classes of freight engines were produced: the pannier tank locomotives of the GWR and the Garratt heavy freight 2-6-0+0-6-2 locomotive of the LMS (although the latter were not a huge success and only a few were built) being two examples. Total length of the British railways at 1 January 1923 was 19,585 route miles (31,336 km). From the end of the 1920s, when it was obvious that the motor vehicle was in the ascendancy, dozens of little-used branch lines began to close: some to passenger traffic, many completely. Although few railways were constructed, some new works were undertaken. Among them were: * Station redevelopments (notably those at Manchester and Paddington) * Lines to allow easier running ‚Äì one example being those on the Isle of Thanet * The Southern Railway began a programme of main- line electrification, which was to bring fast services to many of the south coast resorts, and to extend the London suburban routes.  World War II and its aftermath  During World War II the railway companies' managements joined together, effectively becoming one company. The railways were used more heavily than at any time in their history during this period. The railway system suffered heavy damage in some areas due to German Luftwaffe bombing, especially in cities such as London and Coventry. 482 locomotives, 13,314 passenger and 16,132 freight vehicles were damaged. However this damage was not as extensive as it was in many other European countries such as France and Germany. This unwittingly worked to the railways' disadvantage, because in other European countries the damage to their railway systems had been so bad that it gave them an opportunity to essentially re-build their railway systems from scratch, and dramatically modernise them. During the war very little was invested in the railways and they became increasingly run-down. With only essential maintenance work being carried out during the war, the maintenance backlog increased even further. Rolling stock also began to deteriorate. After the war, it was clear that the rail network could not be maintained in the private sector. According to a calculation by the Central Statistical Office during the period 1938‚Äì1953 the railways suffered a net disinvestment of ¬£440 million (around ¬£11 billion in 2005 prices)  The Big Four   London, Midland and Scottish Railway  The LMS claimed to be the world's largest joint stock organisation, the largest transport organisation, and the largest commercial undertaking in Europe (although they did not say on what basis), including the largest chain of hotels. In 1938, the LMS operated over 7,100 route miles (11,400 km) of railway across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, it was not very profitable, with a rate of return of only 2.7%. The principal LMS trunk routes were the West Coast Main Line and the Midland Main Line, which linked London, the industrial Midlands and North- West of England, and Scotland. The railway's main business was the transport of freight between these major industrial centres, rather than passengers. The early history of the LMS was dominated by infighting between its two largest constituents, the Midland and the North Western, previously two fierce rivals. Generally, the Midland way prevailed, with the adoption of many Midland practices, such as the livery of crimson lake for passenger locomotives and rolling stock as well as the continuation of the Midland Railway's small engine policy. The arrival of the new Chief Mechanical Engineer William Stanier heralded a change in the LMS, introducing new ideas rather than continuing with the company's internal conflict.  London and North Eastern Railway  LNER number 4468 Mallard The LNER covered the arc of the country between north and east of London. This included the East Coast Main Line from London to Edinburgh via York and Newcastle upon Tyne, as well as the routes from Edinburgh to Aberdeen and Inverness. It also included most of the country east of the Pennines, plus East Anglia. The total route mileage was 6590 miles (10,605 km). The LNER's main workshops were in Doncaster. The LNER hauled more than one-third of Britain's coal, and derived two-thirds of its income from freight services. Despite this, the main image that the LNER presented of itself was one of glamour, of fast trains and sophisticated destinations. The LNER's advertising campaign was highly sophisticated and advanced compared with those of its rivals. Top graphic designers and poster artists such as Tom Purvis were employed to promote its services and encourage the public to visit the holiday destinations of the east coast during the summer. The first chief mechanical engineer of the LNER was Sir Nigel Gresley, who held the post for most of the LNER's life. He was noted for his \\"Big Engine\\" policy, and is best remembered for his large express passenger locomotives, many times the holder of the world speed record for steam locomotives. LNER Class A4 4-6-2 Pacific locomotive Mallard still holds the land speed record for a steam locomotive. Gresley died in office in 1941.  Great Western Railway  5034 Corfe Castle fresh from the Swindon works The GWR was the only one of the big four to take its name from a predecessor. Its total route length was 3800 miles (6116 km), much of which had been built to handle the coal traffic from south Wales. Though this appeared to be a great coup for the GWR, the coal traffic declined significantly as the use of coal as a naval fuel declined, and within a decade the GWR was itself the largest single user of Welsh coal. The 1920s also saw the introduction of the GWR's most famous locomotives ‚Äì the Castle and King classes developed by C. B. Collett. The 1930s brought hard times, and the records set by the Castles and Kings were surpassed by other companies, but the company remained in relatively good financial health despite the Depression. In 1933, the Great Western Railway introduced the first of what was to become a successful series of railcars, which survived in regular use until they were replaced by British Railways in the 1960s. The original design featured 'air-smoothed' bodywork, which was very much the fashion at the time. The rounded lines of the first examples built lead to their nickname of \\"flying banana\\". Later examples had much more angular (and practical) bodywork, yet the nickname persisted for these too.  Southern Railway  EMU that ended up as a BR Class 404 The Southern Railway was geographically the smallest of the Big Four, and had 2,186 route miles (3518 km). Confined to the south of England, it owned no track north of London. Unlike the rest of the Big Four, the Southern Railway was predominantly a passenger railway. Despite its small size it carried more than a quarter of the UK's total passenger traffic. This is because the area covered by the railway included many of the dense commuter lines around London, as well as serving some of the most densely populated parts of the country. The Southern Railway was particularly successful at promoting itself to the public. \\"Sunny South Sam\\" became a character fixed firmly in the public mind as embodying the service of the railway, whilst slogans such as \\"live in Kent and be content\\" encouraged commuters to move out from London, and thus further patronise the services offered by the railway. The Southern Railway had a strong commitment to electrification. The intensively used commuter system in a relatively small geographical area made the Southern a natural candidate for electrification. After the Grouping, the LSWR's 660 V DC third rail system was adopted for the whole region. LSWR metro area was initially electrified, soon followed by conversion LBSCR's 6.6kV AC Overhead electrified London Metro lines and then the SECR's metro lines around London in the 1920s. The 1930s saw mainline electrification of the Brighton Main Line and the Portsmouth Direct Line with associated several surround lines (such as the East and West Coastways). Outer suburban electrification was also extensive (e.g. to Gillingham, Maidstone, etc.). Proposal existed for further to the Kent Coast but the war halted these plans. Originally, only electric multiple unit trains were used, but later electric locomotives and electro-diesel hybrids were developed. During World War II, the Southern found itself at the front line. Before hostilities, 75% of SR traffic was passenger with just 25% being freight. During the war, roughly the same number of passengers was carried, but only made up 40% of total traffic ‚Äì freight traffic had increased 4.5-fold. A shortage of freight locomotives was remedied by Chief Engineer Oliver Bulleid, who designed a 0-6-0 locomotive, the SR Class Q1. This was the largest 0-6-0 to operate in Britain, and forty of these transformed the Southern's ability to haul heavy freight.

He sat immediately below the presiding officer in the Senate chamber, providing information on precedents and advising other senators on parliamentary procedure. He is famous for discussions of the censures of Joseph McCarthy and Thomas Dodd, the contested election between John A. Durkin and Louis Wyman, and the preparations for a planned impeachment trial of Richard Nixon. He is also famous for advocating the change in the rules of cloture. Early life Floyd M. Riddick was born in Trotville, North Carolina in an agrarian area. His father was a farmer and merchant who did not finish primary school. Floyd Riddick's ancestor, Lemuel Riddick, was one of the signers of the Stamp Act passed by the House of Burgesses of Virginia. Riddick's family lived in a village, Gatesville, North Carolina. After his father became ill, in 1928, Riddick moved to Suffolk, Virginia. After finishing high school, Floyd M. Riddick attended Duke University and received the Bachelor of Arts degree. He was originally majoring in pre-law but then switched his major to political science after a talk with an influential professor, Robert Rankin. He then received a Masters Degree at Vanderbilt University in 1932, and returned to Duke to receive his Ph.D. in political science in 1935. While researching his doctoral dissertation, he spent a year observing the workings of the United States House of Representatives, a study which he eventually expanded and published as Congressional Procedure in 1941. Career and death After moving to Washington, D.C., he first worked as a statistical analyst for the FERA, and then for the Resettlement Administration. He then continued his congressional research interests, as an instructor of political science at American University from 1936 to 1939. He then received a position as an editor of the Congressional Daily for Congressional Intelligence, Inc., from 1939 to 1943. From 1943 to 1947, he edited the Legislative Daily for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He was then invited to establish a \\"Daily Digest,\\" in the Congressional Record. From 1947 to 1951, he was Senate editor of \\"Daily Digest\\", a synopsis of Congressional events which continues as a handy guide to the daily Record. He then joined the office of the parliamentarian, where he worked for 24 years. His work has appeared in the American Political Science Review and Western Political Quarterly. From 1951 to 1964, Riddick served as the Assistant Senate Parliamentarian. Floyd M. Riddick succeeded Charles Watkins as the Senate Parliamentarian in 1964, and held that position until 1974. As parliamentarian emeritus, he remained as a consultant to the United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. Floyd M.

Early life and education Geringer was born and raised on a farm in Wheatland, Wyoming. His father, Gottlieb Geringer, was a Volga German from Lauwe (now Yablonovka, Saratov Oblast) in the Russian Empire, and his mother, Edla Malin (n√©e Johnson), was of Swedish descent. He attended Kansas State University and was a member of Triangle Fraternity, earning a degree in mechanical engineering. He served for ten years in the United States Air Force before retiring. He briefly worked at a power generating station in Wheatland before purchasing a farm. Politics In 1982, Geringer successfully ran as a Republican for a seat in the Wyoming House of Representatives. After serving there for six years, he won a seat in the Wyoming Senate from the 3rd district. In 1994, Geringer was elected as Wyoming's governor. Geringer was generally a conservative throughout his political career. As governor, he helped pass laws that regulated class action lawsuits, reformed bankruptcy laws, toughened crime laws, legalized charter schools, and lowered taxes. However, he broke with the Republican Party in supporting environmental rulings and the Equal Rights Amendment. In 1997, Governor Geringer called for a boycott of America Online after Sondra London posted a series of murder confessions sent to her from \\"Happy Face Killer\\" Keith Jesperson, protesting that he found the items to be offensive. Although London voluntarily removed the pages in question, AOL banned her from the AOL domain, which in turn prompted an outpouring of support from all over the World Wide Web, including multiple offers of free server space.

The railway system in this period underwent modernisation, reorganisation and rebranding, some of which proved controversial. The use of steam locomotives on the network also ended in this period. Due to falling passenger numbers, rail subsidies from the government were necessary to keep the railways financially viable. Concerns about the levels of these contributed to the Beeching cuts which closed down many less well used lines. The 1940s: Nationalisation British Rail filmstrip showing how the railways were unified under BR. The Transport Act 1947 nationalised nearly all forms of mass transport in Great Britain and came into effect on 1 January 1948. British Railways came into existence as the business name of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission (BTC) on 1 January 1948 when it took over the assets of the Big Four railway companies. A few independent light railways and industrial railways, which did not contribute significant mileage to the system, were not included in British Railways; nor the Glasgow Underground and London Underground, already both public concerns, the Liverpool Overhead Railway, and non-railway-owned tramways. The Northern Counties Committee lines owned by the London, Midland & Scottish Railway were sold to the Northern Ireland government, becoming part of the Ulster Transport Authority as a result of the Ireland Act 1949. Under the BTC's Railway Executive, the railways were organised into six regions: * Eastern Region (ER) ‚Äì LNER lines south of Shaftholme Junction, Doncaster (region later amalgamated with the North Eastern Region) * North Eastern Region (NER) ‚Äì LNER lines in England north of Shaftholme Junction (region later amalgamated with the Eastern Region) * London Midland Region (LMR) ‚Äì LMS lines in England and Wales. * Scottish Region (ScR) ‚Äì LMS and LNER lines in Scotland * Southern Region (SR) ‚Äì Southern Railway lines * Western Region (WR) ‚Äì Great Western Railway lines The first priority of the new British Railways Board was to repair the infrastructure of the railways damaged by bombing, clear the backlog of maintenance that had built up, and make good losses in locomotives and rolling stock. The 1950s: Modernisation By the start of the 1950s, British Railways were making a working profit, albeit a small one. However, Britain had fallen well behind the rest of Europe in terms of dieselisation and electrification of its railways. There were political as well as practical reasons behind the resistance to dieselisation in particular: the Labour Government of Clement Attlee did not want to significantly reduce the demand for domestically-produced coal in favour of imported oil, thus both affecting the balance of payments and potentially causing unemployment. Robin Riddles, who was effectively the British Railways' Chief Mechanical Engineer, disagreed with the dieselisation programme, arguing that it would be too expensive to import oil given the large amounts of domestically available coal. He continued to order steam locomotives on a large scale and from 1948 to 1953, 1,487 steam locomotives were built.Gourvish, British Railways, p. 87. Although the initial focus was on repairing and renewing, some pre-war capital investment schemes that had stopped upon the outbreak of hostilities were restarted, for example the Manchester‚ÄìSheffield‚ÄìWath electrification over the Woodhead route and the Great Eastern suburban electrification. The new BR regions, formed largely around the management structures of the old \\"Big Four\\" companies, remained autonomous in terms both of organisation and production of locomotives and rolling stock, mostly continuing with pre-war designs ‚Äì indeed, some designs were even older: the workhorse LNER Class J17 was designed in 1898. As a whole, the equipment of the new British Railways was outdated, often unreliable, and mostly in urgent need of a refurbishment. Only the Southern Region with its large electrified suburban network in South London inherited from the Southern Railway operated a significant number of non-steam-powered trains. In 1951, the British Transport Commission approved a new series of standard locomotives and coaches incorporating design features primarily from the London, Midland & Scottish Railway but also the other pre- nationalisation companies. These standard designs were designed to be long- lasting but in the event few served to their full potential before being withdrawn during the 1960s. By the middle of the decade, however, it was clear that British Railways were in trouble, particularly in the freight haulage business to which they were losing ground to road and air traffic (the latter thanks to a postwar glut of available transport aircraft). The government ordered a review. The Modernisation Plan Class 47 loco No.47100 with the trademark Stratford TMD silver roof The report formally known as Modernisation and Re-Equipment of the British Railways, more commonly the \\"Modernisation Plan\\", was published in December 1954. It was intended to bring the railway system up to date. A government White Paper produced in 1956 stated that modernisation would help eliminate BR's financial deficit by 1962. The aim was to increase speed, reliability, safety and line capacity, through a series of measures which would make services more attractive to passengers and freight operators, thus recovering traffic that was being lost to the roads. The total cost of the Plan was projected to be ¬£1.24 million (approximately ¬£29 billion in 2020). The important areas were: * Electrification of principal main lines, in the Eastern Region, Kent, Birmingham and Central Scotland; * Large-scale dieselisation to replace steam locomotives; * New passenger and freight rolling stock; * Resignalling and track renewal; * Closure of small number of lines which were seen as unnecessary in a nationalised network, as they duplicated other lines; * Building of large freight marshalling yards, with automated shunting to streamline freight handling. However many railway historians including Christian Wolmar, Henshaw and others now regard it as a costly failure and a missed opportunity. An attempt was made to simply update the railways as they already stood rather than reacting to changes in the way goods and people were travelling in the post-war years. Massive investments were made in marshalling yards at a time when the small wagonload traffic which they dealt with was in steep decline and being lost rapidly to the roads. The Modernisation Plan called for the large-scale introduction of diesel locomotives: a total of 2,500 locomotives for mainline service to be procured in 10 years at a cost of ¬£125 million (¬£3 billion in 2020), plus the replacement of much of the existing pre-war passenger rolling stock with over 5,000 diesel or electric multiple units or new carriages at a further estimated cost of ¬£285 million (¬£6.8 billion in 2020). The longer-term plan was to electrify all the major trunk routes, the important secondary lines and the remaining suburban systems - the Plan initially called for the acquisition of 1,100 electric locomotives for ¬£60 million (¬£1.4 billion in 2020) plus ¬£125 million (¬£2.8 billion in 2020) for electric infrastructure. Dieselisation would therefore serve mainly as a stop-gap between steam and electric traction, remaining only for more minor routes, shunting and certain freight movements. This was a major change from BR's existing traction policy, drawn up immediately after nationalisation, which had been based on perpetuating steam locomotives: Existing locomotive designs from the Big Four continued to be built post- nationalisation, and then BR designed a new series of Standard locomotive classes. Entering service in 1951, the Standards were intended to have a service life of 30 years and would be superseded by a rolling programme of electrification. In its early years BR largely halted the work done by the Big Four experimenting with diesel traction - completing pilot orders for prototypes such as those from the Southern Railway which would become BR's Class D16/2 but not perpetuating them. The exception was the continuation of the introduction of a series of diesel-powered shunting locomotives such as what would be the British Rail Class 08 and its variants, which entered service from 1951. The Modernisation Plan overturned this arrangement, even though many of the orders for the Standard steam locomotives were years from being fulfilled. Steam traction would now be replaced by diesels within a decade while the long-term electrification programme, while retained, would be slowed and scaled down. It was hoped that the rapid switch to diesel traction would deliver similar operational advantages and cost savings as electrification but at a faster pace and with much lower upfront capital costs. This committed many of the later-built Standard steam locomotives to be withdrawn having served only a third (or even less) of their intended service life. Although not laid out in the published Modernisation Plan, BR's initial approach to this huge acquisitional task was to implement a pilot scheme, commissioning orders for 174 diesel locomotives from six independent manufacturers (due to currency and political considerations these were all British firms, even though several had little or no experience of diesel locomotive design and building) plus BR's own design offices and workshops. These designs were spread across the three power categories BR had decided would fulfill its mainline motive power needs. The designs commissioned deliberately represented a diverse range of engineering approaches (Electric and hydraulic transmissions, four-stroke and two stroke engines, high- or medium-speed engines etc.) with numerous constructors and suppliers of engines and electrical equipment. The intention was that the most successful designs and elements proven by the pilot scheme would form the basis of the large- scale orders called for by the Modernisation Plan over the next decade. This policy was overtaken by political and economic events. BR's financial position was worsening as costs rose and traffic and revenue declined. BR's accounts had shown an overall negative balance since 1954 (-¬£23 million then, worsening to -¬£62 million by 1956) and in 1956 the organisation's net revenue fell into the negative for the first time (a loss of ¬£16.5 million). Costs were still climbing, market share and volumes of both passenger and freight traffic were falling rapidly and BR was facing a perpetual manpower shortage as the high employment and rising working and living standards and wages throughout the economy in the 1950s made working on the railways - especially the dirty, labour-intensive steam locomotives - unattractive. The railways were still suffering from a general public image of being outdated, inefficient and run down. The British Transport Commission and BR management therefore decided to expand the pilot scheme to hasten the introduction of modern traction. In May 1957 - a month before the first locomotive ordered under the original pilot scheme (the first of the English Electric Type 1s) entered service - the total orders were increased to 230 and the power categories were expanded from three to five, introducing new mid- and high-power types that BR had not originally considered necessary. In late 1958, as BR's financial balance approached an annual loss of ¬£100 million and still well before many of the locomotives ordered in 1955 under the original pilot scheme had been built, the BTC agreed to further accelerate the adoption of diesel traction by placing sufficient orders to introduce 2300 diesel locomotives by the end of 1963. Although some designs were not perpetuated in these bulk orders on the basis of the early experience with the pilot scheme, many of the types included in these orders had not yet entered full service and in some cases the prototype had yet to be built. Designs for the new Type 3 power rating - not present in the pilot scheme - were ordered in quantity 'off the drawing board' and only one Type 5 design was in existence (the production version of the DP1 prototype, the existence of which actually predated both the Modernisation Plan and the pilot scheme, even though it was not included in either). With numerous manufacturers being required to produce their own designs to meet the deadline, the standardisation intended in the Modernisastion Plan could not be achieved. The three standard classes originally planned - and even the five proposed in the revised plan - were replaced by a total of 14 distinct locomotive designs from numerous manufacturers, incorporating many of the diverse (and incompatible features) intended to be tested and evaluated against each other. This limited the theoretical operational benefits and cost savings from the widespread adoption of diesel traction, and many - but not all - of the designs ordered under the accelerated Modernisation Plan were plagued by reliability and service issues, leading to poor availability from the brand new locomotives and leaving some areas of the BR network with a shortage of serviceable traction in the early 1960s. Ironically, in 1967 British Railways drew up a National Traction Plan which rationalised its stock of locomotives and multiple units. Designs which had proven to be the most reliable and operationally efficient were selected for retention and modernisation while the others were designated 'non-standard' and earmarked for quick withdrawal and replacement - a belated implementation of the original pilot scheme which saw many of the locomotives ordered in the late 1950s withdrawn after only a decade in service and in some cases even before the steam locomotives they were intended to supersede. There were some fundamental incorrect assumptions with the classes of new locomotives ordered under the Modernisation Plan. Steam locomotives were replaced by diesel types on a 'like-for-like' basis with BR ordering, for example, large numbers of light-duty diesels intended for local mixed-goods services (such as the Class 20 and Class 24), which failed to take into account the decline in local and branch line goods services which was largely switching to the roads. In conjunction with the new marshalling yards, large numbers of diesel shunters were ordered which would soon be rendered virtually obsolete by the rise of container freight and, like the yards they worked in, often only served a few years before being scrapped. Both these factors were related to a failure by the Modernisation Plan to successfully redefine what the purpose of the railways were. British Railways remained bound by its legal status as a common carrier, which obligated it to provide carriage for virtually any type of goods, regardless of quantity (large or small) between any two stations on the network, at set and published rates. This legislation dated back to the 19th century to prevent the railways abusing their monopoly as the sole practical long-distance transport provider for much of the country, but the growth of road transport had left the railways locked into a highly disadvantageous position. Road freight operators had no legal restrictions and could turn down work that was uneconomic, which BR could not, and could easily undercut BR's carriage rates which the railway could not alter without legal consent. The common carrier requirements also saddled BR with the necessity to maintain thousands of goods yards and other facilities, plus rolling stock and staff to service them, even when there was ever-decreasing actual demand for those services and such traffic as did exist was very rarely profitable. This issue had been identified during the Great Depression and the Big Four had campaigned for repeal of the common carrier legislation as a 'Fair Deal' during the 1930s. However, this did not happen until the Transport Act 1962 gave BR freedom of contract, and until then the Modernisation Plan had to commission locomotives, rolling stock and facilities to manage the ever- declining but legally-required wagonload freight traffic. The timing of the Modernisation Plan was also unfortunate, as just months after its publication the train driver's trade union, ASLEF called a strike that lasted for 17 days, causing major disruption to the railway network. Many of BR's long-standing freight customers - especially smaller business and industrial users which provided much of the remaining wagonload and less than carload freight traffic, were forced by necessity to start using road transport and never returned to the railways, which hastened the existing decline in railway freight traffic and rapidly undermined the logic and business case in the Plan's renewal and expansion of large marshalling yards. The Modernisation Plan was a hugely costly failure for BR. The total cost was greater than the estimate, eventually exceeding ¬£1.6 billion (¬£33 billion in 2020) while the railways' financial losses (between ¬£102 million and ¬£68 million per year throughout the 1960s) while traffic volumes and market share continued to decline. While some of the new locomotives and rolling stock procured under the Plan was successful and would go on to have very long service lives, many proved to be embarrassing (and high-profile) failures. The modernisation of BR's freight-handling facilities was ineffective and even before the Plan was officially concluded many of the large yards built just a few years previously were mostly empty. The comprehensive failure of the Modernisation Plan to achieve its goals created a deep-seated distrust of BR's internal management within the Treasury and wider central government, causing BR's funding to be restricted and making any further large-scale investment to reform or modernise the railways virtually impossible - an attitude that was to dog BR for the rest of its existence. The Macmillan government responded to BR's financial issues and the failure of the Modernisation Plan by commissioning Richard Beeching to identify ways of stemming BR's losses and cutting operational costs - a very different premise to the large-scale investment and expansion of the Modernisation Plan. Electrification Virgin Trains West Coast Class 87 electric locomotive and Mark 3 coaches The Modernisation Plan called for significant suburban and main-line electrification. Despite investment in two 1.5 kV DC overhead schemes only a few years earlier, outside the Southern Region this was mostly done with the new standard 25 kV AC overhead line equipment (OLE), leaving these two older systems obsolescent. In the Eastern region the plan called for electrification of many routes to this standard. These included the London, Tilbury and Southend (LTS) line; suburban lines out of London Liverpool Street, recently partially electrified on the 1.5 kV DC system, were upgraded initially to a mix of 6.25 kV AC and 25 kV AC OLE and extended. The London King's Cross suburban lines were electrified at 25 kV AC in the 1970s. In the Scottish region electrification of large parts of the Glasgow Suburban was called for again at 25 kV AC OLE, which would over time grow into a large system. In the Southern Region the already extensive third rail system was to be extended to the Kent Coast. In addition to the suburban electrification, main line electrification was called for, starting with the West Coast Main Line. This was done in stages from 1959 to 1974, initially connecting Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool to London, and going on to Glasgow. The continuing electrification programme of the 1980s which saw the electrification of the East Coast Main Line, London St Pancras suburban system and further extension of the Southern Region network can be seen as a direct extension of this plan. Other events Two serious crashes, the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash in 1952 (in which 112 people died), and the Lewisham rail crash in 1957 (in which 90 people died) led to the introduction of the Automatic Warning System across the network. In 1958 the region boundaries were redrawn to make them geographical rather than based on pre- nationalisation ownership. Former LMS lines in Yorkshire were transferred from the London Midland to the Eastern and North Eastern region: the London Midland region gained the former Great Central Railway lines outside Yorkshire and Lincolnshire from the Eastern Region in return. Former LMS lines in the south- west of the country, including the northern section of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, were transferred to the Western region. Some routes were closed during the 1950s to take account of changing transport patterns and to remove obvious route duplication. For instance, in East Anglia most of the former Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway was closed in 1959; long-distance passenger trains on the former Great Central Railway main line ended in 1960 as a prelude to its later closure. However, the route closures were just a small taste of what was to come. The 1960s: Rationalisation The Beeching reports Lilbourne station in Northamptonshire, one of thousands of rural stations which were closed Network for development proposed in 1965 report \\"Beeching II\\" plans, shown in bold By 1960, the railway's performance was low, with a deficit of ¬£68m. This increased to ¬£87m in 1961 and still further to ¬£104m in 1962 (¬£ billion in terms). Under the Transport Act of 1962, Harold Macmillan's Conservative government dissolved the British Transport Commission, and created the British Railways Board to take over its railway duties from 1 January 1963. The railway's huge deficit and the reputation earned during the Modernisation Plan fiasco for bad financial planning led the government to take firm action. In 1962, the Transport Minister Ernest Marples appointed Richard Beeching as head of British Railways with a brief to cut the spiralling losses. Beeching was a businessman rather than a railwayman and his high salary (particularly in a nationalised industry) caused controversy. His report The Reshaping of British Railways (commonly known simply as \\"The Beeching Report\\") issued in 1963, concluded that much of the railway network carried little traffic and should be closed down. His report proposed a massive closures programme which would involve 5,000 miles of track, and 2,363 small stations being closed, which came to be known as the Beeching axe. The report also proposed that British Rail electrify some major main lines and adopt containerized freight traffic instead of outdated and uneconomic wagon-load traffic. The closures recommended by the report were mostly implemented. They peaked in the mid-1960s and continued until the early 1970s. By 1975, the system had shrunk to 12,000 miles (19,000 km) of track and 2,000 stations. In the event, the closures failed to produce the hoped for savings, or to restore the railways to profitability. In 1965, Beeching issued a second, less well-known, report The Development of the Major Railway Trunk Routes, widely known as \\"Beeching II\\", which singled out lines that were believed to be worthy of continued large-scale investment. This did not recommend closures as such, but outlined a 3,000-mile \\"network for development\\". The fate of the remaining network was not discussed in the report. Modernisation continues The late 1950s to the end of the 1960s saw first a reduction, then the final withdrawal of Britain's fleet of steam locomotives. Mass withdrawals of older classes started towards the end of the 1950s, with many of the pre-grouping companies' engines being scrapped. BR built its last steam engine, appropriately named Evening Star at Swindon Works in 1960, by early 1966 the Western Region was the first to have no steam locomotives at all and the last pocket of steam traction was withdrawn in the North-West of England in 1968. The short narrow- gauge Vale of Rheidol Railway at Aberystwyth in Wales was the only exception: it was still steam-operated on its sale by BR in 1989. The new diesel locomotives, so troublesome during the Modernisation Plan years, were becoming more reliable and the closure of so many routes after the Beeching Report meant that the required fleet reduced significantly, and by the end of the 1960s, all the pre-nationalisation rolling stock had been replaced with the new standard patterns. In the early 1960s yellow warning panels, now characteristic of British railways, were added to the fronts of diesel and electric locomotives and multiple units in order to increase the safety of track workers. The Transport Act 1962 converted British Railways from being the trade name of a BTC activity to a separate public corporation, as the British Railways Board. As the last steam locomotives were withdrawn, the corporation's public name was re-branded in 1965 as British Rail (see British Rail brand names for a full history). This re-branding introduced the double- arrow logo to represent the industry as a whole; the standardised Rail Alphabet typeface used for all communications and signs; and the BR blue livery, which was applied to nearly all locomotives and rolling stock. A minor reorganisation in 1967 saw the North Eastern region become part of the Eastern region. The 1970s: HST and APT The 1970s saw British Rail successfully introduce high speed diesel train services, as well as major resignalling projects designed to increase operational efficiency. In 1976, the InterCity 125 High Speed Train (HST) was introduced on some services and the InterCity brand was adopted. This created an increase in passengers using the railways and improved British Rail's finances. British Rail also started development of the world's first tilting train ‚Äì the Advanced Passenger Train (APT). However, lack of money, political pressure and the launch of the prototype into passenger service before technical problems were fully overcome lead to the project being cancelled in the early 1980s. The major engineering works of BR were split-off into a separate company, British Rail Engineering Limited, in 1970. This was subsequently split further, becoming British Rail Maintenance Limited, whose ownership was retained by British Rail; and British Rail Engineering (1988) Limited, which was prepared for privatisation. The latter went through a series of owners, mergers and take-overs and now resides with Canadian transport company Bombardier. In 1973, the TOPS computer system for managing locomotives and rolling stock owned by a rail system, was introduced. Hauled rolling stock continued to carry numbers in a separate series. The adoption of the TOPS system made for some changes in the way the railway system in Britain worked. Hitherto, locomotives were numbered in three different series. Steam locomotives carried unadorned numbers up to five digits long. Diesel locomotives carried four-digit numbers prefixed with a letter 'D' and electric locomotives with a letter 'E'. Thus, up to three locomotives could carry the same number - steam loco 4321, diesel D4321 and electric loco E4321. TOPS could not handle this and it also required similar locomotives to be numbered in a consecutive series in terms of classification, in order that they might be treated together as a group. A new classification system was devised in which, for example, all Brush Type 4 locomotives were now called Class 47 and all had numbers beginning 47xxx. The Intercity 125 High Speed Train High Speed Train powercar The InterCity 125 was planned as a stop gap measure, meant to fill until electrification was spread across all main lines and the Advanced Passenger Train (APT) was in service. Research had begun for the tilting train but it was not possible to predict when the APT would enter service. The HST applied what had been learned so far to traditional technology ‚Äì a parallel project to the APT development, based on conventional principles but incorporating the newly discovered knowledge of wheel/rail interaction and suspension design. The class holds the world record for diesel traction, achieving 148.4 mph (238 km/h) with a shortened set running speed trials between Darlington and York. Unlike the APT, the InterCity 125 was an outstanding success and is still in widespread use in . The HST was introduced from 1976 on the Great Western Main Line between London Paddington and Bristol Temple Meads/Swansea, at a time when the maximum speed of British trains was 100 mph (160 km/h). A radical update of the standard BR livery was complemented by the 'InterCity 125' branding which also appeared on timetables and promotional literature. By May 1977 the full complement was in service on the GWML and they completely replaced locomotive hauled trains on the Bristol/South Wales routes. Production continued, allowing the InterCity 125s to take over routes on the East Coast Main Line from 1978. They soon displaced the Class 55 locomotives to lesser workings and reduced the journey time to Edinburgh by up to an hour. The HSTs also took over routes on other West of England services from 1979, Cross-Country express trains from 1981 and finally the Midland Main Line services. The increased speed and rapid acceleration and deceleration slashed journey times around the country. BR enjoyed a boom in patronage on the routes operated by the HSTs and InterCity's profits jumped accordingly ‚Äì with cross-subsidisation in turn safeguarding the future of remaining rural routes which had been under threat of closure since the Beeching Axe of the 1960s. However, by 1986/87, InterCity was losing ¬£100m a year before interest, contributing to British Rail's ¬£720m deficit.  The Advanced Passenger Train  Advanced Passenger Train In the 1970s, British Rail developed tilting train technology in the Advanced Passenger Train; there had been earlier experiments and prototypes in other countries, notably Italy. The objective of the tilt was to minimise the discomfort to passengers caused by taking the curves of the West Coast Main Line at high speed. The APT also had hydrokinetic brakes, which enabled the train to stop from 150 mph within existing signal spacings. (Promotional leaflet) The introduction into service of the Advanced Passenger Train was to be a three-stage project. Phase 1, the development of an experimental APT (APT-E), was completed. This used a gas turbine-electric locomotive, the only multiple unit so powered that was used by British Rail. It was formed of two power cars (numbers PC1 and PC2), initially with nothing between them and later, two trailer cars (TC1 and TC2). The cars were made of aluminium to reduce the weight of the unit and were articulated. The gas turbine was dropped from development, due to excessive noise and the high fuel costs of the late 1970s. The APT-E first ran on 25 July 1971. The train drivers' union, ASLEF, black-listed the train due to its use of a single driver. The train was moved to Derby (with the aid of a locomotive inspector). This triggered a one-day strike by ASLEF that cost BR more than the research budget for the entire year. Phase 2, the introduction of three prototype trains (APT-P) into revenue service on the Glasgow ‚Äì London Euston route, did occur. Originally, there were to have been eight APT-P sets running, with minimal differences between them and the main fleet. However, financial constraints lead to only three being authorised, after two years of discussion by the British Railways Board. The cost was split equally between the Board and the Ministry of Transport. After these delays, considerable pressure grew to put the APT-P into revenue-service before they were fully ready. This inevitably lead to high-profile failures as a result of technical problems. These failures led to the trains being withdrawn from service while the problems were ironed out. However, by this time, managerial and political support had evaporated. Consequently, phase 3, the introduction of the Squadron fleet (APT-S), did not occur, and the project was ended in 1982. Although the APT never properly entered service, the experience gained enabled the construction of other high-speed trains. The APT powercar technology was imported without the tilt into the design of the Class 91 locomotives, and the tilting technology was incorporated into Italian State Railway's Pendolino trains, which first entered service in 1987. The 1980s: Sectorisation During the 1980s, the regions of BR were abolished and the system sectorised into business sectors. The passenger sectors were InterCity (express services), Network SouthEast (London commuter services) and Regional Railways (regional services). Trainload Freight took trainload freight, Railfreight Distribution took non-trainload freight, Freightliner took intermodal traffic and Rail Express Systems took parcels traffic. The maintenance and remaining engineering works were split off into a new company, British Rail Maintenance Limited. The new sectors were further subdivided into divisions. This ended the BR blue period as new liveries were adopted gradually. Infrastructure remained the responsibility of the regions until the \\"Organisation for Quality\\" initiative in 1991, when this too was transferred to the sectors. Networker in Network SouthEast livery In the early 1980s, under the government of Margaret Thatcher, the possibility of more Beeching-style cuts was raised again briefly. In 1983 Sir David Serpell, a civil servant who had worked with Dr Beeching, compiled what became known as the Serpell Report which called for more rail closures. The report was met with fierce resistance from many quarters, and it was quickly abandoned. Prices rose quickly in this period, rising 108% in real terms from 1979 to 1994, as prices rose by 262% but RPI only increased by 154% in the same time. Super Sprinter in Regional Railways livery Much of the rolling stock of BR was becoming increasingly obsolete and nearing the end of its life. An attempt at a cheap DMU replacement was made with the Pacer‚Äîessentially a modified bus body mounted on a rigid 4-wheel freight wagon chassis‚Äîwhich met with customer dissatisfaction. However, more successful stock such as the Sprinter DMU, the Networker DMUs, and EMUs were introduced. To considerable surprise, the Thatcher government, which had been perceived as anti-rail, authorized the electrification of the East Coast Main Line including the line from Doncaster to Leeds from 1985, with the work completed in 1991. At a regional level, Network SouthEast undertook numerous electrification projects, including the Midland Main Line to Bedford and the Southern 750 V DC system reached Hastings and Weymouth. Electrification in East Anglia included the line from London Liverpool Street to Norwich and also to King's Lynn. Thameslink, a service that connected the northern and southern halves of London's suburban network, was introduced via the re-opened Snow Hill tunnel in 1988. The Chiltern Main Line was extensively modernised to open up an additional link between London Marylebone and Birmingham Snow Hill. The service was successfully launched in 1987.  Clapham Junction accident  In 1988, the Clapham Junction rail crash killed 35 people when three commuter trains collided, the worst railway accident in Britain in 30 years. The recommendations of the subsequent inquiry had far- reaching effects. The inquiry was chaired by QC Anthony Hidden and published a report in September 1989. It found that the direct cause of the disaster was sloppy work practices in which an old wire, incorrectly left in place after rewiring work and still connected at the supply end, created a false feed to a signal relay, thereby causing its signal to show green when it should have shown red. A contributing technical factor was the lack of double switching in the signal relay circuits, which would have prevented a single false feed causing an accident. The inquiry recommended the introduction of the Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, although it is not certain this would have prevented the accident (ATP guards against driver error, not installation error). Following the Clapham Junction accident and two other fatal accidents in early 1989, British Rail was keen to implement the ATP system across the entire British railway network. However, the then Conservative government, which was preparing the company for privatisation, baulked at the cost (estimated at over ¬£1bn). In the end, two different proprietary systems were trialled, TBL on the Great Western Main Line and SELCAB on the Chiltern Main Line, but neither system was rolled out across the network. Today, all Great Western Railway HSTs are fitted with ATP and are not permitted to carry passengers unless the system is functioning. The Hidden report also reacted to criticism of the 1950s-designed Mk 1 coaching stock involved in the accident. The report accepted that withdrawal of the Mark 1 units was not practical and the design was safe: \\"The inventory of Mark I coaching stock is large, and much of it has not reached an end of economic life, nor will do so for another decade or more. Mark I vehicles have good riding qualities, and are not intrinsically lacking in collision resistance.\\" British Rail was still using multiple units with underframes that had been constructed before World War II and these had priority for replacement. The 1990s: Privatisation A First North Western Class 156 at Romiley Junction station, near Manchester in the year 2001. It is in its former Regional Railways North West livery. The first half of the 1990s was dominated by the privatisation of British Rail by the government of John Major. The privatisation was the result of the Railways Act 1993 and the operations of the British Railways Board (BRB) were broken up and sold off. (Some \\"non-core\\" parts of the BRB's operations, such as its hotels, had been sold off by the administration of Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s.) In 1990, Margaret Thatcher was replaced by John Major as Prime Minister. The Thatcher administration had already sold off nearly all the former state-owned industries, apart from the national rail network. In its manifesto for the 1992 general election the Conservatives included a commitment to privatise the railways, but were not specific about details. They unexpectedly won the election on 9 April 1992 and, consequently, had to develop a plan to carry out the privatisation before the Railways Bill was published the next year. The management of British Rail strongly advocated privatisation as one entity, a British Rail PLC in effect. John Major favoured the resurrection of something like the \\"Big Four\\" companies that had existed before 1948. The Treasury advocated the creation of seven, later 25, passenger railway franchises as a way of maximising revenue. The Treasury view prevailed. Despite privatisation being on the agenda, in Yorkshire the Wharfedale line was electrified starting in 1994 by British Rail. A follow on from the Chiltern Main Line upgrade was to be the nationwide roll-out of the Automatic Train Protection system, which helped prevent accidents caused by Signals Passed at Danger (SPADs). However, privatisation intervened and this plan was abandoned. A lack of resources also led to the cancellation during the planning stage of other major infrastructure refurbishment projects, including Crossrail, an east-west line through London which is now being constructed. Originally due for completion in 2018, the opening date has since been pushed back to March 2021. The InterCity 250 upgrade to the West Coast Main Line was also cancelled, this instead ran as the West Coast Main Line upgrade which allowed tilting Pendolinos to run at 125 mph. The Railways Bill established a complex structure for the rail industry. British Rail was broken up and sold to private companies, splitting the structure into over 100 separate companies. There were some regulatory mechanisms: contracts for the use of railway facilities must be approved or directed by the Office of Rail Regulation, although some facilities are exempt from this requirement. Contracts between the principal passenger train operators and the state are called \\"franchise agreements\\", which specify minimum service levels, and the amount of subsidy / premium to be paid over the course of the franchise. Franchises were first the responsibility of the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, then its successor the Strategic Rail Authority and now with the Secretary of State for Transport. Initially, British Rail was broken up into various units frequently based on its own organisational sectors, still controlled by the British Railways Board, but which were sold off over the next few years. The passage of the Railways Bill was controversial and there was much lobbying against the Bill. The Labour Party was opposed to it and promised to renationalise the railways, as and when resources allowed, when it returned to government‚Äîthough this was not achieved during their period in government between 1997 and 2010. The Railways Bill became the Railways Act on 5 November 1993, and the organisational structure dictated by it came into effect on 1 April 1994. References Sources    Wilson, David C. \\"Forward!

The station calls itself \\"Alt 94.7\\" and it programs an Alternative Rock radio format. The Entercom outlet has its transmitter off Rosebud Lane in Citrus Heights. Its studios are located in North Highlands (with a Sacramento address). KKDO broadcasts in the HD Radio format. Its HD2 subchannel carries \\"Channel Q,\\" a Radio.com format of LGBTQ talk and EDM dance music. History In Carson City KKDO is considered a \\"move in\\" station, because it moved about 80 miles to be in the Sacramento radio market. The station signed on the air in Carson City, Nevada, on November 25, 1970, as KNIS. It was owned by Western Inspirational Broadcasters, Inc., and broadcast from McClellan Park with a Christian radio format. In 1984, Western Inspirational Broadcasters sold the station to Sapphire Broadcasting, though it would retain Western's religious format. In 1990, a new KNIS, now the key station of the Pilgrim Radio religious network, went on the air at 91.3. 94.7 became KRWR at the same time and asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for permission to move from Carson City to Fair Oaks, California. The station became KIZS in 1992 and KTHX-FM in 1994 as the FCC decided on the Fair Oaks proposal. In 1996, the Susquehanna Radio Company, which would be bought out by Entercom a year later, acquired the newly minted Sacramento market station for $14.95 million. Smooth Jazz The station's former logo under the previous format In 1998, 94.7 entered the Sacramento market with a smooth jazz format as KSSJ. KSSJ proved to be a success story in the market, where it established itself as one of the top-rated stations in several Arbitron ratings reports since its sign on. It was the successor to KSSJ at 101.9, which ended when American Radio Systems sold 101.9 to Excell Communications (now part of Entravision Communications) and the KSSJ intellectual property went to Entercom. In late February 2010, KSSJ dropped its \\"Smooth Jazz\\" slogan, re-branding itself as simply \\"94/7 KSSJ\\" while also changing its logo and adding additional adult contemporary and urban AC vocals to the playlist, transitioning to Smooth AC. Alternative Rock On March 3, 2010, the KSSJ website, as well as e-mails, indicated that the format would change at noon. Management stated \\"the audience for the station can no longer sustain the business of the station.\\" At 12:01 p.m., March 3, 2010, KSSJ switched over to a gold-based alternative rock format, branded as \\"Radio 94-7.\\" The call letters were also changed to KKDO.KSSJ Signs Off In Sacramento, Becomes \\"Radio 94.7\\" The first song on \\"Radio\\" was Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Today\\".

Chorpenning Jr. (sometimes spelled 'Chorpening')(1 June 1820 - 3 April 1894) was a pioneer in the transportation of mail, freight, and passengers through the arid and undeveloped western regions of nineteenth- century United States. His efforts in the 1850s were vital to the integration of the then-new state of California with the established government and economy east of the Mississippi River. George Chorpenning was born in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, the son of a county judge. He spent his youth in Somerset, and as a young adult he established a business in nearby Stoystown, Pennsylvania. In 1850 he traveled to California in search of gold. Although he did not become wealthy by mining, he could see the critical need for fast and reliable mail service between California and the eastern states, most of which was then being transported by sea around South America. He teamed with fellow Pennsylvania entrepreneur Absolam Woodward, and they received a contract in April 1851 from the U.S. Post Office to provide monthly transport of the mail between Sacramento, California and Salt Lake City, the most difficult leg of the first overland mail service. The mails were run once per month in each direction. It was a hard journey over the Sierra Nevada, and 16 days was considered good time. Captain Woodward, of Indiana County, Pennsylvania, made his first run, from California to Salt Lake City, in the winter of 1851/1852. He (as well as four other men in the party) was killed in an Indian attack at Stone House, Nevada;Chapman, Arthur, The Pony Express (1932, A. L. Burt Co., Chicago). The attacks began near the St. Mary's River, in what is now western Nevada. There were two attacks; the first was rebuffed but the second, occurring a good deal east of the first, killed the four men and wounded Woodward. The wounded man escaped with two animals. His body was found in April 1852 near Deep Creek, some 300 miles from the attack site. after that Chorpenning had the contract alone, and initially rode the trips himself. Although he persisted in keeping to his agreement with the Post Office, he saw that the schedule was difficult to meet, and that their chosen route along the California Trail was difficult to follow, especially in winter. Chorpenning renewed his mail contract in 1854, but switched the route to an all-season road from Salt Lake City southwest to San Diego, California, and from there by ship to San Francisco, California. In 1858 he received a third government contract, this time for twice-monthly service and including stagecoach (passenger) service. By then Chorpenning had learned from Howard Egan about a more direct route from Salt Lake City, around the south end of the Great Salt Lake Desert, and through the mountains of central Nevada to the new towns of Carson City, Nevada and Genoa, Nevada. In 1859 Chorpenning used the eastern half of this route, connecting with the original Humboldt River route at Gravelly Ford, near present-day Beowawe, Nevada. By 1860 the full Central Nevada Route had been surveyed by James H. Simpson and improved by the U.S. Army. Chorpenning built a series of provisioned way stations along the route to allow rapid exchange of mule teams. Unfortunately Chorpenning also had his mail contract annulled in 1860, largely for political reasons. Companies headed by William Hepburn Russell took over the route, and used Chorpenning's way stations to establish the short-lived Pony Express mail service. The Pony Express became obsolete in late 1861 when the First Transcontinental Telegraph, also using Chorpenning's route and way stations, became operational. Transportation along Chorpenning's central route continued until the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869. Chorpenning returned to the eastern states, where he was instrumental in organizing Civil War army units for the state of Maryland. He later petitioned the U.S. Government (unsuccessfully) to meet their contractual obligations for his mail transport service, a process which exposed the capricious nature by which they let (and annulled) contracts. George Chorpenning died in New York City in 1894. His hometown newspaper, the Somerset Herald, printed his obituary on 11 April 1894: References *Nevada's Northeast Frontier, by Eda Patterson, Louise Ulph, and Victor Goodwin (1969), *Dictionary of American Biography, vol.

Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake and Damian Wayne are generally the versions of Robin chosen to be portrayed. For decades, Robin rarely appeared without Batman. Now, he often appears as a member of variations of the Teen Titans. Furthermore, from the 1940s to 1980s, Dick Grayson was generally portrayed as being a teenager or adult. Television Live-action Batman (1966) In the 1960s Batman television series and its 1966 movie offshoot, Robin (Dick Grayson) was played by Burt Ward. Ward reprises his role as Robin in Legends of the Superheroes, and the Dick Grayson of Earth-66 in Crisis on Infinite Earths‚Äù. Burt Ward played Robin in the 1966-1968 Batman TV series as well as a 1966 film of the same name Titans (2018) Dick Grayson Actor Brenton Thwaites starred as Detective Richard \\"Dick\\" Grayson in the Titans web television series, debuting in the first episode. He is a circus acrobat, and along with his parents, a member of the \\"Flying Graysons\\". His parents are killed during a circus act by gangsters attempting to extort protection money from the circus. He is then taken in by Bruce Wayne/Batman and becomes his crime-fighting partner, Robin. However, he leaves his mentor's side after fearing that he was mirroring Bruce's worse qualities. Throughout the show's first season, he begins to lead a group consisting of other young heroes, including Beast Boy, Starfire, and Raven. In the first season's seventh episode, he burns his Robin costume and departs from the identity. However, Dick's time as Robin is continued to be explored through flashbacks, whilst the character adopts the identity of Nightwing in the season 2 finale. Jason Todd Actor Curran Walters portrays Jason Todd, the second Robin, debuting in the show's sixth episode. Like his comic- counterpart, Batman took him in while catching him attempting to steal the tires off the Batmobile. He is reckless and full of anger, acting on his own moral code and often operating on his own. He is shown to have been given much more liberties and authority as Batman's partner than Dick was. Todd made an uncredited appearance in ‚ÄúCrisis on Infinite Earths‚Äù where he and Hawk were witnessing the Antimatter wave approach and consume his home on Earth-9. Jason is set to abandon the Robin mantle as he will become Red Hood in the third season. Animation Super Friends In DC Comics related cartoon series, produced by Filmation and Hanna-Barbera throughout the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Super Friends, Robin (Dick Grayson) was voiced by Casey Kasem or Burt Ward. Both the live-action and animated versions wore the standard Robin costume, much like the film serial versions of the 1940s. He is not paired with Batman in the Cartoon Network programs Justice League and Justice League Unlimited due to the Bat-Embargo which limited the use of Batman-related characters from any media source outside of the new Batman Begins movie franchise and The Batman animated series. DC animated universe The Dick Grayson version of Robin made his first appearance during the first season of Batman: The Animated Series (1992‚Äì1995), voiced by Loren Lester. The second season was known as The Adventures of Batman and Robin. By the time the revamp series The New Batman Adventures takes place Grayson has adopted the identity of Nightwing. The Tim Drake version appears as the second incarnation in The New Batman Adventures (1997‚Äì1998), though he is also partially based on Jason Todd. Versions of the Carrie Kelley (Anndi McAfee) and 1950s (Brianne Siddall) Robins, both in the original costume, also make short appearances on the show in a dream sequence from the episode \\"Legends of the Dark Knight\\". Tim Drake was voiced by Mathew Valencia in The New Batman Adventures, and by Eli Marienthal and Shane Sweet on Static Shock. Teen Titans The Cartoon Network series Teen Titans (an adaptation of the New Teen Titans comic book series) with one similarity is that the character Robin is the Teen Titan's leader. Robin joins Beast Boy, Cyborg, Raven and Starfire when Jump City is threatened by aliens in \\"Go!\\". Robin is generally respected by the others as the team's best leader, but on the inside he is driven by an unhealthy obsession to win, which sometimes alienates him from his teammates (\\"Divide And Conquer\\", \\"Masks\\", \\"Winner Take All\\", \\"The Quest\\"). In many instances, Robin's relationship to Batman is heavily referenced. In \\"Go\\", just before Robin attacks a thief, bats fly at him. After a while the thief says, \\"This isn't your town, aren't you supposed to be with...\\" only to be interrupted by Robin who says, \\"Just moved here. And from now on I work alone.\\", and throughout the episode, he says he doesn't want to be in a team again so soon. In \\"Haunted\\", Raven uses her powers to enter Robin's mind; one of the images she sees is Robin's shadow in a cave area swearing an oath to someone, and part of a circus ring with two figures falling (taken from Dick Grayson's origin). When Robin rejects Slade in \\"Apprentice: Part 2\\" as a father figure he mentions \\"I already have a father\\", and then the screen shows a shot of a dark sky with bats flying through it, also referring to Batman. In that same episode, a battle ensues on top of a building that says \\"WAYNE ENTERPRISES\\". In \\"The Quest\\", Robin says that he was trained by the best and this is believed to be a reference to the Batman. Robin also has shown to have romantic feelings for Starfire since they first met (just like Dick Grayson). There have been romantic moments shared between the two in the series, but neither Robin nor Starfire admit their feelings for each other until the movie Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo. During the film, Robin and Starfire come very close to admitting their feelings and having their first romantic kiss, but sadly Robin proves to be too focused on the mission (and also being interrupted by Beast Boy and the others) before insisting that, as heroes, they can never be anything more. However, after the film's climax battle, Robin and Starfire finally admit their feelings for each other and share their first true romantic kiss with Cyborg commenting, \\"Well, it's about time!\\". In the end, they are both seen holding hands and finally become a romantic couple. The Batman The Dick Grayson version of Robin appeared in The Batman, voiced by Evan Sabara. In this version, Dick Grayson is an energetic, gifted 15-year old acrobat and one of the main attractions of Hayley's Circus, along with his parents, as part of the amazing Flying Grayson's act. His life was changed forever when Tony Zucco and his brothers tried to threaten Grayson's father into taking a \\"protection\\" policy. When the Graysons refused, an altercation resulted in the police and Batman being called. The Zuccos were easily defeated for the moment one of Tony's brothers was even captured. An angered Zucco altered the rigs on the Flying Graysons trapeze act, causing Dick's parents to fall to their deaths right in front of their son during a performance. With no surviving family members, Dick was taken in by Bruce Wayne as Bruce saw shades of himself in Dick after his own parents' murder. After Dick discovered that Wayne was Batman, the two worked together to capture Zucco. Dick chose the codename \\"Robin\\" because that is what his mother had called him. As depicted in a possible future during the episode \\"Artifacts\\", Dick Grayson gives up the \\"Robin\\" name and costume to become Nightwing. Barbara and Batman still persist in calling him by his original codename. Batman did this more out of habit, and Barbara did it as a flirting sort of way to annoy Dick. The police department who discover the Batcave in the beginning of the episode call Robin as 'Red Robin', a reference to Kingdom Come, and they theorize that Bruce Wayne was Red Robin (with his father as Batman and his mother as Batwoman). Krypto the Superdog In the Krypto the Superdog episode, \\"Bathound and the Robin\\", a literal robin called Robbie is saved by Ace the Bathound and wants to be Ace's sidekick, much to the dismay of Ace. Robbie's costume resembled the classic outfit of Dick Grayson. Batman: The Brave and the Bold Dick Grayson was featured in Batman: The Brave and the Bold in the episode \\"The Color of Revenge!\\" He is depicted as the protector of Bl√ºdhaven - the city where he fights crime in the comics as Nightwing - but he is seen in the episode still as Robin. The rift between him and Batman has already taken place, and he is seen to still be angry at Batman for still treating him as a sidekick rather than a superhero in his own right. It is only after cooperating with Batman to defeat Crazy Quilt that Robin earns Batman's respect. After Crazy Quilt is defeated, Robin joins Batman when Killer Moth hijacks the Gotham Bank Money Train, but he rides in the sidecar of Batman's motorcycle (something he stated he never wanted to do again). Robin was voiced by Crawford Wilson, and the teaser episode has several references to the 1960s Batman television series. Subsequently, he is seen in \\"Sidekicks Assemble!\\" where he leads fellow sidekicks Speedy and Aqualad in a battle against Ra's al Ghul. At the end of the episode, he decides to step out of the shadow of his mentor and take the costume and identity of Nightwing. He is seen as Robin once again in the teaser for \\"Emperor Joker!\\", which shows a flashback to an earlier battle between the Dynamic Duo and Firefly. In \\"The Criss Cross Conspiracy!\\", Nightwing returns and a flashback shows him as Robin. Dick eventually becomes the new Batman in the alternate future story, \\"The Knights of Tomorrow!\\", with Damian Wayne acting as the new Robin. The episode ends with Damian succeeding Dick as the new Batman after the former retires, and Damian's unnamed son (voiced by Sebastian Bader) becomes the new Robin. Damian Wayne is voiced by both Patrick Cavanaugh (as a child) and by Diedrich Bader (as an adult). Later, in the opening for \\"Triumvirate of Terror\\" Robin was seen in the team of the Justice League International playing baseball against the Legion of Doom. Young Justice Robin (Dick Grayson) is one of the main cast members in the animated adaptation of Young Justice. The character is voiced by actor Jesse McCartney. Along with Aqualad, Kid Flash and Superboy, Robin is one of the founding members of Young Justice. However, when not on team missions, he still lives and performs his duties in Gotham City. As the most experienced member of the team, he assumed that he would automatically be the leader, but this would prove to not be the case. When in combat with Batman, their relationship is so defined that they do not need to communicate and Robin therefore assumed he could disappear and that others would immediately know what to do. Robin nominates Aqualad who accepts, saying that Robin will one day take over as he was born to lead the team. Throughout missions, Robin is shown to be the hacker of the group, making use of the computer interface on his wrist. As the youngest member of the team, he is still a bit immature and can often be heard laughing in combat as to either toy with or intimidate his opponents. He also questions the meaning of words, such as wondering why something is overwhelming, and not just \\"whelming\\". In Season 2, set five years later, Dick Grayson has become Nightwing. He still leads the Team and has been replaced as Robin by Tim Drake. During the episode ‚ÄúSatisfaction,‚Äù a memorial hologram of Jason Todd, the second Robin, can be seen. The third season, Young Justice: Outsiders, is set two years after the previous outing. Nightwing still plays a prominent role in the story. In addition, Tim Drake and Stephanie Brown play minor roles. There are also cameo appearances from Damian Wayne and a revived Jason Todd. New Teen Titans The Teen Titans iteration of Robin returns in the New Teen Titans shorts, with Scott Menville reprising his role. One of the shorts included an appearance by the DC One Million version of Robin. Teen Titans Go! The Teen Titans iteration of Robin returns in Teen Titans Go! with Scott Menville reprising his role. In the show, Robin is portrayed as the self-appointed, hard-as-nails, hubristic, slightly power mad leader of the Teen Titans but fairly more light-hearted, and has a huge crush on Starfire but is too nervous to admit this, though he is also seen as being very arrogant, often depicting himself as the so-called \\"best superhero\\", believing that he is better than his friends and heroes should always put themselves in the spotlight and take all the glory. He is also a \\"sleep-Fighter\\", and is insecure about his lack of superpowers, which has, on multiple occasions, led to one of the other Titans committing mutiny and replacing Robin as leader. In some episodes, he is shown to fall into fits of madness easily, completely ignoring his team to follow through on his own view of how to carry something out. Such examples included continuing to dig an escape tunnel despite being rescued, forcing his teammates to rely on seven numbered options and scant resources during an educational 1800s-style road trip without even the slightest bit of concern for their well-being (which ultimately leads to their deaths, which he reacts to with a lot of callousness), and thinking that nature is so dangerous he needs to be on edge and eat whatever he can find. An episode also showed that he had a backup Robin squad which features Carrie Kelley, a darker Tim Drake, and the upbeat 60s version all voiced by Scott.  Web series  The Damian Wayne incarnation of Robin appears in DC Universe's adult animated series Harley Quinn, voiced by Jacob Tremblay.https://deadline.com/2019/07/harley-quinn-dc-universe-kaley- cuoco-tca-patrick-schumacker-1202651411/ He is portrayed as a spoiled brat who is not taken seriously by most individuals. In \\"Finding Mr. Right\\", in an effort to improve his reputation, he appears on a talk show and lies about Harley Quinn agreeing to be his arch-enemy. Offended, Harley kidnaps him and threatens to feed him to King Shark unless he confesses. Once he does, she reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain, humiliating him. However, Damian suffers a nosebleed, and King Shark goes berserk after smelling it. While he is saved by his father Batman, Joker temporarily kidnaps him before Batman saves him again. The dark knight later comforts Robin and assures him he can wait until he is ready for his own nemesis. In the season two premiere \\"New Gotham\\", Damian took up the mantle of Batman after he disappeared in the chaos caused by Joker's destruction of Gotham during the season one finale despite not being old enough to do so. Film Live-action Batman In director Lambert Hillyer's 1943 film serial Batman, Robin was played by Douglas Croft. Croft was the only actor to portray Robin at the actual age of sixteen; subsequent live-action actors have either been in their early to mid to late 20s. Batman and Robin Robin was played by 26-year-old Johnny Duncan in Columbia Pictures's Batman and Robin (1949), directed by Spencer Gordon Bennet. Live-action feature films Burton- Schumacher series =Early concepts= Robin did not appear in the Tim Burton movies Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992). This was an unusual move as the two 1940s serials as well as the 1966 movie and attendant TV show had presented the 'Dynamic Duo' as an inseparable pair, with the general public unaware that the comic-book incarnation of Batman often worked alone. The special edition version of the Batman (1989) DVD features an animated storyboard sequence of when Robin's parents are killed by the Joker. Jason Hillhouse provides the voice of Dick Grayson, while Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprise their respective roles (from the DC animated universe) as Batman and the Joker in the storyboard sequence. Burton planned to cast Northern Irish actor Ricky Addison Reed as Robin, but later felt it was unimportant to the story and cut Robin out altogether. At one point, the studio offered the part to Kiefer Sutherland, then 19, but the actor was unaware of Burton's style and direction of the film and eventually declined; in a later interview, Sutherland would later express regret years later. In an earlier script of Batman Returns, he was portrayed as a technologically savvy street kid who would help Batman following his narrow escape when The Penguin tried to kill him. He would later play a crucial role in Batman's final confrontation with The Penguin. In that script, he was simply called Robin, has no known real name, and was to be played by Marlon Wayans. =Batman Forever= Wayans was considered for the role of Robin in Batman Forever, but the change in directors from Burton to Joel Schumacher would also mean a change in the choice of actor for the role of Robin. Chris O'Donnell played the character of Dick Grayson in the film, alongside Val Kilmer in the role of Batman. Dick Grayson's parents and older brother were murdered by Two-Face during a hostage situation at the annual Gotham Circus after the family helps get rid of a bomb rigged to explode. Bruce Wayne takes him in as his ward out of guilt for being unable to save Dick's family. Dick soon finds out that Bruce is Batman and becomes a costumed hero in his late teens. His costume closely resembles the Robin uniform worn by Tim Drake and the Robin costume from Batman: The Animated Series. However, Robin's classic costume appears as Grayson's circus uniform, sans the \\"R\\" symbol and face mask. =Batman & Robin= O'Donnell reprised the role in the 1997 film Batman & Robin, this time opposite George Clooney as Batman. Tension between Batman and Robin is present in the film due to Robin growing tired of playing second fiddle to Batman and desiring to break free from Batman's shadow, particularly after Robin's recklessness leads to him getting frozen by Mr. Freeze. These feelings are later amplified when Poison Ivy exposes Robin to her pheromone dust and causes him to fall in love with her, sowing seeds of doubt regarding Batman's faith in his ward. In the film's climax, Robin eventually sees through Ivy's schemes and makes amends with Batman, and throughout the film, it is hinted that he harbours romantic feelings towards Alfred's niece, Barbara Wilson, who later becomes Batgirl. His costume is a blue rubber suit with a red bird symbol on the chest. He also wears a silvery Arctic version of his Robin costume. =Cancelled Robin spin-off= Chris O'Donnell revealed to Access Hollywood that a Robin spin-off was planned but got scrapped after Batman & Robin. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy In a June 2005 interview, Christopher Nolan, the director of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, said that as long as he was directing the franchise, Robin would not be appearing. Since Christian Bale was portraying Batman as a young man at the time of \\"Year One\\", Dick Grayson was still a child at that point. Bale has also given the same opinion regarding Robin, even though his favorite Batman story, Batman: Dark Victory, focuses on Robin's origin. =The Dark Knight Rises= In the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises, Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrayed a character named John Blake, a Gotham City police officer who was an orphaned child whose real name is revealed as \\"Robin\\". In the film The Dark Knight Rises, Batman finds an ally in a young policeman who goes by the name of John Blake (portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an original character created exclusively for the film. The character is Christopher Nolan's interpretation/re-imagining of several incarnations of Robin. Like Dick Grayson, Blake is an orphan who suffered the loss of both his parents at a young age, and like Tim Drake, he discovers that Bruce Wayne is Batman on his own. Blake is an orphan whose mother was killed in a car crash and whose father was murdered in a gambling related dispute when Blake was still a child. He was raised in St. Swithin's, an orphanage sponsored by the Wayne Foundation. He also develops a great admiration towards Batman. During his time there, he learned to hide his anger over his parents' deaths. When Bruce Wayne visited the orphanage, Blake noticed similar qualities between himself and Bruce, and single-handedly deduced that Bruce is Batman. When he was old enough, he became a police officer, and eventually befriends Batman's ally Commissioner James Gordon. After the discovery of Bane, Blake confronts Bruce and convinces him to return as Batman. When Bane publicly declares himself, Blake takes Gordon into hiding and arrests Selina Kyle to question her about Bruce's disappearance. He also shows his repulsion towards Gordon and Batman covering up the crimes of Harvey Dent. Blake joins Gordon and the other cops in a revolt against Bane's rule, but is caught and nearly executed. He's rescued by Batman, who tells him to evacuate the city. This attempt fails when external officers blow up the only bridge leading away from Gotham out of fear, since Bane had threatened earlier to have the bomb detonated (by a random citizen, later revealed to be Talia al Ghul, masquerading as Miranda Tate) if anyone tried to leave Gotham. After Batman apparently sacrifices himself to save the city, Blake quits the GCPD, disgusted that the mainland police were willing to let Gotham perish. He attends Bruce's funeral with Gordon, Alfred Pennyworth, and Lucius Fox. He later attends the reading of Bruce's will, and is pleasantly surprised to discover that Wayne Manor will become a home for the city's at-risk orphans, named in honor of Thomas and Martha Wayne. When he gives the name \\"Blake, John\\" to a clerk holding a package that Bruce had left him, he is told there is nothing there for him. He hands over an ID and suggests they try his legal name, which is revealed to be Robin. The clerk gives him GPS coordinates and spelunking gear, before she tells him that he should use the name \\"Robin\\" more often. At the end of the film, Blake follows the coordinates, and finds the Batcave. Gordon-Levitt has stated that the ending of The Dark Knight Rises is not a set up for a spin-off film and is the true conclusion of Christopher Nolan's Batman series. DC Extended Universe =Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice= Jason Todd is confirmed to exist and is currently deceased in the DC Extended Universe, with his suit covered in Joker graffiti making its first appearance in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Director Zack Snyder later confirmed Robin was killed ten years before the movie by a younger Joker, and the scene illustrated the sacrifices Bruce Wayne endured to be the vigilante and his willingness to face his past mistakes.http://comicbook.com/2016/03/31/batman- v-supermans-zack-snyder-explains-how-and-when-robin-died/ Snyder later claimed that the Robin that was killed by the Joker was actually Dick Grayson, though that may not be canon anymore. Following a behind-the-scenes video was released for the DC Extended Universe, it is revealed the suit did indeed belong to Jason Todd who was killed by the Joker before the events of the film, and is labeled as such at the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. =Suicide Squad= In Suicide Squad, it is revealed Harley Quinn was an accomplice to Robin's murder, something that wasn't present in the \\"A Death in the Family\\" (1988) storyline as Quinn was not yet created. Director David Ayer later clarified that the Joker was indeed the person who killed Robin. Animation Justice League: The New Frontier Robin (apparently Dick Grayson) was featured in the DC DTV movie Justice League: New Frontier, where he was adopted, as a teenager (not a child, as in most interpretations), during the events of the movie. Batman did so because he realized that he was frightening those he was trying to protect. The circumstances of his adoption are not explained. He was voiced by Shane Haboucha. Batman: Under the Red Hood In the DC Universe Animated Original Movie Batman: Under the Red Hood, an adaptation of the bestselling Batman storyline \\"Under the Hood\\" from Batman #635-650 and Batman Annual #25, Neil Patrick Harris voices Dick Grayson/Nightwing while Jensen Ackles portrays Jason Todd/Red Hood. Vincent Martella and his younger brother Alexander Martella each provide the voice of the young Jason Todd in different ages as Robin in a flashback in the beginning of the film. Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Carrie Kelly appears as Robin in the two-part animated film Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, voiced by Ariel Winter. Being a fan of Batman, Carrie took the mantle of Robin herself when the Mutant crime organization had been wreaking havoc on Gotham. Batman comes to see her as a suitable Robin, training her and using her to gather intel. She helps him with leading the former Mutant's group Sons of Batman into learning his less violent ways, when Gotham needed martial law enforced. When Batman is called out to a duel with Superman after refusing to go back into retirement, Carrie helps Bruce fake his death. She, along with Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) and Bruce train the Sons of Batman group to begin taking on his job. JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time Jack DeSena voices Robin in the Target exclusive 2014 direct-to-video animated feature JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time. DC Animated Movie Universe In 2013, Justice League: War was released, the first of a series of films that shared the same continuity, known as the DC Animated Movie Universe. Damian Wayne and Dick Grayson appear in several of these films, Damian/Robin being voiced by Stuart Allan while Sean Maher voices Dick/Nightwing. =Son of Batman= Son of Batman, an adaptation of Grant Morrison' Batman storyline \\"Batman and Son\\", was the first time Damian Wayne had appeared in a DC-related film. =Batman vs. Robin= In Batman vs. Robin, Damian comes into contact with the Court of Owls, being tempted to leave Batman and join him. Throughout the film, Batman and Robin fight over Damian's rawness and his lack of discipline, leading to Damian almost joining the court before Talon (voiced by Jeremy Sisto), an assassin for the Court, is ordered to kill him when the leader discovers his secret identity. After Talon massacres the entire court, he and Robin clash in the Batcave before Talon commits suicide. Afterwards, Damian leaves for a monastery in the Himalayas. =Batman: Bad Blood= Damian returns in Batman: Bad Blood, teaming up with Dick Grayson to investigate his father's disappearance. The Heretic (voiced by Travis Willingham), makes his first film appearance, as an artificially-aged clone of Damian like in the comics. Heretic attempts to absorb Damian's mind into his so he will know what it feels like to be loved, but Talia al Ghul executes him for his treachery and punishment, much to Damian's horror. =Justice League vs. Teen Titans= In Justice League vs. Teen Titans, Batman decides to have Robin join the Teen Titans to teach him about teamwork and has Nightwing drop him off at Titans Tower. Damian ends up warming up to the team after being initially hostile towards them, forming a particular friendship with Raven. =Teen Titans: The Judas Contract= =Justice League Dark: Apokolips War= Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders Ward reprised his role as Dick Grayson/Robin in the animated movie Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders and its sequel Batman vs. Two-Face. The Lego Batman Movie Michael Cera voices Dick Grayson in The Lego Movie spin-off The Lego Batman Movie. This version was adopted by Batman as a teenager and his Robin outfit is actually a modified Reggae outfit for Batman with the pants taken off. He has large, green glasses similar to the Carrie Kelley version. During the climax, he briefly dons a Batman armor labeled \\"Nightwing\\" when attempting to save Barbara and Alfred. Batman Ninja Feudal Japan versions of both Robin and Red Robin appear in the anime film Batman Ninja as well as Red Hood and Nightwing. This was the first time all four mainstream Robin's have appeared together outside of the comics. Gotham by Gaslight The 2018 animated film Batman: Gotham by Gaslight, taking place in Gotham City in the 19th century, features three orphan boys, Dickie, Jason and Timmy (voiced by Lincoln Melcher, Grey DeLisle, and Tara Strong, respectively), whose last names are never given. After Batman cripples their gang leader (who refers to them as his \\"Cock Robins\\", from the old nursery rhyme), they are recruited by Alfred for odd jobs and eventually adopted by Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle. This is a departure from the original graphic novel Gotham by Gaslight, in which no version of Robin appears. Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Robin is a major character in this 2019 film, and is heavily implied though never stated to be Damian Wayne. He is initially hostile to the Turtles after he finds them infiltrating the Batcave, but grows to like and respect them over the course of the film, and forms a bond of sorts with Raphael.

The Batman and Robin appearances provided time off for Bud Collyer, the voice of Superman on radio. These episodes called for Superman to be occupied elsewhere and the crime fighting would be handled by Batman and Robin. On that series the voice of Robin was played by Ronald Liss.

It is part of the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, and works in partnership with the University of Warwick's Warwick Medical School. It has a large, progressive accident & emergency department providing a trauma service to Coventry and Warwickshire. History The original hospital on the site, known as the Walsgave Hospital, opened in stages: the maternity unit opened in 1966, the general unit opened in 1969 and the psychiatric unit opened in 1973. It was demolished in spring 2007. A new hospital was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract to replace the Walsgrave Hospital and the Coventry & Warwickshire Hospital in 2002. The hospital was designed by Nightingale Associates and built by Skanska at a cost of ¬£440 million. Construction started in July 2002 and the hospital opened on 10 July 2006. Skanska subsequently sold its stake to Innisfree for ¬£66 million. The hospital is equipped with 1,250 beds and 27 operating theatres. On 26 March 2012, the hospital was designated as one of four trauma units in the West Midlands Region. In 2012, the planning committee approved an application to build a new car park at the hospital, to help improve ongoing congestion and traffic issues. The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter. Performance It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 6198 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 3.99%. 70% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 64% recommended it as a place to work. An 84 year old man fell off a trolley and died after a 6 hour trolley wait in October 2019. His daughter says he would still be alive if he had been prioritised, if her pleas for help had not been ignored and if doctors had seen him, and not only nurses. Coventry Hospital Radio The hospital plays host to Coventry Hospital Radio, a free station provided through the Hospedia bedside units and now online via their website. The station started broadcasting in 1972 after a patient wanted to hear a Coventry City FC match. Coventry Hospital Radio did provide commentary on every match until the move to the Ricoh Arena in 2005. Since 2016 the Saturday afternoon sports show (CHR Sportszone) has provided the latest football scores and rugby scores plus other sporting action. The station is run by volunteers and managed by an elected committee. The station is situated on the 5th floor and is available to all wards and online via the web providing music, entertainment and chat 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The Nordenfelt gun was a multiple barrel organ gun that had a row of up to twelve barrels. It was fired by pulling a lever back and forth and ammunition was gravity fed through chutes for each barrel. It was produced in a number of different calibres from rifle up to 25 mm (1 inch). Larger calibres were also used, but for these calibres the design simply permitted rapid manual loading rather than true automatic fire. This article covers the anti-personnel rifle-calibre (typically 0.45 inch) gun. Development The weapon was designed by a Swedish engineer, Helge Palmcrantz. He created a mechanism to load and fire a multiple barreled gun by simply moving a single lever backwards and forwards. It was patented in 1873. Production of the weapon was funded by a Swedish steel producer and banker (later weapons maker) named Thorsten Nordenfelt, who was working in London. The name of the weapon was changed to the Nordenfelt gun. A plant producing the weapon was set up in England, with sales offices in London, and long demonstrations were conducted at several exhibitions. The weapon was adopted by the British Royal Navy, as an addition to their Gatling and Gardner guns. During a demonstration held at Portsmouth a ten-barrelled version of the weapon, firing rifle calibre cartridges fired 3,000 rounds of ammunition in 3 minutes and 3 seconds without stoppage or failure. However, with the development of the Maxim gun the weapon was eventually outclassed. Nordenfelt merged in 1888 with the Maxim Gun Company to become Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company Limited. At least one Nordenfelt was re-activated for the 1966 film Khartoum and can be seen firing in the river boat sequence.

Metal rings have a long history of being used in Yau Kung Mun, Hung Gar, and other styles for weight training, to harden the muscle, skin, or bone, or strengthen the arms and fists. Types of rings Many different types of rings are available. The Chi Sau Ring is used for conditioning the body in many stances, and exercises. Four-inch-diameter () Chi Sau Rings weigh 600 g; iron rings weigh 800 g. Some iron rings are sold in sets, such as two small and two large rings. Some rings are made of other metals such as steel or brass, and rattan rings are also used for exercise. Use in martial arts Chinese forms training is done to improve the mind and body. To get the most out of your forms training, martial arts practitioner and writer Stefan Verstappen suggests that forms training be done with ‚Äúbrass or steel rings ...around the wrists and ankles to add weight during the performance of the form.‚Äù Verstappen states that ‚Äú[s]pecial wrist and ankle weights can help in the development of muscles, and endurance.

Gasnier and written by Charles Brackett, Frank Partos and Philip MacDonald. It is based on F. Britten Austin's novel The Drum. The film stars Cary Grant, Claude Rains, Gertrude Michael, Kathleen Burke, Colin Tapley, Margaret Swope and Billy Bevan. The film was released on October 11, 1935, by Paramount Pictures. Plot In Kurdistan during World War I, Michael Andrews (Cary Grant) is a British officer captured by Kurds, imprisoned, and awaiting execution. The local Turkish commander (Claude Rains) helps Andrews escape and confides that he is a British intelligence officer (initially \\"Smith,\\" later named as John Stevenson) in disguise. The two set out to warn friendly villagers of a pending Kurdish attack. After a difficult river crossing, and after Andrews flirts with a married tribal woman, Stevenson returns to espionage. Andrews, who has hurt his leg, goes to Cairo for medical treatment. There, Andrews falls in love with his nurse, Rosemary Haydon (Gertrude Michael), who ultimately refuses Andrews by saying she's secretly married to an unnamed man she'd known briefly a few years before. Andrews transfers to the Sudan, where his patrol takes over a fort after finding that its troops had been massacred. Meanwhile Stevenson goes back to Haydon‚Äîrevealed as his wife‚Äîwho confesses her love for Andrews. Stevenson requests a transfer to the Sudan to confront Andrews. Shortly after Stevenson reaches the fort, thousands of African tribesman attack it. Realizing that a handful of men can't hold the fort, Andrews, Stevenson, and their troops set out over sand dunes and eventually enter the jungle with the tribesmen in hot pursuit. British troops appear out of nowhere, deus ex machina, defeat the tribesmen, and rescue Andrews. Stevenson, mortally wounded in the battle, dies a hero's death, presumably leaving Andrews free to marry widow Haydon. Cast * Cary Grant as Michael Andrews * Claude Rains as John Stevenson * Gertrude Michael as Rosemary Haydon * Kathleen Burke as Ilya * Colin Tapley as Lt. Prescott * Billy Bevan as Cpl. Foster * Georges Renavent as Turkish major * Robert Adair as Sergeant in general's office * Claude King as General * Olaf Hytten as Doctor * Frank Elliott as Colonel Production Nomadic footage  The Last Outpost borrows stock footage from earlier productions, notably Merian C. Cooper's 1925 silent ethnographic documentary Grass‚ÄîA Nation's Battle for Life. The spectacular river-crossing and mountain-climbing scenes are a genuine record, filmed by Cooper, of traditional Bakhtiari migrations in Iran. Critical response Writing for The Spectator in 1935, Graham Greene gave a mixed review, describing the first half-hour of the film as \\"remarkably good\\" and the remaining 40 minutes as \\"quite abysmally bad\\". Greene praised the direction and camerawork of the first part as employing a \\"fine vigour to present a subject which could not have been presented on the stage\\", and he praised the acting of both Rains and Grant. The second part of the film (after Grant's character descends the mountain pass to Cairo and Rain's character returns to fight the Kurds) Greene described as \\"padded out [...] by the addition of a more than usually stupid triangular melodrama of jealousy and last-minute rescue\\".

It is in Llandygai Community  History  The village grew around the local slate industry, with many houses being built to house quarry workers and their families. The village is renowned for a street of houses that were built by Lord Penrhyn, proprietor of the Penrhyn Quarry and occupier of Penrhyn Castle, to accommodate the workers that refused to strike during the Penrhyn Lockout of 1900-1903.The Great Strike 1900-03 The street, Tanrhiw Road, was known locally as 'Stryd y Gynffon' (Traitor's Row or Tail Terrace) and was one of the first main settlements in the village based alongside the farmsteads of Ty'n Clawdd, Tanrhiw Isaf and Tahrhiw Uchaf. Tregarth has a population of some 1,000 people of which around 80% would consider the Welsh language as their first language. The village is the birthplace of a number of local luminaries such as the late Sir Ifor Williams, the late Ifor Bowen Griffith, the late T. Gwynn Jones Obituary -T Gwynn Jonesl and actor John Ogwen. Tregarth is also home to sculptor Ann Catrin Evans.  Amenities  Tregarth has its own primary school, chapel (Shiloh), parish church (Santes Fair, St Mary's) and community centre which is the venue for many village activities such as Ysgol Feithrin (nursery school), Youth Club, Clwb yr Henoed (Senior Citizens Club) and Snooker Club. The public house, Pant yr Ardd, was closed and put up for sale in June 2014. It was bought by an unknown source and is re-opened in December 2014. Owing to Bethesda's industrial heritage, Tregarth has two railway lines running through its centre, one the Bethesda Branch Line (London and North Western Railway) which was closed in 1963 and the other The Narrow Gauge Penrhyn Quarry Railway Line which was used to transport slate from the Penrhyn Quarries to Port Penrhyn and was closed in 1962. There was a station on the Bethesda Branch which opened in 1884 and closed in 1963. These lines have since been converted to the L√¥n Las Ogwen cycle path as part of Sustrans L√¥n Las Cymru cycle route 5 and take the cyclist on a journey from the Nant Ffrancon Pass winding through Tregarth down along the River Cegin towards Bangor and Port Penrhyn. An hourly bus service into the town is provided by Arriva Buses Wales. The Moelyci Environmental Centre (Canolfan Amgylcheddol Moelyci) can also be found in Tregarth; it is a community-based centre which specialises in the practice and teaching of sustainability.Moelyci Environmental Centre (Canolfan Amgylcheddol Moelyci) The centre runs many open days and activities and welcomes visitors.

Once in County Durham, it became incorporated into the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear and Borough of Gateshead in 1974. In 2011 the village was absorbed into the Gateshead MBC ward of Winlaton and High Spen. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 8,342. Winlaton was once at the centre of the local steel industry. Ambrose Crowley, a Quaker nail- manufacturer, moved in 1691 to Winlaton. He set up furnaces and forges there and on the River Derwent at Winlaton Mill. The river was ideally suitable for tempering steel, as the sword-makers of Shotley Bridge also found. Crowley not only produced high-quality nails, but also iron goods such as pots, hinges, wheel-hubs, hatchets and edged tools. He could also make heavy forgings, such as chains, pumps, cannon carriages and anchors up to four tons in weight. The Crowley works were regarded as the largest manufactory of the kind in Europe. The gates for Buckingham Palace were also forged in Winlaton. It still has one of the oldest forges remaining in existence, built c1690. Winlaton's front street is the village's forefront for shopping, as it has a variety of shops, public houses and takeaways. The Winlaton Centre, a local events venue, was built in 1973, and is host to events such as youth clubs and fitness classes. There is an Anglican church dedicated to St Paul; St Paul's church was built in the 19th‚Äìcentury.

In April 1944, it was on its way from Oslo to Kirkenes when it faced mechanical problems, forcing it to seek repair in Bergen, Norway. Due to lack of control, the ship was allowed entrance to Bergen harbour loaded with of explosives, even though the ship did not satisfy security regulations and should not have been allowed into major cities with this cargo. Resulting damage On April 20 at 8:39, the ship exploded at the quay in the center of Bergen. The force of the explosion caused a water column that was hundreds of metres high, spreading heavy debris. Several ships were thrown on land and Voorbodes anchor was later found on the mountain Sandviksfjellet at at a distance of 3 km away from the blast area. The air pressure from the explosion and the tsunami that followed flattened whole neighbourhoods near the harbour; then fires broke out and further destroyed the wooden houses, leaving 5,000 people homeless; 160 people were killed and 5,000 wounded, mostly civilians. The Nykirken was among the buildings which were severely damaged. Reporting The Germans initially tried to conceal the extent of the catastrophe, probably because it exposed their failure to maintain security regulations. Because the explosion occurred on Adolf Hitler's birthday, there was some suspicion of sabotage, but investigations revealed that the explosion was an accident caused by self-ignition. Rescue efforts after the event were extensive and have been well documented.

Its unique operating system produced a very high rate of fire of 1,600 rounds per minute. The same principle was later used as the basis for the widely used Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23L series of Russian aircraft autocannon. Description The weapon combines two barrels into a single mechanism so that the recoil from firing one barrel loads and charges the second. Ammunition feeds into the gun from two vertically mounted cylindrical drums, one on each side. The drums held 180 rounds of German 7.92 mm rifle ammunition, feeding them into the breech using a compressed spring. An experienced gunner could change ammunition drums in a few seconds. The weapon could fire single shots if one side of the mechanism had a problem. The gun's relative lightness at approximately without ammunition led to its airborne use; a telescopic sight was mounted between the two barrels. Its simple design eased maintenance and enabled its being field stripped in one minute. History In January 1915, Karl Gast invented the gun, which would become known as the Gast Maschinengewehr Modell 1917, while working for the Vorwerk company, the first weapon was produced in January 1916. Gast took out patents on 21 January 1916 and 13 February 1917, describing his weapon as \\"a double- barreled machine gun with recoiling barrels\\".Woodman, p. 137 Rates of fire of 1,600 rounds per minute were achieved during trials. In August 1917, Gast's demonstration so impressed ordnance experts that a production order for 3,000 guns, along with spare parts and ten ammunition drums for each gun, was awarded to Vorwerk und CompanieWoodman, p. 138 at a unit price of 6,800 marks each. Delivery of the first 100 guns was promised for 1 June 1918, with production increasing to 500 guns per month by September 1918. Production of the weapon exceeded these initial projections, and the weapons were favorably received with promises of an order for a further 6,000 guns being promised in September 1918. A version of the gun in 13 mm (13.2x92mm TuF), the Gast- Flieger MG, was also under development, which used the same ammunition as the Maxim MG TuF and had two, curved, box magazines. The gun was rarely used in service, and its existence was kept secret until three years after the Armistice; in 1921 the Allied Control Commission finally became aware of the Gast gun when a cache of 25 of the guns, ammunition, and designs was found near K√∂nigsberg. Gast himself had applied for a US Patent in 1920, which was issued in 1923. A Gast gun was evaluated by the US Army and found to be reliable and mechanically practical. However it was not felt to offer a sufficient advantage over existing machine guns to justify the expense of producing the weapon. Years later the Gast concept was rediscovered by Soviet engineers seeking to improve firing rates of their aircraft autocannon without resorting to the Gatling gun concept or powered revolver cannon. Previous efforts either had relatively poor rates of fire, or used gas operated revolvers, neither of which proved entirely satisfactory. The Gast concept was adopted for the Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23, which quickly replaced many previous designs. It was also used in the larger 30mm version, the Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-2.

It lies within the Administrative District No. 1 Stare Miasto meaning \\"Old Town\\" ‚Äì distinct from the Krak√≥w Old Town situated further south. Founded at the beginning of the 19th century when the region was part of Austrian Galicia, the cemetery was expanded several times, and at present covers an area of about 42 hectares. Many notable Cracovians, among them the parents of Pope John Paul II, are buried here. Gazeta Krakow.pl, October 29, 2008, A multilingual brochure available for the visitors, called \\"Zwiedzamy Cmentarz Rakowicki\\" (A visit to the Rakowicki Cemetery) with a map describing a two- hour walk, is published by ZarzƒÖd Cmentarzy Komunalnych w Krakowie. History The Rakowicki Cemetery was set up in 1800‚Äì1802 at an estate in PrƒÖdnik Czerwony village, originally on an area of only 5.6 ha. It was first used in mid-January 1803. The new cemetery came into existence in relation to a public health-related government ban on burials in old church cemeteries within the city. The land was purchased for 1,150 zloty from the monastery of the Discalced Carmelites of Czerna, and built with funds from the city and the surrounding villages (including some future Districts of Krak√≥w): Rakowice, PrƒÖdnik Czerwony and Bia≈Çy, Olsza, Grzeg√≥rzki, Piaski, Bronowice, Czarna Village, Nowa Village, Krowodrza and Kawiory, all granted the right to bury their dead there. The first funeral took place on January 15, 1803, with the burial of an 18-year-old named Apolonia from the Lubowiecki family of Bursikowa estate. Karolina Grodziska, \\"Plan Cmentarza Rakowickiego,\\" Gazeta.pl Krakow, 2002-10-30. In 1807, the first well was dug, and in 1812 the first big cross was built, paid for by public contributions. Rakowicki Cemetery was repeatedly enlarged over the years. The first expansion came in 1836 when 100% more land was bought from Carmelite friars for 5,000 zloty. The design of the new part of the cemetery was commissioned from architect Karol R. Kremer, head of the department of urban construction, who gave it the form of a city park. The surrounding wall was made using bricks and stones obtained from the demolished Church of All Saints. The newly built cemetery was blessed on November 2, 1840. The first chapel was erected in 1862, six years after the Austrian permit was issued. In 1863 the city purchased more land from Carmelite friars ‚Äì and from Walery Rzewuski ‚Äì on the west side of the cemetery, and buried there victims of an epidemic of 1866. In 1877 the new administrative centre was built along with the mortuary. The next expansion took place ten years later, in the autumn of 1886. In this new section, the nominal painter Jan Matejko was buried there, among other notables.Rakowicki Cemetery at cracow-life.com Between 1933 and 1934 the cemetery was widened at its north end, across an old military base, with a city street eliminated. In 1976, it was finally entered into the list of local heritage sites, and in 1979 it was the last place visited by Pope John Paul II during his June 2‚Äì10 first papal visit to his native homeland. Cultural significance An ornate tombs in the shape of a Greek temple The necropolis is a place of burial of the ordinary citizens of the city as well as national heroes: famous writers, scientists, representatives of noble families, independence fighters, political and social activists, leaders and participants of Polish independence movements and insurrections and veterans of the 20th century's two World Wars, among others. The name Rakowicki Cemetery derives from the name of the Rakowicka street, once a suburban road leading to the village of Rakowice 2 km away. Layout Within the cemetery, there are special sections allocated to graves of the participants of Polish national uprisings such as the November Uprising, the January Uprising and the Krak√≥w Uprising. First World War casualties are buried there, including ethnically Polish soldiers conscripted into all three imperial armies: Austrian, Russian and Prussian ‚Äì most of whom died in local hospitals. There are members of Polish Legions; the participants of the Charge at Rokitna; the workers killed during strikes of 1936; Second World War casualties including soldiers of the Polish September campaign of 1939. All Allied pilots shot down over Poland are buried here, including those originally buried in Warsaw, along with hundreds of Commonwealth of Nations casualties and prisoners of war who died during the German occupation; the latter brought together by the BAOR into a Commonwealth plot containing a Cross of Sacrifice.Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Krakow Rakowicki CemeterySzymon Madej, Krak√≥w Military Cemetery Polish partisans, the victims of Nazi crimes; and Soviet soldiers who died during their anti-German attack on Krak√≥w in 1945, are buried here.

Phonewords are mnemonic phrases represented as alphanumeric equivalents of a telephone number. In many countries, the digits on the telephone keypad also have letters assigned. By replacing the digits of a telephone number with the corresponding letters, it is sometimes possible to form a whole or partial word, an acronym, abbreviation, or some other alphanumeric combination. Phonewords are the most common vanity numbers, although a few all-numeric vanity phone numbers are used. Toll-free telephone numbers are often branded using phonewords; some firms use easily memorable vanity telephone numbers like 1-800 Contacts, 1-800-Flowers, 1-866-RING-RING, or 1-800-GOT-JUNK? as brands for flagship products or names for entire companies. Local numbers are also occasionally used, such as +1-514-AUTOBUS or STM-INFO to reach the Soci√©t√© de transport de Montr√©al,http://www.stm.info/en/info/customer-service/contact-us but are subject to the constraint that the first few digits are tied to a geographic location - potentially limiting the available choices based on which telephone exchanges serve a local area.  Advantages  The main advantages of phonewords over standard phone numbers include increased memorability and increased response rates to advertising. They are easier to remember than numeric phone numbers; therefore when businesses use them as a direct response tool in their advertising (radio, television, print, outdoor, etc.), they are proven to increase response rates by 30-60%. Regular side by side testing of phonewords and phone numbers in TV and radio advertising in Australia has shown that phonewords generate up to twice as many calls as standard phone numbers. A study conducted by Roy Morgan Research in February 2006 indicated that 92% of Australians were aware of alphanumeric dialling. Disadvantages In the age of advanced mobile devices, there is some disadvantage in using phonewords. Devices with physical keyboards such as BlackBerry and some other smartphones do not have the apportioned letters on the keys used for dialing, so one is unable to do alphabetic dialing without some other cross-reference to the actual phone number. This can be overcome by phonewords also being accompanied by the actual numeric phone number, allowing users of such smartphones to dial using the numeric phone number. However, devices which have virtual keyboards, including iOS and Android devices, will translate phoneword phone numbers in webpages and SMS messages to their proper digits within a hyperlink leading to that device's phone app, and their keypads show the appropriate local mapping of letters within their virtual dialpad. Some models of smartphones allow the user to enter letters into the device‚Äôs dialing window to allow the completion of phonewords. Numerous Blackberry models allow this feature by using the ALT key when pressing a key to select the letter, and not the number on the key. On older landline telephones, the O, Q and Z sometimes vary in placement or are omitted entirely; this is not an issue for most mobile telephones as all 26 letters must be provided to support short message service transmission. The dialing of 1 or 0 instead of I or O in phonewords can lead to misdialed calls; one such typosquatting incident targeted 1-800-HOLIDAY (+1-800-465-4329, the toll-free direct reservations line for Holiday Inn) by subscribing 1-800-H0LIDAY (+1-800-405-4329, the same number with 'o' replaced by 'zero') to a rival vendor which stood to collect a profitable travel agent's commission.86 F.3d 619, 65 USLW 2026, 39 U.S.P.Q.2d 1181: HOLIDAY INNS, INC. vs 800 RESERVATION, INC, Earthwinds Travel, Inc. and Call Management Systems, Inc, United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit. June 24, 1996. Regional variations Australia Phonewords were officially introduced into Australia following the release of the appropriate number ranges by the Australian Communications and Media Authority http://www.phonewords.com.au in August 2004. The ACMA markets the rights of use to the phonewords (also referred to as smartnumbers) via an online auction. Some phonewords have sold for as much as A$1 million with 13TAXI raising A$1,005,000. Proposed ranges for reserve prices for SmartNumbersTM are listed by Australian Communications Authority The types of numbers that are most commonly used include those beginning with the prefixes '1300', and '1800', which are ten digits long, and numbers beginning with '13', which are six digits. The differences between the prefixes are the length of the number (six or ten digits), the license cost to use them each year (approximately A$1 for 1800 and 1300, A$10,000 for 13 numbers) and the call cost model. 1300 numbers and 13 numbers share call costs between the caller and call recipient, whereas the 1800 model offers a national free call to the caller, with total costs of the call borne by the recipient. Japan Numbers can be used to spell out words in the Japanese language, with a system called goroawase. Most services are used by commercial establishments as an attempt to make their numbers easier to remember. Toll free numbers in Japan are prefixed with 0120. Examples include 0120-363963, where the numbers 3963 can also be read as „Çµ„É≥„Ç≠„É•„Éº„É≠„Éº„ÇΩ„É≥ (sankyuu rooson, \\"Thank you, Lawson\\"), and 0120-026-999 in which 026-999 can be read as „Ç™„Éï„É≠„Åß„Ç≠„É•„ÉÉ„Ç≠„É•„ÉÉ„Ç≠„É• („ÅäÈ¢®ÂëÇ„ÅßÊÄ•„ÄÖ„ÄÖ ), which literally means \\"bath - quick, quick, quick\\".‰Ωï„Å†„Åã„Çì„Å†Ë®Ä„ÅÑ„Å§„Å§„ÄÅË¶ö„Åà„Å¶„Åó„Åæ„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åì„Å®„ÅØ„ÄÅÊù±‰∫¨Êñ∞ËÅû„ÅÆÊà¶Áï•Âãù„Å°„ÅãÔΩ•ÔΩ•ÔΩ•  North America  Phonewords have been widely used for both local and toll-free numbers, with significant growth in the 1980s and 1990s. Local telephone numbers have always been subject to the constraint that the first digits must identify a geographic location, leaving less flexibility to select digits which spell specific phonewords. Toll-free numbering, as originally introduced by AT&T in 1967, was initially even more limited, as each geographic area code was hardwired to one or two specific exchanges in the +1-800 toll-free area code. This changed after Roy P. Weber of Bell Labs patented a \\"Data base communication call processing method\\"http://www.google.com/patents/US4191860 which laid the initial blueprint for construction of the SMS/800 database in 1982 and the portable RespOrg structure in 1993. A toll-free number, instead of indicating a geographic location, was merely a pointer to a database record; any number could geographically be reassigned anywhere and ported to any carrier. All seven digits were available to construct vanity numbers or phonewords. As toll-free telephone numbers, vanity 800 numbers support flexible call tracking which allows businesses to determine where their incoming call traffic is coming from, build a database of leads, access demographic information on callers, allocate personnel based on calling patterns, analyze ad campaign results and export data to other programs. The reports help to fine-tune advertising plans and media budgets by providing detailed information on specific media buys (such as radio, television or outdoor media). Some companies also match domain names to phone words (for instance, 1800-THRIFTY and the web site \`www.1800thrifty.com\`) to target phone and web users together. One brief practice was when the successive toll-free area codes were introduced (888, 877, 866, etc.), a business word or phrase would actually use one or more of the numbers in the area code. Examples of this were Rent-A-Wreck (1-87-RENT-A-WRECK or 1-US-RENT-A-WRECK), Speedpass (1-87-SPEEDPASS), and one of the first Vonage numbers (1-VONAGE-HELP). However, these proved to be more confusing than helpful to the callers, so the practice is not often used.  Russia  When the telephone appeared in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century, telephone numbers mixed letters and numbers. In 1968, the letters were replaced by numbers, but recently phonewords have returned to popularity in Russia. Many ISPs offer customers vanity numbers.  United Kingdom  Until about 1966 UK phones used a different scheme than currently used for relating letter to number keys. While generally similar, the scheme did not include the letters \\"O\\" and \\"Q\\" on the \\"6\\" and \\"7\\" keys to avoid confusion between the digit \\"0\\" and the letters; the zero key was used for \\"O\\" and \\"Q\\". \\"Z\\" was not included, and no symbols were associated with the \\"1\\" key. In earlier times exchange names were used and spoken to the operator; with the introduction of dialling, exchange names were used starting with three letters not used by any other exchange. A number would be published as WHItehall 1212, and dialled 944 1212. Generating phonewords Although businesses typically choose phone numbers so as to correspond to particular phonewords, it is also possible to go in the other direction, and generate phonewords corresponding to given numbers.

Dry plate, also known as gelatin process, is an improved type of photographic plate. It was invented by Dr. Richard L. Maddox in 1871, and had become so widely adopted by 1879 that the first dry plate factory had been established. With much of the complex chemistry work centralized into a factory, the new process simplified the work of photographers, allowing them to expand their business.  Development  Gelatin emulsions, as proposed by Maddox, were very sensitive to touch and mechanical friction and were not much more sensitive to light than collodion emulsions. Charles Harper Bennett discovered a method of hardening the emulsion, making it more resistant to friction in 1873. In 1878, Bennett discovered that by prolonged heating, the sensitivity of the emulsion could be greatly increased.

It explains how the south of Chile came to have its accidented geography.  Myth  Statue of Trentren Vilu Statue of Caicai Vilu According to the Mapuche, these two snakes were originally the children of the most powerful pillans, who were converted into their animal forms as punishment. Peripill√°n's son was turned into a huge snake that would be Caicai and Antu's son turned into a huge snake that would be Tenten. They were to be enemies, just as Antu and Peripill√°n were. Caicai was sent to live in the sea to help care for it with the Ngen-ko (water spirits), and Tenten was sent to live on earth to help care for the earth with the other Ngen, and to help humanity; thus these two snakes were used as an instrument through which the will of the ancient Mapuche spirits was fulfilled. It is said that after Caicai awoke from his years-long slumber, he became enraged because of the ungratefulness that men showed for every gift given to them by the sea, and desired to punish humanity and to incorporate all terrestrial life to his dominions. Caicai used his fish-shaped tail to hit the water, causing a great flood, since Caicai ordered the waters to flood the valleys and hills, and to bring all its inhabitants to the bottom of the sea. Humans invoked the help of Tenten, who saw that both humans and animals were desperate. By order of her father, she was the one who had to provide them with wisdom and protection, so she decided to help humanity. She helped the people and the animals to escape by raising them on her back and taking them to the hills; and she transformed into birds those who were trapped by the waters, so they could escape by flying; those who were drowning into fish and marine mammals (one of them being the origin of the cahuelche (talking dolphin)), and those who had already drowned into sumpall (Mapuche mermen and mermaids). Those who were immobilized by the terror they felt, were transformed into mankial (petrified). But as the sea continued to rise, Tenten had to order the hills to increase in height to counteract the power of Caicai. Angry, Caicai began to fight against Tenten in a titanic battle that lasted a long time, until both snakes were tired. Caicai was partially defeated as he wasn't able to flood all the land, however, the waters did not return completely to their old level, giving Chile its current geography. According to Chilo√© tradition, Caicai was satisfied with the portion of land that he had managed to flood, and delegated his functions pertaining to the sea to the great Millalobo. According to Mapuche tradition, after the cataclysm, everyone continued their quiet life; until one day it was Tenten who was angered by the attitude that men had, and made all the volcanoes erupt and the population had to move to other safer places. From that moment on, Tenten continues to manifest itself through earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, while Caicai causes tidal waves and floods when he rolls over during his sleep.  Similar myths  A variant of the myth tells that Caicai's anger against human beings began because a girl rejected her son, the Trauco. Some Huilliche communities of Chilo√© say that the battle originated because a daughter of the Trauco rejected the pill√°n Peripill√°n, and for this reason her son decided to take revenge. In Argentina there are other later versions of the myth, which change the original parents of both mythical snakes, indicating that they would be brothers and/or sons of the gods Nguenech√®n and Kueyen.

On that day, during World War II's Battle of the Scheldt in The Netherlands near Hoogerheide, the regiment attacked German positions on a raised railway embankment across 1,200 yards of open beet fields and suffered 145 casualties, including 56 dead, among them all four company commanders. Twenty-seven were taken prisoner. One company of 90 men was reduced to just four survivors. Background The Northern Front.By September, 1944, it had become urgent for the Allies to clear both banks of the Scheldt estuary in order to open the port of Antwerp to Allied shipping, thus easing logistical burdens in their supply lines stretching hundreds of miles from Normandy eastward to the Siegfried Line. Since the Allied forces had landed in Normandy, France on D-Day, June 6, 1944, the British Second Army had pushed forward into the Low Countries and captured Brussels and Antwerp, the latter with its ports still intact. But the advance halted with the British in possession of Antwerp, while the Germans still controlled the Scheldt Estuary. Nothing was done about the blocked Antwerp ports during September because most of the strained Allied resources were allocated to Operation Market Garden, a bold plan for a single thrust into Germany which began on September 17. In the meantime, German forces in the Scheldt were able to plan a defense. In early October, after Market Garden had failed with heavy losses, Allies forces led by the First Canadian Army set out to bring the Antwerp ports under control. But the well- established German defenders staged an effective delaying action. Complicated by the waterlogged terrain, the Battle of the Scheldt proved to be an especially gruelling and costly campaign. Historians have largely ignored it until recent years. After five weeks of difficult fighting, the First Canadian Army, bolstered by attached troops from several other countries, was successful in winning the Scheldt after numerous amphibious assaults, crossing of canals, and fighting over open ground. Both land and water were mined, and the Germans defended their retreating line with artillery and snipers. The Allies finally cleared the port areas on November 8, but at a cost of 12,873 Allied casualties (killed, wounded, or missing), half of them Canadians.Montgomery also bestowed the nickname \\"Water Rats\\" on the 3rd Canadian Division, a play on the Desert Rats title the 7th Armoured Division had earned in the Western Desert. General Crerar reportedly hated the term, though it was meant as a tribute to their success in amphibious operations in Normandy and the Scheldt. (Granatstein, Jack. The Generals: Canadian Senior Commanders in the Second World War.) The battle An area known as \\"the Coffin\\" due to its shape on maps was held by entrenched Germans of Battle Group Chill, holding the mouth of the Beveland isthmus. The Black Watch were tasked with attacking northward and cutting the land links between the mainland and the isthmus. \\"C\\" Company, was 30 minutes late at the start of the operation due to small-arms fire delaying their advance, and the supporting artillery attack was therefore ill-timed. Operation Angus continued with a second attack and a third was prepared, to be led by Wasp flame-throwers.

Overview The Morbegs starred two larger than life-size creatures called Molly and Rossa, who came from a mythical place called Morbeg Land. They lived in a castle somewhere in Ireland, and were looked after by various magical, wise wizards. Rossa was played by Cindy Cummings and voiced by Diarmuid de Faoite and Dominic Moore. Molly was played by Anna Galligan and voiced by Majella Horan and Tara Flynn. The two Morbegs appeared alongside various human actors, including Carrie Crowley. Often parts of the show were in simple Irish. The target age range was 3‚Äì6 years. A strong resemblance exists between the Morbegs and their RT√â colleague, Soky the Sock Monster, with each having brownish, fuzzy fur and sock-like appendages protruding from their heads. However, while the Morbegs arrived via inter-dimensional portal, Soky emerged from a long-abandoned pile of Dustin the Turkey's rancid, unwashed socks. This has led to speculation that the socks acted as a kind of imperfect, arcane summoning ritual which corrupted Soky's true form; this has never been confirmed by RT√â and remains a matter of controversy. Etymology The word morbeg is derived from the Irish words m√≥r, meaning big or large and beag, meaning small or little. The name was inspired by an Irish folk tune, 'Si Beag, Si Mor' [little fairy, big fairy] and was devised by Frances Kay, the script editor. The names Molly and Rossa were used by Frances Kay in some pilot scripts she wrote for the series, and were selected from a shortlist by the production team.

Biography  Fukazawa was born in Isawa, Yamanashi, Japan. His first novel, , won the prestigious Ch≈´≈ç K≈çron Prize, announcing his status as a rising star in the literary world, and has twice been adapted for film: first by Keisuke Kinoshita in 1958, and again by Sh≈çhei Imamura in 1983. Imamura's film won the Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or.  Shimanaka Incident  In the fall of 1960, the mainstream monthly magazine Ch≈´≈ç K≈çron published his satirical short story Fury≈´ mutan (È¢®ÊµÅÂ§¢Ë≠ö, ‚ÄúThe Tale of an Elegant Dream\\"). In the story, an unnamed protagonist narrates a dream sequence in which leftists take over the Imperial Palace and behead the Emperor and Empress, as well as the Crown Prince and Crown Princess, before an enthusiastic crowd. This story provoked fury in the Imperial Household Agency and among Japanese right-wing ultranationalists. On February 1, 1961, in response to the story, Kazutaka Komori, a seventeen-year-old rightist, broke into the home of Shimanaka Hoji, Ch≈´≈ç K≈çron magazine's president, killed his maid and severely wounded his wife. Fukazawa received death threats on a daily basis, and after offering a tearful public apology, went into hiding for five years. His promising literary career went into a long hiatus, and although he later returned to writing, he never fully recovered his \\"rising star\\" status. In later years, he could be found serving grilled bean cakes (imagawayaki) in a working class Tokyo neighborhood at a stall called \\"Dream Shop\\" (Yumeya). The aftermath of the meant that criticism of the Imperial Family, and discussion of the role or existence of the Emperor, became taboo.

Founded in 1885 as Wisconsin State Normal School, it became Wisconsin State Teachers College-Milwaukee in 1927, and Wisconsin State College‚ÄìMilwaukee in 1951. Originally at a downtown site, the Normal School subsequently moved to the Lakeside campus. In 1956, it became part of the then University of Wisconsin, and subsequently the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee's primary (Eastside) campus. History An illustration of the State Normal School, from the 1885 edition of the Wisconsin Blue Book. Wisconsin State Normal School at Milwaukee opened for classes in 1885 in a specially constructed building on the corner of 18th and Wells streets, with six teachers and 46 students. At the beginning, it was a normal school: a teacher preparation school for Milwaukee's soaring population at that time. After the turn of the 20th century, the school introduced several new areas of study including liberal arts and music education. In 1909, the school moved to the new Kenwood campus, on which had been erected a single building which would later be named Mitchell Hall. The north wing opened three years later. The original building is now used as the Milwaukee Rescue Mission. After moving to the new site, the school also began to offer even wider curriculum including agriculture, home economics, commerce, journalism, pre-medical and pre-law. The broadened curriculum proved to be popular and accounted for over one-third of the enrollment. Wisconsin State Normal School continued to grow after absorbing the Milwaukee School of Art and, in 1913, the school of music. The broadened curriculum, however, was attacked by the Carnegie Endowment for the Advancement of Teachers, arguing that normal schools should not stray from their role as trainers of teachers. In 1922, the State Normal School Regents voted to discontinue college courses in an effort to refocus on the instruction of teachers. The Wisconsin State Normal School then began to offer education-related four year degrees. In 1927, the Wisconsin State Normal School changed its name to the Wisconsin State Teachers' College-Milwaukee, popularly known as \\"Milwaukee State.\\" Known for its innovative and experimental programs in teacher education, the Wisconsin State Teacher's College was a national prominence at that time and was considered one of the top teacher training colleges in the nation by the 1940s. In 1951, when the Legislature empowered all state colleges to offer liberal arts programs, Wisconsin State Teachers College-Milwaukee changed its name to Wisconsin State College of Milwaukee, which merged with the University of Wisconsin- Extension's Milwaukee branch five years later to form the present day University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

He was the 7th Prime Minister of Mauritania from January 2, 1996 to December 18, 1997, Minister of Foreign Affairs from July 12, 1998 to November 16, 1998, and Prime Minister again from November 16, 1998 to July 6, 2003 under President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya; later, he briefly served as Minister of Foreign Affairs again in 2008. Biography Khouna was born in 1956 in Amourj in the eastern Mauritanian province of Hodh Ech Chargui. He was educated in nearby N√©ma and at a lycee in Nouakchott, graduating in 1978.Pazzanita 2008, p. 108. He received an advanced degree in agricultural science in Morocco, where he lived from 1978 to 1982. Khouna returned to Mauritania and joined the civil service, serving as director of the fisheries company Societe Mauritanienne de Commercialisation du Popsson (SMCP) from 1984 to 1992.Pazzanita 2008, p. 109. He was Director of the Algerian-Mauritanian Fishing Company from 1992 to 1993, then became Secretary-General of the Mauritanian Ministry of Fishing in 1994. He was subsequently appointed to the government as Minister of Fisheries and Maritime Economy on February 21, 1995. On January 2, 1996, Khona became Prime Minister, replacing Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubacar. In a surprise decision shortly after the reelection of the President, he stepped down as premier in December 1997 in favor of law professor Mohamed Lemine Ould Guig and became Minister Secretary-General of the Presidency. Between July 12 and November 16, 1998 Khouna served as Minister of Foreign Affairs during a period of instability in the cabinet. After leaving the Foreign Ministry, he was reappointed to the premiership under President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya. Khouna helped to come up with and carry out the policies of the President and attended many important conferences in place of Taya. In the summer on 1999, Khouna suffered a foreign policy setback when he could not secure an audience with Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika due to Mauritania's establishing full ties with Israel. Relations between the two countries deteriorated dramatically despite having a good relationship for two decades prior. Khouna denounced the opposition party, Action pour le Changement, in an important speech at the National Assembly in December 2001. The group was outlawed two weeks later. A member of the Republican Party for Democracy and Renewal, some of his aims were to address environmental issues.East & Thomas 2014, p. 346 In late December 2002, he announced that the government had responded \\"rapidly, efficiently and responsibly\\" to a potential famine and helped livestock farmers. He attacked the rise of Islamic extremism and the potential of youth recruitment to their cause in a May 2003 speech. Khouna began to become critical of some of the actions of the President. In the unsuccessful coup of June 9, 2003, he was detained on suspicion of having sympathies with the plotters of the coup and attempting to seek asylum in Spain. On July 6, Khouna was replaced as premier by Sghair Ould M'Bareck, who previously served as minister of education. Khouna would not serve in any cabinet position until 2008.Pazzanita 2008, p. 110. In the government of Prime Minister Yahya Ould Ahmed El Waghef, named on May 11, 2008, Khouna was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The inclusion of Khouna and others who had served under Taya in Waghef's government was controversial, however. This government survived for only two months, and Khouna was not included in the next government, appointed on July 15, 2008. In any case, the coup of August 6, 2008 led to the toppling of President Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi and his government. On May 21, 2011, he was named ambassador to Tunisia.

The airport is owned and operated by the state-owned Avinor and serves the municipalities of Vikna and N√¶r√∏y. The airport has a asphalt runway numbered 04‚Äì22. Wider√∏e flies to the airport with its Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft on contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The airport opened in 1986 as a municipal airport. It was first served by Norving, but Wider√∏e took over the flights in 1988. The airport was nationalized in 1996. Ryum served 33,532 passengers in 2014. History Plans for an airport with short take-off and landing flights was launched by the government in December 1983. The airport was proposed along with five other regionals airport: Fagernes Airport, Leirin; F√∏rde Airport, Bringeland; Mosj√∏en Airport, Kj√¶rstad; R√∏st Airport and V√¶r√∏y Airport. The plans were passed by Parliament on 10 April 1984. Grants for starting construction were issued on the 1985 state budget and operating permission was issued by the government on 6 September 1985. The financing was split between the state (60 percent), Vikna Municipality (30 percent) and Nord-Tr√∏ndelag County Municipality (10 percent). The municipal funding was financed through a loan in Kommunalbanken. Most of the state funding was granted on the 1986 state budget, along with three other airports. The original target was for 12,000 passengers per year. The airport was estimated to cost , but the lowest tender was between . The airport ended having severe cost overruns--NOK 12 million combined with F√∏rde Airport. Ryum was scheduled to be opened on 1 October 1986, but there was too bad weather that day that the ceremonies could take place, as aircraft could not land. R√∏rvik was initially served by Norving, which flew two services with the Dornier Do 228: Bod√∏‚ÄìR√∏rvik‚ÄìNamsos‚ÄìTrondheim and R√∏rvik‚ÄìBr√∏nn√∏ysund Monday through Friday. During the first winter several shortcomings were found in the terminal building and temperatures down to were measured indoors. Norving announced on 10 December 1987 that they would terminate all operations outside Finnmark. This took effect on 8 January 1988, leaving R√∏rvik without a scheduled services. Manning of the airport was reduced from eight to six, but the airport remained open from 08 to 23. From the summer schedules of 1988, R√∏rvik was included in Wider√∏e's services along the Helgeland coast. The airport had 7,244 passengers in 1988, and the combined subsidies per passengers was . This included in state operating subsidies to the airport, in addition to an operating deficit of covered by the municipality. From 1996, Ryum and 25 other regional airports were taken over by the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor). The airport had 17,000 passengers in 1999. Four years after the nationalization, the CAA proposed that Ryum and certain other regional airport be closed in an effort to reduce costs, but this was disapproved by the government. The airport received a renewed certification by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2001, which in addition to new runway lighting required the airport to have a rescue boat. The ministry started a process in 2001 to consider using smaller aircraft than the 37-seat Dash 8 aircraft. The reason was that there were on average only 17 passengers per flight from R√∏rvik and Namsos Airport, H√∏knes√∏ra combined. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Since 2010, Nord-Tr√∏ndelag County Municipality has been pressing for an extension of the runway to and construction of a larger hangar. Facilities The airport is located at Ryumsj√∏en in N√¶r√∏ysund, south of R√∏rvik. Paid parking, taxis and car rental are available, but there is no bus service available to the airport. Ryum's catchment area includes N√¶r√∏y. The airfield's elevation is above mean sea level and it has a runway aligned 04‚Äì22 (roughly northeast‚Äìsouthwest).

MSB is a non-profit, private, statewide resource center providing outreach, educational and residential programs. Over 65% of the 2,000 students identified in Maryland as blind or visually impaired are served by the school every year.  On Campus Programs  Early Learning Program  The Early Learning Program provides instruction for children with visual impairment ages birth to five years, within two programs; Infants & Toddlers, and the center-based programs including both Preschool and Kindergarten. The Preschool and Kindergarten program serves children, ages three through five years of age. The purpose of the program is to promote readiness for school- age programs in the most integrative setting possible. Typically developing students, without disabilities, are included as an integral part of the daily program. Activities and materials from the curriculum are modified to meet the Maryland Early Learning Standards and support the development and learning of all students. The program is licensed through the Office of Child Care.  General Academic Program  The MSB General Academic Program, serves students who are on an academic diploma track. Students also receive direct instruction in functional academic skills as well as in the areas of the Expanded Core Curriculum for students who are blind or visually impaired. The program is designed to address specific skill needs of students, address learning issues and facilitate a successful return to their local school system. The General Academic Program follows an academic curriculum based on the Maryland College and Career Ready Standards.  Functional Academic Program  The MSB Functional Academic Program consists of a full complement of programming to meet the educational and social needs of students who are blind and visually impaired. Vocational training is emphasized. Academic instruction is presented at a student's instructional level and is based on significantly modified content standards. Students also receive instruction in the content areas of the expanded core curriculum for the blind and visually impaired learners.  Program for Students who are Blind with Multiple Disabilities  The MSB Program for Students who are Blind with Multiple Disabilities, serves students with severe and profound disabilities with emphasis on functional life skills, including communication, and a strong multi-sensory approach to learning. The Unique Learning System based on Common Core standards is used. Students also receive instruction in content areas of the expanded core curriculum for blind and visually impaired learners. The educational program takes into consideration the complex health and physical needs of each student, while developing age-appropriate adaptive skills to increase independence. This program also includes students with dual sensory impairments of both hearing and vision.  Program for Students who are Blind with Autism  The MSB Program for Students who are Blind with Autism, serves students with disorders of communicating and relating, including those on the Autism Spectrum. Emphasis is placed on functional life-skills and communication and learning is supported in highly structured, sensory controlled environments. The Unique Learning System based on Common Core standards is used. Students also receive instruction in content areas of the expanded core curriculum for blind and visually impaired learners.  Athletics  Athletics field and gymnasium at the school MSB offers wrestling, track and field, and \\"goalball\\" (a variation of handball for the blind). In 2019, MBS began soccer as a varsity sport on a specially designed field with kickboards on the sidelines to keep the ball in play. The game is further adapted for the visually impaired by having the ball weighted with ball bearings to produce a jingling sound the players can hear. They must shout \\"voy\\" to alert other players to their location. Only the goalie is sighted. MSBl began developing blind soccer under former school president Michael Bina in 2017, hosting the first North American Blind Soccer Training Camp in 2018. After two years of training and practice, MSBl played the first actual game against the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind, on September 24, 2019. Players on the Maryland team, the \\"Bees\\", said afterwards that they enjoyed the camaraderie, sportsmanship, and fun playing soccer.  Residency  MSB is a co-ed day and residential school located on a 95-acre campus in northeast Baltimore. The campus includes academic, residential and recreational facilities for students who are blind, visually impaired and multiply-disabled. The dorms at MSB are called ‚Äúcottages‚Äù. Each cottage houses six to eight students and consists of bedrooms with 2 beds and a bathroom in each. Each student typically has a roommate. The common area consists of a living room, dining room and kitchen. The cottages are occupied and supervised by residential staff members including child and youth care specialists who assist the students with daily living routines. Approximately one half of the enrolled students live on campus during the school week, while the other half are day students who commute to and from the school on a daily basis.  Presidents  MSB has had thirteen leaders since its founding in 1853, including the current and 13th leader, William Robert Hair. With the appointment of W. Robert Hair, the title has been changed from \\"President\\" to \\"Superintendent\\" to assuage confusion as to the role he plays at the institution. This reflects back to earlier roots of the school as the first few presidents were called superintendents. The 12th, and previous president was Michael J. Bina. When the school opened up in 1853, David E. Loughery was the first superintendent followed by Frederick Douglas Morrison for forty years and then John Francis Bledsoe for thirty-six years. Eventually, Herbert J. Wolfe became a superintendent and then Dr. Richard L. Welsh after him. The 10th president/superintendent was Louis M. Tutt and the 11th was Elaine Sveen.

Dirksen was nicknamed the \\"Pope of Punk.\\" Dirksen was born in Braunschweig, Germany and immigrated to the US in 1948. He was a nephew of United States Senator Everett Dirksen. He served in the Army, briefly attended San Jose State University, and entered the entertainment business in the late 1950s, hosting a live television show called Rocket to Stardom. He then worked as a tour manager for several 1960s rock and soul acts. In 1974, he began to book acts at the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco's North Beach, and began booking local punk acts (The Nuns, The Sheets, Crime, Mary Monday, etc.) along with soon-to-be-famous national and international talent, such as Blondie, The Ramones, Devo, Black Flag, and The Dead Kennedys. From 1979 to 1982, he wrote and directed Amapola Presents Show, a weekly magazine‚Äìvariety show on KEMO-TV, Channel 20. The show starred Filipina superstar Amapola with co-host Ness Aquino‚ÄîMabuhay Gardens' owner. Amapola Presents Show became Dirk Dirksen's showcase for local punk acts, local Bay Area bands and artists, and a group of Bay Area actors called \\"The Straight People.\\" Dirksen gained some negative notoriety for allegedly ripping off SoCal punk rock bands Youth Brigade and Social Distortion while on their independent summer 1982 tour, and further taunting them by giving them rolls of pennies, as documented in the documentary Another State of Mind. After leaving the Mabuhay Gardens, he operated the On Broadway nightclub just upstairs from the Mabuhay. When the On Broadway was closed in 1984, Dirksen went into video production with his firm, Dirksen-Molloy Productions, which he owned with his domestic partner Damon Molloy. Dirksen was also active with the organization H.E.A.R. (Hearing Education and Awareness for Rockers). In April 2006, he hosted a Mabuhay reunion event at the Fillmore Auditorium, featuring members of the Dead Kennedys, The Mutants, Flipper, and The Contractions. Later that year, he died in his sleep of an apparent heart attack at age 69. On November 12, 2008, an official measure was passed to rename Rowland Alley ‚Äî on Broadway between Kearney and Montgomery ‚Äî for him. In 2009, along with a street sign reading \\"Dirk Dirksen Place,\\" a plaque was placed at 433 Broadway, the former site of the Mabuhay Gardens nightclub Dirksen once managed.

There is widespread agreement that a reduction in the number of animals used and the refinement of testing to reduce suffering should be important goals for the industries involved.R E Hester R M Harrison et al. Alternatives To Animal Testing (Issues in Environmental Science and Technology) Royal Society of Chemistry; 1 edition (June 7, 2006) Two major alternatives to in vivo animal testing are in vitro cell culture techniques and in silico computer simulation. However, some claim they are not true alternatives because simulations use data from prior animal experiments and cell cultures often require animal derived products, such as serum or cells. Others say that they cannot replace animals completely as they are unlikely to ever provide enough information about the complex interactions of living systems. Other alternatives include the use of humans for skin irritancy tests and donated human blood for pyrogenicity studies. Another alternative is so-called microdosing, in which the basic behaviour of drugs is assessed using human volunteers receiving doses well below those expected to produce whole-body effects. While microdosing produces important information about pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics it does not reveal information about toxicity or toxicology. Furthermore, it was noted by the Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments that despite the use of microdosing, \\"animal studies will still be required\\". Guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing are the Three Rs (3Rs) first described by Russell and Burch in 1959.Russell, W.M.S. and Burch, R.L., (1959). The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique, Methuen, London. These principles are now followed in many testing establishments worldwide. #Replacement refers to the preferred use of non-animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aim. #Reduction refers to methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals, or to obtain more information from the same number of animals. #Refinement refers to methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering, or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals used. Types Cell culture and tissue engineering tissue culture dish Cell culture can be an alternative to animal use in some cases. For example, cultured cells have been developed to create monoclonal antibodies; prior to this, production required animals to undergo a procedure likely to cause pain and distress. However, even though cell or tissue culture methods may reduce the number of experiments performed on intact animals, the maintenance of cells in culture normally requires the use of animal-derived serum. Although exact figures are difficult to obtain, some have estimated that one million fetal cows are sacrificed each year to obtain the world's supply of fetal bovine serum, used to grow cultured cells. The testing of cosmetic products directly onto an animal can be minimized or eliminated by the use of in Vitro cell growth and development. This can be generalized as the growth of cells outside of the body and tested on without causing harm or pain on the test subject. Much of the time this method of cosmetic testing is less time consuming and less expensive than alternative choices. Skin corrosion and skin irritation Skin irritation and skin corrosion refer to localized toxic effects resulting from a topical exposure of the skin to a substance. Human skin equivalent tests can be used to replace animal-based corrosive and irritative studies. EpiDerm from Mattek and EpiSkin and SkinEthic RHE model are derived from human skin cells which have been cultured to produce a model of human skin. These methods are currently accepted replacements in Canada and the European Union (EU). In August 2010, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published the Test Guideline 439 which describes the new procedure for in vitro hazard identification of irritant chemicals. Another synthetic replacement uses a protein membrane to simulate a skin barrier and is approved as a partial replacement by the US Department of Transportation and European Union. Skin absorption Several tissue culture methods that measure the rate of chemical absorption by the skin have been approved by the OECD. Several tissue culture methods which measure the rate of chemical absorption by the skin have been approved by the OECD; this information was found from here https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&pg;=PA232&dq;=Several+tissue+culture+methods+which+measure+the+rate+of+chemical+absorption+by+the+skin+have+been+approved+by+the+OECD+instead+of+animal+testing&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiqwPyNhuXcAhUUVsAKHXkRDhYQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q;=Several%20tissue%20culture%20methods%20which%20measure%20the%20rate%20of%20chemical%20absorption%20by%20the%20skin%20have%20been%20approved%20by%20the%20OECD%20instead%20of%20animal%20testing&f;=false or from the book version (not digital) Biotechnology Fundamentals By Firdos Alam Khan Phototoxicity Phototoxicity is a rash, swelling, or inflammation, like a severe sunburn, caused by exposure to light following exposure to a chemical. The 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) Phototoxicity Test, approved by the OECD, detects the viability of 3T3 cells after exposure to a chemical in the presence or absence of light. Although originally derived from a mouse embryo, the 3T3 cell line was developed in 1962 Healthy and diseased tissue can be donated from humans for toxicity testing and computer models of the heart, lung, and musculoskeletal systems can be used based on existing mathematical based data.N.A. (2017). https://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/why-we-do-it/alternatives-animal- testing. Human-based Skin irritation A skinpatch test has been designed and is used in Canada to measure development of rashes, inflammation, swelling or abnormal tissue growth on human volunteers.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&pg;=PA232&lpg;=PA232&dq;=Skin+patch+test+in+canada+to+measure+development+of+rashes+as+a+substitute+to+animals+testing&source;=bl&ots;=y68uvAoNtu&sig;=G0RuSWJM1Xh3KLh_lWS- eO5PZ0I&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjQpf3RhOXcAhWMKMAKHSxUB0MQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q;=Skin%20patch%20test%20in%20canada%20to%20measure%20development%20of%20rashes%20as%20a%20substitute%20to%20animals%20testing&f;=false Found from google books but can be found also in the book Biotechnology Fundamentals By Firdos Alam Khan Unlike corrosives, substances defined as irritants cause only reversible skin damage. Another approach has been the development of test methods that use cultured human cells. Human epidermal keratinocytes have been cultured to mimic the human epidermis, and are used to measure skin irritation and dermal corrosion. This method has been accepted by the EU and is intended to replace the Draize rabbit skin irritation test. Pyrogenicity Pyrogens are most often pharmaceutical products or intravenous drugs that may cause inflammation or fever when they interact with immune system cells. This interaction can be quickly and accurately tested in vitro. Modular immune in vitro construct The modular immune in vitro construct (MIMIC) uses human cells to create a model of the human immune system on which the efficacy of new vaccines and other compounds may be tested, replacing some steps of the vaccine development process that would otherwise be performed on animals. This process is faster and more flexible than previous methods but critics worry that it may be too simple to be useful on a large scale.  Computer simulation  Crash test dummies have been used to replace live animals in impact testing. Examples of computer simulations available include models of asthma, (from internet archive) though potential new medicines identified using these techniques are currently still required to be verified in animal and human tests before licensing. Computer operated mannequins, also known as crash test dummies, complete with internal sensors and video, have replaced live animal trauma testing for automobile crash testing. The first of these was \\"Sierra Sam\\" built in 1949 by Alderson Research Labs (ARL) Sierra Engineering. These dummies continue to be refined. Prior to this, live pigs were used as test subjects for crash testing. Computer models have been constructed to model human metabolism, to study plaque build-up and cardiovascular risk, and to evaluate toxicity of drugs, tasks for which animals are also used. In 2007, US researchers using the world's fastest computer at the time, BlueGene L, modeled half a mouse brain for just 10 seconds. However, due to limitations in computing power, the simulation could only be run at 1/10th the speed of an actual mouse brain. Although this was an advance in science, its representative power as a model was limited and the researchers were quoted as saying that \\"although the simulation shared some similarities with a mouse's mental make-up in terms of nerves and connections it lacked the structures seen in real mice brains.\\" For pharmacology and toxicology, physiologically based pharmacokinetic models are much used for in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of alternative testing. Medical imaging Medical imaging is able to demonstrate to researchers both how drugs are metabolized by use of microdosing, and the detailed condition of organ tissue. Microfluidic Chip Microfluidic chip, which is just 2 cm wide, have engraved into a series of small chambers, each containing a sample of tissue from different parts of the body. A substitute of blood flows through micro-channels where the compartments of chips linked by. When injected, test drug circulates around the device, mimicking what goes in the body on a micro scale. Sensors in the chip transfer information for computer analysis. Another name for this chip is the microfluidic chip is cell-bio chips. With the capacity to ‚Äúperform perfusion culture‚Äù and reproduce ‚Äúphysiological conditions such three-dimensional architectures, circulatory flowrate and zonation and multi cellular co-cultures,‚Äù the biochips have set themselves apart from basic cell cultures analyzed in a petri dish. The effectiveness of these systems is constantly being increased with various new materials that can be used to make it. An ideal material would be gas permeable but still be able to absorb molecules that would be expected to be found in various drugs The choice of the material for chips is still challenging. One of the major materials that can be possibly used in chips is known as Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). However, due to lack of facilities for mass production and drug clearance issue, the use of PDMS is still being speculated, even though it has great properties as microfluidic chip. Also, the biological process involved in proliferation and metabolism might be modified when compared to larger scales, because the materials have micro- structured scales comparable in size to cells. Fungal model for mammalian drug metabolism Fungi like Cunninghamella elegans can be used as a microbial model of mammalian drug metabolism thereby reducing the need for laboratory animals. Prokaryotes are often used as an alternative to animal testing. Prokaryotes include different bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E. Coli) or Bacillus subtilis. These bacteria are the ideal model for genetic and molecular studies. Fungi is also used as an alternative for animal testing. Certain fungi can be used for genetic studies or circadian rhythms studies. This may include neurospora crassa, otherwise known as a type of red mold. Invertebrates are another ideal candidate for testing. One of the most common invertebrates tested on include drosophila melangaster, the fruit fly. Fruit flies are used to find human diseases. Fruit flies and humans are more alike in their composition that one would think and this is proven within these studies. Future alternatives Organs on a chip The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering (US) intends to develop in-vitro organs for drug screening and thereby eliminate the use of animals for this type of testing. One model is the \\"lung-on-a-chip\\". This combines microfabrication techniques with modern tissue engineering and mimics the complicated mechanical and biochemical behaviours of a human lung. Human toxome Toxicity testing typically involves studying adverse health outcomes in animals subjected to high doses of toxicants with subsequent extrapolation to expected human responses at lower doses. The system relies on the use of a 40+year-old patchwork of animal tests that are expensive (costing more than $3B per year), time-consuming, low-throughput and often provide results of limited predictive value for human health effects. The low-throughput of current toxicity testing approaches (which are largely the same for industrial chemicals, pesticides and drugs) has led to a backlog of more than 80,000 chemicals to which humans are potentially exposed whose potential toxicity remains largely unknown. In 2007, the National Research Council (NRC) released the report \\"Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy\\", that charted a long-range strategic plan for transforming toxicity testing. The major components of the plan include the use of predictive, high- throughput cell-based assays (of human origin) to evaluate perturbations in key toxicity pathways, and to conduct targeted testing against those pathways. This approach will greatly accelerate our ability to test the vast \\"storehouses\\" of chemical compounds using a rational, risk-based approach to chemical prioritization, and provide test results that are hopefully far more predictive of human toxicity than current methods. Although a number of toxicity pathways have already been identified, most are only partially known and no common annotation exists. Mapping the entirety of these pathways (i.e. the Human Toxome ) will be a large-scale effort, perhaps on the order of the Human Genome Project. Research initiatives SEURAT-1 SEURAT-1 is a long term strategic target for \\"Safety Evaluation Ultimately Replacing Animal Testing\\". It is called \\"SEURAT-1\\" to indicate that more steps have to be taken before the final goal will be reached. SEURAT-1 will develop knowledge and technology building blocks required for the development of solutions for the replacement of current repeated dose systemic toxicity testing in vivo used for the assessment of human safety. SEURAT-1 is composed of six research projects, which started on January 1, 2011 and will run for five years. These projects will closely cooperate with a common goal and combine the research efforts of over 70 European universities, public research institutes and companies. The collaboration between these six research projects, the dissemination of results, the cooperation with other international research teams, and the continuous updating on research priorities will be facilitated by the coordination and support action project \\"COACH\\". SEURAT-1 was developed through the Framework Programme 7 (FP7) research initiative and was created through a call for proposals by the European Commission (EC) that was published in June 2009. The Cosmetics Europe industry offered to match the EC's funds to make a total of EUR 50 million available to try to fill current gaps in scientific knowledge and accelerate the development of non-animal test methods. Euroecotox Laboratory animals are not restricted to rats, mice, dogs, and rabbits, but also include fish, frogs and birds. Research into alternatives to replace these species is often neglected, although fish are the third most widely used laboratory animal used for scientific purposes in the EU. This is also the field where until now only two alternative tests exist worldwide: One guideline, OECD TG 236, and one guidance (OECD series on testing and assessment 126) are so far available. Euroecotox is a European network for alternative testing strategies in ecotoxicology. It was funded by the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission Environment Programme. The main objectives of the Euroecotox network are: To contribute to the advancement of alternative methods of ecotoxicity testing in Europe. To promote the validation and regulatory acceptance of new alternative ecotoxicity methods. To facilitate the networking of research groups working in the field of alternative ecotoxicology. To provide a gathering point for all stakeholders involved in the development, validation, regulatory acceptance and final use of alternative ecotoxicity testing strategies. To act as the one voice for alternative ecotoxicity testing in Europe. AXLR8 AXLR8 is a coordination action funded by the European Commission Directorate General for Research & Innovation under the 7 Framework Programme 7 (FP7) Health Theme. The European Commission is currently funding a number of research consortia to develop new 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) test methods and strategies as potential alternatives to the use of animals in safety testing. Monitoring of these 3Rs activities at pan-European, national, and international levels is vital to facilitate swift progress. AXLR8 aims to fulfill this growing need by providing a focal point for dialogue and collaboration. Humane Society International is part of the consortium. Scientific congresses The European Society for Alternatives to Animal Testing (EUSAAT) organises an annual conference in Linz (Austria) for # Dissemination and validation of alternative methods to animal testing # Promotion of research in the field of the 3Rs # Reduction of the use of animals for tests in the field of education and continuing education # Reduction of suffering and stress of laboratory animals by better breeding, keeping, test planning and other accompanying measures # Experts' guidance and referees' opinion for public and private organizations, companies, universities # Suitable information for the public and the media The World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences takes place every three years. The next conference (10th) will be held in September 2017 in Seattle. The 1st Latino-Americano Congress on Alternative to Animal Testing took place in 2012. Colama (I Congresso Latino-Americano De Metodos Alternativos Ao Uso De Animais No Ensino, Pesquisa E Industria). Industry and corporate initiatives * Cosmetics Europe: Represents the interests of more than 4000 companies in the cosmetic, toiletry and perfumery industry since 1962. *Unilever: \\"We do not test finished products on animals unless demanded by the regulatory authorities in the few countries where this is the law. In such cases, we try to convince the local authorities to change the law. Where some testing of ingredients is required by law or currently unavoidable, we aim to minimise the number of animals used.\\" *BASF: \\"Systematic screening investigations provide information about important toxicological properties of substances at an early stage of development. ... We replace animal experiments whenever an alternative method is available that complies with an OECD Test Guideline and is recognized by the authorities.\\" Legislation EU Directive 2010/63/EU On January 1, 2013, EU Directive 2010/63/EU \\"on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes\\" entered into force for the EU Member States (MS), repealing Directive 86/609/EEC. Because it is a Directive, it allows Member States certain flexibility in transposition of national rules. The status of the implementation of the new Directive in the EU is described by the EC General Environment Directorate. :Article 1.3: The new EU Directive applies to the following animals: (a) live non-human vertebrate animals, including: (i) independently feeding larval forms; and (ii) foetal forms of mammals from the last third of their normal development; (b) live cephalopods. :Article 4: The Directive refers directly to the 3Rs: \\"Principle of replacement, reduction and refinement\\". :Article 47-2: Member States shall assist the Commission in identifying and nominating suitable specialised and qualified laboratories to carry out such validation studies. In July 2013, the Commission announced the creation of NETVAL (European Union Network of Laboratories for the Validation of Alternative Methods). EU-NETVAL's primary role is to provide support for EURL ECVAM validation projects, including aspects of training and dissemination, and the identification of methods that have a potential to reduce, refine or replace animals used for scientific purposes. Currently there are 13 test facilities in 9 Member States: Germany (3), The Netherlands (2), Spain (2), Belgium (1), Czech Republic (1), Finland (1), France (1), Italy (1) and Sweden (1). EU cosmetic regulation The Cosmetics Directive provides the regulatory framework for the phasing out of animal testing for cosmetics purposes. It establishes prohibitions against (a) testing finished cosmetic products and cosmetic ingredients on animals (testing ban), and (b) marketing in the EU finished cosmetic products and ingredients included in cosmetic products which were tested on animals for cosmetics purposes (marketing ban). The same provisions are contained in Cosmetics Regulation EU 1223/2009, which replaces the Cosmetics Directive as of July 11, 2013. EU chemical policy: REACH In 2007, EU legislation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH EC 1907/2006) came into force, relating to chemicals and their safe use. The aim of REACH is to improve the protection of human health and the environment through the better and earlier identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. It promotes the use of alternative methods for animal testing, but does not oblige the test performer to do so; Article 25.1 - In order to avoid animal testing, testing on vertebrate animals for the purposes of this Regulation shall be undertaken only as a last resort. It is also necessary to take measures limiting duplication of other tests. EU test methods regulation In parallel to the adoption of REACH, the EC published standardised and accepted methods for testing hazardous properties of chemicals. These were written into the \\"Test Methods Regulation\\". All the alternative test methods among the in vivo studies are included in PART B; \\"The European Union is committed to promoting the development and validation of alternative techniques which can provide the same level of information as current animal tests, but which use fewer animals, cause less suffering or avoid the use of animals completely. Such methods, as they become available, must be considered wherever possible for hazard characterisation and consequent classification and labeling for intrinsic hazards and chemical safety assessment.\\" EU Regulation for Food Additives, Food Enzymes, and Food Flavourings EU philosophy on food additives, food enzymes, and food flavourings and ingredients intended for human consumption is that none should be put on the market unless they are included on a published Community list of authorised substances, in accordance with the conditions laid down in relevant food law. This approach is intended to bring food producers into compliance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) 1334/2008 that pertain to the safety of food flavourings. As part of the approval process, the EC will require full disclosure of study data, safety issues, and toxicological findings for all such additives. Within the EU animal welfare law (2010/63/EU), the principles of the 3Rs are invoked whenever toxicological test methods are necessary.

ICCR: The International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation (ICCR) is an international group of cosmetic regulatory authorities from the United States (FDA), Japan (Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare), the EU (EC, DG Enterprise), and Canada (Health Canada). This multilateral framework maintains the highest level of global consumer protection, while minimizing barriers to international trade. OECD The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development) is a forum for discussion where governments express their points of view, share their experiences, and search for common ground, as opposed to a supranational organization. OECD is a forum where alternative test methods also undergo validation and are therereafter accepted for regulatory purposes in more than 35 member countries worldwide. NGOs are represented at the technical level at the OECD, under the ICOPA International Council on Animal Protection in OECD program. The testing of chemicals is labor-intensive and expensive. Often the same chemical is tested in several countries simultaneously, which means that redundant animal tests are performed. To relieve some of this burden, the OECD Council adopted a decision in 1981, stating that data generated in a member country, in accordance with OECD Test Guidelines and Principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), shall be accepted in other member countries for assessment purposes and other uses relating to the protection of human health and the environment. This principle is referred to using the acronym MAD, for the Mutual Acceptance of Data.

History On August 16, 1856, the Texas Legislature enacted a measure providing for the establishment of a Texas Asylum for the Blind in Austin. The state leased the Neill‚ÄìCochran House as a temporary site for the asylum while a permanent campus was constructed. The asylum facility was designed and built by Abner H. Cook, a local architect who had recently designed both the Neill‚ÄìCochran House and the Texas Governor's Mansion. In 1857 the asylum moved into its new campus (now the University of Texas at Austin's Little Campus), where it operated until the end of the American Civil War in 1865. After having its facility commandeered by Reconstruction forces for a year, the asylum was reopened in 1866 and occupied its original campus from then until 1915, while the program was renamed the Texas Blind Institute in 1905 and then the Texas School for the Blind in 1915. During World War I the School for the Blind was displaced by a military pilot training program, and it relocated to its current campus in 1917. The state transferred control of the school to the Texas Education Agency in 1953, from which point the School for the Blind became a self- contained school district. In the late 1960s the school was integrated with the all-black Texas Blind and Deaf School. In 1989 the program was renamed the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired. Student body 50% of the school's students are of high school age. TSBVI may take up to 150 boarding students. Usually, deaf students in Texas attend school in their local school districts, which are obligated to educate them under the law. Students who attend TSBVI do so only after their parents and their schools and school districts all agree that TSBVI is best-equipped for their education.Colloff, Pamela. \\"Out of Sight\\" (Archive).

She is a psychic and has the gift of seeing into the future of anybody. After her break up with boyfriend Manav (Abhishek Bachchan) who truly loved her but had to move away to a different city, Drishti moves to a small remote village, where she meets Mohit (Sunil Shetty), an eccentric car mechanic who needs psychiatric treatment due to years of abuse at the hands of his father. Mohit has a crush on Drishti, which Drishti is unaware of. She performs the job of Tarot card reading to locals, one of her customers being Rhea Trehan (Neha Dhupia).

The warlocks may be real, purported or legendary persons. The source of the witchcraft is often attributed to a legendary encounter between Basque navigator Jos√© de Moraleda y Montero and Huilliche machi Chillpila who defeated Moraleda in a duel of witchcraft obtaining a book of European magic as reward. Belief in witchcraft has been common in the archipelago reaching such influence, that in 1880 Chilean authorities put on trial warlocks said to rule the archipelago through a secret society.  Related works  There is currently a character in Chile known as \\"El Brujo\\" (see El Brujo (cartoon) ), which originally appeared in the Caleuche Comic magazine and now appears in the pages of the magazine Heroes . It is a rather loose and self-centered superhero, whose powers and abilities are based on Chiloe witchcraft. The macu√± is here a layer, and its allies are an invunche (that contrary to the legend is a very intelligent being, for being a failed experiment, as he himself explains) and a flying one (that also, contrary to the legend, is young and beautiful, for the same reason). In 2014, the Chilean visual artist Patricio Paretti made the animated television series \\"Magallanes, un cuento m√°gico\\", aired by UMAGTV , which had as its central character \\"Don Eleuterio\\", a Chiloe Warlock who lived in Punta Arenas and who he told supernatural stories that happened in Chilean Patagonia. The audiovisual work was inspired by various local beliefs, mainly myths, legends and witchcraft from the Big Island of Chilo√© . In one of the episodes, \\"The bowels of death\\", a witch uses a macu√± or magic breastplate both to fly, to become bad light, as well as to become an animal. The macu√± is shown as a stylized piece of leather similar to a corset, made with baby skin and horsehair threads. The same episode makes mention of hexes with cemetery land, a vital element for the realization of black magic by sorcerers. References * Martinez Vilches, Oscar, Chilo√© Misterioso (in Spanish).

They are called 'anantarika' because they are 'an' (without) 'antara' (interval), in other words the results immediately come to fruition in the next life, i.e. the participant goes straight to hell. These are considered so heinous that even non-Buddhists must avoid them. According to Buddhism, committing such a crime would prevent the perpetrator from attaining the stages of sotƒÅpanna, sakadagami, anƒÅgƒÅmi or arhat in that lifetime. The five crimes are:Triplegem glossary * Intentionally murdering one's father. * Intentionally murdering one's mother. * Killing an Arhat (fully enlightened being). * Shedding the blood of a Buddha. * Creating a schism within the Sangha, the community of Buddhist monks, nuns and pari·π£ƒÅ who try to attain enlightenment. In Mahayana Buddhism these five crimes are referred to as pa√±cƒÅnantarya and are mentioned in \\"The Sutra Preached by the Buddha on the Total Extinction of the Dharma\\".  Devadatta  Devadatta is noted for attempting to kill the Sakyamuni Buddha on several occasions including: * Throwing a large rock at him. Devadatta missed, but a splinter from the rock drew blood from the Buddha's foot. * Inciting an elephant to charge at the Buddha. The Buddha was able to pacify the elephant by directing MettƒÅ to it. According to Sutta Pitaka, after trying to kill Sakyamuni Buddha a number of times, Devadatta set up his own Buddhist monastic order by splitting the (sangha). During his efforts to become the leader of his own Sangha, he proposed five extra-strict rules for monks, which he knew Buddha would not allow. Devadatta's reasoning was that after he had proposed those rules and Buddha had not allowed them, Devadatta could claim that he did follow and practice these five rules, making him a better and purer monk. One of these five extra rules required monks to be vegetarian. In the Contemplation Sutra, Devadatta is said to have convinced Prince Ajatasattu to murder his father King Bimbisara and ascend the throne. Ajatasattu follows the advice, and this action prevents him from attaining enlightenment at a later time, when listening to a teaching of the Buddha. Devadatta is the only individual from the early Buddhist tradition to have committed three anantarika-karmas.  King Suppabuddha  King Suppabuddha was the father of Devadatta and YasodharƒÅ and the father-in-law of Prince Siddhattha. One day Suppabuddha blocked the Buddha's path, refused to make way, and sent a message saying, \\"I cannot give way to the Buddha, who is so much younger than I\\". Finding the road blocked, the Buddha and the bhikkhus turned back. As the Buddha turned back, he said to Ananda, \\"Because the king has refused to give way to a Buddha, he has committed a bad kamma and before long he will have to face the consequences\\". It is said that the king died on the seventh day after that event had taken place. He fell down the stairs, collapsed and died and was born in a suffering state, being unable to escape the effects of his evil kamma (according to Buddhist belief).IX:12 King Suppabuddha blocks the Buddha's path According to the Buddha's prediction the earth swallowed him. It is said, \\"So the king went down the stairs and as soon as he stepped on the earth, it opened and swallowed him up and dragged him right down to Avici Niraya.\\"Dhammapada Verse 128 Suppabuddhasakya Vatthu  Karma  Anyone who commits an anantarika-karma will go to hell. The five different actions which each constitute an anantarika-karma are the only actions which can produce a definite result.See Ven. Pesala's exposition on Hell Accounts claim that toward the end of Devadatta's life, he was struck by a severe remorse caused by his past misdeeds and did indeed manage to approach the Buddha and retook refuge in the Triple Gem, dying shortly afterwards.Sarvastivada text the event creating a schism in the Sangha Because of the gravity of his actions, he was condemned to suffer for several hundred millennia in Avici. However, it was also said that he would eventually be admitted into the heavens as a Pratyekabuddha due to his past merits prior to his corruption. In the Sama√±√±aphala Sutta, Gautama Buddha said that if Ajatasattu hadn't killed his father, he would have attained sotapannahood, a degree of enlightenment. But because he had killed his father he could not attain it.Buddha say King Ajatasattu asking five grave offenses sutra See also * Buddhist views on sin * Devadatta * Karma in Buddhism * Merit (Buddhism) * Mortal sin (Christian version) * Pratitya-samutpada * Samsara (Buddhism) * Twelve Nidanas References Further reading * Silk, Jonathan A.

He spent most of his medical career at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London. Cockayne was particularly interested in endocrinology, and rare, genetic diseases of children. In 1946 he recognized a disease that would be named after him, called Cockayne's syndrome. This is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by dwarfism, pigmentary retinopathy, impaired nervous system development, and facial abnormalities. This disease has since been divided into three subtypes: * Cockayne syndrome I, or Classic Cockayne Syndrome: in which facial and somatic abnormalities develop during childhood. Due to progressive neurological degeneration, death occurs in the second or third decade. * Cockayne syndrome II, or Severe Cockayne Syndrome: in which facial and somatic abnormalities are present at birth. Death usually results by the age of seven. * Cockayne syndrome III: milder than Cockayne I & II, and its onset happens later than the other two types. In 1933 he published the \\"Inherited Abnormalities of the Skin and its Appendages\\". This was the first book that dealt exclusively with genodermatoses (inherited skin disorders). Besides his medical work, Cockayne was an entomologist. He amassed a large collection of butterflies and moths, which in 1947 was donated to the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum at Tring, Hertfordshire. In 1943 he became president of the Royal Entomological Society of London.

In C and C++, constructs such as pointer type conversion and \`union\` ‚Äî C++ adds reference type conversion and \`reinterpret_cast\` to this list ‚Äî are provided in order to permit many kinds of type punning, although some kinds are not actually supported by the standard language. In the Pascal programming language, the use of records with variants may be used to treat a particular data type in more than one manner, or in a manner not normally permitted.  Sockets example  One classic example of type punning is found in the Berkeley sockets interface. The function to bind an opened but uninitialized socket to an IP address is declared as follows: int bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *my_addr, socklen_t addrlen); The \`bind\` function is usually called as follows: struct sockaddr_in sa = {0}; int sockfd = ...; sa.sin_family = AF_INET; sa.sin_port = htons(port); bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&sa;, sizeof sa); The Berkeley sockets library fundamentally relies on the fact that in C, a pointer to \`struct sockaddr_in\` is freely convertible to a pointer to \`struct sockaddr\`; and, in addition, that the two structure types share the same memory layout. Therefore, a reference to the structure field \`my_addr->sin_family\` (where \`my_addr\` is of type \`struct sockaddr*\`) will actually refer to the field \`sa.sin_family\` (where \`sa\` is of type \`struct sockaddr_in\`). In other words, the sockets library uses type punning to implement a rudimentary form of polymorphism or inheritance. Often seen in the programming world is the use of \\"padded\\" data structures to allow for the storage of different kinds of values in what is effectively the same storage space. This is often seen when two structures are used in mutual exclusivity for optimization.  Floating-point example  Not all examples of type punning involve structures, as the previous example did. Suppose we want to determine whether a floating-point number is negative. We could write: bool is_negative(float x) { return x < 0.0; } However, supposing that floating- point comparisons are expensive, and also supposing that \`float\` is represented according to the IEEE floating-point standard, and integers are 32 bits wide, we could engage in type punning to extract the sign bit of the floating-point number using only integer operations: bool is_negative(float x) { unsigned int *ui = (unsigned int *)&x; return *ui & 0x80000000; } Note that the behaviour will not be exactly the same: in the special case of \`x\` being negative zero, the first implementation yields \`false\` while the second yields \`true\`. This kind of type punning is more dangerous than most. Whereas the former example relied only on guarantees made by the C programming language about structure layout and pointer convertibility, the latter example relies on assumptions about a particular system's hardware. Some situations, such as time-critical code that the compiler otherwise fails to optimize, may require dangerous code. In these cases, documenting all such assumptions in comments, and introducing static assertions to verify portability expectations, helps to keep the code maintainable. For a practical example popularized by Quake III, see fast inverse square root. In addition to the assumption about bit-representation of floating-point numbers, the previous floating-point type-punning example also violates the C language's constraints on how objects are accessed:ISO/IEC 9899:1999 s6.5/7 the declared type of \`x\` is \`float\` but it is read through an expression of type \`unsigned int\`. On many common platforms, this use of pointer punning can create problems if different pointers are aligned in machine-specific ways. Furthermore, pointers of different sizes can alias accesses to the same memory, causing problems that are unchecked by the compiler. Use of \`union\` It is a common mistake to attempt to fix type-punning by the use of a \`union\`. (Additionally, this example still makes the assumption about IEEE-754 bit-representation of floating-point types.) bool is_negative(float x) { union { unsigned int ui; float d; } my_union = { .d = x }; return my_union.ui & 0x80000000; } Accessing \`my_union.ui\` after initializing the other member, \`my_union.d\`, is still a form of type-punning in C and the result is unspecified behavior (and undefined behavior in C++ ISO/IEC 14882:2011 Section 9.5). The language of ¬ß 6.5/7 can be misread to imply that reading alternative union members is permissible. However, the text is \\"An object shall have its stored value accessed only by‚Ä¶\\". It is a limiting expression, not a statement that all possible union members may be accessed regardless of which was last stored. So, the use of the \`union\` avoids none of the issues with simply punning a pointer directly. Some compilers like GCC support such non-standard constructs as a language extension.GCC: Non-Bugs For another example of type punning, see Stride of an array. Pascal A variant record permits treating a data type as multiple kinds of data depending on which variant is being referenced. In the following example, integer is presumed to be 16 bit, while longint and real are presumed to be 32, while character is presumed to be 8 bit: type VariantRecord = record case RecType : LongInt of 1: (I : array[1..2] of Integer); (* not show here: there can be several variables in a variant record's case statement *) 2: (L : LongInt ); 3: (R : Real ); 4: (C : array[1..4] of Char ); end; var V : VariantRecord; K : Integer; LA : LongInt; RA : Real; Ch : Character; V.I[1] := 1; Ch := V.C[1]; (* this would extract the first byte of V.I *) V.R := 8.3; LA := V.L; (* this would store a Real into an Integer *) In Pascal, copying a real to an integer converts it to the truncated value. This method would translate the binary value of the floating- point number into whatever it is as a long integer (32 bit), which will not be the same and may be incompatible with the long integer value on some systems. These examples could be used to create strange conversions, although, in some cases, there may be legitimate uses for these types of constructs, such as for determining locations of particular pieces of data. In the following example a pointer and a longint are both presumed to be 32 bit: type PA = ^Arec; Arec = record case RT : LongInt of 1: (P : PA ); 2: (L : LongInt); end; var PP : PA; K : LongInt; New(PP); PP^.P := PP; WriteLn('Variable PP is located at address ', Hex(PP^.L)); Where \\"new\\" is the standard routine in Pascal for allocating memory for a pointer, and \\"hex\\" is presumably a routine to print the hexadecimal string describing the value of an integer. This would allow the display of the address of a pointer, something which is not normally permitted. (Pointers cannot be read or written, only assigned.) Assigning a value to an integer variant of a pointer would allow examining or writing to any location in system memory: PP^.L := 0; PP := PP^.P; (* PP now points to address 0 *) K := PP^.L; (* K contains the value of word 0 *) WriteLn('Word 0 of this machine contains ', K); This construct may cause a program check or protection violation if address 0 is protected against reading on the machine the program is running upon or the operating system it is running under. The reinterpret cast technique from C/C++ also works in Pascal. This can be useful, when eg. reading dwords from a byte stream, and we want to treat them as float. Here is a working example, where we reinterpret-cast a dword to a float: type pReal = ^Real; var DW : DWord; F : Real; F := pReal(@DW)^; C# In C# (and other .NET languages), type punning is a little harder to achieve because of the type system, but can be done nonetheless, using pointers or struct unions. Pointers C# only allows pointers to so-called native types, i.e. any primitive type (except \`string\`), enum, array or struct that is composed only of other native types. Note that pointers are only allowed in code blocks marked 'unsafe'. float pi = 3.14159; uint piAsRawData = *(uint*)œÄ Struct unions Struct unions are allowed without any notion of 'unsafe' code, but they do require the definition of a new type. [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)] struct FloatAndUIntUnion { [FieldOffset(0)] public float DataAsFloat; [FieldOffset(0)] public uint DataAsUInt; } // ... FloatAndUIntUnion union; union.DataAsFloat = 3.14159; uint piAsRawData = union.DataAsUInt; Raw CIL code Raw CIL can be used instead of C#, because it doesn't have most of the type limitations. This allows one to, for example, combine two enum values of a generic type: TEnum a = ...; TEnum b = ...; TEnum combined = a b; // illegal This can be circumvented by the following CIL code: .method public static hidebysig !!TEnum CombineEnums( !!TEnum a, !!TEnum b ) cil managed { .maxstack 2 ldarg.0 ldarg.1 or // this will not cause an overflow, because a and b have the same type, and therefore the same size. ret } The \`cpblk\` CIL opcode allows for some other tricks, such as converting a struct to a byte array: .method public static hidebysig uint8[] ToByteArray( !!T& v // 'ref T' in C# ) cil managed { .locals init ( [0] uint8[] ) .maxstack 3 // create a new byte array with length sizeof(T) and store it in local 0 sizeof !!T newarr uint8 dup // keep a copy on the stack for later (1) stloc.0 ldc.i4.0 ldelema uint8 // memcpy(local 0, &v;, sizeof(T)); // ldarg.0 // this is the *address* of 'v', because its type is '!!T&' sizeof !!T cpblk ldloc.0 ret } References External links *Section of the GCC manual on \`-fstrict-aliasing\`, which defeats some type punning *Defect Report 257 to the C99 standard, incidentally defining \\"type punning\\" in terms of \`union\`, and discussing the issues surrounding the implementation-defined behavior of the last example above *Defect Report 283 on the use of unions for type punning Category:Programming constructs Category:Articles with example C code Category:Articles with example Pascal code ","title":"Type punning"},{"id":"8077303","text":"Tot Nut van het Algemeen (trans. 'For the good of all'), commonly known as Tot Nut, was a Dutch-medium school in Cape Town from 1804 to 1870. Description The school catered for all nationalities and played an important role in educating the Dutch-speaking children of the Cape Colony. Its curriculum included modern and ancient languages, literature, mathematics drawing and vocal music. The school also maintained a preparatory section for infants. Staff were drawn from scholars, divines of different denominations and eminent professionals. The precise location of the school has been a matter of some uncertainty. A recent study, however, has identified its original location as being in Strand Street, on the site of the present Cape Sun Hotel. In 1833 the school moved to a new building in Queen Victoria Street, a site which is today occupied by the annexe to the Cape High Court. Schr√∂der's memento states quite categorically that it was in New Street.

He commanded the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade during the Allied invasion of Sicily. Promoted to major-general, he led the 1st Canadian Infantry Division through several battles in the Italian campaign. This included fierce house-to-house fighting in the Battle of Ortona and the advance north to the Hitler Line. In 1944, he took over command of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division and fought in the Battle of the Hochwald. During the latter stages of this battle he notably ordered his division to raze the German town of Friesoythe. His division subsequently destroyed around 85-90% of the town and used the rubble to make good the cratered local roads. After the war, Vokes commanded the Canadian Army Occupation Force in Europe, before returning to Canada to undertake further command assignments. He retired in 1959 and died in 1985 at the age of 80. Family Born in the town of Armagh, Ireland, on 13 April 1904, Vokes was the son of a British officer, Major Frederick Patrick Vokes, and Elizabeth Vokes. They came to Canada in 1910 and Vokes' father served as the engineering officer at the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC). The family lived in the Married Quarters at Ridout Row, RMC. Christopher Vokes' brother, Lieutenant- Colonel Frederick Vokes, took a leading part in the assault on Dieppe in August 1942. In early 1944 he was sent to Italy as commanding officer of the 9th Armoured Regiment (The British Columbia Dragoons). On 31August 1944 he was seriously wounded in action and died in a field hospital on 4September. Early military service Left to right: Vokes, Harry Crerar, Bernard Montgomery, Brian Horrocks, Guy Simonds, Daniel Spry, and Bruce Matthews From 1921 to 1925 Vokes attended the Royal Military College of Canada and was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Engineers. He then attended McGill University from 1926 to 1927 where he received a Bachelor of Science degree and was a member of the Kappa Alpha Society. From 1934 to 1935 he attended Staff College, Camberley in England. In Depression-era Canada many military bases were improved by civilians working in relief camps under supervision of professional military officers, including Camp Dundurn. The original engineer drawings for the concrete rifle range butts were signed by Chris Vokes, in that capacity. Barrack blocks in Dundurn resemble similar buildings constructed at Camp Valcartier in the same time frame. World War II Starting in 1939, Vokes rapidly rose through the ranks of the Canadian General Staff. With the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, he served as Adjutant General, Assistant Quartermaster General, General Staff Officer, grade 1, and as Officer Commanding Princess Patricia‚Äôs Canadian Light Infantry. He proved to be an outstanding operational officer and on 24June 1942 was promoted to Brigadier, in charge of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, which he commanded during the Allied invasion of Sicily. One historian lauded his performance: In 1943 he became the commander of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division and was promoted to the rank of major-general. He was the commander of the division during the Battle of Ortona, after which he was criticized for unimaginative tactics and frontal assaults.Atkinson, The Day of Battle, Abacus, 2013, , p. 302. Montgomery ordered the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to attack along the coast towards Ortona early in December. During an attack on a ravine southwest of Ortona, Vokes continued to send battalion after battalion to attack the mine-fortified German defense for nine days. For this he became known as the \\"Butcher\\" among his men. An impatient Montgomery sent messages wondering why the attack took so long. At the same time, the Canadians became aware of the fact that they were fighting not only Panzer-Grenadiers, but also the 1st Parachute Division, whom they recognized by their characteristic helmets. On the 21 December the Canadians broke through, and German forces destroyed the old town: the Fallschirmj√§gers continued to hold the town ruins for over a week, deploying mines and booby-traps. After the battle Vokes broke out in tears due to his division's losses ‚Äì 2,300 casualties, among them 500 dead, as well as many cases of war neuroses. On 1December 1944, he took over command of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division and fought in the Battle of the Hochwald. Destruction of Friesoythe In April 1945, the town of Friesoythe was attacked by the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division, under General Vokes. Most of the town's 4,000 people moved to the surrounding countryside on about 11‚Äì12 April 1945.The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11 April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11 April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11 April through 12 April 1945. It was clearly a German and not a Canadian initiative. Ferdinand Cloppenburg, Die Stadt Friesoythe im zwanzigsten Jahrhundert, 173. The town was defended by some 200 paratroopers of Battalion Raabe of the 7th German Parachute Division.War Diary, General Staff, 4th Canadian Armoured Division, 1 April 1945-30 April 1945. Appendix 38; dated 14 April 1945. National Archives of Canada, Ottawa, ON, RG 24, vol. no. 13794. Intelligence report signed: E. Sirluck, Capt. These paratroopers repelled the first attack by the Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) on 13 April. The Lake Superior Regiment suffered two dead and nineteen wounded. German casualties are not known. Vokes ordered the resumption of the attack the next day by The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's) commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Frederick E. Wigle. The attack went well, with the Argylls securing the town by 10:30 hours. However, at 08:30 a small number of German soldiers caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise; resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers.Mark Zuehlke, On To Victory: The Canadian Liberation Of The Netherlands, p. 308War Diary, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, 14 April 1945, pp. 10‚Äì11. Ottawa, ON, Canada. National Archives of Canada, RG 24, v. 15,005. The same entry for 14 April 1945, is also reprinted in Robert L. Fraser's Black Yesterdays; the Argylls‚Äôs War, p. 431. Vokes determined on an immediate reprisal. \\"A first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\\".All the published accounts relate that Col. Wigle was shot in the back. However, Dr. Doug Bryce, the Medical Officer of the Argylls, said that he was shot in the head. Dr. Bryce thought very highly of Wigle (\\"the most wonderful man I have ever met\\") so his version has to be given credence on various grounds. Interview with Dr. Bryce, 11 May 1998. Vokes then announced his draconian decision. \\"I summoned my GSO1 . . 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first.Chris Vokes, Vokes: My Story, pp. 194‚Äì195. A substantially identical account of Vokes and his role in the destruction of Friesoythe is found in Tony Foster‚Äôs Meeting of Generals, 437. Units and soldiers of the Argylls had spontaneously begun the arson of Friesoythe to revenge the death of their colonel,Robert L. Fraser, Black Yesterdays; the Argylls‚Äô War. See the section entitled \\"The Burning of Friesoythe?\\" on pp. 435‚Äì437. but after Vokes issued his direct order, the town was systematically set on fire with flamethrowers mounted on Wasp Carriers. The rubble was used to reinforce district roads for the division's tanks.Tony Foster, Meeting of Generals, iUniverse, 2000, , p. 437. According to German estimates, 85% to 90% of the town was destroyed, making it one of the most devastated towns in Germany at the time.Ferdinand Cloppenburg, Die Stadt Friesoythe im zwanzigsten Jahrhundert, pp. 165, 189; Brockhaus. Die Enzyklop√§die. Leipzig: Brockhaus, 1996. 20. Aufl. V. 7, p. 730. Vokes said that he had \\"no feeling of remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe.\\" Later career From June 1945 to May 1946 Vokes was the General Officer Commanding the Canadian Army Occupation Force in Europe. Returning to Canada, he commanded the Canadian Army's Central Command and then Western Command. He retired to Oakville, Ontario in 1959 and in 1985 published his memoirs, My Story. He died of cancer on 27 March 1985, aged 80. References   'Chris Vokes, My Story' Major General Chris Vokes, CB, CBE, DSO, CD with John P.Maclean.

After a career playing college and CFL football, he was the colour commentator for the CFL's BC Lions and the NHL's Vancouver Canucks for many years. After 45 years in broadcasting and covering the Canucks for 27 seasons, he did his last game on October 9, 2010 for the 2010-11 season opener. The radio station he worked for, Team 1040, fired him a few months earlier in July.http://www.puckwatch.com/2010/10/canucks-larscheid- fired-from-team-1040.html Early life and sports career Larscheid was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and raised in California, was a running back for Utah State University, where he was an All-American in 1960. In that year he led the nation with a rushing average of 8.4 yards.Tom Larsheid biography at bcradiohistory.com Highlights of his playing days at Utah State include a 76-yard pass reception against Hawaii in 1959,Aggies Take On Warriors Saturday a 102-yard kickoff return against BYU in 1960, and an 85-yard punt return versus Utah in 1961. Larscheid was selected in the 18th round (251st overall) of the 1962 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles,Utah State Drafted Players/Alumni but ended up signing with the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League, where he played only two seasons before being forced to retire due to knee injuries.1962 CFL Statistics1963 CFL Statistics Broadcasting career After his retirement from football, he became the colour commentator for the BC Lions on CKNW beginning in 1965, working alongside play-by-play commentator Jim Cox. In 1977, he added hockey broadcasting to his duties, joining Jim Robson in the booth for Vancouver Canucks radio broadcasts. When the Lions radio rights moved to CFUN in 1983, Larscheid went with them and left the Canucks broadcasts. In 1984, Cox retired and J. P. McConnell became the new \\"voice of the Lions\\". In 1988, the Lions moved back to CKNW and Larscheid resumed his work with the Canucks. Larscheid's duties included television as well, when the Canucks simulcasted their radio broadcasts on BCTV or CHEK-TV. From 1987 to 1990, Larscheid did television work for football as well, working on the CFL-produced Canadian Football Network, where he worked as a colour commentator on the network's secondary broadcast team and worked four Grey Cups as a sideline reporter and field-level analyst. In 1994, Jim Robson retired from radio and Larscheid's new hockey partner became Jim Hughson. In 1999, Hughson moved back to television full-time and Larscheid was paired with John Shorthouse. All through this time, he continued to juggle both football and hockey. However, this meant frequent scheduling conflicts and in 2000 he was pulled off Lions broadcasts in order to work full-time on Canucks games. In 2006, Larscheid and Shorthouse moved to radio station CKST (\\"The Team 1040\\"), when that station won the Canucks broadcasting rights from CKNW. In addition to acting as a colour commentator, Larscheid regularly interviewed guests between periods in the broadcast booth. In early March 2007, Larscheid hinted that he might retire from his colour commentary duties at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 hockey season, his 24th with the Canucks.Irreplaceable Larscheid mulls retirement - Ed Willes.

The Province, Canada.com May 15, 2007 Tom also made daily appearances on the \\"Canucks Lunch with Blake Price and Dave Tomlinson\\" radio show. On July 28, 2010, Larscheid announced that he would be retiring at the start of the 2010‚Äì11 season. His final radio call was the Vancouver Canucks season opener against the Los Angeles Kings on October 9. He spent 27 seasons as the colour commentator for the Vancouver Canucks and was replaced by Dave Tomlinson. On-air personality Larscheid was known for his enthusiasm, frequently laughing and giggling during broadcasts. He didn't hide his support for the Canucks or Lions and openly cheered for them during broadcasts. He could be very quick to criticize players, coaches and officials, including players of the home teams whom he didn't think gave a maximum effort. His on-air bluntness sometimes angered players. He was said to have occasional conflicts with play-by-play commentators Jim Robson and J. Paul McConnell, who were more conservative. There were couple of incidents where he has uttered expletives on the air, for which he later apologized. One was during Game 1 of the 1994 Western Conference Final, when Toronto defenceman Jamie Macoun speared Vancouver's Murray Craven, causing an angered Larscheid to exclaim, \\"That's just bullshit!\\" Another was during the famous incident in 2000 when Boston defenceman Marty McSorley two-handed Vancouver's Donald Brashear over the head, which prompted Larscheid to react in a similar way.

He was a civil engineer by training. Harland himself was the first full-time planner employed by an American city, and he remained a planner with St. Louis, Missouri for 37 years. Early life Bartholomew was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts on September 14, 1889 but moved to New York City when he was 15 and attended Erasmus High School in Brooklyn. He completed two years of a Civil Engineering degree at Rutgers, but due to lack of funds, was unable to continue his studies. He received an honorary degree in Civil Engineering from Rutgers University in 1921. In 1912 he landed a position with E.P. Goodrich, a civil engineering firm that happened to be a strong advocate for the efficient planning of cities. His work with Goodrich consisted principally of conducting traffic counts on bridges, a task that Bartholomew found dreary but that prepared him for a life of planning around infrastructure and automobility. Career In 1914, the Newark, New Jersey plan commission retained Bartholomew as the first full-time, public-sector city planner in America. In 1915, prominent civic reform advocate Luther Ely Smith, on the advice of the architect Henry Wright, recruited Bartholomew to St. Louis to serve as the city's first planner. He served in that capacity until 1950. In 1917 Bartholomew was a founding member of the American City Planning Institute and headed one of the largest planning consulting firms in the United States. In 1919, he established Harland Bartholomew and Associates and served as its chairman until his retirement in 1962. From 1918 to 1956 Bartholomew taught civic design at the University of Illinois and made substantial contributions to the scholarly and practice literature in city planning. In 1932 he completed his landmark study Urban Land Uses, published by Harvard University Press in the City Planning series edited by Theodora and Charles Hubbard. Bartholomew also published dozens of studies and articles in venues including the City Planning Conference Proceedings, American City, The \\"Annals of the American Academy of Social and Political Science\\", American Civic Annual, City Planning, the \\"Journal of Land and Public Utility Economics\\", and the National Conference on City Planning Bulletin. His writing covered a wide range of practices. He wrote on topics such as the theory and practice of zoning, street widening, cost distribution, placement of railroads, easements, federal buildings in cities, growth controls, economic disintegration, subdivision layout, slum clearance, metropolitan and regional planning, and the role of neighborhoods in the plan process. Bartholomew's career received notice by the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, particularly for his work on the Washington Metro, as chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, and as a leading advocate of society first planning for freeway building. He was appointed to Federal planning committees by three US Presidents--Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. However, many of Bartholomew's views are discredited today. For example, he pioneered urban renewal decades ahead of its time through the use of eminent domain in 1938 to clear the St. Louis Waterfront for the Gateway Arch National Park, which was then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial. He advanced the concept of identifying obsolete neighborhoods through cost accounting (amount of taxes garnered versus city services expended), and was a major advocate for functional, single-use zoning and for automobile-oriented planning. Racial segregation In St. Louis, Bartholomew used planning to maintain racial segregation in cooperation with local realtor associations. In several other cities, Bartholomew's planning was found to be in line with racial, social, and economic segregation. Bartholomew also drew upon racially inequitable metaphors in the 1947 St. Louis city plan to spur residents to accept the necessity of his planning recommendations. His exclusionary approach, if adopted, meant only whites would see the promising future he envisioned. In St. Louis, Bartholomew said an important goal was to prevent movement \\"by colored people\\" into \\"finer residential districts.\\" He estimated where Blacks were likely to live, and created restrictions to keep Blacks out of white areas.

Cruxes are studied in palaeography, textual criticism, bibliography, and literary scholarship. A crux is more serious or extensive than a simple slip of the pen or typographical error. The word comes from Latin crux, Latin for \\"cross\\", used metaphorically as a difficulty that torments one.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. 3a Cruxes occur in a wide range of pre-modern (ancient, medieval, and Renaissance) texts, printed and manuscript. Shakespearean examples Though widely exposed to readers and scholars, the texts of William Shakespeare's plays yield some of the most famous literary cruxes. Some have been resolved fairly well. In Henry V, II.iii.16-7, the First Folio text has the Hostess describe Falstaff on his death-bed like this: Lewis Theobald's editorial correction, \\"and 'a [he] babbl'd of green fields\\", has won almost universal acceptance from subsequent editors,Blakemore Evans, Riverside Shakespeare, pp. 945, 973. although an alternative reading, \\"... as sharp as a pen on a table of green fields\\", alluding to gaming tables and accountants' tables, has been proposed. Similarly, the \\"dram of eale\\" In Hamlet I, iv, 36 can be sensibly interpreted as \\"dram of ev'l [evil]\\",Blakemore Evans, pp. 1148, 1188. but has also been interpreted as \\"dram of ale\\". Other Shakespearean cruxes have not been so successfully resolved. In All's Well That Ends Well, IV.ii, 38-9, Diana observes to Bertram, Editors have reached no consensus on exactly what \\"ropes in such a scarre\\" can mean, or how it should be amended: \\"no satisfactory explanation or emendation has been offered.\\"Blakemore Evans, pp. 530, 543. Perhaps the best alternative that has been proposed is \\"may rope 's [us] in such a snare.\\" Another unresolved Shakespearean crux is the \\"runaway's eyes\\" in Romeo and Juliet, III, ii, 6.Blakemore Evans, p. 1077. Sometimes a crux will not require emendation, but simply present a knotty problem of comprehension. In Henry IV, Part 1, IV, i, 98-9, Sir Richard Vernon describes Prince Hal and his comrades as appearing: This is most likely a reference to some obscure assertion about animal behaviour, and has sent researchers poring through dusty volumes in search of an explanation. Typographic conventions In editions of Greek and Roman authors, a crux is marked off by obeli, to indicate that the editor is not confident enough either to follow the manuscript reading or to print a conjecture.

It is located in Wellington's suburb of Wilton.  Overview  Otari Native Botanic Garden and Wilton's Bush Reserve (Otari-Wilton's Bush) is the only public botanic garden in New Zealand dedicated solely to New Zealand native plants. Trunk of 800-year-old rimu This unique plant sanctuary and forest reserve consists of 100 hectares of native forest, and five hectares of plant collections. Some of Wellington's oldest trees are here, including an 800-year-old rimu. Otari‚ÄìWilton's Bush is classified as a Garden of National Significance by the New Zealand Gardens Trust. It is also one of the Founding Gardens of the Trust. Otari-Wilton's Bush is owned and managed by the Wellington City Council. Entry is free, and is open daily between sunrise and sunset. The Te Marae o Tane Information Centre is open 8.00am - 4.00pm daily. Located only 5 km from the city centre, at 160 Wilton Road (between Gloucester and Warwick streets). You can either drive from the city and park at the main public car park is at the Wilton Road entrance, or take the No 14 Wilton bus from Lambton Quay to Otari-Wilton's Bush. Public parking is also available off Churchill Drive. Wheelchair-friendly paths run from the main carpark to the Information Centre, over the Canopy Walkway, and to Cockayne Lookout. A step- free path runs from the Churchill Drive carpark along the Kaiwharawhara streamside to the Troup Picnic Lawn.  History  Otari-Wilton's Bush was originally covered with podocarp broadleaf forest. The name ‚ÄúOtari‚Äù is MƒÅori for ‚ÄúPlace of Snares‚Äù. The forest was a good place for bird hunting. When the region was colonized by Europeans, trees were removed for timber, and to create farmland. The first part of the reserve to be protected was a 7 hectare area of original forest that was fenced off from stock in 1860 by a far- sighted local farmer, Job Wilton. This became known as Wilton‚Äôs Bush, in 1906 the forest was gazetted as scenic reserve. Many parts of the current Otari- Wilton's Bush reserve have been designated as reserve by the New Zealand government and Wellington City Council. This includes most of the remnants of the mature podocarpaceae forest that once cloaked all of Wellington and the surrounding hills. The forest area holds native trees that are hundreds of years old, like matai Prumnopitys taxifolia and rimu Dacrydium cupressinum, as well as tawa Beilschmiedia tawa, rewarewa Knightia excelsa and kohekohe Dysoxylum spectabile. Ancient Forests The plant collections that now form the native botanic gardens, were the brainchild of eminent botanist Dr Leonard Cockayne, who started developing this collections in 1926.Plant Collections  Native Botanic Gardens  Otari Native Botanic Garden Otari Native Botanic Garden The Otari-Wilton's Bush plant collections contain about 1,200 species, hybrids and cultivars. The collections include plants from New Zealand's mainland and off-shore islands. Almost all the plants have been grown from cuttings or seeds collected from their original habitats. The collection has the following roles: * Conservation: Seedlings of threatened species are raised and either kept in the gardens as a conservation measure, or returned to the wild in plant conservation recovery programmes. * Research: Scientists use the plant collections for studying plant ecology, economic potential, and classification. * Education: Plants are labelled to help visitors learn about their names and characteristics. * Recreation: Otari-Wilton's Bush is a great place for locals and tourists to escape urban life and appreciate New Zealand's unique flora. The plant collections were started in 1926 by eminent New Zealand botanist Dr Leonard Cockayne. He aimed to establish a collection of solely New Zealand native plants, displayed in family groups or as re- created ecosystems representing different areas of New Zealand. The plants are arranged in distinct collections, including an alpine garden, a fernery, hebe and flax cultivars, a large rock garden, grass and sedge species, and a coastal garden.Plant Collections; see also: Collections page on the official website; and: Map of the collections  Conservation  In the Native Botanic Gardens are many New Zealand plants that are threatened in the wild. Some of these are raised and either kept in the gardens as a conservation measure, or returned to the wild in plant conservation recovery programmes. Human settlement has caused many plants to disappear from New Zealand's forests, wetlands and coasts. Major losses are blamed on industries such as agriculture and forestry, and the introduction of animal pests and invasive weeds. Several New Zealand plants are already extinct and over 180 plants are classified as severely threatened.  Forest Reserve and Restoration  There are 100 hectares of forest made up of original and regenerating podocarp broadleaf forest. It includes a stand of original bush, 17 acres set aside by Job Wilton in 1860, and a much larger area of regenerating bush. The original bush has some very large trees such as rimu and rata, which are estimated to be between 400 and 800 years old. Large conifers (podocarps) such as rimu, totara, miro and matai can be viewed from the Canopy Walkway or the Nature Trail. About 150 species of flowering plants, conifers and ferns can be found in the forest. Epiphytes or perching plants sit high in the branches of mature trees. Climbing plants, including the New Zealand passionfruit, supplejack, and rata occur throughout the forest. Kohekohe, rewarewa, tawa and mahoe trees dominate the upper slopes and merge with forest remnants of old rimu and matai. In the wetter areas, tall pukatea can be seen with their buttressed roots. On the high south-facing slopes, scrub is dominated by introduced gorse and Darwin‚Äôs barberry with colonising native plants such as mahoe and rangiora. Native birds include tui, kereru, pƒ´wakawaka (fantail), kƒÅkƒÅ, silvereye, k≈çtare (kingfisher), grey warbler and ruru (morepork). Staff and volunteers have been planting thousands of trees since 2001, in an effort to accelerate the process of forest restoration in and around the scenic reserve. Targets are ‚Äì among others ‚Äì to improve the biodiversity and to encourage native birds and insects. Much of the work is done by volunteers associated with the Otari- Wilton's Bush Trust. The regenerating bush started in the gullies and now covers most of the reserve, working its way up to the tops of the hills on the far side of the valley.

It is found in Bohai Gulf of China and off the Korean and Japanese coasts. It is not to be confused with a closely related species, Urechis caupo, which occurs on the western coast of North America and shares common names. The body is about 10‚Äì30 cm long, cylindrical in shape and yellowish-brown in color. On the surface of the body there are many small papillae. Ecology This spoonworm is a detritivore, feeding on detritus, and like other species of Urechis, lives and burrows in sand and mud. It creates a U-shaped burrow in the soft sediment of the seabed. A ring of glands at the front of the proboscis secrete mucus which sticks to the burrow wall. The worm continues to exude mucus as it moves backwards in the burrow thus creating a mucus net. The worm draws water through its burrow by peristaltic contractions of its body and food particles adhere to the net. When enough food is gathered, the worm moves forward in its burrow and swallows the net and entangled food. This process is repeated, and in an area with plenty of detritus, may be completed in only a few minutes. Uses In Korea, they are eaten as food, often raw with salt and sesame oil or gochujang. They are distributed in Korea, Japan, and the Pacific coast. In Chinese cuisine, the worm is stir-fried with vegetables, or dried and powdered to be used as an umami enhancer. It is also used as fishing bait for fish such as flounder and sea bream.

A stylistically diverse album, Boz Scaggs incorporates several genres, including Americana, blue-eyed soul, country, and rhythm and blues. The lyrics are about typical themes found in blues songs, such as love, regret, guilt, and loss. Scaggs recorded the album at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio with producer Jann Wenner, the co-founder of Rolling Stone magazine. The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section heavily contributed to the album, which included a young Duane Allman, before his rise to fame with the Allman Brothers Band. Boz Scaggs was mostly ignored by listeners and critics upon release, and only sold around 20,000 copies within its first few years. The critics that did review the album enjoyed it, and commended the musicianship between Scaggs and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. Boz Scaggs continues to receive praise in retrospective reviews, with some critics calling it an underrated album from the 1960s. In 2012, Boz Scaggs was ranked at number 496 on Rolling Stone list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Background and recording In 1967, Boz Scaggs joined the Steve Miller Band, a San Francisco-based rock group. He played guitar on the band's first two albums‚ÄîChildren of the Future and Sailor (both 1968)‚Äîbefore leaving the same year to pursue a solo career. At the time, Scaggs lived in Potrero Hill, and was next-door neighbors with Jann Wenner, the co-founder of Rolling Stone magazine. The two became good friends; Wenner provided feedback on material Scaggs had written, and encouraged him to make some demo tapes. Wenner was looking for more funding for the magazine, and talked with music executives along the East Coast of the United States. In one of the meetings, he talked with Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records, and gave Wexler a demo tape Scaggs had made. Wexler was impressed by the music, and asked Wenner to produce an album with Scaggs under the Atlantic label. After some initial discussions with Scaggs, Wenner suggested he record the album at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Sheffield, Alabama, based on the style of music he had been making. Scaggs wanted to watch some of the recording sessions at Muscle Shoals anonymously, so Wenner gave him a Rolling Stone press badge to visit the studio and interact with the studio musicians. During this visit, Scaggs met several musicians that would appear on Boz Scaggs, including Duane Allman, Roger Hawkins, and David Hood. Scaggs and Wenner wanted Allman to be one of the prominent guitarists on the album, but after calling Muscle Shoals they found out Allman had moved to Macon, Georgia, and was in the process of forming what would become the Allman Brothers Band. Wenner was able to convince Allman to come back for one week after mentioning Atlantic Records involvement. Scaggs said that having Allman come back was a catalyst for the album, as the musicians in the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section had great respect for him. In addition to Allman, Boz Scaggs featured many backing musicians, including: Hawkins, Hood, Barry Beckett, Eddie Hinton, and Jimmy Johnson. When asked about the recording sessions with Wenner, Scaggs said: \\"He was as good of a producer as anyone could want, he was very encouraging.\\" Composition Music and lyrics Boz Scaggs an amalgamation of several genres, including Americana, blue-eyed soul, country, and rhythm and blues; tracks on the album often switch between these genres. Wenner wanted Boz Scaggs to serve as a musical showcase for both Scaggs and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. \\"I knew the Muscle Shoals guys had never been used to stretch out ... I thought we should make a rock & roll record that showcased them as much as Boz.\\" According to Wenner, Boz Scaggs was inspired by the music of Clarence Carter and the Bob Dylan album Nashville Skyline. Lyrically, Scaggs sings about typical themes found in blues songs, such as love, regret, guilt, and loss. Songs Side one of the album opens with two traditional blue-eyed soul songs titled \\"I'm Easy\\" and \\"I'll Be Long Gone\\". Variety likened \\"I'm Easy\\" to the sound of Aretha Franklin, and \\"I'll Be Long Gone\\" to Dionne Warwick. Ed Leimbacher of Rolling Stone expanded upon the Warwick connection, describing the track's gentle interplay on the organ as having a heavy influence of gospel music. \\"Another Day (Another Letter)\\" is a rock ballad with '50s progression, while \\"Now You're Gone\\" is a honky-tonk country track with a slide guitar and fiddle. The contemporary country track \\"Finding Her\\" features a bridge section with more slide guitar and a piano instrumental, which Leimbacher compared Moonlight Sonata. Side one ends with the folk inspired track \\"Look What I've Got\\". Side two opens with a cover of the Jimmy Rodgers song \\"Waiting for a Train\\", in which an accentuated piano is accompanied by Scagg's yodels. The penultimate track is \\"Loan Me a Dime\\", a cover of the Fenton Robinson song \\"Somebody Loan Me a Dime\\". The 1969 release lists Scaggs as the songwriter, but later reissues credit the song to Robinson. It is a twelve and a half minutes and is widely considered by critics to be the centerpiece of the album. About halfway through the track, Scaggs stops singing, and Allman begins an extended guitar solo. The original version of \\"Loan Me a Dime\\" was a forty-minute jam session, which was shorted to the twelve minute version on Boz Scaggs. The lyrics on the final track, \\"Sweet Release\\" contrast the pessimistic themes found on the rest of the album. Scaggs sings about the necessity in the redemptive power of music. Reception Boz Scaggs was released on August 19, 1969, as Scagg's debut album with Atlantic Records. It was mostly ignored by listeners and critics, and only sold around 20,000 copies within its first few years of release. The critics that did review the album enjoyed it, and commended the musicianship between Scaggs and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. Billboard highlighted the tracks \\"I'll Be Long Gone\\", \\"Finding Her\\", and \\"Waiting for a Train\\", and wrote how the album would boost Scaggs into the public eye. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice praised Allman's role, and called Boz Scaggs \\"a nice tribute to American music\\". Rolling Stone critic Ed Leimbacher credited Scaggs for exploring rock, gospel, soul, and the blues \\"effortlessly\\" and with \\"panache\\". Critics continue to praise Boz Scaggs in retrospective reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as an early showcase for Scaggs' musical skills, and ultimately wrote: \\"[Boz Scaggs] is an enduring blue-eyed soul masterpiece\\". The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album four and a half out of five stars, and described \\"Loan Me a Dime\\" as a highlight in the careers of both Scaggs and Allman. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked Boz Scaggs at number 496 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The magazine called it an \\"underrated gem\\", a sentiment which was shared by the magazine No Depression. Since its initial release, Boz Scaggs has been reissued several times. A 1976 reissue peaked at number 176 on the Billboard 200 in the United States. A 1990 reissue featured a different audio mix, and was at the time the only CD version of the album. The original mix was re- issued in 2013, on the Super Audio CD format by Audio Fidelity. This version came with a 24-karat gold disc.

This mode can also be used for security purposes network services are not run, eliminating the possibility of outside interference. On some systems a lost superuser password can be changed by switching to single-user mode, but not asking for the password in such circumstances is viewed as a security vulnerability. Unix family Unix-like operating systems provide single-user mode functionality either through the System V-style runlevels, BSD-style boot-loader options, or other boot-time options. The run-level is usually changed using the \`init\` command, runlevel 1 or S will boot into single-user mode. Boot-loader options can be changed during startup before the execution of the kernel. In FreeBSD and DragonFly BSD it can be changed before rebooting the system with the command \`nextboot -o \\"-s\\" -k kernel\`, and its bootloader offers the option on bootup to start in single-user mode. In Solaris the command \`reboot -- -s\` will cause a reboot into single-user mode. macOS users can accomplish this by holding down after powering the system. The user may be required to enter a password set in the firmware.

These may be long or short. Porson's Law states that, if the third anceps (i.e. the bolded x above) is long and followed by a word break, then it must be a monosyllable. A simpler summary of the Law is provided in W. W. Goodwin's Greek Grammar: :\\"When the tragic trimeter ends in a word forming a cretic (‚Äì u ‚Äì), this is regularly preceded by a short syllable or by a monosyllable.\\"Goodwin, W. W. Greek Grammar, Macmillan (1895), p.358 ¬ß1660 M. L. West states it slightly differently, to take account of a rare situation not accounted for by Porson, where the word- break is followed rather than preceded by a monosyllable (e.g. Euripides, Heraclidae 529): :\\"When the anceps of the third metron is occupied by a long syllable, this syllable and the one following belong to the same word, unless one of them is a monosyllable.\\"West, M. L. Introduction to Greek Metre: Oxford: Clarendon Press (1987), p.25 These formulations avoid the difficulty that the reference to the ninth syllable would be inaccurate if there is resolution earlier in the line. An example There are, as West observes, very few breaches of Porson's Law in extant Greek tragedy. When the manuscript tradition, therefore, transmits a line that breaches Porson's Law, this is taken as a reason for suspecting that it may be corrupt. For example, the first line of Euripides' Ion, as transmitted in the mediaeval manuscript Laurentianus 32.2 (known as \\"L\\"), the main source for the play, reads: :u ‚Äì u ‚Äì / u ‚Äì u‚Äì / ‚Äì ‚Äìu‚Äì : : :Atlas, who with his back of bronze [rubs up] against heaven... (trans. Lee) As Porson himself had already observed in his note on line 347 in his first (1797) edition of Euripides' Hecuba,Clarke, M.L., (1937) Richard Porson: A Biographical Essay, page 70. this line is irregular, since -œÑŒøŒπœÇ in ŒΩœéœÑŒøŒπœÇ is long, occurs at the third anceps, and is followed by word break; it therefore breaks the law which Porson later formulated, and it is unlikely that Euripides wrote it as it stands. That the manuscript tradition is incorrect happens to be confirmed by a quotation of this line in a fragmentary papyrus of Philodemus. Philodemus' exact original text is uncertain, but it is reconstructed by Denys Page to read ·ΩÅ œáŒ±ŒªŒ∫Œ≠ŒøŒπœÉŒπ Œø·ΩêœÅŒ±ŒΩ·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒΩœéœÑŒøŒπœÇ ·ºåœÑŒªŒ±œÇ (meaning the same as L's version), which does not break Porson's Law, and therefore may be the correct text. However, other scholars have suggested various other possibilities as to what Euripides may originally have written.Lee, K. H. Euripides, Ion: Aris and Phillips (1997), ad loc. Other similar laws Several other similar laws or tendencies, such as (a) Knox's Iamb Bridge (stating that an iambic word, i.e. a word of shape u ‚Äì, tends to be avoided in positions 9 and 10 in the iambic trimeter), (b) Wilamowitz's Bridge (stating that a spondaic word, of shape ‚Äì ‚Äì, is avoided in the same position), (c) Knox's Trochee Bridge (stating that a trochaic word, of shape ‚Äì u, tends to be avoided in positions 8 and 9), and (d) the law of tetrasyllables (stating that words of the rhythm ‚Äì ‚Äì u x are avoided at the end or beginning of a line), have been discovered since Porson's time. These laws apply to different styles or periods of iambic-trimeter writing (neither of the first two bridges mentioned above apply in tragedy, for example). Details of these and other constraints on the trimeter are given in a 1981 article by A.M. Devine and L.D. Stephens.A.M. Devine, Lawrence D. Stephens (1981) \\"Bridges in the Iambographers\\". Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 22. Possible explanations Similar laws which have been discovered in the dactylic hexameter are that if a word ends the fifth or fourth foot it is almost never, or only rarely, a spondee (‚Äì ‚Äì). The philologist W. Sidney Allen suggested an explanation for all these laws in that it is possible that the last long syllable in any Greek word had a slight stress; if so, then to put a stress on the first element of the last iambic metron, or the second element of the 4th or fifth dactylic foot in a hexameter, would create an undesirable conflict of ictus and accent near the end of the line.W. Sidney Allen (1974) Vox Graeca (2nd edition), pp. 120-123. An alternative hypothesis, supported by Devine and Stephens in their book The Prosody of Greek Speech,A.M. Devine, Laurence D. Stephens, (1994) The Prosody of Greek Speech (Oxford University Press), pp. 119-20.Fortson, B.W. (1995) \\"Review of Devine and Stephens (1994). Bryn Mawr Classical Review. is that in certain contexts some long syllables in Greek had a longer duration than others, and this may have made them unsuitable for the anceps position of the third metron of a trimeter. The iambic senarius In the Latin equivalent of the iambic trimeter, the iambic senarius, Porson's law is not observed, and lines like the following which break Porson's law are perfectly possible: :nam meus pater intus nunc est eccum IuppiterPlautus Amphitruo 120. :\\"for behold, my father Jupiter is now inside\\" Lines like the following, where there is an apparent conflict between ictus and word-stress in the last metron, are also common: :Amphitruo, natus Argis ex Argo patrePlautus Amphitruo 98. :\\"Amphitruo, born in Argos from an Argive father\\" Citations Category:Poetic rhythm ","title":"Porson's Law"},{"id":"8077649","text":"Casualty@Holby City (styled as CASUAL+Y @ HOLBY CI+Y) is a series of special crossover episodes of BBC medical dramas Casualty and Holby City. While Casualty was launched on 6 September 1986, and its spin-off Holby City was first aired on 12 January 1999, the first full crossover episode between the two programmes was not broadcast until 26 December 2004. As of 27 December 2005, four crossover specials have been aired, comprising nine episodes total. Although further crossovers of storylines and characters have since occurred, they have not been broadcast under the Casualty@Holby City title. Production The suggestion to produce the first Casualty and Holby City crossover originated from a member of the BBC comedy department. The station's Controller of Drama approved of the idea and had the crossover commissioned, spearheaded by Casualty executive producer Mervyn Watson, and Holby City Tony McHale. The writer and producer for the first, two-part crossover were selected from the Holby City crew. Logistical difficulties arose from the fact the two series are usually produced 120 miles apart, with Casualty based in Bristol and Holby City in Elstree. Both series are usually in continuous production 52 weeks a year, so in order to produce the first crossover, work on both shows has to be halted for two weeks to release a number of cast members to appear in the special. Once regular production began again, the availability of cast members set to appear in the crossover was limited, and both series had to rely for the most part on the remaining characters who were not in the special. Filming took six weeks to complete, and occurred for the most part at Casualty emergency department in Bristol. Additional filming took place at the Holby City set in Elstree, as well as the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children, a Barratts office block in Brentford and an ex-MOD tank testing site in Chobham. A theme tune was devised, consisting of both the Casualty and Holby City theme tunes played over one another in sync. Terry Ramsey of the Evening Standard described it as \\"shambolic\\", opining: \\"it sounds like it was produced with The Big Boy's Box of Sound Mixing software by a seven-year-old on Christmas Day while playing his PlayStation with the other hand.\\" Professor Robert Winston hosts the interactive episode \\"Something We Can Do\\". A second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season. In August 2005, the station ran a week-long campaign to raise public awareness of organ donation, aiming to help viewers make an informed decision about whether to sign up to the Organ Donation Register. An interactive episode of Casualty@Holby City was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional organ donation. The episode was part documentary, and a segment presented by Robert Winston both detailed the guidelines for matching organ donors with recipients, and dispelled common myths about organ donation. Viewers were then invited to vote for one of two characters to receive a heart transplant. 98,800 viewers voted, with a 65 percent majority favouring that the organ be received by Lucy, a young cystic fibrosis patient, over Tony, a widow twenty years her senior. Two different endings were filmed, to account for both possible outcomes of the public vote. The alternative ending was made available on the Casualty@Holby City DoNation Interactive website. The third Casualty@Holby City crossover was aired in October 2005, two months after the interactive special. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A&E; demonstration at an inner- city school. The crossover was broadcast in the same week that the BBC launched a new adaptation of Charles Dickens' Bleak House starring Gillian Anderson and Charles Dance, and Phil and Grant Mitchell returned to the station's soap opera EastEnders. BBC1 controller Peter Fincham explained: \\"We have got three very different dramas playing this week that emphasise the breadth and depth of what we have to offer. Changing the scheduling of established favourites and the format for presenting period drama is exactly what I want BBC1 to be doing, challenging our audiences with top quality programming.\\" Based on the success of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another crossover was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Diana Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing. A large proportion of the crossover was filmed in a road tunnel in Caernarfon, Wales. Watson commented: \\"It was the only one that we could hire for two weeks without causing huge traffic jams. The whole shoot was five weeks long. Staging stunts like car accidents is difficult and stressful at the best of times, but doing all that in a tunnel doubled it. The great advantage was that there was no problem with the weather, it was a totally controlled environment with excellent parking facilities for the unit, and a warm welcome from the locals, which is always nice.\\" Characters and cast Main characters Casualty@Holby City focuses on the medical staff at Holby General, with main roles filled by regular Casualty and Holby City cast members. The first crossover, broadcast in December 2004, features Casualty emergency medicine consultant Harry Harper (Simon MacCorkindale), consultant paediatrician Jim Brodie (Maxwell Caulfield), Clinical Nurse Manager Tess Bateman (Suzanne Packer), paramedics Luke Warren (Matthew Wait) and Josh Griffiths (Ian Bleasdale) and receptionist Bex Reynolds (Sarah Manners). Holby City characters who appear are cardiothoracic consultant Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), general surgical consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie), midwife Rosie Sattar (Kim Vithana), obstetrics registrar Mubbs Hussein (Ian Aspinall), staff nurse Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs), and cardiac consultant Alistair Taylor (Dominic Jephcott). The interactive episode again stars MacCorkindale, Bleasdale, Packer and Wait. Additional Casualty characters who appear are paramedic Comfort Jones (Martina Laird), senior staff nurse Abs Denham (James Redmond), Emergency Medical Technician Nina Farr (Rebekah Gibbs) and specialist registrar Maggie Coldwell (Susan Cookson). Holby City critical care consultant Lola Griffin (Sharon D. Clarke) and matron Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White) also star. The four-part October 2005 crossover again stars MacCorkindale, Bleasdale, Packer, Wait, Laird, Redmond, Gibbs, Mealing and Quarshie. It also features Casualty paramedic Paul \\"Woody\\" Joyner (Will Thorp), staff nurse Kelsey Phillips (Janine Mellor), senior staff nurse Bruno Jenkins (Mark Bonnar), neurology associate specialist Selena Donovan (Elizabeth Carling) and SHO Guppy Sandhu (Elyes Gabel). Holby City characters who appear are registrar Diane Lloyd (Patricia Potter), matron Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), consultant obstetrician Owen Davis (Mark Moraghan), medical student Matt Parker (Adam Best), staff nurse Tricia Williams (Sharon Maughan) and cardiothoracic consultant Ed Loftwood (Graeme Garden). \\"Deny Thy Father\\", the two-part December 2005 crossover, stars Casualty MacCorkindale, Bleasdale, Packer, Wait, Cookson, Thorp, Mellor and Carling, as well as Clinical Nurse Specialist Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) and receptionist Sam Bateman (Luke Bailey). Mealing, Quarshie, Jacobs and Clarke of the Holby City cast also star, along with general surgical registrar Nick Jordan (Michael French) and midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). Thorp's character was killed off during the second episode. The actor praised the crossover, commenting: \\"Filming it was like filming a feature film. Massive stunts and good storylines. There was a really good buzz on set all the time... As an actor, you couldn't wish for a better exit. It was absolutely brilliant.\\" Guest stars Freema Agyeman guest-stars in the first Casualty@Holby City crossover. The crossover episodes include numerous guest stars, typically as patients and their friends and relatives. In the December 2004 crossover, John McArdle and Kerry Peers play husband and wife Frank and Sarah Morgan, whose daughter Danielle (Zoe Morgan) receives a heart transplant. Ren√© Zagger appears as Bob Smith, a tanker driver who crashes into the hospital, and Nicola Stapleton plays his wife Shirley. Freema Agyeman plays Kate Hindley, a patient trapped under rubble following the collision, and Keith-Lee Castle appears as isolation ward doctor Phil. Annette Badland and Hywel Bennett guest-star in \\"Something We Can Do\\" as Wendy and David Winters, whose son Matt (David Alderman) dies following a car accident. Emily Hamilton acts as his wife Sarah. Steven Pinder plays Tony Harvey, a potential recipient of Matt's donated heart, and Nina Wadia appears as his girlfriend Jean. Yvonne O'Grady plays Carol Beddows, whose daughter Lucy (Sarah Bedi) is also a potential recipient. The interactive segment of the episode is presented by Robert Winston. In the four-part Halloween crossover, James Gaddas guest-stars as Carl O'Leary, the headmaster of a failing school. James Pearson plays Adrian Lucas, a pupil who puts acid in the water used in apple bobbing. Jason Maza appears as Kris Burrows, whose girlfriend Emma Blakely (Kate Scott) is burned by the acid, and Red Madrell plays Shania Campbell, Emma's best friend who is also burned. Ade Sapara appears as Edgar Muzenda, a poet and political refugee involved in a car accident, and Nikki Amuka-Bird plays his pregnant wife Moji. Louis Mahoney appears as their friend Raymond Opoku. The December 2005 crossover features Iain Fletcher as fire officer Iain Bain, Julia Hills as Woody's mother Caroline Joyner, Fiona Glascott as Tara Doyle, a girl trapped when a tunnel collapses, and Gary Whelan as Tara's father Bernie. Episodes Reception Critical response Casualty@Holby City episodes have received mixed reviews from critics. Terry Ramsey of the Evening Standard selected the first episode as a televisual \\"Pick of the Day\\". The inaugural crossover was named one of the \\"Best TV shows for Christmas & New Year\\" in The Mirror, receiving generally favourable reviews by Mirror writers Jane Simon and Jim Shelley‚Äîdespite the former lambasting the realism of the plot: \\"The building collapses, there's a little girl upstairs about to have a heart transplant, the tanker's leaking fuel and there's a velociraptor loose in radiology. Sorry, I made that last one up.\\"‚Äîand the latter commenting that \\"Casualty@Holby City was deeply weird, like watching Casualty on acid.\\" Similarly, Daniel Davies of The Western Mail also selected the episodes as dramatic highlights of the Christmas season, despite going on to discuss the aptness of the BBC's press release describing the two episodes as \\"thrown together.\\" Other reviews were more openly negative, with Charlie Brooker of The Guardian describing the episodes as \\"two virtually identical and rubbish shitcasts for the price of one.\\" Frances Traynor of the Daily Record commented similarly that: \\"It can be quite difficult to tell these medical drama twins apart. After all, they're both rubbish\\", while the Liverpool Echo Paddy Shennan suggested \\"the blood should instead be flowing in the BBC boardroom\\" for commissioning the crossover. Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent called the crossover \\"the funniest programme on television\\", with a \\"sublimely cloth- eared script\\", describing it as: \\"A masterpiece of sustained comic timing [which] had this casual viewer of the dramas that spawned it scrabbling wildly for an explanatory hypothesis.\\" The interactive episode was deemed \\"a horrible mess\\" by Shelley, while Garry Bushell of The People kept his criticism brief, limiting his review to: \\"Casualty@Holby City? Takings up@pub.\\" Paul Hoggart of The Times was dubious about the episode's purported \\"interactive\\" element, given the limited choices involved. He commented: \\"The twin hospital dramas have never been afraid of didactic storylines, but this example, constructed to illustrate the ethical dilemmas of those involved, is about as didactic as it gets. Let's hope this benevolent propaganda works.\\" The four crossover episodes which broadcast in November 2005 were generally well received by the press. The opening episode was a recommended \\"TV Choice\\" of The Daily Telegraph Chris Riley, a \\"Pick of the Day\\" of The Mirror Simon, and a \\"Pick of the Night\\" of the Evening Standard Ramsey. The crossover was also a \\"Drama Choice\\" of Sarah Moolla of The People, who commented that: \\"There's something weirdly thrilling when these two medical shows collide.\\" The Christmas 2005 episodes were less favourable received, described by David Chater of The Times as: \\"Intentionally or not [...] one of the comic highlights of Christmas.\\" Paul English of the Daily Record deemed the crossover: \\"Two turkeys for the price of one\\", while Terry Ramsey of The Evening Standard wrote that: \\"even by Casualty and Holby City standards, this one is boringly formulaic. A monotoned, badly paced, cornily written, unexciting (despite its most desperate efforts), predictable, high-pitch squeal of a drama. For die-hard fans only.\\" The Daily Post were more positive, stating that the episodes \\"will have Casualty and Holby City fans glued to their TV sets over the festive period.\\" Ratings The December 2004 Casualty@Holby City crossover received strong ratings. The first episode averaged 8.91 million viewers, making it the third most watched terrestrial programme of the day. The second episode was watched by 8.82 million viewers, making it the second highest rated terrestrial programme of the day. The interactive donation episode, \\"Something We Can Do\\", attained 7.32 million viewers, again making it the second most watched terrestrial programme of the day, and also the BBC's second best rated programme of the week, behind only EastEnders. The October 2005 episodes received the lowest ratings of any Casualty@Holby City crossover to date. On its opening night, the show was watched by 5.56 million viewers, in contrast to the ITV soap opera Emmerdale, which were shown in the same timeslot and attained 9.1 million viewers. The remainder of the Halloween crossover received similarly low ratings, with the second episode watched by 5.96 million viewers, the third instalment by 4.57 million viewers, and the concluding episode by 5.64 million viewers. The fourth Casualty@Holby City crossover saw a ratings revival, with the third episode watched by 8 million viewers, making it the third most watched terrestrial programme of the day, and the second episode watched by 8.82 million viewers, becoming the second most watched terrestrial programme of the day. Future Asked about the potential for future crossover episodes, Watson stated in 2005: \\"We can't guarantee any crossovers for next year, but the audience likes them. And as long as the controller of BBC One wants them, then we'll be happy to oblige.\\" In November 2007, Kyle re-iterated that the separate series' 52-week filming schedules make it logistically difficult to produce crossovers, but revealed that the production teams were trying to create more opportunities for the two shows to merge. A new set of crossover episodes written by Casualty lead writer Mark Catley were planned for February 2010. In the event, however, the episodes which saw Casualty Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) operated on by Holby City Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley) after suffering a heart attack were broadcast as regular Casualty and Holby City episodes, rather than under the Casualty@Holby City title. Since then, characters periodically crossover typically for a single episode at a time to fit an ongoing storyline. This has proved popular among fans and is logistically more practical than previous crossover events. In more recent years, characters have attained different positions within the hospital which sees them crossover permanently. Connie Beauchamp began appearing permanently in Casualty in March 2014 following her departure from Holby City in December 2010. Fletch departed Casualty in June 2014 before appearing permanently on Holby City from August the same year. Lee Mead portrayed Lofty on Casualty from March 2014 to March 2016. Following his departure, it was announced Mead would be reprising his role in Holby City from April 2017. Another smaller scale crossover event was broadcast in August 2016, in \\"Too Old for This Shift\\" and \\"Protect and Serve\\" The episodes were co-written by Matthew Barry and Andy Bayliss (Casualty) and Steve Brett and Joe Ainsworth (Holby City). The episodes follow on from the cliffhanger at the end of the thirtieth series, by focusing on the events surrounding the aftermath of an accident involving Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) and her daughter Grace (Emily Carey), including a helicopter crash outside Holby City Hospital's emergency department, during celebrations of Charlie Fairhead's (Derek Thompson) thirtieth year working at the hospital. Another series of crossovers was implemented in late 2017, with a number of characters that swapped over for episodes.http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/holby- city/feature/a835666/holby-city-spoilers-secrets-producer-kate-hall/ References External links * Casualty@Holby City Christmas crossover 2004 at BBC Online * Casualty@Holby City Interactive at BBC Online * Casualty@Holby City Christmas crossover 2005 at BBC Online * Category:Holby Category:BBC television dramas Category:2000s British drama television series Category:2004 British television series debuts Category:2005 British television series endings ","title":"Casualty@Holby City"},{"id":"8077735","text":"Logo of the Holy Spirit Missionary Sisters The Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit, also known as Holy Spirit Missionary Sisters, or simply Holy Spirit Sisters (Latin: Servae Spiritus Sancti, SSpS) is a religious congregation within the Catholic Church.

In 1875 he founded in Steyl, the Netherlands \\"St. Michael the Archangel Mission House\\" to train priests for the missions. From this developed the Society of the Divine Word. Helena Stollenwerk Helena Stollenwerk was born on 28 November 1852. At a very young age she developed an interest in joining the missions and going to China, but was unable to find a convent that sent missionaries abroad. In 1882 she met Arnold Janssen and worked as a kitchen maid at St. Michael Mission House in Steyl. In 1884, she was joined by Hendrina Stenmanns. Janssen perceived a need for female missionaries to complement the work of the male missionaries.On 8 December 1889 Stollenwerk became of postulant of a women's congregation established by Janssen, the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit,\\"Our Roots\\" Holy Spirit Missionary Sisters -USA and on 17 January 1892 assumed the religious name \\"Maria Virgo\\".

Carmel Henry Carfora) (August 27, 1878 ‚Äì January 11, 1958), the son of Ferdinand Carfora and Angeline D'Ambrosio, was baptized Roman Catholic in his native Naples, Italy on August 29, 1878. He entered the Franciscans in 1894 and was ordained deacon by Bishop Giuseppe Ciglano on August 15, 1901 and priest by Bishop Francesco Vento of Aversa on December 21, 1901. He immigrated to America and served in New York. In 1906 he was called to the Diocese of Wheeling to minister to Italian immigrants. Eventually, in 1908, he left the Roman Catholic Church. Carfora assumed leadership of a group of parishioners who broke away from St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church, in Youngstown, Ohio, to found St. Rocco's Independent National Catholic Church on May 17, 1907.Church Life! \\"Closing Doors, PreservingTraditions, Opening Hearts\\" Retrieved July 26, 2019. He later formed mission congregations which ministered to various ethnic immigrant groups whom he perceived as unable to gain adequate pastoral support from the Roman Catholic authorities. In June, 1912 he incorporated his work as the National Catholic Diocese in North America, for a time under the episcopal oversight of Bishop Paolo Miraglia-Gulotti, leader of the Italian National Episcopal Church. Rudolph de Landas Berghes took up residence at St. Dunstan's Abbey, Waukegan, Illinois and raised Abbot William H. F. Brothers to the episcopacy on October 3, 1916. The following day he consecrated Carfora as a bishop of the North American Old Roman Catholic Church. St. Rocco's was disbanded until it was received into the Episcopal Church on June 15, 1918. In 1917 de Landas Berghes and Carfora united their jurisdictions, adopting the name \\"North American Old Roman Catholic Diocese\\" and established its headquarters in Chicago. When de Landas Berghes reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church in 1919, Carfora assumed the leadership of the group, which he renamed the \\"North American Old Roman Catholic Church\\". Carfora's Church emphasized non-papal, pre-Vatican I Roman Catholic theology and practice, with the exception of permitting a married priesthood. The church grew over several decades under Carfora's leadership, ultimately reaching a peak membership reported as high as 50,000, consisting largely of ethnic parishes, each serving primarily first generation immigrants of a particular national origin. During his primacy, he consecrated at least thirty bishops to serve Polish, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Mexican, and most successfully, West Indian populations in various parts of the United States where they were to be found in particular concentrations. Carfora established several parishes in the United States and, being a volatile man, often embroiled himself in quarrels and squabbles concerning jurisdiction and church polity with his clergy. It seems that instead of taking the time and patience to work out difficulties, he would discover men with whom he thought he could work better and so would ordain or consecrate them bishops to supply clergy to his latest endeavors, often ignoring earlier efforts and the men he had ordained. Carfora was not averse to doing publicly that which tact would require be done privately and as a result the whole world would be a bemused spectator at what was essentially a \\"family affair\\". This gave rise to many speculations about his work and the Old Catholic Church here in the United States which no doubt contributed to many of the problems encountered by Old Catholicism in its efforts to establish itself in the new country. Carfora, circa 1918 By the 1950s, several factors combined to threaten the continued viability of the church, including the assimilation of ethnic groups served by the church into the mainstream culture, a reduced interest among Americans in religion in general, and internal rivalries. For a time, plans were explored to merge with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, but Carfora ultimately abandoned the idea. In 1952, thirty parishes defied his decision and became Ukrainian Orthodox. In 1953, Carfora entered a Roman Catholic hospital in Galveston, Texas, where he was pressured by Roman Catholic authorities to renounce his work. His episcopal ring was stolen and, suffering from heart disease and asthma, he went into a seclusion that amounted to retirement, retaining leadership of the church in title only. Several of his bishops took this opportunity to establish their own churches, often taking congregations with them. Others simply ceased to thrive. According to his death certificate, Carfora died on January 18, 1958. The cause of his death was cancer of the pancreas. He was buried in the Irving Park Cemetery in Chicago on January 21, 1958 and was survived by his wife Stella. His grave stone was defaced many times and the stone was removed.

When a Mac that supports Target Disk Mode is started with the 'T' key held down, its operating system does not boot. Instead, the Mac's firmware enables its drives to behave as a SCSI, FireWire, Thunderbolt and/or USB-C external mass storage device. A Mac booted in Target Mode can be attached to the port of any other computer - Mac or PC - where it will appear as an external device. Hard drives within the target Mac, for example, can be formatted, partitioned, etc., exactly like any other external drive. Some computers will also make their internal CD/DVD drives and other internal and external peripheral hardware available to the host computer.Griffiths, Rob. \\"Borrow an optical drive from another Mac\\", \\"Macworld\\", March 27, 2007. (retrieved October 8, 2010) Target Disk Mode is useful for accessing the contents of a Mac which cannot be booted from its own operating system. Target Disk Mode is the preferred form of old- computer to new-computer interconnect used by Apple's Migration Assistant. Migration Assistant supports Ethernet (wired) or Wi-Fi, which TDM does not. Neither supports USB; however, Thunderbolt-to-Firewire, Thunderbolt-to- Gigabit-Ethernet and USB-3.0-to-Gigabit-Ethernet adapters are an option when one of the computers does not have Firewire or Thunderbolt. History Apple introduced disk mode access with the original PowerBook 100 and continued to offer it with most subsequent PowerBook series and FireWire-equipped Macs. As long as the requisite software appeared in the system ROM, the Mac could be booted into disk mode. Originally called SCSI Disk Mode, a special cable (SCSI System Cable) allowed the original PowerBook series to attach to a desktop Mac as an external SCSI disk. A unique system control panel on the PowerBook was used to select a non-conflicting SCSI ID number from the host Mac. This also made it possible to select the disk in the Startup control panel and boot up from it. With the change to IDE drives starting with the PowerBook 150 and 190, Apple implemented HD Target Mode, which essentially enabled SCSI Disk Mode by translating the external SCSI commands via the ATA driver. Officially reserved for Apple's portables only, all PowerBooks exclusively supported disk mode except the 140, 145, 145B, 150 and 170. However, SCSI Disk Mode can be implemented unofficially on any Macintosh with an external SCSI port, by suspending the startup process with the interrupt switch, as long as all internal drives on the chain can be set to different IDs than the active host system's devices. When Apple dropped the SCSI interface, starting with the AGP Power Mac G4 and ‚ÄúPismo‚Äù PowerBook G3 FireWire Target Disk mode replaced the earlier disk mode implementation, also receiving official support beyond laptops to all subsequent Macs with built-in Firewire. Thunderbolt supports Target Disk Mode. The 12-inch Retina MacBook (early 2015) has only one expansion port, a USB-C port that supports charging, external displays, and Target Disk Mode. Using Target Disk Mode on this MacBook requires a cable that supports USB 3.0 or USB 3.1, with either a USB-A or USB-C connector on one end and a USB-C connector on the other end for the MacBook.https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204360  System requirements  The target computer (the computer to be placed into TDM) must have: * A FireWire or Thunderbolt Port * An ATA device at ATA bus 0 * Any Macintosh except the following models: ** iMac (Tray-Loading) ** Power Macintosh G3 (Blue & White) ** iBook G3 models without FireWire ** Power Macintosh G4 (PCI Graphics) ** MacBook Air (2008-2009) ** MacBook (Unibody) The host computer (the computer into which the Target Disk Mode booted computer is plugged) merely needs to meet the same requirements as for any external mass storage device using the bus in question, and (if access to native Mac formatted partitions such as the boot volume is desired) support for the correct version of Hierarchical File System. On Classic Mac OS, this means FireWire 2.3.3 or later and Mac OS 8.6 or later are required to use a Firewire target. The host computer may run Microsoft Windows, but with some possible shortcomings: to read a Mac's HFS- formatted partitions, extra drivers such as MacDrive, TransMac, MacDisk, or HFSExplorer are necessary. Users also must ensure their computer possesses appropriate interface hardware in order to physically connect to a Mac in Target Mode. MacDrive also has a read-only option to prevent any accidental editing of the computer in Target Disk Mode; however, this mode cannot be set after an HFS/HFS+ disk is mounted. With the addition of HFS drivers into Apple's Bootcamp, it has also become possible for Macs running Windows to read (but not write) HFS partitions, without the purchase of software. Users have separated these drivers from the main Bootcamp install, and now also install on other Windows computers. Host computers running Linux are also able to read and write to a Mac's HFS or HFS+ formatted devices through Target Disk Mode. It is working out-of-the-box on most distributions as HFS+ support is part of the Linux kernel. However these filesystems cannot be checked for errors, so for shrinking or moving partitions it is preferred to use Mac OS.

However, there are features that are unique to California. With roots in the cultures of Spain, Asia, Mexico, and the eastern United States, California integrates foods, languages and traditions from all over the world. Spain had explored the present state of California since the 16th century, although it did not colonize it and exert its cultural influence in earnest until the 18th century. By the 19th century, Spain had built missions throughout all the state and California owned huge land extensions (called \\"ranchos\\"). From that time to the present, Hispanic Californians have always been among the largest cultural groups in the state. Furthermore, Mexican immigration into California has also resulted in a large share of cultural contributions. California culture has also been greatly influenced by African Americans as well as other large populations, especially immigrant groups from East Asia and Latin America. California is a true melting pot as well as an international gateway to the United States. California has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise. In the early 20th Century, fueled by the efforts of state and local boosters, many Americans saw the Golden State as an ideal resort destination, sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean, deserts, and mountains. In the 1960s, popular music groups such as the Beach Boys promoted the image of Californians as laid-back, tanned beach-goers. In terms of socio-cultural mores and national politics, Californians are perceived as more liberal than most other Americans, especially those who live in the coastal or northern regions of California. The state, in whole, is perceived as liberal, though the northeast region (predominantly the area covering the California half of the proposed State of Jefferson) and certain parts of the southern region (i.e. Orange County) are more conservative. California is also home to many prestigious universities including Stanford University, the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, the University of Southern California, the California State University and the Claremont Colleges. The California Gold Rush of the 1850s is still seen as a symbol of California's modern economic style, a pioneering spirit that tends to generate technology, social ventures, entertainment, and economic fads and booms that, in many cases, are followed all around the globe. The hippie movement began in San Francisco, California, in the early 1960s and progressed into the late 1970s. Language English is the main language of California's inhabitants. Spanish is a very common second language all over the state. California English is a dialect of the English language spoken within California. California is the home to a highly diverse populace, and this is reflected in many other languages, especially Spanish. As is the case of English is spoken in any state, not all features of California English is used by all speakers in the state, and not all features are restricted in use only to the state. However, there are some linguistic features which can be identified as either originally or predominantly Californian. As the nation's major motion picture and television entertainment center, Hollywood has influenced English throughout the world, by making English speakers of many dialects very visible and by making known new terms and new meanings. The media outlets and entertainment industry based in California also popularizes the California English accent and dialect to the rest of the country and the world. The official language of California has been English since the passage of Proposition 63 in 1986. However, many state, city, and local government agencies print official public documents in Spanish and other languages since Proposition 63 doesn't regulate how governments use other languages. The Indigenous Farm worker Study of 2007-2009 found 23 languages of Mexico and Mesoamerica spoken in California. California was once home to 300 Native American languages spoken by indigenous people. Arts Architecture San Gabriel Civic Auditorium, an example of Mission Revival Style architecture Apart from the architecture of the California missions and other colonial buildings, there are still many architectonic reminiscences of the Spanish period, especially in Southern California, where white stucco walls, red roof tiles, curvilinear gables, arched windows, balconies or even bell towers are incorporated into modern building styles in what is known as the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, a United States architectural stylistic movement that came about in the early 20th century. While Spanish architectural styles appear statewide, Northern Californian cities more prominently feature historic Victorian architecture, for which San Francisco is renowned, but which dominates the central historic districts of most Northern California towns. The towns of Eureka and Ferndale, in Humboldt County, are particularly noteworthy for their well-preserved Victorian building stock. Today's architecture in California is a mixture of many other cultural influences that has resulted in groundbreaking modernist styles that have generated many other interesting and unusual building types. Film The American Film industry. California is home to Hollywood (a district of Los Angeles), the center of the American film industry, which has given rise to the popular fashion movie-star image and stereotypical life styles such as beach-dwelling surfers. Hollywood has had a profound effect on culture all across the world since the early 20th century. During the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood, which lasted from the end of the silent era in American cinema in the late 1920s to the late 1950s, thousands of movies were released from Hollywood studios. Spectacular epics, which took advantage of new widescreen processes from the 1950s, have become increasingly popular. Today, in spite of fierce competition from other countries and even other states within the US, California still dominates the industry. Music The guitar was the instrument that the Mexican state of Alta California chose and two composers for the instrument are represented in the collection. Manuel Y. Ferrer's were collected in a book of 144 pages, called \\"Compositions and Arrangements for the Guitar\\" published in San Francisco in 1882, then reprinted in Boston by Oliver Ditson in 1915. Many of his pieces appear in the sheet music collection. An additional Californian artist, of the name of Luis T. Romero is represented his 1889 arrangement for guitar of La Paloma by Yradier. In 1898, a collection called \\"Characteristic Songs of the Spanish Californians\\" was published as Canciones del Pais de California\\" in Santa Barbara. California is the birthplace of a number of international renowned music genres, including: *West coast hip hop, e.g. Tupac Shakur, N.W.A., Tyler, the Creator, Tyga, Kendrick Lamar, G-Eazy, Kid Ink, Blueface *West coast jazz *West coast blues *G Funk, e.g. Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre * Hyphy, e.g. Mac Dre, E-40 *Fusion Reggae, e.g. Slightly Stoopid, Rebelution, Iration, Dirty Heads, and Stick Figure *Third wave ska with bands such as Reel Big Fish, Suburban Rhythm, Sublime, and No Doubt. *Bay Area thrash metal, e.g. Metallica, Exodus *Alternative rock/nu metal, e.g. Korn, Deftones, Linkin Park, P.O.D *Stoner rock, e.g. Sleep, Kyuss *Skate punk, e.g. The Offspring, NOFX, Bad Religion, Pennywise, Suicidal Tendencies, Rancid, Guttermouth, Black Flag, Face to Face, Descendents *Funk rock, e.g. Red Hot Chili Peppers, Primus, Incubus, Mr. Bungle *Experimental music, e.g. Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, Beck *Psychedelic rock, e.g. Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, The Doors, Moby Grape, Sly and the Family Stone *Bakersfield sound, e.g. Buck Owens and the Buckaroos, Tommy Collins, Merle Haggard *Surf rock, e.g. The Beach Boys Other well-known artists from California from genres which did not originate in the state include: *Heavy metal: Guns N' Roses, Van Halen, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Megadeth, Slayer *Rock: Eagles, Counting Crows, Jane's Addiction, Journey, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Faith No More, The Byrds, Rage Against the Machine *Punk: Dead Kennedys, Circle Jerks, Green Day *Latin rock: Santana, Ritchie Valens *Soft rock, e.g. The Carpenters The song Hotel California by the Eagles references this state. Literature Notable authors who were either native to California or who wrote extensively about California include: * Juan Bautista Zappa, the author of the \\"Estrella del Norte de M√©xico\\" published in Seville on 1668, that was known as the \\"guide for the spiritual conquest of the Californias\\". * Miguel Venegas, who published \\"Noticia de la California\\" in 1757, that was subsequently translated into English (1759), Dutch (1761‚Äì1762), French (1766‚Äì1767), and German (1769‚Äì1770), becoming the standard source for information about the early Californias. * Richard Henry Dana, Jr., recounted aspects of Californio culture which he saw during his 1834 visit as a sailor in Two Years Before the Mast. * Helen Hunt Jackson, depicted a portrayal of Californio culture in her novel Ramona (1884) * John Steinbeck, was widely known as a regionalist, mystic, and proletarian writer. A prolific writer, he is one of the best known and read writers of the 20th Century. * Gerald Haslam, \\"the quintessential California writer,\\" whose fiction and non- fiction is set mainly in the Great Central Valley. * Joan Didion, the author of five novels and eight books of nonfiction * Wallace Stegner, known as the \\"Dean of Western Writers\\" *James D. Houston, protege of Stegner, whose novels and non-fiction helped define post-WWII California. * Raymond Chandler, who wrote about the dark underbelly of mid-20th Century Los Angeles * John Muir, who spent years in the Sierras and brought Yosemite to international prominence * Ken Kesey, a counter-cultural figure; was an American author, best known for his novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest * Ross Macdonald (Ken Millar), his post WWII work refined the noir novel in California. * Richard Henry Dana, Jr., who wrote about his 19th Century voyage to California and the namesake of Dana Point * Mar√≠a Ruiz de Burton, the first female Mexican-American author to write in English; wrote The Squatter and the Don, under the pen name \\"C.

Dick, prominent Science Fiction writer. * Frederick Kohner, Wrote the 1957 book about his daughter nicknamed Gidget The novel publication was seminal in the global dissemination of the Southern California Beach and Surf culture as both an influential book and film / television series. Museums California has notable museums: * The California Museum in the state capitol of Sacramento, CA is the official museum of the California State Archives. Originally named the Golden State Museum, it opened in June 1998 under the development of the Secretary of State‚Äôs office to display contents of the state archives. Soon after her husband Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was sworn in as governor in 2003, First Lady Maria Shriver began working with the Secretary of State and California State Parks to expand the Museum. In 2006, The California Museum became home to the California Hall of Fame, the most notable and diverse of all The California Museum's permanent exhibits. * The Oakland Museum of California in Oakland. The Museum is dedicated to the history, natural sciences and art that define the people, history and the future of California. * The Getty Center in Los Angeles. One of the wealthiest art museums in the world. * Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) * The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles. * California Science Center, the West Coast's largest hands-on science center, in Los Angeles. * The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the largest natural and historical museum in the Western US. * California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. A fine art museum. * San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco. * The Exploratorium in San Francisco. A hands-on museum of science, art, and human perception. * California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. Operated by the California State Parks system, the museum chronicles the history of railroads in California * Colton Hall, signing place of The California Constitution * California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. One of the ten largest museums of natural history in the world. Cuisine California‚Äòs many immigrants bring their culinary traditions to the state. Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Vietnamese, and Indian food, as well as many other foreign foods, can be found throughout California. In 1903, The Landmarks Club Cookbook (which was published as a fundraiser to restore California's Spanish missions) claimed that Los Angeles had the most diverse cuisine of any city. Produce plays an important role in California cuisine. California encompasses many diverse climates and therefore is able to grow many types of produce. Additionally, California's Central Valley contains some of the most fertile soil in the world. California is the number one U.S. producer of many common fruits and vegetables, including broccoli, spinach, tomatoes and avocados, amongst others. A health-conscious culture also contributes to the popularity of fresh produce. Fruit festivals, such as the National Orange Show Festival in San Bernardino County, are common throughout the state. Avocados play a special role in California cuisine. Many popular California dishes integrate avocados and/or guacamole. Avocados were unfamiliar to most Americans until the mid-20th century, when growers of the subtropical fruit successfully convinced many Americans to try it. In California, avocado is commonly used in sandwiches, hamburgers, salads and even on pizza, in addition to tacos, and other Mexican foods. California is also an important producer of tomatoes. California tomatoes have become a staple ingredient in ketchup, though ketchup was originally made with everything from plums to mushrooms. With Napa Valley in the north, Santa Barbara, and the Temecula Valley in the southern part of the state, California is the world's fourth largest producer of wines, and accounts for 90 percent of the wine production in the United States. Originally started by Spanish settlers to create wine for Mass in the 18th century, the wine industry in California rivals other wine-producing countries of the world, such as France, Australia and Chile, even winning the Judgment of Paris wine competition. In- N-Out burgers McDonald's, In-n-Out, Jack in the Box, Rubio's, Round Table Pizza, Taco Bell, Del Taco, Jamba Juice, Carl‚Äôs Jr., California Pizza Kitchen, Wienerschnitzel and The Cheesecake Factory have origins in California. California combines American, Mexican, Mediterranean and Asian cuisine plus the trend for a healthy lifestyle and food with strong accent of seasonality. What many people don‚Äôt know: there are also fine local wines. It is a real paradise for gourmets who can choose from a wide variety of flavours and ways of feasting ‚Äì as the joy of dining together is as important as the cuisine specialties. Environmentalism California has a reputation for environmentalism. Californians, especially those living on the coasts, are viewed as being advocates of environmental issues. The environmental culture of California can be partly attributed to public outrage at the major oil spill in the Santa Barbara Channel in 1969. The influential social conditions resulting from this oil spill are explained in detail by environmental sociologist Harvey Molotch. In 1965, California became the first state to regulate vehicle exhaust by setting limits on hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions. In 1967, the California EPA set the nation's first air quality standards for total suspended particulates, photochemical oxidants, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and other pollutants. The United States Congress has allowed California to set its own pollution standards, and the state's legislators have responded with some of the strongest environmental laws ever passed. Some Californians are concerned about the rising water levels that will be caused by global warming which will threaten areas along the coast. Additionally, with warming trends at their present rates, experts generally agree that the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which is crucial to the state's drinking water, could decline by approximately 50 percent. Education Public Universities & Colleges California offers a unique three-tier system of public postsecondary education: :The preeminent research university system in the state is the University of California (UC), which employs more Nobel Prize laureates than any other institution in the world, and is considered one of the world's finest public university systems. There are nine general UC campuses (most notably at Berkeley and Los Angeles), and a number of specialized campuses in the UC system. :The California State University (CSU) system has over 400,000 students, making it the largest university system in the United States. It is the oldest public institution of higher learning in the State of California, and is intended to accept the top one- third (1/3) of high school students. The CSU campuses were originally separately-established normal schools, but are now organized in a comprehensive university system, awarding Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctoral degrees. :The California Community Colleges system provides lower division courses. It is composed of 109 colleges, serving a student population of over 2.9 million. Private Universities & Colleges California is also home to such notable private universities as Stanford University, the Claremont Colleges, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and the University of Southern California (USC). California has hundreds of other private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions. Public secondary education consists of high schools that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students. California's public educational system is supported by a unique constitutional amendment that requires 40% of state revenues to be spent on education. Beach culture The state's proximity to the ocean influences many aspects of California culture and daily life. Surfing is an extremely popular sport in California, where the famed spots of Trestles, Rincon, Mavericks, The Wedge, Malibu, and \\"Surf City, USA\\" reside. Some of the world's most renowned surf companies, including Hurley, Quiksilver, Volcom, O'Neill, Body Glove, RVCA are all headquartered in California. Older surfers such as Corky Carroll, Robert August, Hobie Alter as well as some of today's most renowned surfers, including Bobby Martinez, Dane Reynolds, Tom Curren, Taylor Knox, and Rob Machado are all from California. Many surfing magazines are also headquartered in California, including Surfing Magazine, Surfer (magazine), and Surfer's Journal. In the 1960s, surfing became immensely popular due to surf rock bands like the Beach Boys, surf films like Bruce Brown's The Endless Summer, and Hollywood blockbusters like Gidget. Due to this mainstream surf culture explosion, surfing soon embodied the ideal Californian lifestyle and became a teen sensation as well as a sport.Ormrod, Joan. \\"Endless Summer (1964): Consuming Waves and Surfing the Frontier.\\" Film & History: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Film and Television Studies 35.1 (2005): 39-51. EBSCOhost. Web. 18 August 2012. Malibu, California was at the heart of surf culture not only because it is a world-class surf spot, but also due to its youthful \\"beach\\" atmosphere and warm weather. Young men began strutting around the beach in boardshorts and women wore more revealing bikini swim suits, which, along with the surfboard, became symbols of beach culture. The surf culture boom of the 1960s soon led to an enormous increase of surfers at beaches around the country and helped surfing develop into the sport it is today. Surfing (particularly in Southern California) has its own slang, which has coincided with Valspeak. Words like \\"tubular\\", \\"radical\\", and \\"gnarly\\" and the overuse of the word \\"like\\" are associated with both. In the late 1960s, Santa Cruz and Northern California developed their own slang like \\"groovy\\", \\"hella\\", and \\"tight\\". Northern‚ÄìSouthern California rivalry Although unified as a single state, northern California and southern California share a rivalry. \\"NorCal\\" or \\"SoCal\\" pride is a large part of many residents' culture. This has historically manifested through differences in regional dialect, as well as politics. Southern California has historically been more conservative in comparison to northern California. Northern California has been more liberal, to the point that the term \\"San Francisco values\\" has become a pejorative among conservatives in both state and national politics. An early example of this divide was the 1860 Presidential election, in which Southern Democrat John C. Breckinridge won in the southern counties, while the more populous San Francisco Bay Area carried the entire state for Abraham Lincoln. The rivalry also manifests itself in professional sports, such as rivalries between the following teams: * San Francisco Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers * Oakland Athletics and the Los Angeles Angels * San Jose Sharks, Anaheim Ducks and Los Angeles Kings * San Jose Earthquakes and the Los Angeles Galaxy * Both the Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings and the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers * San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams See also * History of California * California Myth * Cuisine of California * Music of California * California Mille  References  Bibliography * External links Arts and Culture * California Arts Council * California Council for the Humanities * Art California Web Portal Places to visit *List of Beaches *Museums Sports/Recreation *Hiking *Rafting + Snowboarding *Bicycling  Further reading  Articles about *California: the Dream and the Challenge in the Twenty-first Century by Kevin Starr * Portrait of California: History & Culture ?A State is Born * 50 reasons to Love California *California Here we Come * The Californian * Los Angeles Times * Hollywood Reporter * ","title":"Culture of California"},{"id":"8077789","title":"Shaximiao Formation"},{"id":"8077803","text":"Tonite is an explosive sometimes used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It consists of a mixture of equal weights of barium nitrate and guncotton. According to Nitro-Explosives: A Practical Treatise by P.

Various nitrates have been used (nitre, potassium nitrate, barium nitrate, ammonium nitrate). The explosive was patented in 1874 by Messrs Trench, Faure, and Mackie. The high gas pressures generated by detonation of Tonite resulted in it being used as a bursting charge for some early hand grenades used in World War I.

This is the first time the Haitian has been observed to speak, and in fact, the previous dialogue in the episode indicated that Eden and Mr. Bennet didn't even know the Haitian could speak. Nathan arranges for Peter's release, but when they leave the police station, Peter begins coughing and collapses, unconscious. Peter has what appears to be a vision of New York City. Peter looks around and the other major characters start appearing out of various places. Matt stops Peter and leads D.L., Niki, and Micah away from him. Peter looks at his hands which have begun to glow bright orange. After Nathan approaches close enough, Peter screams as his whole body turns orange and explodes.

Ancient Greek and Latin Resolution is generally found in Greek lyric poetry and in Greek and Roman drama, most frequently in comedy. It should not be confused with a biceps, which is a point in a meter which can equally be two shorts or a long, as is found in the dactylic hexameter. The biceps is freely able to be two shorts or a long, while resolution, particularly in tragedy, can only occur within very restricted situations. Two resolved longa in the same line is unusual, for instance, while a biceps that is two shorts can freely be followed by another biceps that is two shorts. Also, when two shorts are substituted for a long, they are almost always within the same word-unit. One example from iambic trimeter: : : :u ‚Äì u ‚Äì u uu u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì :\\"Whose sacred name would I pray to when I hear it?\\" : (Sophocles, Oedipus at Colonus 41) Here the resolved pair is the word ·ΩÑŒΩŒøŒº', so the resolution stays within the same word-unit. Germanic alliterative verse In the alliterative verse tradition of the ancient and medieval Germanic languages, resolution was also an important feature. In this tradition, if a stressed syllable comprises a short root vowel followed by only one consonant followed by an unstressed vowel (i.e. '(-)CVCV(-)) these two syllables were in most circumstances counted as only one syllable.Jun Terasawa, Old English Metre: An Introduction (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp. 31-33.

The MPs, from the Ulster Unionist Party, Democratic Unionist Party and Ulster Popular Unionist Party, did this to highlight their opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Each of their parties agreed not to contest seats previously held by the others, and each outgoing MP stood for re-election. Other candidates Of the remaining two seats in Northern Ireland, Foyle was held by the Nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), while Belfast West was held by the republican party Sinn F√©in. These MPs did not resign and their seats were not contested. The SDLP and Sinn F√©in regarded the resignations as a publicity stunt, and were reluctant to take part in the resulting by-elections. In the event, they contested only the seats which they believed to have an anti-unionist majority. The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland instructed its branches to nominate a candidate for each by-election, but many were reluctant, and ultimately, the party stood in only five seats. The small Workers' Party also stood, in nine seats. In four constituencies, no political party was willing to contest the by-election. This effectively made these the last uncontested by-elections in British history. However, to ensure that there was a contest and the Unionists would be able to demonstrate their point, Wesley Robert Williamson changed his name by deed poll to \\"Peter Barry\\", Peter Barry being Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Ireland. \\"Peter Barry\\" stood in these four constituencies under the label \\"For the Anglo-Irish Agreement\\", allowing a contest, but did not campaign. The unusual circumstances led this to be the greatest number of UK Parliamentary by-elections ever held on a single day. Results Aggregate results The aggregated results for all constituencies are shown below. Changes are compared to the aggregate results for the 15 constituencies in the 1983 general election. All but one of the Unionists were re-elected, many with extremely large majorities. The largest of all went to Ian Paisley in North Antrim. He won 97.4% of the vote, the highest percentage polled by any candidate in a UK by-election since the 1940 Middleton and Prestwich by-election. The sole exception to this pattern was the Newry and Armagh by-election, where Seamus Mallon of the SDLP was able to take the seat. Former Cabinet Minister Enoch Powell was able to narrowly survive a strong challenge from the SDLP in South Down and was subsequently defeated at the following year's general election. In the western constituencies of Mid Ulster and Fermanagh and South Tyrone the Unionist candidates were able to survive with less than 50% of the vote due to a split Nationalist vote and both seats were gained by Sinn F√©in in later elections. The results of the fifteen by- elections were cited by Unionists as a rejection of the Agreement by the Northern Irish electorate, but did not succeed in repealing it.

Simply, they occur when vaccines fail to provide immunity against the pathogen they are designed to target. Breakthrough infections have been identified in individuals immunized against a variety of different diseases including Mumps, Varicella (Chicken Pox), and Influenza. The character of breakthrough infections is dependent on the virus itself. Often, the infection in the vaccinated individual results in milder symptoms and is of a shorter duration than if the infection was contracted naturally. Causes of breakthrough infections include improper administration or storage of vaccines, mutations in viruses and antibody blocking. For these reasons, vaccines are rarely 100% effective. The common flu vaccine is estimated to provide immunity to the flu in 58% of recipients. The measles vaccine fails to provide immunity to 2% of children that receive the vaccine. However, if herd immunity exists, it typically prevents individuals who are ineffectively vaccinated from contracting the disease. Accordingly, herd immunity reduces the number of breakthrough infections in a population.  Characteristics   Breakthrough Varicella  The varicella vaccine is 85% effective at preventing varicella infection. However, 75% of individuals that are diagnosed with breakthrough varicella exhibit milder symptoms than individuals that are not vaccinated. These individuals with mild varicella have low fevers, fewer than 50 lesions on their skin and a maculopapular rashes. In contrast, unvaccinated individuals typically have a fever of 102, 200-500 skin lesions and macules (lesions that are not elevated) evolve to papules and vesicular lesions. Additionally, infection in unvaccinated individuals tends to last for a longer period of time than in individuals who have been infected. The majority of cases of breakthrough varicella are attributed to the failure of an individual to uptake the varicella vaccine. Therefore, to prevent breakthrough infections, it is proposed that children receive a second dose of varicella vaccine less than a year after getting their first dose.  Breakthrough Mumps  The mumps vaccine is a component of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine (MMR). The mumps vaccine, specifically, is 88% effective at preventing mumps. Individuals with breakthrough cases of mumps have fewer serious complications from the infections as compared to individuals unvaccinated for mumps. These complications include the development of aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. The cause of breakthrough mumps is not currently completely understood. Evolution of the virus (antigenic drift) is thought to explain the majority of breakthrough cases. Other theories suggest that memory T lymphocytes play a role in the development of breakthrough infections.  Breakthrough Hepatitis B  Breakthrough cases of Hepatitis B are primarily attributed to mutations in the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) that make HBV surface proteins unrecognizable to antibodies produced from the HBV vaccine. Viruses with such mutations are called ‚Äúvaccine escape mutants‚Äù. Breakthrough infections may also be caused by delayed vaccination, immunosuppression, and maternal viral load. It is possible for an individual to have breakthrough infection of HBV but be asymptomatic.  Biological Causes   Age  As a person ages, their immune system undergoes a series of changes, in a process referred to as immunosenescence. Notable among these changes is a decreased production of naive T cells and naive B cells. The reduced number of naive lymphocytes (T and B cells) is attributed to the fact that the telomeres in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), degenerate over time and, consequently, limit the proliferation of HSCs and production of lymphoid progenitor cells. This is compounded by the fact that, with time, HSCs tend to favor the production of myeloid progenitor cells over lymphoid progenitor cells. Mature lymphocytes are also unable to proliferate indefinitely. Compounded, the reduction in number of naive lymphocytes and limitations of the proliferative abilities of mature lymphocytes contribute to a limited number and variety of lymphocytes to respond to pathogens presented in a vaccine. Indeed, vaccines, including the influenza vaccine, Tdap, and pneumococcal vaccines, are less effective in adults over the age of 65. Nevertheless, the CDC recommends that elderly adults get the flu vaccine because influenza infection is particularly dangerous in this population and vaccine provides at least a moderate level of immunity to the flu virus.  Antibody Interference  The presence of maternal antibodies in infants limits the efficacy of inactivated, attenuated and subunit vaccines. Maternal antibodies can bind to epitopes on the proteins produced by the virus in the vaccination. The recognition of viral proteins by maternal antibodies neutralizes the virus. Further, the maternal antibodies outcompete B cell receptors on the infant's B cells for binding to the antigen. Thus, an infant's immune system is not highly activated and the infant produces fewer antibodies. Even when B cells do bind to the pathogen, immune response is still frequently repressed. If B cell receptors bind to the antigen and FC receptors simultaneously bind to the maternal antibody, the FC receptors send a signal to B cell receptors that inhibits cell division. Because the infant's immune system is not stimulated and B cell division is inhibited, few memory B cells are produced. The level of memory B-cells is not adequate to ensure an infant's lifelong resistance to the pathogen. In most infants, maternal antibodies disappear 12‚Äì15 months after birth, so vaccines administered outside this window are not compromised by maternal antibody interference.  Longevity of Memory B Cells  When an individual is vaccinated against a disease, the individual's immune system is triggered and memory B cells store the specific antibody response. These cells remain in circulation the pathogen infection is cleared. Because the telomeres in genes degenerate after each successive cell division, lymphocytes, including memory B cells are not capable of proliferating indefinitely. Typically, the cells live for multiple decades, but there is variation in the longevity of these cells depending on the type of vaccine they were stimulated with and vaccine dosage. The reason for the differences in the longevity of memory B cells is currently unknown. However, it has been proposed that the differences in memory B cell longevity are due to the speed at which a pathogen infects the body and, accordingly, the number and type of cells involved in the immune response to the pathogen in the vaccine.  Virus Evolution  When a person is vaccinated, their immune system develops antibodies that recognize specific segments (epitopes) viruses or viral-induced proteins. Over time, however, viruses accumulate genetic mutations which can impact the 3d structure of viral proteins. If these mutations occur in sites that are recognized by antibodies, the mutations block antibody binding which inhibits the immune response. This phenomenon is called antigenic drift. Breakthrough infections of Hepatitis B and mumps are partially attributed to antigenic drift.  Other Causes   Vaccine Quality and Administration  Vaccines may fail to provide immunity if the vaccine is of poor quality when administered. A vaccine loses potency if it is stored at the incorrect temperature or if it is kept after the expiration date. Similarly, appropriate vaccine dosage is essential to ensuring immunity. Vaccine dosage is dependent on factors including a patient‚Äôs age and weight. Failure to account for these factors can lead to patients receiving an incorrect amount of vaccination. Patients that receive a lower dose than recommended of a vaccine do not have an adequate immune response to the vaccine to ensure immunity. In order for a vaccine to be effective, an individual must respond to the pathogens in a vaccine through the adaptive branch of the immune system and that response must be stored in an individual's immunological memory. It is possible for an individual to neutralize and clear a pathogen through the humoral response without activating the adaptive immune response. Vaccines with weaker or fewer strains of a pathogen, as is the case when a vaccine is of poor quality when administered, may primarily elicit the humoral response, and, thus, fail to ensure future immunity.

It is one of 26 sites within the Long Term Ecological Research Network. The Konza prairie was designated a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1978. It was one of 17 reserves in the United States withdrawn from the programme in June 2017 by request of the U.S. government. It has a continental climate characterized by warm, wet summers and dry, cold winters. Average annual precipitation (32.9 in, 835 mm) is sufficient to support woodland or savanna vegetation; consequently, drought, fire and grazing are important in maintaining this grassland. The site is topographically complex with an elevation range from 1050 to 1457 ft (320 to 444 m). In addition to the dominant tallgrass prairie, Konza contains forest, claypan, shrub and riparian communities. Limestone outcrops are found throughout the landscape.

He was a cofounder of the National League for Democracy and served as president of the party.  Early life  He was born to a Burmese Chinese family in Paungde, British Burma in 1919.  Military career  Aung Gyi was member of General Ne Win's 4th Burma Rifles rising to Brigadier General. He played a role in the caretaker government of 1958-60 led by Ne Win. Aung Gyi was number two in the Union Revolutionary Council set up after the 1962 coup, serving as vice-chief of staff and Minister of Trade and Industry until he was forced to resign on 8 February 1963 because of disagreements over economic policy with Ba Nyein and Tin Pe. He was once known as Ne Win's heir apparent. In his memoirs, \\"Saturday's Son\\", published in 1974, U Nu, then Prime Minister of Myanmar, claimed that his handover of power to the caretaker government was not voluntary but that a group of Army Officers led by Brigadier Aung Gyi and Brigadier Maung Maung threatened him with a \\"straight military coup\\" should he refuse to handover power to Ne Win. The suggestion that this coup was mainly led by Brigadier Aung Gyi and Maung Maung was supported Col Hla Maw, former commanding officer of 11th Brigade. Aung Gyi's role in suppressing the anti- government student protests in 1962 is not clear. In his resignation speech of 23 July 1988, Ne Win blamed Aung Gyi as \\"the real culprit\\" in the destruction of the Rangoon University Student Union Building on 8 July 1962. Aung Gyi was ousted in 1963, when he criticized the Council's economic policies, and for statements made in Japan about the cause of the 1962 coup. He was imprisoned in 1965-68 and again in 1973-74. However, Aung Gyi remained loyal to the Tatmadaw, the armed forces, and his connection with Ne Win remained intact despite his later blunt criticism of the government. Prior to the 8888 Uprising, Aung Gyi had written several long open letters, widely distributed throughout the country, to Ne Win criticising the government, and they became an important factor for the opposition movement. On 7 March 1988, Aung Gyi wrote his first letter to Ne Win, suggesting economic reforms and a new cabinet. He strongly criticised the government's Burmese Way to Socialism and warned of possible social unrest. On 9 May 1988 he wrote a second 40-page open letter, reiterating the need for economic reforms. In 1988, he emerged as prominent opposition leader and was imprisoned between 29 July and 25 August 1988. However, he remained a supporter of Ne Win and the army. Just before the army staged its coup on 18 September 1988, he told a crowd that he guaranteed that the army would not stage a coup and the interim government will be formed very soon: \\"I will kill myself, [if the army staged a coup]\\". After the coup, Aung Gyi told people who came to listen his speech that they \\"must not think bad (or 'sin' against) the army even in your minds\\".  Founding NLD Party  The National League for Democracy was formed on 27 September 1988, with Aung Gyi as President, former General Thura Tin Oo as Vice President and Aung San Suu Kyi as General Secretary. He resigned on 3 December 1988 from the National League for Democracy (NLD), alleging communist infiltration, to form the Union National Democracy Party (UNDP) on 16 December 1988. Only one candidate from the UNDP was elected in the Myanmar general elections that were held in May 1990. At those elections, there were 485 constituencies. The NLD fielded 447 candidates, and 392 were elected. In 1993 Aung Gyi was sentenced to six months imprisonment for not paying a bill for eggs. In 1998 he visited the United States and recorded an extensive interview with Radio Free Asia. When asked about the army, he said: \\"People despise the Tatmadaw. This is a bad sign. The people of Burma have lost faith in the Tatmadaw.\\" While he acknowledged the corruption and nepotism of the top junta leaders, he considered that democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was surrounded by communists, the same accusations made by the junta. He blamed the NLD for boycotting the National Convention established to draft a new Constitution. He said, \\"I want U Ne Win to contribute something before he dies, because he knows what is right and wrong\\". He stated that Ne Win was still influential and had ordered the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to change the name of the government and reshape the Cabinet in 1997. Aung Gyi was among the few who attended the funeral of Ne Win in 2002 who spoke fondly of Ne Win's achievements in helping bring independence to Myanmar in 1948, but he also stated that \\"Ne Win betrayed Burma and Ne Win betrayed the country. He committed rape of democracy in Burma by staging a coup. He died an inglorious death. It was a sad and tragic ending\\". Death On 25 October 2012, Aung Gyi died at his home in Mayangone Township, Yangon, Myanmar because of heart failure. He is survived by his wife Mu Mu Thein, 4 children and 5 grandchildren.

The current Stanley Memorial Building opened to the public on November 28, 2016. This branch's buildings have been named after the family of Charles H. Stanley, a city commissioner (1880‚Äì1882), mayor (1891‚Äì1893), and state comptroller (1911‚Äì1912). Friends of the Laurel Library, a philanthropic group of local community members, has supported the branch since January 1996. Features The library features over 50,000 books, DVDs, and magazines. Patrons have access to color printers and 53 computers. A double-sided fireplace offers warmth near a reading area, and a children's room uses a dinosaur theme, a nod to the Dinosaur Park near Laurel. A gaming room may be used to play video games. For those short on time, the library has a drive- through window for picking up and returning library materials. The Laurel Branch of the Prince George's County Memorial Library System was the recipient of the 2018 AIA/ALA Library Building Awards for excellence in architectural design. The public art commission for the Laurel library front entrance was awarded to the Washington Glass School. The high glass-and-steel sculpture was made involving the surrounding community and library groups. In a series of glass making workshops, images of books and stories, education and learning, and shared aspirations were created at the Washington Glass School to be incorporated into the internally illuminated tower. History The former branch building, named Stanley Memorial Library, was dedicated on May 7, 1967 and completed a major expansion in 1993. Having outgrown its building, plans were made beginning in 2005 to replace it with a new facility. The library closed on March 8, 2014, and reopened at a temporary location behind the Laurel Municipal Center on March 31, 2014, to allow for construction. After nearly a year of delay, construction of the $14 million project was to begin in October/November 2014 with a grand opening in early 2016. The project's groundbreaking ceremony occurred on May 27, 2015, with an updated opening set for the last quarter of 2016. The Prince George's County Board of Library Trustees decided in January 2014 to remove the Stanley name from the new library, to be consistent in naming branches after their location rather than after people. A coalition of residents, including Mayor Craig Moe, campaigned to keep the Stanley name for historic reasons, and noted that the library was built on land donated by the Stanley family and named in accordance with the deed. Other residents said Charles Stanley was a Confederate soldier and by association was pro-slavery and his name should not be on the building. Library officials ultimately decided to keep the Stanley name on the building and place a memorial plaque in the building's lobby.

Since Alabama could not actually lose its first district, Tyson (a lawyer like Edwards and who served in both houses of the Alabama legislature) had become his party's candidate after the Democratic primary in which he defeated Clara Stone Fields, the only woman in the Alabama legislature during that decade. Edwards became one of five Republicans elected to the House from Alabama amid Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater's sweep of the state in that year's presidential election.

Parker was born at Tredington (which was then in Worcestershire). His father, a clergyman, was a son of Sir Henry Parker. His paternal grandfather had married a daughter of Alexander Hyde, Bishop of Salisbury. He began his career at sea in the merchant service. Entering the Royal Navy at the age of 24, he was made lieutenant in 1744, and in 1748 he was made post-captain.Sir Hyde Parker at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In his royal navy career, he captured a Spanish galleon that was worth ¬£600,000. This gave his family its wealth. Currently, his descendants live in the south wing of Melford Hall. Seven Years War In October 1755 Hyde Parker commissioned the newly-launched post ship . A year later, in her he captured the French privateer Tr√®s V√©nƒórable. During the latter part of the Seven Years' War he served in the East Indies, taking part in the capture of Pondicherry in 1761 and of Manila in 1762. In the latter year Parker with two ships captured one of the valuable Spanish plate ships in her voyage between Acapulco and Manila. American War of Independence In 1778 he became Rear- Admiral and went to North American waters as second-in-command. For some time before George Rodney's arrival he was in command on the Leeward Islands station, and conducted a skilful campaign against the French at Martinique. In 1781, having returned home and become Vice-Admiral, he fell in with a Dutch fleet of about his own force, though far better equipped, near the Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781. After a fiercely contested battle, in which neither combatant gained any advantage, both sides drew off. Parker considered that he had not been properly equipped for his task, and insisted on resigning his command. In 1782 he accepted the East Indies command, though he had just succeeded to the family baronetcy. On the outward voyage his flagship, was lost with all on board. He was succeeded by his eldest son Harry Parker, the sixth Baronet. Parker's second son was Admiral Sir Hyde Parker (1739‚Äì1807).

The title of the book is taken from The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.Marx and Engels, Collected Works (London, Lawrence & Wishart), vol. 6 (1976), p. 487. Berman uses Goethe's Faust as a literary interpretation of modernization, through the processes of dreaming, loving and developing. In the second section he uses Marxist texts to analyze the self- destructive nature of modernization. In the third section French poetry (especially Baudelaire) is used as model of modernist writing, followed by a selection of Russian literature (Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Bely, Gogol and Mandelstam) in the fourth section. The book concludes with some notes on modernism in New York City during the 1960s and 1970s. New York City's subway map is said to have been designed in accordance with Berman's vision of modernity, presented in the book.

NB: some of these bands significantly pre-dated the original riot grrrl era (e.g. Frightwig, Fifth Column, Mecca Normal, Scrawl, L7), while others may be more accurately categorized as grunge - see also 'foxcore' (e.g. Lunachicks, Babes in Toyland, Dickless, Calamity Jane), alternative rock (e.g. Jack Off Jill), hardcore (e.g. Spitboy, Pantychrist), garage punk (e.g. Red Aunts), queercore (e.g. Tribe 8, Team Dresch, the Third Sex, Sta-Prest, the Butchies, the Need), post punk/no wave (e.g. Erase Errata), digital hardcore (Lolita Storm) or indiepop (e.g. Angelica). Other bands did not identify with riot grrrl during its first wave of the early 1990s but became associated via personal and artistic connections (e.g. 7 Year Bitch), or by fans and/or the media due to aesthetic and genre similarities (e.g. Hole, The Gits). On the same basis bands continue to be associated with or self-identify as riot grrrl up to the present day. However, the problematisation of riot grrrl, and of its status as music genre, have led to the label being disputed.Sexing the Groove: Popular Music and Gender, Sheila Whiteley, Routledge, 1997 A list of notable bands that specifically self-identified as riot grrrl during the initial early 1990s period would be very small, potentially including only Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Emily's Sassy Lime and Lucid Nation in the US, and Huggy Bear, Linus, Pussycat Trash and Skinned Teen in the UK. # *7 Year Bitch A *Adickdid *Angelica Bikini Kill B *Babes in Toyland *Bangs *Big Joaniehttps://thevinylfactory.com/features/capturing-the- riot-grrrl-attitude-in-10-records/ *Bikini Kill *Blood SausageAnyone Can Do It: Empowerment, Tradition and the Punk Underground, Pete Dale, Ashgate, 2012 *Bratmobile *The Butchies C *Cadallaca *Calamity Jane *Care Bears on Fire *Casual Dots *The Coathangers *Cold Cold Hearts *Coping Saw *Courtney Love [Nb.

Sometimes, the entire area along Chitpur Road is referred to as Chitpur, although the various localities have distinctive names. History Chitpur has existed for at least 400 years. It received its name from the goddess Chitteswari, who had a splendid temple here erected by Gobindram Mitter, where human sacrifices used to be offered. The lofty dome of the temple, which was known as Nabarutna or the shrine of nine jewels, fell during the earthquake of 1737, and it is now in ruins.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, [1909] (1980), rev. ed., pp. 221, 283, General Printers and Publishers Pvt Ltd. 200px According to another source, the area was earlier named Chitrapur. It is referred to in Bipradas Pipilai's poem Manasamangal in 1495, but it could be a later interpolation. According to it, Chitpur was home to Chakrapani, Commander-in-Chief of the Nawab of Bengal's army, and had a flourishing colony of artists. It refers to one Gobinda Ghosh as founder of the Chitteswari temple in 1610. The most notorious bandit of the region was Chitey Dakat, who offered human sacrifices at the temple. The area could also have acquired its name from him.Gupta, Bunny and Chaliha, Jaya, Chitpur, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, pp. 27-30, Oxford University Press, . The East India Company obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as Dihi Panchannagram and Chitpur was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the Maratha Ditch.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, first published 1909/reprint 1980, pages 103-4 and 221, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd.Nair, P.Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, pp. 14-15, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, 1995 edition. There was a house and garden of Mahmed Reza Khan, the Chitpur Nawab, to whom the administration of Bengal was assigned for several years after the British East India Company acquired the dewani of Bengal from the Mughal emperors in Delhi.Cotton, H.E.A., p. 221, The Chitpur Nawab lived on terms of intimacy with the 'powers' of the day and was accounted by them as a personage of first rank. The foreign governors‚ÄîDanish, French and Dutch‚Äîon their visits to Kolkata from Serampore, Chandannagar and Chinsurah, made it a practice to halt at Chitpur on their way to the Government House.Cotton, H.E.A., p. 109. The Circular Canal joins the Hooghly River at Chitpur. Early in the 20th century a large lock and tidal basin had been constructed, at the mouth of the canal. Entally, Manicktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, parts of Beniapukur, Ballygunge, Watgunge, Ekbalpur, Garden Reach and Tollygunj were added to Kolkata Municipal Corporation in 1888. Garden Reach was later taken out.Bagchi, Amiya Kumar, Wealth and Work in Calcutta, 1860-1921, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, p. 213. Chitpur Road Along that old road, popular as pilgrim's path, dharamshalas and shops came up. Habitations grew around them and localities developed. They were self- descriptive. The chicken (murgi) market (hat) was Murgihata, twin (jora) bridges (sanko) over a creek distinguished Jorasanko, butchers (kasais) slaughtered animals at Kasitola, and the potters (kumors) spun the river clay on wheels at Kumortuli. Later, they took to making clay idols in demand in the mansions that grew up all around. When the new Fort William was built in the 1750s at Gobindapur, the inhabitants of the disbanded village migrated northwards. Chitpur Road was Kolkata's oldest road. Apart from the aristocracy, there have been common folks engaged in various trades. The distinctive Bengali panjika almanac was printed here. It was a centre for Battala books. So many things on Chitpore Road have been an integral part of Bengal's life and culture ‚Äì the paan (betel leaf mouth refresher), the adda (stray gossiping), jatra shows and the brass band playing \\"He is a jolly good fellow\\" to enliven wedding receptions.Jatra 2 BBC News, 2005. A part of Lower Chitpur Road rivalled the Chandni Chowk of Delhi before construction of Nakhoda Mosque in 1926. The last vestiges of Nawabi style were found along Chitpur Road.Chakraborty, Manish and Hanig, Florian. Bialobrzeski, Peter.(Ed.) (2008) Calcutta - Chitpur Road Neighborhoods. Hatje Cantz. It was on this road that Raja Rammohun Roy built his Brahmo Sabha, which later became Adi Brahmo Samaj. The road was renamed Rabindra Sarani, after its most famous resident, Rabindranath Tagore. It is Kolkata's museum with communities and social groups from various parts of country and beyond finding a place in nooks along the road. Jorasanko Thakur Bari, the home of the Tagore family now houses Rabindra Bharati University. Corporation ward In 1876, the peripheral areas of Kolkata were brought under the umbrella of a single Suburban Municipality. In 1889, the suburban area was split into five units of which one was the Suburban Municipality of Kashipur and Chitpur. In 1931, it was merged with Kolkata.Chakraborty, Satyesh C., The Growth of Calcutta in the Twentieth Century, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol II, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 2, Oxford University Press, . Chitpur now forms ward no. 6 of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. With the Hooghly River on the west, it is surrounded by Cossipore, Bagbazar, Paikpara, Tala, Belgachia and Shyambazar on the other three sides.Detailed Maps of Kolkata, D.P.Publication & Sales Concern. Across the Hooghly River is Salkia in Howrah. Police district Chitpur police station is part of the North and North Suburban division of Kolkata Police.

Railway passenger terminal Chitpur is home to Kolkata railway station, the fourth and latest railway passenger terminal for the city. The first two stations, Howrah and Sealdah, were built more than a century ago and now both of them have reached the saturation point in capacity.Online version of Frontline magazine dated 3-16 Dec 2005 The third one, Shalimar, which is under jurisdiction of South Eastern Railway, is located in Howrah, far away from the city centre. The new terminal has been named \\"Kolkata\\". The decision to build a passenger terminal at Chitpur came after a lot of deliberations. Chitpur was finally approved by the Railway Ministry in 2003-04. Certain inherent advantages helped in the selection of this place. Other than being located in the heart of Kolkata, Chitpur has already functioned as an important rail yard for around a century. Transport Cossipore Road (Sri Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa Dev Sarani) is the artery of Chitpur. Buses ply along the road. The road is connected to B.T. Road (at Chunni Babu Bazar) with Lock Gate Road Overbridge. It is also connected to Bagbazar (Khirode Vidyavinode Avenue) with Chitpur Bridge over a canal.Google maps Chitpur Bridge was firstly inaugurated in 1937.

It lasted about two weeks. It was one of many similar uprisings in Japan around that time, occurring in reaction to the dramatic changes to society which came about in the wake of the 1868 Meiji Restoration.Bowman, Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture. p. 167 What set Chichibu apart was the scope of the uprising, and the severity of the government's response. Background After the end of the Tokugawa shogunate with the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Japanese agriculture was dominated by a tenant farming system. The Meiji government based its industrialization program on tax revenues from private land ownership, and the Land Tax Reform of 1873 increased the process of landlordism, with many farmers having their land confiscated due to inability to pay the new taxes. Rice planting in 1890s. This scene remained virtually unchanged until the 1970s in some parts of Japan This situation was worsened by the deflationary Matsukata Fiscal Policy from 1881, which severely depressed rice prices, leading to further bankruptcies. As tenants were forced to pay over half their crop as rent, they were often forced to send wives and daughters to textile mills or to sell daughters into prostitution to pay for taxes.Howell, Geographies of Identity in Nineteenth Century Japan. Pp.109 The rising discontent of the led to a number of peasant revolts in various impoverished rural areas around the country. The year 1884 saw roughly sixty riots; the total debt of the time of Japan's farmers is estimated to two hundred million yen, which corresponds to roughly two trillion yen in 1985 currency.Irokawa Daikichi, The Culture of the Meiji Period. Pp.155 A number of these uprisings were organized and led through the , a catch-all term for a number of disconnected meeting groups and societies throughout the country, consisting of citizens who sought more representation in government and basic rights. The national constitutions and other writings on freedom in the west were largely unknown among the Japanese masses at this time, but there were those in the movement who had studied the west and were able to conceive of democratic political ideology. Some societies within the movement wrote their own draft constitutions, and many saw their work as a form of . Songs and rumors among the rebels often indicated their belief that the would alleviate their problems. Uprising While many groups and political parties across the country debated political issues peacefully, the self-titled \\"Revolutionary Army\\" erupted in revolt on 31 October 1884, in the Chichibu district of Saitama Prefecture. The uprising was triggered by the refusal of creditors to allow a moratorium on repayment of loans. The insurgents sought to attack a government building and loan shark offices and to destroy records of their debts. Accounts of the size of the revolt varied widely, from 5,000 to over 10,000 men. Most of the rebels were armed with farming implements, bamboo spears, swords, wooden cannon, and hunting muskets. The rebels poured out of their small mountain villages, armed not only with weapons, but with banners and slogans; declaring \\"New Rule of Benevolence,\\" and labeling the seized district office as the \\"Headquarters of the Revolutionary Army.\\"Tierney, Kamikaze, Cherry Blossoms and Nationism. p. 81 Having established a headquarters, the ringleaders adopted a new calendar, and began to issue decrees, labeling all as being issued in \\"Year One of Freedom and Self-Government.\\" The revolutionaries also dispatched smaller groups to seek out and oust individual government officials in the neighboring villages before recalling their forces and marching toward Tokyo, where the movement first met with significant resistance.McCain. Japan:A Modern History. Pp.118 The revolutionaries were met by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police and the new professional Imperial Japanese Army heavily armed with the newly-engineered Murata rifle, and their advance ground to a halt under the overwhelming police and army firepower. Roughly ten days after the seizure of the district office, the Chichibu uprising was finally fully quashed at the foot of the Yatsugatake Mountains. The precise number of revolutionaries killed remains unknown. Many survivors were arrested, and nearly 3,000 were tried and convicted. Three hundred were convicted as felons, and the seven ringleaders were sentenced to death. Five of the seven were hanged less than three months later in February 1885. Although this was the largest popular uprising of the Meiji period, or perhaps because of it, the government sought to dismiss it by describing the rebels as little more than hooligans. Legacy Overall, the Chichibu Incident was caused by a combination of liberal, revolutionary ideologies and economic motivations. Though the traditional view of the event reduces the peasants' motivations to being purely economic, some scholars see it as part of a suppressed peoples' rights movement in this period. Irokawa Daikichi of Tokyo Keizai University, describes the incident in detail in his book, The Culture of the Meiji Period, and argues that it was not simply part of a yonaoshi movement, nor an ordinary uprising by poor peasants looking to absolve themselves of their debts. The leaders of the uprising, if not the majority of their followers, were active thinkers of the Freedom and People's Rights movements, and sought no less than to challenge the Meiji government itself. According to Irokawa, they were guided by \\"the revolutionary ideology of the Liberal Party; they had a revolutionary faith that they could 'reform the government, make freedom come to life, and join battle for the people.'\\" Though a monument to the fallen was erected several decades later, a great number of the ringleaders and others who escaped formal punishment have never had their names officially cleared. A film, , appeared in 2004, directed by Seijir≈ç K≈çyama, commemorating the incident's 120th anniversary. Notes References  * Irokawa, Daikichi (1985). The Culture of the Meiji Period.

It specializes in affordable systems and has a range of stereo and surround sound systems. During its ownership under McLaren Group it was named TAGMcLaren Audio.  History  Audiolab was founded by Philip Swift and Derek Scotland in 1983. They met as students of Imperial College, and shared a common frustration of the high cost of hi-fi equipment and the difficulty of use. The first product was the 8000A integrated amplifier, followed by the 8000C preamplifier, the 8000P power amplifier and 8000M mono-blocks. As the company grew, they developed new products including CD players, transports, radio tuners and digital-to-analog converters. Audiolab was taken over by TAG McLaren in 1998.http://www.stereophile.com/news/10060/ The TAG McLaren Audio enterprise suffered adversely from the economic slump in the early 2000s, and announced that it ceased development in mid-2003http://www.digitaltrends.com/home- theater/tag-mclaren-audio-ceases-development/ followed by a strategic review. The audio operations were eventually sold to the International Audio Group (headquartered in Shenzhen, China),http://stereophile.com/news/033104tag/ which owns other Hi-Fi manufacturers such as Quad, Mission, Wharfedale and Castle Acoustics. It wasn't until 2005 that Audiolab re-emerged under the leadership of designer Nick Clarke (no longer with Audiolab), with a whole new range of equipment. Audiolab has unveiled a range of audio components that have been badged the 8200 series, as opposed to the traditional 8000 series. In addition to adding a larger monoblock amplifier, the 8200MB, the new digital components also accept digital input from computers and other digital sources. The 8200CD is the first to be unveiled, followed by the 8200CDQ, which was also announced at the 2010 Hi-End Show in Munich, Germany. The new 8200 series digital products have been designed by John Westlake, aside from the 8200 AV. The newest 8300 series was introduced in 2015. Including the integrated amplifier 8300A, the CD player 8300CD, and the power amplifiers 8300MB and 8300XP Audiolab was sold as \\"Camtech\\" in the Germany and Netherlands.

She was the first female to ride in the Hong Kong Derby and was known as \\"Little Sister\\" due to her likable personality. Career Kan apprenticed with trainer Kan Ping Chee in 1997. On February 1, 1998, she got her inaugural win on Sir Galway (trained by Brian Kan) and on May 30, 1998, she won the Queen Mother's Cup in her first Trophy victory on Fat Choy Together (also trained by Brian Kan). Later that year, on June 23, she rode in Britain for trainer David Nicholls and got one win. She also won an apprentice race at Haydock in July on Nervous Rex. However, her mount that day crashed through the rail after the winning post, leaving Kan with concussion and an eye injury which eventually required surgery. The fall forced her to miss the first three months of the Hong Kong season. On March 3, 1999, Kan created history by becoming the first female to ride in the Hong Kong Derby. She rode Man of Honour, trained by I Allan. Her career ended less than a month later. Accident Kan's last race took place on a rainy day at the Sha Tin Racecourse in Hong Kong. It was the third race, run at a distance of 1400 meters for Class 5 horses. Kan was racing in midfield on Happy King (Êº¢Âª∑‰πãÂØ∂), trained by Alex Wong, when about halfway in the seven-furlong race, the seven-year-old clipped the heels of Big Fortune, causing her to fall in front of four horses. Two of these ‚Äì Solidarity and Lucky Afleet ‚Äì severely trampled her, kicking her in the chest and head. Kan was rushed to the Prince of Wales Hospital where she underwent emergency surgery for skull fractures and internal bleeding, but later died. The last race at the course was cancelled out of respect and the trophy awarded to the Champion Apprentice each season has now been renamed the \\"Willy Kan Memorial Cup\\" in her honor. French jockey Eric Saint-Martin complained about the state of the track, but racing continued after Jockey Club officials had spoken to official jockeys' representatives, Eric Legrix and Eddie Lai. Kan was the first jockey to die racing in Hong Kong since Brian Taylor in 1984. This was the second fatality at Sha Tin since the track opened in 1978 and only the third in Hong Kong. Kan's former trainer Brian Kan (no relation) did not take another apprentice after her death, but funded and built a memorial school in Mainland China in her name. Court case After her death, the insurers, Lloyds, launched a court case against her estate and the Hong Kong Jockey Club, relating to a feature race at Sha Tin on May 3, 1998 where a horse, Harbour Master, suffered a severed tendon in its left foreleg. The insurers claimed that Harbour Master was injured due to interference on the track created by Kan, who rode Winning Scene (and, in fact, Kan was suspended from riding for five days after the race due to her reckless riding). According to the insurers, this interference caused a domino effect leading to Celestial Fortune's leg clipping Harbor Master's foreleg. Lloyd's was seeking to recoup Ff3.5 million (pounds 325,000) in insurance paid out after Harbour Master, owned by Hong Kong business tycoon Dickson Poon, had to be put down following the accident. This case marked the first time that a racing authority and jockey was seen as potentially responsible to the owner of the injured horse, as opposed to another jockey. Poon himself issued a statement to stress that the court action was not instigated by him, while Joseph Fox, counsel for the HKJC and the estate of Kan, said the law had never been tested on this point and it could expose jockeys to lawsuits every time they rode a race. The case was heard by Mr. Justice William Stone, who eventually dismissed the case.

Biography Beckford was born to Jamaican parents in Northampton, in the East Midlands of England, and was raised in a Pentecostal church.Liz Ford, \\"Robert Beckford: A voice in the crowd\\" , The Guardian, 17 May 2005. He states that his \\"white, middle-class\\" religious education teacher \\"turned me on in a big way to RE and sowed the seeds to think about religion and culture\\", while his maths tutor introduced him to politics and the work of Malcolm X, who is still a hero. After taking A levels, Beckford studied religion and sociology at Houghton College, New York. He then studied at the London Bible College, Middlesex. After a year in the community, Beckford studied for his PhD while also working part-time at The Queen's Foundation, Birmingham, where he became Britain's first tutor in black theology. Professionally, Beckford has spent his career in academia, beginning in 1999 as a research fellow at Birmingham University, then becoming a lecturer in African Diasporan Religions & Cultures. For two years he was Reader in Black Theology and Popular Culture at Oxford Brookes University and then a visiting Professor of Sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London.About Dr. Robert Beckford , official website Since October 2019, Beckford has been Professor of Black Theology at The Queen's Foundation, having rejoined the institution from Canterbury Christ Church University, where he was Professor of Theology and Culture in the African Diaspora. In 2006/7 he presented shows on BBC Radio WM, first the African-Caribbean programme and then the Sunday Breakfast Show, a blend of news, interviews and chat about religious and ethical issues.WM Presenters > Robert Beckford at BBC Birmingham. Documentaries God is Black In 2004, Beckford presented a documentary called God is Black, which broadcast on Channel 4, which compared white and black people's interpretation of Christianity. It was strongly criticized by conservative Evangelicals in the Anglican Church who accused it of \\"racialising\\" religious issues. Who Wrote the Bible? In 2004, Beckford hosted a documentary called Who Wrote the Bible? broadcast on Channel 4 on Christmas Day. Beckford challenges the long-standing belief by many Christians that the Bible is the pure unadulterated word of God untouched by human hand. He seeks to demonstrate that the Bible's history involves multiple revisions, exclusions and is the result of a number of different authors. Ghetto Britain In 2006, Beckford made the film Ghetto Britain for the television station More 4. Through the course of the documentary, he composes a manifesto of change that he plans to put before the Commission for Racial Equality. Beckford has also made films for the BBC analysing religion and Britain's colonial history, focusing on the role of Britain's African Caribbean community.Robert Beckford, \\"Colonial history is British history at BBC\\" , BBC News, 3 August, 2002. The Passion: Films, Faith and Fury On 15 April 2006, Beckford hosted his second one-off documentary, called The Passion: Films, Faith and Fury on Channel 4. This was Beckford's exploration of the history and the increasingly uneasy relationship between religion and the film industry, as well as the controversy that often arises as a result of any major religiously-themed film being released. The Secret Family of Jesus Beckford hosted a documentary called The Secret Family of Jesus on Channel 4 on Christmas Day 2006. In this documentary he explores the history and legacy of Jesus' family and presents historical evidence of Jesus' familial relationship to John the Baptist; his family unit consisting of four brothers and (at least) two sisters; his relationship with Mary Magdalene; and of Jesus' ministry being passed to his eldest brother James for the approximately 30 years prior to the destruction of the second temple and the subsequent diaspora. The Hidden Story of Jesus On 2007 Christmas Day, Beckford's documentary The Hidden Story of Jesus premiered on Channel 4. It investigates the parallels between Christianity and other religions, some of which predate it. The Secrets of the Twelve Disciples In The Secrets of the Twelve Disciples, broadcast in Easter 2008, Beckford explored Paul the Apostle's role in founding the Church and his relationship with Jesus' family; the Roman Catholic Church's claim to Saint Peter; Thomas the Apostle's travels to India; James, son of Zebedee as a patron saint of Spain; the demonisation of Judas Iscariot; and female Apostles. The Nativity Decoded On 2008 Christmas Day, Beckford's documentary The Nativity Decoded premiered on Channel 4. It provides an in- depth look at the nativity story, its traditions, history and meaning. The Battle For Christianity In 2016 he presented a programme on The Battle For Christianity. This programme explored the various ways used to help people accept Christianity including the evangelising of immigrants to the country. Jamaican Bible Remixed His 2017 radio programme, Jamaican Bible Remixed, about the Patois version of the Bible, was broadcast on BBC World Service, marking Jamaican Independence Day.

Mainstream DBMS software such as Oracle, IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server need ongoing management. As such, corporations that use DBMS software often hire specialized information technology personnel called database administrators or DBAs. Responsibilities * Installation, configuration and upgrading of Database server software and related products. * Evaluate Database features and Database related products. * Establish and maintain sound backup and recovery policies and procedures. * Take care of the Database design and implementation. * Implement and maintain database security (create and maintain users and roles, assign privileges). * Database tuning and performance monitoring. * Application tuning and performance monitoring. * Setup and maintain documentation and standards. * Plan growth and changes (capacity planning). * Work as part of a team and provide 24x7 support when required. * Do general technical troubleshooting and give cons. * Database recovery.  Types  There are three types of DBAs: #Systems DBAs (also referred to as physical DBAs, operations DBAs or production Support DBAs): focus on the physical aspects of database administration such as DBMS installation, configuration, patching, upgrades, backups, restores, refreshes, performance optimization, maintenance and disaster recovery. #Development DBAs: focus on the logical and development aspects of database administration such as data model design and maintenance, DDL (data definition language) generation, SQL writing and tuning, coding stored procedures, collaborating with developers to help choose the most appropriate DBMS feature/functionality and other pre-production activities. #Application DBAs: usually found in organizations that have purchased 3rd party application software such as ERP (enterprise resource planning) and CRM (customer relationship management) systems. Examples of such application software includes Oracle Applications, Siebel and PeopleSoft (both now part of Oracle Corp.) and SAP. Application DBAs straddle the fence between the DBMS and the application software and are responsible for ensuring that the application is fully optimized for the database and vice versa. They usually manage all the application components that interact with the database and carry out activities such as application installation and patching, application upgrades, database cloning, building and running data cleanup routines, data load process management, etc. While individuals usually specialize in one type of database administration, in smaller organizations, it is not uncommon to find a single individual or group performing more than one type of database administration.  Automation of database administration  The degree to which the administration of a database is automated dictates the skills and personnel required to manage databases. On one end of the spectrum, a system with minimal automation will require significant experienced resources to manage; perhaps 5-10 databases per DBA. Alternatively an organization might choose to automate a significant amount of the work that could be done manually therefore reducing the skills required to perform tasks. As automation increases, the personnel needs of the organization splits into highly skilled workers to create and manage the automation and a group of lower skilled \\"line\\" DBAs who simply execute the automation. Database administration work is complex, repetitive, time- consuming and requires significant training. Since databases hold valuable and mission-critical data, companies usually look for candidates with multiple years of experience. Database administration often requires DBAs to put in work during off-hours (for example, for planned after hours downtime, in the event of a database-related outage or if performance has been severely degraded). DBAs are commonly well compensated for the long hours. One key skill required and often overlooked when selecting a DBA is database recovery (a part of disaster recovery). It is not a case of ‚Äúif‚Äù but a case of ‚Äúwhen‚Äù a database suffers a failure, ranging from a simple failure to a full catastrophic failure. The failure may be data corruption, media failure, or user induced errors. In either situation the DBA must have the skills to recover the database to a given point in time to prevent a loss of data.  Database administration tools  Often, the DBMS software comes with certain tools to help DBAs manage the DBMS. Such tools are called native tools. For example, Microsoft SQL Server comes with SQL Server Management Studio and Oracle has tools such as SQL*Plus and Oracle Enterprise Manager/Grid Control. In addition, 3rd parties such as BMC, Quest Software, Embarcadero Technologies, patchVantage and SQL Maestro Group offer GUI tools to monitor the DBMS and help DBAs carry out certain functions inside the database more easily. Another kind of database software exists to manage the provisioning of new databases and the management of existing databases and their related resources. The process of creating a new database can consist of hundreds or thousands of unique steps from satisfying prerequisites to configuring backups where each step must be successful before the next can start. A human cannot be expected to complete this procedure in the same exact way time after time - exactly the goal when multiple databases exist. As the number of DBAs grows, without automation the number of unique configurations frequently grows to be costly/difficult to support. All of these complicated procedures can be modeled by the best DBAs into database automation software and executed by the standard DBAs. Software has been created specifically to improve the reliability and repeatability of these procedures such as Stratavia's Data Palette and GridApp Systems Clarity.  The impact of IT and cloud automation  Automated Database operations has grown since 2009, following Amazon Web Services introduction of AWS RDS, providing automated and managed database as a service. Microsoft Azure launched a similar automated database as a service in 2010, with SQL Azure, providing automated backups, with geo-replication and high availability. The introduction of docker (software) containers has enhanced support for fast delivery of containerized database instances, and both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure have enhanced automated support for containers in their respective services. Third party support for database container images has grown, including MongoDB, Postgres, MySQL from Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server from Microsoft, and from independent port's of docker (software) from Windocks Newer technologies such as Stratavia's Data Palette suite and GridApp Systems Clarity have begun to increase the automation of databases causing the reduction of database related tasks. However at best this only reduces the amount of mundane, repetitive activities and does not eliminate the need for DBAs. The intention of DBA automation is to enable DBAs to focus on more proactive activities around database architecture, deployment, performance and service level management. Every database requires a database owner account that can perform all schema management operations. This account is specific to the database and cannot log into Data Director. You can add database owner accounts after database creation. Data Director users must log in with their database-specific credentials to view the database, its entities, and its data or to perform database management tasks. Database administrators and application developers can manage databases only if they have appropriate permissions and roles granted to them by the organization administrator. The permissions and roles must be granted on the database group or on the database, and they only apply within the organization in which they are granted.  Learning database administration  There are several education institutes that offer professional courses, including late- night programs, to allow candidates to learn database administration. Also, DBMS vendors such as Oracle, Microsoft and IBM offer certification programs to help companies to hire qualified DBA practitioners. College degree in Computer Science or related field is helpful but not necessarily a prerequisite.

It is the second-largest surviving marsupial carnivore of New Guinea. Names It is known as suatg in the Kalam language of Papua New Guinea.Pawley, Andrew and Ralph Bulmer. 2011. A Dictionary of Kalam with Ethnographic Notes. Canberra. Pacific Linguistics.  Taxonomy  The New Guinean quoll belongs to Dasyuridae, a family of carnivorous marsupials, which includes other species of quolls, the extinct thylacine, the Tasmanian devil, and many smaller carnivores. It is one of six extant species of quolls, four of which are found in only in Australia and two of which are restricted to New Guinea (the bronze quoll is the other New Guinean species). Both the quolls found in New Guinea seem to be most closely related to the Australian western quoll. Description The New Guinean quoll is small, usually weighing just over 1 lb (0.45 kg). Its body is brown and the back spotted with white; the spots do not extend onto the lightly haired tail. It resembles a cat-like opossum; the quolls are also referred to as \\"native cats\\" and occasionally \\"marsupial cats\\" or \\"tiger cats\\". Its feet have transversely striated pads, which is likely to be an adaptation for grip and is indicative of a life spent in the trees. It lives throughout the forests of New Guinea at elevations up to 11,000 ft (3300 m) but usually closer to 3,000 ft (900 m). The population appears to be centered in the highlands of New Guinea. Behaviour and diet Quolls feed on a large range of prey, including birds, rats, other marsupials, small reptiles, and insects. They are reported to feed on prey larger than themselves. They are good climbers, but also spend time on the forest floor. Although nocturnal, they spend the daylight hours basking in the sun. They nest in rocky banks, hollow logs, or small caves. In captivity, the longest recorded survival is three years, but their lifespan in the wild is unknown. Threats The number of New Guinean quolls is believed to be decreasing as a result of human encroachment into their habitat and the associated loss of cover. Because they are known to scavenge, persecution by humans may be putting pressure on the population. They also face predation and competition from introduced species such as dogs and cats. Another threat, though less severe than with the four Australian species of Dasyurus, is poisoning by bufotoxins from the introduced cane toad (Rhinella marina, formerly Bufo marinus).Government of Queensland (2009); Invasive Animal Risk Assessment: Cane toad (Bufo marinus) Because they have evolved consistently isolated from toads since the Jurassic, all dasyurids possess extremely low resistance to toad toxins,Covacevich, Jeanette, and Archer, Mike; ‚ÄòThe distribution of the cane toad, Bufo marinus in Australia and its effects on indigenous vertebrates‚Äô; Memoirs of the Queensland Museum, volume 17 (1975), pp. 305‚Äì310. and whilst smaller dasyurids usually do develop conditioned taste aversion to toads,Webb, Jonathan K.; Pearson, David and Shine, Richard; ‚ÄòA small dasyurid predator (Sminthopsis virginiae) rapidly learns to avoid a toxic invader‚Äô; Wildlife Research, issue 38 (2011), pp. 726‚Äì731 there is little evidence for this in quolls.

The School opened in 1987 and was initially based in Palmdale, California before moving to a property in the Gila Wilderness, New Mexico. It was eventually closed in 2002 and its certificate of incorporation was revoked. The school‚Äôs curriculum focused heavily on the teachings of Scientology. Students were subjected to pseudo- scientific processes such as the Purification Rundown and daily auditing. A large portion of each day was dedicated to cleaning and general manual labor. The school received criticism over the years for the treatment of students under its care. Students have reported cases of being underfed as well as being beaten, whipped and publicly humiliated as forms of punishment. History The Mace-Kingsley Ranch School opened in 1987 in Palmdale, California by Scientologists Debra Mace and Carol Kingsley. The school stated that its purpose was to help kids in trouble by creating a safe environment for them away from the influences that were causing them problems. In the early 1990s, the school moved from its Palmdale location to a ranch in the Gila Wilderness, New Mexico. The school was located approximately 9 miles north-east from the town of Reserve on New Mexico State Road 12. The ranch was situated on 158 acres of land comprising two main areas, the upper ranch and the lower ranch. Attached to this was another 14,120 acres leased from the US Forest Service. The school was coeducational and was responsible for children as young as 8 years old. The boys dormitories were located at the lower ranch where most of the daily activities took place and the girls dormitories were at the upper ranch, around 2 miles away. The school was eventually shut down in 2002 and its certificate of incorporation was revoked. After the school closed, the property was re-branded as the Hacienda del Espirito and was advertised for sale in 2003 at $1,700,000, later that year the sale price was raised to $2,000,000 before eventually being reduced to $1,499,000 in 2005. Scientology methodology An E-Meter L. Ron Hubbard conducting Dianetics seminar in Los Angeles in 1950The school utilized the \\"Study Technology\\" methodology developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. A copyright notice on the school's website gave \\"grateful acknowledgement\\" to the L. Ron Hubbard library for usage of works of the Scientology founder. The website also acknowledged that the school was \\"licensed\\" to use educational methodology from Applied Scholastics, a \\"service mark\\" owned by Association for Better Living and Education. The school's website also noted that terms including Dianetics, Scientology, Purification Rundown, and Oxford Capacity Analysis \\"are trademarks and service marks\\" of the Religious Technology Center. The school was endorsed by actress and Scientologist Kelly Preston. Lon Woodbury of Woodbury Reports visited the school site in 2000, and evaluated it on his website in 2001. He noted that many of the classes were based on techniques developed by L. Ron Hubbard, and commented: \\"For a parent considering Mace-Kingsley Ranch School for their child, I would recommend obtaining at least a basic knowledge of Scientology. Since that is so central to the school‚Äôs program, it would be vital for the parents to be comfortable with its major tenets.\\" Upon arrival at the school students were first administered an IQ test before being subjected to the Purification Rundown. Students were then given the Oxford Capacity Analysis, a pseudo-scientific Scientology personality test originally designed in the early 1950s. In order to graduate from the program, students were required to complete The 10 requirements which included steps such as \\"orientation and willingness\\", \\"changing past patterns\\" and \\"demonstrating lessons learned\\". Daily auditing using E-Meters was also required of students. Mace-Kingsley Family Center Some time after opening the Mace-Kingsley Ranch School, Debra Mace and Carol Kingsley opened the Mace-Kingsley Family Center in Clearwater, Florida. The family center caters to Scientologist families and runs a number of programs for children based on the writings of L. Ron Hubbard. These programs include auditing, the purification rundown and ethics handling. Scientologists can bring their young children, even infants to be audited at the center. Criticism Rolling Stone Magazine Rolling Stone magazine investigated the school before its closure. The article by Janet Reitman, \\"Inside Scientology\\", was critical of the school's practices. Reitman noted, \\"The school enforced a rigid Scientology focus that many former students now say served as both a mechanism of control and a form of religious indoctrination\\". This Rolling Stone article was selected for inclusion in The Best American Magazine Writing 2007, published by Columbia University Press. Phoenix New Times In an interview in 2009 with the Phoenix New Times regarding his time at the school, Charlie Brand of the Miniature Tigers said, \\"It was bizarre because my family's not Scientologists. My parents thought it was for troubled teens. [The camp] forced Scientology on you, and you had to go through the steps before you could leave. You had to use an E-Meter and study guides about all their beliefs. I fought it for a while but eventually was like, 'Yeah, this Scientology stuff is great,' and faked it\\". Leah Remini: Scientology and the aftermath The A&E; program Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath aired an episode entirely dedicated to the ranch entitled \\"The Ranches\\". In the episode, former students, Tara Reile and Nathan Rich made multiple accusations of child abuse and neglect. Audio of Wally Hanks recorded in or around Sep. 1988 at the Mace/Kingsley ranch school on W. Ave R8 in Palmdale, CaliforniaThe show also features an audio recording of Hanks repeatedly whipping a child with a belt while yelling at him to \\"look at that picture of LRH (L Ron Hubbard).\\" After his death in 2017, Wally Hanks‚Äô nephew, Brian Hanks was interviewed by Tony Ortega of The Underground Bunker. In the interview it was noted that Wally Hanks still kept the paddle he used on students at the ranch mounted on his wall. Just before the episode on the ranch went to air the Church of Scientology released their own short documentaries on both Rich and Reile.

Common examples include: * differing levels of participation in democratic, electoral politics, by social class, race, gender, etc. * differing levels of participation in online communities as described by Jakob Nielsen. In politics, participation inequality typically affects \\"the kinds of individuals, such as the young, the poor and those with little formal education\\" who tend to not take the initiative to participate in electoral and related events. State enumeration, such as was done in Canada before the implementation of the National Register of Electors in 1996, \\"worked to augment voter turnout among all segments of society and thus mitigated a natural tendency toward participation inequality in electoral politics\\".  Political participation inequality  Political participation inequality refers to how populations differ in political participation when sorted by various characteristics. Most often these groupings are by social class, race, gender, or ethnicity. Widespread political participation inequality often describes when various groups are left out of the political sphere or excluded from various political rights. Participation inequality usually helps political theorists determine where democracies fail or when political institutions are not democratically responsive. When political systems are too unequal in terms of political participation, it most generally means that there is a breakdown in the ability of all citizens to politically deliberate to distribute various scarce resources, implement comprehensive public policy, or enact needed social reforms. Nations with high amounts of participation inequality are generally characterized as undemocratic although there are certain nations, like India, where low participation inequality has not helped the democratic responsiveness of Indian institutions.  Robert Dahl  Robert Dahl's two dimensions for evaluating democracies/polarchies In his 1971 paper Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition, Robert Dahl provided a basic framework to evaluate democracies or polyarchies (nearly/almost full democracies) based on their participation inequality. He argued that there are two dimensions: public contestation ‚Äì the various rights and procedures guaranteed to citizens ‚Äì and inclusiveness ‚Äì how accessible these rights are to all citizens. More fully, public contestation describes the necessary functions for a liberal democracy: a competitive political atmosphere, ability to run for office, right to vote, right to assembly, etc. Inclusiveness describes what portion of the population is able to enjoy these rights and procedures. Participation inequality is usually represented along the dimension of inclusiveness. So, if a nation were to allow only short people to vote, this political system would have a certain level of public contestation ‚Äì the right to vote being available ‚Äì and a certain dimension of inclusiveness ‚Äì only short people being able to enjoy this right. This system of evaluating democracies enables comparisons of political regimes based on participation inequality by comparing inclusiveness between equally publicly contestable political systems.  Causes of political participation   Dahlian causes  Using Dahl‚Äôs framework, the first cause of participation inequality can be rooted in a political system‚Äôs public policy or in the Dahlian dimension of inclusiveness. Policies that exclude groups based on ethnic identity such as old apartheid South Africa or Iranian exclusion of Sunni political parties best conveys systemic political exclusion that is rooted in a regime‚Äôs citizenship requirements or public policy.  Expansion of Dahl  An expansion on Robert Dahl's two dimensions by adding a possible third dimension: institutions The more insidious cause of participation inequality stems from a third dimension that has been recently added to Dahl‚Äôs two-dimensional evaluation of political systems: institutions. In this framework, institutions implement political rights and procedures guaranteed by the state. Institutional causes for participation inequality can include literacy tests, extensive citizenship requirements, sparse voting booths in rural or poor areas, and a lack of public transportation. These all affect the ability of citizens to properly exercise guaranteed rights like voting. Institutional causes of participation inequality can also be mitigated or exacerbated by cultural norms. Most often high voter turnout usually is hailed as a marker for a democratically responsive nation; however, in India ‚Äúthe turnout rate among the poor is almost as high as for those who are either middle class or rich. A detailed study of voter participation reported for the 2009 national elections shows that voter participation rates do not seem to vary by income status at all...Recent studies report similar findings from Africa and Latin America (Bratton 2008; Boot & Seligson 2008)‚Äù. Many of these studies conclude that in developing democracies voting acts as a reassurance of social status or worth in the eyes of the state. This cultural norm has not translated to more democratically responsive institutions in that ‚Äúthe governments created by these elections are known to neglect the interests of the poor and treat them disrespectfully compared to other income groups‚Äù. Nations like India are considered to be exceptions to the general rule that economic status has some bearing on voter participation.  Economic and educational inequality  Economic inequality and educational inequality have often been pointed to as common culprits for political participation inequality. In large part, these two types of inequality are often created and reiterated by political institutions, but most political theorists differentiate these causes for political participation as separate, largely because they are not fully solved by changes in political institutions. While the outcomes of political institutions highly vary from regime to regime, most of the literature finds that high amounts of economic inequality in developed countries depress voter turnout for poorer individuals and increase voter turnout for more affluent individuals (this depends on social cohesion of societies, correlating negatively with affluent political participation when economic inequality is high). Other literature finds that educational inequality depresses voter turnout depending on one‚Äôs income level and perceived relative educational status (how one perceives one‚Äôs social status and others‚Äô education levels).

Named for the presence of crayfish, it is one of the few perennial streams in the Columbia Basin of central Washington, flowing from the northeastern Columbia River Plateau, roughly east of Reardan, west-southwest to empty into the Columbia River near the small town of Beverly. Its course exhibits many examples of the erosive powers of extremely large glacial Missoula Floods of the late Pleistocene, which scoured the region. In addition, Crab Creek and its region have been transformed by the large-scale irrigation of the Bureau of Reclamation's Columbia Basin Project (CBP), which has raised water table levels, significantly extending the length of Crab Creek and created new lakes and streams. Crab Subbasin Plan , Northwest Power and Conservation Council Crab Creek is long and drains a watershed in eastern Washington of . It is sometimes referred to as the \\"longest ephemeral stream in North America\\". Course Crab Creek is sometimes separated into Upper Crab Creek, which runs from the creek's source to Potholes Reservoir, and Lower Crab Creek, which runs from Potholes Reservoir to the Columbia River. Sometimes the stream is divided into three parts--Upper Crab Creek, from its source to Brook Lake, Middle Crab Creek, from Brook Lake to and including Potholes Reservoir; and Lower Crab Creek, from below Potholes Reservoir to the Columbia River. Upper Crab Creek was dry before the CBP and remains intermittent today. From its source near Reardan it flows generally southwest then west, collecting tributaries including Rock Creek, Coal Creek, Duck Creek, Canniwai Creek, and Wilson Creek. It empties into Brook Lake, located just south of Billy Clapp Lake, an equalizing reservoir of the CBP created by Pinto Dam. Crab Creek turns southward after Brook Lake. The CBP's East Low Canal, one of the projects main irrigation canals, crosses but does not mix waters with Crab Creek. At the city of Moses Lake Crab Creek empties into the Parker Horn arm of Moses Lake. Just before reaching the lake Crab Creek receives the waters of Rocky Coulee Wasteway, a mix of the intermittent Rocky Coulee Creek and irrigation runoff from the East Low Canal. Before the CBP there was no perennial flow between Brook Lake and Moses Lake. Only during periods of high water did Crab Creek flow through this area. Moses Lake empties into Potholes Reservoir, which feeds irrigation canals to the south. Below O'Sullivan Dam several springs renew Crab Creek, which flows southwest, then west. Below the community of Smyrna, Crab Creek meanders across a two mile-wide canyon, bounded on the south by Saddle Mountains and on the north by the Royal Slope and containing portions of the Columbia National Wildlife Refuge, before emptying into the Columbia River. Lakes Before 1904, drifting sand dunes blocked Crab Creek below Moses Lake, the largest natural lake on the creek. The creek's water did not reach the Columbia River. A large flood in 1904 washed through the dunes, lowering the lake by eight feet. Before the 1904 flood Crab Creek and Moses Lake's connection to the Columbia was intermittent. Fish native to Moses Lake indicate some periods of connection before 1904. It is possible that sand dunes created Moses Lake by blocking Crab Creek. The Columbia Basin Project in central Washington changed the character of Crab Creek substantially. The Crab Creek irrigation-return drainage basin covers an irrigated area of 296 mi¬≤ (767 km¬≤). A large earthfill dam, the O'Sullivan Dam (also referred to as the Potholes Dam) was constructed from 1947 to 1949, forming Potholes Reservoir, which serves as a central point in the CBP for storage of irrigation water, natural runoff, and irrigation-return flow, allowing irrigation water reuse throughout the southern CBP area. Potholes Reservoir releases water through canals and has no perennial outlet to Lower Crab Creek. Hence today the water in Lower Crab Creek comes from ground-water seepage from Potholes Reservoir and irrigation, from the Goose Lake Wasteway, and from tributary inflows downstream of the O'Sullivan Dam.Columbia Basin Project , Bureau of Reclamation History Program Research on Historic Reclamation Projects The water table in this section is variable but generally high due to the low elevation and irrigation runoff. Many lakes, including Merry, Lenice and Nunally Lakes, drain into Crab Creek. History Lower Crab Creek above the confluence with the Columbia River looking east. Saddle Mountains to the right. Since it is one of the few creeks in the region with reliable water, Spokane and Palouse Indians utilized the area along Crab Creek to gather roots and other food. A main Indian trail through the region followed the creek. Lt. Symons came past the mid-Crab Creek area while laying out the Military Wagon Road from Fort Walla Walla to Camp Chelan in 1879. The Old Wagon Road was established along the creek from Waterville, Washington to Ritzville, Washington in 1888. Washington history Prior to establishing irrigation, most of the areas along Upper Crab Creek were bunchgrass prairie, which was suited to range cattle and sheep. Crab Creek and tributary creeks provided water for the herds. Although a handful of ranchers ran herds, shipping their bunchgrass-fed beef to Montana by rail from towns like Sprague, settlement remained extremely sparse. One such example was George Lucas, an Irish emigrant, who was Adams County's first permanent white settler. He established a way-station and raised cattle and horses at Cow Creek along the road to Fort Colville in 1869.Adams County -- Thumbnail History Lower Crab Creek provided the only available water in that shrub-steppe region and so became the nucleus of settlement. Ben and Sam Hutchinson built the first recorded cabin along Lower Crab Creek in 1884. Tom McManamon, a cattle rancher, arrived shortly thereafter, with the first homesteaders arriving in 1901 and the town of Othello being established in 1904. When the Bureau of Reclamation located district offices in Othello in 1947 and built the Columbia Irrigation Project, the nature of the until then sparsely populated country changed dramatically. Geologic history Oversized Crab Creek Coulee showing basalt on far side. Creek on far side of valley. The Okanogan lobe of the Cordilleran Glacier moved down the Okanogan River valley and blocked the ancient route of the Columbia River, backing up water to create Lake Spokane. As the Okanogan lobe grew the Columbia was rerouted into the Grand Coulee. Flowing across the current Grand Coulee-Dry Falls region, the ice-age Columbia then entered the Quincy Basin near Quincy, Washington & joined Crab Creek at Moses Lake, following Crab Creek's course southward past the Frenchman Hills and turning west to run along the north face of the Saddle Mountains, there to rejoin the previous and modern course of the Columbia River just above the main water gap in the Saddle Mountains, Sentinel Gap. During this period the Missoula Floods periodically discharged large volumes of water, some of which reached Upper Crab Creek by overtopping the divide between the Columbia drainage and the Crab Creek drainage, and some diverted into the Columbia River to enter Crab Creek at Moses Lake. As a result, substantial coulees and scablands were created in the Upper Crab Creek drainage, and the drainage below the Potholes Reservoir is overlarge (i.e., the channel sizes could contain a substantially larger river than currently flows there). Recreation Crab Creek in the Drumheller Channels. Potholes State Park is a park on the shore of the Potholes Reservoir. It provides ready access to the Drumheller Channels National Natural Landmark which lies just downstream of the O'Sullivan Dam. This National Natural Landmark is an extensively eroded channeled scablands landscape, characterized by hundreds of isolated, steep- sided hills (buttes) surrounded by a braided network of numerous channels. All but the channel through which Crab Creek flows are currently dry. It is a classic example of the tremendous erosive powers of extremely large floods such as those that reformed the Columbia Plateau volcanic terrain during the late Pleistocene glacial Missoula Floods.J Harlen Bretz, (1923), The Channeled Scabland of the Columbia Plateau.

He came to prominence in the mid-1970s as the bass guitarist for rock band Blondie. Since the 1990s, Lachman has written full-time, often about mysticism and occultism. Biography Musical career Lachman joined Blondie in spring 1975 after original bassist Fred Smith left to join the band Television (following Richard Hell's departure). He wrote the music to the band's first single, \\"X-Offender\\", and popularized the band's sixties-retro look. In 1977 he left the group to form his own band and was replaced by Nigel Harrison, just as Blondie were starting to gain recognition. His song \\"(I'm Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear\\" was a UK top ten hit in 1978, and was subsequently recorded by Tracey Ullman and Annie Lennox. After Blondie, Lachman moved to L.A. and in 1978 released a single, \\"The First One/Tomorrow Belongs to You\\" on Beat Records. Shortly after this he formed The Know, with Joel Turrisi and Richard d'Andrea who were the first band to play the infamous Madame Wong's Chinese restaurant-turned-new wave venue. (Lachman's claim to this distinction has been verified by several eyewitnesses.) After a year and a half Joel left the band and was replaced by drummer John McGarvey.New York Rocker My Life in the Blank Generation by Gary Valentine pg 217 In 1980 The Know released a single \\"I Like Girls/Dreams\\" on Planet Records and were the only bi-coastal US \\"power pop\\" band, developing large followings in New York and Los Angeles. Failing to secure an album deal, he disbanded The Know and in 1981 played guitar with Iggy Pop. In 1996, after moving to London, he was asked to participate in the Blondie re-union, and in November of that year he recorded one of his songs, \\"Amor Fati\\", with Blondie, for their 'comeback' album. In 1997 he performed with Blondie at several major festival concerts in the US. Back in London Lachman worked with former X-Ray Spex saxophonist Lora Logic. In 1998 he formed Fire Escape together with violinist Ruth Vaughn and performed songs he had written for the Blondie reunion album (they had not been used due to the band ultimately excluding him from the recording process and the reunion tour). They released an EP to little fanfare and went on a permanent hiatus after two years. A compilation of Lachman's work in music entitled Tomorrow Belongs to You featuring recordings by The Know and Fire Escape, was released in 2003 on the UK label Overground Records. In 2006, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, because of his time with Blondie, although vocalist Harry prohibited ex- members from performing with the current line-up at the ceremony. Literary career Lachman moved to London in 1996 and became a full-time writer, contributing to The Guardian, Mojo, Times Literary Supplement and other journals. His first book, Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius, appeared in 2001. It was followed in 2002 by New York Rocker: My Life in The Blank Generation, an account of his years on the New York (CBGB) and Los Angeles music scene in the 1970s. In 2003 he produced A Secret History of Consciousness, a study of non-reductive, non-materialist accounts of consciousness, with detailed discussions of Owen Barfield, Julian Jaynes, Jean Gebser, Jurij Moskvitin, hypnagogia, and related themes. The Dedalus Book of the Occult: A Dark Muse (2004) charted the influence of the occult on western literature since the Enlightenment. The following years saw several more books, on the related themes of consciousness, the counter culture, and the influence of the occult and esoteric thought on mainstream western culture, including biographies of the Russian philosopher P.D. Ouspensky (2004), the Austrian \\"spiritual scientist\\" Rudolf Steiner (2007), the Swedish religious thinker Emanuel Swedenborg (2006), the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung (2010) and Colin Wilson (2016). Recent works include a study of writers and suicide, The Dedalus Book of Literary Suicides: Dead Letters (2008), with essays on Walter Benjamin, Yukio Mishima, Hermann Hesse, and others, and a history of occultism and politics, Politics and the Occult: The Right, the Left, and the Radically Unseen (2008), which addresses the theme of fascism and the occult through the work of Julius Evola, Rene Schwaller de Lubicz, Mircea Eliade, and others. He is a regular contributor to the Independent on Sunday, Fortean Times, and other journals in the US and UK, lectures frequently and occasionally broadcasts on the BBC. His work has been compared to Colin Wilson, and has been translated into German, Finnish, Czech, Russian, French, Dutch, Spanish, Norwegian, Italian and Portuguese. In 2014 Lachman took part in the annual Engelsberg Seminar held in Avesta, Sweden, lecturing on gnosis and the evolution of consciousness in the 21st century. In 2015 Lachman lectured on \\"Rejected Knowledge\\" to the Marion Institute as part of their \\"Living in the Real World\\" seminar. Recent years have seen Lachman lecturing on a variety of esoteric and cultural topics in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, France, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and the United States.

Maitland began his career as a Reserve pilot in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I and rose to brigadier general in the Michigan Air National Guard following World War II. In 1927 Maitland and Lt. Albert F. Hegenberger completed the first transpacific flight from California to Hawaii, flying the modified transport Bird of Paradise. Although the recognition accorded them was less in comparison with the adulation given Charles Lindbergh for his transatlantic flight only five weeks earlier, Maitland and Hegenberger's feat was arguably more significant from a navigational stand point. Maitland continued his career in the Air Corps, serving in combat as a bombardment group commander during World War II. He later became the first director of the Wisconsin Aeronautics Commission and the Director of Civil Defense for the state of Michigan before changing professions and becoming an Episcopal minister. Early history and World War I Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1899, Maitland graduated from Riverside High School in 1917. He enlisted as an aviation cadet in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps three days after the United States entered World War I and was assigned to training at a School of Military Aeronautics on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin, Texas in the fall of 1917. His flight training took place at Rich Field in Waco, Texas, after which he received a rating of Reserve Military Aviator and was commissioned on May 25, 1918 as a 2nd lieutenant in the Air Service, National Army at the age of nineteen. After a stint as a flying instructor, he was sent to gunnery school at Taliaferro Field, Texas, but the war ended before he could be sent overseas. Between wars Following World War I, Maitland was assigned to McCook Field in Ohio from November 1918 to April 1919 as a pilot with the Testing Squadron. Maitland was transferred to Luke Field, Hawaii, and assigned to the 6th Aero Squadron on May 13, 1919. He petitioned to remain in the Army, passed the required examinations, and received a regular commission as a 1st lieutenant in the Air Service on July 1, 1920, the date that the service was recognized by law as an organizational part of the Army. Leaving Hawaii in May 1921, Maitland became an aide to General Billy Mitchell in July and was selected as one of the pilots to take part in the sinking of the battleship Ostfriesland, a military experiment set up by Mitchell to prove the effectiveness of air power against ships. In September and October 1925 he acted as an aide to Mitchell during the Morrow Board hearings. Curtiss R-6 racer During the 1920s, Maitland competed for the Air Service and its Air Corps successor in air races and pioneering flights as part of the service's program of generating favorable publicity. While Operations Officer for Col. Augustine Warner Robins at the Fairfield Air Intermediate Depot (FAID) in October 1922, he was part of the Army team at the National Air Races held that year at Selfridge Field, Michigan. On October 14, he reputedly became the first U.S. pilot to fly faster than 200 mph (320 kmh) and received a letter of congratulations from Orville Wright. Flying a Curtiss R-6 racer over a 50-kilometer (31 miles) course, Maitland finished second in the Pulitzer Trophy race, behind Army test pilot Lt. Russell Maughan but ahead of four Navy and eight Army racers, averaging 198.8 mph (319 kmh) and reporting brief blackouts during the tight pylon turns. On March 29, 1923, he set a world's absolute speed record of 236.58 mph (380.75 kmh) over one kilometer in the R-6, but the record was disqualified because he failed to maintain level flight.According to the Air Service News Letter of May 2, 1923 (Vol. VII, No. 9, p. 2) the disqualification was made by Orville Wright, the official observer of the National Aeronautics Association, for an unintentional \\"technical violation.\\" This came soon after his second place finish in the Pulitzer Trophy Race, which occurred because his fuel pump failed after one lap, forcing him to fly the remainder of the race with one hand while he hand-pumped fuel with the other. However he broke his own record in October when he flew at a recorded speed of 244.94 mph (394.19 kmh), also in the R-6. On March 17, 1925, Maitland was assigned command of the new 18th Headquarters Squadron (redesignated from the 18th Observation Squadron) at Bolling Field, a position he held until June 4, 1925, when he returned to FAID. In November 1926 he began a three-year tour as Assistant Executive Officer to Assistant Secretary of War for Air F. Trubee Davison. Flight of the Bird of Paradise While stationed in Hawaii, Maitland sought permission from the Chief of the Air Service to organize a flight between Hawaii and the mainland. Not until December 1926, however, was he granted authorization. Others had also been working on the project, including 1st Lt. Albert F. Hegenberger, former Chief of the Instrument Branch at McCook Field., p. 126 Hegenberger had overseen the development of a number of navigation instruments that would make the trip feasible but like Maitland had also been transferred to Hawaii, where his repeated written requests for a transpacific flight were likewise refused. In 1926 Hegenberger returned to McCook, where he helped test a navigation system using signals from low-frequency radio beacons. The transpacific flight from California to Hawaii was then approved to demonstrate the difficult task of navigating to a small island using the beacons as a navigational aid. Lieutenants Lester J. Maitland (left) and Albert F. Hegenberger (right) at Wheeler Field, Hawaii, after the first non-stop flight from California to Hawaii in 1927. On June 15, 1927, Maitland and Hegenberger took the chosen airplane, an Atlantic-Fokker C-2 transport plane nicknamed the Bird of Paradise, and a team of aeronautical engineers cross country to check fuel consumption and the reliability of the aircraft and its navigational instruments. On June 24, while in San Diego, California, the results of the tests were reported to Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis and he approved the flight to Hawaii. The next day they flew to Crissy Field, at the Presidio in San Francisco, California. On June 27, Maitland and Hegenberger made the short hop from Crissy Field to the newly opened Oakland Municipal Airport, whose runway was much preferable for the takeoff roll with full fuel load, and departed the next morning just after 7 a.m. for Wheeler Field, Oahu, with Maitland as pilot and Hegenberger as navigator. Although assisted as planned by the Signal Corps beacon on Maui, the directional radio receiver in the C-2 operated only intermittently before cutting out altogether. The earth inductor compass on the C-2 failed just after takeoff, and despite increasingly cloudier weather, Hegenberger navigated most of the charted Great Circle route by dead reckoning, using a magnetic compass and driftmeter supplemented by celestial navigation observations. Contact with several ships at sea was used to verify their position and adjust the original flight plan. 23 hours into the flight, before dawn on June 29, the crew observed a lighthouse beam on Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands at their estimated time of arrival, but still in complete darkness, decided to circle until daybreak before landing at Wheeler. The Bird of Paradise completed its trip of in 25 hours and 50 minutes, and was greeted by thousands of spectators. In becoming the first to make the transpacific crossing to Hawaii, Maitland and Hegenberger earned the third awarding of Distinguished Flying Cross by the Air Corps and received the Mackay Trophy for that year. Of the feat, the official history of the United States Air Force states: > The flight...tested not only the reliability of the machine but the > navigational skill and the stamina of the two officers as well, for had they > strayed even three-and-a-half degrees off course, they would have missed > Kauai and vanished over the ocean. In 1928 Maitland and Charles Lindbergh were invited together to the White House to meet President Calvin Coolidge. Air Corps years Maitland wrote Knights of the Air, a history of early aviation emphasizing \\"aviation firsts\\" that included his own transpacific flight, and was published in 1929.Knights of the Air was published by Doubleday, Doran & Co. He then undertook writing Skyroads a serialized comic strip about aviation in 1929 with artist and fellow World War I pilot Dick Calkins. The pair continued to release Skyroads until they passed the writing and drawing duties to Calkins' assistant Russell Keaton in 1933. Northrop A-17 After his tour in Washington D.C. concluded in December 1929, Maitland served at Kelly Field, Texas, as a flight instructor in the Advanced Flying School. He was promoted to captain in 1932. Maitland served in various positions in the Training Command at Kelly, including senior instructor in Attack, to September 1934, when he entered the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field as a student in the comprehensive 845-hour, 36-week course. Making up the 59 members of his class were five majors, 40 captains including himself, 13 first lieutenants, and one second lieutenant. In addition to 49 Air Corps officers were four Army officers, one from each of that service's combat arms, two Turkish Army aviators, one Mexican captain, and three Marine Corps aviators. Among Maitland's Air Corps peers were future generals Muir S. Fairchild, Barney Giles, Laurence S. Kuter, Haywood Hansell, and Hoyt S. Vandenberg; and aviation pioneer Major Vernon Burge, who as a corporal in June 1912 had been the first certified enlisted military pilot. Maitland graduated in June 1935. From September 11, 1935, to July 16, 1938, he commanded the 8th Attack Squadron at Barksdale Field, Louisiana, flying the Northrop A-17 attack bomber. On July 20, 1940, Major Maitland and his wife Kathleen \\"Kay\\" Maitland were sent to the Philippine Department for a two-year tour of duty in command of the 28th Bombardment Squadron. By seniority he was also made base commander of Clark Field, where the 28th BS was stationed. On March 13, 1941, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and command of the 28th BS passed to a more junior officer, but Maitland remained base commander at Clark. Shortly after, the Army extended the tours of all Air Corps personnel in the Philippine Department by an additional year, fearing aggressive Japanese moves against the Philippines, and ordered their dependents to return to the United States. This created a serious morale problem that Maitland combatted at Clark, at the suggestion of a subordinate, by issuing an order in May 1941 that all base personnel (including himself) had to grow beards. He modified the order in mid-August, making beards optional, but he and many others maintained their facial hair. World War II Maitland was on the headquarters staff of the newly created Far East Air Force when the United States entered World War II. On November 3, 1941, the 19th Bomb Group completed its reinforcement movement to the Philippines and its commander, Lt. Col. Eugene Eubank, was senior to Maitland at Clark Field. When the FEAF was activated on November 16, Maitland was named as executive officer of the Far East Air Service Command. The FEAF was surprised and largely destroyed by Japanese air attack on December 8, 1941, and Gen. Douglas MacArthur ordered its headquarters withdrawn to Australia on December 24. Maitland joined a small group of staff officers flown out from Nielson Field on Christmas Day by Captain Paul I. \\"Pappy\\" Gunn in a former Philippine Air Lines Beech 18. B-26 Marauder of the 386th Bomb Group, 1943 Reassigned to duty in the United States, Maitland was named to command the 386th Bomb Group, flying B-26 Marauders, upon its activation on December 1, 1942, at MacDill Field, Florida. He organized the group and moved it on February 9, 1943, to Lake Charles Field, Louisiana, to complete its group combat training, which was accomplished without losses of any B-26s to accident in more than 10,000 hours of flight.The B-26 had a reputation among pilots as a \\"hot\\" aircraft that was notoriously difficult to fly for novices. Although the 386th BG did not lose a B-26 in training, a Lockheed B-34 assigned to tow targets for aerial gunnery practice did crash with loss of life. In June 1943 the group moved to England and was assigned to the 3rd Bomb Wing of the Eighth Air Force on June 4, 1943. Based at the new station at RAF Boxted, the 386th did not immediately enter combat because extreme losses to B-26s of the already operational 322nd Bomb Group, attacking at low altitudes, forced a suspension of all B-26 operations to develop new tactics. Over the following seven weeks the 386th embarked on an intensive training program covering aircraft recognition, flying control procedures, German fighter tactics, combat formations, and medium altitude bombing (between and ),. After flying four diversionary missions in mid-July, the 386th BG began combat operations on July 30, 1943, attacking the Luftwaffe fighter base at Woensdrecht Airfield in the Netherlands. The attack was the first at medium altitude by B-26s in Europe and was sharply contested by Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters of II./JG 26. The group, attacking alone, suffered its first loss, a bomber at the rear of the formation nicknamed Wolf and carrying 2nd Lt. Cyrus S. Eaton, Jr., son of the investment banker. Another B-26, Two Way Ticket, crashed on takeoff and was a total loss.Eaton was the only survivor of his seven-man crew and became a POW; the crew of Two Way Ticket all survived. The group continued its attacks on Luftwaffe bases in France and the low countries throughout the summer of 1943. On September 24, 1943, the 386h moved to a new base still under construction at RAF Great Dunmow, and flew its final mission as part of the Eighth Air Force on October 8, an attack on airfields in the vicinity of Lille that was abandoned because of bad weather. While with the Eight Air Force it flew 32 missions, losing six bombers in combat, and developed the procedure for the simultaneous release of bombs by formations of B-26s. It also earned a Distinguished Unit Citation for its first year of operations, part of which was under Maitland's command. On October 18 the 386th resumed operations from Great Dunmow as part of the Ninth Air Force, with Maitland leading the group in an attack on Beauvais-Nivillers airdrome in France. He also led the group in an attack on the construction site of the fortress of Mimoyecques, France, on November 5. At age 44, Maitland was one of the oldest pilots to see combat in World War II, personally leading four of first five missions of the 386th in a B-26 nicknamed the Texas Tarantula, but his tenure was cut short when he was relieved of command on November 18, 1943, possibly for excessive drinking.Bartsch noted that Maitland was commonly known to be a heavy drinker (December 8, 1941: MacArthur's Pearl Harbor, pp. 65-66). Maitland received the Silver Star, a second award of the Distinguished Flying Cross, and five Air Medals. The first group history, The History of a Bombing Outfit, said of its first commander: > His leadership of the group had been strong and colorful. He had been rough > on those who did not produce but fine to those who had. He had given a lot > of character to the group, and although he had been rough at times, had been > fair always. The group was sorry to see him go.The History of a Bombing > Outfit: The 386th Bomb Group, wartime group publication authorized by United > States Armed Forces Europe, 3 July 1945, p. 47. After World War II In 1947, Maitland was appointed Wisconsin's first state aeronautics director. He resigned the post in 1949 over the lack of priority the state gave to airports and flying. He accepted a similar post with the state of Michigan and in 1951 went on to become Michigan's Director of Civil Defense, for which he was appointed a brigadier general in the Michigan Air National Guard. In the mid-1950s Lester Maitland's career goals shifted and he was given permission by the state of Michigan to begin seminary studies. He would go on to become a lay-minister in the Episcopal Church. His first appointment was as lay-vicar at a parish in Iron River, Michigan. He retired as rector emeritus in Red Bluff, California. Maitland died at a convalescent home in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1990. He was 91 years old. Awards and decorations Citation for Distinguished Flying Cross :General Orders: War Department, General Orders No. 16 (1927) :Action Date: June 28‚Äì29, 1927 :Service: Army Air Corps :Rank: First Lieutenant The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 2, 1926, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross to First Lieutenant (Air Corps) Lester J. Maitland, U.S. Army Air Corps, for extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight. As pilot of the United States airplane, by his masterly skill, courage, endurance, and tenacity of purpose, with his navigator, Lieutenant Maitland successfully piloted his airplane on 28‚Äì29 June 1927, from Oakland, California, to Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, over the greatest expanse of open sea yet crossed in a nonstop flight. Lieutenant Maitland, with full knowledge of the dangers and difficulties, traversed over 2,400 miles of the Pacific Ocean with marvelous accuracy of direction, and thereby demonstrated conclusively the practicability of accurate aerial navigation. His masterful exploit is worthy of the greatest praise and has bestowed much credit on the United States Army.Military Times Hall of Valor, accessed August 3, 2011. Recognition legacy Maitland Field, a downtown lakefront airport in Milwaukee between 1927 and 1956, was named at a ceremony honoring Maitland for the transpacific flight on July 18, 1927, during his return trip from Hawaii.Air Corps News Letter August 9, 1927 (Vol. XI, No. 10), p. 238. In 1987 he was elected to the Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame. Maitland Drive, near the Oakland International Airport in California, is also named for him.

FM 2000, advertised as the \\"21st century radio station\\", began operations on November 24, 1994, on Coney Drive in Belize City, upstairs of the Body 2000 gym. It focused mostly on the urban demographic with modern music including rap, hip hop and reggae, mixed with other contemporary music. Among its most popular DJs were media veterans Adrian Harris, Mike Nicholson, Ed Yorke and G. Michael Reid. Later popular DJs included Karil Wallace. All of the above had left FM 2000 by 2005. FM 2000's popularity was somewhat low for much of its time on the air; it frequently trailed KREM and LOVE FM in listenership. FM 2000 officially closed shop on November 5, 2006, when it was bought by the People's United Party and turned into a station called Positive Vibes FM, on the same signals as the original FM 2000 and run by PUP public relations veteran Vaughan Gill.

Shanina volunteered for the military after the death of her brother in 1941 and chose to be a sniper on the front line. Praised for her shooting accuracy, Shanina was capable of precisely hitting enemy personnel and making doublets (two target hits by two rounds fired in quick succession). In 1944, a Canadian newspaper described Shanina as \\"the unseen terror of East Prussia\\". She became the first servicewoman of the 3rd Belorussian Front to receive the Order of Glory. Shanina was killed in action during the East Prussian Offensive while shielding the severely wounded commander of an artillery unit. Shanina's bravery received praise already during her lifetime, but conflicted with the Soviet policy of sparing snipers from heavy battles. Her combat diary was first published in 1965. Early life Roza Shanina was born on 3 April 1924 in the Russian village of Edma in Arkhangelsk Oblast to Anna Alexeyevna Shanina, a kolkhoz milkmaid, and Georgiy (Yegor) Mikhailovich Shanin, a logger who had been disabled by a wound received during World War I. Roza was reportedly named after the Marxist revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg and had six siblings: one sister Yuliya and five brothers: Mikhail, Fyodor, Sergei, Pavel, and Marat. The Shanins also raised three orphans. Roza was above average height, with light brown hair and blue eyes, and spoke in a Northern Russian dialect. After finishing four classes of elementary school in Yedma, Shanina continued her education in the village of Bereznik. As there was no school transport at the time, when she was in grades five through seven Roza had to walk to Bereznik to attend middle school. On Saturdays, Shanina again went to Bereznik to take care of her ill aunt Agnia Borisova. At the age of fourteen, Shanina, against her parents' wishes, walked across the taiga to the rail station and travelled to Arkhangelsk to study at the college there. (The trek was later attested by Shanina's school teacher Alexander Makaryin.) Shanina left home with little money and almost no possessions; and before moving to the college dormitory she lived with her elder brother Fyodor. Later in her combat diary Shanina would recall Arkhangelsk's stadium Dinamo, and the cinemas, Ars and Pobeda. Shanina's friend Anna Samsonova remembered that Roza sometimes returned from her friends in Ustyansky District to her college dormitory between 2:00 and 3:00 am. As the doors were locked by that time, the other students tied several bedsheets together to help Roza climb into her room. In 1938, Shanina became a member of the Soviet youth movement Komsomol. Two years later, Soviet secondary education institutes introduced tuition fees, and the scholarship fund was cut. Shanina received little financial support from home and on 11 September 1941, she took a job in kindergarten No. 2 (lately known as Beryozka) in Arkhangelsk, with which she was offered a free apartment. She studied in the evenings and worked in the kindergarten during the daytime. The children liked Shanina and their parents appreciated her. Shanina graduated from college in the 1941‚Äì42 academic year, when the Soviet Union was in the grip of World War II.  Tour of duty  Shanina in November 1944, wearing a male-issue wool field shirt and woollen skirt. The shirt was khaki, while the skirt was dark blue. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Arkhangelsk was bombed by the Luftwaffe, and Shanina and other townspeople were involved in firefighting and mounted voluntary vigils on rooftops to protect the kindergarten. Shanina's two elder brothers had volunteered for the military. In December 1941, a death notification was received for her 19-year-old brother Mikhail, who had died during the Siege of Leningrad. In response, Shanina went to the military commissariat to ask for permission to serve. Two more of Shanina's brothers died in the war. At that time the Soviet Union had begun deploying female snipers because they had flexible limbs, and it was believed that they were patient, careful and cunning. In February 1942, Soviet women between the ages of 16 and 45 became eligible for the military draft, but Shanina was not drafted that month, as the local military commissariat wanted to spare her from the draft. She first learned to shoot at a shooting range. On 22 June 1943, while still living in the dormitory, Shanina was accepted into the Vsevobuch program for universal military training. After Shanina's several applications, the military commissariat finally allowed her to enroll in the Central Women‚Äôs Sniper Training School, where she met Aleksandra \\"Sasha\\" Yekimova and Kaleriya \\"Kalya\\" Petrova, who became her closest friends, with Shanina calling them \\"the vagrant three\\". Honed to a fine point, Shanina scored highly in training and graduated from the academy with honours. She was asked to stay as an instructor there, but refused due to a call of duty. In 1941‚Äì1945 a total of 2,484 Soviet female snipers were deployed for the war and their combined tally of kills is estimated to be at least 11,280. After the momentous victory in the Battle of Stalingrad, the Soviets mounted nationwide counter-offensives and Shanina on 2 April 1944 joined the 184th Rifle Division, where a separate female sniper platoon had been formed. Shanina was appointed a commander of that platoon. Three days later, southeast of Vitebsk, Shanina killed her first German soldier. In Shanina's own words, recorded by an anonymous author, her legs gave way after that first encounter and she slid down into the trench, saying, \\"I've killed a man.\\" Concerned, the other women ran up saying, \\"That was a fascist you finished off!\\" Seven months later, Shanina wrote in her diary that she was now killing the enemy in cold blood and saw the meaning of her life in her actions. She wrote that if she had to do everything over again, she would still strive to enter the sniper academy and go to the front again. For her actions in the battle for the village of Kozyi Gory (Smolensk Oblast), Shanina was awarded her first military decoration, the Order of Glory 3rd Class, on 18 April 1944. She became the first servicewoman of the 3rd Belorussian Front to receive that order. According to the report of Major Degtyarev (the commander of the 1138th Rifle Regiment), she received the award for the corresponding commendation list, between 6 and 11 April Shanina killed 13 enemy soldiers while subjected to artillery and machine gun fire. By May 1944, her sniper tally increased to 17 confirmed enemy kills, and Shanina was praised as a precise and brave soldier. The same year, on 9 June, Shanina's portrait was featured on the front page of the Soviet newspaper Unichtozhim Vraga. When Operation Bagration commenced in the Vitebsk region on 22 June 1944, it was decided that female snipers would be withdrawn. They voluntarily continued to support the advancing infantry anyway, and despite the Soviet policy of sparing snipers, Shanina asked to be sent to the front line. Although her request was refused, she went anyway. Shanina was later sanctioned for going to the front line without permission, but did not face a court martial. She wanted to be attached to a battalion or a reconnaissance company, turning to the commander of the 5th Army, Nikolai Krylov. Shanina also wrote twice to Joseph Stalin with the same request. From 26 to 28 June 1944, Shanina participated in the elimination of the encircled German troops near Vitebsk during the Vitebsk‚ÄìOrsha Offensive. As the Soviet army advanced further westward, from 8 to 13 July of the same year, Shanina and her sisters- in-arms took part in the battle for Vilnius, which had been under German occupation since 24 June 1941. The Germans were finally driven out from Vilnius on 13 July 1944. During the Soviet summer offensives of that year Shanina managed to capture three Germans. From her time at the military academy, Shanina became known for her ability to score doublets (two target hits made in quick succession). During one period she crawled through a muddy communications trench each day at dawn to a specially camouflaged pit which overlooked German-controlled territory. She wrote, \\"the unconditional requirementto outwit the enemy and kill himbecame an irrevocable law of my hunt\\". Shanina successfully used counter-sniper tactics against a German cuckoo sniper hidden in a tree, by waiting until dusk when the space between the tree branches would be backlit by sunlight and the sniper's nest became visible. On one occasion, Shanina also made use of selective fire from a submachine gun.  Diary  One of Shanina's notebooks Shanina enjoyed writing and would often send letters to her home village and to her friends in Arkhangelsk. She started writing a combat diary; although diaries were strictly prohibited in the Soviet military, there were some furtive exceptions, such as The Front Diary of Izrael Kukuyev and The Chronicle of War of Muzagit Hayrutdinov. To preserve military secrecy, Shanina termed the killed and wounded \\"blacks\\" and \\"reds\\" respectively in her diary. Shanina kept the diary from 6 October 1944 to 24 January 1945. After Shanina's death, the diary, consisting of three thick notebooks, was kept by the war correspondent Pyotr Molchanov for twenty years in Kiev. An abridged version was published in the magazine Yunost in 1965, and the diary was transferred to the Regional Museum of Arkhangelsk Oblast. Several of Shanina's letters and some data from her sniper log have also been published.  East Prussia  thumb|upright|left |Shanina with a sniper badge In August 1944 advancing Soviet troops had reached the Soviet border with East Prussia and by 31 August of that year Shanina's battle count reached 42 kills. The following month the ≈†e≈°upƒó River was crossed. Shanina's 184th Rifle Division became the first Soviet unit to enter East Prussia. At that time, two Canadian newspapers, the Ottawa Citizen and Leader-Post, reported that according to an official dispatch from the ≈†e≈°upƒó River front, Shanina killed five Germans in one day as she crouched in a sniper hideout. Later in September her sniper tally had reached 46 kills, of which 15 were made on German soil and seven during an offensive. On 17 September, Unichtozhim Vraga credited Shanina with 51 hits. In the third quarter of 1944, Shanina was given a short furlough and visited Arkhangelsk. She returned to the front on 17 October for one day, and later received an honourable certificate from the Central Committee of Komsomol. On 16 September 1944, Shanina was awarded her second military distinction, the Order of Glory 2nd Class for intrepidity and bravery displayed in various battles against the Germans in that year. On 26 October 1944 Shanina became eligible for the Order of Glory 1st Class for her actions in a battle near Schlossberg (now Dobrovolsk), but ultimately received the Medal for Courage instead. She was among the first female snipers to receive the Medal for Courage. Shanina was awarded the medal on 27 December for the gallant posture displayed during a German counter-offensive on 26 October. There Shanina fought together with Captain Igor Aseyev, a Hero of the Soviet Union, and witnessed his death on 26 October. Shanina, who served as an assistant platoon commander, was ordered to commit the female snipers to combat. Schlossberg was finally retaken from Germans by the troops of the 3rd Belorussian Front on 16 January 1945 during the Insterburg‚ÄìK√∂nigsberg Operation. On 12 December 1944, an enemy sniper shot Shanina in her right shoulder. She wrote in her diary that she had not felt the pain, \\"the shoulder was just scalded with something hot.\\" Although the injury, which Shanina described as \\"two small holes\\", seemed minor to her, she needed an operation and was incapacitated for several days. She reported in her diary that the previous day she had a prophetic dream in which she was wounded in exactly the same place. On 8 January 1945 Nikolai Krylov formally allowed Shanina to participate in front-line combat, albeit with great reluctance: previously Shanina was denied that permission by the commander of the 184th Rifle Division and the military council of the 5th Army as well. Five days later, the Soviets launched the East Prussian Offensive, which prompted heavy fighting in East Prussia. By 15 January, travelling with divisional logistics, Shanina reached the East Prussian town of Eydtkuhnen (now Chernyshevskoye), where she used white military camouflage. Several days later, she experienced friendly fire from a Katyusha rocket launcher and wrote in her diary, \\"Now I understand why the Germans are so afraid of Katyushas. What a fire!\\" At the border of East Prussia, Shanina killed 26 enemy soldiers. The last unit she served in was the 144th Rifle Division. According to the online Book of Memory of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Shanina served in the 205th Special Motorized Rifle Battalion of that division. Shanina had hoped to go to university after the war, or if that was not possible, to raise orphans. In the course of her tour of duty Shanina was mentioned in despatches several times. Her final sniper tally reached fifty- nine confirmed kills (fifty-four, according to other sources), including twelve kills during the Battle of Vilnius, with sixty-two enemies knocked out of action. Domestically her achievements were acknowledged particularly by the war correspondent Ilya Ehrenburg and in the newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, which said that Shanina was one of the best snipers in her unit and that even veteran soldiers were inferior to her in shooting accuracy. Shanina's exploits were also reported in the Western press, particularly in Canadian newspapers, where she was called \\"the unseen terror of East Prussia\\". She paid no special attention to the achieved renown, and once wrote that she had been overrated. On 16 January 1945 Shanina wrote in her combat diary: \\"What I've actually done? No more than I have to as a Soviet person, having stood up to defend the motherland.\\" She also wrote, \\"The essence of my happiness is fighting for the happiness of others. It's strange, why is it that in grammar, the word \\"happiness\\" can only be singular? That is counter to its meaning, after all. ... If it turns necessary to die for the common happiness, then I'm braced to.\\"  Death  Death notification sent to Shanina's mother by the 205th Separate Medical and Sanitary Battalion. In the face of the East Prussian Offensive, the Germans tried to strengthen the localities they controlled against great odds. In a diary entry dated 16 January 1945, Shanina wrote that despite her wish to be in a safer place, some unknown force was drawing her to the front line. In the same entry she wrote that she had no fear and that she had even agreed to go \\"to a melee combat.\\" The next day, Shanina wrote in a letter that she might be on the verge of being killed because her battalion had lost 72 out of 78 people. Her last diary entry reports that German fire had become so intense that the Soviet troops, including herself, had sheltered inside self-propelled guns. On 27 January Shanina was severely injured and was later found by two soldiers disemboweled, with her chest torn open by a shell fragment. Despite attempts to save her, Shanina died the following day near the Richau estate (later a Soviet settlement of Telmanovka), northwest of the East Prussian village of Ilmsdorf (). Nurse Yekaterina Radkina remembered Shanina telling her that she regretted having done so little. By the day of Shanina's death the Soviets had overtaken several major East Prussian localities, including Tilsit, Insterburg and Pillau, and approached K√∂nigsberg. Recalling the moment Shanina's mother received notification of her daughter's death, her brother Marat wrote: \\"I clearly remembered mother's eyes. They weren't teary anymore. ... 'That's all, that's all'‚Äîshe repeated\\". Shanina was buried under a spreading pear tree on the shore of the Alle River‚Äînow called the Lava‚Äî and was later reinterred in the settlement of Wehlau. Posthumous honours In 1964‚Äì65 a renewed interest in Shanina arose in the Soviet press, largely due to the publication of her diary. The newspaper Severny Komsomolets asked Shanina's contemporaries to write what they knew about her. Streets in Arkhangelsk, Shangaly and Stroyevskoye were named after her, and the village of Yedma has a museum dedicated to Shanina. The local school where she studied in 1931‚Äì35 has a commemorative plate. In Arkhangelsk, regular shooting competitions were organized among members of the paramilitary DOSAAF sport organisation for the Roza Shanina Prize, while Novodvinsk organized an open shooting sports championship in her memory. The village of Malinovka in Ustyansky District started to hold annual cross- country ski races for the Roza Shanina Prize. In 1985, the Council of Veterans of the Russian Central Women Sniper Academy unsuccessfully requested the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to posthumously bestow the Order of Glory 1st Class on Shanina (which would have made her a Full Cavalier of that order). In the same year, Russian author Nikolai Zhuravlyov published the book Posle boya vernulas (Returned After Battle). Its title refers to Shanina's words, \\"I will return after the battle,\\" which she uttered after receiving a note from her battalion commander urging her to return to the rear immediately. Verses have been composed about Shanina, such as those by writer Nikolai Nabitovich. A small memorial stele dedicated to Shanina (part of a three-piece monument) was erected in Bogdanovsky settlement, Ustyansky District. In 2000, Shanina's name appeared on the war memorial stone of the Siberian State Technological University, although there is no evidence she had any affiliation with it during her life. Russian author Viktor Logvinov controversially wrote in the 1970s that Shanina had studied in the Siberian Forestry Institute and that she was the daughter of an \\"old Krasnoyarsk communist\\". The claim was continued by Krasnoyarsk publications in later years, particularly in 2005. In 2013, a wall of memory, featuring graffiti portraits of six Russian war honorees, including Roza Shanina, was opened in Arkhangelsk.  Character and personal life  The war correspondent Pyotr Molchanov, who had frequently met Shanina at the front, described her as a person of unusual will with a genuine, bright nature. Shanina described herself as \\"boundlessly and recklessly talky\\" during her college years. She typified her own character as like that of the Romantic poet, painter and writer Mikhail Lermontov, deciding, like him, to act as she saw fit. Shanina dressed modestly and liked to play volleyball. According to Shanina's sister- in-arms Lidiya Vdovina, Roza used to sing her favourite war song \\"Oy tumany moi, rastumany\\" (\\"O My Mists\\") each time she cleaned her weapon. Shanina had a straightforward character and valued courage and the absence of egotism in people. She once told a story when \\"about half a hundred frenzied fascists with wild cries\\" attacked a trench accommodating twelve female snipers, including Shanina: \\"Some fell from our well-aimed bullets, some we finished with our bayonets, grenades, shovels, and some we took prisoners, having restrained their arms.\\" Shanina's personal life was thwarted by war. On 10 October 1944, she wrote in her diary, \\"I can't accept that Misha Panarin doesn't live anymore. What a good guy! [He] has been killed ... He loved me, I know, and so did I ... My heart is heavy, I'm twenty, but I have no close [male] friend\\". In November 1944, Shanina wrote that she \\"is flogging into her head that [she] loves\\" a man named Nikolai, although he \\"doesn't shine in upbringing and education\\". In the same entry she wrote that she did not think about marriage because \\"it's not the time now\\". She later wrote that she \\"had it out\\" with Nikolai and \\"wrote him a note in the sense of 'but I'm given to the one and will love no other one\\". Ultimately in her last diary record, filled with grim tones, Shanina wrote that she \\"cannot find a solace\\" now and is \\"of no use to anyone\\".

On March 28, 1915, the British steamship Falaba was torpedoed and sunk by German U-boat . In the incident, 104 people were killed, including one American passenger, Leon Chester Thrasher, a 31-year-old mining engineer from Massachusetts.  Background  On 4 Feb. 1915, the German Admiralty declared a war zone around Britain, with all ships in that zone to be targeted. Germany's 30 submarines then began sinking all vessels, whether belligerent or neutral. Though they had secret orders to spare American ships, a freighter and a tanker were sunk. Britain responded by tightening its blockade of Germany that included food. The British Admiralty instructed ships to steer away or to ram any submarine that they encountered. They were not to zigzag. The American government, led by US President Woodrow Wilson and US Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, responded with a protest to the German government on 10 February. Wilson and Bryan called the German intention \\"an act so unprecedented in naval warfare\\" and that the US would hold the Germans to \\"a strict accountability for such acts of their naval authorities.\\" On 27 March 1915, the Falaba of the Elder Dempster Lines left Liverpool for West Africa. She was operating with a crew of 95 and carried 147 passengers, one of whom was the American mining engineer Leon Chester Thrasher (sometimes spelled Thresher). In addition, the ship was carrying 13 tons of cartridges and gunpowder.  Sinking  On 28 March, at 1140, the conning tower of U-28, commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant von Forstner, was sighted by Chief Officer Walter Baxter. Captain Frederick Davies then ordered the Falaba to steer away at maximum speed. However, Davies then ordered them to stop and to send two wireless messages of their predicament, the result of the Germans warning the ship to \\"stop or I will fire.\\" Forstner then ordered Davies to abandon the ship, as it was to be sunk. The evacuation was disorganized, which resulted in several casualties. A torpedo amidships sank the ship quickly. One of the 104 persons to die in the incident was Leon Thrasher, who was the first American to die from the action of a German submarine.  Aftermath  Though Wilson thought international law had been violated, Bryan wondered \\"whether an American citizen can, by putting his business above his regard for his country, assume for his own advantage unnecessary risks and thus involve his country in international complications.\\" The sinking of the Lusitania prompted the Americans to send a diplomatic note to the Germans asking for an apology and reparations for both ships. The note included a warning that the US would take \\"any necessary act in sustaining the rights of its citizens or in safeguarding the sacred duties of international law.\\" The Gore-McLemore resolution, introduced by two southern members of Congress directed the President to warn Americans against traveling aboard foreign ships of belligerent nations, and even proposed confiscating passports of citizens who failed to comply. In keeping with that sentiment, and supporting the isolationist views of his constituents, Representative Frank Park of Georgia affirmed that he opposed any policy that would \\"hurl the sons of the South to death and destruction because some fool, or idiot, or nonpatriotic rascal\\" chose to sail on a \\"belligerent armed vessel\\". After persistent requests by Bryan, documents detailing witness statements from the sinking of Falaba offered proof that the captain of U-28 gave adequate warnings and time for Falaba to offload passengers. Instead, the crew of Falaba had used that time to radio the position of the submarine to nearby armed British patrol ships. As the warship approached, the submarine fired at the last minute and detonated nearly thirteen tons of contraband high explosives in Falabas cargo. Colin Simpson, The Lusitania, p. 82. Thrasher's remains washed ashore on Ireland's coast on July 11, 1915, after it had been in the water for 106 days. Initially, authorities mistook him for a victim and designated him Body No. 248. After reviewing Lord Mersey's investigation of the incident, Alastair Walker commented that \\"had the crew been well organized and the passengers well led, all of those on the ship could have been safely evacuated before the torpedo was fired. The sinking of the ship was down to von Forstner and U-28; responsibility for the loss of life, however lay with Elder, Dempster, their Marine Superintendent and his brother-in-law Fred Davies.\\" References Sources *American Journal of International Law, Vol. 9, No. 2 (April 1915), pp. 503‚Äì513. * Atlantic Liners, The Pre-Lusitania Sinkings, J.

Since 2000 the College has also been the centre for the Clontarf Football Academy run by the Clontarf Foundation a program of Australian rules football for indigenous youth. Opening in 1901, the facility has been used for a number of purposes since, most notably as an orphanage for boys operated by the Christian Brothers organisation; and also as a convent and as a day and boarding school. During World War II it was used as a training school for the Royal Australian Air Force. Through its history, it has housed and educated day boys and boarders, orphans, vagrants, children from disadvantaged families, child migrants and Aboriginal children. Location The estate is situated on the northern banks of the Canning River between the river and Manning Road, east of Elderfield Road. Curtin University of Technology is nearby. It was expanded several times over the years through purchases of adjoining land and ultimately occupied over . From 1981 large portions of the property were subdivided and became the residential suburb of Waterford.City of South Perth Municipal Heritage Inventory - Origin and meaning of Place Names Etymology The name Clontarf comes from Clontarf (Irish: Cluain Tarbh, meaning \\"meadow of the bull\\"), a wealthy suburb in the north-east of Dublin, Ireland, reflecting the origins of the founder of the Christian Brothers, Edmund Ignatius Rice, as well as many of the early Christian brothers. Clontarf, Ireland, was the site of the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 which saw the defeat of the Vikings by Brian Boru, a High King of Ireland from 1002 to 1014. History In 1897, the Christian Brothers assumed control of the Sisters of Mercy orphanage in Subiaco which housed 81 boys. Shortly after, the Brothers located and acquired land on the banks of the Canning River near present-day Manning. The Bishop of Perth, Matthew Gibney, laid the foundation stone for the new building in 1901. Originally named St Joseph's Boys' Orphanage, the first building was completed in September 1901 and the first boys were transferred there shortly after. The Superior was Brother Kevin Ryan and other Brothers Bodkin and O'Connor also assisted. Various other buildings including a bakehouse, laundry, store-room and toilets were soon constructed, however most of these early structures have since been demolished. Sometime later it was renamed to St Peter's Intermediate Orphanage. In 1908 Adolphus Lecaille (a pioneer priest in the Geraldton Diocese) was buried in the grounds on the orphanage. In 1936 his remains were exhumed and reburied in the mortuary chapel of St Francis Xavier Cathedral in Geraldton. Clontarf chapel By 1919, Brother Paul Keaney joined the staff and it became known as Clontarf Boy's Orphanage. In 1927, access to the community was improved after a road from Canning Bridge through to Albany Highway was constructed. Originally called Clontarf Road, this is now known as Manning Road. By the 1930s Clontarf was almost self-sufficient with an extensive orchard and vegetable garden as well as a dairy, poultry yard, a piggery and holdings of other livestock. It housed between 100 and 150 boys, usually aged between six and fourteen years. Boys received a primary school education, religious teaching and training in basic manual skills and farm practices. Government funding for the boys was withdrawn at the age of fourteen which was when most boys left. Between 1936 and 1942, Brother Keaney served a second period as Superior during which he introduced an apprenticeship scheme that provided the boys with trade skills. Many buildings were constructed during the period using the boys as labourers. It is estimated that 300,000 bricks were laid by the boys for a new chapel which was built and consecrated in 1941 by Archbishop Redmond Prendiville. Other tasks done by the boys included roof tiling and carpentry work. In 1941 the orphanage was renamed Clontarf Boys' Town and around that time started taking orphans from Britain. With the advent of World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) seconded the site as a training school between 1942 and 1945. The Brothers and the boys moved to new farm schools at Bindoon and Tardun. After the war, the Christian Brothers returned with the Sisters of Mercy also using some of the buildings as a convent through to 1966. A junior secondary school was also introduced with some boys moving to the nearby Aquinas College to complete their schooling. By 1953, the population was 249 and in 1961 it was opened to day pupils and boarders. It was renamed to Clontarf School and in 1964 had a peak enrolment of 303 boys. From the early 1970s, the Christian Brothers started to use the facilities as a treatment centre for adolescents with behavioural problems and day boys ceased to be enrolled by 1977. Enrolments were reduced to 30 by the early 1980s. It closed in April 1984 but reopened as the Clontarf Aboriginal College on 2 May 1986. Up to 50 Indigenous Australian boys from remote areas of the state board at two hostels run by the college, one at North Beach and the other at North Fremantle. As of 2010, the College is planning to build a boarding facility on site. Allegations of abuse In 1920, Christian Brother Frederick Philip Carmody was sentenced to nine years gaol for sexual abuse of boys at Clontarf.Western Australian News, Daily Mail (Brisbane), 9 Dec 1920. In the late 1980s, allegations of abuse and cruelty were made against the Christian Brothers by former students and residents of various institutions run by the order, including Clontarf. An organisation named VOICES (Victims of Institutionalised Cruelty, Exploitation and Supporters) was established to represent and provide counselling for those who had experienced abuse at the Christian Brothers‚Äô orphanages. Brother Paul Keaney in particular was named as an instigator of the cruelty and abuse.Speech by Senator Andrew Murray (19 September 2001) The Christian Brothers accepted that there was strong evidence that many of the allegations were true, and made a public apology.Sins Of The Brothers ABC Lateline transcript (24 November 1998) A legal action brought by over 200 former students ran from 1993 in the New South Wales Supreme Court and was finalised in 1996 with an out of court settlement.Speech by Senator Andrew Murray (28 October 2002)  See also  * List of schools in the Perth metropolitan area * List of boarding schools References Bibliography *City of South Perth Municipal heritage Inventory Place Record Form Heritage Council of W.A.

The player controls an underwater explorer who scours deep sea environments around the world for treasure in scuba gear and submersibles while undertaking various missions and fending off hostile pirates and sea life. It was developed by Black Ops Entertainment. The game was published in North America by Namco and by Sony Computer Entertainment in Europe, and met with strong critical approval for its compelling undersea atmosphere. The soundtrack was provided by video game composer Tommy Tallarico. Gameplay The gameplay in Treasures of the Deep focuses on underwater exploration in a variety of wetsuits and gradually more powerful one-man submersibles, in order to fulfill objectives such as capping underwater oil leaks, exploring shipwrecks, recovering plane crash victims and destroying hostile installations. Finding treasure is a secondary objective. Ancient gems from a sunken ship can be put towards upgrading weapons, equipment, and subs. Various wildlife populate the levels, including sharks that attack the player and bleeding divers and animals. The player is fined for killing harmless and endangered species. The game takes place in 14 diverse underwater locations, ranging from the Bermuda Triangle to Antarctica. The levels are designed to evoke a claustrophobic and moody environment. There is an unlockable 'bonus' level, Atlantis. When the player earns a high score, another bonus level is temporarily unlocked, 'Shark Attack', where the player controls a shark and aims to eat as many sea creatures and divers as possible before the time runs out. Plot The game manual identifies the player character as Jack Runyan, a retired Navy SEAL and Gulf War veteran, now under hire of the Undersea Mercenary Agency (UMA), operating in an undersea base near the island of Vieques. Earliest mission comprends raids on sunken Spanish galleon Concepcion in Puerto Rico trench, nazist gold lost among Ionian Sea, aztec treasures in underwater tombs near Yucatan Peninsula, and Hormuz Strait break raid. During the game, the player is involved fighting Simon Black, the head of Seismic Corp, an organization that has been conducting illicit activities. In response to UMA's involvement, Black commits a wave of terrorism across the world's oceans, such as bombarding coral reefs with radiation, provoking seismic activity, and downing the Space Shuttle Atlantis to prevent the deployment of a spy satellite. At the climax of the game, Black's secret headquarters are discovered within ice caverns in Antarctica, where the player faces off and destroys Black along his personal underwater combat vehicle. Development The programmers used 16 levels of distance fog to clarify the approach of objects and creatures. Reception Treasures of the Deep received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critics especially lauded the game's balance of exploration and action and its compelling undersea ambiance. Next Generation remarked that where previous undersea games amounted to little more than \\"space shooters with a deeper blue hue ... Black Ops actually recognized the tremendous potential for adventures in undersea environments, and with refreshing creativity, brings us the most compelling shooter in quite some time.\\" Kraig Kujawa of Electronic Gaming Monthly made it his pick for \\"Sleeper Hit of the Holidays\\" and called it \\"an undersea action game that adeptly combines action, exploration and resource management into one, very cool package\\" while Glenn Rubenstein commented in GameSpot, \\"Like the movie The Abyss, Treasures sets you in a sprawling area where you never know what will happen next - you could come upon a school of fish, get attacked from behind, then worry that your blood could attract sharks.\\" Critics further credited the convincing animation, sound effects, and wildlife with helping to realize the game's strong aquatic atmosphere. GamePro summed up that \\"Sharp graphics and animation effectively create a free-roaming 3D ocean environment that's almost more fun to explore than carrying out your mission objectives.\\" The variety of missions was also praised.

In 1985, radio broadcaster Eric Rhoads became friendly with Shovan, and met with owner Bob Sillerman to acquire the struggling magazine. Rhoads changed the name to Radio Ink because of a class-action lawsuit by Tower Records -- which was launching the national magazine Pulse! -- against all publications named \\"Pulse\\". Rhoads negotiated with Tower Records founder Russ Soloman and changed the name of The Pulse of Broadcasting to Radio Ink, previously the name of a gossip column in the magazine.

It was written by Jennifer Celotta and directed by Harold Ramis. The episode originally aired in the United States on December 14, 2006, on NBC. In the episode, Christmas time at the office leads to depression for Michael, when his girlfriend Carol (Nancy Walls) breaks up with him. Michael, Andy, Dwight, and Jim then go to a local Benihana restaurant, where Michael and Andy find dates with two of the restaurant's waitresses. Back at the office, after a conflict with a bossy Angela, Karen and Pam decide to create their own Christmas party. When the majority of the office decide to go to Karen and Pam's party, Angela becomes upset, and seeing this, Karen and Pam decide to combine the parties. Soon after, Michael and Andy's dates leave them, but Michael nevertheless finds someone to go to Jamaica with him. Plot Carol Stills (Nancy Walls) confronts Michael Scott (Steve Carell) about the Christmas card he sent her, in which he superimposed his head on the body of Carol's former husband in a family photo. She breaks off the relationship, leaving Michael heartbroken and stuck with a pair of tickets to Jamaica. For the past several months, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) has led Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to believe that he is being recruited by the CIA, and her gift to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is that he can choose Dwight's first assignment. Jim declines the gift and claims that as the new office \\"Number Two\\" he should not be engaging in such activities, leaving Pam discouraged by a changed Jim. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) takes Michael to Benihana to help him forget his recent troubles; Michael drags Dwight and Jim along. The group stumbles upon an unexpecting couple (Anne Sertich and Stephen Saux) at the table and Dwight fails when attempting to impress the chef with his knowledge of Japanese knives. Andy successfully isolates Dwight from the rest of the party and convinces Michael to ask out their waitress, Cindy (Brittany Ishibashi). Meanwhile, Jim plays pranks on Dwight and realizes that his excuse for declining Pam's gift does not hold water. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) kicks Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) off the Party Planning Committee. In response, Pam reaches out to Karen, and the two plan a rival party. Jim appears uncomfortable with Pam and Karen's new friendship. Roy comes into the break room and chats with Pam. After he leaves, Karen suggests that Pam should date Roy. Pam pauses to tell Karen her history with Roy before instead replying with \\"maybe.\\" The rival Christmas parties begin, and the office staff members are forced to choose sides. Pam and Karen's party is a hit, while Angela's is a dreary affair. Michael and Andy each return with a waitress as their \\"new girlfriend\\" (though neither is the one who waited on them at the restaurant). Angela accepts Pam's offer to merge the parties. Oscar enters the office with his partner Gil just as Angela is singing \\"The Little Drummer Boy,\\" pauses for a moment, says, \\"Too soon\\" and leaves. Meanwhile, Michael is unable to tell the two waitresses apart. To remedy this, he surreptitiously marks his date's arm with a Sharpie. When he offers to take her to Jamaica, she declines and says that she has to attend school, and the two waitresses leave the party because it \\"blows\\". Jim consoles Michael by explaining that he just had a \\"rebound\\" relationship. Jim mentions that they are fun for a while, but then you keep on thinking about the girl that broke your heart, implying he still thinks about Pam (the girl who \\"broke his heart\\"). From his office, Michael makes a phone call and asks an unknown person to go to Jamaica with him. The offer is accepted. Pam is crushed when she sees Jim and Karen exchange gifts. Jim is crushed when he sees Roy give a gift to Pam. At the end of the day, Jim tells Pam that a helicopter will be arriving to take Dwight to a welcoming party at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. As Dwight waits on the roof, he receives the text message: \\"You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.\\" Dwight throws his phone off the roof and walks away.  Production  \\"A Benihana Christmas\\" was directed by Harold Ramis. \\"A Benihana Christmas\\" was written by Jennifer Celotta and directed by Harold Ramis. Ramis would return to direct the third-season episodes \\"Safety Training\\" and \\"Beach Games\\", as well as the sixth-season episode \\"The Delivery\\" (Pt. II). The episode was shot in a real Benihana restaurant. During filming, John Krasinski threw a shrimp across the table at Rainn Wilson. It bounced off Dwight's glasses and landed in the glass of water from which he was about to drink; according to actor Ed Helms, \\"It was a one- in-a-million shot that pretty much shut down the set for five or 10 minutes of applause.\\" Ultimately, however, Ramis decided not to use the footage because it looked so improbable as to be unbelievable. The actresses who played the women that Andy and Michael bring back to the office were different from the actresses who played the waitresses in the Benihana restaurant. According to the show's prop master, this was because Andy and Michael failed to pick up the original waitresses, and settled for \\"less attractive ones\\". However, at Paley Fest 2007, Greg Daniels admitted that the women they cast were \\"too good-looking\\", which led to the joke failing since the original script specifically called for Andy and Michael's dates to be unattractive.  Reception  \\"A Benihana Christmas\\" was first broadcast on December 14, 2006 in the United States. According to estimates by the Nielsen Media Research's the episode was watched by an estimated 8.44 million viewers. The episode earned a 3.9/11 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 3.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. Among that demographic, The Office finished in twenty-first place for the week among all of the major networks. On the day that the episode first aired, it was the second most watched show of the night, behind only CBS's Survivor: Cook Islands. \\"A Benihana Christmas\\" was generally well received by critics. The episode was also given a 9.2 out of 10 rating by IGN.

History After leaving the New Jersey band Deadguy in 1996, vocalist Tim Singer and guitarist Keith Huckins moved on to form Kiss it Goodbye with bassist Thom Rusnack and drummer Andrew Gormley. Huckins, Rusnack and Gormley were already familiar musically as they had all previously performed together in the New Jersey band Rorschach. A demo tape titled Be Afraid was quickly recorded and heavily circulated around the New York City area which responded with high praise. The demo is the only recording made by the group to feature guitarist Eric Cooper. The band recorded their 1997 debut LP She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not for Revelation Records. Produced by Billy Anderson, the album had the same familiar sound that fans of Deadguy and Rorschach had come to know along with Singer's melodramatic screams and ramblings. The tracks \\"Preacher\\" and \\"Target Practice\\" which were omitted from She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not were also released this same year as a 7\\" EP through Revelation. In 1997, the band toured with Unsane. They also toured with death metal outfit Obituary. Shortly after the tour, Huckins decided the touring and music were no longer to his liking and was replaced by Seattle hardcore veteran and Kiss It Goodbye illustrator Demian \\"Headboy\\" Johnston. The band recorded material in 1998 for an EP that was to be released by Sub Pop Records but was never released by the label as Tim Singer soon decided to leave the band, effectively dissolving it. The tracks were eventually released by Revelation Records as the Choke CD/7\\" EP. The band briefly reunited to perform a short westcoast reunion tour during 2012. To celebrate, Revelation Records repressed She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not on vinyl.

At his peak, he was a highly regarded Major League Baseball player. He broke into the big leagues with the St. Louis Browns, located just a few hours from his home in southern Illinois, making it possible for family to occasionally travel to watch him play. Rice hailed from near the town of Ware, Illinois. His hometown is often listed as Ware Station, Illinois. He attended Mound City High School in Mound City, Illinois. Rice made his big league debut on April 18, 1923. He joined the St. Louis Browns at a time of high expectations. After a stellar performance by the 1922 Browns and with star player and future Hall of Famer George Sisler, their owner predicted a World Series would soon come to Sportsman‚Äôs Park. Seating capacity was increased by almost one-third. Rice‚Äôs arrival was important as Sisler was forced to miss the entire 1923 season due to double vision resulting from sinusitis. Rice‚Äôs batting average of .359 for the Browns in 1925 was the sixth-best in the American League that season, and Rice placed fifth in the voting for the league's Most Valuable Player. He enjoyed another good season and received MVP consideration in 1926, ending with a .313 average and a career-best 181 hits. Sportsman‚Äôs did host a World Series in 1926, but it was the Browns‚Äô tenants, the upstart St. Louis Cardinals who beat the Yankees and captured their first World Series title. Rice had another solid season for the Browns in 1927 before being traded to Detroit in December 1927. In 1928, he hit .302 and had a career best 20 stolen bases for the Tigers. His .304 average and 69 RBI in 1929 again earned some MVP consideration. He was traded again on May 30, 1930 with two other players for a pair of well-known Yankees stars, infielder Mark Koenig and pitcher Waite Hoyt. He formed part of a formidable outfield that also included future Hall of Famers Babe Ruth and Earle Combs. The 1930 season turned out to be Rice's only year as a Yankee. He appeared in 100 games, batting .298 with 74 RBI in a lineup that also included Lou Gehrig. Rice appeared in 47 games for the Washington Senators in 1931 and did not appear in the majors in 1932. His last Major League season was in 1933 with the Cincinnati Reds. Legendary St. Louis sportswriter Bob Broeg recalled Rice as a premier defender with a very strong throwing arm. He was predominantly an outfielder, appearing in over 7,800 innings in the outfield, usually in center or right field. However, Rice has the rare distinction of playing every position, except pitcher, during his career. Yankees historians recall Rice‚Äôs defense as an opposing player from a play in 1931 that turned a Gehrig home run into a triple in the record books. With a runner on base, Gehrig homered to center field. The ball caromed back so quickly to Rice, playing outfield for the Washington Senators, that the baserunner, Lyn Lary, mistakenly thought Rice had caught it. Lary ran to the dugout instead of crossing home plate. Gehrig was awarded a triple instead of a home run. Over 10 seasons, Rice's offensive statistics were: 1,034 Games, 3,740 At Bats, 620 Runs, 1,118 Hits, 186 Doubles, 63 Triples, 48 Home Runs, 501 RBI, 59 Stolen Bases, 376 Walks, .299 Batting Average, .368 On-base percentage, .421 Slugging Percentage, 1,574 Total Bases and 99 Sacrifice Hits. He hit .300 or better 5 times in his major league career. He died in Portland, Oregon at the age of 69.

Playing for Duke University in college, in 1963 he was USBWA Player of the Year,AP Player of the Year, UPI Player of the Year, Sporting News Player of the Year, Helms Foundation College Player of the Year, a consensus first-team All-American, ACC Player of the Year, and ACC Athlete of the Year. That year he was the first overall pick in the first round of the 1963 NBA draft. He went on to have a 310-game professional career in the NBA and ABA. Early years Heyman, who was Jewish, was born in New York City, and later lived in Rockville Centre, New York, and Oceanside, New York. After attending Oceanside High School in Nassau County, New York, the 6'5\\" guard/forward was heavily recruited by many schools, and originally signed a letter of intent to play for the North Carolina Tar Heels. At the last moment, however, Heyman changed his mind and agreed to play for the Tar Heels' greatest rivals, the Duke Blue Devils. College career Due to NCAA eligibility rules that prohibited freshmen from playing varsity sports, Heyman played his first year at then racially segregated Duke with the freshman team, which compiled a record of 10‚Äì5, including three victories over the Tar Heels. During one of the Duke-North Carolina freshman games, North Carolina freshman Dieter Krause attacked Heyman, leading to a melee where the two coaches had to be restrained from attacking each other. Heyman needed five stitches after the attack. During his sophomore season, Heyman starred for the varsity team, and North Carolina and Duke again were at each other's throats. On February 4, 1961, the Duke and North Carolina freshman teams had played the first game of the double header. There were multiple fights during the game, and North Carolina had finished the game with only three players on the floor (five North Carolina players had fouled out, and three more had been ejected for fighting). During the varsity game that night, Heyman was involved in two incidents, where he first pushed over a fan who he thought was attacking him, and then in the closing minutes of the game, while trying to protect a slim Duke lead, Heyman committed a hard foul against future Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown who was attempting to drive to the hoop. Brown threw the ball and then a punch at Heyman, touching off a general melee, which saw future basketball executive Donnie Walsh, then a substitute player for North Carolina, also attack Heyman. The melee lasted about ten minutes, and despite Heyman being ejected for fighting, his 36 points had given Duke the victory, 81‚Äì77. Brown, Walsh and Heyman were all suspended for the remainder of the ACC season. Heyman was allowed to play in non-conference games, and the ACC Tournament. However, Duke failed to make the postseason, despite Heyman being voted the tournament's outstanding player, losing the ACC Tournament final to the Wake Forest Demon Deacons and their All American Len Chappell, 96‚Äì81. At the time, only the league champion was admitted to the NCAA Tournament, and league rules prohibited ACC teams from playing in the NIT Tournament. Heyman finished the season averaging 25 points and nearly 11 rebounds per game, and despite his suspension, Heyman was voted to the All-ACC basketball first team. He also won numerous national plaudits, being named to the UPI and AP Third- Team All American squad. In 1962, Heyman's junior year, he again had a great year (scoring 25.3 points per game, and averaging over 11 rebounds per game) but Duke failed to make the post season, being upset by the Clemson Tigers in the ACC Tournament semi-final. Heyman was once again voted to the All-ACC Basketball first team, and the AP and UPI Second Team All-American squad. Clemson However, during Heyman's 1963 senior year, Heyman unleashed his best season yet. Duke won the regular season conference title, but to make the NCAA tournament, they would have to win the ACC Tournament. Their first game was against 8th seed Virginia, a game in which the Blue Devils won handily, 89‚Äì79. In the tournament semi finals, the Blue Devils defeated the North Carolina State Wolfpack, 82‚Äì65. In the final, they had a chance to get revenge for the 1961 tournament final loss, as they faced off against Wake Forest. Heyman and Duke avenged that 1961 loss, defeating the Demon Deacons 68‚Äì57, earning the Blue Devils the right to play in the 1963 NCAA Tournament. The Blue Devils were given a bye to play in the round of 16, and they defeated New York University, who had Happy Hairston and Barry Kramer, 81-76 in the East regional semi-finals, with Heyman scoring 22 points, and adding 13 rebounds. In the East Regional final, Heyman (16 points, 10 rebounds, 3 assists) and the Blue Devils defeated Saint Joseph's University, 73‚Äì59, to advance to the Final Four for the first time in school history. Despite Heyman's 29 points and 12 rebounds in the semi-finals, the Blue Devils succumbed 94-75 to eventual national champion Loyola of Chicago (who had All-American Jerry Harkness). In the consolation game, Heyman completed his college career when Duke defeated Oregon State (who had Heisman Trophy winner Terry Baker) 85-63. In this game, Heyman scored 22 points, and added seven rebounds. Art Heyman was also named MVP of the 1963 NCAA tournament, even though Duke finished third. Heyman again won the plaudits of the sportswriters, winning the AP National Player of the Year award, the ACC Player of the Year award, and the Oscar Robertson Trophy. Heyman averaged 25.1 points per game and scoring 1,984 points while at Duke University, which were both school records at that time. Heyman is one of three athletes in ACC History to have been elected unanimously to the All-ACC Men's Basketball team three times, along with David Thompson and Tyler Hansbrough. Professional career Heyman's success in college led to him being selected first in the 1963 NBA draft by the New York Knicks. During his first season with the team, he averaged 15.4 points per game and made the NBA All-Rookie Team. However, his mercurial temper and frequent outbursts saw his playing time with the Knicks decreased during his second year, and his scoring average dropped to 5.7 points per game. Heyman parted ways with New York in 1965, and after brief stints with the Cincinnati Royals and Philadelphia 76ers, he left the NBA for the Hartford Capitols of the Eastern Professional Basketball League in 1966. When the American Basketball Association formed in 1967, Heyman signed with the New Jersey Americans. He played in the ABA for the next three seasons with the Americans, Pittsburgh Pipers, Minnesota Pipers and Miami Floridians, winning a league championship with the Pittsburgh Pipers in 1968 as he averaged over 20 points a game. Post-basketball career Heyman retired from professional basketball in 1970 with 4,030 combined NBA/ABA points. He was inducted into the Duke Sports Hall of Fame, the Helms Sports Hall of Fame, the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, and the Nassau High School Hall of Fame. His Duke jersey number #25 was not retired until 1990, after years of resentment from Heyman. In 1996, he opened Tracy J's Watering Hole in Manhattan, New York. Heyman died at age 71 on August 27, 2012 in Clermont, Florida.

Writing career  As a writer, Cohen published a wide variety of theatre texts, including Acting One, Acting Two, Acting Power, Acting Professionally: Raw Facts about Careers in Acting, and his latest text, Acting Power: the 21st Century Edition, most of which are used in colleges, universities, and conservatories around the world; some having been translated into Hungarian, Romanian, Finnish, Estonian, Chinese and Korean. His texts explain and demonstrate a system of acting and theatre analysis called GOTE, as well as presenting a series of theatre exercises ranging from beginner to advanced. Cohen's Theatre, now in its eleventh edition, has become one of the leading texts on the history of world theatre. Reviewing this book, the \\"Revue d'histoire du theatre\\" noted that: \\"[The Theatre] was written in a very clear fashion and an elegant and compelling style,‚Ä¶ makes for a document that should be found in every library.\\"Revue d'histoire du theatre, March, 2002. Cohen's other books include Jean Giraudoux: Three Faces of Destiny, a study of the French playwright; Creative Play Direction, Working Together in Theatre: Collaboration and Leadership, More Power To You; his 2014 autobiography, Falling Into Theatre...and Finding Myself, Acting in Shakespeare, and his 2015 Shakespeare on Theatre, plus more than three dozen journal articles and four hundred play reviews. Most of his reviews are in the London-published Plays International, while his essays have appeared in Theatre Journal, Theatre Topics, Theatre Forum, Theatre Survey, Modern Drama, Theater der Zeit, Essays in Theatre, On Stage Studies, The Drama Review, Contemporary Literature, Contemporary Literary Criticism, Slavic and East European Performance, Experiment and Innovation, Dramatics, Alternatives Th√©√¢trales, and Dramatic Theory and Criticism. Cohen's play, Machiavelli: the art of terror (formerly The Prince), published by Dramatic Publishing Company and in Romania and the U.K., has been professionally produced in Los Angeles, Long Beach, Pittsburgh, the Madach Theatre in Budapest and the National Romanian Theatre in Cluj, and in staged readings in New York and Los Angeles. His The Moebius Strip premiered at the National Romanian Theatre in Cluj in 2013-16, and his Bzaap! premiered with the Transversal Theatre Company in Amsterdam in 2014 and the National Romanian Theatre in Cluj in 2016. His dramatic translations (The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Misanthrope, Clizia, and Tibi's Law), and his opera translations (The Magic Flute, Carmen) have been both produced and published widely.

Career Rounseville was born in Attleboro, Massachusetts. He made his Broadway debut in a small role in the Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart musical Babes in Arms, then appeared in other musicals in the chorus. Between 1943 and 1945, Rounseville was billed as Robert Field, using his middle name as a surname. He again played small roles on Broadway, in a revival of The Merry Widow and in Up in Central Park. Rounseville appeared several times on television, as well as in two films. He is perhaps best known to opera buffs for starring in the role of Hoffmann in Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger's film of Jacques Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann (1951), the first color film of an opera to use genuinely cinematic techniques (as opposed to filming a performance on stage).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044103/ That same year, he was also the first Tom Rakewell, in the world premiere of Igor Stravinsky's opera The Rake's Progress, onstage at La Fenice. He was fortunate to have as his co- stars Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Jennie Tourel.http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=204845 In October 1951 he portrayed Channon in the world premiere of David Tamkin's The Dybbuk at the New York City Opera with Patricia Neway portraying his love interest. In 1956, Rounseville played both his best remembered screen role and one of his most memorable stage roles. In the film Carousel, an adaptation of the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical, he portrayed the snobbish fisherman Mr. Snow, opposite Barbara Ruick as Carrie Pipperidge.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049055/ In December of that year, he opened on Broadway in the original production of Leonard Bernstein's Candide, playing the title role opposite Barbara Cook as Cunegonde.http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2591 In 1960, he appeared in the role of Nanki-Poo in a \\"Bell Telephone Hour\\" television abridgement of Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta The Mikado, starring Groucho Marx as Ko-Ko, the executioner.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221399/ He was also an occasional guest star on the TV version of the musical series \\"The Voice of Firestone\\".http://www.radiogoldindex.com/cgi- local/p3.cgi?ArtistName=Rounseville,+Robert&ArtistNumber;=33502 On television's NBC Opera Theatre, he sang the role of Don Jose in an English- language version of Carmen (1953) and the Chevalier de la Force in the first American television production (also in English) of Dialogues of the Carmelites (1957).https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0745786/ Soprano Leontyne Price made an early television appearance in the latter work. In 1969, he starred on National Educational Television in the American premiere of Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's last opera From the House of the Dead, based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1206305/ Rounseville also made a few studio cast recordings of Broadway shows. Among them was a 1952 mono LP - the most complete one made up to that time - of Sigmund Romberg's operetta The Student Prince, in which he starred with Dorothy Kirsten. It went out of print for a very long while, but has since been reissued on CD.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005YGLD Most frequently, Rounseville appeared in modest revivals of operettas and musicals at the New York City Center, in shows such as Brigadoon (as Charlie Dalrymple) http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2625 and Show Boat (as Gaylord Ravenal).http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=477951 But in 1965, he returned in a major Broadway production, when he appeared as The Padre in the original stage version of Man of La Mancha,http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=4727 a role he reprised in the 1972 revival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3548 During the last years of his life, Rounseville attended meetings of the NYC founding chapter of \\"The Sons of the Desert\\", where he performed for the club's members and enjoyed watching the film comedies of Laurel & Hardy. He was a lifelong friend of Florence Louise Pettitt, an opera conductor from his home town in Massachusetts. Rounseville died quite suddenly in 1974.

The album was recorded in 1993 at Brock's own Barking Dog Studios, produced with Paul Cobbold. The title track \\"It Is the Business of the Future to Be Dangerous\\" is a quote from the mathematician/philosopher Alfred Whitehead's Science and the Modern World, which had originally been used on the sleeve notes to the Space Ritual album (\\"It is the business of the future to be dangerous; and it is among the merits of science that it equips the future for its duties\\").

The island is approximately long by wide, and it is located at . Overview The island has long been claimed by both Brazil and Uruguay.

Uruguayan officials claim that the island is part of their municipality of Bella Uni√≥n, in Artigas Department.....uncontested dispute (between Brazil and Uruguay) over certain islands in the Quarai/Cuareim.....and the resulting tripoint with Argentina However, neither country has shown interest in actively enforcing its claims to the island, for example by sending troops there. Like the other territorial dispute between Brazil and Uruguay in the vicinity of Masoller, it has not prevented close and friendly diplomatic and economic ties between the two countries. From 1964 to 2011, the island had a single house and a single inhabitant, a Brazilian farmer called Jos√© Jorge Daniel. In 2011, suffering from health problems, Mr. Daniel moved out of the island to live with relatives in the nearby city of Uruguaiana, Brazil, where he died shortly afterwards, aged 93 or 95 (sources differ). Since then, the island has been uninhabited and unoccupied. On 7 August 2009, the island suffered severe damage by a fire caused by unknown reasons (though arson was suspected), which burned at least 40% of the island's area. The fire was eventually put out by a joint transnational effort by the firefighters from Barra do Quara√≠ and Bella Uni√≥n. Mr. Daniel, who still lived there at the time, and his house were unscathed. Since then, teams of biologists and students from nearby Brazilian universities, supported by Brazilian and Uruguayan ecological NGOs, have gone on occasional expeditions to the island to study the fire damage to local wildlife and try to restore its former ecosystem.

Justice Kinser was elected by the Virginia General Assembly to her first 12-year term to the Virginia Supreme Court in 1998, after being appointed by Governor George Allen to fill a 1997 vacancy. Justice Kinser was elected to a second 12-year term during the 2010 session of the General Assembly. Justice Kinser became Chief Justice of the Virginia Supreme Court on February 1, 2011. She is the first woman to hold the office of Chief Justice on the Court. Biography Justice Kinser received her bachelor's degree with honors from the University of Tennessee in 1974, and her law degree from the University of Virginia in 1977. Prior to being appointed to the Supreme Court by then-Governor George Felix Allen, Kinser served, along with Allen, as law clerk to U.S. District Judge Glen M. Williams, Western District of Virginia from 1977 to 1978. Allen and Kinser had also been law school classmates. She then entered lawyer private practice from 1978 to 1979 and served as Commonwealth's Attorney for Lee County, Virginia from 1980 to 1984. She returned to private practice from 1984 to 1990. She served as a U.S. magistrate judge, Western District of Virginia from 1990 to 1997. She succeeded Justice Roscoe B. Stephenson, Jr.. At the ceremony announcing her appointment, Governor Allen said of Justice Kinser, \\"She believes the purpose of judges is to interpret law, not to make it.\\" Kinser, in her remarks, responded, \\"It is for the legislature to pass laws and, as a judge, it is not for me to agree or disagree but to apply the law to the facts of a case.\\" Following news of her appointment, Clifton \\"Chip\\" Woodrum, a Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates, said that, though he was not familiar with Kinser's credentials. \\"Given the source, I would assume that she's no screaming liberal, and that she reflects Governor Allen's point of view.\\" According to news reports at the time of her appointment, Kinser's motto is \\"To make the best better\\" from 4-H, the youth agricultural organization in which she was active. Kinser retired from the Supreme Court at the end of 2014. On May 5, 2015, Kinser began a position as Senior Counsel with the Roanoke-based law firm Gentry Locke Rakes & Moore, LLP.

This can lead to wheelslip when the train is taking power, and wheelslide when the train is braking. The most common cause of contamination is fallen moist leaves that lie on and cling to the top surface of the rails of railway tracks. The condition results in significant reduction in friction between train wheels and rails, and in extreme cases can render the track temporarily unusable. In Britain, the situation is colloquially referred to as \\"leaves on the line\\". Low adhesion caused by weather Railhead contamination caused by weather conditions can occur at any time of year. The leaf fall season causes the most disruption to rail operations. In heavily deciduous forested areas like the American Mid-Atlantic states, New England, many parts of Europe including the UK, and Southern Ontario, Canada the problem can arise. Where the leaves fall onto a railway route, some collect on the railhead and are then heavily compressed by trains into a slippery low- friction coating on the rail and on the wheel treads. If the climate is damp, the wet leaves adhere to the rail very effectively. The draft caused by the passage of the train causes nearby leaves to be caught up in air currents, and more leaves are deposited on the railhead. The build-up of this material is incremental, and it is hard enough not to be quickly worn away by the ordinary passage of trains. Winter can provide problems of low adhesion when snow and ice are deposited on running lines. Just as with road vehicles, black ice can cause trains to encounter difficulty when starting away, or can initiate wheel slide during braking. Even summer can have its problems. A light rain shower following a long period of dry weather can sometimes cause similar low adhesion conditions to those of leaf fall contamination. Although the effect is only short term, its unpredictability can cause a significant incident to occur. A morning dew can have the same effect. Disc brakes add to the problem Before about 1960, most railway vehicles used brake shoes to stop the train by applying pressure on the wheel treads. Since then, disc brakes have increasingly been used, which means that cleaning the compressed leaf material from the wheel tread by abrasion no longer occurs. Lack of lineside maintenance In the steam locomotive era, trees and other lineside vegetation would be regularly cut back to reduce the risk of their being ignited by sparks from the locomotive. As the railways ceased to use steam traction, this maintenance was allowed to lapse, and the resulting extra growth increases the supply of leaves thereby exacerbating the problem. Low adhesion caused by crushed insects There are many substances which can cause low adhesion when they are deposited on the railhead. In Victoria, Australia, train wheels crushing plagues of introduced Portuguese millipedes which were crossing the tracks, caused passenger rail operator V/Line to be penalised more than $700,000 for cancellations and poor punctuality in one quarter of 2001. In 2009, railway tracks at Tallarook in central Victoria were also affected by a Portuguese millipede plague, causing several trains to be cancelled. The crushing of Portuguese millipedes is suspected to have caused a crash between two trains at Clarkson near Perth, Western Australia, in September 2013. Slippery rails caused by caterpillars were reported in Queensland in 1938. Crushed locusts affected train operations on the Otavi Mining and Railway Company in South-West Africa (modern Namibia) in 1924. Effects Flat spot The loss of friction between wheels and rail results in loss of tractive force ‚Äî the wheels begin to spin, and in some instances the train is unable to move. In braking, substantial loss of friction results in reduced braking force. Braking distances are considerably longer, and in extreme cases the wheels may even lock up, causing the train to slide. Modern locomotives and multiple units are equipped with Wheel slide protection to counter slippery rail conditions. Locked wheels can self-grind flat spots on the steel tyres, especially if the wheels are still sliding when arriving at a non-greasy section of rail, e.g. one that has previously been sanded. This causes the wheels to go out of profile (known colloquially as 'wheel flats'), which subsequently leads to severe vibration and the need for the wheels to be re-profiled or re-tyred at great expense. In extreme cases, the build-up of leaf material can electrically insulate the wheels from the rails, resulting in a failure of signalling equipment to detect the presence of the train. Where the problem is severe, Track Circuit Actuators fitted to trains can help alleviate the problem. In the United Kingdom, it was estimated that the autumn leaves problem cost the rail industry GBP 60 million (USD 115 million) a year. Mitigation measures Railhead treatment A Long Island Rail Road work train pressure-washes the rail before applying a traction gel. Treatment measures generally involve some system to jet or blast the accumulated deposit away, or to coat it with a high-friction material. Blasting is usually carried out with water jets, often in combination with mechanical scrubbing apparatus. The coating method usually involves depositing sand in a paste on to the rail; as the sand may exacerbate the risk of unwanted insulation, the sand mix sometimes contains metal particles. The coating is applied from special trains (colloquially referred to as \\"Sandite trains\\" after the original proprietary mixture applied) and in some cases locally by hand applicators. Lineside- fitted Traction gel applicators which apply liquid to the railhead as a train passes are fitted at sites where significant low adhesion regularly occurs, such as on the approach to stations. Both of these processes are effective for a limited duration; the jetting method is ineffective as soon as the next leaf falls; the sand deposition method is more durable, although rainfall usually removes the deposited sand quickly. Another method is using a high voltage electrical spark or plasma to volatilize the deposited material, but this method has only been used experimentally, as it is hindered by high power consumption, noise and rail degradation. Sanders Locomotives and Multiple units are fitted with sanders which apply a fine layer of dry sand on the railhead. This assists adhesion during braking and acceleration. Wheel slide protection Wheel slide protection (WSP) equipment is fitted to passenger trains to manage the behaviour of wheel sets in low adhesion conditions. When the train is braking, it behaves like the ABS system in cars by releasing the brake on any axle if it detects that it is locking up. WSP can also control the traction system to prevent wheel spin when applying power. Driving technique Where trains have difficulty stopping during low adhesion conditions the greatest risk is of passing a signal at danger or 'over running' a station. At these times train drivers adopt 'defensive driving', which involves braking earlier and more gently than usual. Also, less power is applied when starting trains. Prior to each leaf fall season, many train companies arrange low adhesion training for their newly qualified drivers. This consists of taking over a section of line during a quiet period. Using lineside markers each driver gets his train up to speed and then makes a Full Service brake under normal adhesion conditions. The railhead is then treated with a contaminant that has a low coefficient of friction. On the second run, the driver will experience the sound and sensation of the train sliding, and the stopping distance will be considerably greater. Although this only provides an approximation of how a train will behave during low adhesion, it does ensure that the driver can recognize the onset of wheel slide and will know the correct actions to take when it occurs. In the UK, some passenger train operating companies publish a special 'leaf fall' timetable to allow for the additional time that lighter braking and acceleration take. Communication Any information about the location and severity of low adhesion conditions will give train drivers warning of problems. In the UK there are several sources; * Regular blackspots, known as Areas of known low adhesion are published in the Sectional Appendix and form part of the drivers' Route Knowledge which they are examined on. * Lineside signs showing the start and end of known regular low adhesion areas are provided at some locations. * Drivers are required by the Rulebook, to report to the signaller immediately either, any low railhead adhesion at a location not published in the Sectional Appendix, or any exceptionally poor rail adhesion at locations which are published in the Sectional Appendix. * After receiving a report of low adhesion conditions, the signaller will contact drivers of following trains by radio to warn them. If it is safe to do so, the signaller may tell a driver to carry out a controlled test stop. That driver will then stop the train using the brake force appropriate to normal conditions for the weather and conditions at that time of year, and report back to the signaller. Vegetation management Removal of deciduous trees at the lineside is a management method to control the problem; however, there is political resistance to this in populous areas.  North America  Slippery rail has created severe disruptions of rail service, particularly in major metropolitan areas such as New York or Boston. In November 2006, it was blamed for roughly one-third of all Metro-North Railroad's Hudson and Harlem lines' passenger cars being taken out of service. During the same period on the Long Island Rail Road, nearly 25% of cars were out of service due to slippery rail. In the US, Amtrak, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, southeastern Pennsylvania's SEPTA, Chicago's commuter rail service Metra, and MARC, which serves Baltimore and Washington, D.C., have all reported delays due to slippery rail. Methods for dealing with slippery rail have included trimming trees, the release of sand on the train wheels for traction, high-pressure water blasting and, most expensively, the use of high-powered laser blasts to clear the rails of leaves. Metro-North has designed a system dubbed \\"Waterworld\\", which is a large flat rail car that blasts the rails with high- pressure water jets as the car moves over it. New Jersey Transit has used a similar method, which has proven effective. The device it uses is called \\"Aqua-Track\\" which, while attached to a moving rail car, sprays water at a pressure of on to the part of the rail where the leaves cling. Since this system was introduced in 2002, the delays due to wheelslip have been reduced by over 60%. SEPTA Regional Rail's method of preventing slippery rail is the Gel Trains. These three trains spray a high-pressure mixture of Sandite on the rails; in the fall, the Gel Trains also clean the rails using the high- pressure water jet method ahead of the gel application. These trains consist of a pressure washer and gel dispenser mounted on a converted flatcar, and a tank car which carries water. They are pulled on one end by one of SEPTA's work diesels (or a diesel borrowed from a local shortline such as the West Chester Railroad), and controlled at the other end by a former LIRR \\"Power Pack\\" cab unit (one a former ALCO FA, the other a former EMD F7). However, as of 2015; The FA and F7 were retired and replaced by Comet 1 cab cars.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, a number of rail companies change their timings and publish special \\"leaf fall timetables\\". During autumn, a fleet of Railhead Treatment Trains (RHTT) run across the network using high pressure water-jetting to clean the railhead. These trains are timetabled to run between scheduled daytime services as well as during the night when less rail activity can allow the railhead contamination to build up. The cryptic nature of rail company explanations for slippery rail and related phenomena made the phrase \\"leaves on the line\\" a standing joke, and, along with variants such as \\"the wrong type of snow\\", is seen by members of the public who are not familiar with the problem as an excuse for poor service. Particularly problematic local trees include the sycamore, lime, sweet and horse chestnut, ash, and poplar, which regrow or coppice after cutting back, and have large, flat leaves, which stick to the line and cause severe slippery rail. Other types of tree that cause problems are quick-growing, pioneering trees, or those producing a substantial amount of leaves. Poplars are particularly troubling because they tend to shed limbs. A term current in 2003 for cutting down or cutting back trees near the lines was \\"lineside vegetation management\\". Netherlands Slippery rail is also a problem in the Netherlands, addressed by Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) and ProRail.Article, International Railway Journal, October 2003 To prevent wheel lock, on some routes trains are required to brake earlier and accelerate more slowly. Furthermore, some (passenger) trains are fitted with equipment to apply Sandite gel on the tracks.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhYEREMr1Oo In autumn 2016, nearly of this gel was applied on the Dutch railway network. In the fall of 2014 a pilot, in collaboration with Delft University of Technology, to use lasers to remove contaminations was announced by NS and ProRail.

The railroad's tracks connected Duke to connections with the BNSF Railway, Farmrail and Wichita, Tillman and Jackson Railway at Altus, Oklahoma.  History  The H&E; line was originally constructed by the Altus, Wichita Falls & Hollis Railway and the Wichita Falls & Northwestern Railway in 1912. Both of these predecessor railroads were part of the \\"Wichita Falls Route\\" and were soon purchased by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad (MKT). The Hollis & Eastern was incorporated on October 15, 1958, beginning operations on the former MKT Wellington branch between Altus and Hollis on May 15, 1959. The line west of Hollis to Wellington, Texas was abandoned at that time and sold for scrap and never operated by the H&E.; The railroad was purchased by Republic Gypsum Company in 1971 which later abandoned the section between Hollis, Gould and Duke in 1975. Republic Gypsum later sold the plant to American Gypsum in 1998. Primary commodities handled on the H&E; include wallboard (sheet rock) originating from the Republic (later American) Gypsum plant in Duke and wheat shipped from elevators at Duke and Victory. The H&E; interchanges with the Wichita, Tillman & Jackson (WTJ) at Welon Yard, with Farmrail (also at Welon) and with the Stillwater Central and BNSF in Altus. Because of a slowed economy and increased sales of Chinese wallboard being imported into the United States, American Gypsum decided in 2009 to end its own operations of the H&E; and to lease the line to another carrier. Bids were received in early 2010 and Stillwater Central Railroad was chosen as the new rail operator. Independent operations of the H&E; were scheduled to be taken over by Stillwater Central effective April 5, 2010 with the H&E; last day as an independent carrier taking place on Easter Sunday, April 4, 2010. The last official H&E; train operated between Altus and Duke on Thursday, April 1, 2010.

The base was hit during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and later served as the hub for all Marine aviation units heading into combat in the Pacific Theater during World War II. The base was closed in 1952 because its runways were too short for jet aircraft, and expansion was impossible due to the proximity of Naval Air Station Barbers Point. Ewa has been abandoned since 1952; however, two of its runways are still visible from the air and many of the revetments still remain in good condition. History SBD from VMSB-232 at Ewa, 7 December 1941. Covered concrete revetments at Ewa It was founded as an airship base for the United States Navy in 1925, but no airships ever landed there. The USS Shenandoah crashed in Ohio in 1925, the USS Akron was destroyed in 1933 and the USS Macon in 1935, leading to the cancellation of the airship program. The base's upgrade to an air station began in September 1940, and on February 3, 1941 it was commissioned Marine Corps Air Station Ewa. By the onset of World War II, the air station had four runways and numerous hangars. On December 7, 1941, MCAS Ewa was the first installation hit during the attack on Pearl Harbor. All forty-eight aircraft based there were destroyed, although the runway was not bombed and remained serviceable. During the attack, an Aichi D3A dive bomber was shot down by pilots George Welch and Kenneth Taylor in their P-40s above the Station. In April 1944, the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing was relocated to MCAS Ewa where they stayed for the remainder of the war. The start of the Korean War saw another surge in activity at MCAS Ewa, but because the runways were becoming more and more unsuitable for jet aircraft, the Marine Corps shifted its aviation assets to Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay. Ewa was officially closed on June 18, 1952 and its property assumed by Naval Air Station Barbers Point. Redevelopment In 2008, the US Navy announced they would be leasing of the old air station to Ford Island Properties, who plan on building expensive homes and shopping centers to create an urban center for Kapolei. The Navy has said that 4 to of the base near the center of the old runways qualifies for the National Register of Historic Places. While some local looking to preserve the field are trying to rally support to make it a National Cemetery. The Navy and Ford Island Properties were expected to conclude their lease agreement in August 2008. In 2013 the Honolulu City Council moved forwards on a plan to have a road built over the airfield.\\"Developers have WWII airfield in their sights.\\" In 2018 The Louis Berger company was commissioned by Hunt Development Corp (Ford Island properties) to provide an Ewa Battlefield preservation plan.

History First Presbyterian Church was formed as the Presbyterian Church in Chattanooga on June 21, 1840, under the leadership of missionaries who had previously served at the Brainerd Mission to the Cherokee. After the \\"Trail of Tears\\" the missionaries returned to Chattanooga and began to work among the English, Scots-Irish, and Welsh in the community and helped plant the new church. At first, the congregation worshiped in a log cabin. Its first purpose-built church, completed in 1845, was on the west side of Walnut Street near Third Street. That building was the home of First Presbyterian until the mid-1850s, when it was replaced by a new brick church building on the northeast corner of Seventh and Market streets. During the Union Army occupation of Chattanooga in 1863, that church was stripped to serve as a military hospital. For a period after the Civil War, worship services were held in the minister's home. Through the years, the congregation grew. It adopted the \\"First Presbyterian\\" name in 1871, when Second Presbyterian Church was organized. From the 1880s until 1910, when its current building was opened, First Presbyterian was located at the southwest corner of Georgia Avenue and Seventh Street. There have been thirteen pastors of the church including notable clergy such as Thomas McCallie (whose sons founded The McCallie School), Jonathan Bachman (former Confederate chaplain, former Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, 1910), James Fowle, and Ben Haden. Michael A. Milton served the church from 2001 to 2008, when he became president and professor of practical theology at Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Reverend Michael Preg served as the interim pastor before the church called its current senior minister, the Reverend Timothy Tinsley. First Presbyterian minister Joseph Glass Venable, who served the church from 1924 until his death in 1928, was the first minister to preach a worship service on a local radio station. A congregation history states that the program series he initiated \\"is believed to be the longest continuing radio program in the United States\\". One of his successors, Ben Haden, who served First Presbyterian from 1967 to 1999, was later to inaugurate the long-running radio ministry \\"Changed Lives\\" on WFLI in Chattanooga. Church building The church building was designed by notable architect Stanford White and was built in 1910 at a cost of $152,000. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in December 2009. A centennial dedication of the sanctuary was held on December 18, 2010. Pastors or representatives of deceased pastors each spoke during the service of dedication. Missions The congregation has sponsored other local congregations in Chattanooga and in other parts of the United States. The congregation has a history of support for foreign missions and is active today, through partnerships with other churches and agencies, in numerous parts of the world. The church sponsors a year-round camp and conference center, Camp Vesper Point. It supports 63 missionaries, 5 church planting partnerships in 31 countries.

Though the monastery is no longer used for services, the complex is well preserved. There are 4 churches, a gavit (narthex) that serves the two largest of the churches, and other buildings which served secondary roles. At one time there used to be vast settlements around Makaravank, the presence of which was of great importance for the growth of the monastery. History The oldest church of the group was built during the 10th and 11th centuries. The materials used in its construction were mostly large pieces of roughly hewn red tufa (a common Armenian building material). One of the churches, named Surb Astvatsatsin church, was built in 1198 in white stone, on the eastern side of the complex. Surb Astvatsatsin is attributed to Hovhannes. The main church was built in 1205, using pink andesite, with a red andesite gavit. Complex The monastery was surrounded with walls, its gate was decorated with columns. Numerous residential structures were situated in the enclosed territory. Among them were architectural pavilions housing mineral springs. Makaravank‚Äôs structures are built of dark-pink andesite and red tufa, with occasional greenish stones. There are also remnants of a fence, and a spring/well of the 12th or 13th century outside of the walls where a picnic area is now located. Main temple Detail below altar Passing through the gate in the circuit wall, the main church of 1205, built by Vardan, son of Prince Bazaz, is on the right. The main temple is a domed hall. The diameter of the high dome is quite large, and the under-dome space predominates in the structures interior. The vertical orientation of the interior is emphasized by the pillars supporting the dome. Attached to the pillars are several faceted pilasters and half-columns which form, at the top, semi-circular and pointed arches bearing the supporting girth of the domes. High niches, semi-circular in the plan, framed with graceful arcatures on twin half-columns, which decorate the bottom of the altar apses, harmoniously fit in with the pillars. The walls of altar daises, decorated with geometrical ornaments, are of extraordinary interest. In Makaravank the profiled eight-pointed stars and octagons between them, arranged in two rows, are covered with varied and rich carving unique in the architecture of medieval Armenia. It features various floral motifs, making up unusual bouquets, all kinds of fishes and birds, as well as sphinxes and sirens. Of interest are a boatman looking ahead, and a man‚Äôs figure, placed inside an octagon up the left edge of the altar dais wall and inscribed \\"eritasard\\" - probably a self-portrait of the carver. All this is enclosed in a strongly profiled frame which draws the onlooker‚Äôs attention to the reliefs inside it. The exterior decoration of Makaravank‚Äôs main temple is the more expressive. Over the central window of the southern fa√ßade there is a sun dial and below it, on the cantilever column, a representation of a dove; the round windows vary in their shapes and ornamentation. The entrance portals are rectangular, with a semi-circular inner niche. The tympanum and the spandrel are composed of stones of various shapes and colors. The dome drum is skirted by a graceful twenty-arch arcature on twin half-columns. The arches are made as an ornamental band; the same band passes between the arches and the cornice. The arcature is harmoniously proportionate to the dome and to the overall volume of the church. Gavit Detail above gavit portal Passing through the gate in the circuit wall, the gavit is on the left. The facade of the gavit, which was built with a donation from Prince Vache I Vachutian in 1224, bears sculptures of a sphinx and a lion attacking a bull. Inside the gavit, one reaches the earliest church, of the 10th or 11th century. The narthex is four-columned. Built before 1207, the it catered to both temples at the same time. It contains a door which led to the communion bread bakery, a small vaulted room. The decoration of the narthex is subordinated to the artistic features of the main temple, which shows especially clearly in ornamental carving. The western portal has, like that of Geghard narthex, a stepped framing which includes the window above. Bas- reliefs are carved on the middle ledge, at the sides of the window. At the right side there is a winged sphinx with a crown on its head, and at the left side a lion attacking an ox. The shaft of the south-western column of the interior is girdled with an eight-arch arcature, the capital is accentuated, on the transversal axis, by a large rosette above which, on the face of the arch, there is a relief representation of a dove with a lifted wing. The abutment on the western side, corresponding to the column, has smaller vertical divisions than the other wall-attached abutments. Rosettes of various designs, painted white, yellow and red, were cut on the flat ceilings of the corner sections. The decoration of the central section was richer. Floral ornaments covering the shield-shaped pendentives show birds in various attitudes. The girth of transition to the 20-hedral base of the ceiling which probably consisted of six intersecting arches is composed of groove-divided triangular slabs, vertical and inclined. Surb Astvatsatsin church Small round chapel Outside of these is a small Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) church attributed to Abbot Hovhannes in 1198 in memory of his parents and brothers, with sculpted a portal. The church is a miniature building, which belongs to the type of the four-apse centric round monuments of the 10th to 13th centuries such as the church of St. Gregory in Sanahin. But as distinct from them the church of Astvatsatsin is round only in its lower part and octahedral in its upper part, with four triangular niches crowned with various conchs. The dome is proportionate to the lower round bulk. The decoration of the church is in stylistic harmony with that of the main temple and the narthex. The profiled girth skirting the building passes across the ends of the niches and the window openings. On the northern side there are eye- catching reliefs of a stork and a snake, and over the southern window a scene showing two beasts locked in a fight. Other structures The most ancient structure of all is Makaravank‚Äôs 10th-century cross-winged domed church with annexes in the corners, which differs from the ordinary structures of this type by rich carved ornamentation (floral and interlaced linear) on the wall of the altar dais and on the framings of the main windows of the interior. The small chapels built of ashlar stones have carved door platbands. Makaravank‚Äôs chapel has a vaulted ceiling.

Esposito was born in Acerra, Italy, and later joined one of the street gangs terrorizing Chicago's Little Italy during the early 1900s. When the Volstead Act (National Prohibition Act of 1919) was enacted, Esposito's organization, the 42 Gang, which included Sam \\"Momo\\" Giancana and Paul \\"The Waiter\\" Ricca, quickly entered into bootlegging. Esposito's early success with the Genna Brothers may have been a factor in the 1920 murder of rival James \\"Big Jim\\" Colosimo, a long time racketeer who had been hesitant to begin his own bootlegging operations. By the early 1920s, Esposito had become a Republican ward boss of the 19th Ward in Chicago, one of the earliest Italian-Americans to be elected to this job. Esposito provided political protection to the bootlegging gangs of Little Italy, including the South Side gang of mob boss Johnny Torrio and the Gennas. In May 1921, Esposito joined city officials and organized crime figures at the funerals of his political protegee Antonio D'Andrea, shot to death shortly after leaving his Neapolitan Restaurant. Several years later, Esposito attended the funeral of another ally, Angelo Genna murdered on May 25, 1925. at crimemagazine.com Esposito's cousin, Frank DeLaurentis, was also killed during the bootleg wars when he and John Tuccello were caught by members of the Joe Saltis-Frank McErlane organization attempting to supply bootleg liquor to a 51st Street saloon on behalf of the Sheldon Gang on April 15, 1926. In later years, Esposito became a political rival of Chicago Outfit boss Al Capone. On March 21, 1928, Esposito was attacked and killed in a drive-by shooting on his front steps, with his two nieces right inside the house. References *Kelly, Robert J.

Cook III is an American film director and cartoon creator, best known for creating, directing and producing the animated series 2 Stupid Dogs and directing the Disney animated features Return to Never Land and Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers. Donovan Cook was born in Berkeley, California in 1968, and moved to San Diego when he was 14. He graduated from the California Institute of the Arts in 1990 and has worked on several different Disney animated movies, such as The Little Mermaid and the Mickey Mouse adaptation of The Prince and the Pauper. In 1993, he created the Emmy- nominated TV series 2 Stupid Dogs for Hanna-Barbera. The style he revived in 2 Stupid Dogs has been emulated and copied numerous times since. He gained the idea from two stray dogs roaming in his apartment and tried to sell it when Hanna-Barbera bought it. Secret Squirrel was one of his favorite HB cartoons which he watched in the 70s, which influenced him to revive the series as Super Secret Secret Squirrel. Cook then returned to Disney in 1997, where he developed and produced the series Nightmare Ned. In 1998, he returned to feature animation when he co-directed Return to Never Land for Disney. In 2001, he took on the challenge of directing the first feature-length film of Mickey Mouse series characters Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck (Goofy had previously appeared in A Goofy Movie and its sequel). The film, Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers, premiered worldwide on DVD in 2004. He also served as a director for Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and The Adventures of Kid Danger, and was an assistant director for The Ren & Stimpy Show. Cook was originally scheduled to co-direct the film Space Chimps, but he would be subsequently scrapped from the project. His latest project was the low-budget indie film Rideshare: The Movie, the first film ever to be shot on the iPhone 4. It was released on April 12, 2011 on the Buffalo Niagara Film Festival, being subsequently shown on the Honolulu Film Awards. It has won positive reviews.

Built originally to serve the British Armed Forces, it now houses the Hong Kong garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Ground Force. It has also been used as Kai Chi Children's Centre and the Aberdeen Rehabilitation Centre. History The fort, which occupied a site of 128 hectares, was founded in 1841 on the Stanley Peninsula at the southern side of Hong Kong Island. It had barracks and officers quarters. Coastal artillery batteries protected Victoria Harbour. During the Battle of Hong Kong in December 1941, the fort was where British and Canadian troops mounted a final last stand. The survivors were the first Commonwealth troops to surrender to Japanese forces. The fallen servicemen were buried in the nearby Stanley Military Cemetery. The fort then became an internment camp for the remainder of the Second World War. In the late 1940s, Stanley Fort reverted to its former purpose as a British Army barracks. By the early 1950s the fort was base of the 27th Heavy Anti- aircraft Regiment and a small workshop operated by the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. The fort had three-storied barracks, a two-storey NAAFI, medical facilities and a Company HQ building. It also had a parade ground and vehicle and equipment park.

The Ottawa Rough Riders defeated the Saskatchewan Roughriders 23‚Äì20 in what is considered one of the most thrilling Grey Cup games, featuring some of the most exciting plays in Grey Cup history. The attendance was 53,467‚Äîat the time, a Grey Cup record‚Äîdue to the recently completed stadium reconfiguration to accommodate the Toronto Blue Jays, a Major League Baseball expansion team that commenced play the following year. Toronto's Grey Cup attendance record would last but one season before being broken by the 65th Grey Cup at Olympic Stadium in Montreal. Scoring Ottawa Rough Riders - 23 Touchdowns - Tony Gabriel and Bill Hatanaka Field goals - Gerry Organ (3) Converts - Gerry Organ (2) Saskatchewan Roughriders - 20 Touchdowns - Steve Mazurak and Bob Richardson Field goals - Bob Macoritti (2) Converts - Bob Macoritti (2) Game summary After an early field goal, Ottawa increased their lead in record-setting fashion, with Bill Hatanaka (a York University graduate who would later attend Harvard University) returning a punt for a 79-yard touchdown (then a CFL record). Ottawa led 10-0 at the end of the first quarter. Saskatchewan owned the second quarter. CFL legend Ron Lancaster hit Steve Mazurak and Bob Richardson with touchdown passes and Bob Macoritti added a field goal. On defence, all-star Ted Provost intercepted a Tom Clements pass to set up a touchdown and middle linebacker Cleveland Vann covered the field with his excellent play. Unfortunately, the Green Riders were without their longtime star running back, George Reed, who had retired after the previous season, and his talented replacement, Molly McGee, left the game with an injury. The halftime score was 17-10 in favour of Saskatchewan. The teams traded field goals in the third quarter, but the quarter also included its share of dramatic moments such as Gerry Organ's 52-yard run on a fake punt and the subsequent interception by Saskatchewan's Cleveland Vann. Ottawa kicked another field goal in the fourth quarter, making the score 20-16. A later drive stalled on a goal-line stand by Saskatchewan. With time running out, the Rough Riders found themselves on the Saskatchewan 24-yard- line with 20 seconds left. Ottawa quarterback (and Notre Dame University grad) Tom Clements waved off the play from the bench. Canadian Football Hall of Fame tight end Tony Gabriel headed towards the end zone, faked a post pattern and turned to the corner. Saskatchewan DB Ted Provost fell for the fake and Gabriel hauled in Clements' pass, with Provost and Ray Odums in vain pursuit. The play was spectacular in its execution, its game-winning importance and in the dramatic manner in which it unfolded, and is often simply referred to as \\"The Catch.\\" Trivia * All the points in this game were scored by Canadians. * This was the last Grey Cup championship for the Ottawa Rough Riders (the team folded in 1996) and the last playoff game for the Saskatchewan Roughriders until 1988. The 1976 victory was the last major sports championship of any kind for Ottawa until the Ottawa Redblacks (the third CFL franchise to play in the city) won the 104th Grey Cup in 2016.

In phytogeography, it is in the phytochorion St. Helena and Ascension Region of the African Subkingdom, in the Paleotropical Kingdom. Endemic and introduced flora The endemic plants of Saint Helena include many notable Cabbage Tree or, \\"insular arborescent Asteraceae\\", members of the daisy family which have evolved a shrubby or tree-like habit on islands. Other notable endemics include the closely related St Helena redwood (Trochetiopsis erythroxylon) and St Helena dwarf ebony (Trochetiopsis ebenus). These are unrelated to the redwood trees of California or to the ebony trees of commerce, being instead in the Mallow family (Malvaceae). Vegetation Today there are three major vegetation zones: the tree-fern thicket of the highest parts of the central ridge; the pastures of middle elevations and the dry, eroded \\"crown wastes\\" of lower elevations. Of these only the tree-fern thicket is a natural vegetation type. The middle elevations were formerly covered with native woodland of gumwoods (Commidendrum) and other trees, now largely destroyed. The \\"Crown wastes\\" or coastal zones were formerly covered with native scrub, of which a major component was probably St Helena dwarf ebony (Trochetiopsis ebenus and St Helena tree ebony Trochetiopsis melanoxylon). Human impact and conservation The destruction of the native vegetation began soon after the discovery of the island by the Portuguese in 1502, with the introduction of goats. As there were no native herbivorous mammals, the flora was unadapted to such threats. Later with the establishment of permanent settlement on the island by the English East India Company in 1659, many introduced plants became established which created new vegetation types. Furthermore the native trees were subject to catastrophic cutting for such purposes as housebuilding and to fuel stills for the distillation of arrack. As a result of this legacy many endemic plant species are extinct or critically endangered. Endemic vascular plants of St Helena Monocotyledons *Bulbostylis lichtensteiniana (Kunth) C.B.

He worked in Germany and was noted as one of the leading portrait painters of the 1560s. Life The earliest likely reference to Neufchatel occurs in the archives of the Antwerp's Guild of St. Luke, which list a 'Colyn van Nieucasteel' as a student of Pieter Coecke van Aelst in the year 1539. As a student in Antwerp, Neufchatel would have been introduced to the works of Frans Floris, Willem Key, and other masters of the 1540s. From 1561 to 1567 he lived in Nuremberg. It appears that he relocated to Germany for religious reasons, for on 23 July 1567, the city council ordered him not engage in any more Calvinist agitation. It is believed that he stayed in Nuremberg until at least 1573, the year he painted a portrait of Johan Gregor van der Schardt. After that year nothing is known of his life.

In 1981, he won his final Group one on April Run in Prix Vermeille before finishing a close third in the Arc. He was the stable jockey of famous French trainer Fran√ßois Boutin for nine years. He joined Boutin straight from school as a 14yr-old apprentice in 1966, via the local employment exchange.The Irish Derby by Guy Williams & Francis Hyland He was on board Nonoalco when the colt made a winning debut in the Prix Yacowlef at Deauville in 1973, breaking the course record in the process Timeform Annuals of each season and having been made stable jockey to Boutin that season, although Piggott and Saint- Martin were still used when available.

In 1977, when his 17 Group winners included Trepan, Super Concorde and Malacate, Paquet won the Cravache d‚ÄôOr (Golden Whip) as French Champion Jockey, which he won again in 1979, the year in which he also won the Champion Stakes on Northern Baby, on whom he had finished third in The Derby at Epsom.Courses Et Elevage At the end of 1981 he went to Hong Kong and became the stable jockey of 1966 Epsom Derby winning trainer Gordon Symth and English trainer Derek Kent, and then Australian trainer George Moore, his father-in-law at the time.

His career came to an abrupt end while training on Silver Star during a morning training session just weeks later on 13 February 1984. He was thrown onto the turf by his mount and sustained a serious skull fracture. He remained in a coma for more than three months, before finally regaining consciousness. Initially left partially paralysed, he spent time at a rehabilitation centre in Queensland before returning to France.

She was portrayed by Barbara Crampton, who departed from the role in 1993. Crampton returned from 1998 to 2002 and again from 2006 to 2007. Much of Leanna's history revolves around her marriage to Victor Newman. Character Creation Casting Barbara Crampton was the only actress to play Leanna. She previously had roles in soaps such as Days of Our Lives and Guiding Light. During an interview with Daily Grind House Crampton stated: \\"When it first started, that role was only supposed to be for three months. Then they cast me in it, and after two months they said, 'You know, it‚Äôs kind of working. We‚Äôd like to keep your character for another year.' So I said OK and I worked on it for a year. Then they said, 'You know, it‚Äôs really working. We want to hire you on for another three years.' I did it for another three years, and then I did it for another two or three years after that. She had a good long run for somebody who wasn‚Äôt married and in a family on a soap opera.\\" Crampton said there is always a possibility for Leanna to make another guest appearance.  Characterization  Born as Leanna Randolphe, she is known as \\"the unscrupulous reporter who penned 'Ruthless,' a scandalous expos√© about Victor Newman\\". Due to Leanna's psychotic personality, Crampton did some research in order to properly portray the character: \\"I had to do some investigating about what types of personality disorders she could have to make this character interesting, and I talked to a lot of psychiatrists about it. I came up with a personality profile for her that I played,\\" she stated during an interview. Storylines 1987‚Äì93 Ashley Abbott had a nervous breakdown after having an abortion, ran off to New York City, and lost her memory after she was mugged. She ended up at a mental hospital where Dr. Steven Lassiter was her psychiatrist. Her father, John, eventually found her in New York and returned her to a posh private institution near Genoa City. Stephen had fallen in love with Ashley, followed, and became a resident psychiatrist there. Ashley recovered thanks to Steven's devotion, and they were married. During their honeymoon in Hawaii, they were stalked by Leanna Randolphe, a former mental patient of Stephen's who fantasized that they were lovers. After Leanna made several attempts to murder Ashley with a poisoned Lei, Ashley spent most of her honeymoon sick. Ashley never found out about Leanna's connection to Stephen nor that she tried to murder her. Leanna followed them back to Genoa City and abandoned her obsession with Stephen once she got involved with Jack Abbott, who arranged for her to write a sensational tell-all biography, under the pseudonym of Nora Randall called \\"Ruthless: The Victor Newman Story,\\" which would expose and destroy Victor. Ironically, Victor also hired her to write an authorized biography of his life. Without Jack's consent, or knowledge, Leanna added an extra chapter to \\"Ruthless\\" that chronicled Ashley's ill-fated affair with Victor, including details about her abortion and nervous breakdown. Victor was outraged, assumed his estranged wife Nikki Newman had been behind the expos√©, and divorced her. In his anger, and still unaware that Leanna had written \\"Ruthless\\", Victor took Leanna with him in his private jet and they marry in Las Vegas in October 1988.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cjFPAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=-QIEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6960%2C3461512 In February 1989, Nikki shocks the newly weds by revealing their marriage is invalid because Victor and Nikki's divorce isn't finalized. Despite the failed marriage, Victor and Leanna stay together.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ez8gAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=XXoEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6978%2C7682983 On her own, Leanna used her wiles to land a job as an advice columnist for the lovelorn at a publication owned by Victor using the pen name \\"Leanna Love\\". Because Leanna felt guilty about \\"Ruthless\\", and had come to genuinely care for Victor, she wrote another book called \\"Victor Newman - Man and Myth\\", using her real name, Leanna Randolphe. When Victor learned that Leanna and Jack Abbott had been lovers, he realized Leanna had written \\"Ruthless\\". Victor publicly fired her from his company and sold the publication, then divorced Leanna, and remarried Nikki. Victor devised a plan to punish Jack by orchestrating a takeover of Jabot, displaced Jack, and made Brad Carlton his superior. With the help of long-time admirer and friend of Victor, Douglas Austin, Leanna created the \\"I Hate Men Campaign\\" rallying wronged women everywhere. By a year later, Leanna had forgotten about being a man-hater and competed with Jill Foster Abbott for Rex Sterling, then again for John Abbott a year after that. Leanna's notoriety landed her a nationally syndicated gossip talk show on television called the Leanna Love Show, and she has since made infrequent stops to Genoa City whenever juicy gossip concerning Victor is to be had. 1998‚Äì2002 In 1998, Victor was involved in a bitter divorce from Diane Jenkins. Diane's scheming attorney, Michael Baldwin, arranged for her to appear on Leanna's talk show, The Leanna Love Show, to gain public sympathy for her at the settlement hearing. Leanna, still bitter over the ill treatment she had received from Victor, was happy to oblige. When Victor tuned in to the show he was outraged that Diane had exposed his personal life on national television. Victor suffered major business setbacks after Diane's appearance on the show. As damage control and to expedite the divorce, Victor gave in to all of Diane's settlement demands. Later, as revenge, Victor purchased Westmark Media, the company that owned Leanna's show, and fired Leanna and cancelled her show. 2006‚Äì07 In 2006, Leanna, now a journalist, returned to Genoa City to interview Ashley, who was being charged with the murder of Tom Fisher (Roscoe Born). (In reality, Ashley was covering for her amnesiac father, John Abbott.) Leanna told Ashley that she would paint a flattering picture of her in her story, but instead, she set up Ashley to make her look guilty. After the interview, Leanna left town again. In 2007, she returned once more to conduct an interview with David Chow (Vincent Irizarry) about the death of Carmen Mesta (Marisa Ramirez).

The Treaty of Traverse des Sioux () was signed on July 23, 1851, at Traverse des Sioux in Minnesota Territory between the United States government and Sioux Indian bands in Minnesota Territory. By this treaty, the Sioux ceded large tracts of territory and agreed to move on to reservations along the Minnesota River in exchange for annuities of cash and goods. The treaty was instigated by Alexander Ramsey, the first governor of Minnesota Territory, and Luke Lea, Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington, D.C. The United States wanted the treaty to gain control of agricultural lands for more European- American settlers. Background The Wahpeton and Sisseton bands of the Upper Dakota (sometimes spelled Dahkotah on treaties) were hesitant to sign away so much land, but older members of the tribes believed that the results of the 1825 First Treaty of Prairie du Chien and the Sioux defeat in the Black Hawk War limited their choices. The Wahpeton and Sisseton bands ceded their lands in southern and western Minnesota Territory, along with some lands in Iowa and Dakota Territory. In exchange, the United States promised payment of $1,665,000 in cash and annuities. Through the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux and the Treaty of Mendota, the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute bands of the Lower Sioux ceded territory of nearly of land. The US paid the Dakota an annuity the equivalent of 7.5 cents an acre and charged settlers $1.25 an acre. The US set aside two reservations for the Sioux along the Minnesota River, each about wide and long. Later the government declared these were intended to be temporary, in an effort to force the Sioux out of Minnesota. The Upper Sioux Agency was established near Granite Falls, Minnesota, while the Lower Sioux Agency was established about thirty miles downstream near what developed as Redwood Falls, Minnesota. The Upper Sioux were not satisfied with their reservation because of low food supplies, but as it included several of their old villages, they agreed to stay. The Lower Sioux were displaced from their traditional woodlands, and were dissatisfied with their new territory of mostly prairie. The Sioux also resented the separate \\"trader's paper\\" that was included in the treaty, as it paid $400,000 of the promised treaty annuity total to fur traders and mixed-bloods who had financial claims against the tribes. Traders' papers were documents that contained the names of traders, included in the aforesaid claims, who were due fees from previous trades. It said that they were allowed to take in land currency what may have been owed them out of the Dakotas' treaty payments. The Dakota agreed to sign the treaty but also requested a copy. Upon signing the copy, they were asked to sign a third paper which they believed to be a third copy. The Dakota were tricked into signing these \\"trader's papers\\", as the interpreters had not accurately told them what the document meant. Despite these issues, the crush of settlers moving into the area meant more European-American people encroaching on Sioux land. As the US had promised increased annuity payments in exchange for more land cessions, Sioux leaders went to Washington, D.C. in 1858 to sign another pair of treaties; these ceded the reservation north of the Minnesota River. The US intended the treaties to encourage the Sioux to convert from their nomadic hunting lifestyle into more European-American settled farming, offering them compensation in the transition. The forced change in lifestyle and the much lower than expected payments from the federal government caused economic suffering and increased social tensions within the tribes. Tensions erupted in the Dakota War of 1862. Terms The preamble begins with, The abbreviated terms of the treaty were: 1\\\\. Peace and friendship shall be perpetual 2\\\\. Land to cede 3\\\\. Stricken out by U.S. Senate. 4\\\\. Payments and other payments held in trust. 5\\\\. Laws against liquors in Indian country. 6\\\\. Rules and regulations to protect the rights of persons and property among the Indians. Signers included Sleepy Eye, of the Sisseton Sioux.

Originally named Simon Covington, he was born in Bedford, Bedfordshire, England, the youngest child of Simon Covington V and Elizabeth Brown. After Covington's trip on the Beagle, he then emigrated to Australia and settled as a postmaster, marrying Eliza Twyford there. Beagle voyage When he was fifteen years old, Syms Covington became \\"fiddler & boy to Poop- cabin\\" on the second survey expedition of HMS Beagle,In July 1832 Darwin copied out a Watch-bill listing the crew and their positions, which left England on 27 December 1831 under the command of captain Robert FitzRoy. Covington kept a journal of the voyage, and in September 1832 at Bah√≠a Blanca in South America he noted wildlife found there, including a find of rhea eggs, and giant fossil bones of the megatherium which were collected and sent to England. It is not clear if he was assisting Charles Darwin with this work, but FitzRoy's later account suggests that both Darwin and Covington worked at excavating the fossils, and on 3 November Darwin arranged some clothing for Covington. On 29 April 1833, Darwin and Covington landed and took up residence ashore at Maldonado, Uruguay, while the Beagle went elsewhere on survey work., After an excursion into the interior lasting twelve days, they spent several weeks at Maldonado preparing the collections to be sent back to England. In a letter home started on 22 May, Darwin told his father that he had decided to take Covington on as a servant ‚Äì He had been thinking about this for some time, but had not yet consulted the captain. In an addition to the letter, dated 6 July, Darwin announced that he had FitzRoy's agreement, and an unexpected saving ‚Äì As well as working as a servant and general amanuensis, writing out Darwin's records of investigations, Covington became Darwin's assistant as a collector, hunter and taxidermist. In addition to his duties, Covington kept a personal journal regarding his impressions of the voyage. His journal includes accounts ranging from his daily mundane tasks to impressions of the lands and the people he encountered, and it provides an alternative perspective to supplement Darwin's Journal and Remarks, better known as The Voyage of the Beagle. Return, work for Darwin and emigration After the Beagle returned in 1836, Covington became Darwin's manservant and continued in his duties as a general amanuensis. His own collection of bird specimens was invaluable in establishing the relationship of Darwin's Finches to each of the Galapagos Islands as, unlike Darwin, he had taken care to label where each specimen had been taken. Covington remained in Darwin's service until 25 February 1839. He decided to emigrate, and was given a personal reference from Darwin in a letter dated 29 May 1839. Life in Australia Records indicate that Covington landed in Sydney in 1840, and he married Eliza Twyford who lived at Stroud, a small town in northern New South Wales. Eliza Twyford was from London, and had traveled to Australia with her family in 1832 on the ship Princess Royal as a free settler. Covington was able to draw on his naval connections to find employment, and by 1843 was working as a clerk at the Sydney coal depot of the Australian Agricultural Company. Around 1844 the family, with their first two sons, accepted the invitation of Captain Lloyd and moved to the South coast property at Pambula, which Lloyd had been given in lieu of a pension from the Royal Navy. Covington continued to correspond with Darwin, who sent him a gift of a replacement ear-trumpet to help with Covington's increasing deafness. In response to Darwin's request for specimens, Covington and his eldest son collected a large number of barnacles at nearby Twofold Bay. Darwin's letter of 23 November 1850 expressed his delight at having just received the box, which included particularly unusual species. This contributed to the extensive studies of barnacles which established Darwin as a biologist. Covington became Postmaster of Pambula in 1854, and managed an inn called the Forest Oak Inn built on the coast road above the floodplain where the first Pambula township had been repeatedly damaged by floods. His original inn was licensed in 1855, and the building which still stands was constructed on the same site about a year later. By 1848 he and his wife had eight children, six sons and two daughters. In 1861 Covington died of 'paralysis' at only 47 years old. The inn was then run by his widow, and later by her second husband Llewelyn Heaven. The license was taken over by John Behl around 1864, and the building became known as The Retreat in 1895. It has been used as a doctor's surgery and more recently as a Thai restaurant, and its red tin roof and double chimneys can still be seen beside a sharp bend of the main Coast Road. Books discussing Covington \\"The Journal of Syms Covington, Assistant to Charles Darwin Esq.\\" was discussed by Jonathan Hodge and Gregory Radick in The Cambridge Companion to Darwin. In 1998, Australian author Roger McDonald published a novel based on Syms Covington's life and his work for Darwin, called Mr Darwin's Shooter. References *. .

History The band was formed in November 1994 in Camden, London, England, by lead singer and Ex-Gallon Drunk drummer Max D√©charn√©, guitarists Johnny Johnson (replaced in 1996 by Huck Whitney) and Mark Hosking, bassist Paul Dempsey, and Joe Whitney on the drums. They took their name from an Elvis Presley film title. The band was signed to the London-based, but Japanese owned, Vinyl Japan UK Ltd. The band first gained attention in Europe when they released their EP \\"Hospital, Heaven or Hell\\" which received praise from well-known English radio personalities John Peel and Steve Lamacq. Because of this, they recorded six John Peel Sessions which were released throughout the 1990s and eventually released together in 2000 on a double album, The Six John Peel Sessions. In 1996, the Flaming Stars released their first album, Songs From the Bar Room Floor, which was followed by Sell Your Soul to the Flaming Stars in 1997. In 2001, The Flaming Stars released A Walk on the Wired Side, a slight departure from their previous works. The album took less from 1960s style garage rock and instead focused more on creating their own unique sound. The Stars gained a minor hit in the UK from their album A Walk on the Wired Side with the song, \\"Some Things You Don't Forget\\". The band received considerable attention in the UK's underground scene while remaining fairly unknown in the United States. The Flaming Stars released their fifth studio album, Sunset & Void, in 2002. Two years later in 2004, the Flaming Stars released Named and Shamed, their 10th anniversary album. In early 2006, Vinyl Japan went into receivership and the Stars were signed to Big Beat Records, which is owned by Ace Records. On 16 March that year, they released their first effort on Big Beat, a 42 track compilation album London After Midnight: Singles, Rarities and Bar Room Floor-Fillers 1995-2005. In September 2006, they released their seventh studio album, Born Under A Bad Neon Sign. The Flaming Stars played a comeback gig supporting The Nightingales at Dublin Castle, Camden on 26 October 2016.

He is also a poet. Early life and education Kravinsky was born to a Jewish family and earned two Ph.D. degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, one in 1989 in Rhetoric with a dissertation on Aristotle‚Äôs topoi, and the other in 1994 in English Literature with a dissertation on paradoxical polysemy in Milton's Paradise Lost. He also completed required courses for a third doctoral degree, in cultural anthropology from The New School For Social Research, but did not take the preliminary examination or write a dissertation. His B.A. from Dartmouth College was in Asian Studies, with a specialty in Indian Studies. Career He lectured full-time at Penn for some years, was a Faculty in Residence for four years, and one year was selected, in the University's published book of student evaluations, as the most overall highly ranked faculty member at Penn. Kravinsky then worked for insurance companies designing and teaching training workshops in management development; taught handicapped (\\"learning disabled\\" and ‚Äúsocially and emotionally disturbed,‚Äù i.e., conduct-disordered) children in inner-city Philadelphia schools; and taught Transcendental Meditation. Philanthropy After amassing a real estate fortune, having started with one thousand dollars, Kravinsky gave away virtually all of it to various charities, concentrating on public health organizations. Specifically, he donated almost all of the $45 million he amassed in real estate to charities dealing with improving health; he made the largest individual contribution ever to the foundation supporting the United States government Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and also made major donations to The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and to the Ohio State University College of Public Health. Kidney donation After Kravinsky learned that many African-Americans have difficulty obtaining kidneys from family members, he sought out a hospital in Philadelphia that would allow him to donate one of his kidneys to a lower-income black person. According to Peter Singer, writing in The New York Times, Kravinsky justified the donation mathematically when speaking to Singer's students, noting that the chances of dying as a result of the procedure would have been about 1 in 4,000. Kravinsky believed that, under the circumstances, \\"to withhold a kidney from someone who would otherwise die means valuing one‚Äôs own life at 4,000 times that of a stranger\\", a ratio he termed \\"obscene.\\" Following the kidney donation, Kravinsky did several interviews with the media, including a radio conference with Robert Siegel of NPR and a TV appearance on CBS among others. During some of these public interviews, Kravinsky argued that should someone be, for instance, on the verge of curing cancer but would die unless Kravinsky were to donate his second kidney, that being the only match in the world, that it would be morally correct to donate the kidney in order that millions of people would be saved.

Built by Brooke Marine (which became Brooke Yachts during the vessel's construction), Young Endeavour was given to Australia by the British government in 1988, as a gift to celebrate Australian Bicentenary. Although operated and maintained by the Royal Australian Navy, Young Endeavour delivers up to twenty youth development sail training voyages to young Australians aged 16 ‚Äì 23 each year. Navy personnel staff the ship and the Young Endeavour Youth Scheme coordinate the voyage program. During each voyage the ship embarks up to 24 young Australians who learn the skills required to sail a square-rigged tall ship; including how to navigate, keep watch, cook in the galley, take the helm and climb the 30 metre mast to work aloft, setting and furling sails. They are encouraged to pursue personal and team goals and challenges in an unfamiliar environment as they learn to sail a square-rigged tall ship. Near the end of the voyage, youth crew elect a command team who take full responsibility for Young Endeavour for 24 hours, sailing the ship along the Australian coast. On their last day at sea, the youth crew host a local group of youth with special needs, sharing their new found knowledge and experience. Design and construction Young Endeavour has a displacement of 239 tonnes.Sch√§uffelen, Chapman Great Sailing Ships Of The World, p. 20 The ship is in length overall and in waterline length, has a beam of , and a draught of . The vessel is brigantine rigged, with a tall mainmast, and ten sails with a total area of . Auxiliary propulsion is provided by two Perkins V8 M200 TI diesel engines, providing each. Young Endeavour can achieve speeds of under sail, or running on the diesels. The vessel is a sister ship to Tunas Samudera, a Malaysian Navy sail training ship. The ship was ordered by the British government as a gift to Australia in recognition of Australian Bicentenary. Designed by naval architect Colin Mudie, Young Endeavour was laid down by Brooke Marine (which became Brooke Yachts during the vessel's construction) in May 1986, and was launched on 2 June 1987.Young Endeavour Youth Scheme, About The Ship On 3 August, Young Endeavour sailed from Lowestoft in England to Australia, via Rio de Janeiro, Tristan da Cunha, and the waters of Antarctica. On 25 January 1988, Young Endeavour was handed over to the Australian Government. The ship's motto is carpe diem, Latin for \\"Seize the day\\".Perryman, Before the Mast' in Young Endeavour, p. 2 Young Endeavour Youth Scheme Although the Australian government decided that Young Endeavour would be operated and maintained by the Royal Australian Navy, the vessel would be used to provide sail training to Australian youth. The \\"Young Endeavour Youth Scheme\\" was established in 1988 as a not-for-profit organisation, with a civilian management and administration team based in Sydney, the ship's homeport. The scheme's aims are to develop teamwork and leadership skills in Australian youth, while increasing participants' self-awareness and sense of community spirit. The youth crew of Young Endeavour manning the yards at the end of a day sail Under the scheme, 24 to 30 \\"youth crew\\" (aged between 16 and 23) join a voyage to supplement the 9 or 10 naval personnel from the Mine Warfare, Hydrographic and Patrol Boat Force, which Young Endeavour is attached to.Davis, Young Endeavour's world of opportunity, p. 10Perryman, Before the Mast' in Young Endeavour, p. 1 Over 500 youth crew per year participate in the scheme, and are selected for the voyages by a biannual ballot. Each voyage typically lasts ten to eleven days, during which the youth crew rotate through most roles aboard the ship, stand watches, and help with Young Endeavours operation. Near the end of the voyage, the crew undergoes \\"command day\\": a 24-hour period in which the ship is entirely under control of the youth crew. As part of most voyages, the combined crew takes a group of special needs youth on a half-day sail. Between the scheme's inception in 1988 and mid-2018, over 13,500 youth have participated in voyages, while another 11,500 special needs youth have been involved in half-day sails. The vessel is at sea for approximately 240 days per year. Operational history Young Endeavour left Australian waters for the first time in 1990, when she sailed to New Zealand for celebrations of the sesquicentennial of the Treaty of Waitangi's signing and the opening of the 1990 Commonwealth Games. During 1992, the ship circumnavigated the world and participated in 500th anniversary celebrations of Christopher Columbus' round-the-world voyage. In 1995, Young Endeavour circumnavigated Australia, and visited Indonesia for the nation's 50th anniversary of independence. During 2001, as part of Centenary of Federation celebrations, the tall ship circumnavigated Australia. Young Endeavour off Melbourne in 2013 In 2006, Young Endeavour visited New Zealand. Young Endeavour participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney. At the end of 2014, the ship departed Sydney for a round-the-world trip. Information also taken from the individual voyage sub-pages. The trip consists of eight separate voyages, each with a separate youth crew embarked: to Rio de Janeiro (the ship's 500th voyage), Cadiz, √áanakkale (with the third and fourth voyage crews aboard for the 100th Anzac Day dawn service off Gallipoli), Southampton (ending with a function hosting Young Endeavour designer and delivery crew, followed by four weeks' maintenance in the ship's port of construction), Amsterdam (including competition in the 2015 Tall Ships' Race, and involvement in the Sail Bremerhaven and Sail Amsterdam festivals), back to Rio, and Cape Town, before concluding in Fremantle. The trip is due to conclude in late December 2015.

Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990), is a U.S. Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the First Amendment allows states to outlaw the mere possession, as distinct from the distribution, of child pornography.. In so doing, the Court extended the holding of New York v. Ferber,. which had upheld laws banning the distribution of child pornography against a similar First Amendment challenge, and distinguished Stanley v. Georgia,. which had struck down a Georgia law forbidding the possession of pornography by adults in their own homes. The Court also determined that the Ohio law at issue was not overbroad, relying on a narrowing interpretation of the law the Ohio Supreme Court had adopted in prior proceedings in the case. However, because it was unclear whether the State had proved all the elements of the crime, the Court ordered a new trial. Decision The Court held that, with respect to child pornography, the government does not act out of a \\"paternalistic interest\\" in regulating a citizen's mind. By outlawing the possession of child pornography, the government seeks to eradicate legitimate harms by diminishing the market for child pornography. These harms include the psychological damage to children‚Äîboth the children depicted in the pornography, for whom the images produced serve as a permanent record of the abuse, and the children whom potential abusers might lure with such images. \\"Given the importance of the State's interest in protecting the victims of child pornography, we cannot fault Ohio for attempting to stamp out this vice at all levels in the distribution chain.\\" Even if the First Amendment did not categorically forbid the government to ban the possession of child pornography, Osborne argued that the Ohio statute under which he was convicted was overbroad. A ban on speech is \\"overbroad\\" if it outlaws both prohibited speech as well as a substantial amount of legitimate speech. The statute, as written, banned depictions of nudity, and the Court had previously held that nudity was protected expression. But the Ohio Supreme Court had held that the statute only applied to nudity that \\"constitutes a lewd exhibition or involves a graphic focus on the genitals, and where the person depicted is neither the child nor the ward of the person charged\\" with violating it. Furthermore, the Ohio Supreme Court had required that the defendant had to know that the images depicted children before being convicted of possession of child pornography. By narrowing the scope of the statute in these ways, the Ohio Supreme Court had sufficiently tailored the law only to those images most harmful to children. However, the Court reversed Osborne's conviction because, after reviewing the record of the trial, it observed that the State did not present evidence that the images were \\"lewd\\" within the meaning of the statute. Because lewdness was an essential element of the crime, the State had not satisfied its obligation to prove all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The dissenting opinion, written by Justice Brennan and joined by Justices Marshall and Stevens, argued, \\"When speech is eloquent and the ideas expressed lofty, it is easy to find restrictions on them invalid. But were the First Amendment limited to such discourse, our freedom would be sterile indeed. Mr. Osborne's pictures may be distasteful, but the Constitution guarantees both his right to possess them privately and his right to avoid punishment under an overbroad law.\\"Osborne, 495 U.S. at 148 (Brennan, J., dissenting).

The phylum contains two classes Gemmatimonadetes and Longimicrobia. Species The type species Gemmatimonas aurantiaca strain T-27T was isolated from activated sludge in a sewage treatment system in 2003. It is a Gram-negative bacterium able to grow by both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. The second cultured species was Gemmatirosa kalamazoonensis gen. nov., sp. nov. strain KBS708, which was isolated from organically managed agricultural soil in Michigan USA. The third cultured species Gemmatimonas phototrophica strain AP64T was isolated from a shallow freshwater desert lake TiƒÅn √© h√∫ (Swan Lake) in North China. A unique feature of this organism is the presence of bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers. It probably acquired genes for anoxygenic photosynthesis via horizontal gene transfer. G. phototrophica is a facultative photoheterotrophic organism. It requires the supply of organic substrate for growth, but it may obtain additional energy for its metabolism from light. Longimicrobium terrae strain CB-286315T was isolated from a soil sample from a typical Mediterranean forest ecosystem located in Granada, Spain. Due to this large phylogenetic distance from other cultured Gemmatimonades, it established a novel class named Longimicrobia. Environmental distribution Data from culture-independent studies indicate that Gemmatimonadetes are widely distributed in many natural habitats. They make up about 2% of soil bacterial communities and has been identified as one of the top nine phyla found in soils; yet, there are currently only six cultured isolates. Gemmatimonadetes have been found in a variety of arid soils, such as grassland, prairie, and pasture soil, as well as eutrophic lake sediments and alpine soils. This wide range of environments where Gemmatimonadetes have been found suggests an adaptation to low soil moisture. A study conducted showed that the distribution of the Gemmatimonadetes in soil tends to be more dependent on the moisture availability than aggregation, reinforcing the belief that the members of this phylum prefer dryer soils.. Smaller numbers were also found in various aquatic environments, such as fresh waters and sediments. Taxonomy The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LSPN), National Center for Biotechnology Information and the All-Species Living Tree Project. * Phylum Gemmatimonadetes Zhang et al. 2003 [Gemmatimonadota Whitman et al. 2018] ** Class Longimicrobia Pascual et al. 2016 *** Order Longimicrobiales Pascual et al. 2016 **** Family Longimicrobiaceae Pascual et al. 2016 ***** Genus Longimicrobium Pascual et al. 2016 ****** Species Longimicrobium terrae Pascual et al. 2016 ** Class Gemmatimonadetes Zhang et al. 2003 *** Order Gemmatimonadales Zhang et al. 2003 **** Family Gemmatimonadaceae Zhang et al. 2003 ***** Genus Gemmatirosa DeBruyn et al. 2013 ****** Species Gemmatirosa kalamazoonesis DeBruyn et al. 2013 ***** Genus Gemmatimonas Zhang et al. 2003 emend.

Between 1629 and 1636, Fedorovych played a key role in the regional conflicts involving the rebellion of the Ruthenian (Ukrainian) Cossacks and peasants against the Polish rule over the Dnieper Ukraine territory as well as in the conflicts that included the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Tsardom of Russia and the Ukrainians torn between those two neighbors. With many circumstances of his life remaining mysterious to this day, Fedorovych is a revered figure in both Ukrainian folklore and in the Ukrainian national idea, a hero of poems by Taras Shevchenko, a personage of the earliest Ukrainian motion picture and one of only four Cossack leaders explicitly mentioned in the Pavlo Chubynsky poem that later became the basis of the modern National Anthem of Ukraine. Early life Taras Fedorovych was born to a Tatar family in Crimea, his given name was Hassan. It is unclear when he converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity and joined the Zaporozhian Cossacks Host. He is initially documented by references in the 1620s to his position as the Cossack Polkovnyk (Colonel) Hassan Tarasa in Hungarian chronicles, noted for considerable cruelty during his participation in the Thirty Year War as a Habsburg mercenary.

Fedorovych uprising Hostilities The area up in arms during the Fedorovych Uprising. In March 1630, Fedorovych became the leader of a Cossack and peasant revolt, which became known as the Fedorovych Uprising carried out by the unregistered Cossacks dissatisfied with the conditions of the 1625 Treaty of Kurukove (also known as the Treaty of Lake Kurukove) signed earlier by Doroshenko, which restricted the number of the registry to only six thousand. In the meantime, the real numbers of Cossacks swelled by the constant flow of runaway peasants and, especially, at the end of the Polish-Swedish War (1625‚Äì1629), by the addition of a huge number of demobilized Ukrainians who refused to accept a return under Polish serfdom.Holubets, Mykola –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∞ –Ü—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—è –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ [Velyka Istoriya Ukrayiny] (The Grand History of Ukraine), Section: \\"Vid Konashevycha do Ostryanina\\"(\\"From Konashevych to Ostryanin\\"), originally published Lw√≥w (1935). Reprinted Kiev: Hlobus (1993). . The ranks of Cossacks who joined the resistance reached forty thousand. The Cossack uprising fell on the fertile ground of the overall condition of Ukrainian peasantry who under Polish control were subject to continued enserfment and exploitation by mostly Polish or polonized szlachta (nobility).Ihor Pidkova (editor), Roman Shust (editor), \\"Dovidnyk z istorii Ukrainy\\", 3 Volumes, \\"(t. 3), Kiev, 1993-1999, (t. 1), (t. 2), (t. 3). Article: Fedorovych Uprising Particularly resented was the attempt to impose Roman Catholicism on the unwilling Ukrainians, who had been traditionally Eastern Orthodox.\\"Poland, history of\\". In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. About ten thousand rebels proceeded from the Zaporizhian Sich towards the upper Dnieper territories, overrunning the Polish forces stationed there. The rebels captured and executed the Hetman of the registered Cossacks Hryhoriy Chorny for his pro- Polish stance and support of the Union of Brest, and subsequently came to an agreement on a new leadership by nominating Fedorovych for the position of Hetman. Fedorovych addressed the Ukrainian commoners with several Universals calling upon everyone to join his uprising against the Polish \\"usurpers\\". The turbulence spread over the nearby territories, with many Cossacks and peasants rising against the local Polish nobles as well as wealthy Jewish merchants who, despite their limited involvement in the local power structure were also hated by the peasants as Polish land owners frequently gave to the Jews the role of arendators (see tax farming) in the local taxation system. As religious services such as baptism, wedding ceremonies and funerals conducted in the Eastern Orthodox tradition customary for Ruthenians, were now to be taxed, with most of the commoners and especially the Cossacks being fiercely Orthodox, the Jews were perceived by many Ruthenians as a part of the oppressor/exploiter group. As clashes increased, casualties rose on both sides. After a victory at Korsun over the Polish army sent against them, the rebel Cossacks controlled a large territory that included Korsun, Pereiaslav, Kaniv as well as other cities, with Pereiaslav becoming their main base. In response to their successes, a large Polish army led by Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski was sent to confront the Cossacks. The army, strengthened by German mercenary forces, was harassed by the rebels, and, in turn, plundered and massacred Lysianka, Dymer and several other Ukrainian settlements, then crossed the Dnieper where they were met by the rebels, both front and rear, as more Ukrainians rose in what became an area-wide rebellion against the Poles. The indecisive skirmishes around Pereiaslav lasted three weeks until the . Koniecpolski laid siege to the Cossack stronghold, but lacking the support of artillery and infantry, he could not break its walls; the Cossacks, however, were lacking supplies and agreed to negotiations. Though the Polish army was not defeated, its inability to defeat the rebellious Cossacks meant that the latter gained an upper hand in the negotiations; Ukrainian historiography calls the battle at Pereiaslav a victory, but this is disputed by Polish historiography. Negotiations Fedorovych's military successes forced Koniecpolski to start negotiations with the Cossack leadership, which resulted in the 1630 Treaty of Pereiaslav. Many of the demands of the non-registered Cossacks and Fedorovych, their leader, were discarded in the treaty negotiations by other Cossack leaders. The main demand voiced by Fedorovych and his supporters--that the Cossack privileges routinely guaranteed to the limited number of registered Cossacks should be granted to all runaway peasants who claimed Cossackdom--was rejected and, according to a narrow compromise, the Cossack register was enlarged from six to eight thousand. In return, Koniecpolski demanded that Fedorovych be delivered into Polish custody. Fedorovych, uncertain of the decision that would be reached, over his head, by the \\"compromising\\" faction of Cossack leadership, left Pereiaslav along with other Cossacks dissatisfied with the agreement and headed for the Cossack stronghold of the Zaporizhian Sich. Meanwhile, the Cossack leadership faction inclined to a compromise with Poland, elected Timofiy Orendarenko whose Hetmanship was confirmed with Koniecpolski's agreement. Fedorovych, disgruntled with this turn of events, tried to raise the Cossack masses to start a new uprising, but the energy for such an undertaking was no longer forthcoming. Russia's ally Fedorovych fought on the Russian side in the Smolensk War against Poland (1632‚Äì34). In the winter of 1634-35 he yet again tried to convince the Cossacks to turn against the Poles at the Kaniv Council, but received only very limited support. In 1635 he negotiated with the Russians the resettlement of 700 Cossacks in Russian-leaning Sloboda territories and, in 1636, suggested the creation of a pro-Russian Cossack regiment. His proposal was rejected by the Russians who did not want to endanger their new relationship with Poland after the recently concluded Treaty of Polyanovka. Details of his later life are unknown. Legacy and place in history Documentation of most of the details of Taras Fedorovych's life has been lost in time, including the year and circumstances of his death. There is no specific record of his activities before the mid- to late-1620s, and after 1636. The brief period, however, in which he played one of the leading roles in the region's history, established his name as an ancient and lasting source of inspiration to future generations of Ukrainians. Fedorovych is one of four Ukrainian hetmans mentioned in the original version (published in 1863) of Pavlo Chubynsky‚Äôs poem \\"Shche ne vmerla Ukraina\\" (\\"Ukraine Has Not Perished\\") which was later transformed into the Ukrainian national anthem. A quatrain of the poem reads: \\"Nalyvaiko, Zalizniak / And Taras Triasylo / Call us from beyond the grave / To the holy battle\\".

Born in Birmingham, Irving moved to Bristol in 1875, where he began working on the railways. After he lost his leg in an industrial accident, the Midland Railway forced him to take a pay cut. Angered by this injustice, he joined the Bristol Socialist Society and became an activist in a gasworkers' union, which soon merged into the National Union of Gas Workers and General Labourers. In 1892, Irving worked with Herbert V. Mills in an attempt to start a utopian socialist community at Starnthwaite, but this soon disintegrated, and Irving eventually won a legal case against Mills. Instead, he became a socialist lecturer, and then in 1894, secretary of the Burnley branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). Burnley was one of the SDF's most important branches, and Irving kept its profile high. In the 1906 general election, SDF leader H. M. Hyndman stood in the Burnley constituency, and came within 350 votes of winning the seat. In 1902, Irving was elected to Burnley Town Council, a post he held (with one gap) until 1922. In the 1906 election, Irving himself stood for Accrington; he then stood in the 1908 Manchester North West by-election, and in the January and December 1910 general elections he stood in Rochdale. While his votes varied considerably, as an SDF candidate he never came close to winning a seat. In 1911, Irving followed the SDF into the formation of the British Socialist Party. In 1914, he was a supporter of British action in World War I, and as a result, when the SDF split on the issue, he joined Hyndman's new group, the National Socialist Party. This group affiliated to the Labour Party, and as a Labour candidate he was finally able to win a Parliamentary seat, taking Burnley in the 1918 general election. He held the seat in 1922 and 1923, but remained a low-profile MP and died in 1924 aged 69.

The first member of this genus was described 1986 by Watson et al. isolated from the Gulf of Maine. The bacterium was named Nitrospira marina. Populations were initially thought to be limited to marine ecosystems, but it was later discovered to be well-suited for numerous habitats, including activated sludge of wastewater treatment systems, natural biological marine settings (such as the Seine River in France and beaches in Cape Cod), water circulation biofilters in aquarium tanks, terrestrial systems, fresh and salt water ecosystems, and hot springs. Nitrospira is a ubiquitous bacterium that plays a role in the nitrogen cycle by performing nitrite oxidation in the second step of nitrification. Nitrospira live in a wide array of environments including but not limited to, drinking water systems, waste treatment plants, rice paddies, forest soils, geothermal springs, and sponge tissue. Despite being abundant in many natural and engineered ecosystems Nitrospira are difficult to culture, so most knowledge of them is from molecular and genomic data. However, due to their difficulty to be cultivated in laboratory settings, the entire genome was only sequenced in one species, Nitrospira defluvii. In addition, Nitrospira bacteria's 16s rRNA sequences are too dissimilar to use for PCR primers, thus some members go unnoticed. In addition, members of Nitrospira with the capabilities to perform complete nitrification (Comammox bacteria) has also been discovered. Morphology For the following description, Nitrospira moscoviensis will be representative of the Nitrospira genus. Nitrospira is a gram-negative nitrite-oxidizing organism with a helical to vibroid morphology (0.9‚Äì2.2 √ó 0.2‚Äì0.4 micrometres in size). They are non-planktonic organisms that reside as clumps, known as aggregates, in biofilms. Visualization using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirms star-like protrusions on the outer membrane (6-8 nm thick). The periplasmic space is exceptionally wide (34-41 nm thick), which provides space to accommodate electron-rich molecules. Electron-deprived structures are located in the cytosol and are believed to be glycogen storage vesicles; polyhydroxybutyrate and polyphosphate granules are also identified in the cytoplasm. DNA analysis determined 56.9 +/- 0.4 mol% of the DNA to be guanine and cytosine base pairs. General Metabolism Nitrospira are capable of aerobic hydrogen oxidation and nitrite oxidation to obtain electrons, but high concentrations of nitrite have shown to inhibit their growth. The optimal temperature for nitrite oxidation and growth in Nitrospira moscoviensis is 39 ¬∞C (can range from 33-44 ¬∞C) at a pH range of 7.6-8.0 Despite being commonly classified as obligate chemolithotrophs, some are capable of mixotrophy. For instance, under different environments, Nitrospira can choose to assimilate carbon by carbon fixation or by consuming organic molecules (glycerol, pyruvate, or formate). New studies also show that Nitrospira can use urea as a source of nutrient. Urease encoded within their genome can break urea down to and ammonia. The can be assimilated by anabolism while the ammonia and organic by-product released by Nitrospira allow ammonium oxidizers and other microbes to co-exist in the same microenvironment.  Nitrification  All members of this genus have the nitrite oxidoreductase genes, and thus are all thought to be nitrite-oxidizers. Ever since nitrifying bacteria were discovered it was accepted that nitrification occurred in two steps, although it would be energetically favourable for one organism to do both steps. Recently some Nitrospira members with the abilities to perform complete nitrification (Comammox bacteria) have also been discovered. The discovery of Commamox organisms within Nitrospira redefine the way bacteria contribute to the Nitrogen cycle and thus a lot of future studies will be dedicated to it. With these new findings there's now a possibility to mainly use complete nitrification instead of partial nitrification in engineered systems like wastewater treatment plants because complete nitrification results in lower emissions of the greenhouse gases: nitrous oxide and nitric oxide, into the atmosphere.  Genome  After sequencing and analyzing the DNA of Nitrospira members researchers discovered both species had genes encoding ammonia monooxygenase (Amo) and hydroxlyamine dehydrogenase (hao), enzymes that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), use to convert ammonia into nitrite. The bacteria possess all necessary sub-units for both enzymes as well as the necessary cell membrane associated proteins and transporters to carry out the first step of nitrification. Origins of the Amo gene are debatable as one study found that it is similar to other AOB[3], while another study found the Amo gene to be genetically distinct from other lineages. Current findings indicate that the hao gene is phylogenetically distinct from the hao gene present in other AOB, meaning that they acquired them long ago, likely by horizontal gene transfer. Nitrospira also carry the genes encoding for all the sub-units of nitrite oxidoreductase (nxr), the enzyme that catalyzes the second step of nitrification.

Once widespread, its range has declined to six populations near Qinghai Lake. The gazelle was named after Nikolai Przhevalsky, a Russian explorer who collected a specimen and brought it back to St. Petersburg in 1875.Three new groups of critically endangered endemic gazelle found. Xinhua. Accessed 2008-12-10. Description Przewalski's gazelles are relatively small, slender antelopes with large eyes and short, pointed ears. The nasal bones are relatively large, suggesting an adaptation to the thin air of the Tibetan plateau. They have a head and body length of , a shoulder height of , and weigh between . Males are generally larger and heavier than the females. The tail is short, measuring only , and is often entirely hidden by fur. The animal is yellowish brown with a white underside and a white heart-shaped patch on its rump, partially bisected by a light brown vertical line. Males are darker in colour than females, and the coat of both sexes is more noticeably greyish in winter. The fur lacks an undercoat, consisting only of dense guard hairs. Male Przewalski's gazelles have ridged horns, which rise between the eyes and curve inwards at the tips; in younger males, the tips may actually touch, but they diverge as the animal ages. In the adult, the horns reach in length. The females are hornless. Przewalski's gazelle is similar in appearance to both the Tibetan gazelle and the Mongolian gazelle, to both of which it is closely related, and occurs in similar geographic areas. It is intermediate in size between the other two species, and can most easily be distinguished from them by the shape of its horns. Distribution and habitat Until the early 20th century, Przewalski's gazelle was widespread across the high plateaus of northwestern China and Inner Mongolia. However, it is now found only in a single small area around Qinghai Lake, having been extirpated across the great majority of its former range. It inhabits flat open valleys and steppeland between mountains, and the sand dunes and semi-desert zones around lakes. Two sub-species have been described, although one is now believed to be extinct: * P. przewalskii przewalskii - Qinghai * P. przewalskii diversicornis ‚Ä† - Gansu and the Ordos Loop region Behaviour and ecology The preferred diet of Pzewalski's gazelles consists of sedges and grasses, supplemented by herbs and shrubs such as Astragalus. They are often found foraging together with Tibetan gazelles, but do not compete for resources because the latter animal prefers legumes. Such associations with a related species allow for larger herds, which may help protect both species from predators. The gazelle usually travels in small groups, with rarely more than a dozen individuals, although much larger herds were reported in the 19th century, when the overall population was higher. Males are often solitary or travel in small groups of two or three individuals for much of the year, but gather together in small herds with the females during the winter rut. Przewalski's gazelles are generally quiet, but have been reported to make short bleating sounds. Reproduction Przewalski's gazelles rut from late December to early January. Males scent mark small territories and clash with rivals, fighting with their horns. Females have also been observed fighting for access to males. Courtship consists of the male moving towards the female while standing on his hind legs, and is followed by a brief copulation. Gestation lasts around six months, so that the young are born around May or June. The mother gives birth to a single offspring, usually in thickets or areas of tall grass, where they can be concealed from potential predators. The young are able to follow their mother within a few minutes of birth, although they may remain concealed for a few days before rejoining the herd. Females become fertile during their second year, around 18 months of age. The lifespan of Przewalski's gazelles is unknown, although based on that of related species, it is probably around eight years. Conservation Przewalski's gazelle is perhaps one of the most endangered species of large mammal on Earth. The many threats against the species include competition with domestic livestock and fencing of the natural habitat. These problems have become exacerbated as the area is increasingly developed as agricultural land. While now protected by Chinese law, and illegal hunting no longer is considered an important factor, a large percentage of the habitat of this species has already been lost due to human activities. Consequently, it is considered to be an endangered species by the IUCN. Formerly, it was believed that as few as 250 remained, and it was considered critically endangered. However, this is now known to be an underestimate, with new subpopulations having been discovered in 2003 and 2006, and there are now believed to be 350-400 (and possibly even more) mature individuals left.

The franchise was originally branded as Putt-Putt Golf, but with franchise expansion into family entertainment centers, many locations are currently branded as Putt-Putt Fun Centers. Concept In reaction to low-quality miniature golf courses then available, founder Don Clayton introduced a branded, \\"no-frills, all-skills\\" miniature golf concept: Standardized holes are constructed of smooth concrete covered with short nap outdoor carpet and bordered by 2x4\\" extruded aluminum barriers. Every hole is designed to be par-2, but with hole-in-one always possible with skilled putting. The franchise offers over 100 standard, copyrighted hole designs. With the focus on consistent holes and skilled play, Clayton formed the Professional Putters Association, which only competes on franchise courses. The original white and orange facilities were intentionally spartan; no landscaping other than grass and welded pipe fencing and no building other than the kiosk. However, beginning in 1986, animal statuary and other landscaping features began to be included in the franchise, but only as a decorative motif, and never a part of any of the copyrighted holes. In the 1990s, the chain expanded its franchising options to include broader family entertainment features, including game-rooms, bumper boats, batting cages, and raceways. Miniature golf vs. Putt-Putt There are several significant differences between Putt-Putt's brand of miniature golf and other versions: * Par is set at 2 without exception on each Putt-Putt hole and is so mark on franchise bumper endcaps; in other varieties of mini-golf, par can vary from 2 to 6. * Putt-Putt's short holes are designed so that a hole-in-one can be scored on each hole with a skillful putt, often through the use of banking; the (copyrighted) metal rails facilitate accurate caroms. Most mini-golf courses include holes that are impossible to ace, and those that can be aced often rely on luck due to extremely long holes and randomly placed obstacles. Additionally, the borders of each hole usually are made of rocks or uneven brick, making accurate banking difficult. * When playing Putt-Putt, a player finishes a hole before the next player takes his first putt. In miniature golf, typically, each player takes his first putt, then the player farthest from the hole takes his second putt, as in real golf. * Traditionally, Putt- Putt Golf Courses have no over-riding \\"theme\\" and have a spartan look about them. Many traditional miniature golf courses have themes (such as a story book or a religious theme), while more modern mini-golf courses twist in and around man-made mountains, lakes, caves and waterfalls, with the resulting water and elevation changes often in play. Recently, themes such as jungles and volcanos have been making their way to Putt-Putt Golf Courses, complete with caves, foliage and plaster animals, though the themes never come into play. * Obstacles in Putt-Putt are limited to small hills, metal blockers, pipes, and rarely, small water hazards. Mini-golf obstacles know no limits, including boulders, windmills and other moving obstacles, bridges, ramps and loops. * Putt-Putt Golf Courses reward holes-in-one with a ticket that typically allows the player a free game if he collects three, or in some cases a scratch-off game card. In addition, the player's ball (red, green, blue or yellow) is traded in for an orange ball, which prevents the player from claiming an additional ticket for that round. Some courses use a set of lights to allow the winning of tickets only for two colors of ball at a time, and announce the names of the golfers who score winning holes-in-one. * Generally, Putt-Putt Golf Courses are considered more appropriate for competition; miniature golf tournaments occur at Putt-Putt Golf Courses, but rare at other courses, due to the difference in skill level required. The rare ESPN- televised miniature golf tourney is always at a Putt-Putt course.

Retrieved 4 December 2006.Panaghoy sa Suba (The Call of the River) 2004 www.imdb.com Retrieved 29 November 2006. Panaghoy sa Suba is an historical romance drama about a love triangle which takes place during the Second World War. Its themes concern Filipino nationalism and the legacies of colonialism.  Plot  Loboc, River The story is set in Bohol, Central Visayas during World War II before, during, and immediately after, the Japanese Occupation of the Philippines. Duroy (Cesar Montano) is a banca operator who falls in love with Iset (Juliana Palermo), the most bewitching girl in her village. Iset is an obedient child whose father and materialistic aunt hope that she will marry the American businessman who employs her and thereby achieve wealth and status. The resident American businessman, John Smith (played by Philip Anthony), is an abusive, rude and stingy landowner. He notices Iset's beauty but sees her as a potential mistress rather than a future wife. Islet loves Duroy but obeys her parents. Ib√¥ (Reiven Bulado), Duroy's brother, is also smitten with Iset. As Duroy adores his family and does not want to get in his brother's way, he stops courting Iset. Duroy is devoted to his family, his mother (Daria Ramirez), Ib√¥ and his sister, Bikay (multi-awarded former child star Rebecca Lusterio). Heartbroken after her husband leaves for an American woman and ill, Duroy's mother dies when they run out of money to purchase her medicine. John Smith sees Ibo talking with Iset at the warehouse and shoots him on the spot. Duroy vows revenge. When the Japanese invasion begins, many men of the village flee into the mountains to become guerillas. The women and children stay, along with an American priest. John Smith is drafted into the American army and leaves. The Japanese commander who arrives notices Iset but does not attack her as many Japanese military personnel did elsewhere in the Philippines during the war. With the Japanese now in power Iset's aunt wants her to marry the officer. Several years pass before Duroy and his men launch an attack against the Japanese garrison. The Japanese responded by killing the priest and taking hostages. In 1945, a group of Filipino and American troops arrive to help the Boholano guerrilla force defeat the Japanese troops. Duroy kills the Japanese commander after a long man-against-man battle. John Smith (mockingly dubbed \\"White Balls\\" by Duroy and his friends) returns after the war expecting life to continue as it was before the Japanese invasion. Duroy attacks him but after beating Smith and thoroughly humiliating him tells Smith that he isn't worth killing him. Iset refuses John Smith's clumsy offer to renew their relationship and chooses Duroy.

After being educated in both Kamerun and Europe, he succeeded his father Manga Ndumbe Bell on 2 September 1908, styling himself after European rulers, and generally supporting the colonial German authorities. He was quite wealthy and educated, although his father left him a substantial debt. In 1910 the German Reichstag developed a plan by which the river in Duala would be moved inland to allow for wholly European riverside settlements. Manga Bell became the leader of pan-Duala resistance to the policy. He and the other chiefs at first pressured the administration through letters, petitions, and legal arguments, but these were ignored or rebutted. Manga Bell turned to other European governments for aid, and he sent representatives to the leaders of other Cameroonian peoples to suggest the overthrow of the German regime. Sultan Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum people reported his actions to the authorities, and the Duala leader was arrested. After a summary trial, Manga Bell was hanged for high treason on 8 August 1914. His actions made him a martyr in Cameroonian eyes. Writers such as Mark W. DeLancey, Mark Dike DeLancey, and Helmuth Stoecker view his actions as an early example of Cameroonian nationalism. Early life and reign Manga Bell was born in 1873 in Douala in the German colony of Kamerun. He was the eldest son of Manga Ndumbe Bell, king of the Bell lineage of the Duala people. Manga Bell was raised to appreciate both African and European ways of life. His Westernized uncle David Mandessi Bell had a great impact on him,Austen and Derrick 126. and as a youth he attended school in both Douala and Germany.DeLancey and DeLancey 168. During the 1890s he attended the Gymnasium of Ulm, Germany, although no direct record of his time there survives. Manga Bell was made Ein-J√§hriger, indicating that he held a certificate for education beyond the primary level but below the Abitur earned for completion of secondary studies.Austen and Derrick 221 note 167. When the prince returned to Kamerun, he was one of the most highly educated men in the colony by Western standards.Austen and Derrick 132. He made other periodic visits to Europe, such as when he travelled to Berlin, Germany, and Manchester, England, with his father in 1902. In Manchester, he met the mayor at town hall and was mentioned in the October edition of the African Times (where the editor doubted that he and his father were actual royalty).Brunschwig 54; Green 23. Manga Bell married Emily Engome Dayas, the daughter of an English trader and a Duala woman. When his father died on 2 September 1908, Manga Bell succeeded as the king of the Duala Bell lineage. He was traditionally installed on 2 May 1910 by the paramount chief of Bonaberi.Ngoh 350. Manga Bell inherited an 8,000 mark pension,Brunschwig 54. cocoa and timber interests in the Mungo River valley, property and real estate in Douala,Austen and Derrick 130, 132 and a lucrative position as head of an appeals court with jurisdiction over the Cameroon littoral.Austen 14. His father and grandfather, Ndumbe Lobe Bell, left him in a strong political position with Bell dominant over the other Duala lineages. However, his father also left him a substantial debt of 7,000 marks.Austen and Derrick 132‚Äì3. Rudolf Duala Manga Bell was forced to rent buildings to European interests and move his own offices inland to the Douala neighbourhood of Bali.Austen and Derrick 133. He owned 200 hectares of cocoa plantations in 1913, a large amount by Duala standards;Clarence-Smith 157. his debt had been reduced to 3,000 marks by 13 July 1912.Austen and Derrick 221 note 169. Manga Bell's reign was European in character. His relations with the Germans were largely positive, and he was viewed as a good citizen and collaborator. Nevertheless, at times he ran afoul of the colonial administrators. In 1910, for example, the German authorities arrested him and accused him (with no proof) of collusion with a large bank robbery. Duala land problem Wouri estuary showing Duala settlements around 1850 Manga Bell's real problems with the regime began later in 1910. The Germans outlined a plan to relocate the Duala people inland from the Wouri River to allow European-only settlement of the area. The expropriations affected all of the Duala lineages except Bonaberi, so Duala public opinion was strongly against it, and for the first time in their history, the Duala clans presented a united front. Manga Bell's position as leader of the dominant Bell clan, coupled with his character, education, and finances, made him a natural leader for this opposition. Manga Bell and other Duala rulers sent a letter to the Reichstag in November 1911 to protest the land seizures. The Germans were surprised at Manga Bell's involvement, but they ignored the complaint. The chiefs sent another letter in March 1912. Still, the Germans moved forward with their plan on 15 January 1913.Ngoh 106‚Äì7. The chiefs warned in writing on 20 February 1913 that this violation \\"may well prompt the natives to consider whether it might be wiser under the circumstances to revoke the [German-Duala Treaty of 1884 and enter into a treaty with another power.\\"Stoecker 172. Manga Bell argued that the expropriation plan ignored the treaty's promise \\"that the land cultivated by us now and the places the towns are built on shall be the property of the present owners and their successors\\"Quoted in Stoecker 172. and contradicted statements by Governor Theodor Seitz that he would leave Bell lands alone as he constructed a railroad in the colony.Austen and Derrick 129, Ngoh 107. The Germans countered that the German-Duala treaty gave them the authority to manage Duala lands as they saw fit. That August, they removed Manga Bell from office and from the civil service and stripped him of his annual pension of 3,000 marks.Austen and Derrick 135, Ngoh 108. In his place, they propped up his brother, Henri Lobe Bell.Austen and Derrick 144. The Reichstag debated the expropriation for the first half of 1914. Manga Bell enlisted the aid of Hellmut von Gerlach, a German journalist. Gerlach managed to secure a suspension order from the Reichstag Budget Commission in March, but the order was overturned when Colonial Secretary Wilhelm Solf convinced elements of the press, businessmen in the colony, politicians, and other groups to finally rally behind the expropriation. Manga Bell and the Duala requested permission to send envoys to Germany to plead their case, but the authorities denied them.Ngoh 107. In secret, Manga Bell sent Adolf Ngoso Din to Germany to hire a lawyer for the Duala and pursue the matter in court.Austen and Derrick 128; Ngoh 74, 107 The desperate yet motivated Manga Bell, turned to other European governments and to the leaders of other African ethnic groups for support.Austen and Derrick 128‚Äì9; Dorward 421. The contents of his correspondence with European powers are unknown; he may have simply sought to spread word of his cause.Austen and Derrick 136. His envoys to African leaders reached Bali, Balong, Dschang, Foumban, Ngaound√©r√©, Yabassi, and Yaound√©. Karl Atangana, leader of the Ewondo and Bane peoples, kept Manga Bell's plan secret but urged the Duala leader to reconsider.Quinn 99. In Bulu lands on the other hand, Martin-Paul Samba agreed to contact the French for military support if Manga Bell petitioned the British.Austen and Derrick 136, Ngoh 108. However, there is no evidence that Manga Bell ever did so.Austen 21. In Foumban, Ibrahim Njoya, sultan of the Bamum people, rejected the plan and informed the Basel Mission on 27 April 1914 that Manga Bell was planning a pan-Kamerun rebellion. The missionaries alerted the Germans. As King Manga Bell was prosecuted under the German occupation, he found a refuge by his relative and best friend, King Ekandjoum Joseph. The latter also claimed the rights of his kingdom and his Moungo people. Historians are split on the nature of Manga Bell's actions. Mark W. DeLancey and Mark Dike DeLancey name him \\"an early nationalist\\", and Helmuth Stoecker says that his actions \\"had begun to organize a resistance movement embracing the whole of Cameroon and cutting across tribal differences\\". However, Ralph A. Austen and Jonathan Derrick argue that \\"it is unlikely that any such radical action against the European regime was intended.\\"DeLancey and DeLancey 168, Austen and Derrick 136. On 6 May 1914 Bezirksamtmann Herrmann R√∂hm wrote to the Kuti Agricultural Station (where Manga Bell's envoy was being held), > We are not confronted with any direct danger of some kind of violent action > by the Duala. For now the main value of the statements from Ndane [the envoy > to Njoya] lies in the fact that they contain material for proceeding against > those chiefs who are guilty of actual deliberate agitation in refusal of the > expropriation and of resistance that reaches all the way over to > Germany.Letter quoted in Austen and Derrick 136. Manga Bell's funeral On 1 June 1914 R√∂hm wrote to the administration in Buea that based on his calculations of Manga Bell's annual income from cocoa and timber exports, and accounting for his debts to European interests, the Duala merchants would likely not see it in their interests to oppose the expropriation further.Austen and Derrick 130. At the urging of Solf, the Germans arrested Manga Bell and Ngoso Din and charged them with high treason.Austen and Derrick 128; Stoecker 173. Their trial was held on 7 August 1914.Ngoh 115. World War I had just begun, and an attack by the Allied West Africa Campaign in Kamerun was imminent; accordingly, the trial was rushed. No direct record of the proceedings survives. The dossier of evidence used against Manga Bell claimed that he had been raising funds from inland and that his outspoken opposition was causing unrest among the inland peoples. The regime claimed that Manga Bell had admitted to contacting foreign countries for aid against Germany, but a 1927 recollection by the official defense attorney‚Äîriddled as it is with inaccuracies and racist statements‚Äîclaims that Manga Bell maintained his innocence throughout.Austen and Derrick 222 note 179. Requests for the accused men's lives to be spared came from Heinrich Vieter of the Catholic Pallottine Mission, the Basel Mission, and the Baptist Mission, but Governor Karl Ebermaier rejected their pleas.Ngoh 74, 115; Austen and Derrick 222 note 177. On 8 August 1914,Austen and Derrick 129 and Ngoh 115 both support this date; DeLancey and DeLancey 168 give the date as 14 August. Rudolf Duala Manga Bell and Adolf Ngoso Din were hanged. The Allies captured Douala seven weeks later on 27 September 1914.Austen and Derrick 138. Legacy Manga Bell's execution made him a martyr to the people of Cameroon and painted the Duala as an heroic people.Austen and Derrick 129. His story became legend and came to represent \\"the myth of extreme colonial oppression, based upon the catastrophic climax of German rule in Douala\\".Austen and Derrick 93. Manga Bell was still popular well into the 1920s. \\"Tet'Ekombo\\", a hymn to him composed in 1929, has remained popular. In 1935 his body was exhumed and reburied behind his house in Bonanjo, Douala. An obelisk was erected there on 8 August 1936, the 20th anniversary of his execution.Austen and Derrick 171. The Germans and later colonial powers in Cameroon became wary of the Duala and never again allowed a powerful chieftaincy to take hold among them.Austen and Derrick 135. After the French became the colonial power in French Cameroun after World War I, Rudolf Duala Manga Bell's brother Richard Ndumbe Manga Bell continued to fight to regain the lost Duala lands.Hill 150 note 2. Manga Bell's son Alexandre Douala Manga Bell took office under the French in 1951. His father's reputation as a Duala martyr lent Alexandre Douala Manga Bell great standing among the Duala.Austen 15. Cameroon faced a long civil war when the outlawed nationalist Union des Populations du Cameroun political party in the 1950s and '60s waged its maquis against French and Cameroonian forces. As a result, overt nationalist sentiment was shunned and figures such as Manga Bell were largely forgotten or only briefly treated in history books. However, signs show that Cameroon is coming to grips with its nationalistic past;Bayart 43. for example, in March 1985 the √âcole Militaire Inter-Armes, part of the military of Cameroon named a graduating class of cadet officers after Manga Bell.

The broader site is a prehistoric Celtic complex from the Late Hallstatt and Early La T√®ne periods, consisting of a fortified settlement and several burial mounds. The grave of the Lady of Vix, dating to circa 500 BC, had never been disturbed and thus contained remarkably rich grave offerings. Known in French as the Tr√©sor de Vix, these included a great deal of jewellery and the \\"Vix krater\\", the largest known metal vessel from Western classical antiquity, being 1.63 m (5'4\\") in height.Vix-Mus√©e-du-Pays- Ch√¢tillonnais: Tr√©sor-de-Vix  Location  The sites are located near the village of Vix, about 6 km north of Ch√¢tillon-sur-Seine, in the department of C√¥te-d'Or, in northeastern Burgundy. The complex is centred on Mont Lassois, a steep flat-topped hill that dominates the area. It was the site of a fortified Celtic settlement, or oppidum. To the southeast of the hill, there was a 42-hectare necropolis with graves ranging from the Late Bronze Age via the Hallstatt Culture to Late La T√®ne. Other finds indicate activity up to Late Antiquity.Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft \\"Early centralization and urbanization processes - On the Genesis and Development 'Early Celtic Princely Seats' : Mont Lassois During the sixth and fifth centuries BC, the Vix (or Mont Lassois) settlement appears to have controlled a major trading node, where the Seine, an important riverine transport route linking eastern and western France, crossed the land route leading from the Mediterranean to northern Europe. Additionally, Vix is at the centre of an agriculturally rich plain.  History of discovery  Vix krater: Frieze of hoplites and four- horse chariots on the rim Discovery of archaeological material in the area, originally by a locally based amateur, began in April 1930. Increasingly systematic work throughout the following decades revealed thousands of pottery sherds, fibulae, jewellery, and other bronze and iron finds. The famous burial mound with the krater was excavated in early 1953 by Ren√© Joffroy. In 1991 new archaeological research on and around Mont Lassois began under the direction of Bruno Chaume. Since 2001 a programme of research titled ‚ÄúVix et son environnement‚Äù began, uniting the resources of several universities.  The oppidum of Mont Lassois  Fortifications and architecture Vix palace, late 6th century B.C. Vix palace, late 6th century B.C. Excavation of the settlement on the summit of Mont Lassois revealed extensive fortifications, with ditches and walls up to 8 m thick. The walls were built in the Pfostenschlitzmauer technique, but also yielded nails of the type common in murus gallicus walls. Excavation inside the enclosure revealed a variety of buildings, including post houses, pit dwellings, hearths, and storage units built on stilts. Geophysical work shows a large planned settlement, with a central, north‚Äìsouth axis and several phases of buildings. The \\"Palace of the Lady of Vix\\" In 2006, a remarkable architectural unit was discovered at the centre of the site. It is a large complex of two or three buildings, the main one measuring 35 by 21 m, with an estimated height of 12 m: the dimensions of a modern church. The large hall had an apse at the back and a front porch in antis. Overall, the central unit resembles the megaron complex of early Greek architecture. Such a find is unprecedented in early Celtic Europe. Finds suggested domestic use or feasting uses. The structure has been described as the \\"Palace\\" of the Lady of Vix (Palais de la Dame de Vix). Finds The many individual finds from the Lassois oppidum clearly demonstrate the settlement's long and wide-ranging trade contacts, as well as its own role as an economic centre. The most common finds are shards of pottery, with more than 40,000 recorded to date. Many are local products, decorated with simple geometric motifs (checkerboard patterns) and occasional depictions of animals. There also have been finds of imported Attic black figure vases from Greece. Many amphorae and bowls could be identified as coming from the contemporary Greek-settled areas of southern France. The amphorae had been used for transporting wine. Jewellery included fibulae, commonly decorated with amber or coral, earrings, beads, slate bracelets, and rings. Glass ornaments also were found. Some small bronze figurines found are probably of Mediterranean origin. Little weaponry has been found as yet, the majority of it projectiles and axes. Status Mont Lassois has all the features of a high-status settlement: large fortifications, the presence of a citadel and a lower town, rare and fine imported materials, as well as numerous rich burial mounds in the vicinity. The burial mounds  The 1953 Vix Grave  lioness The burial of \\"the Lady of Vix\\" took place around 500 B.C. Although decomposition of the organic contents of the grave was nearly total, the gender of the individual buried has been interpreted as female: she is accompanied by many items of jewellery, but no weaponry. Her social status is not clear and other than \\"Lady,\\" names such as, Queen, Princess, or Priestess of Vix have all been used in various articles involving conjecture. There can be no doubt of her high status, as indicated by the large amounts of jewellery. She was between 30 years and 35 years old at the time of her death. Burial and grave goods A unique 24 carat Celtic torc, whose ends are adorned with winged horses on intricate filigree pedestals and lion paws, inspired by Etruscan, Scythian or Middle Eastern bestiary The inhumation burial was placed in a 4m x 4m rectangular wooden chamber underneath a mound or tumulus of earth and stone which originally measured 42m in diameter and 5m in height. Her body was laid in the freestanding box of a cart, or chariot, the wheels of which had been detached and placed beside it. Only its metal parts have survived. Her jewellery included a 480 gram 24-carat gold torc, a bronze torc, six fibulae, six slate bracelets, plus a seventh bracelet made of amber beads. The grave also contained an assemblage of imported objects from Italy and the Greek world, all of them associated with the preparation of wine. They included the famous krater (see below), a silver phiale (shallow bowl, sometimes seen as a local product), an Etruscan bronze oinochoe (wine jug), and several drinking cups from Etruria and Attica. One of the latter was dated as c. 525 BC and represents the latest firmly dated find in the grave. It thus provides the best evidence, a terminus post quem for its date. The vessels probably were placed on wooden tables or benches that did not survive. The Vix krater A Gorgon head is on the outside of each of the krater's two handles The largest and most famous of the finds from the burial is an elaborately decorated bronze volute krater of 1.63 m (5'4\\") height and over 200 kg (450 lbs) weight. Kraters were vessels for mixing wine and water, common in the Greek world, and usually made of clay. The Vix krater has become an iconic object representing both the wealth of early Celtic burials and the art of Late Archaic Greek bronze work. *The krater was made of seven or more individual pieces with alphabetical markingsCook, R. M. 1979. \\"Three Conjectures\\". Journal of Hellenic Studies 99. 152‚Äì155., indicating that it probably was transported to Burgundy in pieces and assembled in situ. *The vase proper, made of a single sheet of hammered bronze, weighs about 60 kg. Its bottom is rounded, its maximum diameter is 1.27 m, and its capacity is 1,100 litres. Its walls are only 1 mm to 1.3 mm thick. The krater was found crushed by the weight of the tumulus material above it. It had telescoped completely: the handles were found at the same level as the base. It was restored after excavation. *Its foot is made of a single moulded piece, its diameter is 74 cm, its weight 20.2 kg. It received the rounded bottom of the main vase and ensured its stability. It is decorated with stylised plant motifs. *The three handles, supported by rampant lionesses, weighed about 46 kg each. Each is a 55 cm high volute, each is elaborately decorated with a grimacing gorgon, a common motif on contemporary Greek bronzes. *A frieze of hoplites decorates the neck of the vessel, which is made of a bronze ring inserted into the main vase and supporting the handles. It depicts eight chariots, each drawn by four horses and conducted by a charioteer (depicted smaller than the hoplites for reasons of space), each is followed by a single fully armed hoplite on foot. The frieze is an important example of early Greek bronze relief art, which has rarely survived. *The lid was a hammered bronze sheet, weighing 13.8kg and shaped to fit the krater's opening. It is concave and perforated by multiple holes, probably because it also served as a strainer for purifying wine. A protrusion at its centre supports a 19cm statuette of moulded bronze, depicting a woman with one outstretched arm, which once may have held some object such as a plastinx. She wears a peplos, the body-length Ancient Greek garment worn by women, and her head is covered by a veil. The statuette appears of a somewhat older style than figures on the rest of the vessel. Significance The enormous variety of apparently Mediterranean imports indicates wide-ranging trade connections; in particular, the Mediterranean material might have come to Vix with Greek or Etruscan traders. The wealth of imported luxury goods at Vix is, so far, unique in La T√®ne Europe. It has been suggested that the krater, the largest known Greek bronze vessel, should be seen in a context of high-status gift exchange connected with the trade of wine from the Mediterranean for raw materials from northern Europe. Exhibition and reconstruction A reconstruction of the grave and the original finds are on display in the museum at Ch√¢tillon-sur- Seine.Vix-Mus√©e-du-Pays-Ch√¢tillonnais: Tr√©sor-de-Vix  Further tumuli  Apart from this woman's grave (mound I), there are five further known large burial mounds in the area. Three of them have been excavated so far. *Mound II had a diameter of 33 m; its central chamber contained an urn with cremated human remains, dated by accompanying finds to c. 850 BC. *The mound of La Butte probably dates to the mid-sixth century. As in its famous neighbouring grave, it contained a woman laid in a cart, or chariot, accompanied by two iron axes and a gold bracelet. *A third mound, at La Garenne, was destroyed in 1846. It, too, contained a cart, as well as an Etruscan bronze bowl with four griffin or lioness handles. It is not known whether it contained skeletal remains. Statues In 1994, fragments of two stone statues, a warrior, and a figure of a woman, were discovered in a small enclosure. Significance A Hoplite (probably Spartan), on the Vix Krater. In the area, as elsewhere in Central and Western Europe, the early Iron Age led to changes in social organisation, including a marked tendency toward the development of social hierarchies. It seems that at the top of these hierarchies was an aristocracy that had developed in the context of the increasingly important trade in iron ore and iron. Whether they really were \\"princesses\\" or \\"princes\\" in a modern sense (i.e., a noble or religious aristocracy) or simply represented an economic or mercantile elite is still the subject of much discussion. Evidence for these changed social conditions is seen in the richly equipped graves of this period, which stand in sharp contrast to the preceding habit of uniform simple urn burials. It is also seen in the changing settlement patterns of the region. Whereas large open settlements had previously served as central places, smaller enclosed settlements developed, often in locally prominent locations (so called manors or princely sites). Several of these sites are known from Late Hallstatt and Early La T√®ne Europe, for example, the burials at Hochdorf and Magdalenenberg, the Heuneburg settlement and the Glauberg settlement and burial complex. Iron ores were far more widespread than the rarer materials needed to produce the previously dominant bronze: copper, but especially, tin. Thus, economic success ceased to be determined simply by access to the raw materials, but started to depend on infrastructure and trade. The increasing economic surplus in well-situated places was invested in representative settlements (and fortifications), jewellery, and expensive imported luxury materials, a differentiation not previously possible.

It, and parts of nearby Beresfield, was originally known as Upper Hexham, \\"lower\\" Hexham being an older settlement located about to the east on the Hunter River. The name \\"Tarro\\" reportedly means \\"stone\\" in an Aboriginal language. At the 2006 census, Tarro had a population of 1,558, almost all of which is concentrated in the south-western corner of the suburb. Geography Tarro and the adjacent suburbs of Beresfield, Woodberry and Thornton are situated on low ridges rising out of the surrounding floodplain (and wetlands) of the Hunter River. Early Tarro compromised a number of scattered farms which made use of the surrounding wetlands. Housing was otherwise strung out along Maitland Road (then the New England Highway, now Anderson Drive) between the railway station in the east to what was to become Beresfield in the west. After World War II, Tarro became increasingly suburban. The area bounded by Eastern, Western and Southern Avenues was subdivided. This was followed by land between Christie Road and Maitland Road, then in the late 1960s-1970s land between Western Avenue and Christie Road and then behind the Tarro Hotel. In mid-1980s land between Christie Road and Beresfield was sold off to L.J Hooker, then known as Hooker Homes, where more residential homes were built, all following the same basic design. Modern Tarro includes a section of the Hunter River, located in the eastern and southeastern parts of the suburb. The suburb extends along the Hunter River in the southeast to the Hexham bridges, where it meets the suburb of Kooragang. Despite their name, the Hexham bridges are actually located in Tarro, the southbound bridge forming the border between Tarro and Kooragang. The southern and northern approaches to the bridges, on the Pacific Highway, are in Hexham and Tomago respectively. History Indigenous past The area where Tarro is located originally was part of the territory of the Pambalong clan of the Awabakal people. The land of the Pambalong stretched from Newcastle West, extended along the southern bank of the Hunter River, west through Hexham (Tarro) to Buttai and across to the foothills of Keeba- Keeba (Mount Sugarloaf) to the northern tip of Lake Macquarie and back to Newcastle West. The country of the Pambalong was known as Barrahineban. Churches Tarro Catholic Church and School In 1841 Edward Sparke Snr, original settler and owner of \\"Woodlands\\" conveyed of land on the High Road to the Church of England and the Bishop of Australia. During the same year he donated to the Lord Bishop of Australia, William Grant Broughton, for a burial ground. In 1842 Sparke and his wife Mary, with the approval of Robert Scott the mortgagee, sold Bishop Broughton four acres \\"on which a Parsonage House is now built\\", commencing at the north east corner of the Township of Upper Hexham, for ¬£100, \\"for erection and completion of Parsonage\\".Hartley, Dulcie, \\"Men of Their Time - Pioneers of The Hunter River\\" page 21 [1995] A church, named St Stephens, was opened in Tarro around 1849. This rustic structure, was replaced by a more elegant wooden building in 1905. There was also a parsonage. This church was later joined by Sunday school hall in the 1960s. Next door was tennis court, which was later replaced by a youth centre in the early 1970s. Around 1980 St Stephens was sold and removed. The site of the church is now the site of the Tarro Interchange with the New England Highway. Tarro's old pioneer cemetery is on Quarter Sessions Road with burials dating from the mid nineteenth century. The foundation stone for Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church at 42 Anderson Drive was laid on 4 December 1922. Post office Old Tarro Post office Tarro's first post office was named Upper Hexham and was located at the railway station. Around 1918 the post office moved to Woodberry Road, and later to 13 Maitland Road (now Anderson Drive). The post office housed the manual telephone switchboard until automatic switching was introduced in 1957. The post office closed on 30 July 1993 and Tarro is now served by Beresfield Post Office. Railway Tarro has a railway station, which opened in 1857 with the Newcastle-Maitland railway - the first section of the Main North line from Sydney to the New England region. The station is one of the oldest in Australia, being the original eastern terminus for the Hunter Valley Railway before it was extended to Newcastle. It was originally known as Hexham when it opened in 1857. In 1871 the name was changed to Hexham Township and then Tarro. The station is now served by NSW TrainLink's Hunter line. The railway station was once quite large with a timber and glazed station master's office and signal room as well as brick ticket offices and waiting rooms on the Maitland-bound platform and a smaller timber ticket office and waiting room on the Newcastle-bound platform. After suffering vandalism in the 1970s, these buildings were demolished and replaced by simple weathersheds. At one time there were loading ramps to the west of the railway station and roadbridge which were used to load coal in the 1940s from a small mine, Kent Colliery, at Beresfield. Some evidence of these ramps still remains. Demographics According to the 2016 Census the median age in Tarro is 45. The population of the suburb is 1,645, a slight increase from 1,641 in 2011. 5.1% of residents are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander with the median age among this group being 19. Tarro has a higher proportion (24.4%) of residents aged 65+ than the national average (15.8%). 86.3% of residents report being born in Australia; significantly higher than the national average of 66.7%. The most common other countries of birth are England (2.5%), New Zealand (0.9%) and Taiwan (0.8%). The most common reported ancestries in Tarro are English, Australian and Irish. 75.2% of residents reported having both parents born in Australia; considerably higher than the national average of 47.3%. The top religious groups in Tarro are Anglican 28.6%, Catholic 20.5% and Uniting Church 6.7%. 24.7% stated no religion and 8.7% did not answer the question. Education Upper Hexham Public School, opened in 1881 The first school in Tarro was held in the home of the Anglican Reverend Bolton in 1844. Around 1860, a school house was opened, opposite St Stephens' Church, on the northern side of Maitland Road.Orchard, Gail, God's Acre: Religion Comes to the Bend in the River, p.14 A Government operated public school opened in Upper Hexham in 1881. This eventually became Beresfield Public School. The original schoolhouse is now in the grounds of Beresfield Public School at 181 Anderson Drive. The schoolhouse is now heritage listed. A second public primary school was built in Tarro proper, opening in 1961. Tarro also has a Catholic primary school, adjoining Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church. The nearest public secondary school is Francis Greenway High School at Beresfield. The high school is named after convict architect Francis Greenway who was granted land in the Tarro area around 1820. Other facilities Water Pumping Station Tarro has a newsagency-general store, butcher's shop, take-away food store, petrol station, hotel and motel. There is also a fire station, community hall, Telstra telephone exchange, pumping station and depot belonging to the Hunter Water Corporation, electricity sub-station and a number of small churches. The pumping station is heritage listed. Tarro Park sports ground, largely reclaimed from wetlands, has several soccer and football fields, a playground and bird ponds. Tarro's second smaller park, opposite the community hall on Northern avenue was resumed by the catholic school in the 2000s and fenced to prevent public access. Police station Tarro previously had a police station which closed in 1976, with the area then to be served from Beresfield police station. The Beresfield police station currently operates on a part-time basis with the main coverage of the area being provided from Maitland Police station. War memorial Following World War I, Tarro and the nearby community of Woodberry established a memorial to veterans. The memorial was unveiled by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Nicholson, Member for Maitland, on behalf of Woodberry and Tarro residents about 1920. The memorial lists 14 veterans, including five killed in action The memorial was relocated & rededicated by D J Shearman in December 1974. The memorial can now be seen at the Fred Harvey Oval, Lawson Avenue, Woodberry.

They are most prominently known for their vocal and creative support of Aztec athletics, especially the men's basketball team. The Show's uniqueness and creativity sets them apart from other student sections. They came up with the idea to wave giant cut-out faces during free throws. They have come up with numerous chants and traditions. The Show has three designated sections in Viejas Arena, sections M, L, and K, which are located behind the basket near the visiting team's bench. They stress creativity rather than uniformity. Their website has sections for their history, media, gameday, blog and message boards. Name During the early days of The Show, a fan posted on an SDSU sports message board, \\"You guys think you're the whole show.\\" It was this statement that led to the raucous student section taking the name \\"The Show.\\" Early history The history of The Show can be traced back to the 2001‚Äì2002 men's basketball season. With 1997 opening of Cox Arena, now called Viejas Arena, the men's and women's basketball teams moved across the street from Peterson Gym. Two years later, SDSU moved to the Mountain West Conference. Also occurring that year was the hiring of former University of Michigan head men's basketball coach, Steve Fisher. The teams struggled during Fisher's first two years at SDSU, winning 5 and 14 games respectively. It was during the 2001‚Äì02 season that the program turned around. Led by Al Faux, Tony Bland, and Randy Holcomb, the team finished with a 10‚Äì4 conference record, and going 21‚Äì12 overall. This was the best record for the school in nearly 20 years. It was during that season that The Show was formed by a small group of 6‚Äì8 fans came together to support the team. Some were SDSU students, while some were still in high school. During the 2002 Mountain West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, SDSU pulled off a major upset as the number five seed. In three straight days, SDSU beat four seed BYU, one seed Wyoming, and were set to face hometown favorite UNLV in the finals. With the Aztecs holding onto a slim lead as the clock counted down, SDSU fans began to line up on the baseline to rush the court. Right as the final buzzer was about to sound, football player Akbar Gbaja-Biamila looked over to a Rebel fan and stated, \\"Remember this day, when the Aztecs came into your arena and rushed onto your court!\\" The buzzer sounded and SDSU had just won their first Mountain West Conference tournament title and were set to go to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. It was on this trip to Chicago that the casual group of friends formed the foundation of what would become The Show. The Show attempts to force an opponents' missed free throw Big heads Before the 2002-2003 basketball season, a member of The Show was watching the movie BASEketball, in which opposing players do whatever it takes to distract each other while they shoot. He took this strategy and combined it with the use of athletes' and celebrities' cardboard heads on Pardon the Interruption. It was during a road game at Long Beach State that the first Big Head in college basketball history was used. As a Long Beach player stepped to the free throw line, The Show member revealed a large cutout of an unflattering version of Michael Jackson. The Long Beach player took a double take, bent over laughing, and missed the free throw. Since then The Show has added more and more heads every year. As of the 2011-12 San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball season, The Show has an estimated 125 big heads used during games. The heads are distributed throughout the lower part of the section at halftime, and are used during the second half of home games when the opponent is at the free throw line. Since appearing in ESPN The Magazine's December 19, 2005 issue, which documented the origins of the heads, student sections all over the country have joined the trend including Kansas and Marquette. Costumes Costumes have been an important part of The Show since the founding. While many student sections feel the need to dress up in uniformity, The Show prides itself on its creativity and individuality. In fact, one of the Show Commandments reads \\"Thou shalt wear two types of attire to games: red and black, or whatever the hell you want. 'Show' clothing is designed to be as funny, ludicrous and intimidating as possible. Costumes, outfits, and any accessories you can dream up are definitely encouraged.\\" Conor Mongon, one of the original Show members was quoted saying, \\"we liken it almost to a Mardi Gras parade. Everyone‚Äôs out there having fun, going crazy.\\" ESPN columnist Dana O'Neil describes The Show as, \\"the nonsensical, whimsical, illogical student section at San Diego State, where no costume is deemed too strange.\\" Many of The Show's costumes from recent years have been posted in a blog on The Show's Wordpress page. Songs and chants The Show is rich in tradition with coming up with creative chants and songs for games. The list of songs/chants includes: * Aztecs Bombaye ‚Äì Stemming from the 1974 Rumble in the Jungle fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, Ali was greeted with chants of \\"Ali bombaye! Ali bombaye!\\" which means \\"Ali kill him!\\" or \\"Ali defeat him!\\" It was during the 2005 SDSU- BYU football game that \\"Aztecs Bombaye (pronounced Boom-Bye-Yay)\\" began. An African exchange student started shouting \\"Aztecs bombaye!\\" to pump up the SDSU players. Every time the student started the chant, something good happened for the Aztecs. The Show would later adopt it for basketball games. Not to use up all of its luck, The Show would only use the chant in dire situations, when the team needed a stop. * \\"Tarzan Boy\\" by Baltimora ‚Äì A Show staple for years. * \\"I believe that we will win!\\" ‚Äì During the 2010‚Äì11 season, The Show put their own spin on the chant, started at Navy and adopted by Utah State. The Show has famous SDSU alumni as guests and help lead the chant before the game. The next year, SDSU used the chant as a basis for their marketing campaign including a nationally aired 30 second commercial where SDSU students, alumni including Ralph Rubio and Jerry Sanders, and San Diego residents chanted it. * \\"Uprising\\" by Muse ‚Äì Started during the 2010 Mountain West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. A Show member heard the song playing at the Thomas & Mack Center and since then, The Show has sung the chorus before games accompanied by the Aztec Pep Band, and a cappella at random points during games. Currently the song is performed immediately after the I Believe chant. * \\"Bro Hymn\\" by Pennywise ‚Äì Started during the 2011‚Äì12 season, the Aztec Pep band plays the song as the team's entrance music as The Show sings along to the beat. * \\"Seven Nation Army\\" by The White Stripes ‚Äì Also started during the 2011‚Äì12 season, The Show started doing an a cappella version of the beat. Twitter The Show has a Twitter page under the handle @TheShowSDSU that is updated regularly with general athletics information, trash talk about other schools, and other topics. Currently, the account has over 15,000 followers. Under the original handle \\"The__Show\\", the original purpose of the account was to tweet out the scores of basketball games. Banner During the 2011-12 season, The Show introduced a giant banner into their repertoire. The banner was paid for by Associated Students of SDSU and made its debut at home game against UNLV on January 14, 2012. A few minutes before tip-off, the Show reveals the banner, covering the front section. The banner remains up until the team comes onto the court. Controversy Standing behind the mantra \\"No one likes us. We don't care,\\" The Show has a history of approaching, if not crossing the line on occasion. The first controversial act by The Show was during a 2010 game against former Mountain West Conference rival BYU, a school that is owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church, or Mormons). For this home game, several dozen Show members dressed up in Mormon missionary apparel, wearing white button-down shirts, black ties, and bike helmets. This move was criticized by Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis. He is described the stunt as a \\"Totally classless move by several dozen San Diego State students who dressed up as Mormon missionaries to mock BYU when the Cougars came to town on Saturday night. Riding the opposition is fine, but there are a few things that are off-limits, and religion is of them.\\" Near the end of the game, with SDSU losing, fans started chanting \\"You're still Mormon.\\" During this game, one sign came under fire for being over the line. It said, \\"Which wife gave you mono?\\" This was referencing both Jimmer Fredette's recent bout with mononucleosis and polygamy in early LDS history. The BYU player saw the sign and laughed it off. The next season, both teams ranked in the top 10 in the nation during their meeting at Viejas. Weeks before the game, an SDSU student tried to get in Jimmer's head by creating a Facebook event that invited students to ‚ÄúPoke Jimmer Fredette‚Äôs girlfriend because Jimmer can‚Äôt poke her for himself.‚Äù In the description, students were told the mission was to \\"disrupt, upset, distract and irritate (the) opponent.‚Äù More than 7,000 people were invited to the event, which had a picture of Jimmer's girlfriend (now wife) Whitney Wonnacott and her Facebook profile. Other students started selling \\"I poked Jimmer's girlfriend\\" shirts. These shirts were banned for the game, yet a few students managed to sneak in with them. For the game, hundreds of Show members dressed up in Mormon gear, despite a letter emailed to students from coach Fisher, where he said, \\"We know that the energy and enthusiasm brought by The Show is what makes Viejas Arena one of the toughest home courts in the country. It is important to remember that when you are in the student section, you represent something greater than yourself. You represent San Diego State... We cannot cross the line into topics that are out of bounds and distasteful, particularly making fun of one‚Äôs religion.\\" During this game, there were many signs and posters referencing Mormonism, including \\"Hi mom(s),\\" \\"Jimmer Freddette is a false idol,\\" and \\"Aztec basketball is my religion.\\" During the 2012 Mountain West Conference Tournament, members of The Show sent out tweets from The Show's Twitter account that made fun of a camera shot of UNLV's legendary basketball coach, Jerry Tarkanian. Some of the tweets sent out included ‚ÄúWill Tark be alive by Saturday to see us storm the court for a 3rd straight year?‚Äù ‚ÄúTarkanian makes Tom Ables (SDSU‚Äôs dedicated senior citizen fan) looks like Channing Tatum.‚Äù and ‚ÄúTarkanian looks like dog (bleep).‚Äù San Diego Union-Tribune writer Don Norcross responded by writing an article saying the tweets were sent in poor taste.

Menzies used the speech to outline the values and constituency that would form the basis of the Liberal Party of Australia.

Successful tests in laboratories holding national accreditation for testing and certification result in the issuance of a certification listing. The listing is public domain, whereas the test report itself is proprietary information belonging to the test sponsor. There are many different types of fire tests apart from those on firestops. Walls and floors themselves can be tested, closures within them, such as windows, fire doors, fire dampers, structural steel, and more. Fire tests are conducted both on active fire protection and on passive fire protection items. Each have different test methods and scales. There are full- scale, small-scale and bench-scale tests. There are tests on systems, such as the one below, but there are also tests on materials, such as intumescents, to be sure of components that may be used within a system. Fire testing must consider all applicable provisions of the intended product certification. It is also prudent to test products in such a manner as to ensure ease of use and broad, economical applications with regards to listing and approval use and compliance.  Examples of fire testing for products and systems  * ASTM E84 Standard Test Method for Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials, also known as the Steiner tunnel test * ASTM E1354 Standard Test Method for Heat and Visible Smoke Release Rates for Materials and Products Using an Oxygen Consumption Calorimeter * ASTM E1354 Standard Test Method for Determining Flammability Characteristics of Plastics and Other Solid Materials Using Microscale Combustion Calorimetry * ASTM D2863 Standard Test Method for Measuring the Minimum Oxygen Concentration to Support Candle-Like Combustion of Plastics (Oxygen Index) * DIN 4102 Part 1 Fire behaviour of building materials and building components ‚Äì Part 1: Building materials; concepts, requirements and tests * UL 94 Standard for Tests for Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances * UL 2221 Tests of Fire Resistive Grease Duct Enclosure Assemblies * UL 1479 Fire Tests of Through- Penetration Firestops * UL 1709 Rapid Rise Fire Tests of Protection Materials for Structural Steel * UL 2085 Protected Aboveground Tanks for Flammable and Combustible Liquids * EN 16034 Pedestrian doorsets, industrial, commercial, garage doors and openable windows ‚Äì Product standard, performance characteristics ‚Äì Fire resisting and/or smoke control characteristics * FAR 25.853 [a-1] & ASTM E 906 Standard Test Method for Heat and Visible Smoke Release Rates for Materials and Products, also known as the OSU Test  Organisations that perform fire testing  * QAI Laboratories * Southwest Research Institute * Groupe CTT Group, Canada * Currenta, Germany * Exova * Applus+ Laboratories * NTA Inc * Intertek * Underwriters Laboratories * FM Global * National Research Council in Canada * iBMB at Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig * EFECTIS (previously CSTB & TNO) * NGC Testing Services {{Cite web|url=https://www.ngctestingservices.com/fire.html|title=NGCTS|website=www.ngctestingservices.com|access- date=2019-09-05 * Thomas Bell-Wright International Consultants  Ad hoc fire testing  A fire test can also mean an ad hoc test performed to gather information in order to understand a specific hazard, such as a construction or storage configuration. Tests can be bench scale (e.g., flammable liquid flash point), medium scale (e.g., storage commodity classification), or full scale (e.g., replication of an entire rack storage configuration).NFPA 13 Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems 2007 Edition, Annex C Explanation of Test Data and Procedures for Rack Storage Typical information gathered from full-scale testing is heat release rate vs. time, smoke production and species composition, radiant heat, and interaction with fire control or suppression systems.  Fire test examples  Many fire tests are run by official laboratories for the purpose of product certification. However, some manufacturers of fire protection products also maintain their own facilities and run tests for R & D purposes before going to the expense and exposure of a test at a third party facility. Some universities have functioning fire research groups which are equipped to run fire tests on building materials. The below photos illustrate types of furnace testing as seen in the United States.

Plot Two weeks following the events of \\"Fallout\\", Peter remains in a coma after consecutively absorbing too many powers. When Simone comes to visit, Nathan asks her to take him to Isaac so that he can learn more about the cause to which Peter has devoted himself. Claire fakes memory loss in the presence of Mr. Bennet, so he doesn't discover the Haitian disobeyed an order. She is distraught that Zach has no memory of their friendship. She expresses to the Haitian how she cannot go on alone and asks for Zach's memory to be restored and for a meeting with Peter. The Haitian informs her that he cannot restore Zach's memory and that Peter is being watched, and if she visits him, Mr. Bennet will know that she has retained her memories. Claire recreates her original encounter with Zach in \\"Genesis\\" by asking him to videotape her as she jumps from a high platform, exhibiting her healing powers in front of him and once again placing her confidence in him. At Primatech Paper, Mr. Bennet is unable to isolate the strands of code that determine the origin of Sylar's abilities without killing him. At Matt Parkman's urging, a SWAT team descends on Primatech Paper in search of Sylar, but they fail to yield results and Audrey is reprimanded by her superior. Matt confronts Mr. Bennet, threatening to continue his investigation. Matt later returns home to find Janice ready to leave, awaiting his decision on the status of their marriage. Matt decides to tell her about his ability. Niki remains confined in a county jail after her surrender to authorities in \\"Fallout\\". Her lawyer informs her that the District Attorney is going to seek the death penalty for her crimes; he suggests that she cooperate by revealing the location of the stolen money, but she claims to know nothing about it. Jessica then intermittently takes control of the conversation, making the lawyer question her mental stability. D.L. Hawkins, once again living at home, is visited by a representative of Mr. Linderman. He is informed that due to Niki's confession, the charges against him are dropped, but his debt to Mr. Linderman remains undecided. He and Micah later visit Niki in prison, where she tells him of her upcoming evaluation at the psychiatric ward and asserts that Jessica is not merely a dual personality. She then pleads with the guard to let her hug Micah; he refuses and eventually takes out his baton. Niki counters by snatching it and snapping it cleanly in half, displaying her super strength. Security personnel then overtake her. Hiro and Ando finally make it to New York City, determining that they must find the sword used by \\"Future Hiro\\" in order to fully restore Hiro's abilities. The two locate the sword at the Museum of Natural History, and Hiro slows down time enough to steal it. However, he then discovers it to be a replica provided by Mr. Linderman (as seen in the image above). The two later catch up with Isaac, Simone, and Nathan. Simone is convinced Isaac and Hiro both have powers. Mohinder Suresh, at his apartment in New York, is visited by an FBI agent who states that they are finally taking his warnings seriously after all of Sylar's murders. He then reveals to Mohinder that Eden McCain, whose real name was Sarah Ellis, was found dead at Lake Ramsey in Sudbury, Ontario with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Mohinder is later visited by Mr. Bennet who tells him of Eden's abilities and her employment with him. He then asks for Mohinder's help, revealing that he needs Chandra Suresh's research. Mohinder refuses, but Mr. Bennet gives him a Primatech business card to contact him if he changes his mind. Ted Sprague is seen practicing using his hands to generate small explosions. Peter experiences another prophetic vision of himself exploding in New York City, this time featuring fleeting visions of an unnamed bearded man. Peter wakes up screaming and leaves the hospital. He books a flight to the desert where nuclear tests were once conducted, and then sees the bearded man from his vision nonchalantly stealing from people he passes on the street. When Peter pursues him, the man is stunned that Peter can see him despite his power of invisibility. Because Peter is around him, Peter absorbs his ability and becomes invisible as well. The bearded man attacks Peter. At the very end of the episode, Niki is revealed to have been confined in a padded room in a psychiatric ward, bound in a straitjacket. Miserably, she asks God for help. As the lights switch off, Jessica says, \\"Who needs God when you've got me?\\" Narration ;At the end: In the beginning, there was discovery, a confusion of elements, a first snowfall of impossible change. Old lives undone, left behind, strange faces made familiar, new nightmares to challenge sleep, new friends to feel safe with. Only then comes control, the need to impose order onto chaos through determination, through study, through struggle, all in defiance of a thundering truth. They're here, and the earth shudders underfoot. There is no narration at the beginning of the episode. Ratings The total viewership for this episode was 14.90 million.

It spent five weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 29. The group's line-up for this album remained unchanged from the previous Church of Hawkwind album, although for this recording the group started to heavily use drum machines and drum loops, with most of Griffin's contributions being relegated to disjointed drum fills. Griffin was unhappy with this role, and group-leader Dave Brock was dissatisfied with Griffin's timekeeping, so they mutually agreed to part company, although Griffin reluctantly agreed to fulfil the scheduled tour commitments. The album was recorded in June and July 1982 at Rockfield Studios. Science fiction author Michael Moorcock contributed lyrics to the album, but credited his wife Lynda Steele in order to bypass his music publisher Douglas Smith with whom he was in dispute. The lyrics to \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", which had been written by former lead singer Robert Calvert and originally recorded but unused in 1978, were based on Ray Bradbury's book Fahrenheit 451. The album makes use of samples, featuring Ian Holm from a 1981 BBC Radio 4 serialisation of The Lord of the Rings on \\"Dream Worker\\", and the spoken introduction of The Outer Limits on \\"Void City\\". \\"Silver Machine\\" and \\"Psychedelic Warlords\\" are re-recordings of the early 1970s singles which were not originally intended for inclusion on the album. The group undertook a 29-date UK tour in November and December to promote the album, with support from the Spanish rock group Bar√≥n Rojo. Saxophonist and singer Nik Turner rejoined the group for this tour. Recordings from this tour have been issued on the albums Zones (1983), Out & Intake (1987) and Choose Your Masques: Collectors Series Volume 2 (1999).

The Mexican vihuela is a guitar-like string instrument from 19th-century Mexico with five strings and typically played in mariachi groups. Mexican vihuela Although the Mexican vihuela has the same name as the historic Spanish plucked string instrument, the two are distinct. The Mexican vihuela has more in common with the Timple Canario (see: timple) due to both having five strings and both having vaulted (convex) backs. The Mexican vihuela is tuned similarly to the guitar. The difference is that the open G, the D and the A strings are tuned an octave higher than a guitar thus giving it a tenor sound or a higher pitch. The gauge of the strings and the order in which they are applied is important in producing a soft sound or a punchy bold sound when the instrument is strummed (the strum is called a m√°nico, and also references rhythmic patterns). The implementation of the vihuela to a mariachi is to give a duet of sorts with the Spanish guitar, one having a low tuning while the vihuela has the higher tuning to complement each other. The optimal spot to strum this instrument is between the sound hole and the point where the fret board or neck meets the body of the instrument. This area is where a pick guard can be installed (the same linear area between the upper and lower bouts closest to the fingerboard.) The Mexican vihuela is a small, deep-bodied rhythm guitar built along the same lines as the guitarr√≥n. The Mexican Vihuela is used by Mariachi groups. This instrument is strummed with all of the fingernail tips to produce a rich, full and clear sound of the chords being played. A finger pick (la p√∫a) on the pointer finger and or the second and third fingers, gives it a brighter and clearer sound when strummed. Many vihuela players have longer than normal fingernails on their strumming hand to facilitate their playing technique and to also get a clear crystal sound. Notes and tuning Vihuela Mexicana tuning. The vihuela has five nylon strings in reentrant tuning. Similar to the first five strings of a guitar, but with the third, fourth and fifth an octave above what one might expect. Tuning: A-D-G-B-E ‚Äì The A, D, and G are tuned one octave above a guitar. Sources * Blattman, Erica et al.

Plot Niki is still in the county jail. A psychiatrist arrives to work on Niki's case, and diagnoses her with multiple personality disorder; Niki refuses her help. Meanwhile, D.L. is having difficulty getting money to pay the rent, and being a single dad for Micah. He sneaks into Niki's cell to break her out, but she insists on remaining and tells him that he must step up and take care of Micah. After school, Micah stops by an automated teller machine and uses his power to withdraw thousands of dollars. D.L. and Micah make up, and Micah gives him the money to pay for rent. The psychologist returns to help Niki, but in order for her to help Niki, Niki must let her talk with Jessica. Matt tells his wife more about the events at Primatech Paper. She has difficulty accepting his powers and the events of the past month. She also begs him again to fix the plumbing. He attends his review, where his statement of the actual events at Primatech are not believed by the three captains. Hearing their thoughts and realizing the consequences of maintaining his story, Matt recants and said he lied because he failed his detective test three times and wanted to look like a hero. The review board places him on six months suspension. He returns home to leaking plumbing. After fixing the plumbing, he tells his wife about the suspension, and fears that his already tumultuous marriage is ruined. His wife lets him read her mind once more. Matt does and learns she is pregnant. They rejoice. Claire and Zach begin researching her biological mother. In a secret meeting with The Haitian (signaled by Claire putting up wind chimes outside her window as instructed), he reveals to Claire that Mr. Bennet told him her mother died 14 years ago, but tells Claire that it will be the last time she will be able to talk to him about her family history. Mr. Bennet and Sandra Bennet become concerned with Claire's behavior and how much homework she has, as Claire and Zach cover up their investigation by claiming to be working on a paper about manatees. At one point, they are almost caught looking at Mr. Bennet's computer files in their search for the truth, but close everything before he enters the house. Enlargement of part of the news article Zach and Claire find. Searching for other avenues for the truth, Claire and Zach find a news article which states both she and her mother died in a fire in Kermit, Texas. They understand that it may not have been all that unreasonable for Claire to have been considered dead but \\"heal\\" through regeneration; what they don't immediately realize is that her mother may also be very much alive through a similar means. Zach pushes her to keep researching as she may find a distant relative. After a heart-to-heart with Mr. Bennet (who also sees the chimes outside Claire's window) about growing up, Claire's persistence pays off, as a phone call to a possible relative puts her in contact with a woman who knows of Meredith Gordon, her biological mother. The woman asks why she is asking this. Claire tells her that she may be her daughter. The woman, shocked, replies that she is Meredith Gordon while lighting a cigarette with her fingers. Hiro's powers have still not returned as he and Ando prepare to leave the museum's parking garage. However, strangers are waiting for them, and they are kidnapped. Their captor claims to know all about Hiro and his hero status. He offers them plane tickets to Japan from his boss, but Hiro refuses to abandon his mission. Their captor takes them to an alley, where they meet his boss‚ÄîHiro's father, played by George Takei. (Takei played the role of helmsman Hikaru Sulu on the USS Enterprise in the original Star Trek series. The registry number of that spaceship, NCC-1701, appears on the license plate of Nakamura's limousine.) Nathan goes to Mohinder to find out where Peter is, but neither have heard from Peter in days. Mohinder tells Nathan about Chandra's list. He explains to Nathan how Peter's DNA causes him to soak up others' abilities. Nathan initially refuses to let Mohinder help find Peter, but Mohinder convinces him by stating that if he can study Peter, he may be able to find a cure for all the affected people. Peter finds Claude, who is shocked that Peter can see him. Peter asks for his help in learning how to control his powers. Claude refuses to help and warns that others have tried and failed. Peter finds him again on the roof of Charles' building, and again asks for help. Claude again refuses. When Nathan and Mohinder arrive at Peter's apartment, Mohinder says that he wants to study and cure Peter, but Peter is insulted, so he runs away from the apartment. Peter tricks the men and gets away with Claude's help. Claude finally agrees to help Peter train his empathic powers. Claude's name is an explicit reference to Claude Rains, who played the Invisible Man in the 1933 film of the same name. Mr. Bennet goes to check on Sylar.

Biography She was born in Rensselaerville, New York. She moved to Illinois in 1835, and there married Thomas J. Farnham in 1836, but returned to New York in 1841. In 1844, through the influence of Horace Greeley and other reformers, she was appointed matron of the women's ward at Sing Sing Prison. She strongly believed in the use of phrenology to treat prisoners. Farnham was influential in changing the types of reading materials available to women prisoners. The purpose of her choices was not entertainment but improving behavior. Amid controversy over her choices and beliefs, Farnham resigned in 1848.Vogel, Brenda. (2009) The Prison Library Primer. Lanham: The Scarecrow Press, Inc. She also advocated using music and kindness in the rehabilitation of female prisoners. She retained the office of matron until 1848, when she moved to Boston, and was for several months connected with the management of the Institution for the Blind. In 1849 she visited California, and remained there until 1856, when she returned to New York. For the two years following, she devoted herself to the study of medicine, and in 1859 organized a society to assist destitute women in finding homes in the west, taking charge in person of several companies of this class of emigrants. She subsequently returned to California. She died from consumption in New York City at the age of 49. She was an atheist.Knepper, Paul. Writing the History of Crime.

According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), no agreed- upon definition of maximum output exists. UNCTAD itself proposes: \\"the productive resources, entrepreneurial capabilities and production linkages which together determine the capacity of a country to produce goods and services.\\" The term may also be applied to individual resources or assets; for instance the productive capacity of an area of farmland.  Definition in more depth  Productive capacity has a lot in common with a production possibility frontier (PPF) that is an answer to the question what the maximum production capacity of a certain economy is that means using as many economy‚Äôs resources to make the output as possible. In a standard PPF graph, two types of goods‚Äô quantities are set. PPF expresses all the possibilities of combination of these goods that can be maximally produced by a certain economy due to its scarce resources and creates a downward-sloping line. When a certain body reaches any point under the line, the body‚Äôs production is under productive potential. When the body‚Äôs combination of the two goods included in the graph reaches a point which stands on the PPF line, the body is at its maximum productivity, which creates the highest efficiency on the body. Any other situation cannot be reached because the line gives a limit to the goods‚Äô production that is not possible to be exceeded. In the case of a productive capacity graph, on the horizontal line are defined capital goods and on the vertical line, consumer goods are stated. The functioning of the productive capacity graph is the same as for the above-mentioned PPF graph. The only possible outputs are those that lie under and on the PPF line. If an economy suffers from an under-production, thus an output point can be located under the productive potential, the economy loses its maximum potential output and spare capacity is created. That equals to the fact that the economy has a lower GDP than is possible. An economy employing all the economically active people and all the resources efficiently produces on its PPF line, therefore has the biggest GDP as possible.  Strengthening productive capacity  Owing to the aim of the world to heighten well-being in general, productive capacity needs to be heightened as well. In our imperfect world, there are always workers that are not employed and resources that are not used efficiently ‚Äì due to that, states are able to succeed in raising it. The process of heightening productive capacity can be related to many reasons, such as: # Quantity of labour ‚Äì The most crucial factor is how wide and how qualified is the range of an economy‚Äôs labour. With more economically active people, low unemployment and a high level of human capital, the economy is more able to move its PPF to the right. # Labour‚Äôs productivity ‚Äì Closely related to education, motivation, the efficiency of work etc. People who achieve internal motivation accomplish work-related activities more than people who are bored with their work. With more effective labour, a nation has bigger potential to do their best, thus has higher output because of a positive impact on labour productivity that increases its efficiency, hence the growth of the GDP. # Size of capital ‚Äì The number of financial resources. It includes financial assets, enterprises, machines, patents or technologies that can be used by labour in a production process. It is always good to distinguish between spending or investing that because investing capital is often related to heightening the capital. Due to this fact, enterprises, states or even the whole society could be better off. # Entrepreneur potential ‚Äì Immeasurable potential of people in a certain state to innovate, take risks or establish new enterprises. With more entrepreneurs, there will be a more significant competition that can lead to equilibrium. Without entrepreneurs, states do not have much potential to move their productive capacity to the right. # Political stability ‚Äì In states that are affected by armed conflict, struggle for power, mafia etc., the investment inflow is not as high as it could be without all the above-mentioned issues. Enterprises that want to extend their production to other countries often choose the states that have high political stability because they do not want to risk. The fact that direct investment from a foreign nation predominantly brings many advantages for a state that is invested in is widely known. Some of these advantages could be technology innovations, jobs creation, improving relationships between the states included in the process and many others.  Productive capacity of the world‚Äôs Least Developed Countries (LDC)  All of the above-mentioned statements that could be applied to raise productive capacity apply to LDC as well. Investment in human or financial capital, providing better education, innovations or raising entrepreneurs ‚Äì all of these have to be implemented especially in these countries. Although, because of its specific starting position, there are several additional recommendations to succeed in productive capacity heightening process: # Enhancing the environment of a country ‚Äì Quality of infrastructure, transport or telecommunication services must be improved to entice investors from foreign countries. Without investing in the environment, states‚Äô chances to manage an inflow of investors approach to zero. # Improvement of power supply ‚Äì Today, most of the places is dependent on electricity. Without a proper power supply, no investors will come due to electricity required to realise the investments and many other reasons. # Building social infrastructure ‚Äì Social infrastructure consists of buildings that provide people education, health, banking etc. All of these are as crucial as the above-mentioned ones ‚Äì LDC that want to be successful in enhancing their country must improve all of the statements together because they are closely related to inflowing foreign investors.

Based at the University of Tasmania‚Äôs Hobart campus, the clearinghouse acted as both a publishing house on youth studies and as an information service for youth workers and youth researchers, as well as others interested in the study of young people in Australia. As a clearinghouse, ACYS synthesised a range of resources, by, for example, digesting the contents of newspaper articles for its \\"youth monitor\\" column in its journal, Youth Studies Australia, and by publishing abstracts of key articles in scholarly journals, bringing this information to the attention of the youth studies field. Its journal, Youth Studies Australia, was a platform for researchers and youth workers to publish peer-reviewed research papers and thereby provide material for anyone interested in youth research -- policymakers, practitioners and youth work/youth studies students. ACYS also supplied information about youth research, policy and practice in the form of news articles, book reviews, and other products for its multi-disciplinary audience. ACYS resources included: * Youth Studies Australia, a peer-reviewed journal that was highly regarded as a source of knowledge on issues affecting Australian and New Zealand young people. * Youth Field Xpress, a free email newsletter about youth research and youth work issues that contained a wide and eclectic range of news stories drawn from both online and print sources. * the ACYS website, which was a compendium of helpful information sources on youth issues * books and other publications on youth issues. From time to time ACYS organised symposia on youth issues. History of ACYS: With its origins in the early 1980s as the National Clearinghouse for Youth Studies Bulletin based at the Australian National University, the clearinghouse moved to the University of Tasmania after a national bidding process in 1984. Following this move, the National Clearinghouse for Youth Studies Bulletin and Abstracts was distributed on a subscription basis. In 1989 after a change of staff, the bulletin was redesigned and re-launched as a journal, Youth Studies. A year later the journal's title was amended to Youth Studies Australia. In 1998, the National Clearinghouse for Youth Studies became the Australian Clearinghouse for Youth Studies or ACYS. (Source: Flyer about the clearinghouse published in 1995.) In the 2014 Australian federal budget, the organisation lost its funding in 2014 and finally closed its doors in 2015.

It is serialized by Kodansha in Monthly Afternoon.  Story  The story begins with Hermias, one of Aristotle's disciples, being tortured and interrogated in Assus, a town on the western edge of the Persian Empire. He is confronted by a Persian commander, Memnon, who questions him if his teacher is really worth dying for. The story then skips ahead a few days to the ruins of Troy, where Aristotle, one of his disciples, and a slave find Eumenes in a boat attempting to make oars. They spend the night there, talking about various subjects such as philosophy and slavery and leave the next morning. Eumenes is then visited by a Persian named Barsine, who questions him about his visitors the previous night. He claims that he hasn't seen the people she's asking him about and she goes back to her escort of horsemen and leaves. Soon after, Aristotle and his student come running towards Eumenes chased by the horsemen who visited shortly before this and they immediately take off, narrowly escaping capture. Barsine is then met by Memnon and states \\"the next person to come over this channel probably isn't going to be a philosopher.\\" Eumenes and his company are met by a horse-drawn cart on the other side that was waiting for Aristotle. Eumenes find that they are both heading towards Cardia, but the people in the cart refuse to take Eumenes there, stating that a slave can walk. When Eumenes reaches Cardia, he finds the town surrounded by a Macedonian army, consisting of two columns of phalangites circling the city. He notices the commander of the army right away, and ponders about the peculiarity of the situation, and then proceeds to greet an old lady waiting outside of the town. Eumenes develops a plan to carry the old lady across the column of phalangites on his shoulders, claiming that this would show the old lady's status. Afterward they find that town guards won't open the gate to let them in the city. Another group of people consisting of a man named Antigonus and two other men come running through the columns. Eumenes eventually develops a plan to repeatedly shout out that, \\"his master's remains had to be returned into the city\\" in front of the Macedonian army. His plan works and the group is allowed in the city shortly afterward. Inside the city, Antigonus asks Eumenes to meet him in three days. He then goes to the ruins of his old house and the story goes into a flashback, showing his childhood, how he left Cardia, his early adventures, and his first war in Paphlagonia. The story then backs up to when Eumenes was a boy in an aristocratic family in Cardia. Eumenes is tremendously talented and intelligent, hoped by his father to be a powerful asset to the family and his far less able older brother. Eumenes is beset by a recurring dream of a woman slaughtering many Greek soldiers with a sword in beautiful combat before being cutdown and brutally raped. All of his time was spent if not studying in his father's library, he ventures out with his friends and attending philosopher's lessons. All is simple, until he met Thrax, a Scythian slave. Thrax later broke free by killing his master, flaying him. And he tried to escape, but failed. He killed several Cardian militia and civilians, save Eumenes until regular soldiers arrives and mortally wounds him. He never hurt Eumenes, for unknown reasons. Eumenes arrived on his house, but found his adopted father dead and Thrax's body beside him. His father's friend used the opportunity to eliminate Eumenes by betraying him to the city council, citing his true heritage as a Scythian. The council decided to sell Eumenes as a slave, letting him stay on his former house until a buyer arrives. His condition got worse from master to being a slave, frowned upon by his former servants (one of the servants, his former servant was the one who used Eumenes to stop the woman's rampages). And as a buyer arrives, he was sold for a talent and sent to a Greek-dominated, Scythian border city. But a mutiny came aboard the ship where he rode, killing his buyer and he joined the slaves, but no longer, when a storm broke and the ship sunk. Eumenes was later saved by the village people who lived on a lake near a Greek-dominated town, while killing the rest of the slaves. He lived with them, teaching them Greek customs and religions, in exchange of food and lodgings. All seems well, until some villagers were killed when the Tios' militia, under the leader's eldest son tries to usurp the villager's lands. They spied upon the town's activity. When his suspicion was confirmed, he concocts an idea where he acts as a wounded Greek citizen by letting him deliberately slashed by his friend and deliberately blows the weak point of the village to the enemy, unknown to them, a trap was set. The leader of the raid was killed and the village was set free. The leader apologized to the villagers for his son's foolishness and gave them freedom. But the condition was set and Eumenes forced to feign hostility to the villagers, hurting the lass who fell in love with him and left the village to go to Cardia. When he met Aristotle and his assistant, being chased by Persians. He returned to Cardia and met an old woman and Antigonus. He used Antigonus's vase and the old woman to trick Cardia's guards to open the gate. Then he continued to his former house, where he met his friend, now Cardia's guard (where he knew that his former fianc√©e was married to a wheelmaker's son) and met his step-brother, who apologized to him for being a coward. He also knew that Eumenes was set up by his father's friend. And let him see his mother's grave, revealing that until death, she tried to apologize to her estranged stepson. He later met his father's friend's slave and tried to kill him, but he killed him in self-defense. He met the friend of his father, and met Antigonus alongside him. Antigonus orders his assistant to kill (faking fighting) to let him escape and meet him in the city gates. It was later revealed Antigonus (a pseudonym) is Philip of Macedon when the Macedonian general bowed to him. And Cardia was captured after 3 days. He was sent to the Imperial Palace to act as his Royal Secretary. Despite his Scythian background, he was trained by the Macedonians. He also met young Alexander the Great, young Arrhidaeus, and other Macedonian and Greek characters. It was later revealed that Arrhidaeus was mentally and intellectually delayed, and Alexander has split personality, one's a timid one and another a mature, but cold one named Hephaestion, and her mother Olympias has other lovers and murdered a man rumored to be Alexander's real father in cold blood. Philip tried to send him to the school in Mieza where Aristotle is, but he refused, preferring to stay in Pella. While in Pella, he created things that were useful to others, like chess and plays it with the King alongside Parmenion and Antipater, the latter invited Eumenes, but declined just to do somethings, to come to his place. His first taste of warfare was when he assisted Philip on besieging both Byzantium and Perinthus, which failed when Athens attacked their fleet and lifting their siege. Then they battles Scythians after the Scythian King Ateas reneged on their deal. They defeated the Scythians. Then they were ambushed by Triballians , wounding Philip and scattering their slaves. Quick thinking of Eumenes was used to prevent more losses and secure the victory. After the Macedonians returned, he was sent by Antipater to Athens to \\"assassinate\\" Phocion. They disguised themselves as foreign. They were rebuffed, until the old man let Eumenes in. But their cover was blown, but no incident happened. But mobs tried to capture them, and the group dispersed. Eumenes decided to meet Phocion's friend Melanthios in Piraeus, revealed to be Eumenes's family's former slave, Charon. He fled to Pella, but midway, he met Philip busy against Athenians and Thebans. They battled on Mount Thurion. The campaign was victorious, with Alexander easily passing through the Theban and Athenian lines, casually killing then taking weapons from his enemies, then fell back. Eumedes got a bit of promotion, but at the cost of his girlfriend Eurydice , who was engaged to Philip. He also wanted to quit, but he uncovered an assassination plot. Pausanias, who was put into the royal guard, to guard Olympias after she was exiled to Molossia after an attempt at Eurydice, was tasked to eliminate her. But Pausanias was able to eliminate the assassins and swore his loyalty to Olympias. During the wedding of Philip and Eurydice, an incident between Attalus and Alexander happened when the former greeted the couple, which enraged Alexander. Philip took the side of Attalus. But it was settled off-screen. And for the first time, Philip married a Macedonian. Alexander was exiled to the west, but unlike his mother, who stayed on her brother, the King of Epirus, Alexander and Philip attained reconciliation, but not after leaving Illyria. Then also at a flashback, Philip was hit by a snake by Olympias. Eumenes was called by Philip with Aristotle in the room. He plans to insert the duo in Parmenion and Attalus's forces, then tasked Eumenes to take care of Eurydice for him, as she gave birth to her twin children. Eumenes asked if Alexander still be the heir, Philip affirmed. Then he reluctantly accepted the task. Eumenes and Aristotle talks about the spheric earth mode he gave to Philip. Then, Aristotle left for an inn when he met an seemingly un-aged man who knew him before the man left. Philip then appears at Aegea, to celebrate the marriage between the King of Epirus and one of the Royal daughters, there he was assassinated by Pausanias.  Main characters  Historie portrays many historical characters who actually existed in ancient Greece and Persia. Eumenes, as portrayed in Historie ; Eumenes :An intelligent young boy from Cardia who has been troubled with a bad dream of a woman killing soldiers since childhood. Much of his past is revealed during the series: he is, in truth, a Scythian, but is adopted by Hieronymus when his own family was massacred in a Greek slave raid. After a relatively happy childhood in Cardia, the events following Scythian slave Thrax's escape resulted in Hieronymus' death and the revelation of Eumenes' Scythian heritage, making him a slave. He was sold and shipped off Cardia, but soon after the slaves on the ship he is in mutinied before being sunk in a storm. Shipwrecked, Eumenes found himself on the shores of Paphlagonia, near the village of Boa, where he spent the rest of his childhood teaching its villagers in the ways of the Greeks, while becoming accepted as one of their own in the meantime. This quiet life was interrupted when a mercenary army from the nearby Greek city of Tios attacked the village. He repelled the attack and killed the leader. He left the village later then went to Cardia, which was under siege by Philip II. He later became Philip's apprentice when he learnt that the former is learning tactics. ; Charon :A slave in the Hieronymus household and Eumenes' personal attendant (\\"pedagogue\\" in the original sense of the word). He gives Eumenes an amulet that belongs to Eumenes' mother before the latter leaves Cardia. It is revealed in a flashback that he is, despite his denial to Eumenes, actually present in the incident of Eumenes' mother's death, and is in fact responsible for her downfall by holding young Eumenes hostage. He went to Piraeus, making his fortune as a famous man. ; Hieronymus (the Elder) :At first appears to be Eumenes' father. However, it is later revealed that he actually adopts him after killing all of Eumenes' native family during a slave raid he led. (However, Hironymus himself did not commit this affair, but his subordinates.) Considered to be killed by Thrax during the latter's attempted escape, though another person actually appears to be responsible for the crime. ;Hieronymus (the Younger) :Hieronymus's son who is jealous of Eumenes in his childhood due to the Eumenes' superior intelligence and skills and his father's apparent favoritism. However, when Eumenes is sold as a slave, it is revealed that most of the information known about Eumenes' life came from Hieronymus, implying that Hieronymus truly cares about Eumenes, deep down. ; Tolmides :A childhood friend of Eumenes. Is seen serving in Cardia's militia when Eumenes returns to the city. ; Satura :Villager of Boa and initially hostile yet curious of Eumenes. As he begins to adapt to life in Boa they grew more and more attached even though it is revealed that she is already betrothed to the next head of the city Tios. After the engagement is broken off due to war she becomes Eumenes lover. However in order to save the village from being destroyed, Eumenes (when found out by the next heir of Tios that he was responsible for the battle) pretends that he was having a personal agenda and didn't care about the villagers at all making him an enemy and also giving up Satura to be Telemakos bride to save the lives of the town. She follows along, yet is heartbroken. ; Perialla :A childhood friend of Eumenes who appears to be attracted to him at first. When Eumenes becomes a slave, she treats him with hostility. Later marries a wheelmaker's son. ; Thrax :A Scythian slave. Appears to have recognized Eumenes as a fellow Scythian. During the series, he breaks free and attempts to escape Cardia, killing many of the city's militia and citizens in the process. During a fight in the marketplace, he comes in close contact with Eumenes but does not kill the latter, leading the citizens of Cardia to suspect Eumenes. He is eventually mortally wounded, though apparently died only after attempting to follow Eumenes somewhere. And was used as an excuse by naming him suspect in killing Hieronymus the Elder ; Theogeiton :A loan shark who owns the slave Thrax; known for his brutal treatment of his slaves. When Thrax is released from the shackles that binds his arms and leg, he and his entire family are killed. ; Memnon :A commander of the Greek mercenaries working for the Persians chasing after Aristotle. First seen in Assus, then a part of the Persian Empire while interrogating Hermias, Aristotle's father-in-law, in an attempt to track down the philosopher. ; Hermias :Aristotle's father-in law; a Eunuch. First seen chained up in Assus. Even under intense interrogation, he refuses to say anything about the teacher Aristotle. ; Aristotle :A world-renowned philosopher. At the start of the series, he is being chased by the Persian Empire on suspicion of spying. Along with one of his students, Callisthenes, and the slave Victas, he first meets Eumenes near the ruins of Troy while in need of a boat to cross the Dardanelles. Because Eumenes has not yet finished building his improvised oar, he spend the night camping and conversing with the latter over various subjects, and becomes impressed by the latter's intelligence. The day after that, he, Callisthenes, and Eumenes escapes the Persians in the nick of time, landing in Europe, all headed to Cardia (though Eumenes is left behind). ; Barsine :The wife of the governor of Troius. Is shown to be very intelligent. ; Philip II of Macedon :The king of Macedonia. Introduced in the story claiming to be Antigonus, a merchant from Perinthus, coming to Cardia to look for Hieronymus (the Younger). First meets Eumenes outside the gates of Cardia. Impressed by the latter's performance in gaining entrance to the city, he impetuously asks Eumenes to come and work for him. ; Arrhidaeus :Son of Philip II, shown as an intellectually disabled child. Eumenes gave him a toy chariot, replaced when Alexander the Great accidentally destroyed it. ; Alexander the Great :Son of Philip II of Macedon and Arrhidaeus half-brother. Shown to be a respectful child. Has a split personality named Hephaeston. Shown with a snake-shaped scar, but Hephaeston has none and loathed snakes. He was shown having a calm attitude and an instinctual leader. ; Olympias :Alexander the Great's mother. She has a secret agenda for her son.

Serving with the British Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force in the First World War, LeBoutillier scored 10 aerial victories, witnessed the death of Manfred von Richthofen and was a vigorous proponent of Captain Roy Brown as the victor over Richthofen.(Fresno Bee, 13 July 1973) Retrieved on 9 April 2010.(Las Vegas News Journal\\", 25 October 1970) Retrieved on 9 April 2010. Post war, he became a stunt pilot for movies, a skywriter, and an aviation instructor whose most famous student was Amelia Earhart. Later, he became a civil aviation inspector. Early life HeLeBoutillierwas born on 24 May 1894 to an English father and Canadian mother in Montclair, New Jersey. First World War LeBoutillier trained at the Wright Brothers Flying School in Mineola, New York. He then crossed into Canada and joined the Royal Naval Air Service on 21 August 1916. By April 1917, he had joined the No. 9 Squadron Royal Naval Air Service as a sub-lieutenant to pilot a Sopwith Triplane. Between 25 May and 29 July 1917, he scored four victories by driving enemy planes down out of control. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps were combined into the Royal Air Force and 9 Naval became No. 209 Squadron RAF. During a squadron dogfight on 21 April 1918 in the Somme River valley, LeBoutillier, Robert Foster, and Merrill Samuel Taylor shot down an Albatros two-seater and sparked a running dogfight during which Captain Roy Brown claimed to have downed Manfred von Richthofen. LeBoutillier claimed to have witnessed Brown's tracer bullets penetrating Richthofen's cockpit. Immediately after its crash, LeBoutillier flew over the triplane of von Richthofen. LeBoutillier finished the war with 10 aerial victories; one shared aircraft captured, three destroyed (including two shared), and six 'out of control' (one of which was shared). He had over 600 hours flying time in his log book by the end of the war. Post-war Upon his return to the United States, LeBoutillier became a skywriter, and later an official of the Skywriting Corporation of America. He also became a barnstormer and piloted aircraft for eighteen movies, including: Hell's Angels and Wings. As a flight instructor, he gave Amelia Earhart her first lesson in a twin-engined aircraft. He became a Civil Aviation Authority inspector in charge of Colorado and Wyoming. LeBoutillier died on 12 May 1983 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Originally designed to be used by the second crew member/observer of military airplanes, it was later issued to ground troops. Between May and November 1916 a section was assigned to each infantry battalion of the Italian army and from May 1917 the number of sections was increased to 3 per battalion. As it was designed to use 9mm pistol ammunition, it is said to be the first true submachine gun. Design The Villar Perosa was designed as a portable double-barrel machine gun firing a 9mm round. It consisted of two independent coupled weapons, each with its own barrel, firing mechanism, and separate 25-round magazine. As it was originally designed to be operated from airplanes, it had a high rate of fire of over 1,500 rounds per minute. However, in practice the 9mm munition was not sufficiently powerful to shoot down aircraft, which had become ever more resistant over the course of the war, and in addition the range was inadequate. It was also used during World War I by the Italian infantry, with a bipod and a gun shield. Despite its high rate of fire, its atypical design, and its weight, it proved to be very effective at short range. Legacy In 1918, Austria-Hungary created a copy of the VP, the Sturmpistole M.18, which featured a straight magazine rather than curved magazines.Landships II, http://www.landships.info/landships/weapon_articles.html?load=weapon_articles/Villar_Perosa.html The mechanism of the VP was a sound design, and shortly after the end of the war was used as the basis of a more practical weapon, the OVP submachine gun.

It is related to vernacular photography, but differs in the fact that the \\"presenter\\" or exhibitor of the photographs did not \\"shoot\\" the photograph itself, does not know anything about the photographer, and generally does not know anything about the subject(s) of the photographs. Found photos are generally acquired at flea markets, thrift and other secondhand stores, yard sales, estate and tag sales, in dumpsters and trash cans, between the pages of books, or literally just \\"found\\" anywhere. Looking at found photography Much of the appeal of found photography is the mystery regarding the original photographer or subject matter. Barry MauerMauer, Barry. ‚ÄúThe Found Photograph and the Limits of Meaning.‚Äù Enculturation, Fall 2001. http://enculturation.gmu.edu/3_2/mauer/index.html. lists four practices of looking that influence inferences made in regards to the origin of found photos; voyeurism, Sherlock Holmes' style deductive reasoning, Surrealism, and with the eyes of a cultural anthropologist. He describes the ideal found photography exhibit as inviting a viewer to sample all of these viewing practices in order to achieve two results: to force a viewer to consider the effect of their own perceptual process during their viewing and to build the widest spectrum of possible meaning within the limitations of found photography. History of found photography The history of found photography is not well documented because it most likely started as someone's hobby before being introduced to the art world, but even its first ventures into fine art are uncertain because the art community has not received found photography well, much like its predecessor found object art. Found photography actually falls underneath the umbrella of found object art, which has its origins with Marcel Duchamp and his contemporaries in the 1910s. Since found photography utilizes found objects to generate artwork it is considered found object art. However, the found object art movement was about the decontextualization of art, where the form or shape of the artwork creates the meaning rather than the context. As such found photography treads a gray- line between found object art and collage because of its relationship between form and context. Found photography lacks the three-dimensional quality characteristic of found object art but retains form as meaning since it is still a found object. Found photos also have meaning established by context that is a byproduct of being a photograph with an original narrative. However, the viewer is required to actively engage in viewing the photography, much the way they would found object art, in order to unearth this context as meaning that will forever be limited by its unknown origins. Thus there is great debate over whether found photography can be considered found object art or if it is really a method of collage. Researching found photography Anonymous photographs and albums can be important sources for historical research. Crowd sourcing information is one of the methods that can be used for the determination of topographical sites, identification of represented persons and even the photographer. An illustrative example is the research connected with an album containing 399 albumen and salt prints from around 1860, resulting in the conclusion that the photographer was a so far unknown military doctor named Petrus Jan van der Grijp (1819-1897). Using this method a new pioneer of Dutch photography has been discovered. Bool, Flip https://foundphotography.nl/ Found photography as art As a relatively recent movement, there has been little debate over the artistic value of found photography. Categorizing found photography as found object art or collage broadens both the range of available arguments, and also the controversy. Whether or not found photography can be classified as art depends on the viewer's definition of art. In HegelianFowkes, William. ‚ÄúA Hegelian Critique of Found Art and Conceptual Art.‚Äù The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 37, no. 2 (December 1, 1978): 157‚Äì168. terms found photography is not art because the artist who found the photo did not embed meaning or spirit into it. According to Dona Meilach,Meilach, Dona Z. Collage and Found Art. New York: Reinhold Pub. Corp, 1964. a found object artist in the 1960s, found object art, and in correlation found photography, is indeed art because of the artist's manipulation of the found materials. In the case of found photography, the way photos are exhibited by the artist affects the meaning viewers extract from them (refer back to Barry Mauer and Looking at Found Photography). Some found photography artists include: Arianna Arcara and Luca Santese; two Italian photographers, founders of the collective * Cesura (photographers group) , that documented the U.S. economic crisis in Detroit using photos they found all over the city, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Joachim Schmid, Ted Adams; a Philadelphia photographer. Found photography as a hobby People are more likely to engage in found photography as a hobbyist or viewer looking at a hobbyist's collection. Unfortunately, these physical collections remain unknown while they require prior knowledge of its existence and geographical presence from viewers. However, with the creation of new online platforms for displaying photography there are now many online collections available for viewing. In fact the majority of these collections are based on viewer participation, where anyone with a found photograph can upload it for exhibition in the digital gallery. An example would be The Museum of Found Photographs, an open to the public Flickr page that pools members' found photos. Filmmakers Lorca Shepperd and Cabot Philbrick‚Äú‚ÄòOther People‚Äôs Pictures‚Äô : NPR.‚Äù NPR.org, n.d. https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1964382. present an important point about found photography hobbyists in their documentary Other People's Pictures. They interviewed collectors around Chelsea Flea Market in New York City and concluded that found photography hobbyists usually collect pictures for two reasons: they like eccentric images of people doing odd things or wearing funny clothing, or they have personal reasons behind their choices so the photo collection becomes a validation of their history. In the both cases the hobbyist's reason becomes a unifying theme throughout his or her collection and this theme in turn becomes a way of looking at found photography. In this way it can be argued that found photography is art in the hands of professionals and amateurs alike. In Argentina there is a facebook group dedicated to the collection of photographs found on the street called \\"Negativos Encontrados\\" with more than 23,000 members.https://www.facebook.com/groups/416699688383669/?ref=ts&fref;=ts You may see a documentary based on \\"Negativos Encontrados \\" in youtube.

Ashwood was named for its proximity to Ash Butte, a butte with volcanic ash deposits on its sides, and to honor Whitfield T. Wood, who settled in the area in the 1870s. Ashwood post office was established in 1898. The Ashwood area was first used by the Native American Sahaptin and Northern Paiute people. After the Sahaptin were forced to move to the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in the 1850s, and the Northern Paiute were defeated in the 1870s, settlers moved into the area to raise cattle and sheep. Sheep ranching became an important local industry by 1900 because of the availability of the railroad in nearby Shaniko that facilitated the shipping of wool. Ashwood became a gold- and silver-mining boomtown in the 1910s. The Oregon King Mine was an important mine that was established during the early boom period. The minerals soon began to play out, however, and local residents turned back to ranching and agriculture as the mainstays of their economy. Ashwood is popular with rockhounds, as the area has an abundance of petrified wood, jasper, and thundereggs‚ÄîOregon's state rock.

Some correlations have been empirically shown. The fundamental plane is usually expressed as a relationship between the effective radius, average surface brightness and central velocity dispersion of normal elliptical galaxies. Any one of the three parameters may be estimated from the other two, as together they describe a plane that falls within their more general three-dimensional space. Properties correlated also include: color, density (of luminosity, mass, or phase space), luminosity, mass, metallicity, and, to a lesser degree, the shape of their radial surface brightness profiles. Motivation Many characteristics of a galaxy are correlated. For example, as one would expect, a galaxy with a higher luminosity has a larger effective radius. The usefulness of these correlations is when a characteristic that can be determined without prior knowledge of the galaxy's distance (such as central velocity dispersion ‚Äì the Doppler width of spectral lines in the central parts of the galaxy) can be correlated with a property, such as luminosity, that can be determined only for galaxies of a known distance. With this correlation, one can determine the distance to galaxies, a difficult task in astronomy. Correlations The following correlations have been empirically shown for elliptical galaxies: *Larger galaxies have fainter effective surface brightnesses (Gudehus, 1973).Gudehus, D. \\"Radius-parameter and surface brightness as a function of galaxy total magnitude for clusters of galaxies\\", Astronomical J., vol. 78, pp. 583‚Äì593 (1973) Mathematically speaking: R_e \\\\propto \\\\langle I \\\\rangle_e^{-0.83\\\\pm0.08} (Djorgovski & Davis 1987),Djorgovski, S., and Davis, M. \\"Fundamental properties of elliptical galaxies\\", Astrophys. J., vol. 313, pp. 50‚Äì69 (1987); downloadable through http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987ApJ...313...59D where R_e is the effective radius, and \\\\langle I \\\\rangle_e is the mean surface brightness interior to R_e. *As L_e = \\\\pi \\\\langle I \\\\rangle_e R_e^2 measuring observable quantities such as surface brightness and velocity dispersion, we can substitute the previous correlation and see that L_e \\\\propto \\\\langle I \\\\rangle_e \\\\langle I \\\\rangle_e^{-1.66} and therefore: \\\\langle I \\\\rangle_e \\\\sim L^{-3/2} meaning that more luminous ellipticals have lower surface brightnesses. *More luminous elliptical galaxies have larger central velocity dispersions. This is called the Faber‚ÄìJackson relation (Faber & Jackson 1976). Analytically this is: L_e \\\\sim \\\\sigma_o^4. This is analogous to the Tully‚ÄìFisher relation for spirals. *If central velocity dispersion is correlated to luminosity, and luminosity is correlated with effective radius, then it follows that the central velocity dispersion is positively correlated to the effective radius. Usefulness The usefulness of this three dimensional space \\\\left( \\\\log R_e, \\\\langle I \\\\rangle_e, \\\\log \\\\sigma_o \\\\right) is studied by plotting \\\\log \\\\, R_e against \\\\log \\\\sigma_o + 0.26 \\\\, \\\\mu_B, where \\\\mu_B is the mean surface brightness \\\\langle I \\\\rangle_e expressed in magnitudes. The equation of the regression line through this plot is: : \\\\log R_e = 1.4 \\\\,\\\\log \\\\sigma_o + 0.36 \\\\mu_B + {\\\\rm const.} or : R_e \\\\propto \\\\sigma_o^{1.4} \\\\langle I \\\\rangle_e^{-0.9} . Thus by measuring observable quantities such as surface brightness and velocity dispersion (both independent of the observer's distance to the source) one can estimate the effective radius (measured in kpc) of the galaxy. As one now knows the linear size of the effective radius and can measure the angular size, it is easy to determine the distance of the galaxy from the observer through the small-angle approximation. Variations An early use of the fundamental plane is the D_n - \\\\sigma_o correlation, given by: : \\\\frac{D_n}{\\\\text{kpc}} = 2.05 \\\\, \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_o}{100 \\\\, \\\\text{km}/\\\\text{s}}\\\\right)^{1.33} determined by Dressler et al. (1987). Here D_n is the diameter within which the mean surface brightness is 20.75 \\\\mu_B. This relationship has a scatter of 15% between galaxies, as it represents a slightly oblique projection of the Fundamental Plane. Fundamental Plane correlations provide insights into the formative and evolutionary processes of elliptical galaxies. Whereas the tilt of the Fundamental Plane relative to the naive expectations from the Virial Theorem is reasonably well understood, the outstanding puzzle is its small thickness. Interpretation The observed empirical correlations reveal information on the formation of elliptical galaxies. In particular, consider the following assumptions * From the virial theorem the velocity dispersion \\\\sigma, characteristic radius R, and mass M satisfy \\\\sigma^2 \\\\sim GM/R so that M \\\\sim \\\\sigma^2 R . * The relation between luminosity L and mean surface brightness (flux) I is L \\\\propto I R^2. * Assume homology which implies a constant mass to light ratio M/L. These relations imply that M \\\\propto L \\\\propto I R^2 \\\\propto \\\\sigma^2 R, therefore \\\\sigma^2 \\\\propto IR and so R \\\\propto \\\\sigma^2 I^{-1}. However, there are observed deviations from homology, i.e. M/L\\\\propto L^{\\\\alpha} with \\\\alpha=0.2 in the optical band. This implies that M \\\\propto L^{1+\\\\alpha} \\\\propto I^{1+\\\\alpha} R^{2+2\\\\alpha} \\\\propto \\\\sigma^2 R so R \\\\propto \\\\sigma^{2/(1+2\\\\alpha)} I^{-(1+\\\\alpha)/(1+2\\\\alpha)} so that R \\\\propto \\\\sigma^{1.42} I^{-0.86}. This is consistent with the observed relation. Two limiting cases for the assembly of galaxies are as follows. * If elliptical galaxies form by mergers of smaller galaxies with no dissipation, then the specific kinetic energy is conserved \\\\sigma^2 = constant. Using the above-mentioned assumptions implies that R \\\\propto I^{-1}. * If elliptical galaxies form by dissipational collapse then \\\\sigma\\\\propto (GM/R)^{1/2} increases as R decreases for constant M to satisfy the virial theorem and M\\\\propto L \\\\propto IR^2 implies that R\\\\propto I^{-0.5}. The observed relation R_e \\\\propto \\\\langle I \\\\rangle_e^{-0.83\\\\pm0.08} lies between these limits. Notes Diffuse dwarf ellipticals do not lie on the fundamental plane as shown by Kormendy (1987). Gudehus (1991)Gudehus, D. \\"Systematic bias in cluster galaxy data, affecting galaxy distances and evolutionary history\\", Astrophys. J., vol. 382, pp. 1‚Äì18 (1991) found that galaxies brighter than M_V=-23.04 lie on one plane, and those fainter than this value, M ', lie on another plane. The two planes are inclined by about 11 degrees.

Locating the oil field Geologists and geophysicists use seismic surveys to search for geological structures that may form oil reservoirs. The \\"classic\\" method includes making an underground explosion nearby and observing the seismic response, which provides information about the geological structures underground. However, \\"passive\\" methods that extract information from naturally occurring seismic waves are also used. Other instruments such as gravimeters and magnetometers are also used in the search for petroleum. Extracting crude oil normally starts with drilling wells into an underground reservoir. When an oil well has been tapped, a geologist (known on the rig as the \\"mudlogger\\") will note its presence. Historically in the United States, in some oil fields the oil rose naturally to the surface, but most of these fields have long since been used up, except in parts of Alaska. Often many wells (called multilateral wells) are drilled into the same reservoir, to an economically viable extraction rate. Some wells (secondary wells) may pump water, steam, acids or various gas mixtures into the reservoir to raise or maintain the reservoir pressure and economical extraction rate. Drilling The oil well is created by drilling a long hole into the earth with an oil rig. A steel pipe (casing) is placed in the hole, to provide structural integrity to the newly drilled well bore. Holes are then made in the base of the well to enable oil to pass into the bore. Finally, a collection of valves called a \\"Christmas tree\\" is fitted to the top; the valves regulate pressures and control flow. The drilling process comes under \\"upstream\\", one of the three main services in the oil industry, along with mid-stream and downstream. Oil extraction and recovery Primary recovery During the primary recovery stage, reservoir drive comes from a number of natural mechanisms. These include: natural water displacing oil downward into the well, expansion of the associated petroleum gas at the top of the reservoir, expansion of the associated gas initially dissolved in the crude oil, and gravity drainage resulting from the movement of oil within the reservoir from the upper to the lower parts where the wells are located. Recovery factor during the primary recovery stage is typically 5-15%. While the underground pressure in the oil reservoir is sufficient to force the oil (along with some associated gas) to the surface, all that is necessary is to place a complex arrangement of valves (the Christmas tree) on the well head to connect the well to a pipeline network for storage and processing. Sometimes pumps, such as beam pumps and electrical submersible pumps (ESPs), are used to bring the oil to the surface; these are known as artificial lifting mechanisms. Secondary recovery Over the lifetime of a well, the pressure falls. At some point there is insufficient underground pressure to force the oil to the surface. After natural reservoir drive diminishes, secondary recovery methods are applied. These rely on supplying external energy to the reservoir by injecting fluids to increase reservoir pressure, hence increasing or replacing the natural reservoir drive with an artificial drive. Secondary recovery techniques increase the reservoir's pressure by water injection, gas reinjection and gas lift. Gas reinjection and lift each use associated gas, carbon dioxide or some other inert gas to reduce the density of the oil-gas mixture, and thus improve its mobility. The typical recovery factor from water-flood operations is about 30%, depending on the properties of the oil and the characteristics of the reservoir rock. On average, the recovery factor after primary and secondary oil recovery operations is between 35 and 45%. Enhanced recovery Steam is injected into many oil fields where the oil is thicker and heavier than normal crude oil. Enhanced, or tertiary oil recovery methods, increase the mobility of the oil in order to increase extraction. Thermally enhanced oil recovery methods (TEOR) are tertiary recovery techniques that heat the oil, reducing its viscosity and making it easier to extract. Steam injection is the most common form of TEOR, and it is often done with a cogeneration plant. This type of cogeneration plant uses a gas turbine to generate electricity, and the waste heat is used to produce steam, which is then injected into the reservoir. This form of recovery is used extensively to increase oil extraction in the San Joaquin Valley, which yields a very heavy oil, yet accounts for ten percent of the United States' oil extraction. Fire flooding (In-situ burning) is another form of TEOR, but instead of steam, some of the oil is burned to heat the surrounding oil. Occasionally, surfactants (detergents) are injected to alter the surface tension between the water and the oil in the reservoir, mobilizing oil which would otherwise remain in the reservoir as residual oil.\\"New Billions In Oil\\" Popular Mechanics, March 1933 -- ie article on invention of water injection and detergents for oil recovery Another method to reduce viscosity is carbon dioxide flooding. Tertiary recovery allows another 5% to 15% of the reservoir's oil to be recovered. In some California heavy oil fields, steam injection has doubled or even tripled the oil reserves and ultimate oil recovery.Growth History of Oil Reserves in Major California Oil Fields During the Twentieth Century, USGS Bulletin 2172-H, 2005 For example, see Midway- Sunset Oil Field, California's largest oilfield. Tertiary recovery begins when secondary oil recovery is not enough to continue adequate extraction, but only when the oil can still be extracted profitably. This depends on the cost of the extraction method and the current price of crude oil. When prices are high, previously unprofitable wells are brought back into use, and when they are low, extraction is curtailed. The use of microbial treatments is another tertiary recovery method. Special blends of the microbes are used to treat and break down the hydrocarbon chain in oil, making the oil easy to recover. It is also more economical versus other conventional methods. In some states such as Texas, there are tax incentives for using these microbes in what is called a secondary tertiary recovery. Very few companies supply these. Recovery rates The amount of oil that is recoverable is determined by a number of factors, including the permeability of the rock, the strength of natural drives (the associated gas present, pressure from adjacent water or gravity), porosity of the reservoir rock, i.e. the rock storage capacity, and the viscosity of the oil. When the reservoir rocks are \\"tight\\", as in shale, oil generally cannot flow through, but when they are permeable, as in sandstone, oil flows freely. Estimated ultimate recovery Although recovery of a well cannot be known with certainty until the well ceases production, petroleum engineers often determine an estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) based on decline rate projections years into the future. Various models, mathematical techniques, and approximations are used. Shale gas EUR is difficult to predict, and it is possible to choose recovery methods that tend to underestimate decline of the well beyond that which is reasonable.  Health and safety  The oil and gas extraction workforce face unique health and safety challenges and is recognized by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues. During 2003‚Äì2013, the annual rate of occupational fatalities significantly decreased 36.3%; however, the number of work-related fatalities in the U.S. oil and gas extraction industry increased 27.6%, with a total of 1,189 deaths because the size of the workforce grew during this period. Two-thirds of all worker fatalities were attributed to transportation incidents and contact with objects or equipment. More than 50% of persons fatally injured were employed by companies that service wells. Hazard controls include land transportation safety policies and engineering controls such as automated technologies.

It is laid out in three books that discuss the theological views of the Hellenistic philosophies of Epicureanism, Stoicism, and Academic Skepticism. Writing De Natura Deorum belongs to the group of philosophical works which Cicero wrote in the two years preceding his death in 43 BC. He states near the beginning of Dƒì NƒÅt≈´rƒÅ De≈çrum that he wrote them both as a relief from the political inactivity to which he was reduced by the supremacy of Julius Caesar, and as a distraction from the grief caused by the death of his daughter Tullia. The dialogue is supposed to take place in Rome at the house of Gaius Aurelius Cotta. In the dialogue he appears as pontiff, but not as consul. He was made pontiff soon after 82 BC, and consul in 75 BC, and as Cicero, who is present at the dialogue as a listener, did not return from Athens till 77 BC, its fictional date can be set between the years 77 and 75 BC, when Cicero was about thirty years of age, and Cotta about forty-eight. The book contains various obscurities and inconsistencies which demonstrate that it was probably never revised by Cicero, nor published until after his death. For the content, Cicero borrowed largely from earlier Greek sources. However, the hasty arrangement by Cicero of authorities who themselves wrote independently of one another means that the work lacks cohesion, and points raised by one speaker are sometimes not countered by subsequent speakers. Contents The dialogue is on the whole narrated by Cicero himself, though he does not play an active part in the discussion. Gaius Velleius represents the Epicurean school, Quintus Lucilius Balbus argues for the Stoics, and Gaius Cotta speaks for Cicero's own Academic skepticism. The first book of the dialogue contains Cicero's introduction, Velleius' case for the Epicurean theology and Cotta's criticism of Epicureanism. Book II focuses on Balbus' explanation and defense of Stoic theology. Book III lays out Cotta's criticism of Balbus' claims. Cicero's conclusions are ambivalent and muted, \\"a strategy of civilized openness\\";Stephen Greenblatt, The Swerve: How the World Became Modern, 2011:69ff. he does, however, conclude that Balbus' claims, in his mind, more nearly approximate the truth (3.95). Book 1 In Book 1 Cicero visits the house of Cotta the Pontifex Maximus, where he finds Cotta with Velleius - a Senator and Epicurean, and Balbus supporter of the Stoics. Cotta himself is an Academic Skeptic, and he informs Cicero that they were discoursing on the nature of the gods. Velleius had been stating the sentiments of Epicurus upon the subject. Velleius is requested to go on with his arguments after recapitulating what he had already said. The discourse of Velleius consists of three parts: a general attack on Platonist and Stoic cosmology; a historical review of the earlier philosophers; and an exposition of Epicurean theology. Velleius raises the difficulty of supposing the creation of the universe to have taken place at a particular period of time, and questions the possible motive of a God in undertaking the work. The historical section (10-15), is full of inaccuracies and mis-statements, of which it is likely that Cicero himself was ignorant, since he has Cotta later praise this account. The purpose however is for Velleius to show that the Epicurean idea of God as a perfectly happy, eternal being, possessed of reason, and in human form, is the only tenable one, and the other differing opinions is regarded as proof of their worthlessness. In the remainder of the book, Cotta attacks the positions of Velleius with regard to the form of the gods, and their exemption from creation and providence. Book 2 In Book 2, Balbus gives the Stoics' position on the subject of the gods. He alludes to the magnificence of the world, and the prevalence of belief, and refers to the frequent appearance of the gods themselves in history. After referring to the practice of divination, Balbus proceeds to the \\"four causes\\" of Cleanthes as to how the idea of the gods is implanted in the minds of people: (1) a pre-knowledge of future events; (2) the great advantages we enjoy from nature; (3) the terror with which the mind is affected by thunder, tempests, and the like; (4) and the order and regularity in the universe. Balbus further contends that the world, or universe itself, and its parts, are possessed of reason and wisdom. He finally discusses the creation of the world, the providence of the gods, and denies \\"that a world, so beautifully adorned, could be formed by chance, or by a fortuitous concourse of atoms.\\" The problem of how to account for the presence of misery and disaster in a world providentially governed is only hurriedly touched upon at the end of the book. Book 3 In book 3 Cotta refutes the doctrines of Balbus. A large portion of this book, probably more than one third, has been lost. Cotta represents the appearances of gods as idle tales. There follows a gap in the text, following which Cotta attacks the four causes of Cleanthes. Cotta refutes the Stoic ideas on reason attributed to the universe and its parts. Ten chapters (16-25) are devoted to a disproportionately lengthy discussion of mythology, with examples multiplied to an inordinate extent. There follows another major gap in the text, at the end of which Cotta is seen attacking the doctrine of providential care for humans. Cicero states \\"The conversation ended here, and we parted. Velleius judged that the arguments of Cotta were the truest, but those of Balbus seemed to me to have the greater probability.\\" Influence The Christian writers Tertullian, Minucius Felix, Lactantius, and Augustine were acquainted with De Natura Deorum. This work, alongside De Officiis and De Divinatione, was highly influential on the philosophes of the 18th century. David Hume was familiar with the work and used it to style his own Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. Voltaire described De Natura Deorum and the Tusculan Disputations as \\"the two most beautiful books ever produced by the wisdom of humanity\\".'Les deux plus beaux ouvrages qu‚Äôait jamais √©crits la sagesse qui n‚Äôest qu‚Äôhumaine' [Voltaire, \\"Cic√©ron\\", Dictionnaire philosophique (1764); ≈íuvres compl√®tes (Garnier) 18:181] In 1811 a fourth book was 'discovered' and published by one 'P. Seraphinus' in Bologna. In this forgery Cicero asserts many points compatible with Christian and Catholic dogma, and even argues in favour of an authority equivalent to the Papacy. Scholarship This text is an important source of Epicurean, Stoic, and Academic Skeptic views on religion and theology because it supplements the scant primary texts that remain on these topics. In particular, heated scholarly debate has focused on this text's discussion at 1.43-44 of how the Epicurean gods may be said to \\"exist\\"; David Sedley, for example, holds that Epicureans, as represented in this text and elsewhere, think that \\"gods are our own graphic idealization of the life to which we aspire\\",David Sedley, Epicurus‚Äô Theological Innatism. In Fish and Saunders 2011: 29-52 whereas David Konstan maintains that \\"the Epicurean gods are real, in the sense that they exist as atomic compounds and possess the properties that pertain to the concept, or prolƒìpsis, that people have of them.\\"David Konstan, Epicurus on the Gods. In Fish and Saunders 2011: 53-71 Quotations * There is in fact no subject upon which so much difference of opinion exists, not only among the unlearned but also among educated men; and the views entertained are so various and so discrepant, that, while it is no doubt a possible alternative that none of them is true, it is certainly impossible that more than one should be so. (') (I, 2) * We, on the contrary, make blessedness of life depend upon an untroubled mind, and exemption from all duties. (We think a happy life consists in tranquility of mind).

(') (II, 2) * [It does not follow that], because not all the sick recover, medicine is a worthless science (') (II, 12) * Things perfected by nature are better than those finished by art. (') (II, 87) * Just as it is better to use no wine whatever in the treatment of the sick, because it is rarely beneficial and very often injurious, than to rush upon evident calamity in the hope of an uncertain recovery, so, I incline to think, it would have been better for the human race that that swift movement of thought, that keenness and shrewdness which we call reason, since it is destructive to many and profitable to very few, should not have been given at all, than that it should have been given so freely and abundantly.

He had a career with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, retiring as area administrator. He ran for the US Congress from the East River region of South Dakota, and was elected as the first Lakota to serve in the House of Representatives. He served five terms as a Republican United States Congressman from the (now obsolete) First District. Born on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, Reifel graduated from South Dakota State University. During World War II he achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. He worked for the Department of the Interior beginning in 1933, retiring as the Aberdeen, South Dakota area administrator of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in March 1960. Awarded a mid-career fellowship in public administration to Harvard University for a master's degree, he went on to earn his PhD in 1952. Elected to the Eighty-seventh Congress and to the four succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1961 ‚Äì January 3, 1971), Reifel chose not to run in 1970. Early life and education Reifel was born in a log cabin near Parmelee, South Dakota, on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. He was the son of Lucy Burning Breast, a Lakota Sioux, and William Reifel, of German descent. Ben Reifel was enrolled in the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and his Indian name means \\"Lone Feather\\" in English. He attended a Todd County school as well as the Rosebud Reservation boarding school as a child. He graduated at the age of sixteen from the eighth grade, speaking both English and Lakota. For three years Reifel worked on his family's farm before entering the School of Agriculture, a vocational high school in Brookings, South Dakota. After finishing high school in 1928, Reifel enrolled at South Dakota State College.AP, \\"Ben Reifel, 83, Dies; Former Congressman\\", New York Times, 4 January 1990, accessed 16 August 2011 He paid his own tuition for his first four years of schooling. He took out one of the first loans offered to Native American students under a Merriam Report-recommended Indian education program. Reifel graduated with a B.S. in agriculture in 1932. He was elected the President of the Students' Association during his senior year. Career Following his graduation in 1932, Reifel was hired by Hare's School in Mission, South Dakota as an adviser for boys. He began working at the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in 1933; he was assigned to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation as a farm agent to the Oglala Lakota. After a year, he was promoted to field agent at the Pierre, South Dakota regional headquarters. Reifel's duties included promoting the new programs of the Indian Reorganization Act, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934. Allotment of reservation lands was ended, to enable tribes to hold communal lands and better preserve their territories. Under the new law, tribes could reorganize self governments. They were encouraged to write constitutions and to use models of elected government proposed by the BIA, rather than the life chiefs previously supported by the clans. The American Indian people had endured hard times during the Great Depression, as well as the drought that caused Dust Bowl conditions in some parts of the Great Plains. Reifel was largely successful in garnering support for the Act. He started at Pine Ridge and later made his way to other reservations in South Dakota, ensuring that the programs of the Bureau were effective in the South Dakota reservations. World War II Reifel's BIA career was interrupted by World War II. In 1931, he had been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve. In March 1942, the Army ordered Reifel to active duty, and he served until July 1946. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Postwar career After being discharged, Reifel continued working for the BIA. He was selected as a Tribal Relations Officer and later promoted to the position as Superintendent of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota. Harvard In 1949 Reifel was awarded a scholarship to study public administration at Harvard University under a Civil Service Commission program for management development of career government officials. He earned his master's degree in 1949.\\"Ben Reifel\\", Biographical Directory of the US Congress, accessed 17 August 2011 He received a John Hay Whitney Foundation Opportunity Fellowship and completed his Doctorate in Public Administration in 1952. Following his graduation, Reifel returned to the BIA. He worked briefly at its national headquarters in Washington, D.C. before returning to the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation as Superintendent. Reifel later served as Superintendent at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. In 1955 he was promoted as the Area Director of the Aberdeen Area Office in Aberdeen, South Dakota. He was responsible for numerous employees and the application of federal programs and policies for American Indians of a three-state region: Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. He served as administrator up until three years before his retirement. Political career Rosebud Lakota), U.S. Representative from South Dakota's 1st Congressional District, 1961‚Äì71. South Dakota's congressional delegation in the 87th U.S. Congress. L-R: Ellis Y. Berry, Joseph H. Bottum, Karl E. Mundt, and Ben Reifel. In 1960, Reifel retired from the BIA and ran for Congress in South Dakota's 1st congressional district. At the time it included all of the counties east of the Missouri River, or East River. (The district was redrawn in 1931 to include 21 counties in the southeast part of the state.Official Congressional Directory, 73rd Congress (1933)) Reifel was elected by a substantial margin; he was the first person of Lakota or Sioux descent to serve in the US Congress. During the 1960s, he was the only American Indian in Congress. He served for five terms as Representative from South Dakota. Regarded as a \\"conservative Republican,\\" he was a thinker who prepared himself well on legislative matters. He could always give a substantial and thoughtful basis for his stand on issues. In Congress Reifel held several committee assignments. In his first term, he was appointed to the House Agricultural Committee; in his second, to the House Committee on Appropriations. He served as the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations subcommittee on Interior Department Affairs. He worked hard for farming interests in South Dakota and the Plains states in general, opposing cuts in farm support programs, pushing the Oahe Dam to supply water for irrigation, and similar matters. At the same time, he continued to work vigorously for American Indian education, with significant accomplishments. Opposing segregation, he believed that the key to ending the isolation of the Native American people was in educational programs that enrolled American Indian and non-Indian students together in modern progressive facilities (as was recommended by the 1928 Merriam Report), rather than keeping children in Indian-only boarding schools. Reifel supported the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and an increase in the minimum wage. Reifel was instrumental in getting the Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) of the US Geological Survey located in South Dakota. In addition, he gained support to keep Ellsworth Air Force Base as an active military base in the state. On a broader national level, he was instrumental in securing passage of legislation to create the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Arts Council. In 1970 Reifel decided not to seek reelection. While he intended to retire in 1971, he remained active, accepting an appointment by President Richard Nixon as chair of the National Capital Planning Commission, which has oversight over federal projects in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. He next served as Special Assistant for Indian programs to the Director of the National Park Service in the Department of the Interior. He also served as Interim Commissioner of Indian Affairs during the last two months of the Ford administration. Later years Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Reifel was a member of the Masons, Rotarians, and Elks. He also served on the National Council of the Protestant Episcopal Church and the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America. He also served as national president of Arrow, Inc., a Native American service organization. In 1977, Reifel became a trustee of the South Dakota Art Museum in Brookings. He served terms as the board president in 1982‚Äì83. He established the first Native American collection at the Art Museum in 1977, donating most of his personal collection.

The main commercial centre is located around Beaumont Street and boasts a vibrant multicultural atmosphere providing an array of restaurants, retail, fashion and commercial outlets along with day-to-day services such as pharmacies, banks, florists, hairdressers, fruit shops and delicatessens.Newcastle City Council, Discover our Suburbs  History  Hamilton became a municipality on 11 December 1871 and was named in honour of Edward Terrick Hamilton, who was then Governor of the board of directors of the Australian Agricultural Company (AA Co), from August 1857 to September 1898. The AA Co. were instrumental in the growth of the area, operating the mines and owning most of the land. The discovery of coal near St Peter's Church in the area known as Cameron's Hill, was the beginnings for the township of Hamilton (originally known as Pittown, Borehole or Happy Flat). A borehole was sunk and a shaft was completed in 1849 and was known as the D Pit, or borehole. Pittown grew up somewhere in the vicinity of today‚Äôs Beaumont street to service the needs of the miners and their families. By 1928 there were over 400 retail outlets in Hamilton, having increased from 80 in 1909. In 1947, Lettesi (a settler group made up of nearly 150 families from the village of Lettopalena in the Abruzzo Region of Italy), initially settled in Islington but they soon expanded into the nearby suburbs of Hamilton and Mayfield. This was primarily due to Islington's proximity to the BHP steel works. Before long Hamilton (especially Beaumont Street) was to become a strong community and commercial centre for Newcastle‚Äôs Italians.A History of Italian Settlement in New South Wales By the late fifties, the local Italian community began patronising the Australian owned Exchange Hotel, located on the corner of Beaumont and Denison Streets. It continues to be a regular meeting place for Italian men of Hamilton. The story of the Lettesi community in Hamilton can be read in the 'Hidden Hamilton' blog at http://hiddenhamilton.blogspot.com.au/2015/12/a-community-finds-its-place- lettesi.html.

Scholarship  Born in Montreal, Quebec, Andrew Godefroy read history at Concordia University. His early academic work was in the field of Canadian military history with a particular focus on Canada and the First World War. His first book published in 1998 - For Freedom and Honour? - a study of the death penalty in Canada's Canadian Expeditionary Force based on his undergraduate thesis, received critical praise in both media and academia circles and drew much attention to this long forgotten and politically sensitive subject. His graduate studies focused on innovation and conflict, earning him both an MA and Ph.D. in War Studies from the Royal Military College of Canada. His master's thesis examined U.S.-Canada cooperation and public policy in missile defence and space programs, while his post-graduate dissertation examined the nature of defence innovation, using the evolution of Canada's post war rocket and space program, and the relationships created between government, defence, and science and technology in Canada as his case study. He was the first person in Canada to declassify and examine several of the earliest records on Canadian post-war rocketry, upper atmospheric, and space research during the completion of his doctorate. His subsequent publication of this research initiated a fundamental reassessment of Canada's political and security roles in missile defence and outer space during the early Cold War period. During 2009-2010 he held the Canadian Visiting Research Fellowship in the Changing Character of Warfare Program at the University of Oxford. His research focused on why and how western armies change, with specific attention given to the evolution of British, American, and Canadian armies during the Cold War period and beyond.

In the United States, competitive \\"college hockey\\" refers to ice hockey played between colleges and universities within the governance structure established by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In Canada, the term \\"college hockey\\" refers to community college and small college ice hockey that currently consists of a varsity conference‚Äîthe Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference (ACAC) -- and a club league‚Äîthe British Columbia Intercollegiate Hockey League (BCIHL). \\"University hockey\\" is the term used for hockey primarily played at four-year institutions; that level of the sport is governed by U Sports. History Formation in the United States Malcolm Greene Chace Plaque inside Brown's Meehan Auditorium In fall of 1892, Malcolm Greene Chace, then a Freshman at Brown University, and Robert Wrenn, of Harvard University, were participating in a tennis tournament in Niagara Falls, Ontario. They both had dabbled a bit in a sport called ice polo; in Ontario, they met members of the Victoria Hockey Club, who introduced them to their similar game of ice hockey, and invited the two to visit Montreal to learn about their version of the game. The next winter, during Christmas break 1894-1895, Chace (who had by then transferred to Yale University) and Wrenn returned to Canada with a group of college students from several universities in tow. The cadre was one of the first American ice hockey teams and, after a 10-game tour of Canada, the students returned to their respective schools with the intent of founding collegiate ice hockey clubs. Yale, where Chace served as team captain and player-coach, was the first of the group to organize its team and in February 1896 the Bulldogs played the first two intercollegiate ice hockey games against Johns Hopkins University. While Johns Hopkins' program would cease for 90 years after 1898, Yale has served as a bedrock of college hockey ever since, playing continually for 125 seasons (as of 2020) including through the Great Depression and two world wars. Another game often cited as the \\"first game of intercollegiate ice hockey played in the United States\\" is a well-documented contest on January 19, 1898 at Franklin Park, Boston. Students from Brown took the train to Boston, where they commandeered a patch of a frozen pond in Franklin Park, asked pleasure skaters to give them room, and played students from Harvard. The details and outcome of the game were recorded in the following day's Boston Herald: Brown 6, Harvard 0. Within ten years all eight schools that would eventually comprise the Ivy League had played their first game as well as several other nearby teams. A lack of available ice was the primary concern for most schools as to whether they should start a program or continue supporting an existing team but that did not detract from the enthusiasm of the student bodies. Early style of play For at least the first 25 years of intercollegiate play the teams used a 7-on-7 format, a typical setup for turn of the century ice hockey. On a faceoff players were typically arranged as either four forwards, two point men and one goaltender or three forwards, one rover two point men and one goaltender. In the four forward setup the players were arranged from a faceoff as a left and right wing (or end) on the outside and a left and right center on the inside. The two point men and goaltender were typically arrayed in a line from center ice to the goal as cover point, point and goaltender. If viewed from above the players would form a ' T '. If a rover was used instead there would only be one center. The rover would line up either in a defensive or offensive position depending on the need. The remaining five positions would be unchanged. By the 1921‚Äì22 season college hockey adopted the increasingly more common 6‚Äìaside format with the abandonment of the second center/rover position and the two point men being renamed as 'defensemen'. The change from point men to defensemen comes as a result of an alignment change where instead of lining up one in front of the other, the two defensive players would play beside one another. The ice surfaces that the players played on were not of a uniform size. Rinks like the St. Nicholas Rink or Duquesne Gardens were few and far between and quite often teams would only be able to play on frozen ponds. Slightly more consistent were the length of games, however, there was no set game time. Most were played as two 20-minute halves but some games had 15- or 25-minute halves and others were one 40-minute period. Occasionally games were not able to be played entirely at one time so the teams would arrange to meet at a later date to finish the match. Overtime after a tie did not always occur, as ice times at public skating rinks were constrained, but even when teams were able to play extra frames the rules were somewhat flexible; because there were no lights illuminating the ponds, games could only be played while the sun was shining and in the winter months dusk came quickly. The teams would attempt to finish the game with a winner decided but even after multiple overtimes ties did result. Stabilizing the game The two rinks at Harvard Stadium From the start college hockey teams were rarely in a place of surety. In the 10 years since Johns Hopkins' exit in 1898 at least a dozen teams were forced to cancel seasons or suspend their program entirely, including some of the more financially sound institutions like Cornell University and Brown University. The two main factors in this were interest from the student body and the lack of available or good ice. While the interest conundrum required a more nuanced solution, the ice troubles had a more tangible answer. Teams near to public skating rinks would be able to hold their games at venues where ice conditions could be ensured but at the start, with so few available, some programs came up with novel solutions. One such idea came from Harvard University who, after completing construction of their football stadium in 1904, decided to erect two open-air rinks on the field for the team to use. As rinks continued to be built in areas near to the colleges, specifically the Boston Arena, New Haven Arena and Philadelphia Ice Palace, college teams had more and more ice rinks available to them and with most using artificial ice the teams were no longer dependent on weather conditions. Owing to the popularity of the game the first on-campus, purpose-built arena was constructed by Princeton University in 1923. Most schools were content with buying ice time from local rink operators while others simply didn't want to fund the building of their own version of the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. As the weather warmed in the 1930s and 40s many of these teams would be forced to decide whether they were willing to financially support their ice hockey programs or not. Army, for instance, had Smith Rink built in 1930 while Cornell struggled with the ice on Beebe Lake until after World War II. World War I aftermath The vast majority of teams ceased operating in 1917 after the United States entered World War I. This made sense as many of the students who would otherwise be playing had instead joined the military. Because the war ended in November 1918 most of the teams returned to the ice for the 1918‚Äì19 season and while the game continued to grow around New England an interesting development happened shortly after the armistice was signed. Colleges in the midwest began their own ice hockey programs. At the beginning these were typically restricted to upper-echelon universities like the University of Minnesota or the University of Michigan but some of the smaller schools got into the game as well. From the MIAC's foundation in 1920, member schools have played ice hockey and were able to establish the first consistent lower-tier competition in college hockey. Surviving the Depression While college ice hockey flourished in the 1920s the Great Depression did have an impact on the game in the '30s. Most schools that had established programs made the effort to keep their teams going but some less-acclaimed teams like Pennsylvania or Columbia decided that ice hockey wasn't worth the cost. Some of the smaller schools like Rensselaer had no choice but to suspend their programs as they did not have the resources that a Harvard or Yale did. After the first half of the 1930s, however, the depression lessened and schools were able to found or restart their programs. The game continued to expand west with the addition of Gonzaga, USC, UCLA and others, however, none of the Pacific-coast teams would make it to the 1950s. World War II hiatus As had happened during the first world war, the majority of universities suspended their ice hockey teams during World War II. Most of teams that were active just prior to the U.S.' entry played during the 1942‚Äì43 season but were mothballed afterwards. There were notable exceptions such as Yale and Dartmouth, who continued to play through the duration of the war, but many teams returned to the ice for an abbreviated 1945‚Äì46 season. One benefit to college hockey that resulted from the war was the G.I. Bill which helped returning servicemen pay for a college education. With a much larger student body and a resulting influx in cash, colleges were more able to afford to support an ice hockey team. NCAA Tournament By 1947 college ice hockey was still a regional sport, being localized in the northeast and northern Midwest (with a few exceptions) but despite the low number of teams playing, the NCAA finally instituted a national tournament. At the start the tournament invited two participants from the two regions: east and west. The east region was loosely defined as any college east of the Pennsylvania-Ohio border with all other teams being lumped into the west region. The tournament was held at the Broadmoor World Arena for the first ten years. Partially due to a lack of competition, Michigan was invited to participate in each of the first ten tournaments and won six National Championships in that time. NCAA Bowling Green vs. Michigan hockey game The National Collegiate Athletic Association has conducted national championships for men's ice hockey since 1948, and women's ice hockey since 2001. U.S. college hockey players must be deemed eligible for NCAA competition by the NCAA Eligibility Center, a process that examines a student-athlete's academic qualifications and amateur status. Players who have participated in the Canadian Hockey League or any professional hockey league are considered ineligible. Men's U.S. college hockey is a feeder system to the National Hockey League. As of the 2010‚Äì11 season, 30 percent of NHL players (a total of 294) had U.S. college hockey experience prior to turning professional, an increase of 35 percent from the previous 10 years. That percentage has been maintained the past three seasons, with a record 301 NHL players coming from college hockey in 2011‚Äì12. Men One hundred thirty-eight colleges and universities sponsor men's ice hockey in the NCAA's three divisions.NCAA Winter Sports Division I NCAA Division I will have 61 ice hockey teams as of the 2020‚Äì21 season, an increase of one from 2019‚Äì20. Of these schools, 21 are Division II or III athletic programs that \\"play up\\" to Division I in hockey, and 16 of the full Division I members are in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Seven of the FBS schools compete in the Big Ten Conference; six are full conference members and the seventh is a single-sport member. The NCAA Division I Championship is a 16-team, single- elimination tournament, divided into four, 4-team regional tournaments. The winner of each regional advances to the Frozen Four to compete for the national championship. For many years, 5 teams earned automatic bids through winning conference tournament championships, while 11 earned at-large berths through a selection committee. With the addition of the Big Ten Hockey Conference for the 2013‚Äì14 season, the tournament now features 6 automatic qualifiers, and 10 at-large bids. The ranking system that is used to determine the at-large teams is known as the Pairwise Rankings, which uses a number of ranking factors to create a scoring system for all NCAA Division I teams. A map of all NCAA Division I men's hockey teams. In 2019‚Äì20, 60 schools competed in Division I, with 59 of them organized into six conferences, plus one team (Arizona State) playing as an independent program with no conference affiliation. The conferences are: *Atlantic Hockey Association *Big Ten Conference *ECAC Hockey *Hockey East Association *National Collegiate Hockey Conference *Western Collegiate Hockey Association The WCHA is now likely to disband as a men's conference after the 2020‚Äì21 season. Seven of the 10 men's members announced in 2019 that they would leave after the 2020‚Äì21 season; these schools have since announced that they will revive the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, which had previously operated from 1971 to 2013. An eighth WCHA men's member, Alabama‚ÄìHuntsville (UAH), had also filed papers to leave after the 2020‚Äì21 season, but shortly thereafter dropped the sport entirely due to fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a successful fundraising drive led by UAH hockey alumni resulted in the team being reinstated one week later. Another member, Alaska Anchorage, later announced it would drop hockey (plus two other sports) after the 2020‚Äì21 school year. The Ivy League recognizes ice hockey champions for both sexes, but it does not sponsor the sport; it instead uses the results of regular- season ECAC Hockey matches involving two Ivy League schools to extrapolate an Ivy champion (all six Ivy League schools that sponsor varsity hockey do so for both men and women, and compete in the ECAC). The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference sponsored D-I men's hockey, but dropped the sport in 2003. The most recent addition to D-I men's ice hockey is LIU, which added the sport in 2020‚Äì21. The school has yet to announce a conference affiliation, but is speculated to be making overtures to Atlantic Hockey. The next addition to D-I men's ice hockey will be St. Thomas (Minnesota), which will move from Division III in 2021‚Äì22. After the end of the 2020‚Äì21 school year, St. Thomas will be expelled from its longtime D-III home of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference due to perceptions by most other league members that it had grown too strong for the conference. The Summit League, a D-I all-sports league that does not sponsor hockey, soon issued the school an invitation, and worked with the school to obtain a waiver of an NCAA rule that would have otherwise prevented a direct move to D-I. Shortly after St. Thomas' D-I move was confirmed, it was unveiled as the eighth member of the revived CCHA. The Hobey Baker Memorial Award honors the top player in men's Division I hockey. The Mike Richter Award honors the top goaltender in Division I. Division II The NCAA does not currently sponsor a championship in Division II, as there is only one conference that currently sponsors hockey, the Northeast-10 Conference. The NCAA conducted a Division II national championship from 1978 to 1984 and also from 1993 to 1999. Division III The 84 programs in Division III hockey are part of 10 conferences: *Commonwealth Coast Conference *Massachusetts State College Athletic Conference *Middle Atlantic Conference *Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference *New England Hockey Conference *New England Small College Athletic Conference *Northern Collegiate Hockey Association *State University of New York Athletic Conference *United Collegiate Hockey Conference *Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference The NCAA has conducted a Division III national championship since 1984. The current championship format is a 12-team (formerly 11-team), single- elimination bracket. Women A map of all NCAA Division I women's hockey teams. There are 93 colleges and universities that sponsor women's ice hockey in two divisions: National Collegiate and Division III. National Collegiate There are 41 teams in the National Collegiate division (commonly referred to as Division I). All of them play in five conferences: *College Hockey America (CHA) *ECAC Hockey *Hockey East *New England Women's Hockey Alliance (NEWHA) *Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) The women's side of the WCHA is all but certain to continue in operation despite the likely demise of the conference's men's side in 2021; the conference has announced the entry of a new women's member in 2021. The National Collegiate championship is an 8-team, single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion. The Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award is awarded annually by USA Hockey to the top player in women's Division I hockey. The most recent school to add varsity women's hockey at this level is LIU. In September 2018, the school's Brooklyn campus announced it would add women's ice hockey for the 2019‚Äì20 season, joining the fledgling NEWHA. Shortly thereafter, the university announced it would merge the Division I Brooklyn athletic program with the Division II program of its Post campus effective in July 2019. The new athletic program, later unveiled as the LIU Sharks, inherited Brooklyn's Division I membership; the hockey team joined the NEWHA on the announced schedule. Two schools will begin National Collegiate play in 2021‚Äì22: * The aforementioned St. Thomas (Minnesota) will join the WCHA, which also worked with the Summit League in the school's bid to move directly from D-III. * Stonehill will add the sport in 2021‚Äì22 and join the NEWHA. The newest National Collegiate conference is the NEWHA, formed in 2017 as a scheduling alliance between the then-current National Collegiate independents. It formally organized as a conference in 2018 and received NCAA recognition in 2019. Division III There are 67 teams in Division III in eight conferences: *Colonial Hockey Conference *ECAC West *Middle Atlantic Conference *Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference *New England Hockey Conference *New England Small College Athletic Conference *Northern Collegiate Hockey Association *Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference The Division III championship is a 9-team, single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion. U Sports Windsor Lancers and Western Mustangs during 2013 CIS (now U Sports) playoffs. University hockey teams in Canada compete in leagues as part of U Sports, the national governing body for Canadian university athletics (in Canadian English, the term \\"college\\" is reserved for schools that would be called \\"junior\\", \\"community\\", or \\"technical\\" colleges in the U.S.). U Sports sponsors both men's and women's hockey. Like in the United States, teams compete in athletic conferences based on geographical locations of the schools. Unlike the NCAA, U Sports does not award players with athletic scholarships, resulting in a lack of divisional separation such as found between NCAA divisions. Individual conferences hold postseason tournaments, followed by the round-robin U Sports championship tournament in late March. NAIA In 2015, a group of member schools in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) began working to add the sport to the organization. The NAIA originally sponsored a men's ice hockey championship from 1968 to 1984 when it was discontinued due to many of the schools with teams leaving the NAIA for the NCAA. A few NAIA schools continued to sponsor the sport as varsity-club teams in the ACHA. A growing number of schools have added ice hockey as members of the ACHA over the past 5‚Äì10 years. In 2016, several NAIA institutions that sponsor men's ice hockey teams announced the formation of a coaches association and a new division for NAIA ice hockey program to begin play during the 2017‚Äì18 season. In 2017, The Wolverine- Hoosier Athletic Conference (WHAC) became the first current conference in the NAIA to offer the sport and host a conference championship. ACHA Lindenwood University vs. University of Illinois The American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) is the sanctioning body for non-NCAA or \\"club\\" ice hockey in the United States. The organization provides structure, regulations and promotes the quality of collegiate ice hockey. Teams separated into three men's and two women's divisions with over 300 teams from across the United States. The recruiting process, rules and regulations, and player eligibility standards parallel that of NCAA Division III. Sometimes, ACHA and NCAA will play games against each other to complete each of their season schedules.http://thehockeywriters.com/rise-acha-division-hockey/>.

CFL career Henley was drafted in 1960 by the NFL's Green Bay Packers in the 15th round (173rd overall), but was traded to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in Ontario, Canada. This was an excellent opportunity, as he embarked on a 16-year career (1960 to 1975) of CFL greatness. In his early Tiger-Cat career, he was used mostly as a defensive back with a unique tackling style which relied on his skill in taking down players with body angle and leverage rather than brute force. In his later years with the Tiger- Cats, he played more as a receiver when it became obvious to everyone, coaches, players and fans alike, that he was a superlative offensive player. As a defensive back he intercepted 59 passes for 916 yards and 5 touchdowns, and was selected as an All Star nine times. An excellent two-way player, as a wide receiver he was an All Star for the 10th time in 1972. He also won the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award that year in which the Tiger-Cats won the Grey Cup at their home field, Ivor Wynne Stadium in Hamilton, Ontario. He played in 7 Grey Cup games, winning 4: the 51st Grey Cup of 1963, the 53rd Grey Cup of 1965 (the so-called Wind Bowl), the 55th Grey Cup of 1967 when Saskatchewan was mashed 24-1, and the 60th Grey Cup of 1972, losing 3: the 49th Grey Cup of 1961, the 50th Grey Cup of 1962, and the 52nd Grey Cup of 1964. Post-football career While still playing football in Hamilton, Garney was hired at the University of Guelph by athletic director, Bill Mitchell. Henley served as the assistant athletic director, advisor to the football team and taught in the Physical Education program. He also took over the Gryphon Basketball program. Despite several winless seasons Garney gradually built the program into a contender. In 1973-74, Garney coached the team to its first CIAU national championship. After his playing days, he became the athletic director and coach at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, and Brock University in Ontario. From 1989 to 1993, he was hired as defense coach with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. As coach he made another appearance in Grey Cup in 1989 losing to Saskatchewan in the final minutes. He also served as the director of Football Operations for the Ottawa Rough Riders from 1995-1996\\\\. His teams had a combined 6-30 record. In 1996, Garney moved back to his home state of South Dakota after 36 years in Canada. He finished his career as athletic director at his alma mater, Huron University. After Huron University closed, Garney became a general manager for Professional Transportation Inc transporting railroad engineers and conductors. He retired in 2013. It was often said that the always thin Henley did not look the part of a successful athlete. He was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1979, the University of Guelph Athletics Hall of Fame on October 4, 1985, the College Football Hall of Fame in 2004, and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2015.http://oshof.ca/index.php/component/k2/item/211-garney-henley Henley was voted the sixth greatest CFL player in a poll conducted by Canadian Sports network TSN in 2006.

Palace of Banganapalle Nawab Side View Of Palace Princely history Banganapalle Flag Sultan Ismail Adil Shah of Bijapur conquered Banganapalle from Raja Nanda Chakravathy ca. 1601. He conferred the command of the fort and surrounding districts on his victorious general, Siddhu Sumbal, who held them until 1665. Muhammad Beg Khan-e Rosebahani succeeded him as commander of the fort and perpetual fiefholder of the surrounding jagir. He died without natural male heirs, leaving his possessions to his grandson or adopted son and namesake, Muhammad Beg Khan Najm-i-Sani, entitled Faiz Ali Khan Bahadur. The latter secured confirmation of his rights following the Mughal conquest of Bijapur, through the intervention of his maternal uncle Nawab Khwaja Muhammad Mubariz Khan Bahadur, who served as Aurangzeb's Subedar of the Deccan. Faiz Ali Khan Bahadur was son of Nawab Muhammad Taqi Khan Bahadur. The family of Faiz Ali Khan Bahadur, along with those of the Nawabs of Cambay and of Masulipatam, descend from Amir Yawar Ahmad Khan Najm-i-Sani, sometime vicegerent under Shah Ismail Safawi of Persia. They migrated to India during the reign of Emperor Akbar, married into the Indian Mughal aristocracy and rose to high military commands. Faiz Ali and his elder brother Fazl Ali were military officers under the Bijapur Sultans and transferred their allegiance to the Mughals after their conquest of the Deccan. Fazl Ali received Chenchelimala in fief, at about the same time as his brother had received Banganapalle. On his death, Fazl Ali left his jagir to his younger brother. The ruling family of Banganapalle trace their descent from Sayyid Muhammad Khan Rizvi, sometime Grand Vizier to Shah Abbas II of Persia. Tahir Ali, his younger son is said to have been forced to leave Persia due to the jealousy of his elder brother. He entered Bijapur as a faqir where he was taken into the service of a Minister to Adil Shah. He married one of the King's daughters and rose in prominence. Tahir was murdered by his brothers-in-law, forcing his widow to flee into the Carnatic with her two orphaned sons. The younger son, Sayyid Muhammad Khan Naqdi, became a mansabdar under Sadu'llah Khan. He married the granddaughter of Faiz Ali Khan, by whom he left two sons. The elder of the two, Husain Ali, inherited Banganapalle on the death of his childless maternal uncle, Nawab Fazl Ali Khan III Bahadur. The younger brother, Asad Ali, inherited Chenchelimala in jagir. Sayyid Husain Ali Khan Bahadur reigned during the ascendancy of Hyder Ali, and was forced into an uneasy compromise by which he became a senior military officer in his service. At his death in 1783, his minor eldest son, Ghulam Muhammad Ali, succeeded under the guardianship of his uncle. Within a year both fell foul of Tipu Sultan, and fled with the rest of their family to Hyderabad. Uncle and nephews returned in 1789, defeated Tipu's forces and resumed control. Shortly afterwards, Asad Ali Khan gave his daughter in marriage to his nephew and bestowed his as dowry. Thereafter, Chenchelimala has formed part of the Banganapalle state. Ghulam Muhammad Ali, enjoyed a long reign, but becoming wary of governing his small state, abdicated his rights in favour of his eldest son, Husain Ali II in 1822. The latter, however, proved to be a poor financial manager and began accumulating large debts. Several attempts by the government to introduce reforms proved fruitless, until exasperation resulted in his deposition in 1832. The government annexed Banganapalle to the Madras Presidency and the Nawab retired to Hyderabad on a pension. Financial and administrative reforms having restored the state to solvency, the Governor of Madras-in-Council decided to return Banganapalle to the former Nawab in 1848. He died without male heirs, before the government issued orders for the transfer. Consequently, the act of restoration was effected in favour of his elder son-in-law and nephew, Ghulam Muhammad Ali. The latter also died without male heirs in 1868, succeeded in turn by his son-in-law and nephew. Sayyid Fath-i-Ali Khan proved to be a model ruler during the early years of his reign, receiving many honours during his lifetime. Alas, financial mismanagement during his latter years reduced the state once more to the brink of insolvency. Therefore, the government imposed an administrator only a few months before his death in 1905. Sayyid Ghulam Muhammad Ali Khan III succeeded his father as a minor in 1905, but was invested with full ruling powers three years later, after the finances and administration had been reformed. His reign saw momentous changes and was, by most accounts, stable and effective. He died in 1922 leaving his little state to his eldest son, Mir Fazl Ali Khan III. Within a few years of Mir Fazl Ali Khan III succession, the state was back in pecuniary embarrassment. Several attempts at persuading the Nawab to curb his expenditure failed. Drought and the world economic depression worsened the financial crisis, eventually prompting the government to establish yet another period of administration. This too failed to achieve its effects as the Nawab continued to exercise considerable power within the state and to hamper the efforts of the administrator. The government eventually ordered him to reside outside the state in 1939. These orders being rescinded and the Nawab permitted to resume charge shortly before independence, so that he could exercise his sovereignty in making an empty choice to join India or Pakistan in 1947. Within a year, the old Nawab was succeeded by his only son, Nawab Mir Ghulam 'Ali Khan. The latter appeared on the national stage very briefly in 1970 to challenge the government of Indira Gandhi when she first attempted to de-recognise the princes. He won his battle when the Supreme Court decided that the Prime Minister's action as void in law. However, she introduced new legislation following her subsequent election victory which nullified the courts decision a year later. Salute It is a 9-gun salute granted state.

The improvements can be measured in terms of accuracy or reaction time, and can occur when the repeated stimuli are either identical or similar to previous stimuli. These improvements have been shown to be cumulative, so as the number of repetitions increases the responses get continually faster up to a maximum of around seven repetitions. These improvements are also found when the repeated items are changed slightly in terms of orientation, size and position. The size of the effect is also modulated by the length of time the item is presented for and the length time between the first and subsequent presentations of the repeated items. Description Repetition priming can occur without a person being aware of either the repeats or the improvements in his/her response, so it is generally thought to involve implicit memory processes that are dissociable from explicit memory processes. This idea has support from findings that amnesic patients with damage to limbic and/or diencephalic structures show measurable repetition priming effects but have deficits on explicit measures of memory. However, some researchers suggest that implicit and explicit memory systems are not in fact separate. Repetition priming has also been associated with attentional processes, stimulus expectation and episodic memory. Research into repetition priming has been used to investigate the nature of mechanisms underlying the behavioural effects of rapid learning. In utilizing measures of repetition suppression, the putative neural correlate of repetition priming, and measuring changes in the neural response associated with changing the presented stimuli, researchers are attempting to index regions and their processing biases along perceptual, conceptual and response dimensions. This area of research is based on multiple measurement methods from single cell recordings to multi-regional measurements using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has also been used to temporarily 'lesion' (inactivate) specific regions and so get an indication of the necessity of those regions in processing specific dimensions of the presented stimuli. Much of this research has been focused on the visual domain, however auditory and olfactory processes have also been investigated.  Theories and models  Numerous models have been put forward to explain behavioural efficiencies that are gained with repeated presentations of the same or similar stimuli. These are outlined below. Fatigue In this model the attenuation of a neural response is hypothesised to be due to an overall reduction in the amplitude of a neuron's firing. Whether this reduction occurs across all neurons that responded to the initial stimulus or just the critical subset of those that initially responded maximally, is still unclear. However, evidence does suggest that a mechanism like this reduces redundant neural firing and enhances efficiencies in processing in the early visual cortex. Sharpening Along similar lines is the idea that repetition causes the neurons that are less relevant to the representation of the stimulus to stop firing when that stimulus is repeated. In this way the representation is supported by a gradually sparser response, resulting in an adaptive reduction in metabolic requirements and increased efficiencies in information transmission through the neural hierarchy. This could be the result of lateral inhibition within representational levels in a competitive Hebbian learning system, where strong connections get stronger and inhibit the weaker connections. Much of the evidence for this comes from primate studies of the inferotemporal cortex and single cell recordings with long training periods. However, decreases in firing rate over short-term training on repeated stimuli appear to be greatest in those cells that initially respond with the highest activation rate, in line with the fatigue model above. Facilitation The key concept in this model is that information travels faster through the network when the current stimulus representation overlaps with a previous representation, driven by more rapid onset of neural activation with repeated presentations. fMRI studies have been used in an attempt to measure these potential latency differences but the temporal resolution is not very precise and single cell recordings typically do not show shortened latencies to repeated stimuli. Another possible explanation of facilitation is synaptic potentiation within an attractor neural network model where repetition decreases the settling time as the attractor basin deepens and so increases the overall speed of processing. Reduced prediction error/stimulus expectation When a stimulus is repeated top-down feedback modulates the neural response of earlier processing regions, with reduced neural activation and improved behavioural responses reflecting fulfilled expectations. The idea for this comes from predictive coding theories and Bayesian statistics and has some support in fMRI studies manipulating stimulus expectation. However, the results may also reflect the involvement of attention, which seems to have a modulatory effect on the extent of priming elicited. Neural synchrony This theory is based on the idea that because downstream neurons are sensitive to both the firing rates and the timing of those inputs, efficiencies in processing may be gained through synchronised activation. Evidence of synchronisation associated with repeated stimuli include phase locking found between two regions of the cat visual cortex while measuring spike synchronisation for trained compared with novel stimuli and suppressed firing and increased synchrony of spikes with repetition of odour puffs to locust's antennae. Evidence using EEG and MEG suggests that stimulus repetition in humans results in increased synchrony between distinct cortical regions, often the same regions that show reduced local neural activity (see repetition suppression below). In one study, the timing of this across-region synchronization predicted the amount of behavioral facilitation seen with repetition priming, suggestive of a close link between synchrony and behavior. Stimulus-response binding This theory suggests that repetition priming is a result of binding the initial stimulus directly to the response while bypassing the intervening layers of computation. The mechanism mediating this direct binding has not been clarified but several hypotheses have been put forward. One theory explains it as a race between automatic activation of a previous stimulus-response route and the reengagement of the \\"algorithmic\\" route and another theory suggests the operation of an \\"action-trigger\\" where repeated stimuli trigger the previous response through perceptual or conceptual associations with the original stimulus. In support of this theory is evidence of a response congruency effect, which would be expected from these stimulus-response bindings. The increased synchrony between regions discussed above could be a neural correlate of stimulus-response binding.  Neural correlates   Repetition suppression  The phenomenon of repetition suppression, a reduction in neural activity when stimuli are repeated, is thought to depend on processing overlaps between repeated items and is generally considered to be the neural correlate of repetition priming. As such it has been used extensively in research investigating the nature of representations across various levels of the visual processing hierarchy. In doing so researchers have found that repetition suppression appears to occur on multiple processing levels; dependent on the stimuli being processed and the processing level at which the experimental manipulation is directed; with reductions in neural activity to repeated stimuli occurring in regions involved with the initial processing of those features. However, care must be taken in interpreting the results of these studies as the relationship between repetition suppression and repetition priming has not been definitively established.  Repetition enhancement  Although repetition priming is most often associated with neural attenuation for repeated presentation of stimuli, increases in neural responses have also been measured in a number of experimental contexts. For example, when performing mathematical calculations, when repeated stimuli are degraded, in studies involving a backward masking paradigm and when stimuli have no pre-existing associations or meaning.

Portrayed by Elizabeth Hendrickson from September 27 to November 28, 2001, the character was one of the more popular additions to the series, having gained a significant following after only three months. When she was killed off, the popularity and loyal following the character had obtained resulted in Hendrickson being brought back as the character's identical twin sister, Maggie Stone. Background Audition and character concept The writers scripted Frankie's birth date to be on April 26, 1982, two years older than Bianca.Birth date given on-air on All My Children with Frankie's identical twin sister, Maggie Stone. The two being identical twins, were stated to share the same birthday. Actress Elizabeth Hendrickson had been auditioning for All My Children for over a year before acquiring the role of Frankie, and had originally auditioned for the role of Bianca Montgomery. The producers, however, felt that she was better suited for the part of Frankie Stone, a new character head writer Richard Culliton was scripting for an upcoming murder mystery storyline. Hendrickson approached the audition in a calm demeanor. \\"Going into this audition,\\" she stated, \\"I was very relaxed, not only because I've been there like a dozen times, but I thought I had no shot at all. Frankie's character is nothing like me!! I was told she was tomboyish yet sexy. I thought to myself, how can I pull that off? So I threw on a tight little baseball shirt and just went in and did it.\\" Hendrickson further relayed, \\"About two weeks later, my agent told me that it was between me and another girl and my tape was going to be tested. I for sure thought I didn't get the part. I always make my best impression in person. I feel that audition tapes are so impersonal. About a week later, I found out the news and believe me I was ecstatic.\\" Characterization and introduction The writers detailed Frankie to be a wisecracking tomboy with feminine sex appeal. Hendrickson described the character as someone who \\"would never in her right mind get all dolled up.\\" So when a scene finally called for the character to, in fact, wear a dress, Hendrickson stated that it did not feel right. \\"I've really become that character when I'm on set,\\" she revealed. \\"So I played that uncomfortable feeling throughout the scene, I think it worked.\\" Other aspects adding depth to Frankie were her \\"rough around the edges\\" personality and vulnerability, the character being a complex blend of both, something Hendrickson found challenging but admired: \\"I really wanted to get that across. Even though her intentions were not always good, she always yearned for love from unexpected places.\\" Frankie's debut on the series is what Hendrickson describes as her most memorable day as part of the All My Children cast. She was nervous about playing opposite legendary soap opera diva Susan Lucci, and did not know how to introduce herself: Portrayal Portraying Frankie called for Hendrickson to be somewhat androgynous. She was not sure herself of her character's sexual orientation or true motives when interacting with most characters. \\"At first,\\" she cited, \\"in the description of the character, they alluded to the fact that she was a lesbian. Then when I started working, I went to Jean (Dadario Burke), the executive producer, and I asked 'Is she?' She said, 'Well, she's a con artist. You read your script and make the decision yourself.'\\" Hendrickson theorized that when the writers saw the chemistry between Bianca and Frankie, \\"that's when they started pushing the fact that she was a lesbian.\\" When it came down to Frankie's true purpose on the show, however, she was merely a plot device, a soon-to-be victim in order to initiate a murder mystery storyline. At the time, Hendrickson found humor in her character's demise, citing that a character can always come back. Though the obstacle to resurrecting Frankie was the fact that Frankie's dead body was seen onscreen and on the floor for hours, this did not stop Hendrickson and her co-stars from speculating: \\"Frankie's body was found. We have this running joke that it wasn't Frankie, it was Maggie this whole time, posing as Frankie. Maggie knew that she was in trouble, so she called Frankie to come, and in reality Maggie was the one who was killed and Frankie is still alive.\\" When asked in an interview if she had any reservations about taking the part of Frankie due to the character's potential romance with Bianca, Hendrickson stated that she did not, and that she loves roles that are challenging. This one happened to be a type of role she had never portrayed before.  Reception  Frankie had an immediate impact on viewers. Within a week, fans were fond of the character. Frankie dead on the floor in her room. The imagery of the character's death and her departure from the series significantly impacted viewers. Frankie's death also had an impact; fans believed she was killed off due to the show's fear of portraying a homosexual romance, since the character was already being developed as a romantic interest for Bianca. Head writer at the time, Richard Culliton, however, stated that he had already planned for Frankie to die in his murder mystery storyline. Despite Culliton's explanation, viewers were largely disappointed. The character's identical twin sister, Maggie Stone, was brought on instead, as a result of fans campaigning for Hendrickson's return.

Imperial College Radio pioneered a new system of broadcast, known as Leaky feeder and was the first station to be licensed by the Home Office for the use of this technique.http://www.johnallen.com/icradio/press.html IC Radio Press Coverage For a short period in 1989, IC Radio broadcast on FM under a Test and Development license, but this way never expanded into a full FM license. In 2001 it moved to its current location, in the West Basement of Beit Quad over the internet www.icradio.com and, since 2004, on 1134 AM in Wye.  Studios  Historically, Imperial College Radio consisted of two studios, \\"Southside\\" and \\"Northside\\", named after the accommodation blocks under which they were situated. Southside was the main broadcast studio, whilst Northside was primarily designated as a recording/production studio. The two studios were linked via audio cables which ran through the College's system of service tunnels, enabling communications, and the ability for the Southside studio to broadcast the output of the Northside studio. After relocating to the basement of Beit Quad in 2001, Imperial College Radio combined both studios in a single building, but retained its two-studio setup, with one studio focussed towards recording and another to live broadcast. Both studios were also greatly upgraded in terms of equipment.  Crocodile Club  The Alumni association for Imperial College Radio is known as The Crocodile Club, and was formed in 1985 by a group of students who were members of Imperial College Radio. The intention was to make sure that when people left the hallowed halls of Imperial College, that there was an easy way for them to keep in touch with each other, meet up now and then, and generally keep the fire burning. Further to this, Reggie was set up as the club's official annual handbook, to publicise events, circulate the membership address list and provide an airing for the members many views and opinions.

He played in the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Continental Basketball Association, the USBL and the IBL, and abroad in Puerto Rico and Argentina. Smith was raised in a foster home, called Lydia Children's Home, as a ward of the state of Illinois due to neglect from his parents when he was five years old. Smith was selected out of Chicago's Martin Luther King High School (where he averaged 25.5 points and 14.5 rebounds per game in his senior year) by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round (29th overall) of the 1999 NBA Draft, and was immediately traded to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for the draft rights to Gordan Giriƒçek and a second-round pick in the 2000 NBA Draft. However, in subsequent months he suffered numerous psychological concerns, and was released in February 2000 without ever playing a game for the Mavericks. A month previous, Smith was released from a psychiatric ward to where he was committed for several weeks, after an incident in which he threw a rock through a car window and swallowed approximately 250 aspirin tablets and would tell police officers, \\"I am an Indian fighting Columbus\\". In January 2002, Smith was signed by the Atlanta Hawks for whom he played 14 games. His short stint with the Hawks involved being waived, signed back a second time, and eventually being traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, for whom he never played. Late in the 2003‚Äì04 NBA season, the Seattle SuperSonics signed Smith to a contract, but he only played one game for them.

His maternal grandfather was the Scottish politician Charles Ritchie, 1st Baron Ritchie of Dundee. Following his father, he was educated at Beaumont College and Oriel College, Oxford, where he took a Third in Jurisprudence. He was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1931.

Wounded in action, he was mentioned in dispatches and received the French Croix de Guerre. Returning to the bar after the war, he took silk in 1948 at the age of forty, like his father and grandfather. He was Attorney General of the Duchy of Cornwall from 1951 to 1960. A leading Chancery counsel, he was appointed to the Chancery Division of the High Court in 1960, receiving the customary knighthood. He was promoted Lord Justice of Appeal in 1962, and was sworn of the Privy Council. In 1960 he pleaded guilty to a charge of drunk driving, which was thought to have delayed his promotion. Nevertheless, on 30 September 1975, he was appointed Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was made a life peer with the title Baron Russell of Killowen, of Killowen in the County Down, the same title that his grandfather and father had held.

First awarded in 1911 to Glenn H. Curtiss for his successful development of the hydro-aeroplane. Collier presented his namesake trophy several times before his death in 1918; after his World War I service. In 1922, when the Aero Club dissolved, the award was taken over by the National Aeronautic Association (NAA) and it was unofficially renamed the Robert J. Collier Trophy, which became official in 1944. The award is presented once a year by the NAA president for \\"the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in America, with respect to improving the performance, efficiency, and safety of air or space vehicles, the value of which has been thoroughly demonstrated by actual use during the preceding year.\\" The trophy is permanently displayed at the U.S. National Air and Space Museum.

Starting with fellow sophomores Lucas and Havlicek, Nowell's shooting was a key element in Ohio State's run to the 1960 NCAA title. He was named to the 1960 All-Tournament Team. Ohio State's 1960‚Äì61 team went undefeated until the NCAA Final. Ohio State's 1961‚Äì62 also reached the NCAA Final. Nowell did participate in the 1960 US Olympic Trials but was never seriously considered for a spot on the team. Only three blacks were named to that team, and more attention was paid to Nowell's white Ohio State teammates, a factor he considered in his remaining basketball career. Nowell's shooting ability was such that he could have been a big scorer at another school, a fact that could have led to a bigger pro career. Instead, he played with or for four future Hall of Famers, went to three straight NCAA Finals, winning one in 1960. All three years, the Ohio State Buckeyes were undefeated at home at St. John Arena.

One of Sweden's most well-known restaurants, it is the second oldest restaurant in the world to have the same surroundings, according to the Guinness World Records. Its surroundings and environment are more or less unchanged since the day the restaurant opened in 1722, making it a unique example of an 18th- century tavern. Throughout the centuries, Freden has been a central gathering place for many of Sweden's noted writers, painters and songwriters; most significantly, Anders Zorn bought Freden in 1919 and saved it from shutting down. The house in which Freden is located is now owned and so secured for the future by the Swedish Academy. Every Thursday, the Academy (which nominate the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature) convenes here for its weekly dinner.

The school opened in 1938 and is named for the Feast of the Epiphany.  Quick Facts  * 94% of the students are baptized Roman Catholics * Over 80% of the students are members of Parish- registered families. (Note: Of the registered families, only 74% have chosen to act as ‚ÄúParticipating Families‚Äù) * 77% of the students come from the immediate area * 67% of the students are Filipino; 23% are Latino; and 10% are other * 50% of the students are male, and 50% are female * 71% of the students come from families that speak a variety of languages in addition to, or instead of, English * 92% of the students come from families with at least one computer (of which 88% have internet access). Facilities The original building, built in 1938, houses the K ‚Äì 8th grade classrooms (two classrooms per grade, with 30‚Äì37 students per classroom), the faculty room, the portable Mac lab, the music room (previously a convent), a cafeteria where hot lunch is served Tuesday through Friday, several bathrooms, and offices for the learning specialist, principal & vice principal (currently connecting offices), counselor, nurse, and main activity. The halls are decorated with much student work. On the first floor is the awards wall, with \\"Student of the Month\\" and various other awards won by the students. The newer building, christened Nano Nagle Hall after the foundress of the Presentation Sisters, was built in 2003. The hall houses athletics awards, a gymnasium, a library, the vending machine room (with two vending machines that are off-limits to students during school hours), and both eighth grade classrooms, one of which is a science lab. Each classroom has at least Three Apple computers that students use for research. The sixth grade lockers are located in their classrooms, while the seventh and eighth grade students have lockers in the hallways of their classrooms. Communication The school sends out a Wednesday envelope every first and last Wednesdays of the month. In it is the newsletter (the Epiphany Times) and various flyers regarding upcoming events for the school. Each teacher has an e-mail address with the school's server and phone extension; most middle school teachers prefer e-mail as a means of communication, for they are supplied with Apple laptops each year. All students have online access to their progress reports (when the teachers have updated them) and classroom calendars, which informs one about daily assignments and upcoming tests. Student life There are about 300 students. Students start school 8:00 am everyday and school ends at 3:00-3:15 p.m. Before classes start there is a morning prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance which the students recite. Daily Schedule Epiphany starts every school day at 8:00 a.m.. On Mondays, students are let out at 12:35 p.m.; on every other day, classes are dismissed at 3:00-3:15 p.m. Church is attended daily by a class. Four days a week students fill in their day with one of the four following classes: Physical Education, Makerspace, Art, or Spanish. Athletics The sports teams, known as the Eagles, compete in CYO, PAL, and FLAME. There are over 20 teams total for boys and girls at Epiphany. The sports offered at Epiphany include basketball for both boys and girls, along with baseball for boys and volleyball for girls. The sports run fall-winter and winter-spring seasons, the latter being significantly longer. Curriculum The school offers many subjects that get progressively harder each year. Every grade takes math, language arts, religion, science, history, and P.E. In 2000, the school began offering Spanish, as a result of a schoolwide survey on their preference for a language course. Spanish is a class taken Tuesdays to Fridays for grades K to 8. Exploratories & Advisory Epiphany offers a program called Exploratories (similar to high school electives) to the middle school students. Exploratories take place on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons for a grading quarter or semester, depending on the Exploratory. Students make a list of preferences in the last months of fifth, sixth, and seventh grades. Quarter-long Exploratories include Karate, First Aid & CPR, badminton, and Semester-long exploratories include Drama and handbells. In addition, qualified students in all three years of middle school are chosen for the school's Junior High Academic Decathlon team, which takes place of their first semester Exploratory. All middle school students are placed in an advisory with several other of their classmates and a teacher. This is their group for all of middle school; students sign agreements to not reveal anything said in their advisory outside of the advisory time. Generally, advisory activities are team-building and discussion ‚Äì if no activity is given, the period becomes a study hall. Connection to the parish While most, if not all, current teachers are lay men and women, Catholicism plays a huge role in defining this community. Epiphany's students and teachers regularly attend Mass. Catholic baptized students have their first Holy Communion and Reconciliation in the 2nd grade, along with other students from the parish. Eighth grade students who have received all three of the aforementioned sacraments are then eligible to participate in the sacrament of Confirmation. Students are not required to take these sacraments to pass; however, students are required to take Religion (study of Catholicism) as a class. Starting in the third grade, classes attend 8 AM mass on a specific day, according to grade. Starting at the end of fifth grade, students are invited to become altar servers for the church. The school choir, also known as the Songleaders, include a range of students from the third to eighth grades; the Songleaders sing at school Masses and various church gatherings. Arts All students study music to some extent. Basic instrumental lessons are given to grades 4 ‚Äì 6 (the recorder), and optionally for 7 & 8 (the handbell Exploratory). Extra piano lessons are offered after school once a week for grades K ‚Äì 6 (there is a piano in two classrooms, excluding the music room). Everyone is mandated to sing at the school's annual winter caroling concert. Each year there is an art fair when students display their visual artwork. Other The junior high also takes part in associations such as NJHS and CJSF. All students are encouraged to participate in the school spelling bee, geography bee, and science faire, and students regularly win awards in these competitions. The school also has an active Parents Association. The school has a READ program where, every month, students in all grades turn in their READ folders for prizes ranging from a little trinket to a free ice cream pass. Epiphany has an Extended Care program after hours until 6 PM. During this time, students who are signed up for Homework Club (mostly remedial students) get help with their schoolwork from a junior high student in CJSF or NJHS.

Origins  Lieutenant Edward Close, an engineer and founder of Morpeth, recorded that part of the Wallsend area was called Barrahinebin by the Aboriginal custodians. Close reported that Barrahinebin was used to describe the area bounded by the Hunter River, Ironbark Creek and Mount Sugarloaf. Wallsend was named after a North of England coal mining township, initially built at the end of a Roman defensive wall, a suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne. The name was given to the area by Alexander Brown in the 1850s when he purchased land bounded by what are now Newcastle Road, Boundary and Croudace Streets and beyond Gunambi Road. The company he formed to operate the colliery which opened in January 1861 was called the Newcastle-Wallsend Coal Company.Norm Barney, \\"Growth Driven By Rich Coal Deposit\\", Newcastle Herald (supplement) 11 Nov 1997 page 7.Hunter Valley Place Names and their Meanings The suburb began as two mining towns, Wallsend and Plattsburg.

Watts, 21 January 1937 ‚Äì 3 June 2017) was an Australian rules football player and radio broadcaster and television personality. Early life John Watts was born on 21 January 1937 in East Perth, Western Australia to Western Australia Police Superintendent James Albert Watts and Eileen Sylvia Watts. He grew up in the Maylands area and attended Maylands State School (along with Graham Farmer). After graduating from school, he went to work as an apprentice carpenter and joiner, later gaining a trade qualification in his mid-teenage years. Upon reaching minimum recruitment age, John Watts joined the Western Australia Police (Police number: 2998) after successfully graduating from the WA Police Academy. John would serve in the Western Australia Police (while playing professional league football with East Perth Football Club) alongside many family members including his Father, Uncles and cousins. To date, the Watts family remains one of longest and largest serving Police families in Australia. John resigned from the Western Australia Police when he moved to Geelong, Victoria to play for the Geelong Football Club.  Football career  The three major Football Clubs J.K. Watts played for. John Watts' love of Australian rules football came at a young age when he would take the tram with his grandfather to Perth Oval to see East Perth Football Club play. With his dream of one day playing league football with his favourite club firmly in his mind, he signed up to play with the Bayswater Junior Football Club. It was during these years he worked on developing his skills as a footballer to be selected at the professional level. He was soon noticed and at a young age was selected to play in the Junior Reserves for his beloved East Perth Football Club. To his football credit, after only playing a few reserves matches, Watts debuted for the East Perth Football Club on a half back flank against Subiaco at the age of 17 in 1954 and would become a regular player with the club. Under Coach Jack Sheedy's guidance East Perth Football Club quickly became the outstanding side in the competition. East Perth made the Grand Final and won in 1956, 1958 and 1959, with John K Watts as Full Back in every one of these Premiership Teams along with Graham \\"Polly\\" Farmer. John Watts ended up playing 166 games as East Perth's primary fullback from 1954-1962. After the 1962 season had finished with East Perth Football Club, John received many good offers from the then Victorian Football League (now Australian Football League) clubs of St Kilda, Essendon, and Geelong. Initially, John wanted to and was nearly selected to play for Essendon, but instead decided to follow his friend Graham Farmer to the Geelong Football Club. He went on to play for Geelong Football Club from 1963 until 1965 including their 1963 Premiership win over the Hawthorn Football Club. A Premiership win that Geelong Football Club would not win again until 44 years later in 2007. Although footage of John Watts' single-handed mark in the 3rd quarter of the Premiership match became the signature piece of footage from the 1963 Grand Final at the time, it was the club theme song that he penned for the Club to use if they won (which they did) that would become his lasting legacy. The club theme song is still played today at all games won and Premiership wins with Watts' original lyrics. In 1966, Watts moved to Tasmania to Captain/Coach the Hobart Football Club. In his first year in this role he led them to a premiership. This success would make him the only Australian rules football player to have played in three premiership sides, for three different teams, in three different states. He retired from playing football in 1968. Although a highly respected player, he is possibly best remembered for his off-field antics, and could be described as the epitome of a \\"club man\\". He was always found at all the club's social events entertaining everyone with his stand up routine or \\"belting\\" out a tune on the piano. Both these qualities would prove beneficial in his later career. It was during these events that he wrote several club anthems. He wrote the East Perth Football Club, Swan Districts and Geelong Football Club theme songs.> In March 2008 he was inducted into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame.  Media career  After leaving football, Watts went on to have a successful career in radio and television. Over 30 years he worked for various television and radio stations and was a popular comedian. John wrote most of his own material and would go on to write jokes for famous comedians such as Bob Hope and Harry Secombe and published magazines and joke books.John K. Watts and Bob Hope Watts appeared on TVW 7's first televised Football Panel and World of Sport segments (hosted by Ross Elliott) for many years. He would also present the Football and Sports review on Channel 7 News and was a regular entertainer and panelist on TVW 7's Telethon. He also contributed articles to various Perth Newspapers on Sport and would also \\"ghost write\\" several sport-related articles. He was also a popular commentator for Football matches both on radio and television. Dynamic Duo  The \\"Dynamic Duo\\" Wattsie and Martin During the early 1970s, John Watts was approached by George Chapman (then head of Perth Radio Station 6PM) to form a variety style radio program. The proposal was to team up with popular DJ and talented radio producer Barry Martin to create this new style of show. It was originally slotted in the morning hours as a trial and would not disrupt the popular and highly rated afternoon and early evening programs. At this time, the morning slots were considered unpopular by radio announcers and it was therefore relatively easy for Watts and Martin to have unrivalled \\"air-time\\" during these hours. Unknowingly and with no intention of doing so, Watts and Martin had created one of the first \\"Breakfast Shows\\". It proved to be a hit with the public and within only six months, most people were waking up to the \\"Watts and Martin Breakfast Show\\" and the ratings reflected their instant popularity. By the late Seventies they became known as the Dynamic Duo and were a popular and familiar face in Australian broadcasting. They became both famous and infamous with their larrikin type antics and special brand of humour. Such instances of calling the State Premier early on a Wednesday morning to talk about Football or \\"giving away free tickets to sail on the Queen's Yacht up the Swan River\\" when she visited, became part of broadcasting comedic history. They helped welcome in Qantas Airways' first B747 into Perth, the Australind Train Service to Bunbury and the renewed Indian Pacific Train Service (to which John Watts penned another song). Eventually as ratings soared, the late Kerry Packer asked John and Barry to come and work for him. They were allowed more commercial freedom and had access to the latest equipment and studios. It was during this time that they were at the height of their success in the early 1980s and they ended up becoming the only Breakfast Radio Program in Australia to ever hold more than 50% of the population in ratings. This record still stands today. Jonathan Livingston Seagull, 1973 Although politically incorrect and often controversial for its time, Watts always maintained that it \\"was all in good fun\\". His jokes often pointed fun at other sporting codes, politicians, other footballers (see Mal Brown) and himself. He has been regarded by many as the forerunner to modern Football Panel and Breakfast Radio style programs and most of his methods are still widely used today that he developed when television was in its formative years. Business career Watts later went on to actually own several of Perth's top radio stations and hotels. He ended up becoming a very successful businessman in Western Australia with interests in many football, horse-racing and hotel ventures. At one stage during this time, he came up with the idea of integrating a West Australian team into the then Victorian Football League. Initially, Watts wanted to use East Perth Football Club as it already had the support base and infrastructure, but this idea was later boycotted by rivals in the then- West Australian Football League. Watts managed to get together several prominent businessmen including Lindsay Fox and Alan Delaney to put forward the idea. This proposal would later become the West Coast Eagles. The only current reference to Watts' involvement in the creation of the West Coast Eagles is in fellow footballer and friend John Todd's biography. Personal life John Watts has three daughters (Joanna, Donna who was tragically killed in 1995 and Vanessa) and two sons (Luke and Jonathon) and six grandchildren. He is married to Lorraine and resides in the coastal city of Scarborough in Western Australia over-looking the Indian Ocean. In November 2011, he was diagnosed with a form of bone cancer, after previously having a malignant melanoma removed from the back of his neck during his football players days and prostate cancer in 2000.

Peace be upon the male), is a gathering which takes place in Ashkenazi Jewish circles on the first Friday night after a baby boy is born. Although intended to \\"console\\" the newborn, the get-together is treated as a happy occasion. Sources The source for this practice is the ruling of the Rema in the Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 265:12: > It is customary to make a festive meal on the Friday night after the birth > of a baby boy. People go to the house where the baby is, to taste something > [there], and this [eating] is also [considered] a seudat mitzvah. The Taz, a major commentator on the Rema, finds the source for the Rema's statement in the Talmudic tractate of Niddah (30b). Here the Talmud states that while a baby develops within the womb, \\"he is taught the entire Torah. However, as soon as he enters the air of this world, an angel comes and strikes him on his mouth, causing him to forget the entire Torah\\" (Taz, Yoreh Deah 265:13). Because the baby forgot all the Torah he learned, he is likened to a mourner. Just as people visit a mourner in his home to comfort him during the mourning period, people visit the home of the newborn to console him for the Torah he has forgotten. Rabbi Yaakov Emden writes that this meal is called a Seudat Zachar (Meal of Remembrance), and is held specifically on Shabbat because that day is also connected with remembrance, as the Torah states, \\"Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it\\" (Exodus 20:8). The Terumat HaDeshen (269) and the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch ( 163:8) consider the Shalom Zachar a Seudat mitzvah. Customs In current practice, the Shalom Zachar is an informal, drop-in gathering which takes place after the Friday night meal. The location of the gathering is determined by where the father of the new baby spends Shabbat, since he presides over the event. Thus, a Shalom Zachar usually takes place in the home of the newborn (even if the newborn is still in the hospital), although it may also take place at the home of grandparents, in-laws, or even friends with whom the father is spending Shabbat. Typically, mainly men and boys drop by to convey their congratulations, to have a bite to eat, to share words of Torah, and to sing songs welcoming the newborn and thanking God for the birth. If the mother is already back home with the baby, female relatives or friends will usually drop by to visit her as well. Typical light refreshments include cake, cookies, popcorn, pretzels, nuts and seeds, soft drinks, and beer. In addition, chickpeas are customarily served because they are a round-shaped food eaten by mourners (as they symbolize the cyclical nature of life). Beer is served as it is cheap and most can afford to buy it. A Shalom Zachar is not held when this Friday night coincides with the night of Yom Kippur or the night of the Passover Seder. Yom Kippur is a fast day, and therefore all eating and drinking is forbidden. On the night of the Passover Seder, it is forbidden to eat anything after eating the afikomen, which is eaten at the end of the meal. If the Shalom Zachar falls on a Friday night during any other day of Passover, matzah cakes and potato-flour cookies will be served instead of regular flour cakes and cookies. Brit Yitzchak Sephardic Jews do not hold a Shalom Zachar. Instead, their custom is to conduct a gathering called a Brit Yitzchak on the evening preceding the newborn boy's brit milah.

He played his entire professional career with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was selected in the 18th round (248th overall) by the Detroit Lions in the 1962 NFL Draft. He played college football at Arizona State. College career Zuger attended Arizona State University, between 1959 and 1961, where he excelled on offence, defence and as a punter. As quarterback, he compiled a 24-7 record in three years as a starter. He also played defensive back and punter. During his senior season in 1961, Zuger completed 67-of-133 passes (50.4%) for 879 yards and eight touchdowns, and led the team and ranked among the nationally with 10 interceptions (the third best single-season mark in ASU history), and had a 42.1-yard punting average. He has been inducted into the Arizona State University Sports Hall of Fame. CFL playing career Drafted by the NFL's Detroit Lions in the 18th round (248th overall) Zuger came to Canada for what would be a ten-year career (1962 to 1971) with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. In 1962, his rookie season, Zuger shared quarterback duties with Frank Cosentino,http://www.cflapedia.com/Players/z/zuger_joe.htm as the #1 starter, Bernie Faloney, was injured.Who's Who in Canadian Sport, Volume 4, p.490, Bob Ferguson, Fitzhenry and Whiteside Ltd., Markham, ON and Allston, MA, Zuger turned heads immediately when in his very first game as the starting quarterback he threw for a team record 572 passing yards and a league record eight touchdown passes in a 67-21 win over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. That year, Zuger completed 55.7% of his 113 passes for 1,070 yards and had a 15-6 touchdown-to-interception ratio. In addition, he intercepted four passes as a defensive back and was the regular punter with a 43.3 yard average. With Faloney back in 1963, Zuger became a full-time defensive back and had five interceptions. Injuries limited Zuger to just eight games in 1964, and in 1965, with the trading of Faloney to Montreal, Zuger moved back to the quarterback position, sharing duties with Cosentino again, as well as in 1966, before taking over as the sole #1 quarterback in 1967 and leading Hamilton to victory in the 55th Grey Cup game against Saskatchewan, named as the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player. That year and 1968 were Zuger's best as quarterback, both with over 300 pass attempts and passing for 2,771 and 2,616 yards, respectively. Injuries cut Zuger back to 11 games in 1969 and nine in 1970. In his final season, in 1971, Zuger returned to play all 14 games, completing 48.6% of his 265 passes for 1,632 yards, but he had a bad 8-19 touchdown-to- interception ratio. Zuger, as a punter recorded a league record 45.5-yard punting average over his career. Three times, he averaged over 48 yards-per- punt over a season and had punts of over 80 yards at least four times, including one of 85 yards in 1968. He played in five Grey Cup games, winning three (1963, 1965, 1967). Post-playing CFL career Zuger would later serve in Hamilton's front office. In 1981, he was appointed as General Manager, a position he served for over a decade.

When generating a 3D volume the ultrasound data can be collected in four common ways. Freehand, which involves tilting the probe and capturing a series of ultrasound images and recording the transducer orientation for each slice. Mechanically, where the internal linear probe tilt is handled by a motor inside the probe. Using an endoprobe, which generates the volume by inserting a probe and then removing the transducer in a controlled manner. The fourth technology is the matrix array transducer that uses beamsteering to sample points throughout a pyramid shaped volume.  Risks  The general risks of ultrasound also apply to 3D Ultrasound. Essentially ultrasound is considered safe. While other imaging modalities use radioactive dye or ionizing radiation, for example, ultrasound transducers send pulses of high frequency sound into the body and then listen for the echo. In summary, the primary risks associated with ultrasound would be the potential heating of tissue or cavitation. The mechanisms by which tissue heating and cavitation are measured are through the standards called thermal index (TI) and mechanical index (MI). Even though the FDA outlines very safe values for maximum TI and MI it is still recommended to avoid unnecessary ultrasound imaging.  Applications   Obstetrics  3D US is useful among other things for facilitating the characterization of some congenital defects, such as skeletal anomalies and heart issues. With real-time 3D US the fetal heart-rate can be examined in real-time  Cardiology  The application of three-dimensional ultrasound in cardiac treatments has done outstanding progress in scanning and treating the heart issues. When the 3D ultrasound technology is used to visualize the cardiac state of an individual, it is called as 3D Echocardiography. With the integration of other technologies with the Ultrasound, it is now possible to track the quantitative measures like the chamber volume that occurs during the cardiac cycle. Also, it provides other useful information like tracking the blood flow, speed of contractions and expansions. With the 3D Echocardiography method doctors now can easily detect the artery diseases and can finely examine the various defects. The echo applications helps to give a real-time image of the cardiac structures.  Surgical guidance  Traditionally, with the 2D ultrasound, the specific position of organs and tissues useful in surgeries could not be located especially in the oblique plane. However, with the advent of 3D ultrasound, the imaging technique has evolved manifolds enabling the surgeons to get a real-time picture of the tissues and organs and visualize the complete scan more efficiently. In addition to this, 3D ultrasound provides surgical guidance in terms of treating transplant and cancer with its technique of rotational visualizing while scanning. This technology has evolved various methods like rotational scanning, slice projection, use of integrated array transducer that helps the surgeons to handle the traumatic cancer patients. Further, with 3D ultrasound doctors can now treat various kind of tumors as every tissue can be easily diagnosed and introspected to study the defects and cause. Thus, we see that the ultimate scanning and visualization done by 3D ultrasound has developed better ways of treating the patients with problems like cancer, tumors and transplants.  Vascular imaging  Blood vessels and arteries movements are not easy to track because of their distribution due to which capturing a real-time picture becomes difficult. Diagnosis is widely used in every kind of treatment and with the 3D US, it is now possible to track dynamic movement of blood cells, veins and arteries. In addition to this, various types of diagnosis like measuring the diameter, diagnosing the wall between the arteries can be detected with a magnetic tracker integrated with 3D US that helps in accurate positioning. So the technology gives imaging assistance and also has a sensor that helps in tracking the position of vessels in operations.  Regional anesthesia  Real-time three-dimensional ultrasound is used during peripheral nerve blockade procedures to identify relevant anatomy and monitor the spread of local anesthetic around the nerve. Peripheral nerve blockades prevent the transmission of pain signals from the site of injury to the brain without deep sedation, which makes them particularly useful for outpatient orthopedic procedures. Real-time 3D ultrasound allows muscles, nerves and vessels to be clearly identified while a needle or catheter is advanced under the skin. 3D ultrasound is able to view the needle regardless of the plane of the image, which is a substantial improvement over 2D ultrasound. Additionally, the image can be rotated or cropped in real time to reveal anatomical structures within a volume of tissue. Physicians at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville have been developing techniques using real time 3D ultrasound to guide peripheral nerve blocks for shoulder, knee, and ankle surgery.

History  The Singapore Cricket Club is said to have been one of the first rugby clubs in Singapore when employees from the British East India Company brought the game to Singapore. For many years in the 1800s and early 1900s the Singapore team that played against other Malayan states was made up of expatriates who were working in Singapore and army servicemen based in Singapore at the time. With such a large core of servicemen making the \\"national team\\" of the time, a Singapore \\"Civilians XV\\" also played many games representing the island state. Up to the 1960s, this representation of Singapore Civilians made up the national team that competed in the annual Malaya Cup that hosted states from around Malaya (now Malaysia). This was the forerunner to the modern day Agong Cup that is currently organised by the Malaysian Rugby Union. This side was made up predominantly of expatriates from the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. 1971 saw the birth of the Under-23 national team when it played against Malaysia in the Anchor Cup curtain raiser match to the England game. The Under-23 team was made up of all national local boys from the Armed forces, Police force, local clubs and schools. In 1972 the SRU under the presidency of ASP Niaz Mohd Shah from the Police Force decided to brave the challenge and form the new all citizens local national rugby team. The Singapore national team participated in the 3rd ARFUT (Asian Rugby Football Union Tournament) in Hong Kong and emerged a credible 4th position. Leow Kim Liat was the captain for the 1972 team, and became the first Asian to ever captain a Singapore representative side, and the first National Captain. In 1975, Singapore participated in SEAP (South East Asian Peninsular Games) held in Bangkok. However, Singapore lost to both Thailand and Malaysia and emerged 3rd with a bronze medal. In 1977 Singapore took part in the SEA Games held in Malaysia. Singapore bettered their 1975 performance by winning the silver medal after beating hosts Malaysia, but losing to Thailand in a rain sodden finals match. In 1978, Singapore Rugby achieved its best ever performance in history under coach Natahar Bava. The all citizens local Singapore national won a historic MRU Cup victory in the annual MRU (M'sian Rugby Union) tournament after 44 years of participation under the label of Singapore Civilians. The Singapore team beat the RNZIR (Royal New Zealand Infantry Battalion) in the semi-finals (which was actually the finals in the eyes of many rugby followers). They beat the RMAF Blackhawks in the MRU Cup final. Later that same year Singapore took part in the 6th Asian Rugby tournament held in Kuala Lumpur. They emerged with their best ever result to this day with a 3rd-place finish behind powerhouses, Japan and South Korea when they beat Thailand in a 16-15 3rd placing intriguing game. For their efforts and achievements SNOC awarded Singapore Rugby with the Sportsman of the Year 1978 award to Song Koon Poh, Coach of the year to Natahar Bava and the entire 1978 national team as Singapore's Sports Team of the year. The Singapore team went on to repeat another MRU Cup win under coach Natahar Bava in 1982, beating the Singapore-based Kiwis RNZIR Battalion in the finals. Singapore also excelled in rugby sevens game during this period. The team under Natahar Bava achieved their best ever 7s game results during 1978, 1979 and 1980 in the HK 7s tournament. Singapore's best ever rugby 7s results were in the 1978 Plate Finals where they lost to Bahrain 0-10 and in 1979 when they qualified for the top 8 teams Cup quarter finals losing out eventually to Western Samoa 4-16. In 1980 again Singapore lost in the Plate Finals to Japan by 0-40 in a flooded rain sodden game.  Rugby World Cup Qualifiers Singapore first tried to qualify for a World Cup for the 1995 tournament in South Africa, taking part in the Asia qualifiers. Singapore played out of Group B in Round 1, though they lost their three fixtures and did not advance to Round 2. Singapore attempted to qualify for the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales also; playing in Round 1 of Asia, but losing both of their fixtures against Sri Lanka and Thailand. Singapore finished second in the final standings of Pool A of Round 1 in attempting to qualify for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia, and did not advance to Round 2. They finished second in their group in qualification for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France as well, losing one match and winning one. Makeup of the National Team The current makeup of the National Team sees a mix of local born and bred Singaporean players and expatriates who fulfil World Rugby eligibility rules. The entirety of the team is based in Singapore, and are selected from all the Premiership clubs that play in the top division of the local league organised by the Singapore Rugby Union. While there has been past selection debates on an over reliance of expatriate players, the local development programme (National Rugby Academy) has seen success only at age group levels and hence see more local players through the ranks. Regrettably whilst development of the game has been successful at the schools level & in organizing international games & tournaments events here in Singapore in conjunction with the Tourism Board, we do not see the local rugby lads progressing strongly as an all citizens national rugby team as once evident back in the 1980s. Asian 5 Nations Competition Singapore have been competitors in the Asian 5 Nations competition since the inaugural 2008 tournament. In 2009 they competed in the premier division of the series. They kept the tournament winners Japan to a 30-point deficit, the smallest of any of Japan's games.

He has been active in Virgin Islands politics and the business community since returning to St. Thomas after graduating from college in 1981. De Jongh has been involved in community development, commercial banking, served on the boards of business and philanthropic organizations, appointed to government positions and elected to public office. De Jongh ran for governor in the 2002 general election as an independent candidate, placing second with 24.4% of the vote and losing to the incumbent, Charles W. Turnbull. In the 2006 general election de Jongh ran as the Democratic Party candidate and defeated former Lieutenant Governor Kenneth Mapp in a runoff and became governor. In 2010, he was re-elected to a second term and served until January 5, 2015, when he was term limited. Early life and education De Jongh was born and raised on St. Thomas. As a child, he attended Sts. Peter and Paul School on St. Thomas. After his parents' divorce, he lived with his mother, Dolores, and two brothers, Stanley and Sydney, in Detroit, Michigan, where his mother was a social worker for the Detroit Public Schools. During the summer, de Jongh would return to St. Thomas to assist in his father's law firm. De Jongh graduated from Detroit Catholic Central High School in 1976. After his graduation, he attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. During his college career, he held work-study jobs in Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia and St. Thomas and completed an urban study program that involved travel to the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia and The Netherlands. He earned an economics degree from Antioch College. De Jongh graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Antioch College in 1981. Business career After graduating from college, de Jongh returned to the Virgin Islands. He worked for several years with the Tri-Island Economic Development Council, during which he helped receive funding for the preservation of historic Virgin Island buildings, before taking a job with Chase Manhattan Bank. De Jongh first worked as an executive in the company's Puerto Rico office before returning to the Virgin Islands after earning the position of Consumer Manager of Operations in the U.S., British Virgin Islands and Saint Maarten. Under his leadership, Chase placed more emphasis on personal over corporate banking in the Caribbean and increased home mortgage lending. In 1987, de Jongh was appointed as Commissioner of Finance by Governor Alexander A. Farrelly, his first government position and one that had once been held by his grandfather, Percy de Jongh. In addition to his primary responsibilities for financial administration, de Jongh served as Chairman of the Governing Board of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority and as an Executive Director and board member of the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority. He was key in financial reforming and boosting the economy of the territory in the early 1990s. He also worked as an executive assistant to the governor's office, and he helped to coordinate better interagency cooperation. In 1992, he left government and returned to the private sector. That same year, de Jongh joined the real estate and insurance holding company, Lockhart Companies Incorporated where he served as President, CEO and a member of the board of directors until 2002. In 1993, he joined Public Financial Management, Inc., as a Senior Managing Consultant, where he helped to draft and implement Five-Year Plans for the cities of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New Haven, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C. From 1999-2001, de Jongh served as president of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce and headed a task force that created the Five Year Operating and Strategic Financial Plan for the government of the Virgin Islands, co-chaired a private-public sector group to negotiate with cruise lines and was selected as Rotary II's Person of the Year. In 2002, de Jongh left Lockhart Companies and unsuccessfully ran for governor as an independent candidate on a platform that addressed education, economic opportunity, crime, healthcare and financial management. De Jongh founded Chilmark Partners, a financial advisory firm focused on engagements in the Eastern Caribbean in 2003. Political career In 2005, it was reported that de Jongh led all potential candidates to become the next governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands when the incumbent vacated his seat the following year. In 2006, he ran as a Democrat and won the Democratic Party primary defeating Lieutenant Governor Vargrave Richards and Senator Adlah Donastorg with 52.2% of the votes. He won the governorship in 2006 after defeating former Lieutenant Governor Mapp in a November 21 run-off election with over 57% of the vote. De Jongh was sworn in as the 7th elected Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands on January 1, 2007. His administration focused on addressing early childhood education issues, established the Children and Families Council, sought partnerships with cruise lines, airlines and rum companies, championed economic diversification and implemented revitalization projects for the islands that comprise the U.S. Virgin Islands. De Jongh also created programs to reduce the territory's dependence on fossil fuels. After announcing they would seek a second term in office, de Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis won the Democratic primary election on September 11, 2010, after receiving 53% of the vote in the primary, more than all three of their Democratic challengers combined. De Jongh faced independent candidate Mapp, a former Lt. Governor, in the general election on November 2, 2010. The contest between de Jongh and Mapp was essentially a rematch of the top two contenders from the 2006 gubernatorial election. On November 2, 2010, De Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis were re-elected to second term, taking 17,535 votes, or 56.27%. De Jongh defeated the independent gubernatorial ticket of Mapp and Malik Sekou, who came in second with 13,580 votes. After reaching his term limit, de Jongh left office on January 5, 2015. During his second term, his administration focused on the completion of the \\"middle mile\\" fiber optic network, implemented Medicaid expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act, and oversaw the impact of the closure of Hovensa, LLC and its oil refinery on the island of St. Croix. Post gubernatorial In August 2015, de Jongh and Julito Francis, former director of finance of the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority, were charged with embezzlement and neglecting to pay public monies relating to the alleged conversion of Virgin Islands public to fund security improvements to the former governor's private residence. In January 2016, V.I. Superior Court Senior Sitting Judge Darryl Donohue dismissed the charges against de Jongh. In December 2016, de Jongh was appointed to the board of directors at Altisource Asset Management Corporation. De Jongh also serves as Principal of Chilmark Investment Partners, LLC. Personal life De Jongh has been married to Cecile Ren√© Galiber since 1986. The couple have three children. References .

Santa Caterina a Formiello is a church in Naples, in southern Italy, located at the extreme eastern end of the old historic center of the city, on Via Carbonara and Piazza Enrico de Nicola, near the gate called Porta Capuana. The term Formiello comes from the forms or containers for water spouts found in the convent. Diagonally across the street and South is the Fontana del Formiello against the rear wall of the imposing Castel Capuano. History Construction of the church began about 1510, designed by the Florentine Antonio della Cava, and completed in 1593. The church was one of the first domes in Naples,A New Guide of Naples, Its Environs, Procida, Ischia and Capri, by Giovanni Battista de Ferrari, (Naples, 1826) page 310 and was dedicated to the virgin and martyred Saint of Alexandria. It was attached to an ancient convent originally linked to the Celestine order and which passed to the Dominican fathers after 1498. The convent hosted Dominicans until the 19th century, when it was expropriated, and ultimately became used as a wool factory. The church has a single-aisle Latin cross interior covered by a barrel vault with five chapels on either side. The Roman Mannerist painter, Luigi Garzi, painted the large picture on the counterfacade. He also painted the triangles above the arches of the chapels, the corbels of the dome, and the great vault of the nave. The dome was painted by Paolo de Matteis. The ceilings of the chapels have frescoes by Guglielmo Borremans; the choir decorations and painting were by Gaetano Brandi. The main altar was commissioned by the Spinelli family of Cariati, to whom also belong the tombs that encircle it. The funereal monuments were completed by Scilla and Giannotto, two Milanese sculptors. On the wall, beside the altar is a Virgin with St Thomas Acquinas by Francesco Curia. A chapel on the other side has a canvas of St Dominic defeats the Albigensian Heretics by Giacomo del Po: the statues are by Columbo Napolitano.Luigi d' Afflitto, page 121. In the first chapel, all the paintings dedicated to St Catherine of Alessandria are by Giacomo del Po, the Visitation was painted by Garzi. In the next chapel, the chapel of St James, are collected the remains of 240 Martyrs of Otranto, that Alfonso II of Aragon had moved to Naples in 1574. The canvas of the Epiphany was painted by Silvestro Buono, and the Circumcision was completed by Paolo de Matteis. The Conversion of St. Paul was painted by Marco da Siena.

Life √ì Conaire was born in the Lobster Pot public house on the New DocksBirth certificate. in Galway on 28 February 1882. His father was a publican, who owned two premises in the town. His mother was Kate McDonagh. He was orphaned by the age of eleven. He spent a period living with his uncle in Garaffin, Ros Muc, Connemara. The area is in the Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking area) and √ì Conaire learned to speak Irish fluently. He emigrated to London in 1899 where he got a job with the Board of Education. He became involved in the work of the Gaelic League. A pioneer in the Gaelic revival in the last century, √ì Conaire and Patrick Pearse are regarded as being the two most important Irish language short story writers during the first decades of the 20th century. He was married to Molly N√≠ Mhanais, with whom he had four children: Eileen (born 22 February 1905), Patrick (born 3 November 1906), Kathleen (born 24 February 1909, and Mary Josephine (28 July 1911 ‚Äì 1922) who died of diphtheria. √ì Conaire returned to Ireland in 1914, leaving his family in London. Living mostly in Galway, he earned a meagre living through writing, teaching at Gaeltacht summer schools, and as an occasional organiser for the Gaelic League. He died on a visit to Dublin in 1928 after complaining of internal pains while at the head office of the Gaelic League. He was 46. His fellow poet Frederick Robert Higgins wrote a celebrated Lament for P√°draic √ì Conaire. He has family still living to this day in England as well as in Galway and Canada.

The fictitious character Masal Bugduv was created, the name sounds just like the Gaelic pronunciation of M'asal Beag Dubh. Journalists who didn't fact check quite as thoroughly as they should have missed the satire and told the world of the up- and-coming Moldovan star.  Statue  A statue of √ì Conaire's was unveiled in 1935 by √âamon de Valera in Eyre Square in the heart of Galway City. It was popular with tourists until it was decapitated by four men in 1999.

Vehicle breakdowns have various causes. Depending on the nature of the problem, the vehicle may or may not need to be towed to an automobile repair shop. A \\"breakdown\\" is also referred to when a car stalls on the road. A vehicle stalls for a number of reasons ranging from a dead car battery, fuel pump, poor quality fuel, faulty electrical wiring, fuel pressure problems, overlooked leaks or missing caps. Levels of breakdown There are various levels of a vehicle's disability. Total breakdown A total breakdown is when the vehicle becomes totally immobile and cannot be driven even a short distance to reach a repair shop, thereby necessitating a tow. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including complete engine failure, or a dead starter or battery, though a dead battery may be able to be temporarily resolved with a jump start. When a total breakdown occurs, the motorist may be able to have the service paid for by a roadside assistance plan. This may be available through an organization like AAA, the vehicle's manufacturer, the vehicle insurance policy, or in some cases, another service the driver subscribes to, such as a mobile phone Partial breakdown In a partial breakdown, the vehicle may still be operable, but its operation may become more limited or more dangerous, or else its continued operation may contribute to further damage to the vehicle. Often, when this occurs, it may be possible to drive the vehicle to a garage, thereby avoiding a tow. Some common causes of a partial breakdown include overheating, brake failure, or frequent stalling. The top ten causes of car breakdowns in 2014 In 2014, The Royal Automobile Club (RAC) attended almost two million breakdowns in the United Kingdom. Battery problems were the most common cause of a car breakdown, accounting for more than 450,000 call-outs. The top ten causes of car breakdown were: * Battery * Wheel change * Fuel * Mechanical problems * Puncture (no spare) * Electrical problems * Charging electrical vehicles * Clutch * Ignition * Cooling, heating, ventilation and air conditioning With other problems, the driver may be able to operate the vehicle seemingly normally for some time, but the vehicle will need an eventual repair. These include grinding brakes, rough idle (often caused by the need for a tune-up), or poor shock absorption. Many vehicle owners with personal economic difficulty or a busy schedule may wait longer than they should get necessary repairs made to their vehicles, thereby increasing damage or else causing more danger.

Four years later, her father began working in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, so her family moved back to the Middle East and stayed there until she graduated from The American University in Cairo. Throughout those times, Maryem always had a taste for music and sang in every school production. Her parents were originally against the idea of Maryem becoming a singer, but after university, Maryem started pursuing her dream. She first performed with Toronto-based Arab band Hot D.A.M. and later sang in Arabic for her brother's compositions. Later, she went to Syria and Egypt to further her studies and gained recognition from the Canada Council. She began receiving calls to perform with different groups as well as for recording sessions for commercials and films. Eventually, Maryem started a music group called \\"Mernie!\\" with her husband, Ernie Tollar. The band is a 10 piece ensemble while she and her husband compose all of the music and everyone in the band come from different cultural backgrounds.

Salinity degrades land by an increase in soil salt concentration in the environment, watercourse or soil in unirrigated landscapes, being in excess of normal soil salt concentrations in dryland regions. Overview Salinity refers to the movement and concentration of salt in the landscape and its associated detriment to land and water resources; dryland salinity refers to salinity in unirrigated landscapes. Salinity processes extend from local to regional scales and are driven by imbalances in the water budget that result, primarily, from agriculturally driven landscape change. There are two types of salinity: Types of salinity There are two types of salinity. Primary salinity (natural salinity) and secondary salinity (induced salinity). (Nrm.qld.gov.au, 2013) Primary salinity naturally occurs in arid and saline environments such as salt lakes, marshes, pans and salt flats. Natural accumulation of salt in soils is an outcome from previous cycles of drainage, desiccation and sea winds. High levels of salt are often found in dry soils, more so than wet soils as it is diluted and washed through the soil profile. (Barry and Holwell et al., 2012). Secondary salinity is a direct result of human interaction with the land, during development, agriculture and irrigation. Certain land practices have led to changes in the natural structure of the biosphere resulting in excess salting of the land, waterways and soils; thus having detrimental effects on biodiversity and the lands' productivity. Salinity and water cycle Factors such as climate, features of landscape, soils, drainage, aspect and the effects of human activities; all impact on the severity and occurrence of dryland salinity. Dryland salinity effects human and natural resources, such as native vegetation and crops, animals, infrastructure, agricultural inputs, biodiversity, aquatic ecosystems and water supply quality in the environment. Understanding dryland salinity requires a look at the water cycle. Water enters the soil from precipitation ‚Äì this is called Infiltration; water may remain indefinitely within the spaces or pores between soil particles as soil moisture. Soil moisture may be lost to the surface or atmosphere directly, or through plant uptake ‚Äì this is called evapotranspiration. Soil moisture may also continue to move downward to join the groundwater‚Äîthis is called groundwater recharge. Recharge is most likely to occur when the amount of water that is available to the soil exceeds the soil‚Äôs capacity to store it (field capacity). Recharge may also occur by saturated flow when water bypasses the soil matrix as it moves to depth in macropores (e.g. root holes, fractures). Excessive recharge may raise the water table locally, or at a landscape scale. When brackish to saline groundwater intersects the ground surface and discharges, this is termed saline discharge. Areas of discharge are called saline seeps (when groundwater intersects the soil surface) or saline scalds (where water is lost by evaporation only). Groundwater discharge manifests in such problems as: reduced agricultural production, degradation of natural environment, reduced surface water quality, damage to infrastructure including roads, as well as soil erosion and denudation of land. Reasons for dryland salinity Dryland salinity is broadly the result of three processes: Groundwater recharge, Groundwater movement and Groundwater discharge. (Environment.nsw.gov.au, 2013) Groundwater recharge occurs naturally, being a key process in the development of salinity, however land clearing accelerates this development as the once present deep-rooted plants do not use excess runoff, and it now seeps past the roots zone to enter the groundwater system. (Environment.nsw.gov.au, 2013) Evapotranspiration is reduced, as vegetation is lost, resulting in an imbalance in groundwater recharge and discharge, causing the water table to rise. Capillary action brings salt to the surface initiating surface salt accumulation. (Barry and Holwell et al., 2012) Prevention and alleviation of dry land salinity is a simplistic concept in theory however complex in application. Ceasing the removal of deeply rooted vegetation in order to moderate unbalanced groundwater recharge and the replanting of deeply rooted vegetation such as Eucalyptus and salt tolerant species in regions where salinity is present, will start to alleviate the salt and ground water discharge problems. (Barry and Holwell et al., 2012) However establishing plants in salt laden areas is extremely difficult. Dryland salinity is a sign that the water balance of the nearby area of land or catchment has been altered. Clearing as little as 25% of a catchment can cause salinity to occur. In addition to adding extra recharge, salinity may also be caused if the aquifers discharge capacity has been exceeded. In many Australian landscapes, aquifer capacity may be several orders of magnitude below that of the altered recharge. Restoring the balance requires either the introduction of natural vegetation (e.g. mallee eucalyptus or perennial grasses), which intercepts and transpires most of the incoming rainfall; or by adapting agriculture to the increased area of shallow, saline groundwater. Management Role of soils Dryland salinity management often focuses on vegetation, yet it is the collective role of soils and vegetation that has an effect on the root cause of the problem, recharge. Soil health cannot be ignored as a valuable and extensive activity for the management of dryland salinity ‚Äì the multiple benefits of improving soil health are clear and can be motivated by the potential for local and regional economic and social gains. Soil is considered in two contexts when it comes to dryland salinity: Recharge and discharge. ;Soils in groundwater recharge areas Soils absorb and store water according to their water holding or field capacity and how dry they are to start with. In much of Victoria, under typical rainfall and natural vegetation cover, soils take on water during wet winters and dry out over summers as plants consume the water (Young & Young, 2001). The drier the soil when leading into winter, the more water can be stored that might otherwise leak to groundwater. To reduce recharge to levels that existed in pre-clearing conditions is generally infeasible in most agricultural landscapes. This is because there are too few profitable perennials that can replace crops or that can be adopted at the scale required. In most recharge areas that are at risk of future salinity, the goal is to minimise recharge. This can be done by planting wide-spaced trees (alley farming), areas of perennials on suitable soils, and by preventing soils from being left without a significant leaf area in winter and spring. In recharge areas remote from saline areas there is often little incentive for farmers to adopt low profit, low recharge systems. In addition, recharge is the source of fresh groundwater, and a trade off between consumptive use and salinity should be acknowledged. ;Soils in groundwater discharge areas The manifestation of dryland salinity is largely a problem of groundwater ‚Äì however the accumulation of salt within the soil and at the surface due to proximity to or saturation by saline groundwater causes changes to the soil‚Äôs chemistry, structure and stability, and the plant life that it supports. ;Managing soils for dryland salinity in catchments In discharge areas, salinity can be managed by establishing salt-tolerant plants or by engineering systems. Engineering systems include deep open drains, pumps, siphons and various forms of surface water management. Engineering system involve the obvious discharge of salt and water. While saline areas also discharge salt and water, the abundance and timing will be changed. In most Australian states, farmers would be advised to seek advice before using engineering systems. Establishing salt-tolerant plants can improve salt discharge rates and improve soil health. Improvements undertaken at a catchment scale bring many benefits, not the least of which is providing for increased agricultural and associated regional productivity ‚Äì using water for production that otherwise would contribute to an environmental problem.

Dildos can be made from a number of materials and shaped like an erect human penis. They are typically in length, about the average length of an erect penis, but some may be longer, and circumference is typically . Description and uses General A dildo is an object usually designed for sexual penetration of the vagina, mouth, or anus, and is usually solid and phallic in shape. Penis prosthetic aids, known as \\"extensions\\", are not considered dildos. Some include penis-shaped items clearly designed for vaginal penetration, even if they are not true approximations of a penis. Some people include devices designed for anal penetration (butt plugs), while others do not. People of all genders and sexual orientations often use these devices for masturbation or for other sexual activity. Materials Mahogany wood dildo Rubber dildos, usually incorporating a steel spring for stiffness, became available in the 1940s. This arrangement was unsatisfactory because of the potential for injury from cuts by the spring if the rubber cracked and came apart. Later, PVC dildos with a softer PVC filler became popular. Most of the inexpensive dildos sold in the 2000s are made this way. PVC and jelly-rubber toys are problematic because they contain unsafe phthalates, softeners added to many plastics that are also found in some jewelry, food containers, and other soft rubber toys. Phthalates are linked to health problems such as cancer and prenatal defects. Products made of PVC or jelly rubber cannot be sterilized. Manufacturers recommend using condoms with these toys if users share them. Silicone rubber dildos became popular in the 1990s. Initially expensive, the cost of silicone dildos has dropped over time. Silicone is resistant to accidental damage, non- porous, and can be sterilized easily, making silicone dildos more durable and sanitary than dildos made of other soft materials. Silicone dildos conduct vibration well, and can be used in combination with a vibrator. High-end, chrome plated steel dildos are also popular in the BDSM scene. Some users prefer them because of their hardness, firmness, durability, electrical conductance (see erotic electrostimulation), and low friction, especially when used with lubricant. Because they are heavy, they can be used to exercise vaginal PC muscles. A steel dildo may be warmed or cooled in water to elicit a range of temperature sensations. It may also retain the user's body heat. Its polished nonporous surface allows sterilization in boiling water or an autoclave. Glass and steel dildos have similar features. In most cases, glass toys are solid, and made of Pyrex or other types borosilicate glass (Schott- Duranglas and Simax), although their construction can vary depending on the manufacturer. Like steel, glass toys may be used to apply firmer pressure than silicone can to a female's G-spot (urethral sponge) or a male's prostate gland. Unlike other types of toys, glass sex toys can also be personalized with inscriptions. Cyberskin is a synthetic material that feels more like human skin. It is porous and cannot be sterilized. It often becomes sticky after washing (which can be remedied by a dusting of cornstarch) and is more delicate and more prone to rips and tears than silicone dildos. \\"Packing dildos\\", which are not designed for penetration, are often made of this material. Phallus-shaped vegetables and fruits, such as bananas or zucchini or other food items, such as hot dogs or other types of sausages, have been used as dildos. Any object of sufficient firmness and shape could be used as a dildo. Shape Acrylic dildo Conventionally, many dildos are shaped like a human penis with varying degrees of detail, while others are made to resemble the phallus of animals. Not all, however, are fashioned to reproduce the male anatomy meticulously, and dildos come in a wide variety of shapes. They may resemble figures, or simply be practical creations which stimulate more easily than conventional designs. In Japan, many dildos are created to resemble animals or cartoon characters, such as Hello Kitty, so that they may be sold as conventional toys, thus avoiding obscenity laws. Some dildos have textured surfaces to enhance sexual pleasure, and others have macrophallic dimensions including over a dozen inches long. Uses Most dildos are intended for vaginal or anal penetration and stimulation, for masturbation on oneself or by a sexual partner. Dildos have fetishistic value as well, and may be used in other ways, such as touching one's own or another's skin in various places, often during foreplay or as an act of dominance and submission. If of appropriate sizes, they can be used as gags, for oral penetration for a sort of artificial fellatio. Dildos, particularly specially designed ones, may be used to stimulate the G-spot area. A dildo designed for anal insertion and to remain in place is usually referred to as a butt plug. A dildo intended for repeated anal penetration (thrusting) is typically referred to as an anal dildo or simply \\"dildo\\". Anal dildos and butt plugs generally have a large base to avoid accidental complete insertion into the rectum, which may require medical removal. Some women use double-ended dildos, with different-sized shafts pointing in the same direction, for simultaneous vaginal and anal penetration, or for two partners to share a single dildo. In the latter case, the dildo acts as a sort of \\"see-saw,\\" where each partner takes an end and receives stimulation. Some dildos are designed to be worn in a harness, sometimes called a strap-on harness or strap-on dildo, or to be worn inside, sometimes with externally-attached vibrating devices. Strap-on dildos may be double-ended, meant to be worn by users who want to experience vaginal or anal penetration while also penetrating a partner. They may also be used for anally penetrating men. If a female penetrates a male, the act is known as pegging. Other types of dildos include those designed to be fitted to the face of one party, inflatable dildos, and dildos with suction cups attached to the base (sometimes referred to as a wall mount). Other types of harness mounts for dildos (besides strapping to the groin) include thigh mount, face mount, or furniture mounting straps. Recent social acceptance and popularity has resulted in the emergence of highly adorned dildos, which are often made of expensive materials and may be jewelled. Society and culture Etymology The etymology of the word dildo was long considered unclear,. but the third edition of the Oxford English Dictionary concluded in 2018 that the word originates in nonsense syllables common in early-modern popular ballads (not dissimilar to the still-familiar nursery rhyme phrase \\"hey diddle diddle\\"), which came to be used as a coy euphemism for dildos.\\"dildo, int. and n.1.\\", OED Online, 3rd edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018). Accessed 29 May 2019. The phrase \\"Dil Doul\\", referring to a man's penis, appears in the seventeenth-century folk ballad \\"The Maids Complaint for want of a Dil Doul\\". The song was among the many in the library of Samuel Pepys. Other theories that have previously circulated include that the word dildo originally referred to the phallus-shaped peg used to lock an oar in position on a dory (small boat). It would be inserted into a hole on the side of the boat, and is very similar in shape to the modern toy. The sex toy might take its name from this sailing tool, which also lends its name to the town of Dildo and the nearby Dildo Island in Newfoundland, Canada. Others suggest the word is a corruption of Italian diletto \\"delight\\".Dildo (under heading Sex Aids). (n.d.). In Encyclopedia.com. Retrieved from https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/sex-aids. According to the OED, one of the word's first appearances in English was in Thomas Nashe's The Choise of Valentines or the Merie Ballad of Nash his Dildo (c. 1593), in the sentence \\"Curse Eunuke dilldo, senceless, counterfet, Who sooth maie fill, but neuer can begett\\" ('curse dildo, that eunuch, lacking feelings, and counterfeit, who can certainly fill [a vagina], but can never beget [children]').  Terms in other languages  An olisbos (pl. olisboi) is a classical term for a dildo, from Greek , i.e. a dildo that was usually made of leather. A godemich√© is a dildo in the shape of a penis with scrotum. In some modern languages, the names for dildo can be more descriptive, creative or subtle‚Äînote, for instance, the Russian —Ñ–∞–ª–ª–æ–∏–º–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä (literally \\"phallic imitator\\"), Bengali , Hindi ', Spanish consolador \\"consoler\\" and Welsh cala goeg \\"fake penis\\". History Dildos in one form or another have existed widely in history. Artifacts from the Upper Paleolithic of a type called b√¢ton de commandement have been speculated to have been used for sexual purposes.Marshack, A. 1972 The Roots of Civilization McGraw-Hill New York: 333 Few archaeologists consider these items as sex toys, but archaeologist Timothy Taylor put it, \\"Looking at the size, shape, and‚Äîsome cases‚Äîexplicit symbolism of the ice age batons, it seems disingenuous to avoid the most obvious and straightforward interpretation. But it has been avoided.\\"Taylor, T. 1996. The Prehistory of Sex. New York: Bantam. p. 128.Paul L. Vasey, Intimate Sexual Relations in Prehistory: Lessons from the Japanese Macaques. World Archaeology, Vol. 29, No. 3, Intimate Relations (Feb., 1998), pp. 407-425 The first dildos were made of stone, tar, wood, bone, ivory, limestone, teeth, and other materials that could be shaped as penises and that were firm enough to be used as penetrative sex toys. Scientists believe that a 20-centimeter siltstone phallus from the Upper Palaeolithic period 30,000 years ago, found in Hohle Fels Cave near Ulm, Germany, may have been used as a dildo. Prehistoric double-headed dildos have been found which date anywhere from 13‚Äì19,000 years ago. Various paintings from ancient Egypt around 3000 BCE feature dildos being used in a variety of ways. In medieval times, a plant called the ‚Äúcantonese groin‚Äù was soaked in hot water to enlarge and harden for women to use as dildos. Dildo-like breadsticks, known as olisbokollikes (sing. olisbokollix), were known in Ancient Greece prior to the 5th century BC. In Italy during the 1400s, dildos were made of leather, wood, or stone.Huffington Post UK, The. (Year, Month Day). The History Of Female Sex Toys: From Early Dildos To Rampant Rabbits. Huffington Post UK. Retrieved from https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/02/10/history-female-sex-toys-dildos- rampant-rabbits_n_4760274.html Chinese women in the 15th century used dildos made of lacquered wood with textured surfaces, and were sometimes buried with them. Nashe's early-1590s work The Choise of Valentines mentions a dildo made from glass. Dildos also appeared in 17th and 18th century Japan, in shunga. In these erotic novels, women are shown enthusiastically buying dildos, some made out of water buffalo horns. Dildos were not just used for sexual pleasure. Examples from the Eurasia Ice Age (40,000-10,000 BCE) and Roman era are speculated to have been used for defloration rituals. This is not the only example of dildos being used for ritual ceremonies, as people in 4000 BCE Pakistan used them to worship the god Shiva. Many references to dildos exist in the historical and ethnographic literature. Haberlandt,Haberlandt, M. 1899. \\"Contr√§re Sexual-Erscheinungen bei der Neger-Bev√∂lkerung Zanzibars\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Ethnologie, 31: 668‚Äì670 for example, illustrates single and double-ended wooden dildos from late 19th century Zanzibar. With the invention of modern materials, making dildos of different shapes, sizes, colors and textures became more practical.  Ancient Greece  Red figure amphora attributed to the Flying-Angel Painter c. 490 BC; City of Paris Museum of Fine Arts Dildo being used by two women. Lithograph from De Figuris Veneris (1906) by √âdouard-Henri Avril Dildos may be seen in some examples of ancient Greek vase art. Some pieces show their use in group sex or in solitary female masturbation. One vessel, of about the sixth century BCE, depicts a scene in which a woman bends over to perform oral sex on a man, while another man is about to thrust a dildo into her anus. They are mentioned several times in Aristophanes' comedy of 411 BCE, Lysistrata. :LYSISTRATA :And so, girls, when fucking time comes‚Ä¶ not the faintest whiff of it anywhere, right? From the time those Milesians betrayed us, we can‚Äôt even find our eight-fingered leather dildos. At least they‚Äôd serve as a sort of flesh-replacement for our poor cunts‚Ä¶ So, then! Would you like me to find some mechanism by which we could end this war? Herodas' short comic play, Mime VI, written in the 3rd Century BCE, is about a woman called Metro, anxious to discover from a friend where she recently acquired a dildo. :METRO :I beg you, don't lie, :dear Corrioto: who was the man who stitched for you this bright red dildo? She eventually discovers the maker to be a man called Kerdon, who hides his trade by the front of being a cobbler, and leaves to seek him out. Metro and Kerdon are main characters in the next play in the sequence, Mime VII, when she visits his shop. Page duBois, a classicist and feminist theorist, suggests that dildos were present in Greek art because the ancient Greek male imagination found it difficult to conceive of sex taking place without penetration. Therefore, female masturbation or sex between women required an artificial phallus to be used. Greek dildos were often made out of leather stuffed with wool in order to give it varying degrees of thickness and firmness. They were often lubricated with olive oil, and used for sexual practice and other activities. The Greeks were also one of the first groups to use the term ‚Äútoy‚Äù in reference to a dildo.  Talmud  The Talmud's Avodah Zarah TractateAvodah Zarah 44 records the interpretation which Rav Yosef bar Hiyya gave to the Biblical reference of King Asa of Judah having \\"(...) deposed his grandmother Maakah from her position as Queen Mother, because she had made a repulsive image for the worship of Asherah. Asa cut it down and burned it in the Kidron Valley\\".1 Kings 15:13, 2 Chronicles 15:16 According to Rav Yosef, Maakah had installed \\"a kind of male organ\\" on her Asherah image \\"in order to fulfill her desire\\", and was \\"mating with it every day\\". Rav Yosef's words are quoted by Rashi in his own interpretation of 2 Chronicles 15:16. Whether or not Rav Yosef was right in attributing this practice to the Biblical Queen, his speaking of it indicates that Jews in 3rd Century Mesopotamia were familiar with such devices.  Early modern period  In the early 1590s, the English playwright Thomas Nashe wrote a poem known as The Choise of Valentines, Nashe's Dildo or The Merrie Ballad of Nashe his Dildo. This was not printed at the time, due to its obscenity but it was still widely circulated and made Nashe's name notorious. The poem describes a visit to a brothel by a man called \\"Tomalin\\"; he is searching for his sweetheart, Francis, who has become a prostitute. The only way he can see her is to hire her. However, she resorts to using a glass dildo as he finds himself unable to perform sexually to her satisfaction. Dildos are humorously mentioned in Act IV, scene iv of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. This play and Ben Jonson's play The Alchemist (1610) are typically cited as the first use of the word in publication (Nashe's Merrie Ballad was not published until 1899). John Wilmot, the seventeenth-century English libertine, published his poem Signor Dildo in 1673. During the Parliamentary session of that year, objections were raised to the proposed marriage of James, Duke of York, brother of the King and heir to the throne, to Mary of Modena, an Italian Catholic princess. An address was presented to King Charles on 3 November, foreseeing the dangerous consequences of marriage to a Catholic, and urging him to put a stop to any planned wedding '...to the unspeakable Joy and Comfort of all Your loyal Subjects.\\" Wilmot's response was Signior Dildo (You ladies all of merry England), a mock address anticipating the 'solid' advantages of a Catholic marriage, namely the wholesale importation of Italian dildos, to the unspeakable joy and comfort of all the ladies of England: :You ladies all of merry England :Who have been to kiss the Duchess's hand, :Pray, did you not lately observe in the show :A noble Italian called Signor Dildo? ... :A rabble of pricks who were welcomed before, :Now finding the porter denied them the door, :Maliciously waited his coming below :And inhumanly fell on Signor Dildo ... This ballad was subsequently added to by other authors, and became so popular that Signor became a term for a dildo. In the epilogue to The Mistaken Husband (1674), by John Dryden, an actress complains: :To act with young boys is loving without men. :What will not poor forsaken women try? :When man's not near, the Signior must supply. Signor Dildo was set to music by Michael Nyman for the 2004 biopic, The Libertine. Many other works of bawdy and satirical English literature of the period deal with the subject. Dildoides: A Burlesque Poem (London, 1706), attributed to Samuel Butler, is a mock lament to a collection of dildos that had been seized and publicly burnt by the authorities. Examples of anonymous works include The Bauble, a tale (London, 1721) and Monsieur Thing's Origin: or Seignor D---o's Adventures in London, (London, 1722).Wagner (1987), p.53 In 1746, Henry Fielding wrote The Female Husband: or the surprising history of Mrs Mary, alias Mr. George Hamilton, in which a woman posing as a man uses a dildo. This was a fictionalized account of the story of Mary Hamilton.Wagner (1987), p.54  20th century  Dildos are obliquely referred to in Saul Bellow's novel The Adventures of Augie March (1953): \\"....he had brought me along to a bachelor's stag where two naked acrobatic girls did stunts with false tools\\".Bellow, Saul The Adventures of Augie March New York: Penguin, 1953, 2001 . p. 252 A dildo called Steely Dan III from Yokohama appears in the William S. Burroughs novel The Naked Lunch (1959). The rock band Steely Dan took their name from it.  21st century  In 2017, dark web privacy researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis connected a vibrator (using reverse engineering) to Tor, the anonymity network, in a proof of concept demonstrating the applicability of privacy technology after the fact.  Legal and ethical issues  The possession and sale of dildos is illegal in some jurisdictions, such as India. Until recently, many southern states and some Great Plains states in the United States banned the sale of dildos completely, either directly or through laws regulating \\"obscene devices\\". In 2007, a federal appeals court upheld Alabama's law prohibiting the sale of sex toys.Rawls, Phillip. Court leaves Ala. sex toy ban intact , USA Today, Oct 1, 2007 The law, the Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1998, was also upheld by the Supreme Court of Alabama on September 11, 2009. There are even instances where dildos have been seized and burned at customs. In February 2008, a United States federal appeals court overturned a Texas statute banning the sales of dildos and other sexual toys, deeming such a statute as violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment on the right to privacy. The appeals court cited Lawrence v. Texas, where the Supreme Court of the United States in 2003 struck down bans on consensual sex between gay couples, as unconstitutionally aiming at \\"enforcing a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct.\\" Similar statutes have been struck down in Kansas and Colorado. Alabama is the only state where a law prohibiting the sale of sex toys remains on the books. Some Conservative Christians believe that the use of sex toys is immoral. The Southern Baptist preacher Dan Ireland has been an outspoken critic of such devices and has fought to ban them on religious and ethical grounds. Ireland led an effort to outlaw dildos and other sex toys in Alabama to \\"...protect the public against themselves.\\" Other Christian religious leaders such as Evangelical Lutheran Church of America pastor Heidi Johnson, who founded a student group on sexuality at Duke Divinity School, have a positive view of sex toys in Christian sexuality.

Robinson Vines Grapes & Wines pgs 159, 199 & 790 Mitchell Beazley 1986 History The Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques region where Gros Verdot is believed to have originated. While ampelographers once believed that Gros Verdot originated with Petit Verdot in the Gironde region, DNA testing in 2007 showed that the grape likely originated as a wild grapevine domesticated in the Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques region. The name Verdot stems from the French word vert meaning \\"green\\" and is thought to reference the acidic, unripe flavors that the grape can have if not given a long growing season to full ripen before harvest. The term Gros means \\"grand\\" or \\"large\\", however Gros Verdot actually has smaller berries than Petit Verdot. The earliest mention of Gros Verdot comes from a 1736 document detailing it as one of the grapes, along with Petit Verdot, that was growing in the Bordeaux wine region. In the 19th century, Gros Verdot was a prominent grape in the Queyries vineyard planted outside the city of Bordeaux on land that is now part of the Jardin botanique de la Bastide. New plantings of Gros Verdot were officially banned from the Gironde in 1946 and today it is not listed in the French government's official register of permitted grape varieties. Viticulture Gros Verdot is a productive and high yield grape variety that, similar to Petit Verdot, requires a long ripening period. Despite the name Gros Verdot, the vine actually produces clusters of smaller berries than Petit Verdot. Like many Vitis vinifera varieties, Gros Verdot is highly prone to phylloxera with the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century being partially responsible for the grape's near extinction in France. This is because Gros Verdot does not take well to the grafting process that binds the vine to American rootstock that is more tolerant to phylloxera. While viticultural advances have improved Gros Verdot's grafting tolerance it still only takes well to certain types of Vitis rupestris stocks.Lanigan & Edwards \\"KENNETH VOLK WINES \\" Accessed: March 23, 2013 Wine regions Despite having the name Gros Verdot, the grape actually produces berries smaller than Petit Verdot (pictured). Though there are some plantings of Gros Verdot in France, since its 1946 banning its numbers have dwindled to the point where the variety is nearly extinct in its homeland. Outside France there are limited plantings in California where it is often confused with Cabernet Pfeffer (a late 19th-century crossing of Cabernet Sauvignon and unknown Vitis vinifera vine). In 2007, a vineyard first planted in 1895 and now growing grapes for Kenneth Volk Vineyards in the Lime Kiln Valley sub region of the San Benito AVA was discovered to be planted with Gros Verdot instead of Cabernet Pfeffer as originally thought.Kenneth Volk Vineyards \\"2008 Pinot Noir Enz Vineyard\\" Accessed: March 23rd, 2013 Similar DNA testing revealed other California plantings of vines labelled as Trousseau/Bastardo to also be Gros Verdot.

For financial accounting purposes, accelerated depreciation is expected to be much more productive during its early years, so that depreciation expense will more accurately represent how much of an asset's usefulness is being used up each year. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation provides a way of deferring corporate income taxes by reducing taxable income in current years, in exchange for increased taxable income in future years. This is a valuable tax incentive that encourages businesses to purchase new assets. For financial reporting purposes, the two most popular methods of accelerated depreciation are the double declining balance method and the sum-of-the-years‚Äô digits method. For tax purposes, the allowable methods of accelerated depreciation depend on the tax law that the taxpayer is subject to. In the United States, the two currently allowable depreciation methods for tax purposes are both accelerated depreciation methods (ACRS and MACRS). Background Companies in many countries pay taxes on profits: revenues minus expenses. There are various types of expenses, including salaries paid to workers, cost of inputs, and amortization and depreciation. Profits for tax purposes will, in most countries, differ from accounting profits or earnings. Under both financial accounting and tax accounting, companies are not allowed to claim the entire cost of a capital asset (any asset which can be used for many years) as an expense immediately. They must amortize the cost of the asset over some period, usually an approximation of the useful life of the asset. The depreciation basis is the cost incurred by the company in acquiring the asset. The useful life of the asset is determined by looking at Section 168(e)(3) of the United States Tax Code, and is known as the class life of the property. An example would be that a railroad track has a useful life of 7 years. This is not the end of the analysis however, because then it becomes necessary to look at the applicable recovery period of the property. The applicable recovery period determines the number of years over which the property should be depreciated. Section 168(e)(1) provides a table for determining the applicable recovery period. Following our 7 year railroad track, the table states that property with a useful life of more than 4 years but less than 10 years will be treated as 5 year property. Finally, it is important to determine the applicable convention for depreciation. Section 168(d)(4) of the U.S. Tax Code gives three different types: half year convention, the mid-month convention, and the midquarter convention. Conventions determine how much of the depreciation deduction the taxpayer may take the first year. This prevents taxpayers from claiming a full year's deduction when the asset has only been in service for part of the year. Governments generally provide opportunities to defer taxes where there are specific policy reasons to encourage an industry. For example, accelerated depreciation is used in some countries to encourage investment in renewable energy. Further, governments have increased accelerated depreciation methods in time of economic stress (in particular, the US government passed laws after 9‚Äì11 to further accelerate depreciation on capital assets). Example As a simple example, a company buys a generator that costs $1,000 that is expected to last for 10 years. Under the most simple form of depreciation, the company might allocate $100 of the cost of the generator to its expenses every year, until the $1000 capital expense has been \\"used up.\\" Under accelerated depreciation, the company may be allowed to allocate $200 of the cost of the generator for five years. If the company has $200 in profits per year (before consideration of the cost of the generator or any effects of debt or other factors), and the tax rate is 20%: a) Normal depreciation: the company claims $100 in depreciation every year and has a tax profit of $100; it must pay tax of $20 on the $100 gain. Over ten years, $200 in taxes are paid. b) Accelerated depreciation: the company claims $200 in depreciation for the first five years, and nothing for the last five years. For the first five years, it has no taxable profit and pays no gains tax. For the last five years, the company has a gain of $200, and pays $40 per year in tax, for a total of $200. To compare these two (simplified) cases, the company pays $200 in taxes in both instances. In the second case, it has deferred taxes to a much later period. The deferral of taxes to a later period is favorable according to the time value of money principle. (This example has been simplified for a basic demonstration of how accelerated depreciation works. It does not factor in an accurate class life, recovery period or account for convention.)

He contributed in particular to the study of the Epic of King Gesar, on which he wrote two books, and the use of Chinese sources in Tibetan history. He was the first scholar to correctly identify the Minyag of Tibetan sources with the Xixia of Chinese sources. Stein was born in Schwetz (now ≈öwiecie, Poland) to a family of Jewish origin in 1911. As a young man, Stein became interested in the occult, and it was from there that his interest in Tibet began. He received his first degree in Chinese from the Seminar f√ºr Orientalische Sprachen at the University of Berlin in 1933. He fled to France the same year. He obtained degrees from l'√âcole nationale des langues orientales vivantes in Chinese (1934) and Japanese (1936). In Paris he studied Tibetan with Jacques Bacot and Marcelle Lalou. He became a French citizen on 30 August 1939. Stein spent the Second World War in French Indo- China, working as a translator and where he was taken prisoner by the Japanese. He completed his doctorat d'√âtat in 1960 on the Gesar epic. Stein was a professor at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, Ve section (Religions de la Chine et de la Haute Asie) from 1951 until 1975. He was a professor at the prestigious Coll√®ge de France from 1966 until 1982. He died in 1999. He was married to a Vietnamese lady from the highlands and adopted a daughter of Vietnamese-French descent. Among Stein's most notable students were Anne-Marie Blondeau, Ariane Macdonald-Spanien, Samten Karmay, Yamaguchi Zuiho, and Yoshiro Imaeda.

Early life Born the son of a gentleman servant in Herefordshire, England, Ferguson became involved in juvenile crime as the ringleader of local teenage pranksters while his father was often away from home traveling with his master to London, Bath and other cities. At the age of 15, his father was able to obtain a position for him as a stable boy. As his skill in managing horses improved, he was sent to London to serve as a temporary postilion until his predecessor's recovery. Shortly after returning to his former position in Herefordshire as a stable boy, he began to have ambitions of gaining employment as a postilion. He found a vacancy with a lady, possibly due to his father's influence, and stayed on for a time before he was discharged by his mistress upon finding him in \\"an improper situation\\" with one of the female servants. Now in his early 20s, he was soon able to find employment elsewhere. However, he would frequently be dismissed for drunkenness, gambling, idleness and negligence, often drifting from job to job until being hired by a livery-stable in Piccadilly. After the death of his father, who left his son his life savings of ¬£57, he lived as a gentleman with his newfound wealth, often attending the theatre. A local courtesan, a favourite of many local highwaymen and other prominent criminals, apparently mistook Ferguson as a wealthy landowner. Spending much of his time with her, he quickly spent his savings on her and was soon forced to borrow money and other means to keep seeing her. He was soon forced to take a job in Piccadilly as a postilion at a local inn. However, he would almost always be in debt as he continued seeing the courtesan. Galloping Dick & Jerry Abershawe It was while driving a gentleman through the backroads of the city, when his carriage was stopped by two masked highwaymen. During the robbery, he recognized Jerry Abershawe as an acquaintance of his courtesan during the robbery however the two highwaymen were forced to flee as travelers approached. Meeting with Ferguson at an inn soon after the incident, he and his partner were able bribe him to keep silent regarding Abershawe's identity. However, he was refused by the courtesan who learned of his actual status and never returned to her house. He was soon approached by Abershawe who was able to persuade him to join Abershawe and his accomplice. It was later arranged by the three for Ferguson, who was able to observe wealthy guests at his inn as well as information from other drivers in the area, to relay this information to Abershawe. In time, Ferguson was once again found himself enjoying a frivolous lifestyle often using his wealth on alcohol and gambling. However, eventually finding himself unemployed due to his activities, he was obliged to become a highwayman with Abershawe. Although admittedly inexperienced, he showed great potential as an expert horseman earning him the moniker \\"Galloping Dick\\". Later years Following Abershawe's execution in 1795, Ferguson continued on his own with a successful career as a highwayman himself for five more years until his eventual capture by the Bow Street Runners in 1800. He was publicly executed soon after his trial at the Aylesbury Lent Assizes.

Rand Encyclopedia of Grapes p. 113 Webster International Publishers The grape is most commonly made into ros√© wine, particularly in the Anjou region.

Robinson Vines Grapes & Wines p. 199 Mitchell Beazley 1986 History The first documented plantings of Grolleau occurred in the Charente region in the early 19th century. Ampelographers believe that the grape is likely related to the ancient variety Gouais blanc.VITIS Ampelographical Dictionary \\"Grolleau\\" (in French) Accessed: 24 September 2009 The Grolleau vine's greatest popularity occurred during the mid- to late 20th century with the widespread marketing of Ros√© d'Anjou wine, of which Grolleau was the principal component. Often blended with Gamay, Grolleau-based Ros√© d'Anjou was a sweet wine. Towards the turn of the 21st century, Ros√© d'Anjou (and by extension Grolleau), started to fall out of favor in lieu of the Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon‚Äìdominated ros√© Cabernet d'Anjou. By 2000 there were only 5,500 acres (2,200 hectares) of Grolleau planted in the Middle Loire.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition p. 334 Oxford University Press 2006 The decline has been attributed, in part, to Grolleau's reputation for poor quality as noted by wine experts such as Jancis RobinsonJ.

Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pp. 202-204 Dorling Kindersley 2005 Wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr., has taken a dim view of Grolleau's potential, recommending in his wine buying guide that growers in the Loire Valley should rip up all Grolleau vines and replace them with grape varieties that have more potential for quality wine production such as Gamay and Cabernet Franc.R.

The Grolleau vine is found mostly in the Middle Loire region where it is a permitted grape variety for the ros√© Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC)s of Anjou, Touraine and Saumur AOC. The grape is limited to just ros√© wines and is not permitted by AOC regulations into the red blends of these regions. It is also permitted as an ingredient in the sparkling wines of the Cremant de Loire, Anjou AOC and Saumur AOC. Viticulture Grolleau is a high yielding grapevine that ripens reliably and relatively early for the cool climate Loire Valley-often right after Gamay. The vine produces medium-sized clusters clinging to the vine via its long, slender pedicels. The grapes are thin skinned with few phenolic compounds, but after veraison they produce color ranging from gray to bluish/black depending on the clone. There are currently five clones of the Grolleau vine authorized for viticulture in France. The vine tends to bud early which renders it susceptible to damage from spring frosts. Its long branches make its susceptible to wind damage, requiring that it be planted near hillside shelter. Grolleau is sensitive to several grape diseases including excoriose and stem rot. Wines Bottles of Ros√© d'Anjou with Cabernet d'Anjou Grolleau produces light bodied, fairly neutral wines with noticeably high acidity. It is often produced in off-dry to medium sweet style, leaving some sugars in the wine to balance with the acidity. Grolleau gris Grolleau gris is the pink- skinned mutation of Grolleau noir planted primarily in the Loire Valley. It is used mainly for the white wines of the Vin de Pays du Jardin de la France.J.

In theory, the net taxes paid should be the same. Taxes can sometimes be deferred indefinitely, or may be taxed at a lower rate in the future, particularly for deferral of income taxes. Corporate tax deferral Corporations (or other enterprises) may often be allowed to defer taxes, for example, by using accelerated depreciation. Profit taxes (or other taxes) are reduced in the current period by either lowering declared revenue now, or by increasing expenses. In principle, taxes in future periods should be higher. Income tax deferral In many jurisdictions, income taxes may be deferred to future periods by a number of means. For example, income may be recognized in future years by using income tax deductions, or certain expenses may be provided as deductions in current rather than future periods. A 2010 study documents the large extent to which U.S. taxpayers accelerate their deductible state tax income taxes by prepaying them in December, instead of their normally due January of the following year.Shon & Veliotis \\"December Effect: Strategic Prepayments of Deductible State Tax Payments,‚Äù Journal of the American Taxation Association, Fall 2010, Vol. 32, No. 2, 53-71. In jurisdictions where tax rates are progressive ‚Äì meaning that income taxes as a percentage of income are higher for higher incomes or tax brackets, resulting in a higher marginal tax rate ‚Äì this often results in lower taxes paid, regardless of the time value of money. Tax-deferred retirement accounts exist in many jurisdictions, and allow individuals to declare income later in life; if the individuals also have lower income in retirement, taxes paid may be considerably lower. In Canada, contributions to registered retirement savings plans or RRSPs are deducted from income, and earnings (interest, dividends and capital gains) in these accounts are not taxed; only withdrawals from the retirement account are taxed as income. Other types of retirement accounts will defer taxes only on income earned in the account. In the United States, a number of different forms of retirement savings accounts exist with different characteristics and limits, including 401ks, IRAs, and more. As long as the individual makes withdrawals when he or she is in a lower tax bracket (that is, has a lower marginal tax rate), total taxes payable will be lower. On the other hand, some people (primarily business owners) may choose to do the opposite of deferring their tax liabilities by \\"prepaying\\" personal income tax that would otherwise be payable in future years. For example, if it is known that tax rates will be increasing in a future tax year, a business owner can reduce his total tax liability by paying himself/herself a higher salary and/or bonuses in the current tax year, even if he or she has to loan the business money to do so. In most jurisdictions, the principal of such loans can be collected by the owner tax free at any time, thus allowing the owner to be paid a lower salary than would otherwise be the case once the tax rate increases. Alternatively, the owner of a new or struggling business can be paid a higher salary than his or her company can nominally afford to pay in hopes that when the business is more profitable, the amount of taxes owing in higher tax brackets will be less or none at all. At the very least, it is usually advisable for business owners to at least pay themselves enough salary to use up all of their basic personal exemptions for a given tax year, since these exemptions typically cannot be deferred to a future tax year. However, if applied aggressively, this can be a risky strategy depending on the jurisdiction ‚Äì if the business fails, the owners' ability to benefit from the nominal write-offs and losses accrued in earlier years might be limited or non-existent.  International tax deferral Taxes on profits derived from foreign investments may also be deferred via the retention and reinvestment of corporate earnings in foreign lower-tax countries. The advantages of this kind of tax deferral can be attributed to two partially interdependent effects, the tax rate effect and the interest effect: The tax rate effect is based on the fact that as long as the profit of a (supposed) subsidiary is not distributed to the domestic (corporate or individual) shareholder, the profit is not taxed in the shareholder's country. If the foreign tax rate is lower than the domestic one, profits can thus be retained in order to shelter them from domestic taxation. In case of exemption of foreign profits (as it is e.g. the case for corporate shareholders in Germany), this tax rate advantage is final. The interest effect derives from the fact that if the foreign tax rate is low, the tax rate effect on the net yield is growing with time as the amount of additional interest increases exponentially (interest advantage). Therefore, given equal gross yields, e.g. regarding mobile financial assets, it is more profitable to invest in low-tax countries: The net yield is higher in a low- tax country than in a high-tax country and hence the capital grows at a faster rate. That interest effect cannot be wholly eliminated, even if there is additional taxation upon distribution (e.g. like in a shareholder relief system or with the credit method).Schreiber, Ulrich/Ebert, Michael (2012): International Financial Accounting and Business Taxation, University of Mannheim.

The action is set on a set of small sand islands, which are interconnected by narrow bridges, and all the world is under a giant dome, similar to the one from \\"The Truman show\\". Inhabitants of each island try to conquer their neighbors. The mission is difficult primarily due to the fact that forces on each island are roughly equal in ability. Once one group takes over its neighbor island, it bears human losses and becomes vulnerable for an attack from a third side. The goal of the game is to take over all 40 islands, which is practically impossible to achieve. However, if they do so, the winning group will be sent back home. All children die at the age of 18, if they are not killed before. They use only cold weapons. A person who breaks the rules of the game usually accidentally dies or is killed shortly after such violation. The people also believe that they are part of some experiment, run by aliens, but have no idea where they are and what the goals of the experiment are.

The thread going through this book is what love is worth, and what can't be allowed even for the sake of love. {width=\\"15%\\"{width=\\"35%\\";Original title: \\"–ü–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –Ω–µ—Ç\\" ;Transliterated title: \\"Planeta, kotoroy net\\" ;English title: \\"The planet which doesn't exist\\" |width=\\"50%\\"; ;Genre: Space opera ;Written: 1991-92, Almaty |} |} With the main Enemy eliminated, why can't Serge just live with the Princess? The ancient vanished civilization, the \\"Seeders\\" (who seem to have born all known galactic races), left a Temple at each inhabited planet. A Temple is both a keeper of galactic customs, and a beacon for flights in hyperspace ‚Äì a selection of four beacons defines a destination in 3D space. The Earth is the only planet without a Temple, and no known combination of beacons leading to it. The people of Turr will not accept a Prince from a non- existent planet; and besides that, the Princess doesn't love Serge... The second book is devoted to efforts of Serge and his friends to find the Earth. It involves well-thought and credible starship battles, etc. Surprisingly, Serge finds a boy from Earth. This, and some other accidents, convince Serge's crew that they have an unknown enemy. A sect called \\"The Descendants of Seeders\\" also wants to find \\"the planet which doesn't exist,\\" to explode a quark bomb on it (a terrible weapon, turning a whole planet to atomic dust), thinking that only this will bring the Seeders back and make the universe wonderful. Who will reach the Earth first? It becomes a race for survival. {width=\\"15%\\"{width=\\"35%\\";Original title: \\"–°—Ç–µ–∫–ª—è–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ú–æ—Ä–µ\\" ;Transliterated title: \\"Steklannoe More\\" ;English title: \\"Sea of Glass\\" |width=\\"50%\\";, ;Genre: Space opera ;Written: 1991-92, Almaty |} |} The action in the final book approaches the level of total war between two interstellar civilizations with incompatible basic values ‚Äî and our friends are forced to be between the upper and the nether millstone. Despite harsh action, the style is somehow intrinsically poetic, even metaphoric ‚Äî Serge will have to deal with a different culture whose values are based on beauty. Death can seem beautiful, we see charm in destruction... but what lies beneath it all? Aren't pain and fright the real basis of all wars? Aren't all beautiful words justifying wars only the way that we, people, devised to reconcile our consciences with killing? What is the meaning of life, what is the sense of living? Everybody finds it in his own way, but the large ancient civilization of Fungs found it in beauty. They have a single word for \\"truth\\", \\"beauty\\", and \\"faith\\". They gave up wars long ago. Any Fung that killed another died, realizing the unbeauty of his act. But human culture has taught them otherwise... \\\\---- {width=\\"15%\\"The Boy and the Darkness {width=\\"35%\\";Original title: \\"–ú–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫ –∏ –¢—å–º–∞\\" (a.k.a. \\"–°–æ–ª–Ω–µ—á–Ω—ã–π –ö–æ—Ç–µ–Ω–æ–∫\\", a.k.a. \\"–î–≤–µ—Ä—å –≤–æ –¢—å–º—É) ;Transliterated title: \\"Mal'chik i T'ma\\" (a.k.a. \\"Solnechniy Kotenok\\", a.k.a. \\"Dver vo T'mu\\") ;English title: \\"The Boy and the Darkness\\" (a.k.a. \\"Sunny Kitten\\", a.k.a. \\"Door into Darkness\\") |width=\\"50%\\"; ;Genre: Young adult fantasy ;Written: 1993-1994, Almaty |} Partial English translation available online. |} A fantasy novel where a modern boy, Danny, comes to a world without sunlight. According to the inhabitants, the sunlight was sold a long time ago to some evil entity. In order to get back home, Danny needs to find some sunlight, or other instance of a matter called \\"True Light\\", that could help him open a door back into the real world. All the people are divided into the good Wingers, that live in cities, and the bad Flyings, that live in towers. The Wingers are descendants of the people who sold the sunlight, and the Flyings are a kind of undead who serve a Dark Lord. They are both capable of flying, and continuously fight each other in small local clashes. The plot is a quest, similar to Stephen King's \\"The Talisman\\".

It tells about virtual reality called \\"The Deep\\" and its main, and perhaps only city named \\"Deeptown\\". The book has written slightly before the web becomes popular, so some original fictional technologies are invented. The people from real world can get inside and achieve \\"full presence\\" effect using special psycho visual interface, called \\"deep-program\\". Due to that access to The Deep relatively expensive, most of the visitors spend only limited time inside. Once get inside, the people are able to detach their mind from The Deep only at the special \\"exit points,\\" that usually look like various exits at the real world, e.g. doors, restrooms, \\"end-level\\" buttons, etc.. The protagonist of the novel, Leonid, belongs to very rare kind of people who are able to enter and exit The Deep whenever they want, without using exit points. This ability makes them almost impossible to be harmed or caught by other people within The Deep. They are often hired for spying on or intruding other organizations and businesses. Also they're used to rescue the people, who are jammed out of exit points or can't exit The Deep alone. The story reaches its climax when Leonid realizes that he stalks a man who exists in The Deep on its own, without being connected from a real world. |} * \\"Big Zilant\\" Zilantcon award. {width=\\"15%\\"{width=\\"35%\\";Original title: \\"–§–∞–ª—å—à–∏–≤—ã–µ –ó–µ—Ä–∫–∞–ª–∞\\" ;Transliterated title: \\"Falshivie Zerkala\\" ;English title: \\"False Mirrors\\" |width=\\"50%\\"; ;Genre: Cyberpunk ;Written: 1998, Moscow |} Description (to be written) '' |} * \\"Silver Kladutsey\\" Star Bridge award. {width=\\"15%\\"{width=\\"35%\\";Original title: \\"–ü—Ä–æ–∑—Ä–∞—á–Ω—ã–µ –í–∏—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∏\\" ;Transliterated title: \\"Prozrachnye Vitrazhi\\" ;English title: \\"Transparent stained-glass windows\\" |width=\\"50%\\";ISBN NONE ;Genre: Cyberpunk ;Written: 2000, Moscow |} Description (to be written) |} \\\\---- The Stars Are Cold Toys ‚Äî Star Shadow {width=\\"15%\\"{width=\\"35%\\";Original title: \\"–ó–≤–µ–∑–¥—ã - —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ –∏–≥—Ä—É—à–∫–∏\\" ;Transliterated title: \\"Zvezdy - holodnie igrushki\\" ;English title: \\"The Stars Are Cold Toys\\" |width=\\"50%\\"; (1997 - , ) ;Genre: Space opera ;Written: 1996-97, Moscow |} |} {width=\\"15%\\"{width=\\"35%\\";Original title: \\"–ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–Ω–∞—è –¢–µ–Ω—å\\" ;Transliterated title: \\"Zvezdnaya Ten\\" ;English title: \\"Star Shade\\" |width=\\"50%\\"; ;Genre: Space opera ;Written: 1996-97, Moscow |} |} \\\\---- World of Watches Hexalogy Night Watch (aka, \\"The Night Watch Series\\"\\") {width=\\"15%\\"{width=\\"35%\\";Original title: \\"–ù–æ—á–Ω–æ–π –î–æ–∑–æ—Ä\\" ;Transliterated title: \\"Nochnoi Dozor\\" ;English title: \\"Night Watch\\" |width=\\"50%\\";, , , ;Genre: Urban fantasy ;Written: 1998, Moscow ;Published In English: 6 July 2006 |} |} * \\"Stranger\\" award in the nomination \\"Major form\\". * \\"Silver Kladutsey\\" Star Bridge award.

She is best known for her Nancy Chan novels. In addition, Quan has written a regular column for The Guardian website on pop culture, sex and politics and is involved in the prostitutes' rights movement. Biography Tracy Quan was born in the Northeastern US, but grew up in Canada.Naiman, Sandy (2001). \\"Confessions of a call girl\\". CANOE Lifewise Living. Her parents emigrated to the US from Trinidad; she has spoken of Chinese, Indian, African, and Dutch ancestors.Townsend, Emru (2001). The Critical Eye.Howley, Kerry (Nov 7, 2005). Reason magazine.Quan, Tracy (May 22, 2003). Time to Celebrate Asian Diaspora Month. Her parents divorced, and she credits her close relationship to her father to this experience.Buchwald, Laura (2001) Random House's Boldtype magazine Tracy Quan read Xaviera Hollander's book The Happy Hooker when she was ten years old and decided to be a prostitute. (Her prior aspiration, to be a librarian, was due to her image of librarians as independent, working women who got to collect money in the form of library fines.) By 19 she was supporting herself as a sex worker, working at an escort agency and a house before becoming an independent call girl with her own client list. As she told CANOE magazine in 2005, \\"I was never on the street. I've had a relatively easy time.\\" Quan notes she spent 15 years as a working girl in London and Manhattan, although she juggled both writing and sex work for a few years. As a writer, Tracy Quan first made a splash with her Nancy Chan: Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl column in Salon.com. Combining sex with a twice-weekly serial, the semi-autobiographical column centered on Nancy as she juggles her 'straight' boyfriend and family with her clients and girlfriends' problems. The story continues in the novels. Tracy expresses the emotional aspects of her life experiences in her novels, her fiction writing, and keeps her journalism for professional commentary on topics of interest: the plight of sex trade workers, changing sexual mores, topical media frenzies on public personalities such as the Eliot Spitzer scandal.Shackleton, Paula (2005) Author Podcast Interview BookBuffet.com Quan is currently a full-time writer, has been a columnist for The Guardian website and is a contributor to The Daily Beast. In 2010, Quan was a semifinalist for the 3 Quarks Daily Politics Prize, judged by Lewis Lapham. She has become a frequent guest on Morning Brew, a Radio 3 RTHK weekday breakfast show hosted by Phil Whelan, commenting on current events and social media. Philosophical and/or political views Tracy Quan served as a spokeswoman for Prostitutes of New York, or PONY, a sex workers advocacy organization.Wren, Christopher (Aug 19, 1997) New York Times: Life Gets Harder on the Already Mean Streets, retrieved on March 22, 2008. Quan has been described as a \\"libertarian entrepreneur\\", who advocates decriminalization of prostitution in the US.Tierney, John (Sept 4, 2001) New York Times: The Big City; Hypocrisy Is So Sexy In A Call Girl, retrieved March 22, 2008; MSNBC interview \\"Is America ready to legalize prostitution?\\" (Mar 16, 2010): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0BTx_ucjGE.

Established on 14 June 1988, the Cabinet Office provided policy advice to the Premier and state Cabinet. The office assisted in the co-ordination of government policy across departments, such as greenhouse emissions, alcohol misuse, and illicit drugs, amongst other issues of political sensitivity. The office was also responsible for facilitating the work of Cabinet through the provision of secretarial services. The office was led by Director General, Roger Wilkins, who resigned in 2006.

It is monophonic and has 32 keys. The MS-10 is well known for its huge sounding electro bass sounds. Architecture Audio path Oscillator The MS-10 has one VCO with 4 waveforms: triangle, sawtooth, pulse, and white noise. Filter The MS-10 has the same \\"KORG35\\" 12dB/Oct low pass filter as the original MS-20.http://www.timstinchcombe.co.uk/synth/MS20_study.pdf Resonance (\\"peak\\" in Korg parlance) is adjustable but not voltage-controlled. Originally, the filters used Korg's proprietary KORG-35 thick film IC. Later, the filters were redesigned to use off-the-shelf LM13600 OTAs. A useful illustration of the Korg-35 filter in-circuit is shown here https://web.archive.org/web/20150619232549/http://www.punkdisco.co.uk/misc/gear/Korg/MS20/Disassemble1.jpg and some photographs illustrating the later LM13600 filter daughterboard are shown here . The tonal difference between the two is that the original Korg-35 filter has a slight amount of hiss which overdrives into the sound at high resonant settings. This causes the filter to have more of a \\"screaming\\" effect similar to it being used with a distortion pedal. The revised filter has most of this noise cleared up and is less aggressive sounding. Output There is a simple single transistor VCA. The amplitude of the VCA can be controlled by the envelope generator. Modulation Modulation generator The MS-10 has one LFO, labelled \\"modulation generator\\". It has two controls (rate and shape) and two outputs (pulse and sloped). The shape control affects the pulse width and the shape of the sloped output. At midway, the pulse width is 50% and the output is a triangle wave. Both outputs are available through the patch panel and can be used for triggering the envelope generators ‚Äì the pulse wave with a key held down, and the sloped without. The depth of LFO modulation of the VCO frequency and the filter cut-off can be controlled from knobs in the respective sections of the control panel. Envelope There is one envelope generator with controls for Hold, Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release. Patching Although the MS-10 has normalized connections, they can be modified with patch cables. This allows the LFO to modulate the pulse width (which is called pulse width modulation, or PWM) of the VCO or the amplitude of the VCA. It also has a noise generator with white and pink noise outputs, CV in and out, and an external signal input (not to be confused with the \\"External Signal Processor\\" of the MS-20). Compatibility With Other Synths and Modules The MS-10's VCO uses linear voltage control (Hz/Volt) but note that V/oct scaling (‚àí5V to +5V) is available via judicious use of the \\"freq\\" CV input socket. A CV converter can also be used.
